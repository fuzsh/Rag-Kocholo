        "text": "By Grace Gay\n\nOver the course of quarantine, I’ve accomplished a few things I’ve been meaning to get done: learned some archery, finished The Americans, and maybe most crucially, finally read Gone Girl. Gone Girl has been on my list for a while; literally everyone in my life who has read it has said to me at some point, “You know, this is just your kind of book.” My “kind of book” loosely means a story made up of angry women, murder, and fun twists.\n\nWhat is it about Gone Girl that made it such a phenomenon? The femme fatale and vengeful woman aren’t exactly new tropes. But historically, it’s not a particularly nuanced one. Woman is hurt, woman is angry, woman uses sex to hurt men (spoilers?). I’ve done it, and so have women across the world and in pop culture. What makes Gone Girl innovative is that it takes that trope to its furthest level and then shamelessly calls on you to root for the villain, addressing something deep in the core of women’s roles.\n\nTo examine what makes Gone Girl so compelling, here’s one perfect example: the Cool Girl monologue. In the film, this moment is glorious, angry, and beautiful. It breaks the story wide open. Unlike the movie, in the book, this monologue comes surprisingly early, in Amy’s fake diary, as some of her real self bleeds into her false narrative. By moving the monologue to the moment the audience realizes Amy is alive, movie Amy’s Cool Girl monologue is even more filled with vitriol.\n\nCool girl is hot. Cool girl is one of the guys, while still being fuckable. Cool girl is a male fantasy. I’ve tried to be her, and so have a lot of women. Trying to be cool girl is exhausting. The book and the movie both understand this. What makes the story so evocative is that it keys into the anger I have carried for so long about the kind of woman you must be to be considered “desirable.”\n\nAmy Dunne is angry about being desirable and then losing it. She discovers herself in a marriage where everything she’s been taught about how women should act is not rewarded. She grows tired of playing by society’s rules. But Amy, while powerful, could never be called a feminist. She hates women, both others and herself. At once, she has a precise feminine vulnerability and repression, and a specifically white rich privilege of always having her way that results in the worst kind of rich, white feminist: the one that believes she’s got it the worst of anyone around. Amy Dunne is the worst version of who we want to be, in both delicious and despicable ways. The pleasure of Gone Girl, both movie and book, comes from getting to see what would happen if you unleashed all your female anger on the world. Amy is angry, selfish, manipulative, emotional, and vindictive. She’s the kind of woman you’re told not to be, and more importantly, the kind of women misogynists imagine is real. She feeds into toxic stereotypes and old lessons on women’s deviousness.\n\nThe villainy of Gone Girl does not come from Amy’s rage, though, but from where she directs it. Yes, her husband sucks. He’s the most masculine man--afraid of his feelings, traditionally handsome, and a mama’s boy with daddy issues. Nick is a model of toxic masculinity, just as Amy is a model of toxic femininity. And because of the role she’s been taught to play, she doesn’t see society as the problem. Patriarchal society, not Nick, was what made her into Cool Girl. Amy attacks the individual, not the root source of the problem.\n\nBut, while Amy herself is far from a feminist, I believe there can be a feminist reading of the story. It says what I wish I could. Gone Girl channels the anger that I want to use to destroy the patriarchy. Ultimately, it’s a female rage fantasy. Just as the most masculine, toxic men get to be heroes in every action movie under the sun. Amy is the conquering hero of a story that is deeply cathartic. It’s cathartic like explosions or Tom Clancy novels are for my grandfather: Amy lets out all the rage I feel inside, becomes the worst version of myself, and she doesn’t get punished for it. She wins."
