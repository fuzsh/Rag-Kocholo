        "text": "PRAISE FOR Cassandra Speaks\n\n”When did we as women start trying so desperately to tame our feelings, our bodies, our ambition? In this powerful and beautiful book, Elizabeth Lesser brings us back to the earliest stories that convinced us to silence our voices, and then forward to a place where we trust ourselves to lead our lives -- and the world.” —Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times Bestselling author of UNTAMED, and founder of Together Rising\n\n“Here’s what I learned reading this blazingly wonderful book: All those stories and myths that I unconsciously absorbed? They were wrong. They defined, limited and contained me. Now it’s time for women to know the truth and rewrite the tales. Every chapter of this book hit home. It gave me strength, comfort and hope. That’s what women do, and that’s what we need most in the world right now.” —Sally Field, Academy award winning actor and bestselling author of In Pieces\n\n“In Cassandra Speaks, Elizabeth Lesser speaks to the value of finding your voice in the wilderness of these times. It’s about a new kind of hero’s journey, one that replaces violence and domination with deep feeling and courageous communication. It’s about the power of love instead of the love of power. What a blessing!” —Iyanla Vanzant, Author, Host, Iyanla Fix My Life (OWN)\n\n“Blessed are the truthtellers, and Elizabeth Lesser is one of them. Cassandra Speaks is astute and witty, tender and soulful. It’s a tapestry of memoir, cultural commentary, and spiritual fuel that inspires women—and all people left out of history’s storytelling—to reclaim our lineage, to become prophetic alchemists in a world in grave need of healing.” —Jamia Wilson, Executive Director and Publisher of the Feminist Press\n\n“Elizabeth Lesser is a wise and powerful storyteller. Cassandra Speaks helps us understand the roots of women’s shame and guilt and offers a path forward—by changing our stories, we change our lives. “ —Eileen Fisher, founder, EILEEN FISHER, Inc.\n\n\"A book that will change women’s lives—and therefore, everyone’s lives—by calling out the stories that have held us back for millennia. Cassandra Speaks delivers an urgent message to women to listen within, follow their instincts, and do power differently.\" —Alyssa Milano, actor and activist\n\n“Cassandra Speaks is a nod to the power of storytelling in our journey to build a truly equitable society. It lays bare the relationship between gender and power and makes a compelling case for deepening our connections and embracing our collective humanity. “ —Tony Porter, CEO of A CALL TO MEN\n\n“Elizabeth Lesser does something remarkable in this book. She puts words to something so obvious, that it has been entirely hidden from view. And she does it in a way that leaves us with no choice, but to effect change. Few things give me hope as of late. But this book does. —Jeff Brown, author of Grounded Spirituality and An Uncommon Bond\n\nREVIEWS\n\nKirkusreviews.com -June 20, 2020 \"Lesser, co-founder of the Omega Institute, an adult education and retreat center in Rhinebeck, New York, draws on her own life, research on gender, and cultural myths to explore challenges to women’s power. Cassandra seems to her emblematic of women’s subjugation: Cursed by Apollo after she rejected him, she would forever be disbelieved. Although her prophecies told the truth, “her words fell flat.” Cassandra, like Eve, Pandora, and many other mythical and fictional women that Lesser cites, represents men’s views. “So much of the sorry state of our world hangs on the excess of the so-called masculine virtues in our guiding storylines,” writes the author. “So much was lost with the disparaging of anything coded feminine and the erasure of women as protagonists and heroes.” Why, for example, are there no monuments to women’s achievements but countless statues of male warriors? Invisible and silenced because of nature, nurture, and “the wounds of patriarchy,” women, Lesser believes, share a tendency to feel self-doubt, shame, and reticence, internalizing expectations “to stay in a narrow lane: mother, caregiver, keeper of the hearth, mender of the hearts, cleaner-uppers of the mess.” These qualities—nurturing, emotional intelligence, and “relational nature”—shape women leaders who are likely “to be more collaborative” and “less prone to corruption, to instinctively move to fill the empathy deficit, to seek wiser solutions to conflict.” To encourage women who, like her, are “trying to excel and contribute within a system built by and for men,” Lesser offers exercises designed to promote both activism and what she calls innervism: “the part of me that seeks inner change, inner healing.” These include meditation, guided reflection, listing sources of inspiration, prompts to help talk to someone with differing views, and writing one’s own obituary. An encouraging guide to help women redefine their lives.\"\n\nPublishers Weekly -July 6, 2020 “Omega Institute cofounder Lesser (Marrow) demonstrates how myth, religion, and history minimize women’s voices and values in this lucid and ultimately optimistic account. Criticizing traditional, male-dominated lists of great books and histories that glorify war, Lesser suggests alternative stories of women who “meet adversity with love,” such as Malala Yousafzai, Antoinette Tuff, and Tammy Duckworth. She advocates “innervism” as a corollary to feminist activism, encouraging women to focus on looking at “our blind spots, our projections, our hypocrisies,” and offers detailed meditation exercises to help women learn how to “Do No Harm and Take No Shit” and find the courage to “give clear voice to... healthy anger.” Citing her work helping 9/11 first responders to overcome their “strong and silent” conditioning and share their feelings, Lesser ties the cultural devaluing of women with the discrediting of feminine-coded values like empathy, sharing, and care, and argues that leaning into these values would improve the world for men and women alike. Emphasizing individual over community work, Lesser does not address whether it’s necessary to build spaces in which women can be heard, and her guidance on how women can tell their own stories is minimal. Still, readers will find this lucid and detailed presentation of feminist ideas motivating. “\n\nTo inquire about scheduling an appearance or book reading with Elizabeth, contact Melissa Eppard at lesserelizabeth@gmail.com"
