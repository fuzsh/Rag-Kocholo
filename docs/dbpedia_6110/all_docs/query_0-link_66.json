        "text": "Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ray Liotta are answering the call for Millennium Films’ “Hero Wanted.”\n\nBrian Smrz will make his directorial debut with the film, which centers on a garbage collector who stages a bank robbery so he can be the hero and stop it in order to impress a girl who works at the bank. When the plan goes awry, he seeks revenge against the double-crossers. Chad and Evan Law penned the screenplay.\n\nShooting is set to begin next month in Bulgaria.\n\nRichard Salvatore, Johnny Martin and David Ornston are producing. Millennium’s Trevor Short and Boaz Davidson are executive producing.\n\nSmrz worked as a second-unit director on such tentpoles as “Superman Returns” and “X-Men” before landing the “Hero” gig.\n\n“I was very impressed by Smrz’s creative vision and felt he would bring real style to this project,” Martin said.\n\nThe Oscar-winning Gooding’s most recent credits include “Norbit.” He next will appear in Ridley Scott’s “American Gangster” opposite Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. He is repped by CAA, 3 Arts Entertainment and attorneys Jake Bloom and Ralph Brescia.\n\nLiotta co-stars in the road-trip comedy “Wild Hogs” and recently starred in “Smokin’ Aces.” He is handled by Endeavor and Untitled Entertainment."
