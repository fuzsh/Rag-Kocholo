        "text": "Well, now that I am starting to think about the plot for my thriller/ revenge trailer, and to some extent, the film itself if it were to be made, I thought that carrying on my research into the genre could do nothing but help my understanding of it. So now my film/trailer analysis is moving on to ‘Sleepers’ one of my favourite films about revenge that I have come across…\n\nThe trailer I’m analysing is below, and as I did in my ‘Dead Man’s Shoes’ analysis, I will pick the trailer apart and explain how it relates to the film and vice versa…\n\nSweet Lasting Revenge…\n\nWhat I do like about this trailer is from the very off we know the film will be about revenge. The opening clip is taken from about halfway through the film, which means the audience is pushed straight into the middle of it all without any introductions or equilibrium. Which I think is an interesting technique as it leaves them a bit confused and gives them a taste of what sort of film is being promoted here. It also prevents boredom setting in. Of course, hearing one of the main characters (Michael) say: ‘I read words like revenge, sweet lasting revenge’ will instantly interest the viewer as they will want to watch on and perhaps see hints to what he is really talking about- did something bad happen to him? Does he want revenge? We don’t know, so the audience watch on to try and find out.\n\nFour Friends…\n\nAnd then are given the equilibrium, which consists of flashbacks to the childhood years of our 4 main characters: ‘Shakes’ (Lorenzo), Michael, John and Tommy. It quickly introduces them to us and establishes that these are our protagonists. The clips of the boys messing about and having fun are, to be honest, limited, when in the film this section where the characters are still young boys lasts for about an hour of the film. But in the trailer I suppose this is all we need to establish that these boys are young and carefree and just want to have fun. But from what we have heard about revenge the audience start to think- does something happen to these boys that they later seek revenge for?\n\nWhat I like about this part in the trailer is that this is when we are first introduced to character Father Robert Carillo. We hear him say to ‘Shakes’: ‘I don’t want you to get into any trouble.That’s all I wish for you and your friends.’ and this quickly establishes his role within the film- he is a helper and mentor to the boys and desperately tries to get them the best start in life, which is hard for the very rough area which they all live in. But in the film, he is seen to try his best. And I suppose we don’t see that much in the trailer because maybe it can left out because of time issues/wanting to keep the trailer fast paced/giving too much away. Maybe the trailers thought it was a good idea to leave all the doors open to who the villain was, and at this early stage, many may point the finger at an ever so eager Father Bobby…Well, I certainly thought that when I watched the first half of the trailer!\n\nAnd then of course, the voice over starts. The only thing I don’t really like about the trailer at all. It just takes away the dark and horrible tone the film itself has and makes the audience just think that the trailer is not original and is the same as every other blockbuster film out there. Anyway, despite my hatred of voice overs (especially cheesy ones like this one) I have to hand it to them: it does give some good hints as to what the audience can expect from the film itself. Such as:\n\n‘Four Friends…’ Well, at least they have their facts straight. It tells the audience the film has four protagonists who look like they are pretty close friends. So could the film be about friendship? And how does this link to the statement we saw earlier about revenge?\n\n‘Raised in a legacy of crime..’ Now this is good because it tells no details, it just hints to the crime surrounding our young protagonists and how it might affect them later on in the film. But it doesn’t mention how any of the boys may be affected by it or whether this could lead to the ‘revenge statement’ we saw earlier on (which I can safely say, it doesn’t). It also implies violence, which leaves the viewers to decide whether they might like to watch the film or not, which, judging from past questionnaire results, they like.\n\nKing Benny…\n\nAnd then we have a short but vital little piece giving us the first little disruption in the equilibrium: where one of our main characters (Shakes) is seen to ask for a ‘job’ form what looks like a mobster. Which as the audience can figure out, probably will involve doing something that is breaking the law. But of course, they are not told that, and it leaves them to wonder that if this character (King Benny) hires him, what will he make the young boy do? And will this have any long lasting affects on the character to leave him wanting revenge? And also, why does ‘Shakes’ want the job in the first place?\n\nAnd it’s a good idea that we aren’t told the facts because audiences watching the trailer can confuse themselves thinking all kinds of things that ‘Shakes’ is asked to do by King Benny, when in truth, he asks him to just deliver a package. But then again, what we don’t see is that this soon gets ‘Shakes’ into a lot of trouble and two men are shot because of it. Which honestly, is a good thing to leave out and keep the audience guessing on what ‘Shakes’ did on these various ‘jobs’ for King Benny. And it also leaves the question unanswered of how Michael, Tommy and John all got in on doing jobs for King Benny also, which in truth, was because ‘Shakes’ was scared after the incident I just explained and felt he needed protection.\n\nAnd then we hear Father Bobby stepping in and asking the boys: ‘You think running for King Benny is a good idea?’ which is showing, like before, that he is concerned about the boys and just wants the best for them. The thing is: he knows that this is the beginning, that soon this introduction to crime will absorb them completely- so can stop it before it spirals out of control? And if he tries, how will he go about doing that? Will he be successful? We are left to believe not, and quite rightly so I might add, as one of the boy’s remarks: ‘It pays’ very naively and this insinuates that although they know Father Bobby is right, they are led on by the promise of money and this will perhaps lead them to eventually make the wrong choices in life.\n\nOne thing that I find interesting about this trailer is the fact King Benny is not mentioned as much as he is in the film itself. I think this is good as King Benny is a really big source and symbol for the thirst for revenge set in the boy’s hearts and by keeping him out of the trailer this doesn’t give too much of the story away. His story teaches the four boys about revenge and the lengths some men will go to get it. The story, which I like a lot also, goes like this:\n\nWhen King Benny was a kid, he was hitman for a local criminal,\n\nHe wasn’t very well known on the street and was said to be a wimp, nothing special,\n\nAnd then one day, an Irish guy flings him down a flight of stairs for no apparent reason,\n\nKing Benny breaks all of his front teeth,\n\nHe waits 8 years to get his revenge,\n\nHe goes to the Irishman’s house, where he is having a bath,\n\nHe takes out his teeth and says: ‘Every time I look in the mirror, I see your face.’\n\nHe shoots the man twice in each leg and says: ‘Now every time you have a bath, you’ll see mine.’\n\nNobody messes with King Benny after that.\n\nI think it was good this little story was left out because I just think it’s used for added effect- it isn’t vital for the audience to hear it in the trailer and would probably take up too much time to fit it in. But in the film- it a beautiful moment- where we see how far one man will go to get his revenge and how much an incident like what happened to King Benny can play on a character’s mind.\n\nThe Hotdog Cart…\n\nAnd then, one of the biggest disruptions in the equilibrium: the hotdog cart incident. Yes, this is where things really do start to go downhill for our protagonists. And the voice over says to us: ‘When a childhood prank…resulted in an accident..’ this lets us know that although the kids do something really really bad they meant no actual physical harm to whomever they are implied to hurt. What they did was an accident and they are not bad characters. But as we see clips of a man being injured by the cart they accidentally dropped down a flight of stairs (interestingly similar to King Benny’s revenge story!) we wonder the extent to what the boys have done, how this happened and what the after effects will be…\n\nWe are quickly given the results: they are sent to a juvenile prison for around a year. And as the innocent young boys hang their heads and stare into the distance, teary eyed, this ultimately this leads us to think about the four characters and how this sentence is going to affect them in the long term- will it link to the ‘statement of revenge’ seen at the beginning of the trailer? How will their families/Father Bobby/King Benny react to them being sent to prison at such a young age? Will they be able to survive prison life? And if this affects their adult years, which we can guess that it probably will, how does it?\n\nAnd I think it’s quite interesting that we aren’t told that ‘Shakes’, who is the narrator of the film, is given a shorter time sentence for prison because of the fact he ‘arrived on scene’ later than the other boys and after the theft of the cart had taken place, or something along those lines. Which I think would be interesting to hear for audiences as they would wonder how the boys will react to this and what ‘Shakes’ will do when he is released and his friends are still behind bars. But I suppose, since the whole scene with the ‘prank going wrong’ isn’t actually revealed in the trailer I think it’s only fitting not to mention that either.\n\nA Punishment they didn’t deserve….\n\nAnd then the equilibrium is disturbed even more by the fact that the voice over states: ‘The Punishment…was far more than they deserved.’ and combined with this we see the boys being sent to prison and introduced to the guards who will be looking after them. The voice over implies that their punishment goes much further than we would have originally have thought, and seeing the guards, most notably Sean Nokes, stating: ‘You gotta have rules and you gotta have discipline’. the audience can imply that the guards are going to hurt the protagonists- but we want to know the details of what they do to the boys, whether the boys will fight back, and what the consequences of this torture will be.\n\nOf course in the film we are told the full and painful extent of what torture the guards put the boys through. They abuse them physically, mentally and s*xually every day of their sentence, violating the boys they have so much power over. And this, a side from being very painful and heartbreaking to watch at times, gives us reason to think that when the boys eventually leave the prison, the memories of their time there will never leave them. It will stay with them forever, and determine what kind of men they become. But of course the trailer is not going to give all of this dark and disturbing stuff away, other wise there would be no point in watching the film- no they give a few hints to the ‘lunch room’ scene where Nokes forces them to eat off of the floor and where he leads them down a dark corridor but what follows these incidents is all implied. Nothing needs to be shown because that’s what makes the trailer so dark- that we know he is going to do something horrible to them, but the full details are not given to us yet. Which of course, makes it all the more horrific. And it’s this subtle hint at violence that I want to achieve in my trailer- that we know something bad is about to happen or something horrible but we are not actually shown it happening.\n\nAnd I’d like to point out that we hear another character state: ‘it’s a lot of power to have over a boy isn’t it?’ which confuses the audience as it implies someone else is aware of what’s going on and does not like it- so will they help to stop the abuse the boys go through at the prison?\n\nWell, if you watch the film it may confuse you as this scene is in fact from the court case which is much later on in the film and much much later on in the protagonist’s lives. And when what happened to the boys is blown straight out into the open for everyone to see.\n\nThe truth stays with us…\n\nIt’s then made clear that whatever happened to the boys, they share between them. They don’t want anyone else to know the full extent of the pain and torture they went through- as John says: ‘I don’t want anybody to know’ it implies that they are afraid to admit or express fully what happened tot hem which again, implies that whatever happened was horrific and we instantly want to know the details. We also want to know what will happen to the boys if they choose to bottle this all up and try to move on- will they be able to? Or has the damage already been done? When Michael says: ‘We might aswell not even talk about it, the truth stays with us.’ this implies that the boys have a silent agreement and we know that none of them want to dig up these old nightmares- but is this the last they’ll hear of it? Will the truth stay with them, or will it eventually come out into the open? This is what the audience naturally want to know.\n\nI think it was a good idea to put a part of this scene in the film, because this is where most of the torture scenes are over, and the boys have some time to talk it over amongst themselves. At first some of them believe that if they tell someone when they get out, it could make things better for them. But then they come to the conclusion that bringing back up what happened to them will not make anything better. Their best bet is to live with it. As Michael says: ‘We’ve got no choice but to live with it, and talking makes living with it harder. So we might aswell not even talk about it.’ I like this because even though the boys all agree that this is the best option for them, this cannot erase what they have been put through. It will live with them forever, like Michael says, and they will never be able to forget it.\n\nReunited with revenge…\n\nAnd then there is a clear flashforward when we hear the (annoying) voice over quip: ‘Years later, they bound together,‘ and see four men hug and embrace happily, telling us that our protagonists, now all grown up, meet up with each other again. But what has happened to them since their release from the prison? How have their lives been affected by what they went through? And more importantly- where has it lead them to in adult life?\n\nPersonally, I like the choice of shot in the trailer because it is as misleading as can be. It looks as though the boys will all reunite happily and together when in fact, in the film, they are first reunited under very different circumstances. John and Tommy are on trial for the murder of Sean Nokes, Michael is prosecuting them and ‘Shakes’ is on the sideline, watching the case play out. So by implying they meet up under happy circumstances this leaves out what John and Tommy did and will confuse the audience when they eventually come to watch the film itself. And anyway, this shot is from the end of the film, where the group have their last friendly meeting and it is their last night together as the four of them.\n\nWe then here a very confusing piece dialogue where a female character argues:’He went in there and asked for the case, now you tell me, what the hell kind of friend is that?!’ and I think this is confusing as this character hasn’t actually been introduced in the trailer and in the film she was introduced in around the beginning of the film (Carol, a girl who was close friends with all of the protagonists and even had relationships with John and Michael). And I think that what she is talking about is quite confusing too- as it sounds like there is some kind of court case happening but we are unsure of what the actual details of this is. And this makes us want to watch on- what court case is this? How does it involve our protagonists? Did one of them commit a crime? There are also hints at betrayal of friendship, which could imply revenge within the group and we want to know the details of this supposed betrayal of friendship.\n\nI think it’s good we’re only told this much as the trailer makes us naturally want to know more about what is going on. We hear there is a court case but no details are told- when in fact in the film Michael is prosecuting John and Tommy for the murder of ex prison guard Sean Nokes. At first it seems as though Michael is betraying his oldest and best friends but what he really is doing is helping them to walk free. By rigging up every single aspect of the court case so that the defence cannot possibly lose. But we aren’t told that in the trailer, are we?\n\nAnd the annoying voice over goes off again: ‘In a pact to avenge…those who destroyed their innocence.’ Well this is where it’s obvious that the boys do get their revenge. The audience can figure out from the voice over and the two men brandishing guns that the boys grow up, still plagued by what happened to them, and then somehow, run in with one of those who destroyed their childhoods and innocence. Of course we aren’t told the details of how they come face to face with their torturers, and it could be anything: they could track them down or just happen to pass them in a bar one night…we don’t know. And it seems obvious they do get their revenge…but what will be the result to this? How will others react? And more importantly if only two of the boys get their revenge, how will the other friends react to this?\n\nOf course in the film it is John and Tommy who happen to come across Nokes in a bar one night and seize their only opportunity for revenge. So they confront Nokes, and then kill him without any thought of how people may react to their actions or what this could mean for their future. All they see is their torturer, the person responsible for ruining their innocence and giving them nightmares for the rest of their lives. So, honestly, their only thought is revenge. Of course I think it’s a good idea not to give too much away but I think the audience can gather it from the hints the trailer gives us anyway.\n\nWe then go back tot he conversation that started the whole trailer off, between an older Michael and ‘Shakes’ and we hear a bit more of their conversation: ‘you still sleep with the light on?’…I think this is a beautifully tragic thing to include int he trailer. It hints at how the tortures they went through every day affects every second of their adult lives. Like children, they sleep with the light on, afraid of the dark and the symbols of what it used to bring to them in the prison: torture. He then goes on to say:‘It’s payback time.’..’It’s our time.’ Which links back to the revenge statement we had at the start of the trailer. It hints that the boys are planning to get their revenge, but of course, the details aren’t given to us, which is why we go and watch the film!\n\nYeah I think they might give a bit too much away here…because they hint at what is going to happen, which is good for a trailer, but I think they hint a little too much for their own good. The reason is because it is obvious that somehow they kill Nokes, which I think just gives away the fact they eventually DO get their revenge. Because we see a flash of a gun, see a scared older Nokes and put two and two together. It just hints a little too much and makes everything too obvious. I think it’s a bad move by the trailer making people anyhow.\n\nFlashbacks/montage the whole lot…\n\nAnd then we get a harder and faster montage with a little more tension and a lot of dialogue. Here we get flashbacks to the way the boys were treated again, a lot of it focusing on Nokes. We hear him shout intimidatingly: ‘I don’t think you know the meaning of rules..RULES? YOU UNDERSTAND?!’ I don’t think this has any actual relevance to where the story is going but it is a nice touch to remind the audience of what a horrible and disgusting man he was, and perhaps this will take away any sympathy they may have for him when we see he is shot and murdered. We want to be on the side of the heroes, not the villains.\n\nTo rustle things up even more we see a grown up ‘Shakes’ talking to Father Bobby. He seems to be asking the priest for a big favour, saying things like:‘We need someone to take the stand…’ and therefore it is implied that ‘Shakes’ wants Father Bobby to help him do something to the trial. But we still don’t know the details of this case and also who is being prosecuted. But getting Father Bobby involved hints that ‘Shakes’ is only getting those closest and dearest to him to help- so he must be up to something he can only tell those he trusts. So what is he doing? Is he tampering with the case? Why is he doing that? And also, what is he asking Father Bobby to do for him? Will he do it? Etc\n\nLinking to what I said about ‘Shakes’ seeking help from old friends and mentors (like Father Bobby) we then see a new character, who we aren’t properly introduced to. And he is having a conversation with none other than King Benny- the man the boys admired and worked for. The new character states: ‘This is a murder case, I am afraid I’ll make a mistake’ so we now hear that there is murder case going on. Well the obvious question is: who was murdered and who did it? But I think it’s obvious by now that Sean Nokes was murdered by one or maybe some of the boys- but who? And why is this character afraid of making mistakes? Is he incompetent or has been sent to do a specific job? We wonder what part he is going to play in the case and whether he will, like he predicts, mess up. We then hear King Benny reply:‘Then you’ll go down for the dirt nap.’ which I am pretty sure implies that he will be killed if he doesn’t do his job properly. So has ‘Shakes’ asked King Benny for assistance too? And if so, what are the details of this assistance and why is he going to such extreme lengths to get the outcome he wants?\n\nOf course in the film we know that this character is a part of Michael and ‘Shakes’ big ‘plan’ to get John and Tommy off the hook while revealing all the torture they went through as boys. This character is defending John and Tommy’s case, and is told exactly what to do by Michael so that he has total control over the case- what is said and what isn’t etc etc…So I think leaving out the details of what part he plays is useful in the trailer so that not too much about the case is given away and that audiences can wonder as to what he is talking about, making up their own (and probably wrong) ideas in their heads.\n\nWe then cut to ‘Shakes’ in a police car, which is suspicious in itself, giving a gun to a police officer. Even more suspicious. A policeman then asks: ‘how did you get it?’ And he coolly explains:’ It fell into my lap.’ I think this is a good part to include in the trailer as it looks so confusing and suspicious- what is ‘Shakes’ doing in a police car? And why does he have a gun? Where did he get it from and why is he handing it in? And more importantly- how does this link to everything else we’ve seen in the trailer? It’s confusing and hints to crime and corruption, which is good because the film includes a lot of this, especially when we go to the present day.\n\nThe reason I liked the use of that clip is because it implies so many of the wrong things and actually portrays no truth to the film itself. Seeing ‘Shakes’ in a police car implies he is perhaps in trouble with the law or is squealing or something like that, which is in fact very far from what he is doing. In fact he is giving the police information on one of the guards who tortured them when they were boys and revealing what he is so that he will get arrested and the boy’s revenge will be one more step towards completion. Which is not implied in the snippet the trailer shows us at all.\n\nWe then go back to the court room where Michael says to Father Bobby: ‘A priest wouldn’t lie, has anyone questioned your word before today?’ And Father Bobby replies: ‘No but there’s a first time for everything.’ We now see that Father Bobby does take the stand, but id he going to do whatever ‘Shakes’ requested him to? Or will his faith prove too strong to lie in court? We don’t know, and we don’t know what consequences his statement has on the protagonists.\n\nOk now this really is giving too much away- this clip makes it plainly obvious that Father Bobby is going to ‘take the stand’ and probably lie for the boys when in the film it’s supposed to be a big tension building thing. We are left waiting for a long time to find out whether Father Bobby will even turn up in court, let alone whether he’ll do whatever ‘Shakes’ asked. And by showing the clip from Father Bobby in court, being asked lots of questions about truth and lies just implies too much to the audience.\n\nSo, how’s it all going to end??…\n\nSo then we move on to the next montage- the faster one with a lot less dialogue…so I’m going to analyse the shots the best I can. Yes and we start by coming back to none other than Sean Nokes. This implies his importance in the film itself as flashbacks to the days when he was a prison guard keep appearing in the trailer everywhere. To be honest it’s rather like the boy’s minds: they cannot shake what Nokes and the other guards did to them from their minds- it is lurking behind every corner they turn. So naturally in the trailer he will prop up a lot, like a remind of the horrific things he has done.\n\nAnd then we see another clip of Father Bobby and this implies his importance in the film too- he played mentor to the children when they were young, so will he help them out of the tight spot they’re in now and get revenge? Well, the trailer’s already made it obvious that it does so erm is this relevant?? Probably not.\n\nNow this is good: just a flash of a typewriter can instantly confuse the audience. Obviously what’s being written is important to the plot otherwise it wouldn’t have been put in the trailer but just how important? And what is it? Is it a letter? Or something else? We want to know and we want to know how it is relevant to the plot…but nothing is really revealed.\n\nBut the film reveals to us that the way Michael and ‘Shakes’ work to rig the court case is the fact that they cleverly write secret scripts of what the defence has to say so that Michael knows everything which is going to be said and explained. And that gives him the upper hand: he is in control of both the defence and the prosecution, so he has a good chance of getting his old friends off of this murder charge that was a simple act of revenge Sean Nokes truly deserved (in my opinion anyway). But it’s good the trailer doesn’t tell the audience this as it is one of the only things they don’t make unbelievably obvious: how Michael and ‘Shakes’ try and get their friends off of their murder charge. And giving that away I think, by judging what else the trailer has given away, would make watching the film pretty pointless.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, we see a man, in the middle of nowhere, put his hands in the air as a gun is pointed at him and fired. This being an extreme long shot means we don’t get to really see the identity of the person being shot: all we can be clear about is that this character is male, and as the film looks pretty male dominated, this leaves the door open to pretty much any character. Which is a good idea for a trailer as it keeps the audience guessing- they want to know who is being shot and why. And also has it got anything to do with this whole revenge thing??? I think most audiences would make this implication…\n\nWhich it kinda does…but not how the audience would think. In fact it is actually a different characters revenge on one of the guards as the prison for boys. In the film, we get more details about what the boys and their fellow inmates were put through every second of their sentence. And in one scene it is declared there is going to be a football match: Inmates Vs Guards. The guards get practice every day, the inmates are picked a week before the game and are allowed only one practice match to prepare for the beating the guards are going to give to them. But the protagonists see this as an opportunity to fight back and let the guards know ‘how they feel every day, just for an hour’ and to do so they enlist the help of Rizo, a fellow inmate who the guards won’t mess with. With his help they put up a fight against the guards in the match and eventually win: but at a price. They are each beaten to a pulp and put into solitary confinement for weeks without food or light. But Rizo pays the ultimate price and is beaten to death by the guards. With this still fresh in his mind, ‘Shakes’ sends King Benny to tell a local criminal gang leader what really happened to Rizo (Rizo was this character’s nephew) and then lets him know where he can find one of the guards that helped kill his nephew.\n\nSo that’s what we see in the trailer. We see revenge, but it’s not quite what the audience may think judging from what else we’re told, as Rizo and his eventual death isn’t even mentioned in the trailer. It’s deceitful, which is what I think makes trailers interesting.\n\nWhat it doesn’t tell you…\n\nOf course, trailers don’t want to tell you everything. That’d ruin the film for the audience. So hears the pieces from the film which I thought was essential NOT to tell audiences in the trailer…\n\nWell, it’s pretty much the end scene. Where John and Tommy (thanks to a little help from their friends) are announced as innocent. Though the audience know they are really guilty, we can’t help but feel happy. They got their revenge and they got their friends back. But is the damage that the guards inflicted upon them too deep to ever remove? It appears so. The end scene of the film I found to be tragic. We hear that although they have got their revenge: Sean Nokes is dead and the other guards either admitted everything or were killed/imprisoned, their revenge still cannot take back what they did. And as the group all start singing, ironically: ‘Walk Like a man’ ( I love the choice of song because of the fact the film is all about the boys having their innocence destroyed and it just seems very ironic) ‘Shakes’ cold and flat narration slowly drowns out their happy dialogue, leaving us with cold silence as he tells us the fate of his friends, as we see their happy, joy-filled faces at what is revealed to be their last real get together.\n\nJohn is said to be killed I think by being smashed in the head with a bottle of Alcohol. He died young. And a haunting black and white photo of his dead body flashes onto the screen,plunging shock into the audience’s hearts. We then are switched back tot he happy, singing character we saw earlier, joking with his old and closest friends, unaware of his fate which we have just seen.\n\nThe same happens with Tommy. He is shot five times at close range. He died young also. A similar haunting black and white photo is put onto the screen and then we cut back to an equally happy Tommy. Who, like John, is unaware of his fate. But we have seen it. It’s what makes the audience focus their attention onto the screen and makes them think.\n\nWhat I like about this is that, after all ‘Shakes’ and Michael did. After they got their friends off of a murder charge, after revealing the truth about the prison they were abused in so long ago, after getting their revenge…they still couldn’t save their friends. The damage had been done and no revenge, however extreme it was, could erase that. Their innocence was stolen from them, and it triggered something in these two characters. As we hear a flashback of a young John screaming at a guard: ‘You won’t ever touch me again! No one is ever gonna touch me again!’ and I’m sure in the book it explains that John and Tommy came out of the prison as different people. According to ‘Shakes’ his friends never came out of that place. They were destroyed by the abuse they suffered every day and two angry and rage-filled criminals took their place.\n\nAnd then we have a flashback to a very heart-warming clip of all the friends together, including Carol. (like a past version of the singing in the restaurant scene) And it reminds us of how the protagonists used to be absolutely inseparable, but now, two of them are dead. And the others could do nothing to help them. It’s a tragic story, and we really feel no remorse for any of the guards. They destroyed the boys lives- the boys who were once innocent and could have made a better life for themselves are now either dead, or alive and still living with the never-ending nightmare of the hell they were put through. And it ends with the lines: ‘And we thought we would know each other forever.’ really summing up the fact that what these guards did ruined the bond they thought unbreakable. And not even the best possible revenge could change that."
