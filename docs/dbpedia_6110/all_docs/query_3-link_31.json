        "text": "The history of human civilization is full of examples of human destructiveness towards human. Some occurred at the individual level, while others were at the mass level. Some others overflow and become objectivized only as works from the inner world of artists in fantasy. It is seen that the sense of revenge, which has the potential to reveal remarkable stories, has a significant effect on ordinary people and is closely related to the concepts of justice, faith, violence, and morality. The stories of individuals or societies with a desire for vengeance have appeared throughout history in myths and artistic works. Vengeance is one of the remarkable themes in many cinematic works in which the relations of crime violence, and moral problems in the individual and social fields are processed. South Korean director, Chan-Wook Park’s revenge trilogy called Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002), Oldboy (2003), and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance (2005) presents a multilayered view of revenge, problematizing its representations in cinema. In this study it is aimed to reveal the feelings created in the audience with the sense of revenge that drives the characters (affect) imaged through Chan-Woo Park’s Oldboy film and how they produce a cinematic experience as an aesthetic strategy. In this context, it is seen that the director stylizes the sense of revenge throughout the film through many characters as a deep philosophical problem and as a morally impeccable-looking emotion that drives the narrative of the film. In Oldboy, the radical critique of revenge suggests that purification and redemption with deliberate images will be impossible because the act of revenge will only lead to its perpetuation. The film presents the nature of the connection of revenge to the myth of Oedipal incest and its punishment with reference to Freud’s conceptualization of the Oedipus complex.\n\nThe index to the 2018 VideoHound Guide to Films suggests that under the broad heading of “revenge” there have been something in excess of 1000 films. This appears to be the largest category in this comprehensive guide and suggests that this is, indeed, a theme which permeates the most influential sector of popular culture. These films range from influential and lauded films with major directors and stars like John Ford (The Searchers (1956) and Alejandro González Iñárritu (The Revenant (2015)) to “straight to video” gorefests with little artistic merit and a specific target audience (The Hills Have Eyes (1977)). There is, as the Film Guide numbers suggest much in between like Straw Dogs (1972) and Outrage (1993). The making and re-making of “revenge” films continues with contributions in 2018 from such major stars as Denzel Washington in The Equalizer 2 and Brue Willis in Death Wish. Within this body of film is a roster of films which allow us to speculate on the nature of the legal...\n\nDespite being a prevalent theme in popular cinema, revenge has received little dedicated attention within film studies. The majority of research concerning the concept of revenge is located within moral philosophy, but that body of literature has been overlooked by film studies scholars. Philosophers routinely draw on filmic examples to illustrate their discussions of revenge, but those interpretations are commonly hindered by their authors’ inexperience with film studies’ analytical methods. This article seeks to bridge those gaps. The 2010 remake of I Spit on Your Grave is used as a case study to illustrate the benefits of an interdisciplinary engagement with revenge. Philosophical literature on the topic has routinely posited that revenge is either appealing or appalling, and that impasse has stifled conceptual understanding. The interdisciplinary approach employed here elucidates that revenge is simultaneously appealing and appalling; this dualistic nature is evident in I Spit on Your Grave since it is built into the narrative design. I conclude that an interdisciplinary approach to revenge has the potential to advance understanding of revenge-qua-concept both within films studies and philosophy."
