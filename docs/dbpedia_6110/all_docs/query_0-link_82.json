        "text": "The film is set around 230BC during China’s Warring States period, when the country was divided into seven warring kingdoms each vying for supremacy. The tyrannical king of Qin finally defeated six rival kingdoms in a series of brutal campaigns, and unified China for the first time. (Spoilers below.)\n\nThe story, which was conceived by Zhang, is loosely based on a failed real-life assassination attempt. Hero tells the tale of a fictional group of assassins from the kingdom of Zhou who set out to kill the tyrannical king of Qin because he is waging total war on their literate and civilised kingdom. In a nod to Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon, the story – which is told in flashback – presents various different iterations of events until the truth is finally revealed.\n\nJet Li Lianjie plays Nameless, an unknown swordsman who has devised an invincible attack move that will allow him to kill the king from 100 paces – the closest that anyone is allowed to come to him.\n\nTo gain entrance to the king’s fortress, Nameless aims to win his trust by attempting to kill three martial artists from Zhou who had failed to assassinate him in the past: Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung).\n\nBut Broken Sword convinces Nameless that national unity is preferable to chaos, even if that unity is brought about by a murderous tyrant. The assassination attempt is ultimately abandoned, allowing the king to continue with his bloody conquests and unite China.\n\nIn an interview with American television show Cinema AZN, Zhang said that he had been a fan of martial arts novels since his childhood. Zhang grew up during the Cultural Revolution, and read a wuxia novel in secret, as most books had been banned for being anti-Communist.\n\n“If the book had been discovered, it would have meant trouble for the whole family,” he said. “But ever since then I have become truly consumed by martial arts literature. I have always felt it is a playful and engaging subject.”\n\nZhang had never directed an entertainment film, and had no experience of directing martial arts scenes, so he hired Hong Kong director and martial arts choreographer Ching for the swordfighting sequences in Hero. Ching was an old friend, as he had directed Zhang as an actor (and Gong Li, who was then Zhang’s lover) in 1990 fantasy action film A Terracotta Warrior.\n\nChing directed A Chinese Ghost Story and Swordsman II for Tsui Hark, and is known for his frantic and fantastical fight sequences, which make prolific use of crazy special effects and props. But the combat scenes in Hero, shot by Christopher Doyle, are just the opposite – they are gentle, carefully composed, and make heavy use of slow motion.\n\nAlthough the scenes are pretty, the constant slow motion has the effect of abstracting the fight scenes and removing their tension. Directors of martial arts films always try to slow their performers down, as sometimes their real-life moves are too fast to look effective on screen. But Hero’s choreography is so slow and stylised that the fights appear more like formalised dances than combat.\n\nZhang said he had no knowledge of martial arts films, and did not know the rules of the genre. This resulted in a kind of “outsider” film. The genre’s typical themes and tropes, such as trying to square Confucian and Buddhist values with the need to commit violent actions, and the duty to avenge a murdered family member, simply do not figure in his story. His characters are modernised variations of wuxia heroes who possess very contemporary personalities.\n\nZhang has described has the film’s message in cultural rather than political terms, saying that it emphasises the “idea of bodily sacrifice … that an individual should sacrifice himself for the benefit of the whole”. But it’s difficult to ignore the film’s propagandist politics, which are a justification of China’s philosophy that authoritarianism is better than chaos.\n\nZhang has said the film is not political, but that is difficult to believe. He is not a naive filmmaker, and his early films cleverly hid well-planned criticisms of Communism inside their period settings. Zhang frequently ran into trouble with the authorities, and films like To Live were often temporarily banned.\n\nNot One Less and The Road Home – the films he made before Hero – saw Zhang transition from being a rebel to the political establishment’s favourite filmmaker, and Hero seems to be part of that pattern.\n\nIn this regular feature series on the best of Hong Kong martial arts cinema, we examine the legacy of classic films, re-evaluate the careers of its greatest stars, and revisit some of the lesser-known aspects of the beloved genre.\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Martial art-house cinema with some contentious politics"
