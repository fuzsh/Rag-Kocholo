        "text": "Movie Ethics; Do movies reflect\n\nsociety or affect society?\n\nJohn Perkins\n\nPurdue University\n\nFeb 13th, 2008\n\nMovie Ethics; Do movies reflect society or affect society?\n\nHolding innocent people hostage, attending Neo-Nazi meetings, “drugging” humans, stealing, blowing up buildings, killing; these are all usually considered very bad, illegal, and unethical things to do. However, we see all of these actions in the movies by main characters, some “good guys” and some “bad guys”, and the odd thing is that we sometimes root for people to perform these actions and get away with it. I will be analyzing several movies, their ethical dilemmas, and how audiences react to the main characters’ decisions and then discussing the impact these movies have on society.\n\nWhat Kind of Ethical Movies There Are\n\nI have broken down most movies where the main character is experiencing an ethical dilemma into six different categories; Family in Danger, Family Held Hostage, Betterment of Humanity, Revenge, Peer Pressure, and Following Orders. It seems that in most of the popular movies the “hero” is faced with doing something that would normally be wrong and illegal in order to fulfill one these established categories.\n\nFamily in Danger\n\nJohn Q. starring Denzel Washington as John Quincy Archibald is about a boy who needs a heart transplant to live. His parents cannot afford the transplant and the insurance will not cover the expenses. John even resorted to selling his television, car, and other luxuries that his family had. John is out of options and decides to hold the people in the Emergency Room hostage until the doctors and hospital directors agree to perform the transplant. What becomes very intriguing about this movie is the fact that the gun was not loaded and John never harms any hostage other than punching one man for trying to overpower him. (Cassavetes, 2002)\n\nThe first question that should be asked when breaking the law to save a person in danger is, “what is one life worth?” Society, religions, and most people would tell us that there is no price value for a life. But the contradiction of breaking the law by putting others in danger to save one is very interesting. John never actually caused harm excluding getting into a fist fight with one hostage. John’s gun was not loaded, though he led the people to believe it was. He did threaten to kill hostages if the police and hospital refused to help. The new question to ask now is, “Is the threat of harm unethical if being used to save someone’s life?” Interestingly enough our history in America can answer this question. When we separated from England with the signing of the Declaration of Independence, we were basically saying, get your troops out and stop taxing us or else. This at the time was clearly high treason punishable by death. Today, these men that created and signed the document are considered heroes and patriots. John represented the American colonies that were perhaps being unfairly and unjustly treated and therefore decided to use threat of force. John needed help and the insurance agency, hospital, and several others turned him down. How much is one life worth? John knew what he was doing and what could happen to him because of his actions but he chose the path anyway because he felt he was doing the right thing. I could only hope I would have someone that courageous that would fight for my life. (Cassavetes, 2002)\n\nPeer Pressure\n\nAmerican History X is about a boy who has a brother that is just getting out of jail. Edward Norton plays the older brother that is getting out of jail. He was a former Neo Nazi leader. When he gets out of jail he finds his younger brother is on the same path that he was. Edward Norton’s character, Derek, after getting out of jail has had a change of heart in his beliefs realizing that there is good and evil in every race of man. He is faced with going back into that world to get his brother out or simply avoiding it. (Kaye, 1998)\n\nDerek in this movie represents the classic “least expected to be” hero in that, for the greater part of the beginning of the film, we see him as a young man peer pressured into being a bigot that is good at gathering followers. Derek’s ethical dilemma comes in three parts; first, will Derek, while in jail, choose to get help from those that he used to hate and hold strong biases against or will Derek simply choose to go through his sentence and consider it a waste of his time? The second dilemma Derek is faced with is whether or not to get back involved with his former racist groups to get his brother out or take the easy way out and avoid all temptations and conflicts. In the end Derek does find a way to accept all men for who they are and he eliminates his brother’s racist views as well. However, Derek’s brother is ironically killed at the end of the movie by two black schoolmates he previously antagonized. The final dilemma that Derek is faced with is whether or not to help the police take down the former organizer of the Neo Nazi organization. Most would say that Derek makes the right decision in going through with working with the police. Another way to look at it though is whether or not Derek is being ethical by double crossing his former companions. Can two wrongs ever make a right? The book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible tells us that there is a time for everything. Perhaps there are times for everything including double crossing depending on its context. (Kaye, 1998)\n\nRevenge\n\nA Time to Kill starring Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey is about a black man whose ten year old daughter is viciously raped, beaten, and left for dead by two white men simply because the girl is black and defenseless against them. Carl Lee knows of a similar case in which the men got away with the crime. He therefore decides to take the law into his own hands and kill the men as they enter the court. Carl Lee is seen in the movie as a completely sane person, however the defense in his trial is that he was temporarily insane. Carl Lee ends up getting off as not guilty after his lawyer tells the jury the whole story of what had happened to his daughter. (Schumacher, 1996)\n\nOf all the movies I have in this paper the toughest “hero” to justify is this character. Carl Lee did commit murder and he was not legally insane at the time of the crime, however, that does not make the average audience member in favor of rooting against the man. Again we have come upon the “can two wrongs make a right” question. Carl Lee felt that if he did not deliver justice then no one would. What is really important to consider is whether the two men deserved their fate. The death penalty has always been a very controversial subject and I am not going to argue one way or the other. The fact is, the death penalty exists and it may have been applicable in the attempted murder and rapists’ case. Therefore, Carl Lee could have just given the defendants’ sentence a quicker course of action. Another question to be asked is whether or not taking the law into your own hands should be allowed. What if a girl is being raped and she simply says, “Oh, I’ll let him do it and then he’ll get what he deserves in court.” A girl fighting back, kicking, biting, and scratching are simply her taking the law into her own hands. We do live in a world where there is a double standard. No court would find her guilty of anything but self defense. It is funny how we create terms for when it is and is not okay to take the law into your own hands. In the United States Declaration of Independence it is written about the unalienable rights of men, “That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.” This is clearly stating that if the government is not doing its job, it is not only the right but the responsibility of those who have the ability to take action. Carl Lee did make one clear mistake; he never waited for the government to not uphold justice. Perhaps if these men would have gotten off after trial, one could more easily argue for the reasoning and the justification. The question still remains though of whether or not what Carl Lee did was ethical. This may be one movie that I feel the main character did not do the right thing though I do not believe he did the worst thing. The two men did commit the crime and did deserve the consequences of their actions; however, Carl Lee did not yet have to perform the justice himself. Carl Lee should have waited until after the trial to see if the courts delivered the justice. He could have done worse by not doing anything even if the men got off. We live in an imperfect world and the law can make mistakes on delivering justice. When this happens, it should be our right and duty to see that justice prevails. (Schumacher, 1996)\n\nOrdered\n\nA Few Good Men starring Tom Cruise as Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a hot shot lawyer known for plea bargaining in the Navy, is about a trial where two Marines were illegally ordered to perform a “Code Red”, a form of harassment used for punishing those men that were not totally up to standards, which in turn killed the man they were harassing. The two Marines were ordered by their superior officer to perform this “Code Red” that resulted in the victim’s death. The victim had a serious condition that the medical doctor ignored when signing off on his physical that caused this man to have conditions such as shortness of breath that in turn made him not up to par considering he should not be running a lot and performing the kinds of activities required of him at the base. The two Marines get off on the counts of murder but are still dishonorably discharged for conduct unbecoming of a United States Marine. (Reiner, 1992)\n\nIn this movie it seems that the courts made the biggest unethical decision of all. The decision basically said that even though the Marines did the “right thing” by following orders, which they could have been court marshaled for not following, they still did the wrong thing for not standing up for the victim. No matter the decision the two Marines made after being given the order to perform the “Code Red” they still could and most likely would have suffered the same fate. Some people have a saying that the world is not fair. I disagree. The world is very fair; people are unfair. People’s decisions make this world unfair. In the case, these particular laws, made by men, were poorly thought out. If the Marines disobey a direct order they get in trouble, but if the Marines follow such an order as they did they still get in trouble. As far as what the two Marines did in performing the “Code Red” and whether or not that was ethical, it seems clear that Marines are “programmed” to not question orders and because of this it is unfair to say, “They should know better.” Furthermore, during the film a Marine from the same unit was brought onto the witness stand and he testified that he had in fact been the recipient of a “Code Red” before. This shows us that these “Code Reds” were in fact a common practice at this base. If the two Marines are guilty of conduct unbecoming a United States Marine, should not every single Marine at the base that has performed one these also be given the same charges? Performing a “Code Red” may in fact be unethical; however, when the decision making ability is taken away from someone, such as a Marine, we cannot blame them for doing what they are told. (Reiner, 1992)\n\nFamily Hostage\n\nI would like to analyze several films for this category due to the fact that “families held hostage” is one of the most common of ethical dilemmas in movies for the hero. Gone is Sixty Seconds stars Nicolas Cage as Randall 'Memphis' Raines. Randall is a former car thief that is forced to choose between coming out of retirement and stealing fifty cars or letting his brother be killed for not completing the job. In the end Randall steals all the cars and the main detective actually catches up to him but not before Randall saves the detective’s life. Randall tells the detective where all the cars are and the detective decides to let him go. (Sena, 2000)\n\nThis is a classic tale of committing a wrong act in order to perform the greater good. Randall is not interested at all in stealing the cars; he even tries to buy off the men who hired his brother with his own money. Randall is not given the luxury of being allowed to simply pay off and walk away. What Randall did do was break the law, but can we blame him? If a person has a gun to a hackers head and says hack the Internal Revenue Service or die, it hardly seems fair to blame the hacker for breaking the law. This seems to be a very similar case in this movie. It is often human nature that one would rather die than let a loved one parish. Randall loved his brother and would rather face jail time than let his brother die. Randall did a very ethical thing in that he put his brother’s life before his own. It is a commendable and rare quality in people today. (Sena, 2000)\n\nFirewall is a movie about a man faced with stealing several million dollars from the customers of the bank that he has built the computer security for or letting his family that is being held hostage die. Harrison Ford plays Jack Stanfield, the computer security officer of his bank. Throughout the movie, Jack is trying to find ways to get away and to not perform the act of stealing the money. He ends up stealing the money but he also rescues his family, kills the bad guys, and gives the money back. (Loncraine, 2006)\n\nIn Firewall we see Jack constantly defying the men who have kidnapped him and his family. With some analysis one may come to the conclusion that Jack was being unethical “gambling” with his family. At the end of the movie, Jack is successful but there were several close calls and times where the kidnappers could have injured or killed some of his family. In one pivotal moment in the movie, the kidnappers give Jack’s son a cookie with peanuts in it. Jack’s son is very allergic to peanuts and nearly dies. By this point it would seem the best thing to do would be to do what the “bad men” say and save your family. Then after your family is safe you could go to the authorities and let them track the kidnappers down. Life is not always filled with the luck that movies create and gambling with one’s family hardly seems a good idea in real life. (Loncraine, 2006)\n\nSwordfish, starring John Travolta as Gabriel Shear and Hugh Jackman as Stanley Jobson, is about Stanley creating a gigantic computer virus capable of stealing millions of dollars from a bank. Eventually Stanley starts becoming less and less eager to help Gabriel steal the money. Gabriel then decides to kidnap Stanley’s daughter and force Stanley to finish the job. Gabriel wants the money to wage war with any terrorist groups that attack America. Gabriel is actually part of a very secret group working for the government to perform these actions. Gabriel’s theory is to make the consequences of attacking America so dangerous that no one would consider it. (Sena, 2001)\n\nStanley begins his job for Gabriel without any real hesitations. This was clearly an unethical decision that Stanley made. Instead of researching his new found “partner’s” background before beginning the job, Stanley finds out more about Gabriel as he is completing his work for him. Only after he realizes that Gabriel may be a more evil man than he thought does Stanley decide to be defiant. Stanley ends the movie ethically by making the money jump from location to location essentially holding it hostage until Gabriel lets everyone go. Gabriel ends up getting away but without the money thanks to Stanley. Another person we should analyze in this movie is Gabriel. Gabriel’s rationale sees himself performing these acts of “anti-terrorism” for the greater good. What is very interesting is a conversation that Gabriel and Stanley have that essentially talks about the killing of one innocent child in order to find the cure for cancer. Stanley comes back at Gabriel asking what if it was one hundred innocent children to save potentially hundreds of thousands. Stanley says he would not do this. Gabriel and Stanley at this point of the movie are clearly not on the same page ethically speaking. Stanley refuses to harm innocents and Gabriel sees them as a means to an end for the greater good. The problem becomes where do we draw the line with the “means to an end” and when does it go too far? (Sena, 2001)\n\nBetterment of Humanity\n\nAgain I would like to analyze several films as this seems to be the category used the most overall in movies focusing on ethical dilemmas. Equilibrium, starring Christian Bale as John Preston, is about a society that no longer experiences feelings. The government, and in particular one man, had developed a serum that would be taken several times throughout the day that kept people from experiencing feelings. This lead to a Utopian society that was very peaceful and efficient. However, there is a group of underground people known as “sense-offenders” that stopped taking the serum and enjoyed feeling. John’s job is to find these offenders and terminate them. At one point John misses a dose and starts feeling. He too realizes the life he is missing. The rebel group, with John’s help, takes control over the manufacturer of the serum and blows up the supply stores for them as well. We are led to believe that this will mean all humans will start feeling again at the end of the movie. (Wimmer, 2003)\n\nThe ethical dilemma that I would like to analyze in this movie is that of the government and their serum to “cure” emotions which lead to hatred, violence, and war. One could argue that the government in this movie is simply considering the common “greater good” approach to ethics. What I find especially interesting is how the audience is quickly led to believe this is a terrible act the government has performed within the first few minutes of the movie. Could it be that movies such as this change the social norms of what we consider ethical simply to suit themselves? It would seem that sometimes the best way for movies to create “bad guys” is too create a “bad” scenario that negatively affects normal citizens the audience can relate to. It seems more likely that this movie is taking a common established belief and using that to fuel specific emotions they want the audience to have. Most people would consider our emotions unalienable rights of humans (Wimmer, 2003)\n\nNational Treasure is about treasure hunters looking for the lost treasure of the Knights Templar. Nicolas Cage stars as Ben Gates, a man who is “passionate” about finding this treasure. While he is searching for it he finds out that a partner of his is going to try to steal the Declaration of Independence because the document is the next clue the team needs to find treasure. Ben decides that the only way to protect the document is in fact to steal it himself. Ben succeeds in stealing the map, avoiding capture by the authorities and by his former partner, and he finds the treasure. At the end of the movie he wants to give all the treasure to several museums to “share with the world.” Ben does not go to jail, though at the end of the movie the FBI catches up to him, instead Ben gives them his former business partner whom he had sent on a wild goose chase due to the fact that Ben and his father made up a clue to lead them the wrong way. (Turteltaub, 2004)\n\nThis movie is one of the more easily arguable “ethical” movies. Ben several times throughout the movies explains why certain things need to be done such as stealing the Declaration of Independence and lying to Ian about the clue at the end of the movie in order to put Ian, the “bad guy” on a wild goose chase and give our heroes time to free themselves. Ben realizes that Ian has no respect for the document and he knows that if he has it, he will take care of it and keep it from Ian. He therefore knows that the document would be safer with him than any other place. Having a reason and being able to fully support your decisions with well thought out logic is one of the most important aspects of ethics. If a person can reasonably say this is why they committed such a theft it does seem reasonable that the law should be lenient on that person. At one point in the film Ben is giving a toast and he toasts to high treason because that was what the men who signed the Declaration of Independence were in fact committing when they signed the document. But those men knew what the right thing to do was and they did it, just like what Ben did to keep the document and treasure safe. (Turteltaub, 2004)\n\nV for Vendetta starring Hugo Weaving as a man simply known as V is the story of one man trying to open a society’s eye to the corruption of their current government. V believes that by blowing up the Parliament building in England he will remind his countrymen of Guy Fawkes and his quest on the fifth of November in 1605 to blow up Parliament because he and his friends believed that the country should be Catholic again and that the country should not form its own religion simply because its king says so. V announces his intentions to the nation on a television broadcast. V was successful in finding support among the people as thousands showed up dressed like him the day he said he would blow up the building. V also has a side story where he is going around killing several people involved with the government’s experiments to create a Pandemic and then control the Pandemic with a miracle cure. In the end V is dying and he leaves the decision of whether or not to blow up the building to a young woman whom he has fallen in love with. The woman was pushed by V to see the government for what it really was and to now be able to live without fear of the government. She does blow up the building. (McTeigue, 2006)\n\nV for Vendetta strongly reminds me of National Treasure. V feels the government is no longer representing and supporting the people. This is V’s motivation in the movie, along with revenge. By the end of the movie V realizes his revolution must not be fueled by revenge but by an idea, an idea that the government does in fact represent and support the people and that it does not overpower and dictate the people. Benjamin Gates’s ideas of high treason from National Treasure could in fact be used as support for V’s actions as well. V does in fact get called a terrorist at one point, but V is only committing acts of terror against an oppressive government and he is therefore the constituents’ freedom fighter in effect. One could challenge V’s means to that freedom. One could ask if killing is necessary. I would ask them, “Do you really expect to win a fight with words against someone with a shotgun held to your face that would just as soon kill you as he would take a breath?” V has a quote in the movie where he discusses the uses of violence and how it can be used for good. Buddhists may disagree but in the Christian Bible in the book of Ecclesiastes it talks about how there is a time for everything. Just like in American History X and any ethically challenging situation for that matter, there can and is a time for any and all actions. (McTeigue, 2006)\n\nSaw is a movie series about a man known as Jigsaw wanting to teach people to truly appreciate life. Jigsaw is played by Tobin Bell. Jigsaw would build contraptions to see if people were willing to sacrifice their comfort and perform amazing acts such as cutting off their foot, killing someone, cutting out their eyes, and several other more gruesome acts simply to stay alive and better appreciate their lives that they seem to have taken for granted. (Wan, 2004)\n\nJigsaw throughout all the four movies never actually kills anyone. Jigsaw puts people in situations where they can choose between some form of torture and discomfort or “letting” themselves die. In essence, Jigsaw feels he is teaching these people a better way to live. He chooses people that he knows are not appreciating some part or aspect of their life and he “teaches” them a lesson. Saw dabbles into the theme means to an end. One may still have trouble justifying Jigsaw’s actions due to the fact that his “games” are too extreme and very tough to live through. It would be hard to know where the line is drawn on situations of a means to an end. How are Jigsaw’s actions any different than what V did in V for Vendetta? V killed for his beliefs and reasons. The audience was led to believe that V was killing bad men for a good cause. Jigsaw was supposedly picking on “bad” men as well, and Jigsaw would give them at least a chance at life. It seems that if the audience is emotionally bound to a victim and sees there good sides at all, the audience will then feel that killing them is not the best course of action. Is this a double standard that the audience has created, or is it a simple “trick” by a director to create bad guys and good guys? (Wan, 2004)\n\nRobin Hood is a character that is known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. He is known as a hero to most as he fights the evil Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham who tax the people too much. I would like to focus on three of the more popular films we see this character in. Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves starring Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn as Robin Hood, and Robin Hood the Disney version starring the voice talents of Brian Bedford as Robin Hood. These three movies all show Robin Hood in a very different light with different motivators fueling his actions. (Reynolds, 1991) (Reitherman, 1973) (Curtiz, 1938)\n\nThe animated version of Robin Hood is a very ethical version of one of the most notorious thieves of all time. In this movie we see Robin Hood stealing gold from the evil Prince John. What makes the prince so evil is the fact he taxes the citizens to poverty without every spending those tax dollars on them. The whole point of taxing is to give the government money to spend on citizens whether it is protection, shelters, healthy living, and several other things for the citizens. Robin Hood was the hero of the people because he was willing to fight to get the people’s money back. (Reitherman, 1973)\n\nThe Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood is also an ethical depiction of the character. Prince John is taxing heavily and governing “his” lands strictly. Prince John is also plotting ways to steal the thrown from his long lost brother King Richard the Lion-Heart. In this depiction, all the money that is “stolen” from Prince John is held and protected and not spent by Robin Hood or his men. Robin Hood holds the money for the King as he and his men feel the money belongs to the King. Robin Hood in this movie only steals from Prince John. (Curtiz, 1938)\n\nKevin Costner’s portrayal of Robin Hood is the most questionable of the three mentioned. Robin, in this movie, first got “involved” because of a quest for revenge of his father. As stated several times earlier, revenge can in fact be ethical. Revenge can be used for justice when our established laws and governments do not enforce justice. Another difference in this representation of Robin Hood is that we actually see Robin stealing from someone other than the Sheriff. This is the most unethical thing I have seen or read of any version of Robin Hood. Rich people deserve their money; after all they worked for it. To think that simply because someone is rich they have to make donations is in fact an act of stealing. Bill Gates, Michael Jordan, Mel Gibson, Oprah, and several others have worked for their money and earned it. Yes, sometimes people inherit money, but a child’s easier life is what most parents strive for. Every parent I have heard talk about their child they all say that they want their children to have a better life than they had. Who are we to deprive them of this? Robin Hood has no reason to steal from the rich and give to the poor. A more ethical version of Robin Hood would steal from a tyrant and ask of the rich for contributions for the poor. Even with all these unethical actions that Robin commits throughout the movie, audience still find him to be the hero of the film. Perhaps Robin’s underlying theme and large contributions to the film for acting ethical is enough for audiences to find him a good man. Stealing for unjust reasons from innocent men is not and cannot be ethical. (Reynolds, 1991)\n\nConclusions\n\nIt would seem that the majority of these selected movies can be arguably ethical. Our heroes are portrayed as doing questionable things but ultimately making the correct decisions. It is interesting that when highly analyzed some movies’ heroes may not be making the best choices. This leads me to believe that in general movies simply reflect our society’s established core values. However, occasionally movie makers want to spin their ideas and theories and perhaps “test” the validity of their ideas.\n\nThe question of where ethics comes from in the first place seems to be a very common one I have ran across. I would never claim to be able to answer this and quite frankly, I would never put much weight into anyone, even a so called “expert’s” opinion. All I can do is share the origins of my ethical values. I feel that my parents were the first and most influential contributors to my values and principles. It would seem that most of the unethical people I could think of in my past always had very similar parents. Another large contributor would be my religious beliefs. My Christian roots tell me that there is a time for everything. This contributes to my feelings that we need to treat every situation as a completely separate and independent course of events. Several other factors have contributed to my values and principles including past experiences, friends’ beliefs, and perhaps even movies.\n\nMovies can help shape opinions and ideas about several things if we simply think about movies such as Team America, The Sound of Music, The Wizard of Oz, Peaceful Warrior, and several others. These movies can lead us to have biases towards groups of people, teach us how to appreciate, and show us how to live. If a movie can do that, it seems little doubt that a movie can help us form our ideas of what is and what is not ethical. The movies above may be reflecting our current beliefs but the movies could also be subtly reinforcing our moral standards and also forming our new ideas. Just as important as moral formation is reinforcement of those beliefs so that one can mold them into their values. Perhaps the next time you watch a movie you should ask yourself just what would you do in that situation and can you answer the question of, “why would you do that?”\n\nReferences\n\nCassavetes, Nick(Director).
