        "text": "Chester Cyrus Snyder, Jr. age 90, passed away from this life on June 19, 2024, after a gradual decline in health. At the time of his death, he was surrounded and supported by his loving family and caregivers.\n\nChester (Chet) was born to Chester and Irene Snyder on January 19, 1934, in Kansas City, Missouri. He graduated from Southeast High School in Kansas City, Mo. After attending University of Missouri, he joined the U. S. Marine Corps with a tour of duty in Korea. His time spent as a Marine made a lasting impression and he patriotically wore a Korean Veteran cap wherever he went.\n\nAfter separation from the Marine Corps, he began his career in the banking business working for Plaza Bank on the Plaza. His banking career spanned over three decades. It is at this time he met his future wife of 66 years, Jo Ann and they were married on November 23, 1957, and made their home in South Kansas City and then built a house in Grandview, where they remained until recently. After retirement from his career in banking, he spent several years transporting cars for Enterprise. Throughout his retirement he enjoyed spending time at their lake property on Truman Lake. Boating and fishing were his passions. Opening Day for Trout fishing on March 1st was an annual event for Chet, his sons: Chuck & Curt and grandson, Cody. They would stay in a cabin in Bennett Springs, Missouri the day before March 1st and be standing in the water when the bell rang to signal the first cast. On his fiftieth visit Chet was given the honor of ringing the bell on March 1, 2015. Chet and JoAnn loved to travel. They enjoyed making memories by traveling to many exotic destinations with son, Chuck, daughter-in-law, Melinda, and grandson, Cody.\n\nIt has been Chet’s greatest joy to watch his great-grandson, Charlie grow. He and Charlie had a “special” relationship “GG Chet” as he was called, was proud that he was able to witness the fourth generation of the initials CCS for the first-born son.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Chester and Irene, and sister, Barbara, Chet is survived by his wife, JoAnn, sons, Chuck (Melinda); Curt (Jill); grandsons, Cody (Marissa), John Snyder, Thomas Snyder; granddaughter, Hailey Hytrek (James) and a great-grandson, Charlie Snyder.\n\nThe family wants to thank the caregivers at The Madison Assisted Living facility, Advanced Hospice and a special caregiver, Paula for the loving care and attention given to Chet duringthis time.\n\nThe family would like to invite everyone following the services for a meal to gather at Chet’s grandson’s home for a time of fellowship and memory sharing.\n\nIn Lieu of flowers family would like memorial donations be made to SUSAN G KOMEN BREAST CANCER FOUNDATION or Advanced Hospice at 4700 Indian Creek Pkwy, Overland Park, KS 66207."
