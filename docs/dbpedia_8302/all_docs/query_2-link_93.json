Islands were named “Middlebrook Islands“.\n\n►August 28, 1867, Wednesday – Captain William Reynolds of the USS Lackawanna takes possession of the Island for the United States. Midway becomes the first offshore islands annexed by the U.S. government.\n\n►January 28, 1869, Thursday – The Navy adopts the name Midway Islands, according to a report submitted to the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs.\n\n►November 16, 1886, Tuesday – The schooner General Siegel was shipwrecked at Midway during a storm.\n\n►February 3, 1888, Friday – The British bark Wandering Minstrel was shipwrecked in Wells Harbor, during a storm.\n\n►January 17, 1899, Tuesday – The USS Bennington took possession of Wake Island, with the intention of having it used as a cable station between Midway and Guam. This idea was dropped when it was found there was no natural fresh water to sustain the cable station staff.\n\n►February 1899 – The project of a trans-Pacific cable has been much discussed recently, and President McKinley sounded the keynote for its construction in his message to Congress in February, 1899, in which he states that “Such communication should be established in such a way as to be wholly under the control of the United States, whether in time of peace or of war.” The construction of such a cable has been shown to be entirely practicable, and American manufacturers have shown themselves willing to undertake and guarantee the manufacture, laying, equipment, and operation of such a system of trans-Pacific cables.\n\nESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED COLONIAL TELEGRAPH SYSTEM. CABLES IN THE PACIFIC. Trans-Pacific cable, San Francisco, via Hawaiian Islands, Midway Island, and Island of Guam to Luzon $12,000,000 / Inter-Island communication for the Hawaiian Group 150,000\n\n*Special Note: The Restorer and her role. The Restorer’s duty was mainly to look after the Commercial Pacific Cable, laid in 1902-03. This ran San Francisco-Honolulu-Midway-Guam-Manila, P.I.. Adjacent cables were sometimes worked upon. The new cable needed little work in the early years. In about the first 10 years, Restorer’s log showed 114 days at sea, and 3,750 days at anchor in harbor, in drydock, or at dockside. The first CPCC Master was Capt. Basil Combe, who formally took command of C.S. Restorer on Jan 1, 1905. Capt. Combe had 20 years of cable work behind him, with destiny giving him almost 20 more, all on C.S. Restorer. This ship had many long-term crew members. Another one was Bill Pragnell who joined the ship in Singapore in 1904 as a cable splicer and was with the ship for many years. The next long term crew member added was Jack Robb, Chief Steward, who joined the ship in late March 1905, and who formerly was Purser on C.S. Scotia.\n\n►January 20, 1903, Tuesday – Due to recurring complaints of Japanese squatters and poachers, President Theodore Roosevelt places the island under the control of the Navy. Executive Order 199-A places Midway Islands “under the jurisdiction and control of the Navy Department.”\n\n►March 28, 1903, Saturday – Scheme uncovered by LCMDR Charles F. Pond by Japanese steamship company Toyo Kisen Kaisha (Oriental Steamship Company), to establish a signal station and signal operators on Midway as soon as cable communication is established there.\n\n►April 20, 1903, Monday – About 30 people from the Commercial Pacific Cable Company arrive on Midway to begin constructing the cable station. They first erect temporary houses and then construct five permanent station buildings using steel beam supports and reinforced concrete, which is considered an innovative use of the modern material. The buildings provide an office for the cable operator; a mess and recreation hall; and quarters for the staff, servants, and a superintendent. The basements are used for support functions, such as storing provisions and housing the laundry and machine shop.\n\n►April 22, 1903, Wednesday – Cable Operations Report. The departure from the Thames on 4/8/1903 of C.S. Anglia, and on 4/9/1902 of C.S.

USMC, arrive to secure Midway as a U.S. possession, protect the cable staff and albatross from Japanese bird poachers.\n\nThe USMC unofficially stated that the 4 year-tour was sent to “maintain order among unrulely Japanese employees of Pacific Cable Company.”\n\nA Brief History of the 10th Marines – 1\n\nA Brief History of the 10th Marines – 2\n\n►May 25, 1903, Monday – Will Midway make a Naval Base\n\n►June 3, 1903, Wednesday – U.S. Navy ejects Japanese poachers and squatters and appoints Commercial Pacific Cable Company as island custodians. The Japanese squatters and poachers were killing seabirds for feathers that were popular for women’s hats.\n\n►June 6, 1903, Saturday – GUAM to MIDWAY section: C.S. Colonia spliced on to the Guam shore end and commenced her lay to Midway carrying some 3183 miles of cable.\n\n►June 18, 1903, Thursday – The ships C.S. Anglia and C.S. Colonia complete installing the undersea telephone cable between Guam and Midway, having paid out 2992 miles and work commenced on laying the shore end. Considerable difficulty was met with owing to the shallow water which made the pull a very heavy task but with the help of Captain Rodman of the U. S. Survey ship Iroquois who lent thirty men the final splice was affected on 6/22/1903 making a total of 3000 miles paid out from Guam.\n\n►July 3, 1903, Friday – HONOLULU to MIDWAY section: Anglia anchored off Honolulu having expended some 1513 miles en route and by the next day had laid the shore end and spliced on. The cable was then handed over to Mr. Gaines at Honolulu for the official “round the world” messages. The total length of cable expended, including intermediate and shore ends was 1532 miles.\n\n►July 4, 1903, Saturday – The cable, which stretches from San Francisco to Honolulu to Midway to Guam to the Philippines, carries the first ‘around-the-world message’ and wishes “a happy Independence Day to the United States, its territories and properties.” The message takes 9 minutes to be received.\n\n►July 15, 1903, Wednesday – Cable Operations Report. Completion of the Midway-Honolulu Section on 4/7/1903 was reported, and that the whole of the line between San Francisco and the Philippines was expected to be opened for traffic on 7/20/1903, instead of the 15th, when the Tariff reductions recently announced for China, Hongkong, Japan, Philippines and by the Eastern and Great Northern routes would take effect. The Engineer’s Certificate of the satisfactory completion of the cable was submitted, and Authority was given for payment of the instalment of £50,000 due under the Contract.\n\n►July 25, 1903, Saturday – Undersea Cable open for traffic.\n\n►November 4, 1903, Wednesday – Cable Operations Report. A telegram reporting the loss of a schooner chartered to take provisions, etc. to Midway Island was reported, as was the dispatch of a Government Vessel with another supply of provisions, and to bring away shipwrecked crew.\n\nAdded note: A letter was read from Mr. G. G. Ward forwarding the soundings taken by U.S.S. Pathfinder, for the proposed Manila-Shanghai Cable. It was considered advisable for the CPCC to point out to the Government the necessity for more soundings in places where rapid alteration of levels are shown by present service. U.S.S. Pathfinder (1) was launched 7/12/1898, was powered by 4,500′ of canvas and a triple expansion steam engine of 1,173HP. This ship spent most of its life charting waters in and around the Philippines, until it was sunk by Japanese bombing in December of 1941.\n\n►May 1904 – About 20 U.S. Marines arrive to secure Midway as a U.S. possession and protect the cable staff and albatross from poachers.\n\n►July 4, 1904, Monday – Midway Island’s first baseball game played.

The game was called a draw after 9 innings, score 11 to 11…and yes, there were ladies present cheering on.\n\nAs an update – Since 1996, the USFWS has outlawed baseball on the island, claiming the game is not compatible with wildlife. The former Baseball Field has been demolished.\n\n►August 9, 1904, Tuesday – Life for the Marines of Midway Island – Honolulu Advertiser Article\n\n►December 8, 1904, Thursday – An Executive Order extended the jurisdiction of the Lighthouse Service to the noncontiguous territory of the Midway Islands. (Weiss, p. 18).\n\n►September 22, 1905, Friday – The U.S. Lighthouse Service illuminates the first lighthouse on Midway. Note: The Navy stationed a 20-man Marine unit there carrying out a number of projects including the building of a lighthouse on Sand Island and placed mooring buoys for docking ships. These Marine sentries marked the first time the United States garrisoned Midway with defensive intentions but it would not be the last.\n\nThe lighthouse soon was obscured by the quickly growing ironwood trees planted by the Cable Company personnel as a windbreak.\n\nWanted: any information about how long the Lighthouse operated before its removal.\n\n►May 13, 1906, Sunday – Dr. Miller, USN, died at 5:20am on Midway and was buried in an area now referred to as the ‘Doctor’s Cemetery‘. This was the first naval death recorded at Midway. Four of six individuals buried there were doctors.\n\n►1908 – Marine detachment was ordered away from Midway Island.\n\n►July 30, 1909, Friday – Dr. George Walter Hawkins died at Midway.

The Nov. 21, 1918, issue of the Seattle Times stated in a cable related article that only 7 Pacific cables out of 21, all neglected by war driven priorities, were in serviceable condition. The war years looked on the CPCC’s cable with a benevolent eye, but the early part of 1919 saw the ship off the southern climes catch up on years of neglect. Early in 1919 the Restorer was off to do repairs on the line near Midway, where they ran into another typhoon. The CPCC was so alarmed by the very serious weather reports from other ships in the area that they almost despaired of seeing the ship again. The tough ship did return though. In 1920 the ship was again off to Midway where more repairs were done. Mr. H. Butler, the Cable Superintendent at Midway, his wife, and their two small children, all marooned on Midway for an unbroken 4½ years, were on board Restorer when it headed for home. The Butlers then headed for a well-earned and happy six-month holiday in Ireland.\n\n►October 10, 1920, Sunday – The first aircraft to take flight from Midway. A U.S. Navy Curtiss N-9 seaplane, brought to Midway disassembled aboard the Eagle 40 (USN PE-40). Once there the seaplane was reassembled and conducted an aerial photographic mission to determine if Midway could be used as a base for transpacific flights. Because of the Washington Naval Treaty (1921-22), forbidding the fortifying of Midway, it wouldn’t be until 1938 that a seaplane base was established.\n\n►January 2, 1920, Friday – 1920 Federal Census Schedule / Hawaii Territory, Honolulu County, Midway Island Enumeration District 135 / pages 1A – 1B sheet 251 Enumerated by George H.

Both the Army and Coast Guard took part in the problem. The exercises were marred by a series of crashes, two from VP-6F resulting in 12 deaths, and numerous instances of aircraft being forced down by mechanical difficulties and sinking (no casualties). The tenders supporting the fleet were found to be so slow that they had to be sent ahead of the main body so as not to delay the exercises.

The very second China Clipper service from San Francisco carried a reporter and engineer from the US radio network The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on a mission to test recently developed shortwave radio equipment for long-distance reception. William Burke Miller and Harold See made several SW broadcasts from aboard the ‘Philippine Clipper’ as it flew on the 58-hour journey from San Francisco to Manila. These included interviews with PAA flight personnel, staff at Midway and Wake, and their own descriptions of the flight as it made its way westwards.

While Mr. Kurusu quietly strolled the island noting the US military build-up and defenses.\n\nChina Clipper depart Midway (8:39 am) Wednesday, 13 November 1941, for Honolulu, Hawaii, then onto Washington, DC.\n\nExactly 4 weeks later, negotiations breakdown, and Japanese forces simutaneously attack Pearl Harbor, Midway, Wake, Guam, Manila & Hong Kong, the “Bridge to the Pacific”\n\nhttps://www.criticalpast.com/…/65675046116_Japanese…\n\nBackstory: US’s dark secret during this time, President Roosevelt coordinate activities unknown to US “Isolationists”. The China Clipper and her sisters became central to Pacific diplomacy between 1936 and 1941. The U.S. Government used them to surveille Japanese positions in the Pacific, and they were often used by overt and covert operatives who needed to move quickly and discreetly between the Far East and the United States. Their air of intrigue was not just a Public Relations ploy; not for nothing was the route called the “Orient Express.”\n\n►November 26, 1941, Wednesday – The Japanese First Air Fleet leaves Japan’s Kurile Islands for Hawai’i. The fleet takes a route rarely used by merchant ships, and avoids radio transmissions to remain undetected.\n\n►November 27, 1941, Thursday – Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, sends “war warning” message to commanders of the Pacific and Asiatic Fleets. General George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, sends a similar message to his Hawaiian and Philippine Department commanders.\n\n►November 28, 1941, Friday – Carrier Enterprise (CV-6) sails for Wake Island in TF 8 (Vice Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr.) to ferry USMC F4Fs (VMF 211) to the atoll. Occasioned by the “war warning” of the previous day, the deployment is part of eleventh-hour augmentation of defenses at outlying Pacific bases. Halsey approves “Battle Order No. 1” (28 November) that declares that Enterprise is operating “under war conditions.” “Steady nerves and stout hearts,” the carrier’s captain concludes, “are needed now.” Supporting PBY operations will be carried out from advanced bases at Wake and Midway.\n\n►November 30, 1941, Sunday – Japanese Midway Neutralization Unit (Captain Kaname Konishi) consisting of destroyers Ushio and Sazanami sent to attack Midway, from Tokyo Bay.\n\n►December 1, 1941, Monday – Operation Z: Japanese Navy Destroyer Division 7 sailed from Tokyo, Japan sailed for Midway, soon to join the rest of the Midway Neutralization Unit.\n\n►December 2, 1941, Tuesday – Submarine Trout (SS-202) arrives off Midway Island on simulated war patrol.\n\n►December 3, 1941, Wednesday – Submarine Argonaut (SS-166) arrives off Midway Island on simulated war patrol.\n\n►December 5, 1941, Friday – Carrier Lexington (CV-2) in TF 12 (Rear Admiral John H. Newton) sails for Midway to ferry USMC SB2Us (VMSB 231) to that atoll. Like Enterprise (CV-6)’s deployment to Wake, Lexington’s to Midway is in response to the “War Warning” of 27 November.\n\nJapan assures the U.S. that her troop movements in French Indochina are only precautionary.\n\n►December 6, 1941, Saturday – In Washington D.C., U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt makes a final appeal to the Emperor of Japan for peace. There is no reply. Late this same day, the U.S. code-breaking service begins intercepting a 14-part Japanese message and deciphers the first 13 parts. The Americans believe a Japanese attack is imminent, most likely somewhere in Southeast Asia.\n\n►December 7, 1941, Sunday, 7:55am – ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR\n\nPearl Harbor is a U.S. naval base near Honolulu, Hawaii, that was the scene of a devastating surprise attack by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. Hundreds of Japanese fighter planes descended on the base, where they managed to destroy or damage nearly 20 American naval vessels, including eight battleships, and over 300 airplanes. More than 2,400 Americans died in the attack, including civilians, and another 1,000 people were wounded. The day after the assault, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan.\n\nUnarmed U.S. Army-chartered steam schooner Cynthia Olson is shelled and sunk by Japanese submarine I 26 about 1,000 miles northwest of Diamond Head, Honolulu, T.H., 33°42’N, 145°29’W. She is the first U.S. merchantman to be sunk by a Japanese submarine in World War II. There are no survivors from the 33-man crew or the two Army passengers.\n\nJapanese Type A midget submarine attempts to follow general stores issue ship Antares (AKS-3) into the entrance channel to Pearl Harbor; summoned to the scene by the auxiliary vessel, destroyer Ward (DD-139), on channel entrance patrol, with an assist from a PBY (VP 14), sinks the intruder with gunfire and depth charges. Word of the incident, however, works its way with almost glacial slowness up the chain of command.\n\nArmy radar station at Opana Point, Oahu, soon thereafter detects an unusually large “blip” approaching from the north, but the operator reporting the contact is told not to concern himself with the matter since a formation of USAAF B-17s is expected from the west coast of the United States. The army watch officer dismisses the report as “nothing unusual.” The “blip” is the first wave of the incoming enemy strike.\n\nConsequently, “like a thunderclap from a clear sky” Japanese carrier attack planes (in both torpedo and high-level bombing roles) and bombers, supported by fighters, totaling 353 planes from naval striking force (Vice Admiral Nagumo Chuichi) attack in two waves, targeting ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, and nearby military airfields and installations. Japanese planes torpedo and sink battleships Oklahoma (BB-37) and West Virginia (BB-48), and auxiliary (gunnery training/target ship) Utah (AG-16). On board Oklahoma, Ensign Francis G. Flaherty, USNR, and Seaman First Class James R. Ward, as the ship is abandoned, hold flashlights to allow their shipmates to escape; on board West Virginia, her commanding officer, Captain Mervyn Bennion, directs his ship’s defense until struck down and mortally wounded by a fragment from a bomb that hits battleship Tennessee (BB-43) moored inboard; on board Utah, Austrian-born Chief Water Tender Peter Tomich remains at his post as the ship capsizes, securing the boilers and making sure his shipmates have escaped from the fireroom. Flaherty, Ward, Bennion, Tomich and Bennion’s falling in action sets in motion a chain of events that will result in Mess Attendant First Class Doris Miller becoming the first African American to be awarded the Navy Cross. Miller, a brawny, broad-shouldered former high school football player, is recruited to carry the mortally wounded captain from the bridge. Their egress temporarily blocked by fires; however, the men are compelled to remain on the bridge. Miller mans a .50-caliber machine gun and later tells interviewers modestly that he believes he may have damaged two low-flying Japanese planes. Sadly, Miller will not survive the war; he will perish with escort carrier Liscome Bay (CVE-56) on 24 November 1943 off the Gilberts.\n\nJapanese bombs also sink battleship Arizona (BB-39); the cataclysmic explosion of her forward magazine causes heavy casualties, among them Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Commander Battleship Division 1, who thus becomes the first U.S. Navy flag officer to die in combat in World War II. Both he and Arizona’s commanding officer, Captain Franklin van Valkenburgh, are awarded Medals of Honor, posthumously. In addition, the ship’s senior surviving officer on board, Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, directs efforts to fight the raging fires and sees to the evacuation of casualties from the ship; he ultimately directs the abandonment of the doomed battleship and leaves in the last boat. He was awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nWhen Arizona explodes, she is moored inboard the repair ship Vestal (AR-4); the blast causes damage to the repair ship, which has already been hit by a bomb. Vestal’s captain, Commander Cassin Young earns the Medal of Honor by swimming back to his ship after being blown overboard by the explosion of Arizona’s magazines and directing her beaching on Aiea shoal to prevent further damage in the fires consuming Arizona.\n\nBattleship California (BB-44) is hit by both bombs and torpedoes and sinks at her berth alongside Ford Island; during the battle, Ensign Herbert C. Jones, USNR, organizes and leads a party to provide ammunition to the ship’s 5-inch antiaircraft battery; he is mortally wounded by a bomb explosion. Gunner Jackson C. Pharris, leading an ordnance repair party, is stunned by concussion of a torpedo explosion early in the action but recovers to set up an ammunition supply train, by hand; he later enters flooding compartments to save shipmates. Chief Radioman Thomas J. Reeves assists in maintaining an ammunition supply party until overcomes by smoke inhalation and fires; Machinist’s Mate Robert R. Scott, although his station at an air compressor is flooding, remains at his post, declaring “This is my station, and I will stay and give them [the antiaircraft gun crews] air as long as the guns are going.” Jones, Pharris, Reeves and Scott all receive the Medal of Honor (Jones, Reeves and Scott posthumously).\n\nJapanese bombs damage destroyers Cassin (DD-372) and Downes (DD-375), which are lying immobile in Drydock No. 1.\n\nMinelayer Oglala (CM-4) is damaged by concussion from torpedo exploding in light cruiser Helena (CL-50) moored alongside and capsizes at her berth; harbor tug Sotoyomo (YT-9) is sunk in floating drydock YFD-2. Contrary to some secondary accounts, Utah (a converted battleship) is not attacked because she resembled an aircraft carrier, she is attacked because, in the excitement of the moment, she looked sufficiently like the capital ship she once had been. Of the other sunken ships, California, West Virginia, Oglala, and Sotoyomo are raised and repaired; Cassin and Downes are rebuilt around their surviving machinery; all are returned to service. Oklahoma, although raised after monumental effort, is never repaired, and ultimately sinks while under tow to the west coast to be broken up for scrap. The hulks of Arizona and Utah remain at Pearl as memorials.\n\nBattleship Nevada (BB-36), the only capital ship to get underway during the attack, is damaged by bombs and a torpedo before she is beached. Two of her men are later awarded the Medal of Honor: Machinist Donald K. Ross for his service in the forward and after dynamo rooms and Chief Boatswain Edwin J. Hill (posthumously) for his work in enabling the ship to get underway and, later, in attempting to release the anchors during the attempt to beach the ship.\n\nBattleships Pennsylvania (BB-38), Tennessee (BB-43), and Maryland (BB-46), light cruiser Honolulu (CL-48), and floating drydock YFD-2 are damaged by bombs; light cruisers Raleigh (CL-7) and Helena (CL-50) are damaged by torpedoes; destroyer Shaw (DD-373), by bombs, in floating drydock YFD-2; heavy cruiser New Orleans (CA-32), destroyers Helm (DD-388) and Hull (DD-350), destroyer tender Dobbin (AD-3), repair ship Rigel (AR-11), and seaplane tender Tangier (AV-8), are damaged by near-misses of bombs; seaplane tender Curtiss (AV-4) is damaged by crashing carrier bomber; garbage lighter YG-17 (alongside Nevada at the outset) is damaged by strafing and/or concussion of bombs.\n\nDestroyer Monaghan (DD-354) rams, depth-charges, and sinks Type A midget submarine inside Pearl Harbor proper, during the attack. This particular Type A may have been the one whose periscope harbor tug YT-153 attempts to ram early in the attack.\n\nLight minelayer Gamble (DM-15) mistakenly fires upon submarine Thresher (SS-200) off Oahu, 21°15’N, 159°01’W.\n\nThresher mistakes Gamble for destroyer Litchfield (DD-336) (the latter ship assigned to work with submarines in the Hawaiian operating area), the ship with which she is to rendezvous. Gamble, converted from a flush-deck, four-pipe destroyer, resembles Litchfield. Sadly, the delay occasioned by the mistaken identity proves fatal to a seriously injured sailor on board the submarine, who dies four hours before the boat finally reaches port on the 8th, of multiple injuries suffered on 6 December 1941 when heavy seas wash him against the signal deck rail.\n\nCarrier Enterprise (CV-6) Air Group (CEAG, VB 6 and VS 6) search flight (Commander Howard L. Young, CEAG), in two-plane sections of SBDs, begins arriving off Oahu as the Japanese attack unfolds; some SBDs meet their doom at the hands of Japanese planes; one (VS 6) is shot down by friendly fire. Another SBD ends up on Kauai where its radio-gunner is drafted into the local Army defense force with his single .30-caliber machine gun. Almost all of the surviving planes, together with what observation and scouting planes from battleship (VO) and cruiser (VCS) detachments, as well as flying boats (VP) and utility aircraft (VJ) that survive the attack, take part in the desperate, hastily organized searches flown out of Ford Island to look for the Japanese carriers whence the surprise attack had come.\n\nNavy Yard and Naval Station, Pearl Harbor; Naval Air Stations at Ford Island and Kaneohe Bay; Ewa Mooring Mast Field (Marine Corps air facility); Army airfields at Hickam, Wheeler, and Bellows; and Schofield Barracks suffer varying degrees of bomb and fragment damage. Japanese bombs and strafing destroy 188 Navy, Marine Corps, and USAAF planes. At NAS Kaneohe Bay, Aviation Chief Ordnance man John W. Finn mounts a machine gun on an instruction stand and returns the fire of strafing planes although wounded many times. Although ordered to leave his post to have his wounds treated, he returns to the squadron areas where, although in great pain, he oversees the rearming of returning PBYs. For his heroism, Finn is awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nCasualties amount to: killed or missing; Navy, 2,008; Marine Corps, 109; Army, 218; Civilian, 68; Wounded: Navy, 710; Marine Corps, 69; Army, 364; Civilian, 35. One particular family tragedy prompts concern in the Bureau of Navigation (later Bureau of Naval Personnel) on the matter of brothers serving in the same ship, a common peacetime practice in the U.S. Navy. Firemen First Class Malcolm J. Barber and LeRoy K. Barber, and Fireman Second Class Randolph H. Barber, are all lost when battleship Oklahoma (BB-37) capsizes. The Bureau considers it in the “individual family interest that brothers are not put on the same ship in war time, as the loss of such a ship may result in the loss of two or more members of the family, which might be avoided if brothers are separated.” The Bureau, however, stops short of specifically forbidding the practice. On 3 February 1942, it issues instructions concerning the impracticality of authorizing transfers of men directly from recruit training to ships in which relatives are serving and urges that brothers then serving together be advised of the undesirability of their continuing to do so. Authorizing commanding officers to approve requests for transfers to facilitate separation, the Bureau directs in July 1942 that commanding officers of ships not forward requests for brothers to serve in the same ship or station. This is too late, however, to prevent the five Sullivan brothers from serving in light cruiser Juneau (CL-52) (see 13 November 1942). Acts of heroism by sailors, marines, soldiers, and civilians (from telephone exchange operator to yard shop worker), in addition to those enumerated above, abound. Among the civilians who distinguish themselves this day is Tai Sing Loo, the yard photographer, who has a scheduled appointment to take a picture of the marine Main Gate guards. During the attack, he helps the marines of the Navy Yard fire department fight fires in dry dock number one and later, in the wake of the morning’s devastation, delivers food to famished leathernecks.\n\nJapanese losses amount to fewer than 100 men, 29 planes of various types and four Type A midget submarines. A fifth Type A washes ashore off Bellows Field and is recovered; its commander (Ensign Sakamaki Kazuo) is captured, becoming U.S. prisoner of war number one.\n\nJapanese Naval Aviation Pilot First Class Nishikaichi Shigenori, from the carrier Hiryu, crash-lands his Mitsubishi A6M2 Type 0 carrier fighter (ZERO) on the island of Niihau, T.H. He surrenders to the islanders who disarm him and confiscate his papers but, isolated as they are, know nothing of the attack on Pearl Harbor. “Peaceful and friendly,” Nishikaichi is not kept in custody but is allowed to roam the island unguarded (see 9, 12-14 December).\n\nFirst night recovery of planes in World War II by the U.S. Navy occurs when Enterprise turns on searchlights to aid returning SBDs (VB 6 and VS 6) and TBDs (VT 6) that had been launched at dusk in an attempt to find Japanese ships reported off Oahu. Friendly fire, however, downs four of Enterprise’s six F4Fs (VF 6) (the strike group escort) that are directed to land at Ford Island. Other Enterprise SBDs make a night landing at Kaneohe Bay, miraculously avoiding automobiles and construction equipment parked on the ramp to prevent just such an occurrence.\n\nDamage to the battle line proves extensive, but carriers Enterprise and Lexington (CV-2) are, providentially, not in port, having been deployed at the eleventh hour to reinforce advanced bases at Wake and Midway. Saratoga (CV-3) is at San Diego on this day, preparing to return to Oahu. The carriers will prove crucial in the coming months (see Chapter VI, February-May 1942). Convinced that he has proved fortunate to have suffered as trifling losses as he has, Vice Admiral Nagumo opts to set course for home, thus inadvertently sparing fuel tank farms, ship repair facilities, and the submarine base that will prove invaluable to support the U.S. Pacific Fleet as it rebuilds in the wake of the Pearl Harbor disaster.\n\n►December 7, 1941, Sunday – About 9 a.m. Washington D.C. time, U.S. officials decode the last part of the Japanese message, stating that diplomatic relations with the U.S. are to be broken off. About an hour later, another Japanese message is intercepted. It instructs the Japanese embassy to break off talks with the U.S. at 1 p.m. Washington time. The U.S. War Department then sends out an alert to Hawaii military officials. Technical delays prevent the alert from arriving until noon Hawaii time, four hours after the attack has already begun. Almost at the same time, Japanese warplanes strike the Philippines and two U.S. islands: Wake and Guam, which are later occupied. The Japanese also invade Thailand and Malaya. Later that month, Japanese troops invade Burma and Hong Kong.\n\n► December 7, 1941, Sunday, 6:30 am – World War II began for Midway. A Marine Garrison received word of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. At 6:42 p.m. A Marine Sentry sighted a flashing light out at sea and alerted the garrison. Three hours later, the Japanese destroyers Sazanami and Ushio opened fire, damaging the newly built seaplane hangar on Sand Island. The roof burst into flames but the steel superstructure remained usable. Happily, everyone inside managed to escape. The only casualty was destroying a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that remained inside the hangar and knocking out the Pan American direction finder. By freak mischance, a 4.7-inch round went through a ventilation port in the power and communications building which was considered bomb proof. It was made of reinforced concrete 3-6 feet thick with four generators and two boilers on the first floor. The second floor housed the Command Center where Marine Corps First Lieutenant George Cannon had a machine gun command post and telephone switchboard on the concussion deck between two roofs. The Japanese retired at 10 p.m., leaving four Midway defenders dead and 10 wounded.\n\n►December 7, 1941, Sunday – Midway Island was bombarded by the “Midway Neutralization Unit,” a Japanese raiding force of (estimated) two cruisers and two destroyers. Return fire, from defense batteries, struck the Japanese’s ships and forced retirement under a smoke screen. Some damage to facilities on Midway Island was sustained and the following were killed by the Japanese’s bombardment: 1st. Lt. George H. Cannon, USMC Ens. Donald J. Kraker, USNR Pfc. Elmer R. Morrell, USMC F 2/C Ralph E. Tuttle, USN 1st. Lt. George H. Cannon, USMC, became the war’s first Marine Corps recipient of the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Midway seaplane hangar and the hospital were hit and burned. The hospital burned completely, the seaplane hangar was badly damaged. Reinforcements for Midway were rushed from Hawaii.\n\nThe Midway Neutralization Unit (Captain Kaname Konishi) consisting of destroyers Ushio and Sazanami; Marine shore batteries (6th Defense Battalion) return the fire, claiming damage to both ships. One of the submarines deployed on simulated war patrols off Midway, Trout (SS-202), makes no contact with the enemy ships; the other, Argonaut (SS-166), is unable to make a successful approach, and Ushio and Sazanami retire from the area. Subsequent bad weather will save Midway from a pounding by planes from the Pearl Harbor Attack Force as it returns to Japanese waters.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: Japanese declaration of war [N.B.: the so-called “Fourteen Point message” is not a declaration of war; it merely declares an impasse in the ongoing diplomatic negotiations. The Imperial Rescript declaring a state of war between the Japanese Empire and the United States is not issued until the next day, in Tokyo. pwc] reaches Washington, D.C., after word of the attack on Pearl Harbor has already been received in the nation’s capital.\n\n►December 8, 1941, Monday – The United States Congress declared war (Pub.L. 77–328, 55 Stat. 795) on the Empire of Japan in response to that country’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and declaration of war the prior day. The Joint Resolution Declaring that a state of war exists between the Imperial Government of Japan and the Government and the people of the United States and making provisions to prosecute the same was formulated an hour after the Infamy Speech of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Following the U.S. declaration, Japan’s allies, Germany, and Italy, declared war on the United States, bringing the United States fully into World War II.\n\n►December 8, 1941, Monday – Pan Am Clipper operations at Midway ended.\n\n►December 8, 1941, Monday – Cable connection from Midway to the Philippines closed and did not reopen until the war was over.\n\n►December 11, 1941, Thursday – United States declares war on Germany and Italy.\n\n►December 17, 1941, Wednesday – Small reconnaissance seaplane from Japanese submarine I 7 reconnoiters Pearl Harbor.\n\nUSMC SB2Us (VMSB 231), led by a plane-guarding PBY (VP 21) (no ships are available to plane-guard the flight), arrive at Midway, completing the longest over-water massed flight (1,137 miles) by single-engine aircraft. The squadron had been embarked in Lexington (CV-2) when the outbreak of war cancelled the projected ferry mission on 7 December 1941.\n\n►December 18, 1941, Thursday – President Roosevelt signs Executive Order No. 8984 that provides that Commander in Chief U.S. Fleet will take supreme command of the operating forces of all Navy fleets and coastal frontier commands, and be directly responsible to the President. Congress passes First War Powers Act.\n\n►December 22, 1941 – After a failed first attempt to invade Wake Island, December 11, 1941. The Imperial Japanese Navy launches a second invasion against the valiant US marine garrison of Wake Island. Launching planes from its carriers Soryu and Hiryu, and supported by numerous bombers and surface ships, they successfully overwhelmed island defenses and captured the island. Many of the captured will be sent to prison camps in Asia, while about 350 of 1150 civilians, mostly workers contracted by the Morrison-Knudsen Company, were enslaved to rebuild island defenses. Of the 433 marines, only one marine successfully escaped capture Lieut. Col. Walter Bayler.\n\nAs for the two Japanese carriers, their fate will be realized June 4 & 5, 1942, while attempting to invade Midway and destroy what was left of the US Carriers in the Pacific.\n\n►December 24, 1941, Wednesday – Seaplane tender Wright (AV-1) disembarks Marine reinforcements (Batteries “A” and “C,” 4th Defense Battalion) at Midway.\n\n►December 25, 1941, Thursday – Carrier Saratoga (CV-3) diverted from the attempt to relieve Wake Island, flies off USMC F2As (VMF 221) to Midway. These will be the first fighter aircraft based there.\n\n►December 26, 1941, Friday – Seaplane tender Tangier (AV-8), diverted from the attempt to relieve Wake Island, disembarks Battery “B,” 4th Defense Battalion and ground echelon of VMF 221 at Midway to augment that garrison’s defenses.\n\n►December 31, 1941, Wednesday – Admiral Chester W. Nimitz assumes command of Pacific Fleet in ceremonies on board submarine Grayling (SS-209) at Pearl Harbor.\n\nJapanese submarines shell Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii.\n\nIn 1942, While attending Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA, Madeline Codina Huebner was recruited into a cryptology class with the promise of three college credits and a position in the Naval Reserves. After passing the course, she took the fast-track 60-day training course to become an ensign in the Reserves. She and other WAVES “kept odd hours in closed rooms and were told not to discuss our work with others.”\n\n►1942 – While attending Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA, Madeline Codina Huebner was recruited into a cryptology class with the promise of three college credits and a position in the Naval Reserves. After passing the course, she took the fast-track 60-day training course to become an ensign in the Reserves. She and other WAVES “kept odd hours in closed rooms and were told not to discuss our work with others.”\n\nHer unit received a commendation for breaking a Japanese communications code before the Battle of Midway, which allowed the U.S. Navy to ambush the Japanese Navy. She achieved the rank of Lt. Commander. Madeline passed away in December of 2011 and is interred at the Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n►January 21, 1942 until February 8, 1942 – Offshore Japanese submarine I-69 reconnoiters and patrols the Midway Island area.\n\n►January 25, 1942, Sunday – Japanese submarine I-73 shells Midway Island, causing little damage and no loss of life.\n\n►January 27, 1942, Tuesday – Submarine Gudgeon (SS-211) torpedoes and sinks Japanese submarine I-73, 240 miles west of Midway, 28°24’N, 178°35’E.\n\n►February 8, 1942, Sunday – Japanese submarine I-69, which has been reconnoitering the atoll since 21 January, shells Midway.\n\n►February 10, 1942, Tuesday – Japanese submarine I-69 shells Midway but is immediately bombed and damaged by USMC F2As (VMF 221).\n\n►March 1942 – March, Japanese plane reporting weather conditions near Midway, mentioned “AF,” suggesting strongly that the designator referred to Midway.\n\n►March 10, 1942, Tuesday – As part of a second K-Operation, H6K Mavis, piloted by Lieutenant Hashizume while attempting to photograph Midway Island over the target, shot down by a USMC F2A Buffalo.\n\n►March 10, 1942, Tuesday – USMC F2As (VMF 221) from Midway shoot down Japanese reconnaissance flying boat (Yokosuka Kokutai) attempting to reconnoiter the atoll.\n\n►April 1942 — Led by Lieutenant Commander Joseph Rochefort, the team of cryptanalysts and linguists made up the U.S. Navy’s Combat Intelligence Unit (better known as Station Hypo), had gotten so good at breaking Japan’s main operational code, which they dubbed JN-25b, that they were able to intercept, decrypt and translate parts of Japan’s radio messages within hours of when they were sent. / Unable to convince his superiors or Washington, his findings or mounting concerns were side-stepped and communicated directly to Admiral Nimitz.\n\n►April 7, 1942, Tuesday – The cable connecting Midway and Guam was severed to prevent any “subversive communication” as Japan gained strength in the Pacific.\n\n►April 18, 1942, Saturday – “The Doolittle Raid”, also known as the Tokyo Raid, was an air raid on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Honshu. It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. Although the raid caused comparatively minor damage, it demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attacks. It served as retaliation for the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned by, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle (later a Lieutenant General in the US Army Air Forces and the US Air Force Reserve). Under the final plan, 16 B-25B Mitchell medium bombers, each with a crew of five, were launched from the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Hornet, in the Pacific Ocean, off Japan. There were no fighter escorts. After bombing the military and industrial targets, the crews were to continue westward to land in China. On the ground the raid killed about 50 people and injured 400. Damage to Japanese military and industrial targets was slight, but the raid had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised fear and doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution – this was exploited for propaganda purposes. The raid also pushed forward Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto’s plans to attack Midway Island in the Central Pacific – an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the US Navy in the Battle of Midway. The consequences of the Doolittle Raid were most severely felt in China, where Japanese reprisals caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers. Of the 16 USAAF crews involved, 14 complete crews of five returned to the United States or to US forces elsewhere – one crew was killed in action. Eight US aviators were captured by Japanese forces in Eastern China and three of these were later executed. All but one of the B-25s were destroyed in crashes, while the 16th landed at Vladivostok, in the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union was not officially at war with Japan, it was required, under international law, to intern the crew during the war, and their B-25 was confiscated. However, within a year, the crew was secretly allowed to leave the Soviet Union, under the guise of an escape – they returned to the United States, or to US units elsewhere, by way of Allied-occupied Iran and North Africa.\n\n►May, 1942 — IJN radio traffic, intercepted suggested that Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the mastermind behind the Pearl Harbor attack, was preparing a major invasion, involving four Japanese aircraft carriers along with many other ships, at a location designated with the initials “AF.”\n\n►May 1, 1942, Friday – Chester Nimitz departed Pearl Harbor, US Territory of Hawaii and later in the day arrived at Midway Island.\n\n►May 2, 1942, Saturday – Admiral Chester W. Nimitz visits Midway to informally inspect defenses and present decorations. He will leave the following day.\n\n►May 3,1942, Sunday – Chester Nimitz departed Midway Atoll and returned to Pearl Harbor, US Territory of Hawaii, with the direct order to give anything available to beef up Midway’s defenses.\n\n►May 3, 1942, Sunday – Light cruiser Nashville (CL-43) departs Pearl Harbor under orders to fuel at Midway and then proceed on a foray into the Japanese fishing grounds off the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Her raiding cruise to Kamchatka is postponed.\n\n►May – Mid-month, 1942 – Joe Rocheford and his team discuss how to validate “AF” as Midway. During this time Jasper Holmes’ familairity with Midway’s freshwater resupply and processing/desalination system, suggests to Rocheford sending a fake message via underwater cable to Midway, instructing personnel there to radio Pearl Harbor that the salt-water evaporators on the base had broken down.”\n\n►May 19, 1942, Tuesday – Light cruiser Nashville (CL-43) sails independently from Midway, bound for the western Aleutians.\n\n►May 20, 1942, Wednesday – the trap is set.\n\n►May 21, 1942, Thursday – Two weeks before the Battle of Midway found the defenders of Midway – 3,632 strong – had just two weeks to prepare for the invasion (Admiral Nimtz knew was coming). Some 120 planes jammed Eastern Island, 11 PT boats moved into the lagoon, 1,500 booby traps were set up on the beaches, barbed wire enmeshed the islands, and sandbags were piled everywhere. The whole garrison went underground, with the Navy and Marine command posts in dugouts in the middle of Sand Island. Gun emplacements lined the beaches. Molotov cocktails, made from old whiskey bottles, were stockpiled. By the end of May, everything that could be done was done.\n\n►May 22, 1942, Friday – Response by the IJN was picked up by Melbourne station. A Japanese message was intercepted that reported “AF” was running out of fresh drinking water.\n\n►May 22, 1942, Friday – A sailor accidentally set off a demolition charge under Midway’s gasoline supply. The explosion destroyed 400,000 gallons of aviation fuel, and damaged the distribution system, forcing the defenders to refuel planes by hand from 55-gallon drums.\n\n►May 25, 1942, Monday – Light cruiser St. Louis (CL-49) arrives at Midway and disembarks Companies “C” and “D,” 2d Marine Raider Battalion, and 37-millimeter gun battery of the 3d Defense Battalion.\n\n►May 26, 1942, Tuesday – Aircraft ferry Kitty Hawk (AKV-1) arrives at Midway with reinforcements for MAG 22, as well as the 3-inch antiaircraft group (3d Defense Battalion) and a light tank platoon earmarked for a mobile reserve.\n\n►May 27 1942, Wednesday – Operation “MI” – The Invasion of Midway Island:\n\nHashirajima. In the afternoon, Vice Admiral (Admiral, posthumously) Nagumo Chuichi’s (former CO of YAMASHIRO) First Air Fleet Striking Force (“Kido Butai”) CarDiv 1’s AKAGI and KAGA and CarDiv 2’s HIRYU and SORYU departed the fleet anchorage.\n\n►May 28, 1942, Thursday – Japanese First Fleet, Main Body (Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku in battleship Yamato) allocated to the Midway operation sorties from home waters. The Second Fleet, Escort Force (Rear Admiral Tanaka Raizo), whose composition includes 15 transports, sails from Saipan; Second Fleet, Occupation Support force (Rear Admiral Kurita Takeo) sorties from Guam.\n\nTF 16 (Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance), formed around carriers Enterprise (CV-6) and Hornet (CV-8), departed Pearl Harbor to take up position northeast of Midway.\n\n►May 29, 1942, Friday – Hashirajima – The First Fleet’s Main Body consisting of BatDiv 1’s YAMATO, NAGATO and MUTSU departs with Supply Group No. 1’s oilers NARUTO and TOEI MARU and DesRon 3’s light cruiser SENDAI with nine destroyers. Seaplane/submarine tenders CHIYODA and NISSHIN and light carrier HOSHO are in the Main Body’s Special Force as reserve under the command of Captain (Vice Admiral, posthumously) Harada Kaku. The Main Body remains 300 miles behind Nagumo’s Striking Force.\n\nCHIYODA: carries eight Type A midget submarines (HA-28, HA-29, HA-31, HA-32, HA-33, HA-34 and two others), about 150 men of the 12th Construction Battalion and 16 crewmen. NISSHIN carries torpedo boats No. 4 and No. 5. The Midway Invasion plan calls for the midget submarines to be stationed at Kure Island about 56 miles WNW of Midway. Lt (j.g.) Otozaka Shoichi, a member of the second midget training course, leads the Kure Island midget submarine unit.\n\nThe plan calls for the midget submarines to be landed on Kure Island on the afternoon of 6 June 1942. If Kure Island is found to be fortified by the Americans, Captain Harada is to form a Rikusentai (Naval Landing Force) of CHIYODA’s crew to occupy the island. Kure Island is then to also operate as a seaplane base for use against Midway. Later in June, four additional midget submarines are to be landed on the island.\n\nSeaplane tender (destroyer) Ballard (AVD-10) arrives at Midway along with the eleven motor torpedo boats from Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron One (Lieutenant Clinton McKellar Jr.); the latter are assigned to local defense forces of Midway (Captain Cyril T. Simard).\n\n►May – Late in the month, 1942 – Admiral Nimitz communicates to Midway’s Commanding Officer that Midway will be given anything they require to prepare for an assault / predicted for June 2, 1942.\n\n►June, 1942 – A single B-17 piloted by Major George E. Gober. from the 5th Bomb Group (5th BG), 31st Bomb Squadron (31st BS) flies a solo reconnaissance of Wake Island and made two runs over the island before being intercepted by Japanese fighters and claimed four shot down and one probable during a 40 minute combat. Although slightly damage, this B-17 returned safely to land at Midway Air Field.\n\n3 LB-30s bomb installations on Wake during the night of 26/27 Jun and is staged through Midway.\n\n►June 2, 1942, Tuesday – TF 17 (Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher) and TF 16 (Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance) rendezvous about 350 miles northeast of Midway; Rear Admiral Fletcher is officer in tactical command of a force that consists of three carriers, seven heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, 16 destroyers, and two oilers. After fueling, the task force will detach the oilers and prepare for battle. As part of the pre-battle disposition, 25 fleet submarines (Rear Admiral Robert H. English) are deployed around Midway.\n\n►June 3, 1942, Wednesday – In the preliminaries for the Battle of Midway, Midway-based aircraft locate and attack Japanese transports in the Second Fleet Escort Force about 600 miles west of Midway Island. USAAF B-17s inflict no damage. Four PBYs set out to attack the approaching Occupation Force. Japanese forces bearing down on Midway are under the personal direction of Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, Commander in Chief Combined Fleet, who wears his flag in battleship Yamato.\n\nMEANWHILE: As part of the overall Midway plan, Japanese Second Strike Force (Rear Admiral Kakuta Kikuji) bombs Dutch Harbor, Alaska; planes from carriers Ryujo and Junyo carry out the attack. In an event whose importance only becomes clear later, one Mitsubishi A6M2 Type 0 carrier fighter from Ryujo’s air group, most likely damaged by antiaircraft fire over Dutch Harbor, makes an emergency landing on Akutan Island. The pilot, however, is fooled by the flat surface upon which he is landing; it turns out to be a bog and the Zero flips over, killing the pilot (see 10 July).\n\n►June 4-6, 1942 – Early on June 4, aircraft from four Japanese aircraft carriers, which had attacked Pearl Harbor 6 months earlier, attack and severely damage the base on Midway. After their initial attacks, the Japanese aircraft head back to their carriers to rearm and refuel, and while the aircraft are returning, the Japanese navy is surprised by U.S. naval forces in the area. Aircraft from the USS Enterprise, USS Hornet, and USS Yorktown attack the Japanese fleet. Three Japanese carriers are hit, set ablaze, and abandoned. A fourth Japanese carrier, the Hiryu, responds with two waves of attacks—both times bombing the USS Yorktown, leaving her severely damaged but still afloat. That afternoon, a USS Yorktown scout plane locates the Hiryu, and the USS Enterprise sends dive bombers to attack. The attack leaves the Hiryu burning and without the ability to launch aircraft. Over the next 2 days, the U.S. Navy forces the Japanese to abandon the battle and retreat to Japan. The Japanese lose approximately 4,800 men, four carriers, one cruiser, and hundreds of aircraft, while the United States loses about 307 men, one carrier, one destroyer, and over 100 aircraft. The Battle of Midway is considered the decisive battle of the war in the Pacific. After Midway, the Americans and their allies took the offensive in the Pacific arena.\n\n►June 4, 1942, Thursday –The Battle of Midway Begins\n\n0430, Nagumo launches a strike against Midway.\n\n1025, as carriers AKAGI, KAGA and SORYU are preparing to launch strike against American carriers, they are attacked by “Dauntless” SBD dive-bombers from USS ENTERPRISE (CV-6) and YORKTOWN (CV-5) and all are set afire.\n\n1035, HIRYU is attacked unsuccessfully by Douglas TBD “Devastator” torpedo bombers of VT-3 from YORKTOWN.\n\n1054 and 1245, HIRYU launches strikes that heavily damage YORKTOWN.\n\n1703, while preparing to launch yet another strike, HIRYU suffers hits by four SBDs from ENTERPRISE and YORKTOWN and is set afire.\n\n1916, SORYU sinks by the stern followed at 1925 by KAGA that also sinks stern first.\n\n►June 5, 1942, Friday – Battle of Midway continues as TF 16 (Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance) pursues Japanese fleet, now without its central core of carriers, westward, while efforts proceed to try and salvage the crippled carrier Yorktown (CV-5). Motor torpedo boats from Midway fail to locate “burning Japanese carrier” located by Midway-based planes.\n\nJapanese carrier Akagi, damaged on 4 June, is scuttled by destroyers Nowaki, Arashi, and Hagikaze, 30°30’N, 179°08’W; carrier Hiryu, likewise damaged on 4 June, is scuttled by destroyers Kazegumo and Yugumo, 31°38’N, 178°51’W. Heavy cruisers Mogami and Mikuma are damaged in collision while turning to avoid shadowing submarine Tambor (SS-198), while retiring from Midway (see 6 June).\n\n0255, the C-in-C, Combined Fleet, Admiral (Fleet Admiral, posthumously) Yamamoto Isoroku (former CO of AKAGI) sends a signal from flagship YAMATO that cancels the invasion of Midway. Captain Harada receives the signal and orders CHIYODA, NISSHIN and HOSHO to set course westward.\n\n0510, HIRYU is scuttled by an IJN destroyer.\n\n0520, the burning hulk of AKAGI is scuttled by torpedoes from IJN destroyers and sinks bow first. The Main Body joins up with the remnants of the retiring Striking Force. MUTSU takes aboard about one-half of the survivors from AKAGI, KAGA, SORYU and HIRYU picked up earlier by DesRon 10’s destroyers.\n\n►June 6, 1942, Saturday – Battle of Midway concludes as planes from carriers Enterprise (CV-6) and Hornet (CV-8) attack retiring Japanese force. SBDs bomb and sink heavy cruiser Mikuma (30°00’N, 173°00’E); near-misses damage destroyers Asashio and Arashio. At Admiral Spruance’s expressed orders (because of the destruction of three torpedo squadrons on 4 June), TBDs (VT 6) that accompany the strike do not attack because of the antiaircraft fire from the Japanese ships. After recovering planes, TF 16 changes course to eastward to refuel and breaks contact with the enemy.\n\nMeanwhile, Japanese submarine I-168 interrupts salvage operations on Yorktown (CV-5), which is under tow of the tug (ex-minesweeper) Vireo (AT-144) and screened by destroyers, torpedoing Yorktown and torpedoing and sinking destroyer Hammann (DD-412) while she lies alongside the carrier (30°36’N, 176°34’W). Screening destroyers depth-charge I-168, but the Japanese boat, although damaged, escapes destruction.\n\nThe Battle of Midway, one of the most decisive battles in naval history, marks the turning point of the Pacific War. In the wake of the battle, efforts to locate downed aviators persist over the ensuing days.\n\n0410, a lookout of Cdr Tanabe Yahachi’s I-168’s spots YORKTOWN 12 miles away. For nine hours, Tanabe skillfully makes his approach.\n\n1331, he fires five torpedoes. Two strike the already damaged YORKTOWN, but she still does not sink.\n\n►June 6, 1942, Saturday – Japanese Fleet Pounded Heavily by U.S. Forces –\n\nNewspaper Article\n\n►June 7, 1942, Sunday – LB-30 Liberator AL589 piloted by Major General Clarence L Tinker, Commanding Officer (C. O.) 7th Air Force is lost leading a mission from Midway for a predawn bombing mission against Wake.\n\n►June 7, 1942, Sunday – 0458, YORKTOWN rolls over to port and sinks in about 18,000 feet of water.\n\n►June 7, 1942, Sunday – The Battle of Midway Ends – One of the most decisive U.S. victories in its war against Japan—comes to an end. In the four-day sea and air battle, the outnumbered U.S. Pacific Fleet succeeded in destroying four Japanese aircraft carriers with the loss of only one of its own, the Yorktown, thus reversing the tide against the previously invincible Japanese navy.\n\nIn six months of offensives, the Japanese had triumphed in lands throughout the Pacific, including Malaysia, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and numerous island groups. The United States, however, was a growing threat, and Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sought to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet before it was large enough to outmatch his own. A thousand miles northwest of Honolulu, the strategic island of Midway became the focus of his scheme to smash U.S. resistance to Japan’s imperial designs. Yamamoto’s plan consisted of a feint toward Alaska followed by an invasion of Midway by a Japanese strike force. When the U.S. Pacific Fleet arrived at Midway to respond to the invasion, it would be destroyed by the superior Japanese fleet waiting unseen to the west. If successful, the plan would eliminate the U.S. Pacific Fleet and provide a forward outpost from which the Japanese could eliminate any future American threat in the Central Pacific.\n\nAt the Battle of Midway, Japan lost four carriers, a cruiser, and 292 aircraft, and suffered 2,500 casualties. The U.S. lost the Yorktown, the destroyer USS Hammann, 145 aircraft, and suffered 307 casualties. Japan’s losses hobbled its naval might–bringing Japanese and American sea power to approximate parity–and marked the turning point in the Pacific theater of World War II. In August 1942, the great U.S. counteroffensive began at Guadalcanal and did not cease until Japan’s surrender three years later.\n\n►June 8, 1942, Monday – Tug Vireo (AT-144) is damaged by grounding, Midway.\n\n►June 9, 1942, Tuesday – Submarine Trout (SS-202) picks up two survivors from sunken Japanese heavy cruiser Mikuma.\n\n►June 10, 1942, Wednesday – Carrier Saratoga (CV-3) in TF 11 (Rear Admiral Aubrey W.

It lies 1,200 miles NW of Honolulu and is the oldest and westernmost exposure of the Hawaiian Islands chain of volcanoes.\n\n[2] Author/historian Kimata Jiro notes the midget submarines’ mission was to attack any future US invasion force en route to Midway. Kimata adds the idea to use the midget submarines as a defensive weapon was a complete reversal from their original tactical purpose.\n\n[3] CHIYODA later delivers midget submarines HA-28, HA-29, HA-31, HA-32, HA-33 and HA-34 to Kiska, Aleutians.\n\n►June 19, 1942, Friday – The first Japanese combatants from the Battle of Midway to set foot on Midway Island. Although not quite the way they wanted.\n\nPictured here: Japanese prisoners of war under guard on Midway, following their rescue from an open lifeboat by USS Ballard (AVD-10), on June 19, 1942. They were survivors of the sunken aircraft IJN carrier Hiryu. After being held for a few days on Midway, they were sent on to Pearl Harbor on June 23, aboard USS Sirius (AK-15).\n\n►June 19, 1942, Friday – Seaplane tender (destroyer) Ballard (AVD-10), directed to the scene by a PBY (VP 11), rescues 35 survivors (one of whom dies shortly after rescue) from Japanese carrier Hiryu that had been scuttled by destroyers Kazegumo and Yugumo on 5 June. They had been members of the engineering department, left below for dead in the abandonment of the ship.\n\n►June 21, 1942, Sunday – PBY (VP 24) recovers two-man crew from Enterprise (CV-6) TBD (VT 6) 360 miles north of Midway.

The bombing is reported by a forest ranger.\n\n►September 29, 1942, Tuesday – Small reconnaissance seaplane from Japanese submarine I-25 drops incendiary bombs on a forest in southern coastal Oregon–the second and last time a Japanese aircraft will bomb the continental United States during World War II in an attempt to ignite forest fires.\n\n►October 31, 1942, Saturday – While en route to from French Frigate Shoals to Midway, district patrol craft YP-345 is lost without trace to unknown causes, about 80 miles northeast of Laysan Island.\n\n►December 22, 1942, Tuesday – At 4:30pm twenty-six B-24s from 307th Bombardment Group (307th BG) took off from Midway Airfield and climbed to 10,000′ for a night bombing mission against Wake Island. The bombers include B-24D “Bundles For Japan” 41-23969, B-24D “The Bad Penny” 41-23899 and B-24D “Flying Gator” 41-23898. After crossing the international dateline, the bombers arrived over the target on December 23, 1942 from midnight until 12:40am, the B-24s bombed one of nine targets from 4,000′ making a single bomb run. The B-24s were armed with five 500-pound general purpose bombs, with some fused with 1/10 second delay fuses for specific targets, the rest with instantaneous fuses. The Japanese appeared to be caught off guard and did not offer a coordinated defense, with anti-aircraft fire and search lights not beginning until the raid began and described as light and mostly from machine guns with some heavy anti-aircraft guns. Search lights did not seem to be coordinated with anti-aircraft fire and caught only a quarter of the formation in their beams. Four enemy aircraft were believed to be in the air but did not intercept. Afterwards, the formation climbed to 10,000′ and flew westward crossing the international dateline and arrived over Wake Island after midnight on December 23, 1942, with clear visibility. The B-24s bomb nine different targets between midnight until 12:40am. The defending Japanese seemed to be caught off guard and did not offer a coordinated defense and anti-aircraft fire and search lights did not commence until the raid began and were described as light and mostly from machine guns with some 20mm anti-aircraft fire and heavy anti-aircraft fire. Search lights did not seem to be coordinated with anti-aircraft fire and caught only a quarter of the formation in their beams. Four enemy aircraft were believed to be in the air but did not intercept. Returning, the formation climbed to 10,000′ and crossed the international dateline then returned to land at Midway Airfield on.\n\n►December 23, 1943, Thursday – Between 5:50 am to 7:30 am – None of the bombers sustained serious damage (aside from two with superficial damage) or injuries to crews. In total, this mission spanned over 4,300 nautical miles and reported in the press as a “Christmas Eve” raid.\n\n►January 1, 1943, Friday – Sand Island landing field, composing of three landing strips, was completed and ready for use.\n\n►May 15, 1943, Saturday – Seven B-24’s from Midway bomb Wake; 4 others abort and 7 others fail to find the target. 22 fighters intercept the formation; the B-24’s claim 4 shot down; 1 B-24 is lost.\n\n►May 15, 1943, Saturday – TRIDENT Conference begins, with President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and the Combined Chiefs of Staff meeting in Washington, D.C\n\n►May 27, 1943, Thursday – Submarine Runner (SS-275) departs Midway for her third war patrol.

She is never heard from again.\n\n►January 3, 1944, Monday – Submarine Scorpion (SS-278) departs Midway for her fourth war patrol. She will rendezvous with Herring (SS-233) on 5 January, but will never be seen again.\n\n►October 28, 1944, Saturday – The USS Albacore submarine made a fueling stop at Midway Atoll in the Pacific, then headed west and was never seen again. Ten days later, an underwater explosion occurred off Japan’s Hokkaido Island near a mine barrier. Those two events have long been thought related, but without physical evidence, there was no way to know for sure.\n\n*Update – May 25, 2022, Wednesday – A Japanese team led by Dr. Tamaki Ura of the University of Tokyo began a search for the wreck of Albacore off Hokkaidō in waters about 7 kilometers (3.8 nmi; 4.3 mi) east of Hakodate. During the day, the team’s sonar detected what appeared to be a submarine hull 50 meters (164 ft) in length on the seabed at a depth of 250 meters (820 ft). On 26 May 2022, the team used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to photograph the wreck, capturing an image of what appeared to be the bridge and periscope of a submarine. The team concluded that the wreck very likely was that of Albacore, based on its position and the shape of its hull. The team planned to conduct a more detailed survey of the wreck in August 2022. On 16 February 2023, the Naval History and Heritage Command confirmed the identity of the wreck as Albacore, based on documented modifications made to her prior to her last patrol. Eighty five men were lost on the Albacore. The news also adds a detail to Electric Boat’s wartime history and brings conclusion for the families of the 85 men lost.\n\n►January 8 – 21 February 21, 1944 – Chanticleer-class submarine rescue vessel MACAW (ASR-11) grounded at entrance to Midway channel, while attempting to rescue submarine USS Flier (SS-250) which had grounded on the coral reef. USS Clamp (ARS-33), arriving 24 January, placed a crew on board Macaw after Flier was freed from the reef. Three separate attempts were made to refloat Macaw and pull her off, all without success and sank. During the sinking her commanding officer, Paul Burton, and four crewmen died after abandoning ship. Later, crew from the USS Shackle (ARS-9) worked on the site through 9 September 1944. A total of 1,086 diving hours were spent salvaging equipment and materials and placing demolition charges. More than two and one-half tons of explosives were used.\n\n►January 16, 1944, Sunday – Submarine Flier (SS-250) runs aground and is damaged as she transits channel at Midway Island; submarine rescue vessel Macaw (ASR-11) becomes stranded as she attempts to assist the stranded fleet boat.\n\n►January 22, 1944, Saturday – At Midway, efforts to refloat submarine Flier (SS-250) succeed, and she is taken in tow by submarine rescue vessel Florikan (ASR-9); submarine rescue vessel Macaw (ASR-11), however, remains stranded.\n\n►January 30, 1944, Sunday – PB2Ys (VP 13, VP 102) from Midway Island carry out nocturnal bombing raid on Wake Island to neutralize Japanese airfield installations there that could threaten the imminent Marshalls operations. Motor torpedo boats Gyoraitei No.5 and Gyoraitei No.6 are sunk during the raid. The strike marks the first time that Coronados are used as bombers, and strikes are repeated on the nights of 4, 8, and 9 February.\n\n►February 4, 1944, Friday – To affect the neutralization of Wake during the Marshalls operation, two squadrons of Coronados from Midway made the second of four night bombing attacks on Wake, a 2,000-mile round trip.\n\n►February 8, 1944, Tuesday – To affect the neutralization of Wake during the Marshalls operation, two squadrons of Coronados from Midway made the third of four night bombing attacks on Wake, a 2,000-mile round trip.\n\n►February 9, 1944, Wednesday – To affect the neutralization of Wake during the Marshalls operation, two squadrons of Coronados from Midway made the fourth of four night bombing attacks on Wake, a 2,000-mile round trip.\n\n►February 12, 1944, Saturday – Submarine rescue vessel Macaw (ASR-11), stranded at entrance to Midway Channel since 16 January, slips off the reef and [begin to sink, going under following day].\n\n►February 21 – June 1944 – John Herschel Glenn Jr. (July 18, 1921 – December 8, 2016), was an American aviator in the United States Marine Corps, engineer, astronaut, businessman, and politician. He was the third American in space, and the first American to orbit the Earth, circling it three times in 1962. Following his retirement from NASA, he served from 1974 to 1999 as a Democratic United States Senator from Ohio; in 1998, he flew into space again at age 77.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, Glenn quit college to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He was not called to duty by the Army, and enlisted as a U.S. Navy aviation cadet in March 1942. Glenn attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City for pre-flight training and made his first solo flight in a military aircraft at Naval Air Station Olathe in Kansas, where he went for primary training. During advanced training at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, he accepted an offer to transfer to the U.S. Marine Corps. Having completed his flight training in March 1943, Glenn was commissioned as a second lieutenant. After advanced training at Camp Kearny, California, he was assigned to Marine Squadron VMJ-353, which flew R4D transport planes from there. The fighter squadron VMO-155 was also at Camp Kearny flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat. Glenn approached the squadron’s commander, Major J. P. Haines, who suggested that he could put in for a transfer. This was approved, and Glenn was posted to VMO-155 on July 2, 1943, two days before the squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station El Centro in California. The Wildcat was obsolete by this time, and VMO-155 re-equipped with the F4U Corsair in September 1943. He was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1943, and shipped out to Hawaii in January 1944.\n\nVMO-155 became part of the garrison on Midway Atoll on February 21 – June 1944.

Restorer left Honolulu for Midway, fighting a really vicious typhoon all the way. Being very young then, this writer involved some risk and took some spectacular pictures of the Restorer making like a destroyer in a grade B Hollywood patriotic type movie. There were times when the foredeck was under solid water. Later, in a very cautious venture to the stern railing, both propellers were seen completely out of the water, and then racing at which times the main engine governors locked. They had to be hammered to get them to release. When the stern came down very hard, the force of the propellers hitting the water would sometimes cause the engines to turn briefly in the opposite direction. The ship was both plunging and rolling very badly. Once, it rolled from 37 deg. on one side to 37 deg. on the other side. Due to the terrible pounding, some linkage in the steam powered steering gear broke, and the ship had to be steered by the big manual wheel in the stern until repairs were made. Both main engines broke down separately with bearing problems caused by the pounding they were taking. Some 800 miles away in the same typhoon, a wartime built T2 tanker broke up and sank, but Restorer eventually made it to Midway to do some cable work. While at Midway, Restorer was written up in two issues of The Midway Mirror – Sage of the Islands, a locally produced paper.\n\n►May 29, 1947, Thursday – The first child, in recorded history, graduated from Elementary School on Midway Island, her name was Nellie Leo Ganci.\n\nBefore leaving Midway, Restorer had to buy Bunker A Navy Fuel to replenish its tanks greatly diminished after fighting the typhoon.
