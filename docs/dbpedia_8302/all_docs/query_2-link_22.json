Her research focus was in the History of New England and Comparative Women’s History, with a focus on transatlantic social movements. During her time at UMass Amherst she diversified her understanding of public history practice and how museums can better serve their communities.\n\nAllison's Master's Thesis explored how historic houses can align with social justice issues and creative programming to inspire relevancy in their community. She used Casey Farm as an example of this endeavor and specifically discussed the relationship between the food movement and museums. During her time at UMass she participated in the Historic Deerfield Summer Fellowship Program, was a Digital Resource Management Intern at Historic New England, and worked as the Public History Assistant in the Department. She currently works at Mystic Seaport Museum as a Public Programs & Events Associate and is on the social media committee for the Dublin Seminar of New England Folklife.\n\nDevon King (MA, 2022) Preservation Planner at VHB (Watertown, MA)\n\nDevon received his undergraduate degree at UMass Amherst, where he wrote his senior thesis “Preserving History, Reviving Cities: The Heritage State Parks of Massachusetts,” surveying the Heritage State Parks system established by Massachusetts in the 1970s and 1980s. Following graduation, he completed a fellowship with the Newport Historical Society where he produced an essay published in the Society’s journal investigating the urban renewal projects which produced America’s Cup Avenue and Newport’s modern, historical downtown. Devon then worked for a year as an Architectural Historian at McGinley, Kalsow, and Associates, Inc., a preservation architecture firm located outside Boston.\n\nIn fall 2019, Devon returned to UMass to pursue his master’s degree and Public History certificate, with a focus on studying post-war built environment and cultural landscapes in New England. Supplementing his studies with a Historic Preservation Certificate from the Boston Architectural College, Devon gained both a technical understanding of the preservation field as well as a broadened understanding of the cultural, social, and economic forces that influenced the development of universities and major cities following World War II. While finishing his degree in the summer and fall of 2021, Devon worked with the National Park Service’s Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation where he oversaw the completion of vital landscape preservation planning documentation for Fairsted, the home and office of celebrated landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Sr. and the Olmsted Brothers design firm. Beginning in November 2021, Devon worked as a Associate Architectural Historian with the Public Archaeology Laboratory, Inc. in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\nIn November 2022, Devon accepted a role as a Preservation Planner at VHB in Watertown, Massachusetts.\n\nAlexa Harrington (MA, 2021) 5th Grade EIA/Social Studies Teacher, Greenfield Middle School and Museum Educator, Old Sturbridge Village\n\nAlexa recieved her B.A. from Franklin Pierce University.

She studied Digital Humanities, Public History, and American History at UMass Amherst. While at UMass, she participated in numerous projects including the Truth, Dissent, & The Legacy of Daniel Ellsberg Conference and archival project. She also was the Public History Assistant in the department. After graduation, Helen accepted a positition as a Publicity Assistant at UNC Press.\n\nTianna Darling (MA, 2021) Administrative Assistant, New England Air Museum (East Granby, CT)\n\nTianna received her undergraduate degree from Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts (MCLA) in North Adams, MA. During her time at MCLA, she majored in History and obtained minors in both Public History and Physics. She was introduced to the power of learning history outside a traditional classroom setting during an internship at Arrowhead, Herman Melville’s historic house in Pittsfield, MA. After graduation, she completed an internship and worked at Chesterwood, a National Trust for Historic Preservation site in Stockbridge, MA. During the year between receiving her undergraduate degree and beginning at UMass, she was hired at both the New England Air Museum as a Public Programs Facilitator and at Wistariahurst Museum as a member of the event staff. Both of these positions continued to foster her passion for the museum world and educating the public.\n\nThrough her studies at UMass, she has broadened her scope of public history interest. As part of the Intro to Public History class, she and two other students completed a white paper for the Springfield Armory National Historic Site in regards to their educational programming. She also interned at the New England Air Museum in addition to working on the Public Programs Team. There she recorded interviews of staff and volunteers to preserve the institutional history in the site’s 60th year. In her final two semesters she was thrilled to be a part of a class devoted to researching and writing about the life and work of Daniel Ellsberg, completing archive work that will eventually be turned into a catalog for the 50th anniversary of the release of the Pentagon Papers next year. Tianna is now an Administrative Assistant at the New England Air Museum.\n\nDanielle Raad (PhD 2021) Curator, Stanford Archaeology Collections (SUAC) and Assistant Director of Collections, Stanford Archaeology Center (Stanford, CA)\n\nDanielle graduated in 2021 with a Ph.D. in Anthropology and a Graduate Certificate in Public History. Her dissertation, titled \"Above the Oxbow: The Construction of Place on Mount Holyoke,\" is a contemporary archaeological ethnography of place-making on a mountain. Her book project based on her dissertation is under advance contract with West Virginia University Press. Danielle holds a B.Sc. in Chemistry from Brown University, an M.A. in Chemistry from Harvard University, an S.M. in Materials Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an M.Ed. in Secondary Education from Lesley University. She has years of teaching experience at both the high school and college levels.\n\nWhile at UMass, Danielle was an Academic Advisor at the Commonwealth Honors College, taught a course on Ancient Civilizations for several semesters, and completed two museum internships. During the summer of 2019, she was a Curatorial Intern at Historic Deerfield (Deerfield, MA), generously supported by a Dr. Charles K. Hyde Public History Intern Fellowship, and in 2020 she worked at the Education Department of the Slater Memorial Museum (Norwich, CT), supported by a Dr. Judith A. Barter Internship Fellowship.\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, Danielle began a postdoctoral fellowship in academic affairs and outreach in the Education Department of the Yale University Art Gallery. In this role, she expanded curricular engagement with the museum's collections, particularly that of STEM faculty and students. In August 2023, Danielle will become the Curator of the Stanford Archaeology Collections (SUAC) and Assistant Director of Collections at the Stanford Archaeology Center. In this role, she will lead all aspects of SUAC operations including acquisitions, collections management, exhibitions, education, research, and outreach.\n\nRachel Lima (MA, 2020) Grants Administrator, New York University\n\nGrowing up spending much time outdoors and interning in 2018 at Weir Farm National Historic Site in Connecticut impacted my research interests as a historian, which concern the preservation and interpretation of public lands that shape perceptions of culture and heritage. While a student at UMass Amherst I pursued public history with a focus on historic preservation, as well as obtaining the cultural landscape management certificate in the Land Architecture and Regional Planning department. In May 2020 I began my position as the Director of Youth and Family Programming for the Mattatuck Museum before transitioning to my current role as Grants Administrator for NYU.\n\nTaneil Ruffin (MA, 2020) PhD student, Princeton University (Princeton, NJ)\n\nTaneil's research explored the relationships between people's understanding(s) of the natural world and various social and political projects throughout the Americas during the long nineteenth century. She also pursued a certificate in Public History. During her time in the program, Taneil enjoyed several opportunities to further explore these interests through her work on projects for the Humanities Action Lab, the National Park Service, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. She also participated in the 2019 Mellon Scholars Summer Workshop at the Library Company of Philadelphia. In Fall 2020, she began the PhD program in history at the Princeton University.\n\nMatthew Smith (MA, 2020) Budget Coordinator for the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Brandeis University (Waltham, MA)\n\nDuring my undergraduate career, I completed the dual degree program for English and History at UMass while writing my undergraduate thesis focusing stories of peoplehood and their influence on national identity. I also studied archaeology extensively, which started my interest in public history. During my time in the UMass Public History program I researched monumental structures and the way they are used to manipulate collective memory, as well as how we interact with monumental structures and spaces which reflect values that are no longer socio-culturally viable.\n\nWhile completing my graduate studies, I worked full-time at with UMass Residential Life Student Services as a Residential Service Desk Coordinator. While not directly related to my studies, this position allowed me to gain skills in management, administration, and customer service that will be invaluable as I move forward with my career.\n\nMark Roblee (PhD, 2019) Lecturer, Commonwealth Honors College, UMass Amherst (Amherst, MA)\n\nAt UMass, I teach intellectual and cultural history informed by public history practice and perspectives. My research revolves around religion and philosophy in the ancient Mediterranean. I continue to wonder about the presentation of antiquity, \"numinous objects,\" and why people love old things. I'm always looking for new ways to share my enthusiasm for the humanities and explore human thought, experience, and creativity over time and place.\n\nI entered the UMass Public History Program with an interest in the intersection between public history practice and the \"presentation\" of antiquity in museums, popular culture, and heritage. In 2007, I worked on Mount Holyoke College Art Museum’s \"Excavating Egypt\" show and, in 2012, interned with the museum education director there during the \"Reconstructing Antiquity\" exhibition. Using the \"Reconstructing Antiquity\" collection, I produced a professional development workshop on teaching with objects for high school teachers of Ancient Greek and Roman civilization along with a guidebook for use in and out of the classroom. In 2012, I co-designed and mounted an exhibit on sericulture, “The Thread That Connects,” for Historic Deerfield. I co-facilitated two rounds of the Applied Humanities Learning Lab (Five College/Mellon), a public humanities intensive for Five College undergraduates. In 2017, I co-facilitated a workshop at the National Humanities Conference which took a group of professionals to the Boston Common and Public Garden to create \"pop-up\" Humanities \"happenings\" for/with the public. From 2019 - 2023, I coordinated Public Historians around Boston (PHaB), a professional networking group for alumni. These days I’m involved with the Amherst Historical Society and Museum, bringing in student interns to work on collections, exhibits, education, and outreach as well as independent research projects.\n\nJacob Boucher (MA 2019), Interpreter, Lowell National Historical Park (Lowell, MA)\n\nThroughout my undergraduate career I was always thinking about not just history, but how history itself is remembered – memory, memorial, museums, etc. When I got to graduate school UMass I found out it had a name – public history. My interests are varied, but my primary commitment has always been to finding ways to share and communicate what we as historians learn with whoever is willing to listen. Much of my experience in the field comes from Lowell National Historical Park, where I act as a seasonal interpretive ranger giving tours, staffing exhibits, and helping to design and implement new, special programming for the park. This is where I completed my internship during the program, producing a short video and two educational programs. It became clear that my interests aligned with Lowell’s, and so I chose to focus on nineteenth-century U.S. History and global environmental history, with a special focus on industrialization.\n\nThese various interests came to a head in an extensive research paper on the relationship between the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst) and the Sapporo Agricultural School in Hokkaido, Japan. I tracked the transnational diffusion of crops, and studied the methods these agriculturalists used to advise their Japanese students. I also reassessed how essential the advisors were to the school’s operation and questioned the Japanese government’s motivation for inviting certain members of the party. I hope in the future to continue this work, making the information more accessible to the public as well as reworking it into an article for scholarly review.\n\nI continue to work for Lowell National Historical Park on a seasonal basis, and hope to obtain a permanent or career seasonal position. I also continue to work on my video editing projects, and now work alongside Freedom’s Way National Heritage Area to make their Heritage Stories video series, highlighting the lives of historical figures who lived in the Heritage Area, especially suffragists and women’s rights activists.\n\nPerri Meldon (MA 2019), Ph.D. Candidate, Boston University's American and New England Studies Program (Boston, MA)\n\nAfter completing her M.A. and public history certificate at UMass Amherst, Perri began her doctoral studies at Boston University in 2019. Building on her background in public history and federal land management, Perri studies the history of mid-Atlantic U.S. wildlife refuges and their relationship to surrounding communities.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Perri will serve as a Park History fellow with the National Park Service, where she assists with disability history initiatives. This work is an outgrowth of the research she conducted at UMass, which examined the history of accessibility and disability representations in the National Park Service. Perri received a 2022 Excellence in Cultural Resources Award from the National Park Service Cultural Resources, Partnerships, and Science Directorate. You can learn more about this collaborative work at https://www.nps.gov/people/madison-grant.htm.\n\nSharon Mehrman, MA'19, Furniture Maker\n\nIn my pursuit of a Master’s of Design and a Graduate Certificate in Public History, my studies are focused on material culture, historic preservation, and wood science. I’m especially interested in the technology and design of early machines and tools, architecture, and building technologies. As a public historian, I’m interested in creating dynamic ways to engage visitors. I have over 25 years of experience utilizing Design Thinking modalities to create design solutions in furniture making, woodworking, interior design, and graphic design. I own and operate a one-woman workshop in Florence, Massachusetts, where I design and build heirloom quality furniture and home furnishings. My experience as an artisan of handcrafted furniture informs my research and scholarship in my graduate studies.\n\nPrimarily a self-taught woodworker, I earned a Master Furniture Maker certificate from Hill Institute in Florence Massachusetts in 2009, where I now teach woodworking and furniture making classes. In 2016, I was appointed the director of the Master Furniture Program. Through a progression of early American furniture pieces, I teach students handcraft techniques such as cutting mortise & tenon and dovetail joinery, carving decorative elements like shells and fans, and wood inlay and veneering. Since taking over as program director, I have added a component to engage students in learning decorative arts history in conjunction with their hands-on practicum. In 2015, I was awarded the Grand Prize in the Popular Woodworking Magazine Excellence Awards for the Thread Chest, an Art Nouveau inspired original design casework piece that I created for a private collector. I show my work in nationally recognized juried craft shows including Paradise City Arts Festival and CraftBoston. My work was juried into a six-month exhibition at the Connecticut Historical Society, featuring current works by members of the Society for American Period Furniture Makers in 2012.\n\nIn 2019, I brought my public history training and furniture skills together in a project for Historic Northampton, creating a three-quarter scale reproduction of an iconic \"Hadley\" chest for installation in the exhibition \"Making it on Main Street.\"\n\nKendall Taivalkoski, MA'19\n\nBorn and raised in Wisconsin, with half of my family “Yoopers”, I am a Midwestern woman who took myself east to pursue my education in history. I have a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point (UWSP) in History and it was there I developed my love for history and, more specifically, public history. The Stevens Point area, as well as my hometown, did not offer many opportunities to expand my knowledge of these fields so I applied to programs where I could. After a study abroad program led me to a short stay in Cuba (in January 2014), I participated in thae London internship program (Fall 2015) that placed me in a little hidden gem of London’s East End called The Ragged School Museum. It was there that I discovered my love for local history and the passion residents brought to it. Upon my return to the States I interned at the Milwaukee County Historic Society, cataloguing hundreds of objects. I also became an experimental intern at Amherst, Wisconsin’s coolest venture, The Taxidermy Store, and completed a research paper about the historic value of the town of Ahmeek, Michigan and the Keweenaw Peninsula.\n\nWhile at UMass I developed an interest around sports history and how it contributes to cultural and national identity, and how sports have been utilized as a form of soft power. During the summer of 2018 I interned at the Lake Placid Olympic Museum, where I was able to see first-hand how the Olympics helped build the Lake Placid’s identity as a winter sports town and how that legacy continues today. Back in the Pioneer Valley, I worked with the Volleyball Hall of Fame in Holyoke, MA, where that sort was invented. Being from Packer-land, I hope eventually to bring my studies in sports history back around to my home state as well as Upper Michigan.\n\nEmma Winter Zeig (MA, 2019), National September 11 Museum & Memorial (New York, NY)\n\nMy parents bought me my first textbook on Early American History when I was seven years old, and I've been hooked ever since. While getting my BA in History with a concentration in Colonial America, I found myself as interested in ways that history could be communicated to a larger audience as I was in the subjects I was studying. I took part in planning an oral history and lectures at my school, and spent a summer in an internship at the Smithsonian Institution Archives assisting in the documentation of their oral history project. One of the major forces in determining my professional path came from an internship and subsequent volunteer position that I held at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, where I participated in the research and planning of over 20 exhibits. My time at the NYPL allowed me to do research in my other research interest: the history of theater and film, while helping me discover that Public History was the path for me.\n\nAs a MA student, during an internship for the National Museum of American History, supported by a Charles K. Hyde Fellowship, I continued my work in the public history of American entertainment, contributing to the development of a 7000 square foot exhibition that will explore how public entertainment shapes and reflects larger themes in U.S. History. Another internship at Historic Northampton in Fall 2018 led to my current postion as Research and Education Coordinator, and I'm pleased to have played a significant role in the creation of educational activities to accompany the exhibition \"Making it on Main Street.\"\n\nLJ Woolcock-Srolovic (MA, 2019), Graduate Administrator, University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nMy work as a scholar has been eclectic. As an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh I trained as a medievalist, researching the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Baltic Crusades. My research examined how Christians in Western Europe incorporated their growing knowledge of paganism in Lithuania into their own worldview by relating it to classical antiquity, the subject of my 2014 journal article “Virgil in Lithuania: Francesco Petrarch’s Interactions with Paganism in the 14th Century.” I worked for the University's Special Collections department, igniting a passion for connecting people to the past using rare books and archives.\n\nMy graduate research focused on urban slavery in Charleston, South Carolina, in the 18th and 19th centuries, and specifically the experiences of enslaved women. I asked how we can imagine enslaved women's experiences of their enslavement by looking at the city's streets, buildings, and social landscape, and traced how slavery impacted the development of Charleston itself. Part of this work included a Twitter project, @HistOnTheGround, where I paired images from my archival research with urban exploration to show how cities have changed over time.\n\nI also continued my training as an archivist. In spring 2018 I interned at Mount Holyoke College’s Special Collections and Archives, and at the Massachusetts Historical Society in summer 2018, contributing to the Adams Papers documentary editing project and processing archival materials for their Collections Services department.\n\nAfter graduation I joined the staff of the Massachusetts Historical Society as a library assistant. In addition to providing remote and in-person reference services to researchers, I wrote the first subject guide to materials related to Indigenous History in the Society's Collections. I returned to Pittsburgh in 2022, and I now work as a Graduate Administrator for the English & Theatre Arts Departments at the University of Pittsburgh, guiding students through their graduate programs. Throughout my career as a historian my central passion has been creating community and connecting people to new resources and ideas, and that continues to be an integral part of my work.\n\nAmelia Zurcher (MA, 2019), Outreach & Events Coordinator, History Department, University of Wisconsin Madison (Madison, WI)\n\nI entered graduate school at UMass Amherst eager to become more familiar with the diverse work of a public historian and to further explore methods for challenging established narratives in local history. During my undergraduate years at The College of New Jersey I had researched the active political culture of Trenton’s Puerto Rican community in the late twentieth century and wrote a history honors thesis about seventeenth-century Newark, New Jersey. It traced the town’s transformation from one resembling its New England origins to one increasingly shaped by intensifying proprietary conflicts and relations with Lenape people. Through a Master’s Thesis entitled “Unsettling East Jersey: Borders of Violence in the Proprietary Era” I continued to question the unique political and social conflicts among both English and Native communities in seventeenth-century East Jersey. In many public history courses I studied how Euro-American and Lenape histories in the colonial Mid-Atlantic can be better presented through museums and digital history. During my time in the Public History program I worked on exhibits, catalogued collections, utilized digital platforms, developed public tours, and organized public events. Some of my favorite projects include a tour of the Old Manse attic for the Trustees that introduced often-forgotten inhabitants into the house’s historical narrative, a walking tour I developed about twentieth-century activism for the Cambridge Historical Society, and the various exhibits that I had assisted with at Historic Northampton.\n\nSince graduating from the UMass Amherst Public History program in 2019, I have worked for Essex Heritage, a non-profit organization in Salem, Massachusetts that promotes conservation and development of the Essex National Heritage Area. I first began at Essex Heritage leading historical walking tours and working in the National Park Service Regional Visitor Center. I am now assisting with a range of countywide programs. Most recently, I worked on the newly recreated Using Essex History website, which makes hundreds of local primary sources available online for teachers of Essex County. I hope to continue to create public programs that encourage exploration of local history by making historic sites and historical information accessible and relevant to present communities.\n\n​\n\nErica Fagen (PhD, 2019), Planning, Programming and Research Officer, Integrated Health and Social Services University Network (CIUSSS) for West-Central Montreal (Montreal, CA)\n\nI am a public historian with specializations in modern Europe, digital history, social media, and mass violence and genocide. I completed my Ph.D, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in May 2019. During my time at UMass Amherst, I presented at conferences such as the National Council for Public History's annual conference in 2014, 2015, and 2017 and participated in seminars such as the Trans-Atlantic Summer Institute's Reframing Mass Violence in Europe and the Americas: The Holocaust and Global Memory Constellations seminar in Bayreuth, Germany in 2016. I am currently writing a book with Professor Jennifer Evans (Carleton University) and Dr. Meghan Lundrigan entitled Holocaust Memory in the Digital Mediascape.\n\nMy training as a historian prepared me well for a career outside academia. I live in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and I currently work as a Planning, Programming and Research Officer in the Department of Professional Practice at the Integrated Health and Social Services University Network for West-Central Montreal. My work consists of integrating best practice research and policy to support allied health professionals (dietitians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, social workers, and others professionals) across a network of hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centers, residential centres, long-term geriatric residences, and day centres. I also have a busy volunteer life, and I am currently an Officer (Secretary) on the Board of Directors at the Jewish Public Library in Montreal. My training in research, writing, public speaking, and serving as the GHA co-chair for the 2014-2015 academic year provided me with great experience for my current roles in the fields of health care, government, libraries, and community activism.\n\nMy public history work has been diverse, including development of pedagogical tools at the Montreal Holocaust Museum, working on projects such as Hate 2.0: Combating Hate in the Age of Social Technology and The Douglas Cardinal Archive Project at Carleton University, and processing the YM-YWHA collection at the Jewish Public Library Archives.\n\n​ ​​\n\nKate Freedman (Ph.D. 2018) Librarian for History and Graduate Student Services, W.E.B. Du Bois Library (Amherst, MA)\n\nI discovered a passion for historical research when I was an undergrad at Hampshire College, through a course called Women in Early New England, taught at Mount Holyoke by Glendyne Wergland (who I learned later was herself an alum of the UMass Graduate History program!). My research paper in that class, on mother-daughter relationships among well-to-do white women in the Pioneer Valley, led to an undergraduate thesis and a sustaining interest in Early American history.\n\nIn search of an excuse to avoid going home over the summer between my junior and senior years of college, I applied to and was awarded a summer fellowship at the Newport Historical Society. This fellowship gave me both a love of public history and planted the seeds that would eventually become my dissertation topic! While there, I discovered that Newport was during the eighteenth century both the center of the North American slave trade and the center of the Quaker community in New England, which struck me as odd to say the least, because prior to this, I had thought that Quakers were ardent abolitionists. I desperately wanted to find out the historical root of this seeming paradox, but the summer ended before I could uncover the answer.\n\nEven with this historical quandary stuck in my brain though, I was too practical to go straight for my doctorate in history. Even in 2004, the American Historical Association was warning that it nearly impossible to get a faculty job, and I was wary of a career path that would require me to entirely surrender my future to the fates of the academic job market. Instead, I worked as a tour guide at the Emily Dickinson Museum for a year and then moved to Rhode Island to get my Master's in Library and Information Studies at the University of Rhode Island. Library school, however, was for the most part the opposite of inspiring - so much so that it almost put me off of librarianship entirely!\n\nAfter graduating with my MLIS in 2007, I fled back to my first love, history. Even so, however, I remained stubbornly practical and applied only to MA programs, with UMass at the top of my list. As far as I was concerned, UMass Amherst had it all: a nationally renowned public history program, a location relatively close to the archives I wanted to access in Rhode Island, and not one but two Early Americanists who were experts in Quaker history.\n\nHappily, my experience at UMass Amherst did not disappoint! I completed the Certificate in Public History, focusing on the digital humanities via work as a researcher on the Our Plural History project at Springfield Technical Community College, as a database developer for the Valley Women’s History Collaborative, and as the graduate assistant to the UMass Digital Humanities Initiative. I also discovered a love of teaching in my work as a TA for Women's History to 1890. When I completed my Master's, I didn't feel finished with being a scholar. Even five years out from my time in Newport, the question about the slave-trading Quakers in Rhode Island continued to bug me, so I finally did something impractical and stayed at UMass to work on a PhD.\n\nRight after I defended my dissertation prospectus in 2013 though, opportunity came knocking, in the form of a job posting for an Undergraduate Education Librarian at the UMass Amherst libraries. Jobs in research libraries are quite competitive, so I thought this would just be an opportunity to practice my job application skills, but surprisingly, I got the job! When I asked what made me stand out from the crowd of applicants, I found out that I was hired in large part because of the teaching and digital humanities experience that I had gained through the UMass history program.\n\nI spent the next five years launching the UMass Libraries' instruction program and finishing my dissertation (something that I was able to do successfully in large part because librarians at UMass function as pseudo-faculty, who are eligible for research leaves and sabbaticals). In 2019, I transitioned to a new role as the History and Graduate Student Services Librarian - a role where I get to indulge both my background as a historian and as a long-time graduate student! I'm also currently revising my dissertation into a book. Needless to say, I'm pretty happy about where I ended up.\n\nLaura Miller (M.A. 2009, Ph.D. 2014) Historical Consultant\n\nI received both my M.A. in Public History and my Ph.D. in 20th century U.S. History from UMass Amherst. After completing my Ph.D. in 2014, I worked as a Historian at the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, New York. In 2017, I moved back to Western Massachusetts and started a history consulting business.\n\nMy work has two different areas of focus: research and writing about the National Park Service, and research and writing about the history of philanthropy. On any given day, I might be conducting archival research, meeting oral history interviewees, or hunkering down in my office (or snuggling on the couch with my dogs) poring over research notes and drafting chapters.\n\nAs a graduate student, I took on several projects that helped expand my public history skill set, including research and writing for the National Park Service, developmental editing for UMass Press, and conducting oral histories for local historical organizations. These experiences gave me confidence to feel comfortable moving between wildly different research topics and resulting work products. As a consultant, my work covers the spectrum from short reports for philanthropic foundations, such as a history of the Ford Foundation’s grantmaking in the Deep South, to book-length works, such as a National Park Service administrative history of Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts. I cherish the variety of my day-to-day work and the flexibility it allows.\n\nI am a member of the National Council on Public History, and have served on the Digital Media Group and on the Professional Development Committee. I have also been an affiliate editor for NCPH's History@Work blog. In 2022, I was elected to the NCPH Board of Directors.\n\nAmanda Goodheart Parks (M.A. 2010, Ph.D. 2018) Director of Education, New England Air Museum (East Granby, CT)\n\nMy introduction to public history came in the form of an undergraduate internship at Mystic Seaport Museum. As a history and secondary education double major at Salve Regina University in historic Newport, RI, I was no stranger to museums and their potential to educate and inspire people of all ages. However, it wasn't until my summer at Mystic that I realized I wanted to pursue a graduate degree in public history as a means of blending my interests in education, history, and museums.\n\nI chose the UMass Public History Program for its faculty as well as its reputation as one of the leading public history graduate programs in the country. After completing my M.A. in 2010, I continued at UMass as a Ph.D. student with fields in the history of women and gender, public history, nineteenth century U.S. history, and environmental history. After eight years of working full-time in the museum field while researching and writing my dissertation, I successfully defended, \"'No Seas Can Now Divide Us: Captains' Wives, Sister Sailors, and the New England Whalefishery, 1840-1870,\" with distinction in May 2018. My dissertation focused on whaling captains' wives who defied social and industrial norms by going to sea together with their husbands aboard whaleships in the mid-nineteenth century. I am currently working on a popular history account of one of these couples, and I am active lecturer and guest speaker on topics relating to women's history at local colleges, museums, and historical societies.\n\nOver the course of my career I've had the privilege of working as a museum educator or historical interpreter at Mystic Seaport, The Preservation Society of Newport County, Historic Deerfield, Strawbery Banke Museum, and the Springfield Museums. I currently serve as the Director of Education at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, CT where I oversee a department of ten staff at the largest aerospace museum in our region. I am also a new Co-Chair for the New England Museum Association's Education Professional Affinity Group, as well as a member of the Westfield Historical Commission.\n\nAlex Asal (M.A., 2018) Encylopedia Digital Assistant at Jewish Women's Archive (Philadelphia, PA)\n\nI came in to the field of public history through my undergraduate education at Smith College. I knew I loved history, and was pretty sure I didn't want to teach in a traditional classroom, which was the default suggestion from everyone who heard my major. In search for a career that would not take me too far from the past, I applied to an internship at the Sophia Smith Collection and College Archives, and developed a passion for bridging the gap between \"the stuff\" and the public.\n\nAt UMass, my primary areas of interest were global Jewish History and U.S. women's history, in particular women's labor in the World War II era. At the Graduate History Conference in 2018 I presented a paper titled, \"Revisiting Rosie: Women, Labor, and World War II,\" and an article on women officer candidates in the Navy is slated to run in the Smith Alumnae Quarterly's Summer 2019 issue. While earning my MA I held internships with the Wexler Oral History Project, the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History, and the Mount Holyoke College Archive.\n\nFollowing my graduation from UMass, I moved to Philadelphia and began work as a tour guide at the Eastern State Penintentiary Historic Site. Find me on twitter @Alex_in_Public.\n\nAustin Clark (M.A., 2018) Library Media Specialist, Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter School (South Hadley, MA)\n\nHistory is tricky business. Between graduating from Gettysburg College in 2012 and coming to UMass in 2016, I worked a variety of jobs – as a librarian in a small public library, a substitute teacher for two separate middle schools, and as a site supervisor and interpreter for Canterbury Shaker Village in Canterbury, NH. While diverse in experience, the jobs I enjoyed the most had one thing in common. They were where history hit the pavement. I found great fulfillment in engaging with multi-faceted positions that required not only creative historical scholarship and interpretation, but also day-to-day ingenuity in solving the seemingly mundane problems of maintaining an organization as a vibrant public resource. In other words, I began to pursue a career as a public historian.\n\nStudying at UMass is a natural step in that career. While here, I have become immersed in both the practical and the philosophical aspects of public history and have come to understand the field as something greater than both – public service. No matter where they are, in academia or in the field, I believe public historians are defined by their conscious service to the public, in whatever form that takes. The opportunity UMass gave me to intern with Mass Humanities only reinforced this conviction. I worked on a variety of projects, including editing grants and arranging the donation of over 11,000 books. These tasks helped me understand that a large part of the work of public service is facilitating public access to humanities material and scholarship. Humanities, and history as a key part of that, is data in the human sense, information people need to make informed and critical decisions. Making sure that people have the access to the resources they need to keep telling stories and putting together projects remains crucial to my sense of purpose as a public historian.\n\nThe larger purpose of my education at UMass is to help me become a “student in the field,” a practitioner with enough confidence and knowledge to move forward, but with curiosity and an engaged mind that will keep making creative connections. So far, I have kept up this curiosity by studying and writing about graveyards and cemeteries, both in and academic and professional capacity. Along with fellow M.A. student Nolan Cool, I was hired as a historical consultant by the Leverett Cemetery Association to research six of their historic graveyards and make sure these sites were documented in the Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS). This experience not only helped me develop as a professional, but remains foundational for much of my research and inquiry into preservation and public history.\n\nMy academic interests lie in diverse areas, but at UMass I focused on the intersection of violence and nation-making in the nineteenth century and the history of classical art in college collections. I have researched and written about the history of the classical art collection at Mount Holyoke College and how early professors, notably Louise Fitz-Randolph and Caroline Galt, used the medium of display to drive the professionalization of their department. It is work I hope to expand on in the future and come to a greater understanding not just of art and museums, but of how art as a category of knowledge influences the way we see objects and artifacts today.\n\nFind me on twitter @thealtacademic\n\nNolan Cool (M.A., 2018) Educational Programs Director, Adirondack Architectural Heritage (Keeseville, NY)\n\nFor most of my life living in Upstate New York’s Mohawk Valley, a historically rich “middle ground,” I’ve always found change over time as it relates to people, communities, and the landscape, a concept not only visible, but deeply ingrained in landscapes. While attending community college, I spent my summers traveling to and experiencing New York’s abundant historic sites, museums, and cultural organizations, many of which rarely find their way into the public spotlight. Through actively pursuing different experiences across the state’s historical landscape, alongside a (relatively safe) addiction to historical research, public history clicked for me as my time as an undergrad at Utica College wrapped up. I carried my experiences with digitization, social media, and wacky ideas with me from my role in starting and managing the Utica College Center for Historical Research’s Digital History Project (via New York Heritage) to a formative summer 2016 internship at Hyde Hall, a historic mansion in Cooperstown, New York. Here, I worked to make the richly-detailed George Hyde Clarke Family Papers available to the public online, while also delivering tours and exploring the ins-and-outs of historic house museum management.\n\nIn fall 2016, I moved on from the Mohawk Valley and into the Pioneer Valley for graduate school here at UMass Amherst. As a graduate student in the History Department, more than anything, I learned how to turn my career goals into tangible projects. Continuing work in historic houses, I spent a short summer in 2017 with the Stone House Museum in Belchertown, Massachusetts, where I worked to explore how to make small museums more relevant to its surrounding community. Through interning at the Stone House, I also worked closely with the Pioneer Valley History Network to challenge local history museums and historical societies to rethink their collections, interpretation, and the visitor experience.\n\nOver the past year I have consulted on two preservation projects in Holyoke, MA and Leverett, MA. Both centered on cataloging city and town cemeteries for the Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS), a state-wide cultural resource database. Completing this work allowed me to survey and experience the interaction between public history and local government, a relationship that played out in the graveyard. Together with the Holyoke Historical Commission, Leverett Historical Society, and Leverett Cemetery Association, I helped create necessary MACRIS documentation constituting the basis for future preservation grant funding and potential National Register of Historic Places nominations in the future.\n\nApart from my work exploring possibilities in historic house museums or traversing New England’s graveyards, I focus my historical studies in Early America, particularly colonial and early New York State history. After graduating from UMass in May 2018, I entered the position of Educational Programs Director at Adirondack Architectural Heritage (AARCH), translating my background in historic houses, preservation, public history, and media into active field work. At AARCH, I work to create, coordinate, and execute a slate of educational programs taking the organization’s members all over Upstate New York’s Adirondack Park, a sprawl of wilderness and communities, both human and nonhuman. This position allows me to practice public history in the field, and to travel to lesser-known, historically-rich, and more private sectors of the North Country. At these sites, I am able to apply a continually-growing interest in tangibly bringing the past to historic preservation practice, and bringing the regional and national publics to better understand the intersection between history, communities, and broader environments.\n\nFind me on twitter @Nolan_Cool\n\n2010-2017\n\nShakti Castro (M.A., 2017), PhD student, Columbia University\n\nBorn and raised in The Bronx, New York, I received my Bachelor's degree in Media Studies and English Literature from Hunter College of the City University of New York. While still an undergraduate, I began working as a research assistant at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at CUNY, where I was able to combine my interests in history, storytelling, Postcolonial studies, and activism in order to help document the history of the Puerto Rican community in Diaspora. I came to UMass to continue doing this work and was fortunate enough to work closely with the Oral History Lab, and as a research assistant at the Center for Design Engagement and intern at Wistariahurst Museum to help document the Puerto Rican history of Holyoke, MA.\n\nAfter graduation, I received a competitive graduate fellowship through the Smithsonian Latino Center. I spent 6 weeks as a research fellow in the MedSci division at the National Museum of American History researching the history of the opioid crisis, harm reduction, and drug policy reform in New York City's Puerto Rican and Latinx communities. Following that experience, I was able to find work in the advocacy department of BOOM!Health, a public health nonprofit and syringe exchange focused on harm reduction in the South Bronx. I next accespted the position of Associate Director of Education Programs at Casita Maria Center for Arts & Education, a nonprofit focused on arts & culture in the Bronx. In Fall 2019, I entered the PhD program at Columbia Univerisity.\n\nKatherine Fecteau (M.A., 2017) Curator of Exhibitions, Old Sturbridge Village (Sturbridge, MA)\n\nKatherine graduated from Colby College with a degree in anthropology in 2013. A lifelong love of history and material culture led her to pursue graduate studies in history and public history, which she completed in 2017. She subsequently interned for the Boston Furniture Archive and worked as a Museum Attendant at Historic Deerfield. She also conducted research for the Kneeland & Adams Research Project, Historic Northampton, and the Springfield Museums. In September 2018, she began a Curatorial Fellowship at Old Sturbridge Village, and joined their permanent staff as the Assistant Curator in November of that year. In 2022, she became the Curator of Exhibitions, managing the Village’s permanent and long-term exhibits. Katherine also oversees the Village's Integrated Pest Management program and generates social media content to make the museum’s collection (most of which is in storage) visible to the public.\n\nFelicia Jamison (Ph.D., 2017) Assistant Professor of African American History, Drake University (Des Moine, IA)\n\nI received my M.A. from Morgan State University in 2010. My thesis analyzed the role of African-American women in the formation of Sharp Street United Methodist Church, one of the oldest black congregations in Baltimore, Maryland. I actively involved church members in the project by conducting oral histories. In addition, I used the physical space of the church and its artifacts to tell a broader story of late 19th/early-20th-century African-American women impacting their community through social uplift work. For my dissertation, I used archival methodology as well as oral history to recount the black freedom struggle of a Geechee community in rural Georgia from the 18th century until the 1940s. While pursuing my Ph.D. at UMass Amherst, I gained the practical skills of Public History through course work and various internships at the W.E.B. Du Bois National Historic Site and by working with Clinton Church Restoration, a community-based grassroots organization who raised funds to save the oldest African-American church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.\n\nAfter graduating, I worked as a President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland College Park during which I researched and began to write a monograph tentatively titled Reconstructing Freedom: Black Women and Property Ownership in the Rural South. The book analyzes the strategies and techniques Southern black women used to accumulate property during slavery in the antebellum period and purchase land and deed property to their progeny during Reconstruction. By tracing the practice of property and landownership through several generations, this study shows that Southern African Americans built on traditions of property ownership created in slavery to purchase and maintain ownership of land during the late 19th and early 20th century. It also shows that black women had long been integral in this process.\n\nWhile at the University of Maryland, I taught a course titled “Public Interpretations of African American History.” The class analyzes how African American history has been interpreted in the public sphere in museums and at historic sites, in public schools, and in films. And as a public historian, I actively incorporate Public History into my history courses by creating assignments in which students visit local museums, conduct oral histories of family members, and create blog posts based on their experiences at local historic sites.\n\nAfter my fellowship, I taught as an Assistant Professor of African American History at Drake University. Currently, I work as an Assistant Professor of History & Comparative Humanities at the University of Louisville.\n\nGregg Mitchell (M.A., 2017) Branch Supervisor, Mason Square Branch Library (Springfield, MA)\n\nGregg Mitchell received his BSE and Initial Licensure in Elementary Education from Westfield State University in 2012. He then worked in Holyoke, MA for four years in various educational capacities including classroom teacher, after-school program instructor, and student mentor in grades K-12. Gregg left his position with Holyoke Public Schools upon receiving acceptance to UMass Amherst’s MA in History program; in the Fall of 2015, he began both his MA coursework and working towards his Graduate Certificate in Public History. Gregg’s primary concentrations within public history focused on digital history and museum/historic site interpretation. Over the next two years, he worked with many local historical institutions in the area on a variety of projects. This included designing walking tours for smart phones, conducting and transcribing oral history interviews, designing interactive maps, and creating local history rooms. One of Gregg’s articles relating to rural libraries in Western Massachusetts was published on the Living New Deal’s website: https://livingnewdeal.org/regional-libraries-and-the-ruralurban-knowledg...\n\nIn addition to Gregg’s work in public history, his other major fields include economic and financial history as well as British and American imperialism. Gregg’s economic and financial history field explores the role of financial institutions from the late nineteenth century to present and their role in shaping the globalized world we live in today. His field also analyzes the contributions of globalization and free trade during this same time period. Gregg’s British and American imperialism field focuses on the means of control used by various imperial powers, how these means can justify the narrative for imperialism, and how imperialism affects the identity of those involved.\n\nAfter graduating in 2017, Gregg entered the world of public librarianship and continues to work with public history institutions on a variety of projects. In addition, Gregg completed his Master of Library & Information Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2021. He currently works as the Supervisor for Springfield (MA) City Library’s Mason Square Branch.\n\nFind me on twitter @Gregg_Mitch\n\nEmail me at GMitch132@gmail.com\n\nSelena Moon (M.A., 2017) Writer & Fact Checker, Minnesota Women's Press (St. Paul, MN); Interpreter, Edina Historical Society (Edina, MN)\n\nI graduated with my Bachelor's in History from Smith College in 2009 with a concentration in women's history. During my sophomore year, I took an American Studies course called \"The Narratives of Internment\" about the Japanese-American internment. My project for that class was researching bi-racial internees and bi-racial couples, after reading Jeanne Wakatsuki-Houston's \"Farewell to Manzanar\" and finding a reference to an African-American woman who had accompanied her husband there. My seminar paper dovetailed from that to discussing Japanese and Japanese-Americans at Smith. I became obsessed with my project and realized how much I enjoyed research and writing.\n\nSeveral years after graduating, I found myself drifting back toward my research interests when I began reading more internee autobiographies. I was fascinated by the personal connections many of the internees shared, including names of those I had found in the Smith archives. As I researched other aspects of the internment, I learned about the array of books written about Japanese-American history, from the long history of Japanese immigration to the psychological and economic impact of the interment. What started as a hobby of trying to connect the internees through their shared personal and professional experiences blossomed and I decided to continue my study of history and learn how to write for the public. I knew that I wanted to return to the east coast (I was home in Minnesota at the time) and was thrilled to discover the writing track of the Public History Program at UMass. My main focus is Asian-American history and I am eager to discover other interests as I pursue my degree.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, I interned at the National Museum of American History with the Executive Order 9066 exhibit opening in February 2017. The exhibit commemorates the 75th anniversary of President Franklin Roosevelt signing Executive Order 9066 which led to 120,000 Japanese-Americans being interned during World War II. I catalogued donated artifacts, researched the historical significance of the objects and the biographies of the owners. It added a great deal of depth to the objects to know their history and showed me just how much material there was associated with the Japanese-American internment. I hope to return to perform in-depth research on the hundreds of artifacts that I was only able to glimpse during my internship and time in the UMass Public History program.\n\nI currently work as a writer & fact checker for the Minnesota Women's Press, and as an interpreter for the Edina Historical Society in Edina, MN, interpreting the Historic Cahill School, built in 1864 and one of the oldest surviving buildings in Edina.\n\nFind me on twitter @SelenaNMoon\n\nSee my website at selenammoon.com\n\nKelli Morgan (Ph.D., 2017) Professor of the Practice, Curatorial Studies, Professor of the Practice, History of Art and Architecture, Director of Curatorial Studies, Tufts University (Medford, MA)\n\nOriginally from Detroit, MI., Dr. Kelli Morgan earned her doctorate in Afro-American Studies and a Graduate Certificate in Public History – Museum Studies in 2017 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass). A scholar and curator, Morgan has worked in a variety of curatorial, programming, teaching, and research positions at various institutions including The Tyler School of Art at Temple University, Wayne State University, the University of Michigan, the Birmingham Museum of Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA). In early 2014, Morgan was awarded a dissertation fellowship from the prestigious Ford Foundation. She was also named the Curatorial Fellow of African American Art at the Birmingham Museum of Art (2014 – 2015), and in 2016 became the inaugural recipient of The Winston & Carolyn Lowe Curatorial Fellowship for Diversity in the Fine Arts at PAFA.\n\nAs a critical race cultural historian, Morgan specializes in American art and visual culture. Her interdisciplinary research concentrates primarily on historic African American women artists, however her curatorial work often examines, critiques, and theorizes the ways in which American artists, art objects, art history, and art institutions both challenge and reify the systematic mechanisms of anti-Black violence and oppression in the United States. By analyzing the ways in which Americans construct visual discourses, conceptualize images, and sometimes resist these discourses, Morgan’s curatorial and pedagogical practices link Art History, Women’s Studies, African American History, and Museum Studies to create stimulating and culturally sensitive educational opportunities for students and public audiences alike.\n\nFor more on Kelli's work at the intersection of public history and contemporary art, see her interview on the history Department's blog, Past@Present.\n\nSara Patton Zarrelli (M.A., 2017) Associate Planner, Museum Insights (Harvard, MA) and Independent Historian\n\nSara Patton Zarrelli received her BA in History from Carleton College in 2010. She fell in love with the National Park Service after interning at the John F. Kennedy National Historic Site, and worked for a variety of National Park Service Units before becoming the lead park ranger at the John F. Kennedy National Historic Site in 2012. Inspired by the Imperiled Promise Report on the state of history in the National Park Service, Sara decided to go to graduate school to help shape the history program within the National Park Service. Sara began the MA program in 2015, in part because of Marla Miller's co-authorship of the Imperiled Promise Report. Sara's graduate work focused on landscape, memory and identity; her thesis Springing Forth Anew: Progress, Preservation, and Park-Building at Roger Williams National Memorial (found here) analyzed the role of community members in creating a national park unit during a period of urban renewal in Providence, Rhode Island. Following her graduation in 2017 with certificates in Public History and Cultural Landscape Management, Sara interned with the History Program of the Northeast Region of the National Park Service before accepting the position of Engagement Site Manager at the Old Manse, a property of the Trustees of the Reservation, in Concord MA. In this role, Sara designed interpretive program, trained and managed interpretive staff, organized special events and programming, and served as a liaison to the community. In 2019, Sara left the Old Manse to begin work with Museum Insights, a small firm that helps museums plan for change through business plans, feasibility studies, and master plans. In addition to her work with Museum Insights, Sara is the Principal Investigator for the Administrative History of Longfellow House-Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.\n\nEmail me at spzarrelli@gmail.com\n\nRebekkah Rubin (M.A., 2017) Freelance History Writer\n\nOriginally from Canton, Ohio, I received my B.A. in History from Oberlin College in 2013. After graduating, I worked as a historical interpreter at Old World Wisconsin—a living history museum—and crafted educational programming for children at Madison Children’s Museum. I also served as the Volunteer Coordinator for an elementary school in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, where I helped match at-risk students with community volunteers for literacy tutoring sessions. After working in these diverse roles that all emphasized education and communication, I decided to attend UMass to learn more about how to make history accessible and interesting for varying audiences.\n\nI received my Masters in History with a Graduate Certificate in Public History in 2017. While at UMass, I completed fields of study in public history with an emphasis on writing beyond the academy, modern European history, and history of the book. Those interests melded into my article-length paper entitled “‘Unhistoric Acts: American Women Reading George Eliot in the Progressive Era,” which won the Caldwell Writing Prize. During the summer of 2016, I received a Hyde Fellowship and completed two internships focused on publishing and writing history at University of Massachusetts Press and Belt Magazine. My passion for communicating history shaped my studies, practice, and teaching style; I was honored to receive the Ermonian Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching in 2017. I am currently a freelance history writer, and I enjoy writing on the role public history plays in our everyday lives, from museums and historic sites to historical memory and memorial, as well as the intersections between history and works of fiction and historical fiction. My work has appeared in Belt Magazine, Smithsonian.com, The Week, and Electric Literature.\n\nSee my website here https://rebekkahrubin.com\n\nFind me on twitter @rebekkahrubin\n\nDanping Wang (M.A., 2017) Ph.D. Student, Columbia University (New York, NY)\n\nI was first introduced to the idea of public history in an undergraduate course offered by professor CHEN Xin at Zhejiang University. Upon learning this concept, I was immediately intrigued by its focus on sharing authority. Interested in learning more about public history, I worked as a volunteer for the first Public History Faculty Training in China in the summer of 2014, where I met and talk to professor David Glassberg and Richard Anderson, an alumni of the public history program.\n\nAfter I got admitted to the history MA/public history program at UMass Amherst, I focused on studying Modern Chinese history and exploring theories and practice of historic preservation. I took several courses with the Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning department and the Architecture Department, which better prepared me in terms of preservation theories. The faculty members and alumni of the program also offered great assistance in terms of reaching out and finding internships.\n\nNow I am a Ph.D. student at Columbia University, studying Chinese pharmaceutical history in the twentieth century, with a focus on the production and circulation of fake medicine. Although I am not currently doing anything directly related to public history, I gradually came to see how my training here shaped and continues to shape who I am as a historian. This program has encouraged me to pay more attention to audiences and push boundaries. It also enabled me to see history both as art and way of communication with general public.\n\nRose Gallenberger (M.A., 2016) Director, Mount Clare Museum House (Baltimore, MD)\n\nI completed my BA at Wisconsin Lutheran College, a small liberal arts college (approximately 1000 students when I attended) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. While I received a good foundation in writing and research, I did not get the sense that material culture was “real history.” It was not until my second semester in the public history program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst that I came to realize that I could research objects and the broader concept of material culture academically.\n\nEven though my primary interest is in early American material culture, I knew a public history program was the path for me. Rather than examining objects in a vacuum or within their historical context only, I wanted to be able to consider the needs of the public and what broader narrative concerning the tangible past I could communicate with them and how. My primary interest is the placement of material culture within the context of a living history museum or an historic home.\n\nI was able to apply what I learned in the public history classroom at the living history level. With the support of the UMass Public History Program's Hyde Fellowship, I completed my summer internship researching 17th-Century Maryland material culture to evaluate the interpretive collections at the Godiah Spray plantation. I provided documentation for the reproductions used at the recreated 17th century plantation and began creating a master list of items found in early Maryland probate inventories. After obtaining my masters, I served as a summer curatorial intern in textiles and historic interiors at Colonial Williamsburg. There, I studied textiles and wrote the furnishing plan and research report portraying the Peyton Randolph house as Comte de Rochambeau’s headquarters prior to the Siege of Yorktown.\n\nThese two internships, the four internships I completed as an undergrad, and my education aided me in receiving, and accepting, a job offer near the end of my internship at Colonial Williamsburg. I am currently the site manager at Mount Clare Museum House, the 1760s home of Charles Carroll, Barrister. B&O Railroad Museum operates it and the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America owns the collections. As the only employee at Mount Clare, I am the curator, volunteer and docent coordinator, researcher, educator, and administrator, and I have a fantastic opportunity to reimagine the museum.\n\nDeborah Kallman (M.A., 2016) Director of Finance (retired), Historic Deerfield (Deerfield, MA)\n\nI have taken a somewhat non-traditional route to UMass. I returned to school following a career in the finance and accounting fields. Having spent much of my professional life in higher education financial administration, I recognize the transformative power of education. I was thrilled to pursue my personal dream of studying history. I was initially drawn to UMass because of its highly regarded Public History program. Public historians play an important role in making history and historical sites approachable to the general public. My own passion for history was ignited by visiting many of the historic sites in New England. Since my first visit to campus, I felt part of the UMass history community and I continue to be impressed not only with the UMass faculty and scholarship, but the vast resources that are available through the Five College Consortium. In addition to the field of Public History, I studied modern European history and Modern U.S. history.\n\nI completed an internship at The Mount—Edith Wharton’s former residence in western Massachusetts. I applied what I learned in the classroom to the professional practice of public history and this internship further supported my interest in education as I wrote lesson units for two of The Mount’s onsite school programs and adapted a physical exhibit to an online format. This practicum reinforced my belief in the transformative power of education and that, indeed, education does not only occur in a formal classroom setting. After completing my MA I accepted a position as Business Manager at The Mount. Currently, I am the Director of Finance at Historic Deerfield.\n\nIn addition, I maintain research interests situated within the Progressive era and specifically to the study of a utopian farm in West Newbury, Massachusetts. In Fall 2019, I returned to UMass History to pursue my PhD, while continuing in my work at Historic Deerfield. I retired from my position at Historic Deerfield in 2021.\n\nKathleen Mahoney (M.A., 2016) Instructional Designer & e-Learning Developer, Imprivita (Canton, MA)\n\nI completed my B.A. in History at Boston College in 2009 where my senior honors thesis looked at representations of black culture in Jazz Age France. I chose the UMass Public History program both for its academic rigor and for the opportunity to develop the professional skills necessary to do historical work outside of the classroom. As a Master’s student, I am completing coursework in archives while also continuing to pursue my interests in 20th century urban history and the history of American popular culture. With the support of the UMass Public History Program's Hyde Fellowship, in the summer of 2015 I was thrilled to gain firsthand experience doing archival work with internships with the WGBH Media Library and Archives and with documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Since finishing school, I spend my time playing music and volunteering at Girls Rock Camp Boston. You can find my music here.\n\nChel Miller (M.A., 2016) Communications Director, New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault (Albany, NY)\n\nPronouns: they/them/theirs\n\nI am a survivor-advocate, public historian, and prison abolitionist living and working on occupied and unceded Muh-he-con-neok (Mohican) and Haudenosaunee land in what is currently called upstate New York.\n\nAs a graduate student, my fields of interest included US history, global history, and social-justice informed scholarship. During the 2015-16 academic year, I completed an internship at the Institute for Curatorial Practice curating an online exhibition of textiles in the Five College Museums’ collections, titled The Third Space: Textiles in Material and Visual Culture. I also contributed content to a national traveling exhibition titled States of Incarceration: A National Dialogue of Local Histories, which included video interviews, blog posts, and an exhibit panel on the history of gendered incarceration in Massachusetts. In the final year of my graduate studies, I served as the 2015–16 Communications Assistant for the Department of History.\n\nBy day, I manage communications for the New York State Coalition Against Sexual Assault. I serve on the Board of Directors of the Capital District Chapter of the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and the Board-led Subcommittee on Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment at the National Council on Public History (NCPH). In my spare time, I enjoy baking; creating and viewing art; engaging in local and online activism centered around survivor justice, racial justice, disability justice, fat liberation, and prison abolition; and spending time with my cat, Luna, and two birds, Ginger and Kass.\n\nFind me on twitter @liberationfemme\n\nSee my wesbite here https://mxchelmiller.wordpress.com/\n\nSandra Perot (M.A., 2008; Ph.D., 2016) Director, Advanced Humanities Research, Berkshire School (Sheffield, MA)\n\nI came to UMass Amherst for a Master's Degree in History because of the Public History program. The focus here on the importance of landscape and community allows public history students to visualize history and, more importantly, help the public visualize history as well. With an MA in English Literature and teaching from San Jose State University, and an AB in English from Princeton University, I spent several years teaching high school English and American Literature, though I've always incorporated a cultural approach to teaching literature. After becoming involved as a guide at the Emily Dickinson Museum here in Amherst, I wanted to discover what makes museums work and how to make them successful. Public History, for me, is the perfect blend of history, culture, and literature. Since then I have worked both at local museums and internationally. I spent a summer as an educational intern at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, UK; conducted an extensive inventory of material culture at The Evergreens, part of the Emily Dickinson Museum in Amherst; and worked both as a guide and as staff support at the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum in The Netherlands. Eventually I decided to stay at UMass for a PhD. My dissertation research examined transatlantic influences throughout the Anglophone world, particularly the way in which 17th- and 18th-century women in theater interacted with, experienced and examined their surroundings as they moved from place to place. Currently, I am the Director of Advanced Humanities Research at Berkshire School in Sheffield, MA.\n\nJulie Peterson (M.A., 2016) Experience Developer at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (Denver, CO)\n\nJulie Peterson's interest in public history arose during her undergraduate career while studying the built environment to understand how the actions of people throughout history have impacted the physical environment, the political landscape, and the cultural milieu of the United States, particularly in the post-war period. At UMass, she studied the twentieth-century United States as an empire, social justice issues—particularly the rise of the prison-industrial complex and mass incarceration—and the cultural and political interchange between the United States and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. Throughout her study of public history, she seeks to find ways that museums and historic sites can encourage the public to think about the society we live in within a historical context, and through oral history, to tell the stories of those whose voices are typically silenced. During the summer of 2015, as a recipient of one of the UMass Public History program's Hyde Fellowships, Julie completed an internship at Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site in Philadelphia, PA. While there, she helped develop the award-winning Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration, an exhibit about the contemporary U.S. criminal justice system that opened in May 2016. Julie completed the MA in History with a Public History Certificate in May 2016, with her capstone research project, \"Interpreting Incarceration: Penal Tourism at the Museum of Colorado Prisons.\" After graduation, she curated \"The Carceral Commonwealth/ La mancomunidad carcelaria,\" an exhibit for UMass Amherst in collaboration with The New School’s States of Incarceration project, which opened in March 2017.\n\nJulie works at the History Colorado Center as a public historian/exhibit developer. She works to bring exhibits to life, collaborating with History Colorado colleagues, doing research and interpretive writing, and conducting audience evaluation. She is currently the lead developer for an exhibit geared toward an audience of middle and high school students all about civic engagement, philanthropy, and entrepreneurship in Colorado. She also participates in the Denver Evaluation Network. Julie’s work—particularly in the area of public history and the carceral state—has been published in The Public Historian and Museums & Social Issues. Julie is also an active member of the National Council on Public History, and serves as co-chair of the organization’s New Professional and Graduate Student Committee.\n\nShe invites fellow alumni, faculty, and current students to look her up if they find themselves out West! Feel free to reach out via email (julie.peterson@state.co.us), or follow her on Twitter: @juliegpeterson.\n\nIn November 2022, Julie accepted a role as Experience Developer at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science in Denver, CO.\n\nNuri Sherif (M.A., 2016) Fair Housing Testing Coordinator, Community Legal Aid (Springfield, MA); Legal Assistant, Gender Identity Validation Services (Northampton, MA)\n\nWhen I was thirteen years old, I desperately wanted Abigail Chase’s job from National Treasure -- National Archives and Records Administration archivist by day, adventurous history hunter by night. Now that I am in UMass’ Public History program, I can say that my ambitions have shifted from the archives to the recording studio. At UMass, I studied oral history theory and methodology in the hopes of releasing my inner Studs Terkel and using the oral histories I and others conducted to inform my academic research.\n\nAs an undergraduate at Gettysburg College, I planted myself firmly in early American history by studying both Lenni Lenape acculturation into western culture and an 1859 Supreme Court Case, Ableman v. Booth, each on a separate occasion. While at Gettysburg, I also flirted with memory studies and did research on how Great War prisoners of war remember their war experience and did research on how one Holocaust survivor’s memoir confronted and justified her camp experience. My work with memory studies propelled me into the twenty-first century where I am currently studying LGBT and sexuality history in America and Britain. My graduate research examined domestic violence in queer relationships which will be a departure point for further study on the prevalence of violence within the LGBT community.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, I worked as a seasonal Park Ranger at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park where I led programs for middle school students on John Brown and leadership. I also participated in Harpers Ferry NHP’s Theatre in the Park program. Additionally, I completed my UMass summer practicum at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History (NMAH). At NMAH, I worked in the Division of Medicine and Science primarily writing object descriptions for an unaccessioned veterinary collection. Beginning in February 2017 I began serving as the social media editor for NOTCHES, a peer-reviewed blog on the history of sexuality.\n\nWhen I am not studying history, I can be found wandering the streets of Northampton, going on a self-guided blueberry tour of the local farm stands (seasonally, of course), antiquing, walking my dog, Rain, reading P.G. Wodehouse, horseback riding, watching Netflix, or daydreaming about Scotland.\n\nRebecca Schmitt (M.A., 2015) National Register Coordinator, Tennessee Historical Commission (Nashville, TN)\n\nThroughout my life, I have always had a love of history as I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin and later near Cape Girardeau, Missouri. However, it was not until I went to Southeast Missouri State University for my undergraduate work that I realized the vast array of employment opportunities within Public History and Preservation. While working on my BA in History and BS in Historic Preservation, I completed multiple skill-based projects such as architectural inventory surveys, National Register of Historic Places nominations, building conditions assessments, strategic plans, and traditional history research and historiographical essays. Along the way, I completed two internships at the Stars and Stripes Museum in Bloomfield, MO and the Lutheran Heritage Center and Museum in Altenburg, MO.\n\nAfter graduating from Southeast in 2013, I came to UMass to pursue a Master’s Degree in History with a specialization in Public History and Historic Preservation. Within the program, I was able to complete projects such as a National Register of Historic Places nomination and an architectural walking tour for the Springfield Museums. In my coursework, I discovered new methods of investigating and interacting with the past, primarily through the study of memory, landscapes, and heritage tourism.\n\nDuring the summer of 2014, I completed an amazing internship at the Maryland Historical Trust, the State Historic Preservation Office for Maryland. I worked within their easement program and updated inventory documentation on easement properties. This included photo-documentation, on-site building analysis and investigation, and archival research on the site’s history. My project covered a wide range of structures including a theater, railroad station, private homes, a boat, and even a lighthouse. It was an opportunity that helped me realize what career I would like to pursue, which would preferably be within a consulting firm or historic agency.\n\nAfter graduating from UMass, I attended Eastern Michigan University and earned my Master of Science in Historic Preservation in 2015. From 2015 to 2017 I worked for the Michigan Historical Marker Program. I reviewed marker applications, verified primary source research, performed additional research as necessary, and wrote marker texts, coordinating the final texts to follow best historical practice while incorporating the viewpoints of sponsors and commissioners from the politically-appointed Michigan Historical Commission. I completed almost 50 markers, which have been installed throughout the state to educate the public on Michigan’s diverse and significant history. In December 2017, I became the co-National Register Coordinator for the Tennessee Historical Commission (State Historic Preservation Office). I deal with anything and everything related to the National Register, including writing and reviewing nominations, providing guidance to members of the public, and administering grants for nomination projects. In the Fall of 2018 I also began my PhD studies in Public History at Middle Tennessee State University. My dissertation will focus on historical markers as a method of public history, focusing specifically on issues of memory, shared authority, cultural politics, place making, and preservation.\n\nKayla Weisenberger (M.A., 2015) PhD Student, William and Mary\n\nI have always been interested in a multidisciplinary approach to studying the past; however, the further I advanced my degree, the less wiggle room I seemed to have. I bounced between universities during my undergraduate years, trying to find a way to combine by interests in Early America, Archaeology, and Museum Studies in a manner that made me a viable candidate in the job market. My senior thesis at the University of Oklahoma, “The Worlds of Monticello Mountain: How Space Reflected Power & Politics on an Eighteenth Century Plantation,” was written out of my experience attending the University of Virginia-Monticello Archaeological Field School. I analyzed Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello plantation in terms of what the organization of physical space can teach us about politics and power on an early national plantation.\n\nI regularly crossed disciplinary boundaries putting history, archaeology, and anthropology in conversation with one another to produce a clearer, more vibrant understanding of the past. Without museums and historical sites, that not only preserve the past, but disseminate their findings to the public through online databases such as the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery, my research would not have been possible.\n\nI realized that the study of public history would allow me to combine and hone my interests, and engage with the public in a manner that truly brings history alive. UMass Amherst’s Public History program allowed me to grow as a traditional historian while at the same time gain invaluable hands-on experience in the field. During my second year I developed an interest in blending the study of space and place in the Virginia Piedmont during the Early Republic with historic preservation and completed an internship at James Monroe's Ash-Lawn Highland. Upon graduation I accepted a position as curator of the Wethersfield (CT) Historical Society, and a year later became Director of Research and Interpretation there. From there I moved on to the Historic Westfield in Columbus, Georgia, and then to my a position as administrative assistant to the Director in the Institute of Material Sciences at the University of Connecticut. In time I decided to resume my graduate studies, and in Fall of 2019, began a PhD program in History at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA.\n\nCheck out this interview with Kayla as she commenced her PhD program.\n\nEmily Pipes (M.A., 2015) Project Coordinator, Center for Education Policy Research, Harvard University (Cambridge, MA)\n\nI graduated from the Commonwealth Honors College of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2012 with a B.A. in History and minors in Classics and Spanish. I wrote my honors thesis on the civil rights activism of Young Women’s Christian Association during the era of McCarthy, more specifically: the divide within the organization caused by the fear of communism during recurrent red scares, the rift this tension caused within its membership, and the effect this division had on the organization’s activism. This project relied upon primary source materials found in the YWCA of the USA records at the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College, scholarship on the YWCA, the Cold War, mid-twentieth century women, and progressive movements. During my undergraduate career I also worked as an intern in the Special Collection and University archives, where I catalogued and created a finding aid for the George Millman Papers.\n\nAs a Master’s student at UMass Amherst I continued my study of 20th century US history with a focus on the intersection of race, gender/feminism and public policy. My primary focus within public history was public policy. I completed an internship at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) in Boston (summer 2014) and in Springfield (fall semester 2014). As an intern at the MCAD, I was able to hone my ability to historicize political problems by analyzing current social conditions and attempting to piece together the historical events which created modern-day society. Working at the MCAD revealed to me some of the many ways in which public policy, law and history are constantly in conversation with one another.\n\nI currently work as a project coordinator for the Center for Education Policy Research (CEPR) at Harvard University. Through my work at CEPR, I am able to apply the research, writing and analytical thinking skills I developed at UMass to my daily responsibilities; which typically include conducting literature reviews; collecting and analyzing data; recruiting and interviewing subjects; and summarizing project results. I am excited by the opportunity to employ a historical perspective on contemporary policy analysis.\n\nI am now also pursuing a second master's degree from the Harvard School of Education in Education Policy and Management.\n\nEmily Hunter (M.A., 2015) Ph.D. Student, Department of History, Syracuse University (Syracuse, NY)\n\nGrowing up in Cooperstown, NY, home to several museums and to the New York State Historical Association Library, I developed an appreciation for public history at a young age. Throughout my middle and high school years, I enjoyed working as a volunteer interpreter at The Farmers’ Museum, a living history museum which recreates life in an 1840s village. As a history major at the State University of New York at Oneonta, I began to focus my passion for public history on archives and special collections libraries. Through an internship at the New York State Historical Association Library and as an intern and researcher in the archives at my university’s Milne Library, I accessioned and created catalogues for archival materials, conducted oral history interviews, compiled materials for library publications, and participated in outreach programs which introduced the public to the archival holdings. For the last 2 years, I have served as a moderator at the Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture, an annual event hosted by the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nI chose the public history program at UMass-Amherst because it allowed me to combine historical research and writing with the skills I need for my career in archive management. I was drawn to the program because of the rich archival resources available through the Five College Consortium and because of the professors whose areas of expertise link to my own research goals. At UMass, my research focused on women in the U.S. Progressive Era and first-wave feminism. After graduating from UMass I decided to continue my studies and I am currently pursuing a degree in Archival Studies at Syracuse University.\n\nKatie Garland Zimmerman (M.A., 2015), Foundation Partnerships and Grants Manager, Central Pennsylvania Food Bank (Harrisburg, PA)\n\nAfter a fantastic undergraduate experience in the History Department at Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania and a summer at the Historic Deerfield Summer Fellowship Program in Early American Material Culture, deciding to pursue public history at UMass Amherst was an easy choice. I knew that the program would rigorously train me as a historian while also giving me the opportunity to learn more about public history by doing hands on projects with museums across the Pioneer Valley. As I worked through the MA program, I began to realize that while I felt good about my history knowledge and public history skills, I did not know a lot about nonprofit management. Therefore, I added an extra year onto my program by pursuing a certificate in arts management through the Arts Extension Service.\n\nWhen I had difficulty finding public history jobs after graduation, I fell into a nonprofit fundraising job. I soon discovered that I really enjoy fundraising, and that my background in both public history and arts management had prepared me very well for a career that I did not know I wanted! As it turns out, writing and speaking to public audiences about the past is remarkably similar to writing and speaking to public audiences about a cause you believe in. I currently work as the Fund Development Coordinator for Girl Scouts in the Heart of Pennsylvania. I manage our council's United Way grants and am in charge of our donor database. I also provide support to a wide variety of other fundraising activities. Even though I am not actively working as a public historian, I use my public history training on a daily basis. In November 2018 I wrote about how I incorporated public history in my work for the Girl Scouts on the AHA's Perspectives blog. I later accepted a position as grant writer for the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank, and now serve as Foundation Partnerships and Grants Manager for the organization.\n\nMatt Coletti (M.A., 2015) Research Historian, History Associates (Rockville, MD)\n\nBelieve it or not, I recall my first visit as a toddler to one of the country’s stirring National Parks: Antietam National Battlefield. As my family and I strolled across the rolling hills of outside of Sharpsburg, Maryland, my imagination ran wild from the countless stories of the American Civil War that the Park Rangers recounted. That family trip planted the seed that blossomed into my boundless curiosity about United State history. Toward the end of my undergraduate studies at Washington College in 2012, I realized that I wanted to continue with my education, and become a professional historian working in the public sphere. My interests in historical memory began to form at this point, and I knew that I wanted to combine my American Civil War fascination with its resonance in contemporary, American society. Based on my experiences at the Park Service’s Civil War battlefields, I knew that a career with the Park Service was possible. The idea of how park staff compresses the national narrative to an intimate level for its visitors was something I admired and aspired to join. I was able to apply the knowledge I obtained from the public history faculty to the internship that I completed during the summer of 2014. I spent the better part of four months working with the staff at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park to design and interpret visitor programs that explored the complex connections between the town and the national events encompassing the Federalist Era, the Civil War, and Reconstruction. Following the completion of my internship with the National Park Service, I worked on an interpretive program that will enable park employees to educate visitors in the intimate relationship concerning Harpers Ferry and Reconstruction history. With my career hopes and academic interests in mind, I knew that the public history program at the University of Massachusetts offered an exceptional, educational opportunity, and a pathway to service with the National Parks. The program’s focus on memory studies as well as historic site interpretation fully prepared me for connecting local and national audiences with their history, and upon graduation I accepted a position with History Associates in Rockville, MD.\n\nJohn Dickson (M.A., 2014) Foreign Service Officer (Retired), U.S. Department of State (Pittsfield, MA)\n\nDuring my two year public history master’s degree program, I was struck by the number of times that we heard the notion of public history entrepreneur. Six months after graduation, I find that that’s what best describes my current activities, opened up through the public history program.\n\nOriginally, I came to UMass to explore the connection between history and foreign relations, how history shapes our national identities and influences the way we conduct our interactions with other countries. Once on campus, though, it was hard not to take advantage of the broad range of opportunities available, leading to a broadly eclectic, rather than narrowly specialized course of study/research. From participation in the Guantanamo Public Memory Project exhibit, to an internship at Herman Melville’s home, Arrowhead; from a thesis on the preservation of the old Berkshire Athenaeum in Pittsfield to preparation of a book proposal on history and foreign relations – all made for a full, active experience on campus.\n\nSince graduating, I define my involvement by a series of discrete projects – support to a historic survey of North Adams, MA; teaching a class on history and foreign relations at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College; continuing to interpret at Arrowhead; completing an on-line tour of Pittsfield’s Mills (milltour.org) supporting Fulbright scholarship advising at UMass; completing a documentary on the preservation of the old Berkshire Athenaeum, and serving as the Chair of the Pittsfield Historical Commission. I published a memoir entitled History Shock: When History Collides with Foreign Relations in 2021 with University of Kansas Press.\n\nShuko Tamao (M.A., 2014) Postdoctoral fellow, The National Museum of American History (Washington D.C.)\n\nI grew up in Hiroshima where there is little historical continuity in its landscape. The memory and the past were erased. I grew up in such a landscape and thought this absence of the memory; the detachment from the past was a universal experience. I did not want to believe it; I rebelled against it.\n\nAfter working at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I lived and travelled to various countries, hoping to absorb what lies beyond my initial life experience. I have worked and volunteered to hear the lives of my fellow neighbors through the lens of my camera, by the crumbling walls of abandoned buildings, across the counter at public libraries, and beyond the prison wall of rural Midwest. My passion started from engaging with my community and I have been supported by grateful neighbors and colleagues who have helped me pursue my intellectual journey.\n\nI am interested in the development of the asylum in 19th and 20th century Massachusetts. I pay a close attention to the interaction between people and the built environment. My encounter of state hospital cemeteries was the crucial moment for the development of my academic interest. Why and how could people's identities be reduced to numbers? What were their life stories? What is madness? I became aware of those questions while writing my blog the Reversed View of Massachusetts where I document and gather the voices of forgotten and/or extraordinary people who I meet in everyday life. I hope that my training in public history can help me to continue telling \"people's history.\"\n\nDuring my Master's, I researched the history of the Psychiatric Survivors Movement as well as the Disability Rights Movement by processing the papers for a Boston-based activist, Judi Chamberlin, at the UMass Special Collections and Universty Archives. As a PhD student at the University at Buffalo, I hope to continue my research into these areas. I was also a Career Diversity fellow in the American Historical Association's Career Diversity Implementation Grants program, and after completing my degree held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Buffalo Center for Disability Studies. In September 2021 I began a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Museum of American History.\n\nJacob Orcutt (M.A., 2014) Coordinator of Onsite Services, Connecticut’s Old State House (Hartford, CT)\n\nPrior to attending UMass I earned a B.A. in History, Anthropology, and Archaeological Studies from SUNY Potsdam. While attending SUNY Potsdam I served on the school's Honors Council and held positions in several student organizations, and was fortunate to have an opportunity to participate in an archaeological excavation in Menorca, Spain through the Ecomuseo de Cavalleria and the Sanisera Institute. Additionally, it was at SUNY Potsdam that I developed a passion for historical research in the fields of Early American and Indigenous history.\n\nI fell into Public History rather by accident. Before applying to the University of Massachusetts for my M.A. program I had very little knowledge of Public History. The streng"
