        "text": "Past Events\n\nSpeaking of Books with Linda Rabben: Through a Glass Darkly: The Social History of Stained Glass in Baltimore\n\nDate: November 13, 2023\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly is based on two years' on-the-ground, library and archival research in a city of architectural treasures that reflect a long history of racial, religious and ethnic segregation. Stained-glass makers struggle to produce beautiful products of an endangered craft.\n\nLinda Rabben is an Associate Research Professor of Anthropology at UMD. She joined the department’s professional track faculty in 2015, after a long career in the nonprofit sector. The author of ten published books and numerous articles on human rights and related subjects, she worked for Amnesty International and other nongovernmental organizations for more than 30 years.\n\nDr. Rabben did anthropological field research in and on the United States, Britain and Brazil and was a UN election observer in Mozambique. She has spoken about human rights and migration issues to diverse audiences in the US, UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Brazil and France. In 2014 she coordinated an international conference on the global grassroots environmental movement at American University in Washington, D.C. Since moving to Baltimore in 2021 she has been doing research on the city’s architectural history. Publication of her eleventh book, Through a Glass Darkly: The Social History of Stained Glass in Baltimore, is scheduled in November 2023.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Julius Fleming: Black Patience: Performance, Civil Rights, and the Unfinished Project of Emancipation\n\nDate: October 26, 2023\n\nBlack Patience: Performance, Civil Rights, and the Unfinished Project of Emancipation (2022) reconsiders the Civil Rights Movement from the perspective of black theatre. It argues that theatre—like television and photography—was a vital tool of civil rights activism and a crucial site of black artistic and cultural production. During this historical moment, black artists and activists turned to the stages of Broadway. They produced plays in the Netherlands, and in U.S. prisons. They performed in the cotton fields of Mississippi, once dodging a bomb tossed from the audience to the stage. Analyzing a largely underexplored, transnational archive of black theatre, this book charts a new cultural and political history of the Civil Rights Movement, and offers new routes to perennial questions about race, gender, sexuality, performance, and black political modernity. Taking this archival intervention as its foundation, Black Patience argues that black people used theatre in the Civil Rights Movement to unsettle a violent racial project that Fleming calls black patience. From slave castles to the holds of slave ships, from auction blocks to commands to “go slow” in fighting segregation, black people have historically been forced to wait and coerced into performing patience. During the movement, however, their radical cries for “freedom now” disturbed the historical practice of deploying black patience as a tool of anti-black oppression. Theatre was crucial to these efforts. Whether staging Waiting for Godot at a black church in the Mississippi Delta, or James Baldwin’s Blues for Mister Charlie in London, or Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun in Indiana during the 1963 emancipation centennial to illuminate how black people were still waiting for freedom a century later, black people used theatre to challenge the violent cultures of black patience. In studying these acts, this book not only unfurls theatre’s cultural and political value to the movement, but also elaborates the constitutive role of racialized time (e.g., waiting) and affect (e.g., long-suffering) in the production of racial modernity.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Peter Grybauskas: The Battle of Maldon Together with the Homecoming of Beorhtnoth\n\nDate: September 13, 2023\n\nThis \"Speaking of Books\" event is about the first-ever standalone edition of one of J.R.R. Tolkien’s most important poetic dramas which explores timely themes such as the nature of heroism and chivalry during war, featuring previously unpublished and never-before-seen texts and drafts. In 991 AD, Vikings attacked an Anglo-Saxon defense-force led by their duke, Beorhtnoth, resulting in brutal fighting along the banks of the river Blackwater, near Maldon in Essex. The attack is widely considered one of the defining conflicts of tenth-century England, due to it being immortalized in the poem, The Battle of Maldon. Written shortly after the battle, the poem now survives only as a 325-line fragment, but its value to today is incalculable, not just as a heroic tale but in vividly expressing the lost language of our ancestors and celebrating ideals of loyalty and friendship. J.R.R. Tolkien considered The Battle of Maldon “the last surviving fragment of ancient English heroic minstrelsy.” It would inspire him to compose, during the 1930s, his own dramatic verse-dialogue, The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm’s Son, which imagines the aftermath of the great battle when two of Beorhtnoth’s retainers come to retrieve their duke’s body.\n\nLeading Tolkien scholar and principal lecturer at the University of Maryland, Peter Grybauskas, presents for the very first time J.R.R. Tolkien’s own prose translation of The Battle of Maldon together with the definitive treatment of The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth and its accompanying essays; also included and never before published is Tolkien’s bravura lecture, “The Tradition of Versification in Old English,” a wide-ranging essay on the nature of poetic tradition. Illuminated with insightful notes and commentary, he has produced a definitive critical edition of these works, and argues compellingly that, Beowulf excepted, The Battle of Maldon may well have been “the Old English poem that most influenced Tolkien’s fiction,” most dramatically within the pages of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Adi Mahalel: The Radical Isaac: I. L. Peretz and the Rise of Jewish Socialism\n\nDate: April 26, 2023\n\nYiddish and Hebrew writer I. L. Peretz (1852-1915) was a major leader of Eastern European Jewry in the years prior to World War I, and was deeply involved in Jewish politics and communal life throughout his lifetime. In The Radical Isaac, Adi Mahalel examines a central part of his life and art that has often been neglected, namely, his close alignment with the needs of the Jewish working-class and his deep devotion to progressive politics. Although there have been numerous studies of Peretz and his work, this very central component of his life nonetheless remains severely understudied. By offering close readings of the \"radical\" Peretz, Mahalel recasts the way political activism is understood in scholarly evaluations of the writer's work. Employing a partly chronological, partly thematic scheme, Mahalel follows Peretz's radicalism from its inception and then through the various ways in which it was synchronically expressed during this intense period of history.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Thomas Zeller: Consuming Landscapes: What We See When We Drive and Why It Matters\n\nDate: March 9, 2023\n\nThe view from the road is one of the main ways in which we experience our environments. These vistas are the result of deliberate historical forces, and humans have shaped them as they simultaneously sought to be transformed by them. In Consuming Landscapes, Thomas Zeller explores how what we see while driving reflects how we view our societies and ourselves, the role that consumerism plays in our infrastructure, and ideas about reshaping the environment in the twentieth century.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Megan C. Masters: Longitudinal Studies of Second Language Learning: Quantitative Methods and Outcomes\n\nDate: March 7, 2023\n\nLongitudinal Studies of Second Language Learning: Quantitative Methods and Outcomes provides a how-to guide to choosing, using, and understanding quantitative longitudinal research and sampling methods in second and foreign language learning.\n\nThis volume will provide readers with exemplary longitudinal studies of language learning outcomes, as well as an overview of widely used methods of data analysis. Readers will understand how long-term data collection processes are organized and archived, and how the data are managed over time prior to analysis. Each of the chapters provide applied researchers with examples of how language learning outcomes gathered over time can be organized into data sets useful for insightful descriptive and inferential analyses of learning outcomes.\n\nAs the only edited volume that focuses on longitudinal data analysis specifically for a second language acquisition (SLA)/applied linguistics readership, this will be an invaluable resource for advanced students and researchers of SLA, applied linguistics, assessment, and education.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Gerrit Knaap, Rebecca Lewis, Arnab Chakraborty: Handbook on Smart Growth: Promise, Principles, and Prospects for Planning\n\nDate: December 8, 2022\n\nGerrit-Jan Knaap is Professor of Urban Studies and Planning, Executive Director of the National Center for Smart Growth Research at the University of Maryland. Knaap earned his B.S. from Willamette University, his MA and PhD from the University of Oregon, and received post-doctoral training at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, all in economics.\n\nKnaap’s research interests include the interactions between housing markets and policy, the economics and politics of land use planning, the efficacy of economic development instruments, and the impacts of environmental policy. On these subjects, Knaap has authored or coauthored over 65 articles in peer refereed journals, and coauthored or co-edited nine books. He received the Chester Rapkin award for the best paper published in Volume 10 of the Journal of Planning Education and Research, with Greg Lindsey, he received the 1998 best of ACSP award, and in 2006 he received the Outstanding Planner Award from the Maryland Chapter of the American Planning Association.\n\nWe will also hear from co-editors Rebecca Lewis, Associate Professor, Planning, Public Policy and Management, Co-Director, Institute for Policy Research and Engagement, University of Oregon, and Arnab Chakraborty, Professor of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Katy June-Freisen, Ph.D. candidate, Philip Merrill College of Journalism, Editor, National Center for Smart Growth, University of Maryland, will be available for Q and A.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Peter Grybauskas: A Sense of Tales Untold: Exploring the Edges of Tolkien’s Literary Canvas\n\nDate: April 19, 2022\n\nJoin the University Libraries for a discussion with Senior Lecturer Peter Grybauskas on his new book A Sense of Tales Untold: Exploring the Edges of Tolkien’s Literary Canvas.\n\nModerated by University Librarians (and Tolkien fans) Emily Deinert and Suzy Wilson.\n\n[From the Publisher] A Sense of Tales Untold examines the margins of J. R. R. Tolkien’s work: the frames, edges, allusions, and borders between story and un-story and the spaces between vast ages and miniscule time periods.\n\nThe untold tales that are simply implied or referenced in the text are essential to Tolkien’s achievement in world-building, Peter Grybauskas argues, and counter the common but largely spurious image of Tolkien as a writer of bloated prose. Instead, A Sense of Tales Untold highlights Tolkien’s restraint―his ability to check the pen to great effect.\n\nOn campus, Peter Grybauskas teaches primarily in the Department of English. Abroad, he leads short-term courses on Tolkien (winter-term in the UK) and on food (summer-term in Italy). His scholarship focuses on Tolkien, fantasy, and medievalism. Before coming to UMD, he taught in Italy and collaborated with the Roman Association of Tolkien Studies.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Catherine Knight Steele: Digital Black Feminism\n\nDate: April 11, 2022 [March 30, 2022?]\n\nJoin us for a virtual discussion with Dr. Catherine Knight Steele on her book Digital Black Feminism that \"traces the longstanding relationship between technology and Black feminist thought\".\n\nDr. Catherine Knight Steele is an Assistant Professor of Communication at the University of Maryland - College Park where she directs the Black Communication and Technology lab (BCaT) as a part of the Digital Inquiry, Speculation, Collaboration, & Optimism (DISCO) Network funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nHer research focuses on race, gender, and media, with a specific emphasis on African American culture and discourse in traditional and new media. She examines representations of marginalized communities in the media and how groups resist oppression and practice joy using online technology to create spaces of community.\n\nSpeaking of Digital Scholarship: Slavery, Law, and Power (SLP) Project Launch\n\nDate: February 15, 2022\n\nJoin us for the official launch of the Slavery, Law, and Power (SLP) Project [slaverylawpower.org].\n\nThis project brings renewed attention to imperial policymaking and its pivotal role in the development of slavery and racial ideologies. It explores how those interacted with local politics and policies in different colonies throughout the British Empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nSLP situates local policies and experiences into a wider, comparative framework within the interconnected landscape of slavery and the slave trade. It connects larger debates over political power to those over slavery and bound labor.\n\nIt conceives of the enslaved as political actors who influenced outcomes, even without official voices, sometimes merely in reaction to their attempts to resist. It helps to situate debates over slavery and governance that emerged during and after the American Revolution.\n\nWe aim to become an increasingly collaborative project and to encourage contributions of related manuscript materials from a range of scholars.\n\nThe project director is Holly Brewer, Burke Professor of American History and Associate Professor at the University of Maryland. She is a specialist in early American history and the early British empire as well as early modern debates about justice. Other panelists include Assistant Editors and Project Collaborators Lauren Michalak, Derek Litvak, Hannah Nolan, Jordan Sly, Matt Fischer, and the project's technical architect, Ji Kim.\n\nFor more about our team visit slaverylawpower.org/the-team.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Casey J. Dawkins: Just Housing: The Moral Foundations of American Housing Policy\n\nDate: October 12, 2021\n\nA new conception of housing justice grounded in moral principles that appeal to the home's special connection to American life.\n\nIn response to the twin crises of homelessness and housing insecurity, an emerging “housing justice” coalition argues that America's apparent inability to provide decent housing for all is a moral failing. Yet if housing is a right, as housing justice advocates contend, what is the content of that right?\n\nIn a wide-ranging examination of these issues, Casey Dawkins chronicles the concept of housing justice, investigates the moral foundations of the US housing reform tradition, and proposes a new conception of housing justice that is grounded in moral principles that appeal to the home's special connection to American life. [Read full description at MIT Press]\n\nCasey J. Dawkins is Professor of Urban Studies and Planning and Affiliate of the National Center for Smart Growth at the University of Maryland. He is coauthor of The Social Impacts of Urban Containment.

It chronicles the creation and development of Puebla de los Ángeles, a city located in central-south Mexico, during its viceregal period.\n\nFounded in 1531, the city was established as a Spanish settlement surrounded by important Indigenous towns. This situation prompted a colonial city that developed along Spanish colonial guidelines but became influenced by the native communities that settled in it, creating one of the most architecturally rich cities in colonial Spanish America, from the Renaissance to the Baroque periods. This book covers the city's historical background, investigating its civic and religious institutions as represented in selected architectural landmarks. Throughout the narrative, Burke weaves together sociological, anthropological, and historical analysis to discuss the city’s architectural and urban development.\n\nWritten for academics, students, and researchers interested in architectural history, Latin American studies, and the Spanish American viceregal period, it will make an important contribution to the field.\n\nJuan Luis Burke is Assistant Professor of Architectural and Urban History at the University of Maryland, College Park. His research is centered on Mexican and Latin American architecture and urbanism, and its interactions with Europe, particularly Italy and Spain.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Dr. Shay Hazkani: Dear Palestine\n\nDate: October 6, 2021\n\nDr. Shay Hazkani is a historian of the modern Middle East, with a particular interest in the social and cultural history of Palestine/Israel, and Middle Eastern Jews. In his research and teaching he focuses on the interactions between elites and non-elites, and how ideas which emanate from elites and state institutions were transformed and subverted as they make their way to the reflections and conduct of ordinary people.\n\nHis forthcoming book, Dear Palestine: A Social History of the 1948 War (Stanford University Press) recasts the 1948 war in Palestine through a socio-cultural history of the conflict’s ordinary actors and its transnational reverberations.[Visit full biography].\n\nSpeaking of Books with Dr. Robert S. Levine: The Failed Promise\n\nDate: September 23, 2021\n\nDr. Robert S. Levine’s new book, The Failed Promise: Reconstruction, Frederick Douglass, and the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson(W. W. Norton, 2021), tells the story of Frederick Douglass’s heated struggle with President Andrew Johnson over the rights of Black Americans in the years immediately following the Civil War. Levine recounts the conflicts that led to Johnson’s impeachment from the perspective of Douglass and the wider Black community. Douglass believed that the Union victory in the Civil War, aided by nearly 200,000 Black soldiers, meant that African Americans should gain the full rights of U.S. citizenship, including the right to vote. Sadly, Blacks and other minorities are continuing to fight for such rights. Douglass’s struggle with Johnson speaks to the promise and failure of Reconstruction, and to the struggles of our own moment as well. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., writes, “The Failed Promise is a lesson for our times as we continue to confront our nation’s unfulfilled promise of racial equality.” [Read more about The Failed Promise and Levine’s other work.]\n\nDr. Robert S. Levine is a Distinguished University Professor of English at the University of Maryland, College Park, with wide interests in 19th-century American literature and culture and a particular fascination with the life and work of Frederick Douglass.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Michael Carlos Abrams: The Art of City Sketching A Field Manual\n\nDate: September 14, 2021\n\nThe Art of City Sketching: A Field Manual guides readers through the process of freehand architectural sketching and explains orthographic, diagrammatic, three-dimensional, and perceptual-type drawings. The book presents hundreds of drawings of historic buildings and urban spaces, examples, and exercises, which help readers develop their drawing skills and employ sketching as an analytical tool.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts, based on the reader’s skill level: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. As an architect and field sketching instructor, the author shows that through drawing the reader can discover, analyze, and comprehend the built environment.\n\nMichael C. Abrams is a registered architect and an Associate Clinical Professor at the University of Maryland–College Park. He has taught design and drawing at several colleges and universities across the United States. Abrams obtained his Master of Architecture from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor and a Bachelor in Environmental Design from the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras.\n\nSpeaking of Sisters with Transistors with Lisa Rovner and Suzanne Ciani: Screening and Discussion\n\nDate: May 4, 2021\n\nJoin us for an online event featuring a screening of Sisters With Transistors, a documentary film on female pioneers of electronic music and a moderated discussion on the documentary and its subjects.\n\nThe event will be open to the public with reservations.

Williams incorporates a variety of digital technologies into his research and teaching, such as digital photogrammetry, parametric 3-D modeling, and GIS mapping.\n\nThrough careful analysis of the Romanesque cathedral of Molfetta (in Apulia, southern Italy), Williams demonstrates how the commercial boom of the medieval Mediterranean changed the way churches were funded, designed, and built. The young bishopric of Molfetta, emerging in an economy of long-distance trade, competed with much wealthier institutions in its own diocese. Funding for the cathedral was slow and unpredictable. To adapt, the builders designed toward versatility, embracing multi-functionalism, change over time, specialization, and a heterogeneous style.\n\nJoseph Williams is an Assistant Professor of Architecture at the School of Architecture, Planning and preservation. Williams holds a PhD. in Art History from Duke University. His research focuses on Romanesque architecture in Southern Italy, with an emphasis on building process, construction techniques and pan-Mediterranean exchanges of specialized knowledge.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Dr. Faedra Chatard Carpenter: Coloring Whiteness: Acts of Critique in Black Performance\n\nDate: March 3, 2020\n\nDr. Faedra Chatard Carpenter, recipient of both the Anne Warren Leadership Award (2018) from the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies and the University of Maryland’s Graduate Faculty Mentor of the Year Award (2016), is a theatre and performance studies scholar, professional dramaturg, and cultural critic.\n\nHer research, writing, public speaking, and creative activities are grounded in her advocacy for diversity, inclusion, and cultural fluency within a wide-range of institutional spheres. Through her analysis of both staged performances and the performative practices of everyday life, Dr. Carpenter applies her expertise in expressive culture, creative collaboration, and dramaturgical methodologies to forge common understandings and illuminate issues regarding race, gender, class, and sexuality.\n\nDr. Carpenter’s book, Coloring Whiteness: Acts of Critique in Black Performance (University of Michigan Press), received the Honorable Mention for ATDS’ John W. Frick Book Award for the best book in American theatre and drama in 2014 as well as the Honorable Mention for ASTR’s 2015 Errol Hill Award for outstanding scholarship in African American theater, drama, and/or performance studies.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Carpenter is working on her second book project, Crafting Consciousness. A study of creative texts, performance events, and public presentations, Crafting Consciousness explores how the particularized employment of imagery, language, and communal narratives can facilitate and foster meanings—both intended and unintended. In so doing, Dr. Carpenter uses her case studies to offer cultural insight, consider the politics of intentionality, and champion conscientious innovation on and beyond the stage.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Dr. Richard Bell: Stolen: Five Free Boys Kidnapped into Slavery and their Astonishing Odyssey Home\n\nDate: February 25, 2020\n\nRichard Bell received his PhD from Harvard University and his BA from the University of Cambridge. His research interests focus on American history between 1750 and 1877 and he welcomes enquiries from graduate students working in this period.\n\nProf. Bell’s new book is Stolen: Five Free Boys Kidnapped Into Slavery and Their Astonishing Odyssey Home. It is the recipient of a 2017 NEH Public Scholar Award and will be published by Simon & Schuster on October 8, 2019. Stolen is the true story of five boys who were kidnapped in the North and smuggled into slavery in the Deep South—and their daring attempt to escape and bring their captors to justice. In Philadelphia in 1825, these five young, free black boys fell into the clutches of the most fearsome gang of kidnappers and slavers in the United States. Lured onto a small ship with the promise of food and pay, they were instead met with blindfolds, ropes, and knives.\n\nOver four long months, their kidnappers drove them overland into the Cotton Kingdom to be sold as slaves. Determined to resist, the boys formed a tight brotherhood as they struggled to free themselves and find their way home. Their ordeal—an odyssey that took them from the Philadelphia waterfront to the marshes of Mississippi and then onward still—shines a glaring spotlight on the Reverse Underground Railroad, a black-market network of human traffickers and slave traders who stole away thousands of legally free African Americans from their families in order to fuel slavery’s rapid expansion in the decades before the Civil War.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Diane L. Dixon: Diversity on the Executive Path\n\nDate: February 18, 2020\n\nThe population that healthcare organizations serve is becoming increasingly diverse. However, racially and ethnically diverse executive leaders in healthcare remain underrepresented.\n\nIn Diversity on the Executive Path: Wisdom and Insights for Navigating to the Highest Levels of Healthcare Leadership, author Diane L. Dixon, EdD, shares the real-life experiences of 12 racially and ethnically diverse hospital and health system CEOs.\n\nShe conducted in-depth, face-to-face interviews to discover what it takes to become a leader at the highest level.

Now in a position of power the descendants of the slain miners have themselves become rabidly anti-union and anti-immigrant as Dominicans and other Latinos change the community.\n\nShackel shows how the social, economic, and political circumstances surrounding historic Lattimer connect in profound ways to the riven communities today.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Mary Corbin Sies and Isabelle Gournay: Iconic Planned Communities and the Challenge of Change\n\nDate: October 24, 2019\n\nIn the history of planning, the design of an entire community prior to its construction is among the oldest traditions.

Zero operating energy? Zero energy costs? Zero emissions? There is no one answer: approaches to net zero building vary widely across the globe and are influenced by different environmental and cultural contexts.\n\nNet Zero Energy Building: Predicted and Unintended Consequences presents a comprehensive overview of variations in 'net zero' building practices. Drawing on examples from countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and China, Ming Hu examines diverse approaches to net zero and reveals their intended and unintended consequences.\n\nMing Hu is an Assistant Professor at School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, University of Maryland, College Park, affiliate faculty in the National Center for Smart Growth and Maryland Transportation Institute.

Ruth Enid Zambrana finds that despite the changing demographics of the nation, the percentages of Black and Hispanic faculty have increased only slightly, while the percentages obtaining tenure and earning promotion to full professor have remained relatively stagnant. Toxic Ivory Towers is the first book to take a look at the institutional factors impacting the ability of URM faculty to be successful at their jobs, and to flourish in academia. The book captures not only how various dimensions of identity inequality are expressed in the academy and how these social statuses influence the health and well-being of URM faculty, but also how institutional policies and practices can be used to transform the culture of an institution to increase rates of retention and promotion so URM faculty can thrive.\n\nRuth Enid Zambrana, Ph.D., is Professor in the University of Maryland Department of Women’s Studies, Director of the Consortium on Race, Gender and Ethnicity and Adjunct Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Medicine.\n\nSpeaking of Books with Anne Farris Rosen: Deep South Dispatch: Memoir of a Civil Rights Journalist\n\nDate: April 9, 2019\n\nAnne Farris Rosen, adjunct professor at Philip Merrill College of Journalism, has been a journalist since 1980, specializing in coverage of politics, government, legal affairs and social issues at the international, national and local levels.

The book explores how Arab women have been engaging in three ongoing, parallel struggles, before, during, and after the Arab Spring: the political struggle to pave the road for democracy, freedom, and reform; the social struggle to achieve gender equality and fight all forms of injustice and discrimination against women; and the legal struggle to chart new laws which can safeguard both the political and the social gains.\n\nThe contributors argue that while the political upheavals were oftentimes more prevalent and visible, they should not overshadow the parallel social and legal revolutions which are equally important, due to their long-term impacts on the region. The chapters shed light on the intersections, overlaps and divergences between these simultaneous, continuous gendered struggles and unpacks their complexities and multiple implications, locally, regionally, and internationally, across different countries and through different phases.\n\nSpeaking of Books: Valerie Orlando: The Algerian New Novel: The Poetics of a Modern Nation\n\nDate: March 8, 2018\n\nValerie Orlando, Professor of French & Francophone Literatures and Head of the Department of French & Italian, presents her book, The Algerian New Novel: The Poetics of a Modern Nation, 1950-1979 on March 8, 2018 in McKeldin Library, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.\n\nThe Algerian New Novel shows how Algerian authors writing in French actively contributed to the experimental forms of the period. Although their themes were rooted in Algeria, the avant-garde writing styles of these authors were influenced by early 20th-century American modernists, the New Novelists of the 1940s-50s France, and African American authors of the 1950s-60s. This complex mix of influences led Algerian writers to develop a unique modern literary aesthetic to express their world, a tradition of experimentation and fragmentation that still characterizes the work of contemporary Algerian francophone writers.\n\nSpeaking of Books: Campbell F. Scribner: The Fight for Local Control\n\nDate: February 15, 2018\n\nCampbell F.

Nancy Mirabal delves into a rich cache of primary sources, archival documents, literary texts, club records, newspapers, photographs, and oral histories to show how Cubans were authors of their own experiences, organizing movements, publishing texts, and establishing important political, revolutionary, and social clubs.\n\nSpeaking of Books: Matthew Kirschenbaum: Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing\n\nDate: November 2, 2016\n\nThe story of writing in the digital age is every bit as messy as the ink-stained rags that littered the floor of Gutenberg’s print shop or the hot molten lead of the Linotype machine. During the period of the pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology, some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous interviews conducted by the author, Track Changes is the first literary history of word processing.\n\nMatthew Kirschenbaum is Distinguished University Professor in the Department of English at the University of Maryland. He is also an affiliated faculty member with the College of Information Studies at Maryland and a member of the teaching faculty at the University of Virginia’s Rare Book School.

The life course trajectories of seventy individuals and their networks, organized chronologically to include life in the country of origin, the journey, and settlement in the county, frame migration as social issue rather than social problem. Having internalized the American dream, immigrants toil to achieve upward social mobility while constructing an immigrant space that nurtures well-being. This book demonstrates that an immigrant’s experience is grounded in personal, social, economic, and political spheres of influence, and reflects the complexity of migrants’ stories to help demystify homogenous categorization.\n\nSpeaking of Books: Henry C. Lucas, Jr. : Technology & the Disruption of Higher Education\n\nDate: April 7, 2016\n\nWill half of universities fail in the next 15 years?

From 1897 to 1917 the red-light district of Storyville commercialized and even thrived on New Orleans's longstanding reputation for sin and sexual excess. This notorious neighborhood, located just outside of the French Quarter, hosted a diverse cast of characters who reflected the cultural milieu and complex social structure of turn-of-the-century New Orleans, a city infamous for both prostitution and interracial intimacy.
