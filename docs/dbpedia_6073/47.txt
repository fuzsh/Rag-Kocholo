David Cameron was born in 1966 and attended Eton College and Oxford University. He became the Member of Parliament for Witney in Oxfordshire in 2001. Four years later he was elected leader of the Conservative Party where he implemented a programme of modernisation.

After the 2010 election he became Prime Minister of a coalition government, which turned around the UK economy and radically reformed public services. In 2015 he won the first outright Conservative majority for 23 years. A year later, he resigned after the referendum he called on Britainâ€™s membership of the European Union resulted in a vote to leave.
