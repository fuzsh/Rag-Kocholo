        "text": "Introduction\n\n1Until the late 1980, Britain’s Conservative Party enjoyed a reputation for public unity, rejection of ideology, pragmatism, deference among MPs towards its leaders, and governmental competence, attributes which underpinned its renowned ‘statecraft’, and remarkable electoral success. However, from the late 1980s onwards, the Conservative Party has been prone to often deep and damaging disagreements and divisions over Britain’s relationship with the European Community (EC), and then the European Union (EU), with a growing number of MPs questioning the need for UK membership of the EU. This reflected and reinforced a change in the nature of intra-Party divisions over EU membership, for whereas internal disagreements had previously been between Europhiles (pro-Europeans) and Eurosceptics, the 21st century has seen the emergence of a new division, between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ Eurosceptics.\n\n2Cameron’s difficulties in managing intra-Party dissent over Europe were exacerbated by the increasing popularity and media coverage enjoyed by the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), led by the charismatic and populist Nigel Farage. Although UKIP was not expected to win many (if any) seats in House of Commons, it was deemed likely to win enough votes in some constituencies to deprive the Conservative candidate of a plurality of votes, and therefore allow the Labour or Liberal Democrat candidate to claim victory. It was in the context of these developments that Cameron announced, in January 2013, a referendum on the UK’s continued membership of the EU, although this would not be held until after the next general election, scheduled for 2015. In the meantime, Cameron – as a ‘soft’ Eurosceptic – intended to renegotiate the UK’s membership of the EU, in the expectation of reclaiming some powers, and thereby establishing a looser, more flexible, relationship with Europe. He would then urge people to vote for the UK to ‘Remain’ a member of the EU. It was to prove a disastrous strategy, a monumental miscalculation.\n\nCameron’s initial intention to neutralise the EU issue\n\n5During the first half (2005-2010) of Cameron’s leadership, when the Conservatives were not in government, the most contentious issue vis-à-vis the EU concerned the Lisbon Treaty, which he initially insisted should be subject to a referendum prior to the UK’s ratification. This claim, though, was primarily prompted by the necessity of intra-party management, with Cameron hoping that the allusion to a referendum on ratification would pacify the Conservatives’ more vehement and vocal Eurosceptics, and enable him to focus on the Party’s domestic policy agenda. However, in November 2009, Cameron abandoned the referendum pledge, because by this time, other EU member-states had ratified the Lisbon Treaty. In so doing, Cameron insisted that: ‘We cannot hold a referendum and magically make…the Lisbon treaty…disappear, any more than we could hold a referendum to stop the sun rising in the morning’\n\n6This announcement alerted many Conservative Eurosceptics to the risk that Cameron would prove unreliable in resisting further European integration if he became Prime Minister. In an attempt at allaying such concerns, Cameron offered another pledge, via the Conservatives’ 2010 manifesto, that ‘in future, the British people must have their say on any transfer of powers to the European Union…any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power, or competences, would be subject to a referendum.’ This was another clear attempt at agenda-management and attention-deflection by attempting to downgrade a contentious issue, but when Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010, three factors significantly enhanced the saliency of the EU as a policy issue, thereby exacerbating divisions in the Conservative Party and posing serious problems for Cameron’s leadership.\n\nCameron’s failure to lead the Conservatives to victory in 2010\n\n9Cameron did attempt to pacify these critics by withdrawing the Conservative Party from the (moderate) centre-Right European People’s Party bloc in the European Parliament, but in so doing, he alienated some of the key leaders from other member states whose support he would later need in attempting to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the UK’s membership. In effect, short-term intra-party management was to have longer-term repercussions which Cameron probably could not have envisaged when responding tactically to backbench discontent over ‘the European question’.\n\nThe Changing Character of Conservative Euroscepticism\n\n10The second factor which greatly enhanced the significance of the EU as an issue within Cameron’s Conservative Party was the character of the division over Europe during his premiership. Under the previous two Conservative Prime Ministers, Margaret Thatcher (1979-90) and John Major (1990-97), the main distinction had been between Europhiles (pro-Europeans or Euro-enthusiasts) and Eurosceptics. The latter viewed EU membership in neo-liberal terms; free trade between member-states, the post-1992 single market, and promoting competition and de-regulation. However, they were strongly opposed both to further integration or harmonisation – including the single European currency - and to the EU’s increasing jurisdiction over other policy spheres, such as employment rights, the environment, and social justice.\n\nThe emergence of UKIP as an electoral threat\n\n19The third development which increased pressure on Cameron over the issue of Europe was the increasing popularity of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which campaigned explicitly for the UK’s total and permanent withdrawal from the EU. The issue had actually been of low electoral salience in the 2010s, not because of any widespread love of the EU among the British people, but because the electorate had not previously judged EU withdrawal to be an important issue compared to the economy, the NHS, education, pensions, crime, etc. Indeed, in the 2010 general election, it had only been ranked 10th when voters were asked to rate policy issues in terms of their electoral importance. Many voters would endorse the UK’s withdrawal from the EU if presented with a simple binary choice (leave or remain) in an opinion poll or public attitudes survey, but relatively few voters felt sufficiently strongly about the EU to rate it as the most important issue facing either themselves or the country. This clearly posed a political dilemma for a supposedly ‘single issue’ party like UKIP.\n\n21The second factor which boosted UKIP’s popularity after 2010 was the manner in which Farage linked withdrawal from the EU to the issue of immigration, particularly migrant workers who worked in Britain under the auspices of the ‘free movement of labour’. Farage had recognised that campaigning against UK membership of the EU solely on constitutional grounds (the loss of sovereignty, and supranationalism) would only attract limited support, because these were rather abstract or esoteric issues to many voters; they were too technocratic. What was needed, he reasoned, was to identify a particular issue which was tangible, could be portrayed as problematic, arguably affected many people and communities, and was directly attributable to membership of the EU. By identifying migrant workers, especially those from East European countries which had joined the EU in 2004 and 2007, as a ‘problem’, Farage imbued the campaign for UK withdrawal with an emotional and visceral appeal, against which evidence-based counter-arguments by mainstream politicians, particularly about the ‘benefits’ of immigration and multiculturalism, often had limited appeal or impact.\n\n23The material deprivation and suffering in these communities were compounded by more general economic changes in parts of the UK since the 1990s. In many towns in Northern England and South Wales, which had once thrived due to industries such as coal, steel, ship-building and textiles, local people often felt that they had been ‘left behind’ by globalisation and the automation of many jobs, but had not benefitted from the expansion, since the 1980s, of new white-collar and professional jobs in sectors such as financial services, Information Technology, and ‘creative industries’; many of these were based in the already prosperous south of England and London. Instead, many of the jobs which either remained, or were created, in the ‘left behind’ towns, were insecure, low-paid, had unsocial hours and poor working conditions; they were characterised by poverty wages and precarious employment contracts. This lack of secure or well-paid employment, combined with the decimation of public services and lack of affordable housing, meant that Farage and UKIP found it relatively easy to persuade some of these ‘left behind’ and impoverished citizens that their immiseration was caused by the EU, and migrant workers either ‘taking their jobs’ or ‘driving-down’ wages, while also adding to the pressures on already over-stretched public services and housing.\n\nCameron’s referendum pledge\n\n27Cameron however, could point to the fact that there had been a referendum on EEC membership back in 1975, and that such a poll was thus not unprecedented. Also, given that this referendum had been almost 40 years ago, Cameron could argue that the time was right to allow the UK people to be given another opportunity to express their views on continued membership of the EU, especially as there had been so many changes since 1975. Besides, the Cameron’s Government had already allowed a referendum on electoral reform, in which his campaign against adopting the Alternative Vote method of election had proved victorious. Cameron would also hold a referendum on whether Scotland should be allowed to become independent, and his advocacy of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom (i.e., rejecting a ‘leave’ vote) also proved successful. These two victories were very likely to have boosted Cameron’s confidence that he could lead ‘Remain’ to victory in a referendum on the UK’s continued EU membership, and thereby ‘settle the question’ for a generation. Indeed, this confidence – what proved to be over-confidence or hubris – was strengthened by two other factors at the time he pledged an EU referendum.\n\n28The first were opinion polls which asked people how they would vote if Cameron could negotiate a ‘better deal’ for the UK, and then recommended a vote to remain in the EU. Although many polls offered respondents a simple binary choice between Leave and Remain – with Leave often the slightly more popular choice – there was a different response when people were asked how they would vote on the basis of successfully renegotiated terms and conditions of UK membership. For example, a YouGov poll, conducted at the end of 2013, offered respondents three options, and each attracted significantly different responses, as illustrated by Table 1.\n\nScenarios\n\nWould vote Leave\n\nWould vote Remain\n\nConservative supporter – would vote Leave\n\nConservative supporter – would vote Remain\n\nNo renegotiation\n\n45\n\n32\n\n62\n\n22\n\nModest renegotiation\n\n38\n\n39\n\n47\n\n38\n\nMajor renegotiation\n\n23\n\n52\n\n21\n\n63\n\n29The clear message to Cameron was that if he could secure a major renegotiation of the UK’s membership, entailing the return of various powers to Parliament, then there would be a 52/23 majority in favour of the UK remaining in the EU, whereas if he failed to obtain any changes, the UK public would vote 45/32 to Leave. The same poll also revealed that whereas Conservative supporters would vote 62/22 to Leave the EU if there was no change in the terms of the UK’s membership, these Conservatives would vote 63/21 for the UK to Remain in the EU if Cameron secured a major renegotiation. It seemed that much of the public, and also many Conservative supporters, were ‘soft’ Eurosceptics – it was not the UK’s membership of the EU itself that they objected to, but the current (perceived) imbalance of power and erosion of parliamentary sovereignty. If the terms and conditions of UK membership could be significantly recalibrated, thus yielding a looser, more flexible, relationship, then there would be majority support among the UK public in general, and Conservative voters in particular.\n\n32This, in turn, made it difficult for Cameron (and Remain campaigners in the referendum) to persuade ‘soft’ Eurosceptics voters that he had secured substantive and durable reforms from other EU leaders. On the contrary, the limited reforms he attained convinced many people that Cameron himself was a weak leader who was incapable of ‘standing up for’ the UK’s interests in Europe, and/or that the EU itself was incapable of reform, or at least reformed in the manner that would benefit the UK. Thus did the June 2016 referendum see 17.4 million people vote Leave, while 16.1 million supported Remain – 52-48% of votes cast respectively, on a turnout of 72%. In spite of the relatively narrow margin of their victory, Leave supporters immediately insisted that the referendum result was emphatic, and represented ‘the democratic will of the British people’ – a claim repeated consistently ever since.\n\nWhy Cameron and the ‘Remain’ campaign lost the 2016 Referendum\n\nThe emotional/visceral appeal of the ‘Leave’ campaign\n\n34Much of the success of ‘hard’ Eurosceptics in campaigning for Britain’s withdrawal from the EU derived from their ability to simplify the issues via short and simple slogans - ‘take back control’ was a notable example - and appeal to people’s emotions or gut-instincts in denouncing EU bureaucracy, immigration and a European ‘super-state’. By contrast, ‘Remainers’ had assumed that the case for the UK’s continued membership of the EU could be made largely by appealing to ‘facts’, logic, reason, and economic criteria – citing the volume of trade with Europe, and the damage that would be caused to the UK’s economy by withdrawing. However, the Remain campaign’s economic claims lacked the simplicity and visceral appeal of anti-European (sometimes xenophobic) arguments and sentiments.\n\n36Indeed, Leave supporters concluded that the economic and social problems which their towns suffered were clear evidence of the irrelevance of the EU; what the Remain campaign claimed were the valuable benefits of EU membership were a source of mystification to many Leave voters, and seemed to confirm that ‘Remainers’ were out-of-touch with the painful experiences of much of the UK. If Remainers insisted that the EU had not caused the socio-economic problems endured by the ‘left behind’, the Leave campaign could retort that the EU had done little, or nothing, to prevent or alleviate such problems, but had certainly made them worse via the ‘free movement of labour’.\n\nThe socio-economic and demographic characteristics of many ‘Leave’ voters\n\n38One of the most notable aspects of the UK’s referendum on EU membership was the extent to which support for Leave/Remain corresponded closely to different sections of British society, as illustrated in Table 2.\n\nVoted ‘Leave’\n\nVoted ‘Remain’\n\nAge\n\n18-24\n\n25\n\n75\n\n25-34\n\n40\n\n60\n\n35-44\n\n35\n\n55\n\n45-54\n\n56\n\n44\n\n55-64\n\n61\n\n39\n\n65-74\n\n66\n\n34\n\n75+\n\n63\n\n37\n\nSex/Gender\n\nMale\n\n55\n\n45\n\nFemale\n\n49\n\n51\n\nSocial class/employment status\n\nAB (professional/managerial)\n\n41\n\n59\n\nC1 (Middle class)\n\n48\n\n52\n\nC2 (Skilled working class\n\n62\n\n38\n\nDE (semi-skilled/unskilled)\n\n64\n\n36\n\nUnemployed\n\n60\n\n40\n\nStudent\n\n20\n\n80\n\nRetired\n\n64\n\n36\n\nEducational attainment\n\nNo qualifications\n\n70\n\n30\n\nGSCE/Diploma/A-Level\n\n44\n\n56\n\nDegree\n\n32\n\n68\n\nParty supported in 2015 election\n\nConservative\n\n59\n\n41\n\nLabour\n\n36\n\n64\n\nLiberal Democrat\n\n31\n\n69\n\n40Meanwhile, there is a clear correlation between class and educational attainment; workers in ‘manual’ or ‘unskilled’ occupations are unlikely to have attended university – for most of them, a degree has not been viewed as necessary or worthwhile for their jobs. There also seems to be a widespread anti-intellectualism among much of the English working class, which further fosters the view that a university education is unimportant, unnecessary, and over-valued. It is notable that, on Facebook, for example, many Brexiters’ ‘bios’ boast ‘the School of Hard Knocks, and the University of Life’.\n\nThe cultural and populist aspect of the Leave vote\n\n42The demographic ‘divide’ apparent in the support for Brexit has also reflected and reinforced another feature of contemporary UK politics, namely the increasingly bitter ‘culture war’. As noted earlier, many of those who voted Leave did so because they wanted to stop immigration via the ‘free movement of labour’. By leaving the EU, they wanted the UK to ‘take back control’ of its borders – a manifestation of sovereignty.\n\n44These Leave-supporting ‘culture war’ warriors thus exude an ostensibly paradoxical blend of libertarianism and authoritarianism. They apparently want to restore the freedom-of-speech that ‘political correctness’ and the ‘fascist Left’ are accused of having suppressed, and also revive the liberties allegedly destroyed by both Brussels, and the UK’s ‘nanny state’ – many of them have been opposed to COVID Lockdowns and being required to wear face-masks, and also still resent the ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants which was introduced in 2007 (to prevent ‘passive smoking’). To a large degree, many Brexiters exude a strong sense of victimhood, believing themselves to have been oppressed or persecuted by curbs on their lives and freedom-of-speech: what they often mean when complaining about limits on their free-speech is that they feel unable to use racist, sexist or the homophobic language, due to ‘political correctness’ – they want to be able to make derogatory of offensive remarks about people they do not like, or who they consider to be inferior to them, without suffering any sanctions.\n\nConclusion\n\n49Having fatally undermined Margaret Thatcher’s and John Major’s premierships, the issue of the EU subsequently destroyed David Cameron’s, and then Theresa May’s after him; four successive Conservative Prime Ministers were unable to resolve their Party’s disagreements and divisions over the UK’s relationship with the EU. Indeed, under Cameron’s leadership, the nature of the division itself had changed enormously, from intra-party debates about the nature of the UK’s membership (more integration and ‘ever closer union’, or maintain the status quo by resisting any further widening or deepening), to internal arguments about whether the UK should renegotiate the terms of its membership in order to secure a looser, more flexible, relationship, or withdraw from the EU altogether.\n\n50Cameron and about two-thirds of the parliamentary Conservative Party favoured the former option, and having felt unable to resist the increasing political pressure for a referendum – in the context of repeated demands and dissent by ‘hard’ Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, and growing electoral support for UKIP – he was confident that he could successfully undertake such a renegotiation, whereupon he would recommend a ‘Remain’ (in the EU) vote in the subsequent plebiscite. However, Cameron’s inability to achieve the reforms, and reclamation of powers, that he had originally envisaged, had the effect of persuading many Conservative MPs, and sections of the British public, that either Cameron was a weak leader unable to defend the UK’s interests in the EU, or that the EU was so institutionally intransigent and integrationist that it could not be reformed – at least, not in the manner than the UK wanted.\n\n51As a consequence, Cameron and the ‘Remain’ campaign struggled to offer voters a positive narrative in the referendum, beyond arguing that Britain had benefitted from immigration. Much of the Remain campaign focused on the alleged economic costs of withdrawal, in terms of diminished trade, higher prices and job losses. Yet these somewhat esoteric or technocratic arguments struggled to compete against the much more emotive and visceral counter-arguments of the Leave campaign, which invoked simple three-word slogans, and emphasised that leaving the EU would both restore the sovereignty of Parliament, and enable the UK to stop migrant workers from undermining the jobs and wages of indigenous workers.\n\n52Yet what has become evident since the referendum is that for many Leave supporters – most of them older, less-educated, in low-paid or insecure employment, and living in economically and socially ‘deprived’ towns – Brexit has acquired a wider significance than commentators and critics realised at the time of the referendum. Brexit has become a symbol of a wider ‘culture war’ by those who feel ‘left behind’ by modern society and globalisation, and have experienced feelings of alienation and anomie. Rather than blame their plight and insecurity on neo-liberalism or the Conservatives’ austerity policies, many Brexiters have identified other ‘enemies’ against whom to target their anger and frustrations – liberals, the Left, feminism, Muslims, universities (Marxist academics indoctrinating innocent young people, allegedly via ‘soft’ degrees), civil servants, the House of Lords, BBC, political-correctness, Black Lives Matter, environmentalists, experts, and ‘the Establishment’. In scapegoating these people and institutions, Brexiters have received enthusiastic encouragement from Conservatives eager to deflect attention from their own ideological bankruptcy and policy failures."
