        "text": "LONDON — David Cameron, who quit as British prime minister after the country voted to leave the European Union, on Monday announced he will be resigning as a member of parliament.\n\nGoing back on an earlier commitment to stay in the House of Commons, Cameron said he would be standing down from his constituency seat of Witney in Oxfordshire with “immediate effect.”\n\nCameron had been expected to serve out the rest of the parliamentary term as a backbench MP.\n\nBut speaking in his constituency Monday, Cameron said he would have found it “very difficult if not impossible” to carry out his work as an MP without being an “enormous distraction and diversion” from the work of the government.\n\nHe said he had informed Theresa May, the new prime minister, of his decision and received her support.\n\nBefore the Brexit vote, Cameron had planned to stay on as prime minister until shortly before the 2020 general election. He told a radio station in Oxfordshire in March that it was “very much my intention” to continue as an MP beyond 2020.\n\nHis decision comes days after May launched her first major policy offensive, with a call for the expansion of selective schools — a direction that Cameron was opposed to.\n\nAsked whether his decision was a snub to May, Cameron told reporters: “Obviously I’m going to have my own views about different issues, people know that and that’s really the point. As a former prime minister it is very difficult to sit as a backbencher and not be an enormous distraction and diversion from what the government is doing.”\n\nHowever, Cameron said he fully supported May’s premiership, adding that she had “got off to a great start.”\n\nPaying tribute to his local party and constituents, he said he would continue to live in the area.\n\n“I’m going to have to build a life outside Westminster,” he said. “I hope I’ll continue to contribute in terms of public service and contribute to this country that I love so much.”\n\nIn a statement issued in response to Cameron’s resignation, May said the Conservatives had “achieved great things” under his leadership.\n\n“His commitment to lead a one nation government is one that I will continue – and I thank him for everything he has done for the Conservative party and the country,” she said.\n\nFormer Chancellor George Osborne, Cameron’s closest political ally and, until the Brexit vote, the favorite to succeed him, paid tribute to his “great friend.”\n\n“We came into Parliament together, had a great partnership + I will miss him alongside me on the green benches over the coming years. Sad day” he posted on Twitter."
