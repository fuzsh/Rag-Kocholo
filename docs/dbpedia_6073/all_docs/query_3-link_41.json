        "text": "David Cameron's national security adviser has been appointed as Britain's next ambassador to Washington.\n\nSir Kim Darroch, a career diplomat, has spent three years advising the Prime Minister on security issues from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the rise of the Islamic state.\n\nHe was also involved in efforts to secure compensation from Libya for the victims of IRA terrorism sponsored by the Gaddafi regime.\n\nSir Kim will take over as ambassador to the United States, one of British diplomacy's most senior positions, in January 2016. \"I look forward to advancing the UK’s bilateral relationship with the United States – our greatest ally and most steadfast friend,” he said.\n\nThe 61-year-old will arrive in Washington in the midst of the US presidential election, which will take place in November next year.\n\nOne of his key tasks will be to build up a relationship with the new US president, who will succeed Barack Obama in January 2017.\n\nSir Kim is taking over from Sir Peter Westmacott, who is retiring from the diplomatic service.\n\nSir Peter took office in 2012. He has been deeply involved in international efforts to convince the US Congress not to scupper the Iran agreement."
