        "text": "Why you should listen\n\nDavid Cameron became the prime minster of the United Kingdom in May 2010, leading a coalition government (the UK's first since World War II). He was elected leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005, and has been a Member of Parliament for the Witney constituency since 2001. Before he became an MP, he was a Special Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and then to the Home Secretary. He took a break to work in media for seven years, then stood for election in 2001 on an agenda of tax-cutting. (During the election, he also wrote a column for the Guardian.) As a new MP, he took several controversial positions, such as coming out in favor of the \"harm reduction\" drug policy. He became a member of the shadow cabinet (an alternative cabinet to the party in power) in 2003, and two years later became head of the party."
