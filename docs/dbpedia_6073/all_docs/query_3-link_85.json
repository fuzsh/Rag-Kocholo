        "text": "David William Donald Cameron, Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton (born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. He served as Leader of the Opposition from 2005 to 2010, and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016. He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies.\n\nCameron studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, gaining a first class honours degree. He then joined the Conservative Research Department and became Special Adviser to Norman Lamont, and then to Michael Howard. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at Carlton Communications for seven years.\n\nA first candidacy for Parliament at Stafford in 1997 ended in defeat but Cameron was elected in 2001 as the Member of Parliament for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney. He was promoted to the Opposition front bench two years later, and rose rapidly to become head of policy coordination during the 2005 general election campaign.\n\nCameron was viewed by some as a young, moderate candidate, who would appeal to young voters, and in 2005 he won the Conservative leadership election. His early leadership saw the Conservative Party establish an opinion poll lead over Tony Blair's Labour; the first in over ten years. Although they fell behind shortly thereafter when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, under Cameron's leadership the Conservatives were consistently ahead of Labour in the polls, as shown in their 2010 electoral victory.\n\nAfter the vote to leave the European Union in the referendum on British membership, Cameron, who was campaigning to remain, announced his intention to resign as prime minister and Conservative leader on 24 June 2016. This resignation took effect on July 13 2016, and he was succeeded by Theresa May.\n\nIn November 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appointed Cameron foreign secretary and recommended him for a life peerage. Lord Cameron became the first former prime minister to be appointed to a ministerial post since Alec Douglas-Home in 1970.\n\nAlternate versions of David Cameron have been discovered throughout the multiverse:"
