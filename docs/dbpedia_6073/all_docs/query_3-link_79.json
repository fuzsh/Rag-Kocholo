        "text": "Kent MP Laura Trott has received one of the top jobs in Rishi Sunak's reshuffle. The Prime Minister made some big changes to his Cabinet after sacking Home Secretary Suella Braverman following a string of incendiary statements.\n\nOne big change includes the dramatic return of David Cameron, whose referendum sparked Brexit, to the frontline as Foreign Secretary. The former prime minister replaced James Cleverly and will be given a peerage.\n\nAfter Braverman was sacked this morning, she said “it has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary”, adding: “I will have more to say in due course.”\n\nRead more: How David Cameron can be Foreign Secretary when he is not an MP\n\nRead more: Calls grow for a General Election after Cabinet reshuffle\n\nRishi Sunak took action following her unauthorised article criticising the way pro-Palestinian protests had been policed. A No 10 source said the Prime Minister “asked Suella Braverman to leave Government and she has accepted”.\n\nKent MP Laura Trott MBE, who is MP for Sevenoaks, has received a different top job in the reshuffle. She has been appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nShe is no longer in the DWP as Pensions Minister - her first government post at the time - and instead is moving over to the Treasury to take on one of the most important and influential financial positions.\n\nShe was first elected as the Conservative MP for Sevenoaks in December 2019. She was previously a special advisor to David Cameron - the new (sort of) home Foreign Secretary.\n\nNew Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron said: “We are facing a daunting set of international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East. At this time of profound global change, it has rarely been more important for this country to stand by our allies, strengthen our partnerships and make sure our voice is heard.\n\n“While I have been out of front-line politics for the last seven years, I hope that my experience – as Conservative leader for 11 years and prime minister for six – will assist me in helping the Prime Minister to meet these vital challenges. Britain is a truly international country. Our people live all over the world and our businesses trade in every corner of the globe.\n\n“Working to help ensure stability and security on the global stage is both essential and squarely in our national interest. International security is vital for our domestic security. Though I may have disagreed with some individual decisions, it is clear to me that Rishi Sunak is a strong and capable Prime Minister, who is showing exemplary leadership at a difficult time.”\n\nMrs Braverman had been under fire for inflaming tensions after she last week branded pro-Palestinian protesters “hate marchers” and accused police of bias for allowing the rally coinciding with remembrance events to go ahead. She also recently suggested being homeless was a ‘lifestyle choice’ and said she wanted to ban charities from giving out tents.\n\nLabour MP Jess Phillips said: \"Braverman was worst Home Secretary in living memory. Putting aside obvious ghoulish divisions, she simply didn't understand her job, she didn't do anything to show even a jot of priority to domestic &sexual abuse, she made modern slavery easier for slavers and harmed policing.\"\n\nSpeaking before the Cameron appointment commentator Jim Pickard commentator said: \"If David Cameron is made foreign secretary it will be a remarkable come-back given his role at the centre of the biggest lobbying scandal in modern UK history.\"\n\nHealth minister Neil O’Brien announced that he is stepping down. One of the responsibilities Mr O’Brien had in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) was for tobacco and addiction.\n\nHe was due to play a key role in delivering Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s effective ban on smoking and vaping in the younger generation. Tweeting a picture of a child’s arts-and-crafts style sheep, the Harborough MP wrote: “It’s been a privilege to serve at DHSC.\n\n“Great ministerial team and spads (special advisers) and some fab officials. But with so much going on locally I want to focus 100% on constituency work so have asked to go to back benches. I’m also keen to see more of our two small children (artwork attached).”\n\nNews of Mrs Braverman’s exit came as defence minister James Heappey was touring broadcast studios. Minutes before she was sacked, he had told LBC that Mr Sunak and his team in No 10 had been “very clear she (Mrs Braverman) has his confidence and, in that sense, one would imagine that she will continue”.\n\nBut he was told on air during an ITV Good Morning Britain interview that she had been sacked, leaving him to say: “Your viewers will be enjoying my discomfort, but it is in this case difficult to offer commentary when I just don’t know what is going on.”\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: “Suella Braverman was never fit to be Home Secretary. Rishi Sunak knew this and he still appointed her. It was the Prime Minister’s sheer cowardice that kept her in the job even for this long. We are witnessing a broken party and a broken Government, both of which are breaking this country.”"
