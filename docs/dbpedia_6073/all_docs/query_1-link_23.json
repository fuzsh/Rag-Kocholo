        "text": "David Cameron has stepped down as an MP after 15 years saying that he does not want his presence on the Conservative backbenches to serve as a “distraction” to Theresa May.\n\nThe previous Conservative leader, who has ended his career in Westminster politics just two months after leaving Downing Street, hinted that he did not want people to pore over any differences in opinion between himself and his prime ministerial successor. His departure will trigger a byelection in his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire.\n\nAsked about whether his decision opened up the possibility that he was “snubbing” May, Cameron said he thought she had got off to a “cracking start”, before conceding: “Obviously I have my own views about certain issues. People know that. That’s really the point. As a former PM it’s very difficult to sit as a backbencher and not be an enormous diversion and distraction from what the government is doing. I don’t want to be that distraction.”\n\nHe denied that his decision was linked to the controversial policy to increase the number of grammar schools, an idea that he has spoken against in the past and that has caused concern among many education experts, opposition politicians and even a number of Conservative MPs.\n\nCameron said there were “many good things in the policy”, and that he had not meant for his decision to come on the same day that the new government introduced a consultation paper on the school policy. “This decision has got nothing to do with any one individual issue and that way the timing, I promise, is coincidental,” he told ITV news, adding that the reason was a “bigger picture” issue.\n\n“I support Theresa May. I think she’s got off to a great start. I think she can be a strong prime minister for our country ... I wish her well, I wish the government well.”\n\nCameron, who would be earning £74,962 for his work as an MP rather than the £143,462 current salary for being prime minister, did not announce details of what he would do next but spoke of hoping to “still contribute in terms of public service and to the country”. He said he would “start to build a life outside Westminster” and noted “I’m only 49”.\n\nThere was immediate speculation that he could earn considerable sums if he followed the path of predecessors, including Tony Blair, to take corporate money from directorships, lucrative book deals and speechmaking.\n\nMinisters that step down have a period of two years after their resignation in which they would need to seek approval from an advisory committee on any paid or unpaid appointments if they want to take any corporate roles.\n\nCameron did say that his decision was linked to the country opting for Brexit. “The country made a decision,” he said, “a decision I advised against, but nonetheless the decision has been made and I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and get it right. As a result, not being a backbencher but leaving parliament is the right thing to do.”\n\nMay praised her predecessor, saying: “I was proud to serve in David Cameron’s government and under his leadership we achieved great things. Not just stabilising the economy but also making great strides in delivering serious social reform. His commitment to leading a one-nation government is one that I will continue. I thank him for everything he has done for the Conservative party and the country and I wish him and his family well for the future.”\n\nThe Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he wished David Cameron “all the best for the future”, adding he got on well with him on a “human level’’.\n\nIn his interview with ITV, the former prime minister said he had thought long and hard over the summer before deciding that it was right to stand down as member of parliament for Witney. “There will be a byelection. I will give the Conservative candidate my full support,” he added.\n\nAn ally of Cameron argued that his decision to step down was not meant to be a statement about May’s policies, but rather a move that would support the new Conservative leader.\n\nThey said the “speed of events” following the referendum prevented him from making this decision straight away, and he wanted to spend the summer considering his future. They added that Cameron would be focusing on “causes close to his heart”, including the anti-corruption agenda, transparency on aid, fighting dementia, schooling and life chances.\n\nCritics of May’s government have suggested that she has shifted to the right from Cameron’s modernising agenda. The previous prime minister was critical of grammar schools, for example, and left Downing Street urging his successor to maintain promises on international aid.\n\nWhile there has been no suggestion of a shift in policy on the latter, some have questioned the decision to appoint Priti Patel, who has been critical of the Department for International Development’s work in the past, to lead the department. Cameron’s life chances strategy, which he had planned to unveil in the summer, has yet to be revealed by May’s government, although she has spoken about similar causes. However, Cameron’s ally insisted his decision was not linked to any of the changes.\n\nCameron’s decision is a turnaround, as he had previously said he wanted to continue as MP for Witney.\n\nGeorge Osborne, who served in Cameron’s cabinet as chancellor, tweeted:\n\nArriving at a private dinner for union leaders, Corbyn said he wanted to wish Cameron the best of luck.\n\n“I’m not going to say, ‘On your bike,’ I’ll say, ‘Good luck on your bike,’ and thank him for the courtesy he showed to me. And I’d also thank him for his dear mother’s advice on appearances. We had a very nice exchange of letters after he resigned as prime minister. It’s a change of life for him and the end of one political period ... I think we should respect people when they move on in their lives.”"
