        "text": "George Osborne\n\nFirst secretary of state and chancellor of the exchequer\n\nCameron’s right-hand man is effectively taking the position of deputy prime minister vacated by Nick Clegg with the new office of first secretary.\n\nBest quote: “Tax cuts should be for life, not just for Christmas.”\n\nTheresa May\n\nHome secretary\n\nTipped as a possible future leader, May is now the longest serving home secretary in 50 years.\n\nBest quote: “Like Indiana Jones, I don’t like snakes — though that might lead some to ask why I’m in politics.”\n\nPhilip Hammond\n\nForeign secretary\n\nPromoted from defence to the Foreign Office in the last Cameron reshuffle before the election, Hammond continues in the role he inherited from William Hague.\n\nBest quote: “The kind of Conservatism I was brought up on says that the first priority of the government is defending the country and maintaining law and order. Those are the two top priorities for me.”\n\nMichael Fallon\n\nDefence secretary\n\nAfter an aggressive election campaign where he accused Ed Miliband of stabbing his brother in the back, Fallon is back at the Ministry of Defence.\n\nBest quote: “This map of Sierra Leone was in a cupboard. I suppose at the end of Blair’s war they tossed it, thinking ‘we won’t need that again’. But then you do. All this, it comes around.”\n\nMichael Gove\n\nLord chancellor and justice secretary\n\nThe former education secretary and Times journalist, widely seen as having been demoted to chief whip in the last reshuffle, is back in a top job at the justice ministry, to oversee the possible repeal of the Human Rights Act.\n\nBest quote: “Were I ever alone in the dock I would not want to be arraigned before our flawed tribunals, knowing my freedom could be forfeit as a result of political pressures. I would prefer a fair trial, under the shadow of the noose.” From a Times article calling for the return of capital punishment.\n\nAnalysis: The legal profession may be wary of Gove, given he is not a lawyer and has made contentious statements on justice policy, including calling for the return of hanging and accusing the Stephen Lawrence inquiry of bearing the ‘whiff of Salem’. Also, given the overlap in their briefs, there is potential for further tensions between Gove and May, who came to blows over radicalisation in schools. However, his hawkish, neo-con approach to security is an area where Gove is appreciated by the Tory right. This may be his biggest asset to No 10 as Cameron seeks to navigate with a wafer-thin majority and keep his rightwing backbenchers on side. Rowena Mason\n\nChris Grayling\n\nLord president of the council and leader of the House of Commons\n\nThe former justice secretary lost his job, where he had made many enemies among the legal profession, and will take over retired Hague’s old post.\n\nBest quote: “People in this country are fed up with human rights being used as an excuse for unacceptable behaviour.”\n\nNicky Morgan\n\nSecretary of state for education and minister for women and equalities\n\nMorgan dramatically increased her majority at the election and she will keep both of her ministerial briefs, where she won plaudits especially for her rethink on equal marriage, which she had previously opposed.\n\nBest quote: “If you wanted to do something, or even if you didn’t know what you wanted to do, then the arts and humanities were what you chose because they were useful for all kinds of jobs. Of course, we know now that couldn’t be further from the truth.”\n\nMark Harper\n\nChief whip\n\nThe former immigration minister responsible for the controversial “Go Home” vans and who quit under a cloud after his cleaner was discovered to be an illegal immigrant is given the tough job of controlling rebellious backbenchers.\n\nBest quote: “People who claim disabled benefits but who are not disabled are not disabled people - it’s people who are pretending to be disabled to steal money off the taxpayer and campaigners should be pleased that we are exposing people.”\n\nLady Tina Stowell\n\nLeader of the House of Lords and lord privy seal\n\nThe Baroness of Beeston is the daughter of a factory worker, the antithesis to the “posh Tory” image.\n\nBest quote: “We need to brag a bit about what we achieve, and say that politics is not just about argy-bargy. Until we convince women that there is a point to being in politics, we won’t get as much interest in it as we need there to be.”\n\nAnalysis: Stowell was first appointed to these roles in July 2014, but was not made an official paid member of the cabinet, despite being able to attend meetings. Born and raised in Beeston, just outside Nottingham, where she attended a comprehensive, Stowell moved to London aged 18 to join the civil service as a secretary and worked her way up to become deputy chief of staff at Tory HQ during William Hague’s leadership. In 2013, as the government spokeswoman in the Lords for women and equalities, she was credited with successfully steering the same-sex marriage bill through the Lords. RM\n\nAmber Rudd\n\nEnergy and climate change secretary\n\nA fast promotion for Rudd, a former investment banker, who had been an under-secretary in the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and replaces Lib Dem Ed Davey.\n\nBest quote: “The first world leader to speak about climate change at the UN was Margaret Thatcher and she of course was a scientist and the science is completely compelling. If I’m challenged on it by any of my own party – although I haven’t been – I would say: ‘I’m a Thatcherite – aren’t you?’”\n\nAnalysis: A parliamentary aide to Osborne (a sure route to promotion) under the coalition, Rudd is considered to be on the moderate wing of the party and is known as a campaigner on women’s issues, including work as vice-chair of the parliamentary group against FGM and chair of the group for sex equality. As a firm believer in tackling climate change, her appointment is no victory for the Tory right, who will be expecting Cameron to implement his pledge to stop the march of onshore windfarms. Before entering politics, she worked in the City and financial journalism and ran her own executive search agency. Her brother is the famous PR executive Roland Rudd, who was close to New Labour. RM\n\nSajid Javid\n\nBusiness secretary\n\nThe former culture secretary, Javid takes over the portfolio from Lib Dem grandee Vince Cable, who lost his seat in the election.\n\nBest quote: “What we do in this country is great because, far from being ruled by central diktats, our culture is based on freedom and self-determination. That’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The Next Generation, season three, episode 26.”\n\nAnalysis: Javid was the first member of the 2010 election intake to become a cabinet minister when he was appointed culture secretary last April. But it was hardly an ideal appointment for someone whose cultural interests were thought to extend little beyond Star Trek. At business, he will be in his element: he studied economics and politics at university, worked in banking and his father ran a shop. As a former personal private secretary to Osborne, Javid is regarded as his protege, and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills officials will be glad to have a boss with clout at the Treasury. Javid’s Pakistani father arrived in the UK virtually penniless and it is thought his son’s rise from such a humble background could make him a compelling candidate to lead a party still handicapped by its elitist image. Andrew Sparrow\n\nPriti Patel\n\nMinister for employment and will attend cabinet\n\nA regular face on TV screens during the election campaign and a former executive of the backbench 1922 committee, Patel gets the job from Esther McVey, who lost her seat.\n\nBest quote: “Coming from a country where you’re persecuted means that you want to work hard and to contribute to the society where you end up. You become patriotic because you make your new country your home.”\n\nAnalysis: For a party that has been historically short of female and minority ethnic figures at the top, Patel’s promotion ticks two boxes at once, but her rise has not been accompanied by whispers about tokenism. With a long background in politics - working for the party as a press officer in the Hague era, when joining the Tories was not an option for careerists - Patel has robust, rightwing views. Before joining the Conservatives, she worked for the Referendum party, Sir James Goldsmith’s Eurosceptic party, leading up to the 1997 election. She is one of the few MPs who has openly advocated the return of hanging. AS\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nContinues as mayor of London and will attend cabinet\n\nNo ministerial post for the new MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip as he focuses on seeing out his term as mayor of London until 2016 – but he will be part of Cameron’s political team.\n\nBest quote: “My chances of being PM are about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or my being reincarnated as an olive.”\n\nAnalysis: Johnson had dropped some hints during the campaign about the possibility of doing a minor departmental job alongside his mayoralty. However, in giving his fellow Etonian the right to attend cabinet but no responsibility for a brief, Cameron has brought Johnson inside the tent and bound by collective responsibility, but not yet in charge of anything significant. This could all change, of course, after Johnson’s tenure as mayor ends next year and he is likely expect to be rewarded for his relative loyalty during the election campaign. RM\n\nRobert Halfon\n\nDeputy chairman of the Conservative party\n\nHalfon has enjoyed a rapid rise through the ranks and has been lauded for his efforts as a consumer rights champion and work for his constituency.\n\nBest quote: “In many ways Ukip have done us an enormous favour because they’re cleansing people from the Tory party that had these kinds of views, which is great because I don’t want people who have those kinds of views in my party. So good luck to them, really.”\n\nAnalysis: Cameron has reportedly called Halfon his most expensive backbencher because of his strong campaigning for a cut in fuel duty. The MP for Harlow in Essex and personal private secretary to Osborne is a proponent of what he describes as blue-collar Conservatism. In part, that is just small-state Thatcherism, but Halfon is also pro-union, in favour of increasing the minimum wage and anxious to ensure that people recognise a moral element within Conservatism. Halfon was born with spastic diplegia and walks with the aid of crutches and this may help to explain his sympathy for the disadvantaged, although his disability is not something he highlights. The Conservative deputy chairman normally takes a lead role in campaigning and Halfon has said he thinks cabinet ministers should take part in more Cameron Direct-style events. AS\n\nJohn Whittingdale\n\nCulture secretary\n\nThe former chair of the DCMS select committee, Whittingdale takes the brief from Javid, and will oversee negotiations for the BBC’s charter renewal.\n\nBest quote: “I think in the long term [the licence fee] is unsustainable. You have the question of whether or not it should remain a flat poll tax, collected through some fairly draconian measures.”\n\nAnalysis: Whittingdale has spent almost his whole life in politics - in Tory HQ, as a special adviser and as Thatcher’s political secretary – but this is his first ministerial role. During his time on the CMS committee, he gained a reputation for leading tough questioning of News International and the Murdochs over phone hacking. He is a longtime critic of the BBC licence fee and believes the BBC Trust is too close to the BBC. Whittingdale accused the head of the Leveson inquiry of straying beyond his remit and was a vocal opponent of any statutory regulation of the press. Regarded as a Thatcherite and Eurosceptic, he has been vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers and voted against same-sex marriage. RM\n\nAnna Soubry\n\nMinister for small business\n\nPreviously a defence minister with a responsibility for welfare and veterans, Soubry has been tipped as a potential future defence secretary. She will attend cabinet in her new post at the Department for Business and Skills under Sajid Javid.\n\nBest quote: “I came into politics to fight lefties … that’s where political fighting goes. The Tory party must learn from its own history that when we fight each other, you can guarantee to lose.”\n\nAnalysis: Soubry was probably never expecting to have a ministerial career in this parliament. Elected MP for Broxtowe in 2010 with a majority of 389, she was eighth on Labour’s list of target seats and constituency polls suggested she was going to lose. In fact, she was re-elected with a majority of more than 4,000.\n\nA former regional television presenter and a barrister, Soubry originally got involved in Conservative politics in the 1970s (she was the only Tory on the executive of the National Union of Students), spent some time in the SDP in the 1980s and was fast-tracked for selection as a Tory candidate after being put on the “A list” under David Cameron.\n\nShe was tipped for promotion from the moment she arrived in the Commons and joined the government as a health minister in 2012. What distinguishes her most from other ambitious colleagues is her outspokenness, which is considered to be brave or reckless according to taste. She once took on Nigel Farage on Question Time with a ferocity that impressed colleagues, but later prompted slightly different reactions when she said that Farage looked like “somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it”. She also complained in an interview that she was made public health minister because David Cameron had stereotypically decided that that portfolio was a “soft, girly option” appropriate for a woman. Cameron responded by making her a defence minister. where she prospered, perhaps because the MoD is a place where bluntness goes down well. Andrew Sparrow\n\nIain Duncan Smith\n\nWork and pensions secretary\n\nJournalists were told on Sunday night that IDS would be back at his department to continue his controversial welfare reform programme, publicly confirmed by Downing Street on Monday afternoon.\n\nBest quote: “Never underestimate the determination of a quiet man.”\n\nPatrick McLoughlin\n\nTransport secretary\n\nOne of HS2’s most fervent champions, former miner McLoughlin is back in the post he took over from Justine Greening in 2012\n\nBest quote: “I just think we’ve got to show people we’re on their side, to be honest. And we want to reward those who put the effort in.”\n\nLiz Truss\n\nSecretary of state for environment, food & rural affairs\n\nRumoured to have been considered for a move to Jeremy Hunt’s post as health secretary, but she will stay in her pre-election post.\n\nBest quote: “I have seen too many chaotic settings in nurseries, where children are running around. There’s no sense of purpose.\n\nAnalysis: Truss, who was promoted to environment secretary after Owen Paterson’s sacking in July 2014, is to continue in the post. Truss has been an enthusiastic backer of British farmers and food but has been much less vocal on the natural environment. Truss has said the highly controversial badger cull will be rolled out more widely. Most farmers support the cull, aimed at curbing tuberculosis in cattle, but scientists have declared it ineffective. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was heavily cut in by the coalition and, as an unprotected department, faces further cuts. With the large flood defence budget now set until 2020, other areas are likely to suffer. Damian Carrington\n\nJustine Greening\n\nInternational development secretary\n\nThe former transport secretary was elected with an increased majority and she will continue in the post she was controversially “shuffled” to in 2012 after expressing opposition to a third runway at Heathrow.\n\nBest quote: “”I like to cut through the crap and get things done.”\n\nTheresa Villiers\n\nNorthern Ireland secretary\n\nVilliers had told the Irish press over the weekend she was keen to continue in the role she has held since 2012, and she will stay there, though she had been rumoured to be on the way out.\n\nBest quote: “It seems to me that resilience and sticking power is a key quality in politics. You never know what’s coming round the corner.”\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nHealth secretary\n\nHunt has kept his job at the Department of Health, but one of the things he has said he wants to push for this parliament, outside of his brief, is a repeal of the fox hunting ban.\n\nBest quote: “In places that should be devoted to patients, where compassion should be uppermost, we find its very opposite: a coldness, resentment, indifference, even contempt.”\n\nOliver Letwin\n\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in overall charge of Cabinet Office\n\nAs he was spied going into No 10 on Monday lunchtime, Letwin replied “no” when asked if he wanted a new job. He has got one anyway, as a minister attending cabinet, with responsibility for the Cabinet office.\n\nBest quote: “If necessary, I would go out on the streets and beg rather than send [my children] to the school next to where I live.”\n\nAnalysis: Letwin enjoyed the title of minister for government policy in the last parliament. He will effectively carry on doing the same job, although David Cameron has promoted him, making him a full member of the cabinet.\n\nAll ministers have some sort of responsibility for government policy, but Letwin was the man who pulled it all together and (supposedly) ironed out any contradictions and inconsistencies. Cameron describes him as the government’s “mainframe computer”. Immensely clever, but also personable, self-effacing and even at times giggly, Letwin has been charged with resolving disputes between departments and, in the coalition, he was a key link man with the Liberal Democrats. He developed a particularly warm relationship with Danny Alexander; they used to speak on the phone every Sunday to resolve upcoming coalition difficulties.\n\nLetwin’s role was largely a backroom one and this is likely to continue. Although highly cerebral, Letwin is regarded as slightly unworldly and his dealings with the media have not always worked out well. He was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury before the 2001 election, but had to spend part of the campaign being kept away from journalists after being named as the source of a briefing saying Tory plans for cuts went far beyond what the party was publicly acknowledging. Andrew Sparrow\n\nGreg Hands\n\nChief secretary to the Treasury\n\nThe American-born former whip and former parliamentary private secretary to George Osborne will replace the now seat-less Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander.\n\nBest quote: “I am strongly opposed to all forms of proportional representation. I wouldn’t call that a reform. I would call that a retrograde step.”\n\nAnalysis: Many expected the position to go to Matthew Hancock, who has instead been made Cabinet Office minister.\n\nThe appointment is a significant promotion for Hands, the MP for Chelsea and Fulham, who went to grammar school before studying history at Cambridge University. He worked on trading floors for 10 years in the City of London and on Wall Street, first becoming a Conservative councillor in Fulham in 1998.\n\nHands served as shadow Treasury minister from January 2009 to May 2010 before being appointed to work for Osborne.\n\nHands took a gap year in West Berlin, during which time he developed a strong interest in eastern Europe. Already fluent in German and French, he also learned Czech and Slovak, spending spells in Prague during his university holidays. Frances Perraudin\n\nMatt Hancock\n\nMinister for Cabinet Office and paymaster general, minister for efficiency and civil service reform\n\nRumoured to be heading to the chief secretary role, Hancock will instead switch from working as a minister for further education to overseeing Whitehall reforms\n\nBest quote: “Entrepreneurship is not only about starting businesses but is an attitude to life.”\n\nAnalysis: A former chief of staff to George Osborne, Hancock is now a Cabinet Office minister in charge of efficiency and civil service reform. This was the job held by costcutter-in-chief Francis Maude, who retired as an MP at the election. It gives Hancock a significant influence on Whitehall belt-tightening – areas that the chancellor will want to have a close eye on as he seeks to eliminate the deficit.\n\nAged just 36, Hancock worked for a time at the Bank of England but has spent most of his career in politics at Osborne’s side and later as a minister. Under the coalition, his briefs were business and energy, where he attracted criticism for taking a private plane back from climate talks in Scotland and accepting donations from a key backer of climate change sceptics. Rowena Mason\n\nStephen Crabb\n\nSecretary of state for Wales\n\nThe MP for Pembrokeshire and rugby enthusiast continues in the role he held before the election, where he had become the first cabinet minister to have a beard for more than 100 years.\n\nBest quote: “My mother made a journey from total welfare dependency to working full-time and being in a position where she could buy her own car. That was a huge, momentous moment for us as a family when I was a teenager. I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work.”\n\nDavid Mundell\n\nSecretary of state for Scotland\n\nHe is the only Tory MP north of the border and reportedly cancelled a planned holiday to Florida after realising he had kept his seat of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale despite an SNP onslaught.\n\nBest quote: “Clearly I built my house on high foundations in terms of my own constituency so I was able to withstand the [nationalist] flood when it came.”\n\nAnalysis: Mundell is the only Tory MP with a seat in Scotland so really the only possible choice for what will be a difficult job in charge of negotiating devolution with the SNP and trying to hold together the union.\n\nMundell has been in the Scotland Office for a while as a minister so this means a promotion to replace his old Liberal Democrat boss, Alistair Carmichael. First on the agenda will be sorting out which tax powers will be handed to Holyrood. It is difficult for the Conservatives to claim much of a mandate in Scotland given that 56 out of 59 MPs in the country now belong to the SNP, but, for what it’s worth, the Lib Dems and Labour also only have one each.\n\nBefore entering politics as an MSP and MP, Mundell was a solicitor who worked for BT. Not a great deal has been written about his politics but he was for a period a member of the SDP during the Thatcher era and an interview with the Herald says he is nicknamed Fluffy for his warm approachability. Rowena Mason\n\nGreg Clark\n\nCommunities and local government secretary\n\nClark is likely to be pleased with his new job, in which he replaces Eric Pickles, as he has long spoken passionately about this policy area.\n\nBest quote: “When our cities do well, our country does well.”\n\nAnalysis: Clark was in the shadow cabinet before the arrival of the coalition which meant he got a series of more junior ministerial jobs for decentralisation, constitution and universities, as well as financial secretary to the Treasury. Throughout most of that time, he clung on to the cities portfolio. Yet another appointment from the liberal centrist wing of the party, he is well liked and regarded as a competent brain. Clark also appears to be a genuine enthusiast about devolution. Rowena Mason\n\nRos Altmann\n\nPensions minister\n\nPensions expert and former head of Saga, will join the government as pensions minister. She is not an MP, so she will become a peer."
