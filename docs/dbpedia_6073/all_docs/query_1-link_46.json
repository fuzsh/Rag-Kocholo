        "text": "Despite not being an elected lawmaker, David Cameron was named Foreign Secretary in Rishi Sunak's government after a cabinet reshuffle on Monday (November 13).\n\nJames Cleverly has taken Suella Braverman's place in the government, following her dismissal. Following her illegal piece denouncing the way pro-Palestinian marches had been policed and remarks about limiting the usage of tents for the homeless, Mr Braverman's top position in government had come under pressure.\n\nAs Mr Cameron settles into his new role, here's what we know so far about the recent reshuffle.\n\nIs David Cameron an MP?\n\nMr Cameron isn't an MP. From 2010 to 2016, Mr Cameron led Britain's first coalition administration in almost 70 years. He also formed the country's first majority Conservative government in nearly 20 years during the 2015 General Election.\n\nAfter winning the Witney seat in 2001, he served as the Conservative Party leader for four years, during which time he worked to restructure the organisation on a new, clear platform.\n\nOn May 11, 2010, after the general election of 2010, Mr Cameron was appointed prime minister, and the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition administration.\n\nWho can become a Cabinet Minister?\n\nAccording to iNews, the unwritten constitution of the UK does not require an MP to hold the position of minister.\n\nTo take up such a position, you must, according to the ministerial code, be a member of the House of Commons or the House of Lords.\n\nAccording to Sky News, these ministers were appointed to the House of Lords in recent years so that they would be answerable to the parliament.\n\nThus, in order to comply with the convention, Mr Cameron might be appointed a peer.\n\nThe announcement of a possible new member and their appointment to the House of Lords can occur over a few weeks apart.\n\nHow did David Cameron become Foreign Secretary?\n\nIn order to uphold the tradition that members of the Government must be serving in Parliament, he had to be appointed as a member of the House of Lords at the same time.\n\nWhat is the House of Lords?\n\nThe second house of the UK parliament is called the House of Lords. It is essential for reviewing legislation, challenging the actions of the government, and looking into public policy."
