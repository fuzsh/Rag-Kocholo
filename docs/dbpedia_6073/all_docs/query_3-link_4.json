        "text": "The Liberal-Conservative coalition government have made good on their promise to release the full list of special advisers - including details of what they earn.\n\nAs several reports have pointed out, the figures show that David Cameron's spin doctor in chief Andy Coulson gets paid more than deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.\n\nPolly Curtis writes:\n\nCoulson is Cameron's most senior adviser and is paid just £2,500 less than his boss. Clegg receives a cabinet minister wage of £134,565 a year. The ceiling for special advisers' pay is £142,500, ensuring they do not earn more than Cameron. They are paid for by taxpayers to provide political advice to ministers and No 10.\n\nThe list shows that Coulson is one of three of Cameron's senior aides earning six-figure salaries – the others are Edward Llewellyn and Kate Fall.\n\nLlewellyn, Cameron's chief of staff, gets £125,000 and Fall, Llewellyn's deputy, gets £100,000. Gabby Bertin, Cameron's press secretary, earns £80,000, and Steve Hilton, Cameron's most influential policy adviser, is paid £90,000.\n\nThe number of special adviser posts has also been cut from 78 – the number under Gordon Brown – to 68, which includes seven vacancies. It is thought this could reduce the pay bill by as much as £2m. Last year's bill was £6.8m.\n\nThe release comes with another detailing the workings of government: the full list of cabinet office staff, including their email addresses.\n\nYou can download the adviser data below - what can you do with it?\n\nDownload the data\n\nDATA: download the full list as a spreadsheet\n\nCan you do something with this data?\n\nFlickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group or mail us at datastore@guardian.co.uk\n\nWorld government data\n\nSearch the world's government datasets"
