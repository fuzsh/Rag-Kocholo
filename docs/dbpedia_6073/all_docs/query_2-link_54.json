        "text": "David Cameron has hummed a little tune, held his last Cabinet meeting, and stepped down as Prime Minister.\n\nAfter Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the Conservative leadership race on Monday, leaving Theresa May unopposed, he accelerated his exit.\n\n“Obviously with these changes we now don’t need a prolonged period of transition,” he said, offering his support for the incoming May.\n\nCameron spent six years as Prime Minister, but it is the events of last month – the decision to hold an EU Referendum – that will define his legacy.\n\nAs the whirlwind of change that surrounds British politics continues, we look at the successes and the failures of his premiership.\n\nFailures\n\nThe EU Referendum\n\nWhether you’re Leave or Remain, there is no denying that the decision to Brexit is an unmitigated disaster for David Cameron, who promptly fell on his sword as the result was revealed on June 24. His swift resignation, admirable as it was, will not obscure the fact that Cameron included the promise of an EU Referendum in his Conservative manifesto as means of garnering votes. The foreign press, in particular, savaged him: a “gamble” and “epic miscalculation” said the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBalancing the books\n\nDavid Cameron was elected – twice – on promises to reduce the deficit. The Conservatives, he argued in 2010 and 2015, could be trusted with the economy – and Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband couldn’t. His Chancellor George Osborne, as a result of the decision to Brexit, has now abandoned plans to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020. However, figures in November 2015 and again in June this year revealed that the Chancellor was some way off hitting his targets – despite it being a centrepiece of his and Cameron’s policy and the justification for austerity.\n\nGoing ‘green’\n\nAs Cameron ascended to Prime Minister in 2010, after the Conservative and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition, he promised to lead the “greenest Government ever” – something he was repeating as recently as last year. However, as part of George Osborne’s austerity drive, the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s £3.3bn budget has been scaled back, with the government’s home energy efficiency programme a high-profile casualty. Cameron’s former chief climate change adviser, Lord Deben, said in November the government is “clearly failing” on its green energy commitments.\n\nCreating ‘Big Society’\n\nDavid Cameron’s promise to create a ‘Big Society’, announced as his “great passion” just two months in his premiership in 2010, seems a long time ago after six years of austerity. It has been widely dismissed as a failure. Danny Kruger, a former adviser and speechwriter, argued in 2014, that Cameron’s government “has devalued the big society idea” by “bashing burglars and immigrants”. Last year, The Civil Exchange, a think-tank, dismissed the Big Society as having “largely failed.” “There is now a more divided society in which power has not been shared significantly with those who have least,” it said.\n\nRestructuring the NHS\n\nThe government’s relationship with doctors, nurses and the British Medical Association has, for the most part, been strained. The BMA’s chief, Dr Mark Porter, has criticised Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s “corrosive dispute” with junior doctors. His predecessor, Andrew Lansley, was even more unpopular. In 2014, government sources admitted his restructuring had been a “huge strategic error” – as one insider told The Times these plans were “unintelligible gobbledegook”. In 2015, NHS hospital waiting times were at their highest in seven years.\n\nSuccesses\n\nGay marriage\n\nThe historic introduction of same-sex marriage, passed by Parliament in July 2013, is something Cameron has said he will always “treasure”. In an article for Pink News at the time, he wrote: “This is an important moment for our country. It says we are a country that will continue to honour its proud traditions of respect, tolerance and equal worth.” And, at a Q&A in 2014, he added: “Lots of people have invited me [to same-sex weddings] and sent me lovely letters saying if it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be able to marry the person I love.”\n\nIncreasing the foreign aid budget\n\nDavid Cameron once named the increase in Britain’s foreign aid budget – to £11.4billion – as his “proudest achievement” in government. Figures from the Office for National Statistics in 2014 put the number at 0.7 per cent of the country’s GDP. “I think there are lots of countries, and lots of politicians as well, I could probably name them, who would have broken that promise,” he said at the time. “I don’t think you break your promise to the poorest people in the poorest countries in the world,” he said.\n\nTackling modern slavery\n\nThe Modern Slavery Act was championed by Cameron’s successor, Theresa May, but it is still a fine achievement of his government. Given the Global Slavery Index estimates that 36 million people are living in modern slavery today, legislation was long overdue. Although human rights charities have said it doesn’t go far enough to protect victims, it’s undoubtedly a step in the right direction.\n\nCreating millions of new jobs\n\nAhead of the 2015 election, David Cameron claimed his government had created almost two million new jobs since 2010 – the equivalent, as he put it, of 1,000 a day. While some of these jobs are highly controversial zero-hour contracts, the number of jobs in the UK did rise by 1.8m in this five-year period, the same rate of increase as in US and higher than in Germany. Considering the recession had threatened huge employment, this can be considered one of Cameron’s achievements.\n\nAchieving a parliamentary majority in 2015\n\nThe day before the 2015 General Election, Ed Miliband’s Labour party were given a four-point lead over Cameron’s Tories in some final-minute polls – suggesting, at very worst for Labour, a hung parliament, and likely a Left-leaning coalition, with the chance of a reduced Conservative party hanging on to power unlikely. Instead, the exit polls suggested what no one had predicted: a majority – and stunning victory – for Cameron. Miliband lost, the Lib Dems were virtually wiped out, and the Cameron settled in for four more years…"
