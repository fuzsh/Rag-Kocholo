        "text": "News & Events | About PKU News | Contact | Site Search\n\nPeking University, Nov. 10, 2010: Visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron called for a \"stronger relationship\" with China, saying the rise of the nation is an opportunity to other countries.\n\n\"We want a stronger relationship with China. Stronger on trade, investment and dialogue,\" said Cameron while delivering a speech at Peking University on the afternoon of Nov. 10.\n\nVisiting British Prime Minister David Cameron delivers a speech and answers questions from students at Peking University in Beijing, Nov. 10, 2010. (Xinhua/Xie Huanchi)\n\nThe British Prime Minister mentioned aspects beyond bilateral economic and trade ties. âThere is no secret we disagree on some issues, especially around human rights. We donât raise these issues to make us look good, or to flaunt publicly that weâve done so. We raise them because the British people expect us to â and because we have sincere and deeply-held concerns.â\n\n... \"All the time the [British] government is subject to the rule of law. These are constraints on the government and at times they can be frustratingâ¦ but ultimately we believe they make our government better and our country stronger.â\n\nProf. Lin Jianhua, Executive Vice President of PKU, presided over the event, which was held at the Administrative Building.\n\nBelow is a transcript of Cameron's speech at Peking University on Nov. 10, 2010 (Source: Office of UK Prime Minister).\n\nIntroduction\n\nTwenty five years ago I came to Hong Kong as a student.\n\nThe year was 1985.\n\nDeng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher had recently signed the historic Joint Declaration.\n\nThe remarkable story of the successful handover of Hong Kongâ¦\n\nâ¦and the great progress Hong Kong has continued to makeâ¦\n\nâ¦is an example to the world of what can be achieved when two countries cooperate in confidence and with mutual respect.\n\nSince then, China has changed almost beyond recognition.\n\nChinaâs National Anthem famously calls on the people of China to stand upâ¦\n\nQi-lai qi-lai (stand up, stand up)\n\nToday the Chinese people are not just standing up in their own countryâ¦\n\nâ¦they are standing up in the world.\n\nNo longer can people talk about the global economyâ¦\n\nâ¦without including the country that has grown on average ten per cent a year for three decades.\n\nNo longer can we talk about tradeâ¦\n\nâ¦without the country that is now the worldâs largest exporter and third largest importerâ¦\n\nAnd no longer can we debate energy security or climate changeâ¦\n\nâ¦without the country that is one of the worldâs biggest consumer of energy.\n\nChina is on course to reclaim, later this century, its position as the worldâs biggest economyâ¦\n\nâ¦the position it has held for 18 of the last 20 centuries.\n\nâ¦and an achievement of which the Chinese people are justly proud.\n\nPut simply: China has re-emerged as a great global power.\n\nThreat or Opportunity\n\nNow people can react to this in one of two ways.\n\nThey can see Chinaâs rise as a threatâ¦\n\nâ¦or they can see it as an opportunity.\n\nThey can protect their markets from Chinaâ¦\n\nâ¦or open their markets to China.\n\nThey can try and shut China outâ¦\n\nâ¦or welcome China in, to a new place at the top table of global affairs.\n\nThere has been a change of Government in Britain and a change of Prime Minister.\n\nBut on this vital point there is absolute continuity between my government and the Governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\n\nWe want a strong relationship with China. Strong on trade. Strong on investment. Strong on dialogue.\n\nI made that clear as Leader of the Opposition when I visited Beijing and Chongqing three years ago.\n\nAnd I repeat it as Prime Minister here in Chinaâs capital today.\n\nIn the argument about how to react to the rise of Chinaâ¦\n\nâ¦I say itâs an opportunity.\n\nI choose engagement not disengagement.\n\nDialogue not stand-off.\n\nMutual benefit, not zero-sum game.\n\nPartnership not protectionism.\n\nBritain is the country that argues most passionately for globalisation and free trade.\n\nFree trade is in our DNA.\n\nAnd we want trade with China. As much of it as we can get.\n\nThatâs why I have with me on this visit one of the biggest and most high-powered delegations a British Prime Minister has ever led to China.\n\nJust think about some of the prizes that the rise of China could help to bring within our grasp.\n\nStrong, and sustainable growth for the global economy.\n\nVital progress on the Doha trade round which could add $170 billion to the global economy.\n\nA real chance to get back on track towards a legally binding deal on emissions\n\nUnprecedented progress in tackling poverty.\n\nChina has lifted 500 million people out of poverty in just thirty years.\n\nAlthough there is still a long way to go â thatâs more people lifted out of poverty than at any time in human history.\n\nYou can see the results right across this enormous country.\n\nWhen I worked in Hong Kong briefly in 1985, Shenzhen was barely more than a small town, surrounded by paddy fields and waterways.\n\nToday it is a city larger than London. It makes most of the worldâs iPods and one in ten of its mobile phones.\n\nAnd there are other benefits too in tackling the worldâs most intractable problems.\n\nI welcome the fact, for example, that more than 900 Chinese doctors now work in African countries and that in Uganda it is a Chinese pharmaceutical firm that is introducing a new anti-malarial drug.\n\nSo I want to make the positive caseâ¦\n\nâ¦for the world to see Chinaâs rise as an opportunity not a threat.\n\nBut China needs to help us to make that argumentâ¦\n\nâ¦to demonstrate that as your economy grows, so do our shared interests, and our shared responsibilities.\n\nWe share an interest in Chinaâs integration into the world economy, which is essential for Chinaâs development.\n\nIf we are to maintain Europeâs openness to China, we must be able to show that China is open to Europe.\n\nSo we share an interest in an international system governed by rules and norms.\n\nWe share an interest in effective cooperative governance, including for the world economy.\n\nWe share an interest in fighting protectionismâ¦\n\nâ¦and in a co-ordinated rebalancing between surplus and deficit countries.\n\nThese interests, those responsibilities are both economic and political.\n\nLet me take each in turn.\n\nEconomic Responsibilities\n\nFirst, economic responsibilities.\n\nLetâs get straight to the point.\n\nThe world economy has begun to grow again after the crisis.\n\nBut that growth is very uneven.\n\nLed by China, Asia and other emerging markets are growing quickly.\n\nBut in much of the advanced world growth is slow and fragile and unemployment stubbornly high.\n\nWe should not be surprised at this.\n\nThe crisis has damaged many advanced economies and weakened their financial sectors.\n\nThey face major structural and fiscal adjustments to rebalance their economies.\n\nThis is true of my own country.\n\nWe know what steps we need to take to restore the public finances and rebalance our economy towards greater saving and investment and greater exports.\n\nAnd we have begun to take them.\n\nBut for the world economy to be able to grow strongly again â and to grow without creating the dangerous economic and financial instabilities that led to the crisis, we need more than just adjustment in the advanced world.\n\nThe truth is that some countries with current account surpluses have been saving too muchâ¦\n\nâ¦while others like mine with deficits have been saving too little.\n\nAnd the result has been a dangerous tidal wave of money going from one side of the globe to the other.\n\nWe need a more balanced pattern of global demand and supply, a more balanced pattern of global saving and investment.\n\nNow sometimes when you hear people talk about economic imbalances, it can seem as though countries that are successful at exporting are being blamed for their success.\n\nThatâs absolutely not the case.\n\nWe all share an interest and a responsibility to co-operate to secure strong and balanced global growth.\n\nThere is no greater illustration of this than what happened to China as the western banking system collapsedâ¦\n\nâ¦Chinese exports fell 12 per centâ¦\n\nâ¦growth dropped to its lowest point in more than a decadeâ¦\n\nâ¦and some 20 million jobs were lost in the Chinese export sector.\n\nChanges in the structure of our economies will take time.\n\nWhat is important is that the major economies of the world have a shared vision of the path of this change: what actions countries should avoid; what actions countries need to take and, crucially, over what period it should happen.\n\nThis is why the G20 â and the meeting in Seoul â is so important.\n\nTogether we can agree a common approach.\n\nWe can commit to the necessary actions.\n\nWe can agree that we will hold each other to account.\n\nAnd just as China played a leading role at the G20 in helping to avert a global depressionâ¦\n\nâ¦so it can lead now.\n\nI know from my discussions with Premier Wen how committed China is to actions to rebalance its economy.\n\nChina is already talking about moving towards increased domestic consumptionâ¦\n\nâ¦better healthcare and welfareâ¦\n\nâ¦ more consumer goods as its middle class growsâ¦\n\nâ¦and in time introducing greater market flexibility into its exchange rate.\n\nThis can not be completed overnightâ¦\n\nâ¦but it must happen.\n\nLetâs be clear about the risks if it does notâ¦\n\nâ¦about what is at stake for China and for the UK â countries that depend on an open global economy.\n\nAt the worst point of the crisis, we averted protectionism.\n\nBut at a time of slow growth and high unemployment in many countries those pressures will rise againâ¦\n\nâ¦.already you can see them.\n\nCountries will increasingly be tempted to try to maximise their own growth and their own employment, at the expense of others.\n\nGlobalisation â the force that has been so powerful in driving development and bringing huge numbers into the world economy could go into reverse.\n\nIf we follow that path we will all lose out.\n\nThe West would lose for sure. But so too would China.\n\nFor the last two decades, trade has been a very positive factor in Chinaâs re-emergence on the world stage.\n\nIt has driven amazing growthâ¦\n\nâ¦and raised the living standards of millions.\n\nTrade has helped stitch back Chinaâs network of relations with countries across the world.\n\nWe need to make sure that it does not turn into a negative factor.\n\nJust as the West wants greater access to Chinese marketsâ¦\n\nâ¦so China wants greater access to Western marketsâ¦\n\nâ¦and it wants market economy status in the EU too.\n\nI had very constructive talks with Premier Wen on exactly this issue yesterday.\n\nI will make the case for China to get market economy status in the EUâ¦\n\nâ¦but China needs to help, by showing that it is committed to becoming more open, as it becomes more prosperous.\n\nAnd we need to work together to do more to protect intellectual property rightsâ¦\n\nâ¦because this will give more businesses confidence to come and invest in China.\n\nUK companies are uniquely placed to support Chinaâs demand for more high value goods for its consumers.\n\nOur Pavilion at the World Expo in Shanghai â which won the Gold Award for the best Pavilion design â was a showcase for so many of Britainâs strengthsâ¦\n\nâ¦from advanced engineering to educationâ¦\n\nâ¦from great brands to great pharmaceutical businessesâ¦\n\nâ¦from low carbon to financial services to the creative industries.\n\nIn all these areas and many more, British companies and British exports can help China deliver the prosperity and progress it seeks.\n\nWe can be part of Chinaâs development strategy, just as China is part of ours.\n\nA true partnership of growth.\n\nIn recent days, Britain has won new business worth billions of poundsâ¦\n\nâ¦involving companies across the UK and cities all over China.\n\nâ¦including a deal between Rolls Royce and China Eastern Airlines for 16 Airbus 330 aeroengines worth ï¿¡750 millionâ¦\n\nâ¦and inward investments worth in excess of ï¿¡300 million\n\nThis is all in addition to at least ï¿¡3bn of business which British companies have secured as part of the Airbus contract concluded with China last weekâ¦\n\nâ¦and a further ï¿¡2 billion of investments by Tesco to develop new shopping malls over the next five years.\n\nAnd with nearly 50 of Britainâs most influential culture, education and business leaders joining me on this visitâ¦\n\nâ¦I hope these deals can be just the beginning of a whole new era of bilateral trade between our countries.\n\nAchieving this would be a real win-win for our two countries.\n\nSo if China is prepared to pursue further opening of its marketsâ¦\n\nâ¦and to work with Britain and the other G20 countries to rebalance the world economy and take steps over time towards internationalising its currencyâ¦\n\nâ¦that will go a long way towards helping the global economy lock in the stability it needs for strong and sustainable growth.\n\nAnd just as importantly, it will go a long way in securing confidence in the global community that China as an economic power is a force for good.\n\nPolitical Responsibilities\n\nBut China does not just have new economic power.\n\nIt has new political power.\n\nAnd that brings new political responsibilities too.\n\nWhat China says â and what China does â really matters.\n\nThere is barely a global issue that needs resolution, which does not beg the questions: what does China think, and how can China contribute to a solution?\n\nChina has attempted to avoid entanglement in global affairs in the past. But Chinaâs size and global reach means that this is no longer a realistic choice.\n\nWhether itâs climate change or development, health and education or global security, China is too big and too important now not to play its part.\n\nOn climate change, an international deal has to be fair.\n\nAnd that means that countries with different histories canât all be expected to contribute in exactly the same way.\n\nBut a fair deal also means that all countries contributeâ¦\n\nâ¦and all are part of an agreement.\n\nAnd thereâs actually a huge opportunity here for China.\n\nBecause China can really profit from having some of the most efficient green energy in the world.\n\nOn international security, great powers have a bigger interest than anyone in preserving stability.\n\nTake development for example, China is one of the fastest growing investors in Africaâ¦\n\nâ¦with a vital influence over whether Africa can become a new source of growth for the world economy.\n\nWe want to work together to ensure that the money we spend in Africa is not supporting corrupt and intolerant regimes.\n\nAnd the meeting of the UN Security Council which the British Foreign Secretary will chair later this month provides a good opportunity to step up our co-operation on Sudan.\n\nAs Chinaâs star rises again in the world, so does its stake in a stable and ordered world, in which trade flows freely.\n\nToday, China is the worldâs second biggest importer of oil, and Sudan is one of your most important suppliers.\n\nSo China has a direct national interest in working for stability in Sudan.\n\nAnd four fifths of your oil imports pass through the Malacca Straits.\n\nSo like Britain and the other big trading nations, you depend on open sea lanes.\n\nAnd like us, your stability and prosperity depends in part on the stability and prosperity of others.\n\nWhether itâs nuclear proliferation, a global economic crisis or the rise of international terrorism, todayâs threats to our security do not respect geographical boundaries.\n\nThe proliferation of nuclear material endangers lives in Nanjing as well as New York.\n\nChina is playing an active role in helping to prevent conflagration over the DPRK.\n\nWe have been working with China in the UN Security Council to keep up the pressure on Iran â¦\n\nâ¦and Chinaâs continuing role here is vital if we are to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn your own region, I believe China can work with us to improve the situation for the Myanmarese people.\n\nAnd China is one of the few countries that Myanmar will listen to on this point.\n\nBut political responsibilities are not just about how one country interacts with anotherâ¦\n\nâ¦those responsibilities also apply to the way a country empowers its own people.\n\nPolitical Perspectives\n\nIt is undeniable that greater economic freedom has contributed to Chinaâs growing economic strength.\n\nAs Chinaâs economy generates higher living standards and more choice for Chinese people, there is inevitably debate within China about the relationship between greater economic freedom and greater political freedom.\n\nI recognise that we approach these issues with different perspectives. I understand too that being in government is a huge challenge.\n\nIâm finding that running a country of 60 million people.\n\nSo I can only begin to imagine what it is like leading a country of 1.3 billion.\n\nI realise this presents challenges of a different order of magnitude.\n\nWhen I came here last I was Britainâs Leader of the Opposition.\n\nNow weâve had a General Election.\n\nIt produced a Coalition Government, which combines two different political parties â the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats â with different histories and political philosophies, working together for the good of our country.\n\nThe Labour Party is now the official Opposition, with a constitutional duty to hold the new Government publicly to account.\n\nIndeed if I were not in Beijing this Wednesday afternoon, I would be preparing for my weekly session of Prime Ministerâs questions in the House of Commons, where MPs question me freely about the whole range of government policy.\n\nAll the time the government is subject to the rule of law.\n\nThese are constraints on the government, and at times they can be frustrating when the Courts take a view with which the government differsâ¦\n\nâ¦but ultimately we believe that they make our government better and our country stronger.\n\nThrough the media, the public get to hear directly from people who hold different views from the government.\n\nThat can be difficult at times, too.\n\nBut we believe that the better informed the British public is about the issues affecting our societyâ¦\n\nâ¦the easier it is, ultimately, for the British government to come to sensible decisions and to develop robust policies that command the confidence of our people.\n\nI make these observations not because I believe that we have some moral superiority.\n\nOur own society is not perfect.\n\nThere is still injustice which we must work hard to tackle.\n\nWe are far from immune from poverty and the ills that afflict every nation on earth.\n\nBut in arguing for a strong relationship between our countries, I want a relationship in which we can be open with each other, in which we can have constructive dialogue of give and take in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect.\n\nThe rise in economic freedom in China in recent years has been hugely beneficial to China and to the world.\n\nI hope that in time this will lead to a greater political openingâ¦\n\nâ¦because I am convinced that the best guarantor of prosperity and stability is for economic and political progress to go in step together.\n\nIn some respects it already has.\n\nOrdinary Chinese people today have more freedom over where they liveâ¦\n\nâ¦what job they doâ¦\n\nâ¦and where they travelâ¦\n\nâ¦than ever before.\n\nPeople blog and text more.\n\nItâs right to recognise this progress.\n\nBut itâs right also that Britain should be open with China on issues where, no doubt partly because of our different history and culture, we continue to take a different view.\n\nThere is no secret that we disagree on some issues, especially around human rights.\n\nWe donât raise these issues to make to us look good, or to flaunt publicly that we have done so.\n\nWe raise them because the British people expect us to, and because we have sincere and deeply held concerns.\n\nAnd I am pleased that we have agreed the next human rights dialogue between our two governments for January.\n\nBecause in the end, being able to talk through these issues â however difficult â makes our relationship stronger.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo let me finish where I began.\n\nChinaâs success â and continued success â is good for Britain and good for the world.\n\nItâs not in our national interests for China to stumbleâ¦\n\nâ¦or for the Chinese economy to suffer a reverse.\n\nWe have to make the caseâ¦\n\nâ¦.and I hope China will help us make the caseâ¦\n\nâ¦.that as China gets richer, it does not follow that the rest of the world will get poorer.\n\nIt is simply not true that as China rises again in the world, others must necessarily decline.\n\nGlobalisation is not a zero sum game.\n\nIf we manage things properly, if we win the arguments for free trade, if we find a way to better regulation, we can both grow together.\n\nBut if we donât, we will both suffer.\n\nI referred earlier to Britainâs Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo, âthe Dandelionâ\n\nWe are extremely proud that it won a coveted prize, and that it proved so popular with Chinese visitors.\n\nIt is, in its way, a symbol of the strength and the potential in our relationship.\n\nTwo different countries, past and future Olympic hosts, on far sides of the world, sowing the seeds of a flourishing relationship in the future, a relationship which has the potential to grow and to bloom.\n\nProof, perhaps, that Confucius was right when he saidâ¦\n\nâ¦âwithin the four seas all men are brothersâ\n\nYes, there we will be storms to weather.\n\nYes, there will be perils to overcome.\n\nYes, we will have to persevere.\n\nBut it will be worth it â for Britain, for China and for the world.\n\nExtended Reading:\n\nPKU News
