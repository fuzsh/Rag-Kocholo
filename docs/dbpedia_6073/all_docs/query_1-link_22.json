        "text": "Cameron joined parliament in 2001 and became leader of his party just four years later [Reuters]\n\nDavid Cameron, leader of the Conservative party, has ended 13 years of Labour rule, becoming Britain’s youngest prime minister for 200 years.\n\nThe 43-year-old has enjoyed a rapid and seemingly effortless rise to the top, from his election as an MP in 2001, to party leader in 2005, and finally prime minister in 2010.\n\nBut the appointment as prime minister did not come easily, with his Conservative party failing to win a clear parliamentary majority in the May 6 election.\n\nCameron was only able to form government after a deal was brokered between his party and the Liberal Democrats, seeing the country’s first ruling coalition since 1945.\n\nThe leader, credited with making the Conservatives – once labelled the “nasty party” – a viable alternative to Labour, must now convince voters that the party’s reinvention is more than skin deep.\n\nExclusive club\n\nCameron has attempted to model the party in his own image – as an eco-friendly, down-to-earth man of the people who rides his bike to work\n\nBut some critics accuse Cameron, who was educated at Eton, Britain’s most exclusive school, of being too privileged to understand the problems of ordinary citizens.\n\nspecial report\n\nOthers say he lacks substance, experience and a clear ideology.\n\nBorn in October 1966, Cameron studied at Oxford University, where he joined the elitist Bullingdon dining club and gained a first-class degree in politics, philosophy and economics.\n\nAfter graduating he went straight into a job with the Conservative party, where he rose to become an adviser to Norman Lamont, the-then finance minister.\n\nCameron was by Lamont’s side when he announced Britain was leaving the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on “Black Wednesday” in 1992, one of the most damaging moments in recent Conservative history.\n\nHe later worked as a public relations executive at the Carlton television company for seven years, before being elected to parliament in 2001, when he won the safe rural seat of Witney, near Oxford, in southern England.\n\n‘Detoxifying the party’\n\nOnce a member of parliament, Cameron quickly rose to the top, joining the shadow cabinet in 2004 and becoming party leader in 2005.\n\nHis first task was to “detoxify” the image of the Conservative party, which had been known for its strong views on issues such as controlling immigration and was perceived as unwelcoming to ethnic minorities.\n\nCameron was determined to make the party more centrist and populist, coining the phrase “compassionate Conservatism” to describe his outlook.\n\nHis emphasis on environmentalism and fixing social problems in what he called “broken Britain” were among apparent clear breaks with his party’s past.\n\nBut Labour and other critics accused his tactics of being nothing more than gimmicks.\n\nHowever, the Conservatives’ emphasis changed after Britain’s recession hit in early 2009, changing support for public services into an acknowledgement that quick cuts are needed to reduce record state borrowing.\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats had said such measures were a return to the policies of Margaret Thatcher, the former Conservative prime minister, but Cameron argued they represent a pragmatic response to the country’s financial problems.\n\nEuropean tensions\n\nAs part of his campaign to become party leader in 2005, Cameron vowed that if elected he would leave the European People’s Party group, the main Conservative grouping in the European parliament.\n\nCameron and his wife Samantha are expecting a baby in September [EPA]\n\nAfter being elected leader, he began discussions with right-wing and eurosceptic parties in other European nations, particularly in eastern Europe, eventually leading to the formation of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in 2009.\n\nCurrently comprising 54 members, the ECR stands on a eurosceptic and anti-federalist platform.\n\nCameron and his wife Samantha have two children and are expecting a baby in September 2010.\n\nA third child, Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe epilepsy, died aged six last year."
