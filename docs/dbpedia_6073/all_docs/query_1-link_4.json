        "text": "Parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom since 1983\n\nWitney is a county constituency in Oxfordshire represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament by the first-past-the-post system of election, and was created for the 1983 general election.\n\nHistorically a safe Conservative Party seat for the most part of its existence, it has been represented since 2024 by Charles Maynard of the Liberal Democrats. Its most prominent MP, however, was David Cameron, who was the prime minister from 2010 until his resignation in 2016, and the Leader of the Conservative Party (2005–2016). He represented the constituency from 2001 to 2016.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Bampton East petty sessional division, with Witney at its heart, formed one part of the Woodstock constituency.[4]\n\nUntil 1974, much of the seat remained as part of the Woodstock and latterly Banbury constituency.[5] From 1974 to 1983, the area was included in the Mid Oxfordshire seat along with parts of Bullingdon and Ploughley[citation needed]. Since 1983, Witney has been a full parliamentary seat in its own right and comprises the whole of the District of West Oxfordshire with surrounding villages attached until 1997.\n\nCarterton is the second-largest populated town with 14,000[citation needed] and is situated alongside RAF Brize Norton which is vital to the local economy, being one of the largest and busiest Royal Air Force stations in the country[citation needed].\n\nThe constituency's first MP was Douglas Hurd, who served as a cabinet minister under both Margaret Thatcher and John Major, and retired in 1997. Hurd was succeeded by Shaun Woodward at the 1997 general election. However, Woodward defected to the Labour Party in 1999,[6] and Witney unexpectedly had a Labour MP. Woodward chose not to stand in Witney as a Labour candidate at the next general election and moved to the Labour safe seat of St Helens South instead, following the practice of Alan Howarth in 1997.\n\nAt the 2001 general election, David Cameron was elected as MP for Witney. Cameron was re-elected to a fourth term as MP for the constituency at the 2015 general election with a majority of 25,155, the highest in his political career; on that occasion, his Conservative Party won a surprise overall majority in the House of Commons, taking 330 seats to the opposition Labour Party's 232. However, on 24 June 2016, Cameron announced that he would resign as Prime Minister by that October due to the outcome of the EU Referendum the previous day, in which 51.9% of those who voted supported leaving the EU. Accordingly, Cameron stepped down as premier that July, on the election of Theresa May as Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. On 12 September 2016, it was announced that Cameron would resign as MP for Witney.[7] This triggered a by-election, which was won by Robert Courts, also a Conservative, albeit with a significantly reduced majority. His vote share subsequently rose to 55% at both the 2017 and 2019 general elections.\n\nBefore the 2019 general election, the Liberal Democrats and Green Party agreed not to run against each other as part of a \"Unite to Remain\" alliance.[8] This led to Andrew Prosser, who had been selected as the Green Party's prospective candidate [9] standing down.\n\nBoundaries and boundary changes\n\n[edit]\n\n1983–1997\n\n[edit]\n\nThe District of West Oxfordshire wards of Ascott and Shipton, Aston Bampton and Standlake, Bampton, Bladon and Cassington, Brize Norton and Curbridge, Burford, Carterton North, Carterton South, Chadlington, Charlbury, Chipping Norton, Clanfield and Shilton, Combe and Stonesfield, Ducklington, Enstone, Eynsham, Filkins and Langford, Finstock and Leafield, Freeland and Hanborough, Hailey, Kingham, Milton-under-Wychwood, Minster Lovell, North Leigh, Rollright, Stanton Harcourt, Witney East, Witney North, Witney South, Witney West, and Woodstock; and\n\nThe District of Cherwell wards of Gosford, North West Kidlington, South East Kidlington, and Yarnton.[10]\n\nThe new constituency was largely formed from the majority of the abolished constituency of Mid-Oxon, including the settlements of Witney, Carterton, Woodstock and Kidlington. Chipping Norton and surrounding rural areas were transferred from the Banbury constituency.\n\n1997–2010\n\n[edit]\n\nThe District of West Oxfordshire; and\n\nThe District of Cherwell ward of Yarnton.[11]\n\nThe remaining two wards of the District of West Oxfordshire (Bartons, and Tackley and Wooton) were transferred from Banbury. Kidlington transferred to Oxford West and Abingdon.\n\n2010–2024\n\n[edit]\n\nThe District of West Oxfordshire.\n\nUnder the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the District of Cherwell ward of Yarnton was transferred to Oxford West and Abingdon.[12]\n\n2024-present\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, enacted by the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023, from the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the constituency composed of the following (as they existed on 1 December 2020):\n\nThe District of Vale of White Horse wards of: Faringdon; Kingston Bagpuize; Thames; Watchfield & Shrivenham.\n\nThe District of West Oxfordshire wards of: Alvescot and Filkins; Ascott and Shipton; Bampton and Clanfield; Brize Norton and Shilton; Burford; Carterton North East; Carterton North West; Carterton South; Ducklington; Hailey, Minster Lovell and Leafield; Milton-under-Wychwood; Standlake, Aston and Stanton Harcourt; Witney Central; Witney East; Witney North; Witney South; Witney West.[13]\n\nMajor changes with Chipping Norton and Charlbury to be transferred to Banbury, and Woodstock and surrounding areas to be included in the newly created constituency of Bicester and Woodstock. Partly offset by the transfer in of parts of the District of Vale of White Horse currently in the Wantage constituency, including the town of Faringdon.\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\nElection Member[14] Party 1983 Douglas Hurd Conservative 1997\n\nShaun Woodward\n\nConservative 1999[6] Labour 2001 David Cameron Conservative 2016 by-election Robert Courts Conservative 2024 Charles Maynard Liberal Democrats\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nElections in the 2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 2024: Witney[15][16] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,339 8.6 N/A Turnout 50,584 67.1 –2.6 Registered electors 75,448 Liberal Democrats gain from Conservative Swing +20.4\n\nElections in the 2010s\n\n[edit]\n\n2019 notional result[17] Party Vote % Conservative 28,355 58.1 Liberal Democrats 12,681 26.0 Labour 7,520 15.4 Others 274 0.6 Brexit Party 9 <0.1 Turnout 48,839 69.7 Electorate 70,042\n\nGeneral election 2019: Witney[18] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 15,177 24.7 −10.1 Turnout 61,305 73.1 −0.5 Conservative hold Swing -5.2\n\nGeneral election 2017: Witney[19][20] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 21,241 34.8 −8.2 Turnout 60,927 73.6 +0.3 Conservative hold Swing -4.1\n\nBy-election 2016: Witney[21] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 5,702 14.8 −28.2 Turnout 38,455 46.8 −26.5 Conservative hold Swing -19.3\n\nGeneral election 2015: Witney[22][23][24] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 25,155 43.0 +3.6 Turnout 58,482 73.3 0.0 Conservative hold Swing −1.4\n\nGeneral election 2010: Witney[25] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 22,740 39.4 +12.5 Turnout 57,769 73.3 +4.3 Conservative hold Swing +6.3\n\nElections in the 2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 2005: Witney[26] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 14,156 26.3 +10.1 Turnout 53,869 69.0 +3.1 Conservative hold Swing +0.8\n\nGeneral election 2001: Witney[27] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 7,973 16.2 +3.8 Turnout 49,203 65.9 −10.8 Conservative hold Swing +1.9\n\nElections in the 1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1997: Witney[28][29][30][31] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 7,028 12.4 −27.3 Turnout 56,401 76.7 −4.2 Conservative hold Swing -13.7\n\nGeneral election 1992: Witney[32][33] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 22,568 35.1 +3.4 Turnout 64,306 81.9 +4.6 Conservative hold Swing −2.8\n\nElections in the 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1987: Witney[34][35] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 18,464 31.7 +7.1 Turnout 58,185 77.3 +2.6 Conservative hold Swing +3.6\n\nGeneral election 1983: Witney[36][37] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 12,712 24.6 Turnout 51,823 74.7 Conservative win (new seat)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of parliamentary constituencies in Oxfordshire\n\nList of parliamentary constituencies in the South East England (region)\n\nHenley (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nOxford East (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nOxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nWantage (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nWitney UK Parliament constituency (boundaries April 2010 – May 2024) at MapIt UK\n\nWitney UK Parliament constituency (boundaries from June 2024) at MapIt UK"
