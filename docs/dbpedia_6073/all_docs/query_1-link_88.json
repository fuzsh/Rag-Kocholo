It is an enormous privilege to serve the people of West Oxfordshire,” he said.\n\nHowever he has now U-turned on that pledge. Cameron also insisted he would not quit as PM should he lose the EU referendum.\n\nThe 49-year-old’s decision came as May’s government set out its plans for new grammar schools - a policy Cameron long opposed.\n\nSpeaking about Brexit:, Cameron added today:\n\n“The country made a decision, a decision I advised against, but nonetheless the decision has been made and I want the government to successfully pursue that decision and get it right. As a result, not being a backbencher but leaving parliament is the right thing to do.”\n\nMay said she was “proud to serve in David Cameron’s government” as home secretary.\n\n“Under his leadership we achieved great things. Not just stabilising the economy, but also making great strides in delivering serious social reform,” she said in a statement.\n\n“His commitment to lead a one nation Government is one that I will continue – and I thank him for everything he has done for the Conservative party and the country.\n\nThe prime minister added: “I wish him and his family well for the future.”\n\nFormer Conservative leader and foreign secretary William Hague said Cameron had made the “right” decision. George Osborne also paid tribute."
