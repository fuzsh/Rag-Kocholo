        "text": "Love is Love is Law. It must have certainly been hard. Especially for CJI DYC, ...the ultra-modern, ...unorthodox, ...forward-thinking, ...norm-breaking, ...beloved Judge of our times, ...a Shakespearehead, no less, to deliver an invidiously and assumingly unpopular judgment. But why did the Supreme Court refuse to recognize same-sex marriage at all? Well, because Judiciary cannot legislate. The well-articulated and much awaited judgment (together with the concurring opinions et al), unworthy of reproach, bereft of casuistry, recognized: 1) Queerness as a natural phenomenon known to India since ancient times. 2) The freedom of queer couples to enter into a union as protected by Part III of the Constitution. 3) The failure of the state to recognise the disparate impact on queer couples who cannot marry under the current legal regime. 4) State's obligation under Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution r/w Entry 5 of List III to the 7th Schedule, to grant queer people right to marry 4) The word ‘sex’ under Article 15(1) to include ‘sexual orientation’ 5) Transgender persons in heterosexual relationships to have the right to marry under existing law 6) Intersex persons who identify as either male or female to have the right to marry under existing law 7) Unmarried couples (including queer couples) can jointly adopt a child. (Regulation 5(3) of the Adoption Regulations is ultra vires the JJ Act, Articles 14, and 15). Regulation 5(3) is read down to exclude the word “marital”.) 8) The assurance of the Solicitor General that the Union Government will constitute a Committee of domain knowledge experts for defining and elucidating the scope of the entitlements of queer couples who are in unions: i) to enable partners in a queer relationship to be treated as a part of the same family for the purposes of a ration card; and to have a joint bank account with the option to name the partner as a nominee; ii) In terms of the decision in Common Cause v. Union of India, medical practitioners have a duty to consult family or next of kin or next friend, in the event patients who are terminally ill have not executed an Advance Directive. Parties in a union may be considered ‘family’ for this purpose; iii) Jail visitation rights and the right to access the body of the deceased partner and arrange the last rites; and iv) Legal consequences such as succession rights, maintenance, financial benefits such as under the Income Tax Act 1961, rights flowing from employment such as gratuity and family pension and insurance to be enlarged to include queer couples. You can access the Judgment here- https://lnkd.in/gneBp-xp \"If men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage.\" — ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL\n\nIt has been ten years since the first same sex weddings on 29 March 2014. https://lnkd.in/eQfCJkm4 Traditionally, ten years is celebrated with tin but that doesn't do justice to this hugely important reform which recognised and celebrated same sex relationships and finally put them on the same footing as heterosexual relationships. Whilst the introduction of civil partnerships in 2005 provided same sex couples with the opportunity to secure the same legal entitlements as married couples, the introduction of same sex marriages ensured equal opportunities to chose whether to enter into a civil partnership or marriage. Something that was important to many. https://lnkd.in/exkm9ws8 From a family law perspective, we have welcomed the increase in choices and options, not least because whether people choose civil partnerships or marriages, they are securing important legal rights that offer protection in the event of relationship breakdown. We remain hopeful of future legal reform providing a greater degree of protection for those (whether in same sex or opposite sex relationships) who choose to cohabit. Currently the law offers little protection for them. #gaymarriage #cohabitation #10years #familylaw\n\nMy first comments on the judgment pronounced by the constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Supriyo v. Union of India, also known as same sex couples marriage case. 1. Can the same-sex couples get married in India? No. 2. Can they enter into a relationship and live together without being discriminated? Yes. 3. Can an unmarried couple adopt kids under the Juvenile Justice Act? No Regulation 5(3) framed by CARA under Juvenile Justice Act barring unmarried couples from adoption has been held to be constitutional by majority opinion of Justice Bhat which is agreed by Justice Kohli and Justice Narasimha(who has given his own separate judgment). CJI has held it to be unconstitutional but he is in the minority. Basically, after the judgment, nothing changes legally for same sex couples or unmarried couples(heterosexual or homosexual) who seek to adopt a child. On 1, the constitution bench judgment is emphatic that marriage cannot be recognised nor can the Union be directed to take a decision to grant marital status. Thus, the recognition of status etc, is all talk and little walk when it comes to the real issue of grant of marital status. The judgment directs the Union to frame a committee to determine rights of queer unions. This proposal had actually come from the Union itself during the hearing. So, it is not that the Court can take the sole credit for the same. As far as 2 is concerned, the issue was already settled in Navtej Singh Johar when Section 377 IPC was struck down as unconstitutional. This judgment recognised unemphatically the constitutional protection granted to unmarried couples already and elaborates more on what was already impliedly stated in Naz Foundation. However, 2 is not a constitutional issue for which the bench was initially set up nor was this an unsettled issue before it. As far as 3 is concerned, the position remains the same in light of the majority view and only married couples can adopt a child under Indian law. There are 4 separate judgments. Hence, the majority opinion on 2 and 3 would need to be conjured after reading the judgments separately. As far as 1 is concerned, everyone is ad idem that same sex marriage cannot be recognised. #samesexmarriage #marriage #supremecourtofindia #queerrights #law #courts\n\nPerfect! this had to happen, was waiting for it for too long. Every moment of enunciation of the Judgement in \"Plea of Marriage Equality\" was disappointing and unbearable. It was such an erroneous judgement, prima facie discriminatory. Furthermore, making excuses that Courts can't intervene in absence of Statute is not a valid justification because the Petition was filed only because there was no statute providing for the same in the first place. Certainly, a right which is an intrinsic part and read under Article 21, by several High Courts which are not to mention also Constitutional courts and empowered under Article 226 to enforce Fundamental Rights, cannot be derogated to not be a Fundamental right by vague definitions and mere forbearance. Obviously this can't happen that a particular right becomes 'Fundamental' for heterosexual couples who after eloping pray for protection of the State through Courts and becomes not even a matter of \"Legal Right\" which one can claim when it comes to 'homosexuals'. A right that is available to heterosexuals should equally be available to same-sex couples because the Constitution provides for that, not the Courts and certainly not the Legislature or the Society. (GOSH! HOMOPHOBES PROMOTING HOMOPHOBIA) It is a matter of right and deserves utmost respect and protection with an enactment of fresh law, separately for same-sex couples, leaving SMA alone to be rubbed on the faces of those who need that. And Mind you! what we need is not just 'Civil Union' or mere left-overs, a full-fledged \"Marriage\" with all the instances and legal rights is the need of the hour. Let's see how the Courts escape this time and on what grounds and justifications. Or maybe, just maybe, uphold this decision and retrieve this right from heterosexuals as well, and stop extending protection to inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. THEN WE'LL TALK. LOL! Cheers in advance! who knows we might see a lot of gay-marriages this season. 🌈"
