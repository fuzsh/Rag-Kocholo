        "text": "David Cameron, the former British prime minister who stepped down in May 2016 after the country voted to leave the European Union, has quit politics.\n\nHe becomes the latest in a string of high-profile figures in the Brexit debate to decline any part in seeing it through to fruition.\n\nDavid Cameron didn’t want the country to leave the EU, and when his campaign was defeated he immediately stepped down as leader of the country and of his Conservative Party. But he did call and oversee the referendum—planning to guide the country to a “remain” vote—and will be remembered as the prime minister who took Britain out of the EU. He pledged in 2013 to hold the referendum, saying he believed in “confronting this issue,” in an attempt to stave off the threat from the right-wing, pro-Brexit UKIP party (and reportedly made that fateful decision over pizza in Chicago’s O’Hare Airport.) Today, he resigned as a member of parliament, or MP, meaning that he is, for now, leaving politics altogether.\n\n“You will admit now, though, won’t you, you will be remembered mostly for taking this country out of the European Union?” the BBC asked Cameron. “Well, I’m sure I’ll be remembered for keeping that pledge” to hold a referendum, Cameron replied.\n\nCameron’s decision to leave politics at the age of 49 after only 15 years as an MP has sparked speculation that he’s planning to get a high-paying corporate job. He said he hadn’t yet decided what to do next."
