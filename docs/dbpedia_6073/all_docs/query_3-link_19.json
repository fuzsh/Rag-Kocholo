        "text": "Who is the current chief of staff?\n\nSue Gray is the current Downing Street chief of staff. She is a former senior civil servant and was previously director general, propriety and ethics at the Cabinet Office, permanent secretary in the Northern Ireland executive’s Department of Finance and, most recently, second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office. As part of this latter role, Sue Gray led the investigation into the Downing Street ‘partygate’ scandal.\n\nGray became chief of staff to Keir Starmer, then leader of the opposition, in 2023. As a recent civil servant, her appointment was controversial (though not entirely without precedent). ACOBA – the body that oversees post-government appointments for ministers and senior civil servants – warned that ‘there remains a potential risk to the perceived impartiality of the Civil Service’ and recommend a six-month waiting period between Gray leaving government and commencing her duties. This period ended in September 2023, when Sue Gray formally took up her role.\n\nHow and when did the chief of staff role arise?\n\nThe ‘chief of staff’ title is originally a military term. In 1953, President Eisenhower became the first US president to appoint a political chief staff, and the role has continued in the US ever since. Margaret Thatcher was the first UK prime minister to appoint a chief of staff – David Wolfson (later Lord Wolfson) – in 1979. Wolfson had been director of Great Universal Stores, and then secretary to the shadow cabinet, prior to his appointment. He was one of Thatcher’s closest aides, describing his job as “making her aware of the few things that mattered and to make sure she saw the right people at the right time.” Wolfson left the role in 1985 and the position was left vacant.\n\nTony Blair re-introduced the chief of staff role to Downing Street when he became prime minister in 1997, appointing Jonathan Powell, who had previously worked as a senior diplomat.\n\nUnlike political appointees before him, Powell was given unprecedented powers to issue orders to civil servants. He wielded considerable influence during his 10 years, playing an important role in negotiating the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\nWho else has been Downing Street chief of staff?\n\nWhen Blair resigned, Powell stood down as chief of staff. Gordon Brown experimented with different models of the chief of staff role during his time as prime minister. First, he temporarily appointed civil servant Tom Scholar (later Sir Tom Scholar) as both Downing Street chief of staff and his principal private secretary, marking a move away from Blair’s introduction of a US-style chief of staff.\n\nIn January 2008, at the point of Scholar’s planned departure, senior civil servant Jeremy Heywood (later Lord Heywood) took on the principal private secretary role and Stephen Carter (later Lord Carter), formerly CEO of Ofcom, became chief of strategy and principal adviser to the prime minister – de facto chief of staff. Carter had been a member of the Labour Party prior to taking up his position at Ofcom, and rejoined the party upon his appointment as chief of staff.\n\nCarter only stayed in the post until October 2008 and, although it is sometimes claimed that Heywood became chief of staff for the remainder of Brown’s premiership, he told the IfG that this was not the case. The position was left vacant until Gordon Brown left office.\n\nWhen David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, he appointed Conservative adviser Edward Llewellyn (later Lord Llewellyn), who had worked for him in opposition, as his chief of staff. Llewellyn was part of a small team that negotiated a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats.\n\nAfter David Cameron’s resignation and Theresa May’s appointment as prime minister in 2016, Conservative special advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill became joint chiefs of staff. While at No.10, they gained a reputation in the media and among staff for exerting a tight grip on power on May’s behalf. When the Conservatives lost their majority in the 2017 general election, under pressure from the parliamentary party, they were replaced by former minister Gavin Barwell (later Lord Barwell). Barwell has since written a book about his experience in No.10.\n\nBoris Johnson did not appoint a formal chief of staff when he became prime minister in July 2019. However, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, was seen as his de facto chief of staff. When Cummings left Downing Street amid internal turmoil in November 2020, Lord Udny-Lister – who had served as Johnson’s chief of staff when he was mayor of London – became the prime minister’s acting chief of staff, until Dan Rosenfield took over in January 2021.\n\nBefore becoming chief of staff, Rosenfield previously worked as a civil servant in the Treasury, acting as principal private secretary to chancellors of the exchequer Alistair Darling and George Osborne, and later as an investment banker. Despite his civil service background, Rosenfield was appointed politically as a special adviser by the prime minister. In February 2022, Rosenfield resigned, along with two other senior special advisers at No.10. In December 2021, it had been reported that Rosenfield had attended at least one of the Downing Street Christmas parties in December 2020.\n\nThe only sitting MP and government minister to have served as chief of staff was Steve Barclay, who held the role from February to July 2022 while serving as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, minister for the cabinet office, and MP for North East Cambridgeshire. This garnered considerable attention in the media and from the opposition, with questions raised as to how Barclay would find the time to fulfil all of the above roles. After Steve Barclay resigned from the Johnson government in July 2022, Baroness Finn served briefly as chief of staff.\n\nWhen Liz Truss became prime minister in September 2022, she appointed Mark Fullbrook, a former adviser to Boris Johnson and founder of lobbying firm Fullbrook Strategies as her chief of staff. Fullbrook’s appointment was controversial given his lobbying background and plans made to pay him for the role through his firm.\n\nRishi Sunak’s chief of staff was Liam Booth-Smith, who had served as an adviser to Sunak during his time as chancellor and ran both of his 2022 leadership bids. His year and eight months in post meant that he outlasted all of his six most recent predecessors."
