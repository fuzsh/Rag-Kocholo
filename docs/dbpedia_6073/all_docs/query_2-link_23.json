        "text": "David Cameron has proved the doubters in his own party and beyond wrong by winning a majority of his own at the 2015 general election.\n\nWhen he was elected Conservative leader in 2005, he was seen as the party's answer to Tony Blair, a young, modern leader, who would shake off the party's \"nasty\" image and turn it back into the election winning machine that had dominated much of 20th century British politics.\n\nBut despite big advances at the 2010 election, he was forced to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, handing ammunition to those on the right of the party who hated his brand of \"Liberal Conservatism\" and yearned for a more traditional Tory programme.\n\nMr Cameron's presentational skills were never in doubt.\n\nHis easy charm and ability to appear \"prime ministerial\" at news conferences and summits helped ensure his personal poll ratings remained well ahead of the Conservative Party's ratings.\n\nBut critics complained that it was difficult to pin down what he actually believed in.\n\n\"I'm a practical person, and pragmatic. I know where I want to get to, but I am not ideologically attached to one particular method,\" December 2005.\n\n\"I'm going to be as radical a social reformer as Mrs Thatcher was an economic reformer,\" August 2008.\n\n\"I don't support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative,\" July 2013.\n\n\"I hope they'd say I'm optimistic, I enjoy life and that I'm fun. But also that I'm quite driven in doing what I believe in,\" on what his friends would say about him,\" February 2015.\n\n\"We will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. That means ensuring this recovery reaches all parts of our country, from north to south, to east to west,\" May 2015.\n\nThey have three young children, Nancy, Arthur, and Florence, who was born shortly after the family moved into Downing Street.\n\nTheir first child, Ivan, who was born profoundly disabled and needed round-the-clock care, died in February 2009.\n\nThe experience of caring for Ivan and witnessing at first hand the dedication of NHS hospital staff, is said by friends to have broadened Mr Cameron's horizons. He had, friends say, led an almost charmed life, to that point.\n\nOn entering Parliament in 2001, Mr Cameron rose rapidly through the ranks, serving first on the Home Affairs Select Committee, which recommended the liberalisation of drug laws.\n\nHe was taken under the wing of Michael Howard, who put him in charge of policy co-ordination and then made him shadow education secretary. He also had the key role of drafting the 2005 Conservative election manifesto.\n\nBut when he entered the race to succeed Mr Howard as party leader in 2005 few initially gave him a chance. He was a distant fourth at the bookmakers behind Ken Clarke, Liam Fox and frontrunner David Davis.\n\nIt took an eye-catching conference speech, delivered without notes, in what would become his trademark style, to change the minds of the party faithful.\n\nBefore he was elected Conservative leader in 2005, David Cameron famously described himself as the \"heir to Blair\".\n\nThere are certainly similarities with the way he has used a small group of modernisers to force change on a reluctant party, even if it did not, in the end, produce the same seismic effect at the ballot box.\n\nThe coalition he formed with Mr Clegg functioned better than anyone expected, managing to complete a full five-year term and introduce sweeping changes to the education system, the NHS, the benefits system, pensions and much else besides.\n\nMr Clegg took a big hit in the opinion polls over unpopular coalition policies such as the massive cuts to public spending aimed at paying off the deficit, while Mr Cameron earned praise for his statesmanlike handling of set-piece events, such as his Commons statement on the Bloody Sunday inquiry.\n\nTo the surprise of many, possibly including himself, the greatest difficulties he encountered were not in managing the coalition with the Lib Dems but with keeping control of the increasingly vocal and rebellious right-wing of his own party.\n\nHis decision to promise a referendum on Britain's membership was seen as an attempt to placate right-wingers and stem the rise of UKIP.\n\nBut there was still a sizeable minority on the Tory backbenches who did not trust Mr Cameron and hated their party's alliance with the Lib Dems.\n\nIn August 2013, he suffered a major blow to his authority when he became the first prime minister in more than 100 years to lose a foreign policy vote, after dozens of Conservative MPs joined forces with Labour to block his plans for military intervention in Syria.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest crisis of his premiership came in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014, when he cancelled Prime Minister's Questions to rush north of the border in an effort to save the Union, after a poll suggested the Yes campaign would win.\n\nHe was later forced to issue an apology to the Queen, after he was overheard telling New York mayor Michael Bloomberg Her Majesty had \"purred down the line\" when he informed her that Scotland had rejected independence.\n\nFor some, his handling of the referendum issue, by offering last-minute concessions to the nationalists, added to the idea of Mr Cameron as an \"essay crisis\" prime minister, who only gets fully engaged with an issue when all seems lost.\n\nIt was a criticism that came back to haunt him during the 2015 election campaign, which began with him musing about his desire not to serve a third term.\n\nOnly when the polls refused to budge, said the critics, did he roll up his sleeves and begin to display the passion some said had been lacking from his early performances.\n\nBut the late swing to the Conservatives that confounded the opinion pollsters and allowed him to form the first Tory government since John Major's in 1992 will be seen as a vindication of his risk-averse campaign strategy - his refusal to debate Labour leader Ed Miliband head-to-head and relentless focus on a handful of simple messages, in particular his \"long-term economic plan\".\n\nMr Cameron has always insisted that he works as hard as any of the previous residents of Number 10 and retains his zeal for social reform and the NHS, recently describing improving the health service as his \"life's work\".\n\nHe has always defended the coalition too - paying tribute to Nick Clegg in his victory speech on the steps of Downing Street - even though he increasingly spoke of his frustration at not being able to govern as a true Conservative prime minister.\n\nAll those who have wondered what he might have done had he been given a free hand, what sort of prime minister he might have been, will find out in the weeks and months ahead."
