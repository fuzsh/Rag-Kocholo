“Baywatch” babe and former Kid Rock spouse Pamela Anderson stepped out Wednesday in a short-short haircut.

Anderson, recognized for her three biggest assets – one of them being her long, messy blond bedhead tresses, looked downright conservative in a high-necked sweater and a pixie haircut.

In fact, she looked more like Charlize Theron, omg! reported. Theron has kept her blond locks short since shaving her head for her part in “Mad Max” in 2012, according to the article.

Anderson was with her latest ex-husband, Rick Salomon, a “friends with benefits,” with whom she annulled her marriage in 2008, the article said.

She was married to Tommy Lee of Motley Crue from 1995-1998. Next she was engaged to model Marcus Schenkenberg (they broke up in 2001); followed by marriage to Kid Rock (Romeo, Mich., native Robert Ritchie) in 2006, and divorced five months later. She married Salomon the next year.
