She was once Pamela Anderson Lee. Now actress Pamela Anderson is Mrs. Kid Rock.

The former “Baywatch” babe wed the rock star Saturday in St. Tropez, Anderson’s spokeswoman, Ann Gurrola, told The Associated Press.

Anderson, 39, and Kid Rock, 35, were engaged in Las Vegas in 2002 but split up the following year.

Anderson and her first husband, rock star Tommy Lee, divorced in 1998 after three years of marriage. They have two sons, Brandon, 10, and Dylan, 8.

Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, has a 13-year-old son, Bob Jr.
