        "text": "Pamela Anderson’s love life has been under the microscope for a long time, but there's been a resurgence in interest over the past few years. That's thanks, in part, to productions like the Hulu series Pam & Tommy, which explored the Baywatch alum’s intense relationship with musician Tommy Lee. And now, Pamela is telling her side of the story in the new Netflix documentary that just dropped, Pamela, A Love Story.\n\nThe documentary explores Pamela’s relationship with Tommy, and also reclaims her narrative after she was rocked by a sex tape scandal in the late ‘90s. “I’m not the damsel in distress,” she says in the trailer. “I put myself in crazy situations and survived them.”\n\nThere's a lot more to Pamela's relationships than her infamous sex tape. Over the years, she's been criticized for her many divorces, but a source close to the Baywatch star said that \"Pam loves weddings. The divorces aren't that hard to her.\"\n\n\"She's very quick to pull the trigger. How quick is she to undo the trigger? She realizes things weren't meant to be,\" the source continued, per People. \"She does whatever she wants and doesn't worry about how society looks at it.\"\n\nSo, is Pamela Anderson still married today? Here's everything to know about her full dating history and husbands:\n\nTommy Lee was Pamela's first husband.\n\nAnd their story is about to play a major role in the Netflix doc, so buckle up. Pamela met Tommy Lee in Dec. 1994, per Us Weekly. A month and a half later, they escaped to Cancún, Mexico, and were married 96 hours after they arrived.\n\nPamela Anderson and Tommy Lee in 1995.\n\nWhen the pair returned to California, an electrician stole a sex tape from Lee's home, beginning the infamous scandal that Pam & Tommy is based on. The pair later had two sons, Brandon and Dylan, before divorcing in 1998.\n\n“Not being able to do anything … about [the tape] was adding so much frustration and stress to our relationship,” Pamela explained on an episode of 20/20 in 2014, according to to Us Weekly. “It was just consuming us.”\n\nIn her memoir, Love, Pamela (which was excerpted by People magazine), the star writes that “my relationship with Tommy may have been the only time I was ever truly in love.”\n\n\"We had fun,\" she writes in the book, \"and our rule was no rules.\"\n\nBut Pamela also says the pressure and stress of the sex tape came to a head one night in 1998, when Tommy twisted her arm as she was holding their 7-month-old son, Dylan, while their older son Brandon played nearby. “Tommy ripped Brandon off me and threw me and Dylan into a wall,” she said, noting that she called 911. Tommy was arrested and served six months in jail.\n\n\"The divorce from Tommy was the hardest, lowest, most difficult point of my life,\" she says in her book. \"I was crushed. I still couldn't believe that the person I loved the most was capable of what had happened that night. We were both devastated, but I had to protect my babies.\"\n\nNow, Pamela says that she and Tommy “check in, every once in a while,\" adding, “Tommy is the father of my kids and I'm forever grateful.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, Pamela Anderson married Kid Rock.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Pamela dated Swedish model Marcus Schenkenberg, per ABC News. The pair eventually got engaged, but broke up in 2001, Us Weekly reported.\n\nSoon after, she started dating singer and rapper Kid Rock. The pair got engaged in 2002 but split in 2003. Then, three years later, they officially tied the knot on a yacht near Saint-Tropez, France in July.\n\nPamela Anderson and Kid Rock on their wedding day in 2006.\n\nLater that fall, Pamela filed for divorce—just 17 days after publicly announcing that she had had a miscarriage, per Us Weekly.\n\nApparently, Pamela's involvement in Sacha Baron Cohen's satirical documentary film, Borat, caused some early tension with the couple, the New York Post via CBS reported at the time. During a private screening of the film, a source told the outlet that Kid Rock \"didn't like it\" and started yelling at Pam.\n\nIn 2007, Pamela married her third husband, a professional poker player.\n\nNext, Pamela married Rick Salomon, a professional poker player and film producer. The couple first wed in Oct. 2007, and then separated in December. Their marriage was officially annulled in 2008.\n\nLater that year, Tommy Lee told Rolling Stone that Pamela and the boys had moved back in with him. \"It's awesome, man. It's definitely working. You can tell on the kids' faces — they're happy when we're together,\" he said. \"We've only given it a try 800 times — 801, here we go.\"\n\nBut their reunion was short-lived: The duo called things off for good in 2010, Us Weekly confirmed.\n\nIn 2013, Pamela and Rick reunited and were married for the second time in 2014. That summer, they called it off again before filing for divorce again in 2015. \"She doesn't know what she wants and he's too nice for her. She likes bad boys,\" a source told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nPamela Anderson and Rick Salomon in 2014.\n\nThings got messy between the two afterward with Pamela filing a restraining order against Rick, per TMZ. In court documents obtained by TMZ, Pamela alleged that Rick tried to strangle her and smother her with a pillow during sex, while he claimed that she had numerous abortions.\n\nIn 2020, she married her fourth husband, who she met in the 80s.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2020, Pamela, 52, married producer Jon Peters, 74, in a secret ceremony, according to The Hollywood Reporter. After dating more than 30 years ago, the duo rekindled their romance just as the COVID-19 pandemic began and tied the knot.\n\n“There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but—for 35 years—I’ve only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild—in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated,\" Peters told the outlet.\n\nPamela Anderson and Jon Peters in 1989.\n\nPamela announced her love for Peters in a poem: \"Jon is the original ‘bad boy’ of Hollywood–no one compares–I love him deeply like family,\" she wrote. Then, 12 days later, the couple broke up. Their marriage license was never made official, according to the Los Angeles Times, making the split quick and easy.\n\nIn Jan. 2022, Pamela announced that she was splitting from her fifth husband.\n\nOn Christmas Eve of 2020, Pamela wed her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst, per People. They were together for about a year before breaking up in 2022.\n\n\"I think they had a lot in common,\" a source told People. \"But they fell out of love.\"\n\nWho else has Pamela dated over the years?\n\nThe list of men vying for Pamela's heart over the past few decades is a long one. It includes Dancing With The Stars alum Marcus Schenkenberg, whom she was allegedly engaged to between 2000 and 2001, and soccer player Adil Rami in 2017.\n\nRami and Pamela broke up in 2019, though, when she wrote on Instagram that he was \"living a double life\" (he has denied this claim).\n\nIs Pamela married now?\n\nNo, Pamela is not currently married or dating anyone. She has, however, been busy starring in films and making her documentary, according to IMDb.\n\nPamela also seems happy being single. She currently lives on her grandparents’ former farmhouse on Vancouver Island with her five dogs. “I live a more romantic life now that I'm alone than I did in relationships,\" she told People. “l light my candles, have my music playing. I have my piano, I'm sure it would be lovely if someone else was in my life and wanted the same thing but I've just never met them. It's usually about catering to them, and there has to be a balance.”\n\nPamela, A Love Story dropped on Netflix on Jan. 31."
