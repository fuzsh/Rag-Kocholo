        "text": "Canadian actress Pamela Anderson stretches before her wedding ceremony aboard a yacht in St Tropez, southern France, July 29, 2006. Anderson is wedding U.S musician Kid Rock. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard (FRANCE)\n\nActress Pamela Anderson has married singer Kid Rock on a yacht near the French Riviera city of St. Tropez, celebrity magazine People said on Saturday.\n\nThe former Playboy model announced her engagement to the Detroit rap-rocker on her Web site last week.\n\n\"Yes, I'm finally getting remarried ... I'm in love. I'm happy,\" Anderson wrote on the site, www.pamelaanderson.com.\n\nAnderson, 39, and Rock, 35, whose recordings include 1998's \"Devil Without a Cause,\" have been romantically linked since the early 2000s but broke off their relationship in 2003. That had been seen together recently vacationing along the Riviera.\n\nThe blonde actress, who was discovered while watching a Canadian football game and gained international stardom in the 1990s on the television show \"Baywatch,\" was previously married to drummer Tommy Lee of rock band Motley Crue, with whom she had two sons."
