        "text": "Loretta Lynn clearly had a twinkle in her eye this weekend. The country queen, 88, got fans all stirred up on Sunday with a social media post that said she’d gotten hitched to her good buddy Kid Rock, 49.\n\n“What a weekend!” Lynn said on her Facebook page. “My Ernie & Crystal renewed their vows this weekend. It was beautiful and everything it should be. Marriage isn’t always easy -- heck it’s not even always pretty, but love holds you together and you push through the bad days to enjoy the good ones. I’m so proud of them and wish them years of happiness. Things got crazy then -- my boy Kid Rock was there and we’ve always teased about getting ourselves married. Well, the preacher was already there so we had some fun with it. Sorry girls, he’s taken now! #gottahavesomefun #88andfeelinggreat #laugh #tabloidfodder #cougar”\n\nSeveral photos commemorating the moment were posted on Lynn’s Facebook page, as well.\n\nFans of the Coal Miner’s Daughter quickly got into the spirit, cheering her on with thousands of likes, shares and comments on Facebook. Here’s a sampling:\n\n“I am from Harlan County Kentucky. I love you Loretta and I think Kid Rock is amazing, the only thing that bothers me with him is the cussing but that’s just the way he is. I know hardly anyone ever reads these comments but if they should ever read mine, I hope they let you know that you are and always have been my favorite woman Country singer, hands down. You always have been ever since I was a little girl. God bless you Ms. Loretta, your family and Kid Rock.” -- Marilyn Rice Daniels\n\n“Loretta you are probably the only person that has made Kid Rock Blush. I have a Question? Is there anything you haven’t done in your lifetime that you regret not doing. I have loved you my whole life.” -- Leisa Brown\n\n“Absolutely love this, that smile on Loretta ’s face is worth everything, so much happiness there, way to go Kid Rock, class act.” -- Linda Herring Harlow\n\n“No Loretta, say it isn’t so! Love Kid Rock, he was supposed to be my next husband. You look great and Kid Rock looks hot as ever. Both of you are great singers and performers as I’ve been to concerts performed by each of you. I even met you and Ernie once in person .... when I was sister-in-law to one of your band members. On my bucket list is to meet Kid Rock.” -- Deb Connor\n\n“Love it Loretta! You’re such an inspiration to country girls everywhere! Can’t think of anyone better to lose our favorite fella to!” -- Christy Claywell\n\n“So are you going to change your name to Loretta Rock?” -- Mark-Stephanie Haynes\n\n“He is the luckiest man on the planet!!! You are so beautiful Mrs. Rock, I mean Lynn! My Grandma was named Loretta and she took me to see Coal Miners Daughter at the movie theatre. Ever since I swore I would see you in concert but it never happened. My Gran really loved you! And loved how I knew so many sweet and funny lines of the movie by heart and would quote them to her outta no where. Thank you for being you, it’s always a gift to hear you speak or sing! Love and hugs from Ohio!” -- Michelle Affholter\n\n“Sorry Loretta, but you ain’t woman enough to take my man #kidrock” -- Tonya Abernathy Dawson\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Lynn admitted what folks had known all along -- that she was just joshing about her “marriage” to the rock-rap-country star.\n\n“Well, it didn’t last long, y’all but it sure was fun!” Lynn posted on Facebook. I guess I better get on here and let y’all know that it was just a joke — Kid Rock and I didn’t get married over the weekend, but we had a blast. #rockon #relaxoutthere #easymediafolks #calmdown #funtimes #whatwillshedonext #its2020soyouneverknow #iputhispictureaway”\n\nLynn’s granddaughter, Tayla Lynn, also posted about the mock nuptials on Instagram, saying, “Now you must understand how close Kid and Memaw have gotten. Like they adore each other. They joke around all the time about getting married and saying to heck with the rest of em. So Dad and Crystal decide to make that happen! They have the preacher announce that he’s ready to do the vows now! Memaw and Kid both become giddy. Like school kids. They were so caught off guard but both so happy.”\n\nLynn was married to Oliver Vanetta Lynn, Jr. -- better known as “Dolittle” or “Mooney” -- for almost 50 years. (He died in 1996.) Their relationship was famously detailed in Loretta’s 1976 autobiography, “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” and in a 1980 hit movie based on the book, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nLoretta and Dolittle had six children together, including Ernest Ray “Ernie” Lynn, 69, who evidently renewed his vows with wife Crystal this weekend.\n\nKid Rock has been romantically linked with several women throughout his career, but only tied the knot with one, actress Pamela Anderson. Their marriage in 2006 was brief, lasting just a few months.\n\nLynn and Rock made a few public appearances together last year, teaming up for the 2019 Nashville Songwriters Awards at the Ryman Auditorium in September, and riding together in a Christmas parade in Leipers Fork, Tennessee."
