        "text": "PAMELA Anderson once found herself in a bedroom with seven naked models who wanted to watch her have sex with Hugh Hefner, she has revealed.\n\nThe former Baywatch actor says the experience was the craziest she ever had at the Playboy Mansion, The Sun reports.\n\nAnderson first found fame as a ­Playboy Playmate in the ’80s, and the incident took place at a party thrown by magazine founder Hefner at his Los Angeles pad.\n\nShe says she initially had no idea she was expected to get involved with the orgy, believing she was just there to watch the seven Playboy ­models romp with the Lothario.\n\nShe said: “Everyone was naked in the grotto and the girls were ­downstairs and they all went upstairs.\n\n“I followed them upstairs. I thought, ‘What could be going on up here?’ Seven girls, one at a time with Hef.\n\n“I was stood at the end of the bed watching them and then I realised they were watching me. I thought, ‘This is not a movie. I need to leave.’”\n\nThe mum-of-two, now 50, continued: “I have seen a lot of ­craziness at the Playboy Mansion.\n\n“He had a lot of women around. There were these big TV screens with crazy things going on with him and the girls and baby oil.”\n\nBut Anderson, who is now a ­political activist, never felt exploited by Hefner, who died last year at 91.\n\nShe said: “He was a pioneer. A true gentleman and he was charming. He loved women and he empowered women.\n\n“He was very forward-thinking and created his own life. Nobody could copy him. It was nothing salacious. I thought it was very innocent.”\n\nThe Canadian actor was supposed to catch up with her former boss on a trip to Los Angeles last year, but he died before they could meet again.\n\nBut Anderson has moving memories of him, including her most recent photo shoot for his magazine in 2015.\n\nShe said: “The last cover I did with Playboy, he walked in and he tried not to let me see this but he was in a lot of pain on a walker. He was so important to me. He was amazing. He was very accepting of who you are.\n\n“There were all types of beautiful girls of all shapes and sizes. It was erotic and playful but innocent.”\n\nAnderson shares the revelations on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories on ITV tomorrow night — in an interview she claimed last month had been edited down to just being about “my body parts and men”.\n\nBut on Loose Women this week Morgan, 52, hit back at the complaint, insisting: “She hasn’t seen the recording.”\n\nIn the interview, she also reveals she complained to Hefner about powerful Hollywood men pressuring her for sex, and she says he always backed her up.\n\nBut she says her fellow Playmates were furious at her — fearing outing the pests would cost them work.\n\nShe said: “I have had men say, ‘Come back to my hotel room and audition with me. If you don’t come I will give it to the girl across the hall.’\n\n“And then they have ended up giving the role to a girl across the hall.\n\n“People have said, ‘Pamela, come and join us in the jacuzzi and I will give you $100,000.’ And I have said, ‘I think that is more than just the jacuzzi. I am calling Hef.’\n\n“The girls would say, ‘Stop calling Hef.’ Some girls would say they make a little extra money this way but not me.”\n\nAnderson also revealed she believes her film career was destroyed by disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein because she answered back to him.\n\nShe added: “He was not inappropriate to me in a sexual way.\n\n“But over the phone he was threatening. And I didn’t work again because I stood up to him.”\n\nON VLADIMIR PUTIN\n\nAnderson shocked the studio audience during her interview on Piers Morgan’s show by hinting at a possible romance with ­Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nShe first came into contact with the then-PM in 2009 when she successfully ­lobbied him to ban the hunting of seals and importing products made from their fur.\n\nAnderson revealed the Russian leader then invited her to his presidential inauguration in 2012 as his special guest.\n\nBut when quizzed over whether she had a relationship with the Russian, her teasing denials clearly surprised the audience.\n\nShe said: “No ... no, but he wanted me to actually come to his inauguration and give him flowers. I was going to give him flowers on his inauguration.\n\n“No, I did not do that. But there has been some ... obviously we have been in the same place together ­sometimes.”\n\nAnd when the studio audience began to gasp, she added: “It’s starting to feel surreal to me too. Am I lying? Am I telling the truth? I don’t know.”\n\nWhen Piers pushed her further on rumours of a romantic liaison, she concluded: “I have a great relationship with Russia. Yes.”\n\nON JULIAN ASSANGE\n\nAnderson floundered when asked if she had been in a relationship with Julian Assange, 46, and ducked giving a denial.\n\nThe actor has visited the WikiLeaks founder several times at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he has been holed up for almost six years avoiding extradition on now-dropped rape charges.\n\nQuizzed about a romance, she said: “Well he is a prisoner. It is difficult to have a ­relationship with somebody. I adore him.”\n\nBut when Piers pushed her on whether they had or had not been an item, she declared: “No ... I don’t want to talk about that. You are so persistent. I am too honest.”\n\nShe added: “Mostly we are very good friends. Very good friends. That’s it. That’s all I want to say.”\n\nON MICHAEL JACKSON\n\nMichael Jackson superfan Anderson used to go out with the King of Pop — but just as friends.\n\nThe actor said that as a young girl she had a crush on the superstar, who died in 2009, but when they eventually met they never had a “romantic entanglement”.\n\nShe said: “I always thought I was going to marry Michael Jackson. When I was little I had pictures of him all over my wall. He was an idol of mine. I loved him.\n\n“We went out, but not on dates. He was such an amazing soul and was very ­complimentary. He was flattering.”\n\nAsked by Piers if she and Michael had ever kissed, she paused — provoking the former Britain’s Got Talent judge to claim she had “given it away”.\n\nBut she insisted: “No. Only in my mind. It was a brief friendship. I did not know him that well. He always had good things to say. He was always sweet. He loved what I did.\n\n“He always said, ‘I love what you are trying to accomplish.’ We had a mutual interest in each other.\n\n“He thought I was interesting.”\n\nON HER BOYFRIEND\n\nAnderson says she is loving her new life in France with Marseilles footballer Adil Rami.\n\nShe recently moved into the defender’s home in the southern French city and reveals she has been known to cook for him in a sexy maid’s ­uniform.\n\nShe said: “I live my dream. You have to be very brave and enjoy things.\n\n“He is fantastic. I love him, of course. I probably should not be talking about it. I am so bad. I have no filter. So bad. You are so good. It is what it is. I am happy in France.”\n\nAnderson has previously been married to Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee, singer Kid Rock and poker player Rick Salomon. She has two sons with Tommy — ­Brandon, 21, and Dylan, 20.\n\nAnd she has not ruled out Adil, who is 18 years her junior, being husband number four.\n\nShe said: “I do want to get married again in my lifetime. But I have been married a lot. I don’t like the phrase ‘toyboy’.\n\n“I care about him a lot and we get along. It is important to get along in the moment. Who knows how long this world is going to last with the way it is going.\n\n“You might as well enjoy your life.”\n\nON SYLVESTER STALLONE\n\nRocky star Sylvester Stallone once tried to get Anderson to be his girlfriend by offering her an apartment and a car.\n\nThe actor revealed: “He offered me a condo and a Porsche to be his ‘number one girl’.\n\nI said, ‘Does that mean there is a ­number two?’ He said, ‘Of course.’\n\n“He is very funny. I did not take the condo or the Porsche. Maybe I should have.”\n\nAnd she jokingly said that she needs different men for different uses.\n\nShe said: “My aunt used to say, ‘One man can’t do it all. One for sex, one for conversation, one for entertainment.’\n\n“I have a romantic relationship but I have men in other parts of my life who stimulate other parts of me.”\n\nON HER LOOKS\n\nAnderson might be well known for her boob job, but says she has never let cosmetic surgeons touch her face.\n\nAnd while she once tried Botox, the results were so bad she now steers clear.\n\nThe 50-year-old said: “I spent a third of my life in a make-up chair and now I do my own make-up in five minutes. Less is more and I can’t believe I said that.\n\n“My mum says as you get older, don’t wear so much make-up. My face is natural.\n\n“No plastic surgery but facials and lasers. There are lots of good tricks you can do now.\n\n“I have tried Botox and I looked ­terrible. I have a big forehead so it is not a good option for me.”\n\nIn her early days with Playboy, Anderson boosted her bust size to 34DD and says she owes her career to her enhanced boobs.\n\nShe explained: “Well, they got me in the door.\n\n“My breasts have had a career of their own and I just came along. It has always been an interesting fascination and they kind of expand on camera.”\n\nBut the actor admitted she had never felt that she was a real looker.\n\nShe said: “I never felt beautiful. I was always pretty shy.\n\n“When I look at pictures it is not like I am looking at me. Great beauty is Sophia Loren, Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe. I love the old movie stars.\n\n“When I look in the mirror? I do a little bit. I am much thinner. I think I could look better.”\n\nON STALKERS\n\nAnderson has described how a deranged stalker once broke into her house and put on her famous red Baywatch swimsuit.\n\nThe actor said the female fan broke into her Los Angeles home and managed to stay secretly in an unused guest room for three days before she was discovered.\n\nAsked about fans, she said: “I have had some dangerous ones who have come into my house. I found a woman once in my bed. She broke in and was living in my guest room for three days.\n\n“My mother was coming to LA for surgery and my dad came and I was preparing a room for him and there was a woman in there with bleached blond hair and she was ­wearing a Baywatch bathing suit tucked in bed.\n\n“She had written a letter saying: ‘I am not a lesbian. I just want to touch you.’”\n\nAnderson hired around-the-clock security after the breach in 2001, despite cops saying there was no real risk.\n\nShe added of the intruder: “She came from a nice family.\n\n“The police said she was a woman and was not going to hurt me but I said, ‘Of course she could.’\n\n“I was there alone with my two sons at the time. It was ­terrifying. They gave me 24-hour security after that.”"
