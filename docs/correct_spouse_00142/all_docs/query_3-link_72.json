        "text": "Kid Rock, real name Robert Ritchie, got engaged to Audrey Berry in 2017.\n\nThey met in Detroit after Pamela Anderson’s divorce in 2007.\n\nBerry, not a celebrity, is a familiar face to Rock’s fans.\n\nKid Rock got engaged to his longtime girlfriend in 2007, Audrey Berry. Despite his history of high-profile relationships, including an on-again-off-again relationship with Pamela Anderson and links to Paris Hilton, Kid Rock has kept his relationship with Berry relatively private.\n\nKid Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, met Berry in suburban Detroit shortly after his divorce from Pamela Anderson was finalized in 2007. Their first date took place in Chicago, and they have been together ever since.\n\nBerry, though not a celebrity, became a familiar face to Kid Rock’s fans, often seen at his events, including his annual Chillin’ the Most cruise. The couple enjoys a shared love for hunting and the outdoors, and Kid Rock has credited Berry with influencing his song “Johnny Cash” from his album First Kiss.\n\nDespite their long relationship, Kid Rock rarely speaks publicly about Berry. In a 2011 interview, he acknowledged the challenges of dating someone outside of the celebrity world and expressed his efforts to be considerate of her.\n\nBerry first appeared with an engagement ring in April 2017 during a fan cruise. However, it was reported that they had been engaged earlier in the year, choosing to keep the news private. Their engagement has remained low-key, consistent with the couple’s preference for privacy in their relationship."
