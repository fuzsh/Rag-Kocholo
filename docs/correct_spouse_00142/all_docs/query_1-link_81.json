        "text": "Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee met on New Year's Eve of 1994, and they tied the knot just four days later.\n\nLast year's Hulu series Pam & Tommy followed the whirlwind relationship between the star and drummer in the 1990s, including their infamous sex tape scandal during their three-year marriage.\n\nThe show received backlash from Pamela, who was never asked permission to create it, nor was consulted in the making of it, per PEOPLE.\n\nNow, she's setting the record straight in Pamela, A Love Story, her new Netflix documentary, and her new memoir, , which both dropped on Jan. 31. The doc's trailer shows interviews with Pamela in addition to her two sons she had with Tommy: Brandon Thomas Lee, 26, and Dylan Jagger Lee, 25.\n\nCheck out the trailer here:\n\nThese two were never really in the spotlight growing up, considering how Pamela always prioritized their privacy. But now that they're working on their own projects, the boys are making a name for themselves.\n\nHere's everything to know about Brandon Thomas And Dylan Jagger Lee.\n\nBrandon works as an actor and reality TV star.\n\nBrandon Lee in 2021.\n\nHe acted in the films Sierra Burgess is a Loser (2017), (2020), and (2021), and the television show (2019), per IMDb. In 2019, Brandon also starred in the revival of and later returned for Season 2 of The Hills: New Beginnings, per ET Canada.\n\nHe previously told Interview in 2017 that he wanted to make a name for himself separate from his parents.\n\n\"I want to show people what I'm truly like,\" he said. \"There are a lot of misconceptions about the way we were raised—that we're spoiled, or that we were given everything. But our friends can back this up: Dylan and I haven't taken a dollar from our parents since we were in high school.\"\n\nBrandon also launched his own clothing fashion collaboration line.\n\nBack in November 2021, he dropped the retro Golf-inspired line called Swingers Club, with Local Authority.\n\n\"Golf is a huge part of my life and so is fashion,\" Brandon wrote on Instagram, via PEOPLE. \"Up until this point it's been a dream of mine to create a brand that reflects my sense of style combined with a lifestyle I love and enjoy. I can't wait to show you what's coming next!\"\n\nDylan is a musician.\n\nDylan Lee in 2018.\n\nDylan decided to follow in both his mother's and father's footsteps. He's a model and musician, but rather than rock music, he's actually big into EDM. He was one half of , which now only consists of his former group member, Kyle Girard.\n\nFollowing his unexpected exit in January 2021, he set off to create a new sound and joined a duo called , per PEOPLE. Seeing as their IG hasn't posted since March 2022, it's unclear whether the duo is still making music.\n\nHe's also done lots of modeling, beginning his career when he walked in the Saint Laurent 2016 show, per EWG Management, who also wrote that he's worked with Armani Exchange, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, Hugo Boss, Acne Studios, and more.\n\nThey didn't know their parents were famous while they were growing up.\n\nWhile chatting with Interview in 2017, Brandon revealed even though he did grow up in the spotlight, his parents did their best to give them a normal childhood. They were raised in Malibu, but actually went to boarding school on Vancouver Island, the outlet wrote.\n\n\"Life just happens at such an accelerated pace,\" Brandon told the outlet about growing up in L.A. \"Everything around you is happening faster. People are losing their virginity five years younger than everywhere else in America. People are getting involved in drugs at a much younger age.\"\n\nBrandon continued: \"I remember one day asking my mom, 'Hey, why does everybody take photos of us?' And she said, 'Oh, they do that to everybody.'\"\n\nAnd although they have crazy famous parents, they've worked for everything they have. \"We’ve been working our asses off to buy a house, buy a car, and pay for music equipment and acting lessons. It feels better to do it ourselves,\" Brandon told Interview.\n\nThey're still close to their parents.\n\nPamela Anderson and Tommy Lee at PETA’s 35th Anniversary Party\n\nDespite their parents being divorced, the family occasionally reunites to spend time together. Both of Pamela's sons have accompanied her to red carpet events.\n\nOne of their most recent get-togethers was in November of 2021, where Pamela and Tommy reunited to celebrate Swingers Club at The Webster Los Angeles.\n\nPamela's two sons showed up to her Broadway debut in April 2022 when she played Roxie Hart in Chicago, per PEOPLE. They were also by her side during the premiere of Pamela, A Love Story.\n\nPamela has said that their fam is a \"good team,\" during her 2023 PEOPLE cover story, due to her sons' different personalities. \"Dylan is more introspective and more Zen,\" she continued.\n\n\"Brandon and Dylan are true miracles, considering their gene pool,\" she wrote in her memoir, via PEOPLE. \"They have been through so much, yet they are not full of holes.\"\n\nHer sons have been supportive after her recent divorce.\n\nAfter Pamela made headlines when she announced from her husband of one year Dan Hayhurst in January 2022, she was spotted spending quality time with Dylan, who joined her for dinner at Nobu in Malibu less than two weeks later, per The Daily Mail.\n\nPamela's sons inspired her memoir and doc.\n\nPamela told PEOPLE that her sons \"encouraged me to tell my story.\"\n\nBrandon helped put together the documentary in January 2023, according to PEOPLE. He was even a producer on it, per IG. \"Brandon's the businessman,\" she told the outlet. \"He's this fiery kind of kid. He's just really creative.\"\n\nThey were also supportive of her memoir. \"My boys were excited for me to write my own book, but they both were like, 'Mom, you're going to need help to write this book,'\" she told PEOPLE. \"And I said, 'No, I can write this book myself.' They were shocked that I pulled this off.\"\n\nSo sweet!"
