I'm in love. I'm happy,\" Anderson writes on her website.\n\n\"It's been a whirlwind... spontaneous but well thought through.\"\n\nAnderson's spokeswoman declined to comment but US quoted an Anderson representative as saying, \"They have been close for a very long time and decided that now is the right time to take the next step.\"\n\nAnderson, 39, and Rock, 35, whose recordings include 1998's \"Devil Without a Cause,\" have been romantically linked since the early 2000s but broke off their relationship in 2003. Recently, they have been seen together vacationing along the Riviera.\n\nThe blond actress, who gained stardom in the 1990s on TV show \"Baywatch,\" was previously married to drummer Tommy Lee of rock band Motley Crue with whom she had two sons.\n\n- REUTERS"
