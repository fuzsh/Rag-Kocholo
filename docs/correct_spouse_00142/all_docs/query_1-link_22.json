        "text": "After three weddings in four months Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock have decided to call it a day. The former Baywatch star briefly confirmed the news on her website. \"Yes, it's true,\" she said, adding: \"Unfortunately impossible.\"\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster few years for the rock 'n' roll duo who became engaged in 2002 but broke up the following year. They dominated the headlines this summer when they had a series of nuptials beginning with a ceremony in late July on a yacht in Saint Tropez. The pair made it legal at a courthouse in Beverly Hills on August 3 and enjoyed yet another ceremony in Nashville on August 17.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Pam, who suffered a miscarriage while filming her new movie Blonde And Blonder earlier this month, filed divorce papers on Monday citing irreconcilable differences. \"It wasn't a happy Thanksgiving,\" revealed her publicist Tracy Nguyen.\n\nThere was some confusion over the date they separated, however. Kid also filed papers, under his real name Robert Ritchie, but named the separation date as Sunday November 26 while Pamela's papers state that they split before Thanksgiving weekend, on Tuesday November 21. Both asked that the court not get involved in awarding spousal support.\n\nHer short marriage to Kid was Pamela's second. The Canadian actress was previously married to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998 and has two sons with him - Brandon, ten, and Dylan, eight. Her 35-year-old estranged husband also has a child, Robert Jr, from a relationship with former girlfriend Kelley South Russell."
