        "text": "HOLLYWOOD model and actress Pamela Anderson has been married a number of times.\n\nShe has two children as a result of her five marriages over the span of 26 years.\n\nWho are Pamela Anderson's ex-husbands?\n\nPamela Anderson has been married six times.\n\nDan Hayhurst\n\nMost recently, Pamela married her bodyguard after falling in love during the Covid lockdown.\n\nOn January 20, 2022, a year after the pair wed, it was announced that Pamela had filed for divorce from Dan.\n\n\"I'm exactly where I need to be - in the arms of a man who truly loves me,\" Anderson told the Daily Mail at the time.\n\nTommy Lee\n\nPamela's first marriage was to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee in 1995.\n\nThe pair got hitched just four days after meeting, and shortly after their whirlwind wedding, their sex tape sensationally leaked online.\n\nAnderson and Lee were married for three years and had two sons together, Brandon and Dylan.\n\nThey split after Lee assaulted Anderson while Dylan was still young. After Lee served six months in jail, he and Anderson reunited, at some point, but ultimately split again in 2001.\n\nThey reconciled once more in 2008 and even lived together, but their reunion was short-lived.\n\nKid Rock\n\nAnderson was once married to musician Kid Rock from 2006 to 2007.\n\nThey got together in 2001, became engaged in 2002, and broke up in 2003. Three years later, they announced their engagement to the world.\n\nAnderson suffered a miscarriage while the pair were married and the two divorced shortly after, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nRick Salomon\n\nIn 2007, Anderson revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she was engaged to Rick Salomon.\n\nThat year, the two wed at The Mirage in Las Vegas, but they divorced just ten weeks later citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nIn February 2008, the marriage was officially annulled on the basis of fraud.\n\nOn the Ellen show again in 2014, she told the host that she and Salomon were friends with benefits. Saloman and Anderson remarried again that year, but they divorced in 2015.\n\nJon Peters\n\nAnderson first dated Jon Peters over thirty years ago.\n\n\"There are beautiful girls everywhere,\" Peters, a film producer, told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"I could have my pick, but for 35 years I've only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild -- in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated.\"\n\nThe two wed in a secret ceremony in January 2020. Anderson wrote a poem about Lee and provided it to the outlet. It read:\n\n“Jon is the original ‘bad boy’ of Hollywood/ no one compares/ I love him deeply like family. His life used to scare me. So much for a girl like me. Now I’ve seen more of life and realize. He’s been there all along. Never failed me/ I’m ready now and he's ready too/ We understand and respect each other/ We love each other without conditions/ I’m a lucky woman/ Proof God has a plan.”\n\nThey divorced just twelve days after they married."
