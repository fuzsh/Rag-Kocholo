        "text": "They were divorced back in 1998 and she’s been ­married five times since, but Pamela Anderson says she’s never got over her divorce from Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee.\n\nThe relationship was responsible for her two sons, one of the first global celebrity sex tapes and even a Disney+ drama series.\n\nIn a new documentary, the former Baywatch actress lies in the bath and records a voice memo.\n\nShe says: “I think what it all comes down to is that I never got over not being able to make it work with the father of my kids.\n\n\"And even though I thought I could recreate a family or fall in love with somebody else, it’s just not me.\n\n“It’s impossible to be with anybody else. But I don’t think I could be with Tommy either.”\n\nIn the documentary for Netflix, Anderson also gives access to her home videos and personal diaries to chart her extraordinary life.\n\nShe claims she was raped aged 12. And she says she was molested by her babysitter, who she claims she tried to kill aged eight.\n\nHer life changed overnight when she was spotted at a BC Lions Canadian Football League game wearing a Labatt’s Beer T-shirt in 1989.\n\nThe company hired her and she became a model.\n\nShe was invited to the Playboy mansion and moved to LA.\n\nTV casting bosses for Baywatch came calling in 1991 and her role as CJ Parker from 1992 to 1997 made her a global star.\n\nBut she was at her happiest during the early years of her love with Tommy Lee.\n\nThey met on New Year’s Eve 1994 at a party. The drummer licked her face just minutes after meeting her, which made her laugh.\n\nHe got her number but just when they were due to meet up she had to fly to Cancun, Mexico, for a photoshoot.\n\nObsessed Tommy flew to Mexico too and continued to call her.\n\nShe explains: “Finally I went ‘what could possibly go wrong… let’s call him’.”\n\nPam says she met Tommy at a ­nightspot, where she tried the drug ecstasy for the first time.\n\nShe says: “The pupils in my eyes… I thought I looked so cool. The rest is all a big blur. A big happy blur.\n\n“Later on that night, he said ‘do you wanna get married?’ I was like, ‘Yeah’. He took his friend’s skull ring off and put it on my finger.”\n\nThey married on a beach just four days after meeting.\n\nThroughout the early stages of their relationship they would film themselves on camcorders.\n\nWhen a safe was stolen from their home it contained a number of tapes, including ­intimate moments together.\n\nAt first the film was leaked on VHS but then spread much faster online. Pamela says the release of the tapes caused untold misery and that she and Tommy were never compensated financially.\n\nIn June 1996, the pair welcomed their first son Brandon and another son, Dylan, the following year.\n\nBut by 1998 their ­relationship was starting to fall apart. Tommy had never liked his wife kissing other men in Baywatch.\n\nBut now he was also struggling to cope with not being her number one man as she cared for their two sons.\n\nAccording to Pamela’s upcoming memoir, her husband “ripped” their oldest boy away from her and battered her as she held her seven-month-old son.\n\nIn the documentary she says: “It was a terrible night when Tommy was rocking on the floor and Brandon was crying in the playpen. I was holding Dylan. Tommy was going ‘I want my wife back’. I called 911.”\n\nTommy Lee pleaded no contest to felony spousal battery and was sentenced to six months. Anderson filed for divorce.\n\nShe says: “I still couldn’t believe that the person I loved the most was capable of what had happened that night.” The documentary also shows her reaction to Disney+ drama Pam & Tommy, about the sex tapes.\n\nShe explains: “It really gives me nightmares. I have no desire to watch it.”\n\nAlthough Anderson says she never fell in love again, she remarried many times.\n\nShe married and divorced Kid Rock in 2006.\n\nShe wed producer Rick Solomon in 2007 for a year, and again for a year in 2014. She also married producer Jon Peters in 2020, before announcing their separation 12 days later.\n\nShe was most recently married to her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst. She filed for divorce after a year. But Pam ends the documentary by saying she has no regrets.\n\nShe says: “As much pain as we can endure in our lives is kind of like the catalyst to all the great stuff like poetry, music, art. I’m grateful for all the experiences I had and I don’t blame anybody for anything.\n\n“I’m glad it happened.”\n\nPamela, A Love Story is released on Netflix on January 31."
