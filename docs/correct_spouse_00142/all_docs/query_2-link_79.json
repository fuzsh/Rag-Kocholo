        "text": "Where It All Began\n\nIn 1967, Pamela Denise Anderson was born into a very humble family in Ladysmith, British Columbia. Her father, Barry, repaired furnaces.\n\nBarry's grandfather, Juho was a Finnish immigrant who came to Canada in 1908 and changed his last name from Hyytiäinen to Anderson in other to assimilate. Pamela's mother, Carol, was a waiter who had a bit of Russian descent. Her younger brother was born in 1971.\n\nA Special Baby\n\nAnderson was born on the 1st of July. She was lucky enough that her birthday fell on the date and year that Canada would celebrate the 100th Anniversary of its official founding. Since she was born in the early hours of the day, she was declared Canada’s first “Centennial Baby.”\n\nShe even had some newspapers reporting about her that day, so it's safe to say she was born to be famous.\n\nIn the Right Zone at the Right Time\n\nToday many start their careers before they even hit puberty, but Pamela only got her big break at the age of 21. By 1988, Anderson found a job as a fitness instructor in Vancouver and met her would-be boyfriend, photographer Dan Ilicic.\n\nVisiting a Columbia Lions Football game at the Vancouver Stadium, Pam's life was about to change. There she wore a Labatt Beer t-shirt and caught the attention of the stadium camera, an image that resulted in wild cheers from the crowds.\n\nThe Boyfriend That Changed It All\n\nBoyfriend Dan saw a terrific opportunity in Pamela. There's a reason why many photographers and models date, it's a relationship that benefits both sides.\n\nDan made a poster of Pamela wearing her Labatt Beer t-shirt that said “Enter the Blue Zone. Labatt’s”, producing the Blue Zone Girl – an ad campaign that will change her life. The Labatt Beer Company signed Anderson as their spokesperson. That was just the start.\n\nWhen Pam Met Jon\n\nThere isn't a lot that is known about Dan and Pam's relationship. But we do know it came to an end as her career was beginning. While scoring a string of modeling gigs in the late 80s, Anderson met hot-shot movie producer Jon Peters at the Playboy Mansion.\n\nPeters must have made quite the impression on the young model because, despite their 22-year gap, the two moved in together shortly after meeting.\n\nA Failed Proposal?\n\nUnconfirmed rumors claim that Jon Peters proposed to Pamela in the late 80s but she turned him down. We are not sure why she did so, but we do know she was very young, her life was just beginning, and she took the world by storm, so marriage was not on the cards.\n\nStill, the two split up after this unfortunate affair. But that wasn't the end of their bizarre love story. They crossed paths down the line, but more on that later.\n\nVince Neil\n\nMötley Crüe's drummer, Tommy Lee Bass, famously married Pamela in 1995. Interestingly enough, Anderson was linked to another member of the band years beforehand. Vince Neil Wharton is famously known as being the lead singer of the band Mötley Crüe. The two dated for a couple of months back in 1993.\n\nShe even appeared on his first solo album, Exposed, in the music video “Can’t Have Your Cake.”\n\nMore Than a Cover Girl\n\nThe burgeoning star landed her first acting position in the TV series \"Home Improvement.\"\n\nAnderson’s role was the first “Tool Time girl” called Lisa. Her character would sport Tim and Al and help them with tools. She stayed for two seasons before she decided to move on to bigger and better things. Still, she made another appearance in the 6th season of the show where it turned out her character has become a paramedic!\n\nWatching Baywatch\n\nAnderson got the role of lifeguard C.J. Parker in \"Baywatch\" and captivated the entire world with her iconic red swimsuit for five seasons. She ended up leaving the show in 1997. It was known to be the most-watched series internationally at the time.\n\nUp until today, the show and C.J. hold a special place in American Culture. After leaving, she continued to model for \"Outdoor Life\" and got cozy with her new beau Scott Baio.\n\nAnother Marriage Proposal!\n\nWell-known actor and ladies' man Scott Baio gained popularity for his role as Chachi Arcola on the sitcom series \"Happy Days.\" His other claim to fame is that he was the second guy to propose to Anderson after a rather brief encounter.\n\nShe seems to have this amazing power to get people to want to marry her. We wonder, what's her secret? She should tell it to all of us!\n\nBaio Was Two-Timing\n\nBaio ended up betraying Pamela in the worst way possible. During an interview with Howard Stern, he said his weakness was women and he was rarely faithful to them, so, when news came out that he did the same with Anderson, it wasn’t the biggest surprise.\n\nBaio also claimed during an interview that he sent the photos of Anderson to the casting agency for \"Baywatch\" so he feels like he should be credited and recognized for getting her the part.\n\nAnother Man Who Wanted to Marry Her\n\nEric Nies was one of the original cast members of MTV’s reality series \"The Real World: New York\" and \"The Grind.\" When he met Pamela he fell for her and the two spent a few romantic months together.\n\nLike many men before and after him, he wanted to marry her. Niles said she's marriage material because “Not only is she beautiful, but her heart is in the right place. She's totally down to earth”.\n\nPam and David Charvet\n\nAs luck would have it, Pamela met her next beau on the set of \"Baywatch.\" It makes sense, many actors end up meeting a partner on set. Costar David Charvet was a handsome French TV personality and a singer too.\n\nThis charming couple dated for two years, which counts as a serious relationship in our books. They ended up breaking up because working together and living together has put a strain on their partnership.\n\nPamela and Dean Cain\n\nAmerican actor and producer Dean Cain scored the major role of Superman in the \"Louis & Clark\" series in 1993. If you don't remember his beautiful face from that show, you must know him as the host of \"Ripley’s Believe it or Not!\" He worked on that show from 2000-to 2003.\n\nBut, believe it or not, before \"Ripley’s Believe it or Not\" the Superman actor dated Anderson. All we know is that they had a relationship somewhere in the early 90s, the rest is a mystery.\n\nPamela and Arsenio Hall\n\nLike with many of Anderson’s past relationships, we're a bit hazy with the details, but that's exactly what keeps up wanting to learn more about her! Arsenio Hall is an American actor and comedian who has also had a small fling with Pam.\n\nEven though there is not a lot of info on their relationship, they both acknowledge that there was something between them in the mid-90s. God, we wish they would just tell us a little bit more!\n\nFrom \"Raw Justice\" to Rock & Roll Stars\n\nAfter a few busy years filming \"Baywatch\" and dating a fair share of interesting people, Anderson still found the time to make her debut on the big screen with her role as Sarah in \"Raw Justice\" (2004).\n\nHer life was about to get a whole lot more interesting, and she discovered that some of her greatest loves were all wild rockstars.\n\nBret Michaels\n\nBret Michael Sychak, the greatly successful American singer-songwriter for the band Poison, was Anderson’s first big romance. Anderson’s mother, Carol, did not approve of him because of his rocker lifestyle.\n\nWe bet her mom being against the relationship just made Bret more appealing to Pamela. There is just something about bad boys that makes them so hard to resist! The couple embarked on a scandalous relationship that gained them a lot of media attention.\n\nThe Tape\n\nPassions ran high, and surprisingly — or maybe unsurprisingly, depends on who you'd ask — a tape of the two of them together was mysteriously leaked to the public. Can you imagine the \"I told you so\" Pamela got from her mother? Things got out of control, and the relationship ended.\n\nBut it wasn’t the Rock & Roll lifestyle or the tape that caused the breakup. As Anderson said, Michaels “liked the buffet,” and Anderson has always been monogamously inclined.\n\nEloping With Tommy Lee\n\nThe Mötley Crüe drummer and founder met Anderson just two months after he got divorced from his second wife Heather Locklear. That fact did not stop him from embarking on a new serious relationship right away. Pam and Tommy met at New Year’s Eve party in 1994 in Beverley Hills. They eloped after only knowing each other for four days. In 1995 the two got married in a lovely resort in Cancun, Mexico.\n\nA Rushed Wedding\n\nWhen you get married less than a week after meeting someone, there's really no time to plan the perfect wedding, you just gotta make do with what you have. This might explain why Anderson wore a white bikini at the ceremony.\n\nShe opted to get Lee's first name, \"Tommy\" inked on her finger. The couple stunned the public upon their return to Hollywood, including her mother, who only found out about the wedding in the tabloids.\n\nThee Years, Two Children, One Tape\n\nPam and Tommy's marriage lasted three years, which is impressive considering their decision to tie the knot was so rushed. The two had two children together. Being rather excited, these newlyweds had made an intimate tape on their Honeymoon, which was unfortunately stolen from their safe by their former electrician, Rand Gauthier, in 1996.\n\nThe couple filed a $10 million lawsuit, which you'd expected would resolve the whole issue, but that's the opposite of what ended up happing.\n\nCopyright? Copy-Wrong\n\nIn a peculiar move, the couple decided to sign the rights of their private tape away. They gave the rights to Seth Warshavasky, an American-Polish internet pioneer. They thought that his plan was to broadcast the video once, on his website.\n\nTurns out he had something else in mind. Now, the video that was obtained against their will, was being sold to the masses by Warshavasky. He didn't really care about the couple's feelings or privacy.\n\nA Clean Slate & The Rocky Road Ahead\n\nBy 1998, Anderson had filed for a divorce after a few heated altercations that occurred between her and Lee. Anderson actually ended up taking her rocker husband to court in an attempt to get him behind bars. It worked.\n\nHe never contested and spent the six months in the Los Angeles County Jail. He also had to engage in 200 hours of community service.\n\nMaking Amends\n\nLee took further responsibility and donated $6,200 to a women’s shelter that dealt with similar issues. After leaving \"Baywatch\" and just going through a divorce, Anderson got the role for a drama series \"V.I.P.\" as Vallery Irons. She portrayed a Hollywood figurehead for a private bodyguard company called \"Vallery Irons Protection.\"\n\nThe series went on to record 4 seasons until 2002. It may not have reached the heights of \"Baywatch,\" but still, countless loyal Pamela fans tuned in to watch the show.\n\nBarb Wire\n\nRegardless of their whirlpool marriage, Anderson continued to focus on her career and starred in the superhero film based on the \"Dark Horse\" comic series \"Barb Wire.\"\n\nDuring filming, Anderson had to get a barbwire tattoo drawn on her arm as part of her character. Being frustrated with it being drawn on so many times, she decided to get it permanently done. Eventually regretting her decision, she went to get the tattoo removed in 2016.\n\nMeeting Kelly Slater\n\nBack in 1992, \"Baywatch\" called upon surfing legend Kelly Slater. The model and environmental activist is widely known for his record-holding 11 World Championships for Surfing.\n\nHe was also crowned the youngest, and eventually oldest, surfer to win the Championships. In the show, he played a talented surfer, named Jimmy Slade. When you get two young beautiful people to be working together for long hours, there's really only one possible outcome.\n\nKeeping Up With Kelly\n\nSlater went on to star in 27 episodes of the show and left in 1996 for the North shore of Hawaii to pursue his professional surfing career. Slater and Anderson started dating in 1998 for a wholesome 20 months.\n\nAs for his relationship with Anderson, he said, “I learned a lot. I don’t have any ill feelings toward her. I wish her well. Hey, we had an amazing time together.”\n\nPamela and Marcus Schenkenberg\n\nSoon after, Anderson met Calvin Klein model Marcus Schenkenberg in Monaco. His modeling and acting career aside, Schenkenberg also made magazine covers from his 10-month relationship with the actress. This attractive couple had kept their privacy and rarely made appearances in public, apart from the Iceberg ad they did together.\n\nThey broke up in 2001 because of their busy schedules, he wanted to focus on his career, and she wanted to focus on her kids.\n\nMichael Bolton\n\nShortly after breaking up with Schenkenberg, Anderson was invited to Michael Jordan’s Celebrity Golf Invitational Opening Party in Paradise Island, Bahamas. There she met and challenged American songwriter and ballad singer to a tequila drinking contest.\n\nShe went on to win the contest against Bolton. He helped her get over the breakup with Schenkenberg. That being said, it was a short-lived romance.\n\nKid Rock\n\nIn the same year, Anderson started seeing entertaining American singer, rapper, and record producer Robert James Ritchie, better known as Kid Rock. They met the previous year at the VH1 Aretha Franklin Tribute Show. Kid Rock became the third guy to propose to Anderson.\n\nIn the year 2002, he popped the question; he thought it was appropriate to call up her ex-husband Tommy Lee to tell him the news before he the tabloid does; Lee was furious. They called off their engagement within the year.\n\nFred Durst\n\nAnderson had a small fling with American lead singer and lyricist of Limp Bizkit quite soon after splitting with Kid Rock in 2003. William Frederick Durst had a successful career with the nu-metal band, Limp Bizkit.\n\nThese two were seen out for a few dates but ended up going their own way. The rocker has since moved on to direct independent films.\n\nStephen Dorff\n\nTaking a break from the Rock & Roll scene, Anderson got close with her long-term friend and fellow American actor Stephen Dorff (Stephen Hartley Dorff Jr.) for five months. Stephen, born on July 29th in 1973, is known for his role as Roland West in HBO’s \"True Detective.\"\n\nTheir relationship didn’t end in flames; they just naturally parted – and reconciled in 2008 for one crazy night in Miami.\n\nThe End of V.I.P.\n\nAnderson's series \"V.I.P.\" was canceled. What did she do? Reprise her role in \"Baywatch,\" of course. The film reunion \"Baywatch: Hawaiian Wedding\" was released in 2003.\n\nWhile on Baywatch, Anderson was still modeling for \"Outdoor Life,\" appearing on the magazine cover each year. In early 2003, Stan Lee asked Anderson to star in his American adult superhero animated series, \"Striperella\" in the leading role as secret agent Erotica Jones. The short-lived show was terminated in 2004.\n\nMark McGrath\n\nIn November 2005, Anderson went back into the music scene and had a small thing with the lead vocalist of Sugar Ray, Mark Sayers McGrath. They had a fun relationship, with him teasing her at the Teen Choice Awards back in 2002 when he used two beach balls as a prop to imitate Anderson.\n\nThe Ethan Hawke lookalike spent a weekend with Anderson at her Malibu home, seldom leaving to pick up groceries.\n\nRay J\n\nIn March 2006, Anderson caught Ray J’s attention on a wild night out at Kaberet’s Prophecy in London by spending a couple of thousands of dollars on champagne to win him over. William Ray Norwood Jr. was born in 1981 and is an American rapper, TV personality, and entrepreneur.\n\nHe’s also Snoop Dogg’s cousin. Their fling didn’t last long, but they do share a bit in common as Ray J was the guy in Kim Kardashian’s scandalous tape.\n\nEddie Irvine\n\nAnderson wanted to meet Irish race car driver Eddie Irvine. Thanks to mutual friends they met up and instantly hit it off. Edmund Irvine Jr. is a former Professional Formula One Driver, and according to Anderson, he was too much of a gentleman.\n\nBeing the nice guy didn’t pay off for Irvine and the love birds ended the fling after a few months.\n\nKid Rock, Again\n\nAfter their rocky first break up, they couldn’t resist each other once more and had tied the knot on a yacht in St. Tropez, France. They got officially married on August 6th, 2006.\n\nIf you thought they learned from their mistakes and their second time would be a charm — you're wrong. Anderson filed for divorce 17 days later, stating the relationship was “unfortunately impossible.” Many rumors led up to their swift divorce.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen Ruined Their Marriage\n\nWhat's \"Borat\" got to do with Kid Rock and Anderson's divorce? Apparently everything. At the screening of the film, Rock was not impressed with a specific scene Anderson was a part of.\n\nShortly after, Sacha Baron Cohen had asked Anderson what Rock thought, and she responded, “He’s getting divorced.” At first, Cohen thought it was a joke. It ended up being the strange and sad truth, and the couple officially parted ways on February 1st, 2007. They never spoke again.\n\nLaurence Hallier\n\nAfter coming out of her marriage with Rock, Anderson found herself in a roller-coaster relationship with Show Media Inc. founder and property developer, Laurence Hallier.\n\nAnderson promoted the Halliers Panorama Towers in Las Vegas in exchange for a condo, but the deal never went through and she sued him for $1 million. His defense was that she did not deliver on her promise and they eventually settled an undisclosed amount.\n\nHans Klok\n\n2007 was an interesting year for Anderson’s career. She was invited to work with famous Dutch magician Johannes Franciscus Catharines Klok, better known as Hans Klok. His show was such a success in Europe he decided to bring it to the United States.\n\nHe had asked Anderson to help on his show called \"The Beauty of Magic\" in Planet Hollywood Resort, for nine months.\n\nBig Shot Rumors\n\nAnderson has had many relationships. It doesn’t matter to her if you are a famous rocker, a local surfer, or a bodyguard - anything goes. Anderson also admitted in an interview with Piers Morgan that she had a bit of a crush on Michael Jackson.\n\nShe revealed they would secretly meet up for lunch occasionally in Malibu at The Shutters Hotel, but she explained that nothing ever happened.\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nBeing in Hollywood, people are going to talk. There were whispers of how Sylvester Stallone offered Anderson a Porsche and a condo to be his number one girl back in 1989. Yes, we are not making this up, he tried to bribe her into dating him!\n\nHer response was, “does that mean there is a number two?” and responded candidly that “of course.” Wow. We can't blame her for turning down his offer.\n\nJulian Assange\n\nOne of the greatest speculations about Pamela's love life is that she had a relationship with Julian Assange back in 2015. If the name rings a bell, that's because it should. He was the guy who founded WikiLeaks in 2006. By 2010, it gained attention all over the globe.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan Pamela was asked what was happening between the two. Her response seemed to have confirmed the duo's involvement.\n\nA Relationship in Hiding\n\nAssange was in hiding at the Embassy of Ecuador in London from 2012. Anderson said that it was difficult to have a relationship. She told \"People Magazine\" that what he has done is “trying to free the world by educating it” and that it is “a great service.\"\n\nIn April 2019, Assange was arrested, and Anderson responded with a furious tweet on Twitter. She also wrote a letter to Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison, asking him to make greater efforts for Julian.\n\n\"Just Buddies\" With Usher\n\nRumors rumors, all around. In 2006, there were rumors of Usher and Anderson having a short-lived fling.\n\nEven though she did deny it – a year later, it appeared that they had a convincing relationship. Not long after, Usher proposed to his now ex-wife Tameka Foster.\n\nPamela and David Spade\n\nDavid Spade and Anderson were often in the same social circles; which led to rumors. They had been seen together in the Mirage Resort in Las Vegas. Soon, the two were caught on a romantic stroll all the way to the club.\n\nFortunately for us, but unfortunately for them, the paparazzi snapped Anderson giving old Spade a little peck on the cheek. Naturally, the rumors ran rampant. It was Vegas, after all.\n\nPamela and David Binn\n\nIn April of 2007, Anderson fell for “real man,” former American pro football player for the San Diego Chargers, who had played 18 seasons for the National Football League. At the same time the fling began, there were hints that Tommy Lee was back in the picture. He had offered to buy Anderson an island in Dubai so that the family of four could spend time together.\n\nAnderson tamed those conspiracies by getting on a plane with Binn and going on a small getaway trip.\n\nPamela and Rick Salomon\n\nAnderson had been friends with American poker player Rock Salomon for 17 years before they decided to tie the knot. Born on January 24th, 1968, Rick Salomon is well-known for playing high-balling poker.\n\nHe's also known for having a scandalous tape of his own with Paris Hilton back in 2004. It makes sense that the two found common ground, as they both had this unique troubling experience to share.\n\nYet Another Failed Marriage\n\nThey have a cute story of how they met. Anderson was on the losing side of a game of poker, and Salomon offered to clean the slate in exchange for a kiss. They got hitched in September 2007 during a show break on \"The Beauty of Magic.\"\n\nLess than 10 weeks later, on December 14th, Anderson filed for divorce due to the couple's “irreconcilable differences.” The marriage was declared annulled on the 24th of March, 2008.\n\nPamela and Criss Angel\n\nIn December 2008, Anderson and illusionist and Cirque du Soleil magician Christopher Nicholas Sarantakos, better known as Criss Angel, were spotted partying together.\n\nThey shared a kiss at Anderson’s 41st birthday party in July 2008, but it never went anywhere and the two parted ways.\n\nPamela and Matt Evers\n\nIn 2013, Anderson participated in Britain’s \"Dancing on Ice\" with the previous winner — American model and professional ice-skater Matt Evers, but unfortunately, due to a closet malfunction, the couple were the first to be disqualified.\n\nShortly after, Evers made plans to visit Anderson in Malibu after Christmas and was her guest of honor at the New Year’s Eve party, which she hosted in London.\n\nYes, Tommy Lee, Again\n\nDespite the fact that Tommy Lee and Anderson called it quits, they still have two children together and will always be in each other's lives. At the 2007 Video Music Awards (VMA), Tommy Lee and Kid Rock had a small altercation after Lee called him ‘Kid Pebbles.’\n\nAccording to Anderson, they really tried to make it work out in 2008; “We’ve only given it a try 800 times – 801, here we go”. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out, and they went separate ways.\n\nPamela and Adil Rami\n\nAnderson changed up the pace when she started seeing French professional soccer player Adil Rami for nearly two years. Born December 27th, 1985, the young soccer player boasted that the two of them were very intimate after Anderson moved in with him in Marseille.\n\nIn 2019, Anderson ended things by declaring that he was “living a double life.” He denied it but never got her back.\n\nJon Peters\n\nAnderson has a habit of rekindling old flames. From Kid Rock to Rick Salomon, her reunion with Jon Peters takes the cake. The two had a lot of love for each other over the decades and finally decided to wed in Malibu.\n\nBut before the wedding license was formalized, they decided to go separate ways. Like some of her other marriages, this one only lasted two weeks before. Sources say that Anderson's trip to India for an \"Ayurvedic cleanse\" may have influenced her decision.\n\nPam and Tommy, the Limited Series\n\nThe relationship of these two has been one of the most interesting to follow, so much so that in 2020 Rob Siegl wrote a script for a series about them.\n\nLily James and Sebastian Stan have agreed to play as young Pamela and Tommy. Seth Rogan is the couple’s electrician that stole their tape. As entertaining as the scandal of the tape was, it is not the direct focus of the series, it's more about their relationship over the years.\n\nThe Two Sons\n\nIt was no surprise that with parents like Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, their children would have interesting lives ahead. To keep her kids out of the flashing mobs of Hollywood, Anderson and Lee sent the Lee brothers to a boarding school on Vancouver Island.\n\nOnce they returned to Malibu, it seemed that the brothers had followed the career steps of their parents.\n\nDylan Jagger Lee\n\nWith a rocker dad, it is no surprise that his middle name is Jagger and that he has gotten into the music industry, as well as the modeling industry. He's been quite successful in both.\n\nAt first, he was very reluctant to even listen to music but soon enough, he gave in and fall in love with the experience. His band, Midnight Kids, released their second album, The Lost Youth, in 2020.\n\nBrandon Thomas Lee\n\nThe first-born Brandon found modeling early as he has done a few features for Dolce & Gabbana. He also is in the reboot of \"The Hills\" called \"The Hills: New Beginnings. \" Brandon has expressed that he's made major efforts to make his own way and wanted to set the record straight about him and his brother Dylan's public image.\n\nHe said that they weren’t given everything as children, and they worked for every cent they’ve received after high school. He wanted to emphasize that he is a professional, not just the son of.\n\nCalling the Cops\n\nOn one particular night, the family fights got a little out of control, and Tomm Lee's then-fiancée, Brittany Furlan, had to call the cops to come to break it up. It wasn't clear if it was Brandon or Tommy who started it, but whatever the case, the authorities broke it up as soon as they could.\n\nTommy posted a picture of his injured face on Instagram with a caption saying, “My heart is broken.\" Needless to say, things aren't perfect at the with the Anderson Lees.\n\nCleaning Up\n\nBrandon has made a real effort to try and clean up his act and is rightly very proud of doing it. Still, he had a hard time when he lived in Hollywood in 2016.\n\nIt's been said that he was out every night, and eventually, he did the opposite and stopped leaving his apartment altogether. Once he got his life together – he began landing modeling jobs, just like his beloved mother.\n\nThe Darkest Place\n\nIn an interview, Brandon Thomas Lee revealed exactly what happened to him, saying \"I was in one of the darkest spots of my entire life, I didn’t want to leave my apartment. I couldn’t do anything. Ever since I got sober, I just feel like everything’s gotten better for me.”\n\nThe words he shared were brave and we're sure he encouraged many to try and get over whatever it is that's holding them back.\n\nThe Relationship Between Father and Son\n\nWith the domestic feuds in their past, it comes as no surprise to hear that Brandon and his father got into a public fight in 2018, at Tommy Lee’s Calabasas home.\n\nLater that year, Brandon had planned an intervention for his father because he found his father's issues getting worse and worse. Sadly, his efforts failed. Brandon said, \"I’ve worked tirelessly organizing an intervention, and it’s incredibly upsetting that it never came to fruition.”\n\nDan Hayhurst\n\nFamily feuds aside, Anderson has never stopped fighting for love. Ultimately, it looks like she found it. On Christmas Eve in December 2020, she made the call to marry her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst in her hometown Ladysmith, Canada.\n\nHayhurst has been involved in the RASTA animal sanctuary in Chemainus, Canada, and the newlyweds spent their time providing sanctuary to animals in need.\n\nYet Another Divorce, Alone Again\n\nIn January 2022 it was announced that Anderson's fourth marriage ended just like all the previous ones, in divorce. According to sources close to her, they grew apart.\n\nThey both spent a lot of time at home, and they got to know each other better, maybe too much. It turns out she learned he just wasn't the person she thought he was."
