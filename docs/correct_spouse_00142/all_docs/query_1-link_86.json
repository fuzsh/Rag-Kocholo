        "text": "After 12 days of marriage, Pamela Anderson and film producer Jon Peters have called it quits.\n\n\"I have been moved by the warm reception to Jon and my union,\" Anderson said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. \"We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to re-evaluate what we want from life and from one another. Life is a journey and love is a process. With that universal truth in mind, we have mutually decided to put off the formalization of our marriage certificate and put our faith in the process. Thank you for respecting our privacy.\"\n\nAnderson and Peters, who produced both the 1976 and 2018 remakes of \"A Star Is Born,\" married in a secret ceremony on January 20. The pair first dated 35 years ago after they met at the Playboy Mansion just as Anderson had moved to Los Angeles. They reconnected in recent months, keeping their relationship a secret.\n\nAfter their nuptials, Peters said, “Pamela has never seen her full potential as an artist.”\n\n“She has yet to shine in a real way,” he added. “There is much more to her than meets the eye, or I wouldn’t love her so much. There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but—for 35 years—I’ve only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild—in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated.”\n\nThe former \"Baywatch\" star shared her own statement after their marriage in the form of a poem about Peters, writing:\n\n\"Jon is the original ‘bad boy’ of Hollywood -\n\nno one compares -\n\nI love him deeply like family.\n\nHis life used to scare me.\n\nSo much for a girl like me.\n\nNow I’ve seen more of life\n\nand realize ..\n\nHe’s been there all along.\n\nNever failed me -\n\nI’m ready now\n\nand\n\nhe’s ready too -\n\nWe\n\nunderstand\n\nand respect each other -\n\nWe love each other\n\nwithout conditions. -\n\nI’m a lucky woman. -\n\nProof\n\nGod has a plan”\n\nThis is the fifth marriage for both of them. Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and Rock Salomon (who she married twice) are Anderson’s exes. Peters was previously married to Henrietta Zampitella, Lesley Ann Warren (who he famously cheated on with Barbra Streisand), Christine Forsyth-Peters and Mindy Peters.\n\nPeters has not commented yet on his separation from Anderson."
