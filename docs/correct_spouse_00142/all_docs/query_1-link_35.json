However, we know his dadâs hometown is Romeo, Michigan. Clearly, Ritchie Jr. is an American citizen by birth and his date of birth means he belongs to the Gemini zodiac identity.\n\nWith respect to Robert James Ritchie Jr.âs ethnicity, his dad is White American with a blend of German, Scottish, English, Dutch, and Irish roots, while his mother has African-American heritage. Talking about his mother, her name is Kelley South Russell but she wasnât involved in his upbringing.\n\nRobert James Ritchie Jr.âs Parents Were Never Married\n\nRobert Ritchie Jr.âs dad and mom were together for awhile, but they were not officially married. They met in eighth grade and started off as classmates before becoming lovers. Their relationship lasted for almost a decade and they raised three children together, including Robert Ritchie Jr., however, Kid Rock never asked Kelly to marry him.\n\nWhen Robert Ritchie was seven years old, his parents went their separate ways. This happened because Kid Rock found that he was not the father of one of Kellyâs children.\n\nHe Was Raised By A Single Dad\n\nWhile growing up, Robert James Ritchie Jr. never experienced what it means to have a complete family. After his parents split, what followed was a heated custody battle over who would keep him, Luckily for his father, he won and was granted full custody him. His mother, Kelley Russell, was then required to pay child support of $25 to Kid Rock every week.\n\nAs a result of the separation of his parents and the full custody granted to his father, Robert Ritchie Jr. was single-handedly raised by his dad. His fatherâs career did not give them the opportunity to spend so much time together, but thankfully, he wasnât affected by it so much. While his dad was about his business and frolicking with his other female partners, Robert Ritchie Jr. spent his time studying.\n\nUnlike some celebrity kids who couldnât complete their educational pursuits, Kid Rockâs son is a graduate. He graduated from Belmont University, Nashville, and his dad is so proud of him for completing college.\n\nWho Is Robert Ritchie Jr.âs Mother?\n\nRobert James Ritchie Jr.âs mom is Kelley South Russell. She is an African-American lady who is said to be an autoworker with the American automobile giant, Ford Motor Company.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, she met Kid Rock in Michigan as a young girl in 1985 while they were both in eighth grade. They fell in love and were together for quite a long time. However, they separated about seven years after Robert James Ritchie Jr. was born.\n\nUnfortunately, Robert Ritchie Jr.âs mom was addicted to substance abuse and alcohol. There are reports that she acted violently to her family members from time to time. This may be one of the reasons why she could not win her baby father, Kid Rock, for the custody of Robert.\n\nMeet Robert Ritchie Jr.âs Dad, Kid Rock\n\nKid Rock is an American singer and composer. Born on January 17,1971, Kid Rock is a native of Romeo Michigan. He started his career as a rapper and DJ way back in 1990 with his debut album titled Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast. Subsequently, he released other albums and singles like Devil Without a Cause, Cocky, Rock N Roll Jesus, Rebel Soul and Sweet Southern Sugar.\n\nKid Rock had his way around women, but was married only once. First, he was in an uncommitted relationship with his eighth grade sweetheart, Kelley South Russell. They nurtured three kids, but only two, including Robert Ritchie Jr., were reportedly his biological children. However, they finally parted ways a few years after Robert Ritchie Jr.âs birth.\n\nLater in 2000, Kid rock allegedly got involved with Jaime King, then, Pamela Anderson in 2001. Robert Ritchie Jr.âs dad married Pamela Anderson in July 2006, their short lived marriage ended the same year in November 2006.\n\nRitchie Jr. Is An Aspiring Singer\n\nIt may not be surprising to know that the son of Kid Rock is an upcoming singer. Apart from his dad, he has been inspired by Bruno Mars and Jackie Wilson. In 2018, he released his first single titled Exstacy and then in 2022, he made a collaboration with his dad.\n\nFrom the look of things, Robert hopes to build a solid career for himself in the music industry like his father has done. But aside from doing music, Kid Rockâs son has a regular job which helps him to cater for his family.\n\nRobert James Ritchie Jr. Is A Father\n\nEven though Robert James Ritchie Jr. seems to be following in his fatherâs footsteps in terms of career, he has also proven to be different from his glamorous father in many ways. Unlike his dad who is a party-lover, he is a homebody and spends most of his time with his family.\n\nRitchie Jr. also has a more stable relationship life as he tied the knot with his high school lover, Marisa Trovato, on October 2, 2021.
