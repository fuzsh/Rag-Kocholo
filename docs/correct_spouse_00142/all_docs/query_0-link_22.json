        "text": "Pamela Anderson Explained How \"Borat\" Destroyed Her Relationship With Kid Rock\n\n\"When I walked in, Bob was smashing a photo on the wall. He said he was sick of waking up to a picture of me and David LaChapelle every day.\"\n\nYou might remember when Pamela Anderson dated Kid Rock, if you're of a certain age. They were together on-and-off for a decent amount of the 2000s and got married in 2006 before splitting for good a few months later.\n\nIt's possible you also remember Pamela's cameo in the 2006 comedy Borat. (You know Borat, right? Of course you do.) Here it is, if you forgot:\n\nFor a long time, it was rumored that Pamela's Borat cameo essentially destroyed her marriage to Kid Rock — and, according to Pamela, that's kind of exactly how it went down.\n\nIn her new memoir Love, Pamela (via Entertainment Weekly), Pamela says that her Borat cameo apparently enraged Kid Rock — or Robert Ritchie, if you're getting legal with it — to the point where their relationship ended completely.\n\n\"I didn't tell Bob I was in the movie, because I wanted to surprise him,\" she wrote regarding the film's premiere, where her cameo was first revealed. \"I forgot about the part in the film that referenced the 'sex tape.'\"\n\n\"Bob stormed out, calling me a whore and worse. He was embarrassed, and his reaction was not thought through.\"\n\nPamela claimed that Kid Rock \"peeled out\" and completely ditched her at the premiere — and when she got home, he was continuing to act aggressively.\n\n\"When I walked in, Bob was smashing a photo on the wall,\" she wrote. \"He said he was sick of waking up to a picture of me and David LaChapelle every day. But it wasn't me and David — it was Marilyn Monroe and Bert Stern.\"\n\n\"We broke up. I didn't stay in touch with Bob.\"\n\nYou can pick up a copy of Love, Pamela now if you want to read more about Pamela's relationship with Kid Rock, as well as her entire life in general.\n\nShare This Article"
