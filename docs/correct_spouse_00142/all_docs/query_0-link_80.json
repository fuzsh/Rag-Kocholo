        "text": "In a true quickie wedding, Pamela Anderson and Rick Salomon planned to marry Saturday evening between the former “Baywatch” star’s performances on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nAnderson planned to squeeze in the nuptials between the 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. shows of “Hans Klok’s The Beauty of Magic” at Planet Hollywood resort, casino spokeswoman Amy Sadowsky said. Anderson, 40, is starring as a magician’s assistant.\n\nSalomon, 38, is best-known for making a sex videotape with Paris Hilton, his girlfriend at the time, and was previously married to actress Shannen Doherty. Anderson was previously married to singer Kid Rock and Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee.\n\nLohan checks out of rehab\n\nLindsay Lohan has checked out of a drug and alcohol treatment program in Utah that she entered in August, according to People magazine.\n\nLohan, 21, left the Cirque Lodge treatment center on Friday afternoon, the magazine reported on its Web site, citing statements from her parents.\n\n“I’m proud of her. She’s moving ahead with her life,” her mother, Dina, told People on Friday. “Things were getting out of control. She took action. She took responsibility. She really needed to heal.”\n\nSpringsteen, wife sued over horse\n\nBruce Springsteen and his wife are being sued, accused of backing out of a contract to buy a horse worth $850,000 for their teenage daughter.\n\nOlympic equestrian Todd Minikus filed the breach of contract lawsuit Thursday in Florida’s Palm Beach County. It claims Springsteen and Patti Scialfa reneged on a deal to pay Minikus $650,000 for the horse, named Pavarotti, and give him their horse named Scarlett, worth $200,000.\n\nThe lawsuit says the couple put a $25,000 deposit on Pavarotti in July but later had second thoughts about whether the horse was right for their daughter Jessica.\n\nMinikus, a former member of the U.S. Equestrian Team, claims the couple had a change of heart after he rode the 10-year-old gelding at the Pan American Games in Brazil. That event was held after the contract was signed but before the transaction was complete, he says."
