        "text": "So now the news is out, Pam Anderson and Kid Rock (Mr. Rock?) have split up after 4 months (that’s almost 125 days!) of marital bliss.\n\nMy, my – who’d have ever thought that would happen?\n\nThe thing is, the same way kids model themselves after superstar athletes and fashion divas, Americans are SOO obsessed with pop culture and celebrities, it’s a contributing factor to the high rate of divorce we’re experiencing. If Pam Anderson can get into and out of marriages faster than she can get into and out of a car lease, then why shouldn’t everyone else expect this to be the norm?\n\nAfter all, we model our clothes after celebrities… our expressions… our thoughts on world politics and religions… what we’re eating… raising children… the influence is HUGE. Marriage and divorce are no different.\n\nWhen you see this enough, it becomes the norm. It’s what Cialdini calls “Social Proof” in “The Psychology Of Persuasion”. He says, and I quote, “The tendency to see an action as more appropriate when others are doing it normally works quite well. As a rule, we will make fewer mistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than contrary to it. Usually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing to do.”\n\nThis, by the way, is why testimonials are so effective.\n\nLet’s face it, marriage — and relationships in general — are difficult. You need to be constantly committed, and you need to work to make them thrive. Two things that don’t come easy for most people.\n\nHeck, I’ve got a GREAT marriage and we still need to “work it” or else it’ll stop working. And so does Pam. No matter HOW hot she is.\n\nNow go sell something, Craig Garber\n\nGet Out Of The RAT RACE!: In this month’s Seductive Selling Newsletter (which you only have TWO days left to get your hands on), you’ll discover what the word commitment REALLY means, how one man rode his commitment straight out of the “rat race,” and how much he was willing to gamble to get there.
