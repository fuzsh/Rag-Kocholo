        "text": "A year after Pamela Anderson has tied the knot for the fifth time, she filed for divorce from bodyguard Dan Hayhurst.\n\nThe couple originally married on Christmas Eve in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWho is Pamela Anderson's ex-husband Dan Hayhurst?\n\nDan Hayhurst is the ex-husband of Pamela Anderson after serving as her bodyguard.\n\nShe filed for divorce in January 2022 after a little over a year into their marriage, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nAn insider revealed that “Pamela loves as authentically as she lives” and the “pandemic whirlwind” love with Dan fizzled out.\n\nThey were married on Christmas Eve 2020 at her home on Vancouver Island a few months into dating, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\"I'm exactly where I need to be - in the arms of a man who truly loves me,\" she told the outlet at the time.\n\nHayhurst lived locally on Vancouver Island when the couple met during the coronavirus lockdown in 2020.\n\n\"This one year together has felt like seven - like dog years,\" Anderson told the Daily Mail.\n\nShe added: \"I am in love. We were married Christmas Eve with both our families' blessing, everyone we know is happy for us.\n\n\"I was married on the property I bought from my grandparents 25 years ago, this is where my parents were married and they are still together.\n\n\"I feel like I've come full circle.\"\n\nWho has Anderson been married to?\n\nAnderson has also been married to Tommy Lee, Kid Rock - and to Rick Salomon twice.\n\nAnderson and Jon Peters infamously split last in 2020 after reports surfaced they were married.\n\nShe has claimed she \"was never married\" to Peters, likening their short romance to \"just a bizarre lunch.\"\n\nA statement on the actress' social media page read: \"Pamela Anderson was never legally married to Jon Peters (life long family friend) no hard feelings - no Marriage, no Divorce... just a bizarre theatrical lunch - Pamela has a good sense of humor about it.\"\n\nIt was previously revealed Pam dated Jon for just \"three days\" before the pair decided to get married.\n\nThe star and Jon first met in the 1980s but after reuniting following Pamela's stint at a month-long spiritual retreat, the pair spent only three days together before Jon dropped down to one knee.\n\nPamela revealed on February 1 that they were splitting and attempting to \"take some time apart to re-evaluate what we want from life and from one another,\" however, sources close to the ex-actress have revealed that part of the problem was what Pamela saw as warning signs."
