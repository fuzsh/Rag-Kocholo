        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Citing concern for her children and the media frenzy over her impending divorce, actress Pamela Anderson said she wants to resolve her break up with singer Kid Rock \"amicably\" and \"with dignity.\"\n\n\"I'm very concerned with the press on mine and Bob's divorce ... my children can read -- and I'd like to resolve this amicably -- not fuelling fires -- and with dignity,\" Anderson wrote in a posting yesterday at pamelaanderson.com.\n\nRock's real name is Bob Ritchie. The singer, 35, and Anderson, 39, were married only about four months ago and both filed for divorce earlier this week in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nAnderson is well-known as a Playboy magazine model and star of television shows such as Baywatch. She recently played herself in comedy film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan in which she was the object of the lead character's sexual obsession.\n\nRock has made a name for himself with a hybrid style of rap and hard rock that has won fans around the world for hit albums such as 1998's Devil Without a Cause.\n\nThe two were married in late July on a yacht outside the French Riviera city of St. Tropez, and then held other ceremonies in various US cities.\n\nSince reports the couple filed for divorce first surfaced, many stories have appeared in newspapers and on the Web citing reasons for the break-up such as Rock being upset over Anderson's appearance in Borat and her feeling that Rock had unresolved anger issues.\n\nNone of the stories have been confirmed by Anderson or Rock, and spokespersons for both declined to comment today.\n\n\"Kids don't know the difference between fact and tabloid ... does anybody?\" Anderson wrote on her website. \"Truth is Bob is great in many ways -- we just don't belong together ... we mutually agree.\"\n\nCanadian-born Anderson was previously married to rocker Tommy Lee of the band Motley Crue, and they have two children. Ritchie has one son with former girlfriend Kelley South Russell.\n\n- REUTERS"
