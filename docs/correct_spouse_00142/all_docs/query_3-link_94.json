        "text": "This is part two of a long post. For part one, please visit: https://imnotstalkingyou.com/2014/05/20/yes-kid-rock-i-have-stalked-you-part-1/\n\nSo, that video shoot my friend told me about? Turned out, the video shoot for ‚ÄúForever‚Äù was going to be held at the Michigan State Fairgrounds (now extinct) the NEXT weekend, and it would be widely announced by the local media. It was also being filmed by MTV‚Äôs Making the Video show. I was so psyched!\n\nMy friend and I went to Meijer late the night before so that I could buy one of those red markers to draw on your car windows with. I also bought stuff to make sandwiches for lunch for all of us the next day. Then I drove all the way home. By then it was the middle of the freakin‚Äô night, and I had to turn around and get up early and pick up my friends and drive to the Michigan State Fairgrounds.\n\nWhile it would be 30 degrees warmer in 4 days, it was only around a high of maybe 40 degrees that day at the wide open fairgrounds. The wind whipped through. The thrill of being at an actual music video kept us going for a while. First thing to be filmed was some monster trucks. Then we finally got to see Kid Rock, as he rode out on his own Monster Truck. My husband ran up with the rest of the crowd and took a picture.\n\nThen there was more time waiting while they set up the stage for the performance scenes. I think we snuck off to our car to try and find some respite from the terrible windchill. We ate our sandwiches. We never really warmed up. We returned to the set.\n\nThe band finally came out and started getting set up. Uncle Kracker came out at the far end of the stage from us. By this time, he had already released his own album, toured, and had a few hits (depending on how you define a ‚Äúhit‚Äù). And yet, no one was saying anything! So, my green-haired friend and I started chanting ‚ÄúKracker! Kracker! Kracker!‚Äù The crowd picked it up. Then Kracker looked up at the crowd and smiled a big, goofy grin. We all cheered. That is my most favorite memory from that day. Uncle Kracker doesn‚Äôt know it, but that smile was for us, because we started the chant.\n\nThen Kid Rock came out, explaining that they have to do several takes while lip-syncing to the original track. If I stood on my toes, I could see Pamela Anderson at the side of the stage. After that, he performed some of his hits for us. There was this group of young kids in front of us, 17 years old maybe? The one girl in their group had obviously never been in a pit before and just complained about EVERYTHING! ‚ÄúOh my God, stop pushing!‚Äù I was a concert veteran by now. I knew by now, you had to accept the pushing and shoving or get the f*ck out. Eventually, that party left, helping us to move closer to the stage. I may have pushed her a few times, on purpose, to speed that along üòâ Yup, Kid Rock had helped me find my inner American Bad Ass.\n\nAfter that, they shot a scene where a girl in a bikini was supposed to be thrown in the air off of an American flag. My husband was holding onto the edge, but somehow he did not end up still holding on to it when the cameras started rolling.\n\nBy the time that scene was over, it was dark. I was so cold and starving, that Kid Rock himself probably would have had to come out and convince me to stay. We got in the car and left. By that time, there were very few people still there.\n\nWhen we watched the finished music video later, we would see that we probably missed our best chance at meeting Kid Rock. The final scenes shot were those of him actually walking through the crowd. And I can tell you, the people you see in the scene are the ONLY ONES still there. Everyone else had left due to the cold.\n\nHere is the ‚ÄúForever‚Äù music video. Try to find me in it. I still do‚Ä¶\n\nI can‚Äôt believe that none of the four of us ended up in the finished video OR the MTV Making The Video. And my green-haired friend‚Äôs brother is like 7 feet tall (not quite). How does that not show up in every shot?\n\nI saw Kid Rock on the Cocky tour three times in 2002. I stood in line to buy tickets when they went on sale to see him at the Palace of Auburn Hills. By then, there were so many people in line, Ticketmaster was doing a stupid random number draw to decide where people fell in line. I ended up purchasing my tickets about ten minutes after they went on sale. The seats I ended up with were clear up by the ceiling. It was RIDICULOUS! That would have been a miserable show, except for there were two college guys in the row in front of me who were dancing and singing along with every word, just as I was. That made the bad seats a little easier to take.\n\nThat same week, I bought tickets for Kid Rock at the Toledo Sports Arena (a MUCH smaller venue) four days after they went on sale. I was still able to get General Admission tickets. By the end of that concert, I had pushed my way up to second row from the stage. When Kid Rock came out with a shot gun to shoot out the lights, I was just a little scared! It was impressive. I was so close to my obsession, but there was no way to get closer.\n\nIn September, I saw him at DTE Energy Theatre. We only had lawn tickets. I had come to the conclusion that there was no way to get close tickets for Kid Rock in his ‚Äúhometown‚Äù of Detroit. My green-haired friend and I had been to that venue many times by now. I knew the back way into the place that usually resulted in quick parking. But this show had a problem. People were coming and tailgating in the parking lot‚ÄìPEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS TO THE SHOW!!!! It caused a horrible traffic jam. It was then that I decided never to buy tickets for a Kid Rock show in Detroit again. It was throwing your money away. There was just no way to get close to him.\n\nWe were late. We ran as fast as we could from the gates to the stage. We could hear Kid Rock and Run-D.M.C. performing together. They left the stage just as we rounded the corner in view of the stage. We never saw them.\n\nJam Master Jay would be shot and murdered a month later. We had missed one of the final performances of RUN-D.M.C. by 60 seconds. It haunts me still.\n\nSomehow by the end of that concert, my friend and I made it into the top of the pavilion seats. Which was awesome, because during his performance of ‚ÄúEarly Mornin‚Äô Stoned Pimp‚Äù, when Kid Rock wears his long fur coat and pimp hat with the feather in it, metallic confetti was dropped from the ceiling. It may have even been one of his encores. It was just such an awesome and moving experience. Part of that could have also been that the people in front of us were smoking pot.\n\nThe following is a journal entry about the show. Remember, I had already disclosed that I was obsessed‚Ä¶\n\nKid Rock @ DTE 9/13/02\n\nI have been to church*\n\nIt has been such a long time.\n\nLook at my fellow followers.\n\nThe congregation. Up at the sky.\n\nWe love our god. He gives us power, energy, life.\n\nHe is so trashy/rude-but at the same time points out things in our society that we take too seriously. He reminds us life can be fun, in addition to the misery. He melodically puts us on a higher level.\n\nLook at the clouds. Look at the sky. Look at the congregation grooving en mass. Feel the worn but wonderful as it courses through our bodies. This may be my last chance for awhile to chant in unison with my god. I am at church.\n\n*I think ‚Äúchurch about every Kid Rock show I go to.\n\nIt was such a great show. On the way out, I found a Kid Rock wife beater laying in the parking lot, fresh from the souvenir stand. That was probably a $30 value right there. I would wear it to many future concerts.\n\nIn November 27, 2003, we went to see Uncle Kracker perform at the Emerald Theatre. And yes, I was hoping Kid Rock would make an appearance. It was a great show at a great theater, but no Kid Rock.\n\nAt some point in all this, my crazy friend‚Äôs best friend did the hair of someone who knew what road Kid Rock lived on in Ortonville. (It was pretty common knowledge that he lived in Ortonville, Michigan at that time.) So, we all planned a weekend field trip to try to find his house. Except, well, the best friend couldn‚Äôt remember for sure what road the customer had said. We saw lots of scenic Ortonville. We took pictures of the different roads and houses we found, in case they were it. We unknowingly drove past a bar he regularly visited like six times and never stopped.\n\nMy crazy friend had access to online real estate records at the time. When she got home, she did a property search. She emailed me both the parcel info, and an aerial picture of the house. I won‚Äôt include those here. I also won‚Äôt tell you the address, but the road rhymes with my maiden name. Here is the picture I took of Kid Rock‚Äôs front gate:\n\nIt is my pride and joy. I used to display it proudly in my cubicle at my old office job. We didn‚Äôt try to go past the gate because we did not want Kid Rock to shoot us.\n\nAlthough, that would have been a GREAT story!\n\nI have no idea if he still lives there or not. That was over ten years ago.\n\nSadly, I have not seen Kid Rock since 2002. I saw him a total of six times. I loved the rap rock thing, but I always liked the rare song on a CD where he sang, especially a dark version I have of the Hank Williams Jr. song ‚ÄúA Country Boy Can Survive‚Äù. I always wanted him to sing more. On his newer albums, he did just that. But, then, I wished that he would rap more.\n\nI still love his old stuff, but my obsession has faded. I don‚Äôt follow his new stuff. I had to get rid of my cardboard standee. It took up too much room in my one bedroom apartment. All my concert T-shirts got worn out. My husband and I moved into our house, and my CD collection got stashed in a chest that gets cluttered on top, making it hard to access my CDs.\n\nI have met a lot of celebrities. Probably more than my fair share. Check out my ‚ÄúWhen Stars Align‚Äù page if you don‚Äôt believe me. I wish I had met Kid Rock before he was famous. I am sure he was playing little dive bars in Detroit. It was possible. I just didn‚Äôt know that he existed. That is the dream, I guess. To meet a famous person before the fame sets in and they become unreachable.\n\nI did actually get to meet the band Good Charlotte at the height of their fame. But, well, that is a story for another day.\n\nAt this point, I am waiting for Kid Rock to lose popularity. Maybe someday he will come to the county fair and I will be able to meet him when no one else wants to."
