        "text": "Pam Anderson & Kid Rock to Wed\n\nTUESDAY JULY 18, 2006 02:25PM EST\n\nPamela Anderson and her beau, Kid Rock, are getting married, a source close to the Baywatch star confirms to PEOPLE.\n\n\"I'm finally getting remarried...it's been a whirlwind...spontaneous but well thought through,\" says the actress on her Web site.\n\nThough she does not name Kid Rock in the note, which was posted Tuesday, the source tells PEOPLE that the couple plan to tie the knot on July 29, on a yacht near Saint-Tropez, where they recently celebrated Anderson's 39th birthday.\n\n\"I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle,\" Anderson writes. \"Well my miracle came and went. And came back and came back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing. I'm moving on ... I feel like I'm finally free ... I'm in love. I'm happy.\"\n\nAnderson was previously married to drummer Tommy Lee, with whom she has two sons, Dylan, 8, and Brandon, 10.\n\nSource: http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1215945,00.html\n\nApparently they're planning to do a 'wedding tour'\n\n(andPOP) Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock are once again set for marriage -- many times over. \"I'm going to get married a few times this month to the same guy,\" said the 39-year-old ex-Baywatch actress during a news conference for her poker Web site, PamelaPoker.com. Reuters reports that Anderson's initial wedding will take place around St. Tropez, France, possibly on Saturday. After the first ceremony, the couple will embark on a celebratory tour of the U.S., with more weddings along the way. \"We had to do Malibu, we've got to do Detroit, and we've got to do Nashville,\" said Anderson. No other details about the ceremonies were offered.\n\neitmonline.com\n\nMaybe a mod can rename the title of the thread? I really didn't want to start another thread on the divorce since they just married a few months ago.....They are getting divorced already. So shocking!\n\nFROM TMZ:\n\nTMZ has learned that Pamela Anderson has filed for divorce from husband Kid Rock.\n\nAnderson, who is represented by celebrity hotshot lawyer Neal Hersh, cited irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe couple was married August 3, 2006. Earlier this month, Anderson suffered a miscarriage.\n\nIt looks like there was a rush to the courthouse. Kid Rock also filed divorce papers this morning, 53 minutes before her docs were stamped by the clerk.\n\nInterestingly, Pam and Kid Rock each give a different date of separation. She says they split on November 21. He says November 26.\n\nWe've learned there was not a prenup, however, the two were married for such a brief period of time it will probably have little impact.\n\nPam's website offers a short statement confirming the divorce, saying \"Yes, it's true. Unfortunately impossible.\""
