        "text": "Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock said \"I do\" at a fabled Nashville honky-tonk in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nA Nashville judge performed the ceremony — one of several around the world — just after midnight at Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, said Kirt Webster, Kid Rock's Nashville-based publicist.\n\nAnderson and Kid Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, first tied the knot July 29 near St. Tropez, France. The couple has also celebrated in Beverly Hills, Calif., and Detroit, Mich., besides Tennessee, according to Anderson's Web site.\n\nThe bride and groom both wore white — hers a minidress and his a tank top.\n\nKid Rock, who owns a condo in Nashville, later took the stage at Tootsie's and sang Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and Hank Williams Jr.'s \"Family Tradition,\" Webster said.\n\nThe newlyweds partied for a few hours following the ceremony at a Nashville restaurant and planned another party for Thursday night at an undisclosed location, he said.\n\n\"It was a good time,\" said Webster, who served as one of the witnesses to the nuptials. \"All the people that were there, the fans, they had a good time.\n\nAnderson and Kid Rock were first engaged in April 2002 and broke up the following year before setting a wedding date. Anderson, 39, has two sons from her marriage to rocker Tommy Lee. Ritchie has a son."
