        "text": "Part of the mockumentary sees Cohen's character become obsessed with Anderson and plot to kidnap her. The movie also references Anderson's infamous sex tape with Mötley Crüe drummer, Tommy Lee.\n\nAnderson claims in the book that Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, reacted badly to the mention of the tape in the film.\n\nShe wrote: \"I didn't tell Bob I was in the movie, because I wanted to surprise him. I forgot about the part in the film that referenced the 'sex tape.' Bob stormed out, calling me a whore and worse. He was embarrassed, and his reaction was not thought through.\"\n\nAnderson went on to say that Kid Rock left her at the premiere, and she had to go back inside to ask for someone else to take her home instead.\n\nRelated stories\n\nShe added: \"After I chased Bob to his car, he peeled out, leaving me there alone. I turned back and apologized, then asked if anyone could give me a ride home.\"\n\nThe star said that things hadn't calmed down by the time she returned home, and claimed Kid Rock was smashing a photo hanging on the wall.\n\nAnderson said: \"When I walked in, Bob was smashing a photo on the wall. He said he was sick of waking up to a picture of me and David LaChapelle every day. But it wasn't me and David — it was Marilyn Monroe and Bert Stern.\"\n\nThe book also sees Anderson recall a moment when she claims she walked in on Jack Nicholson during a threesome at the Playboy Mansion, as well as her \"slightly frisky\" night with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nRepresentatives for Kid Rock could not immediately be reached for comment."
