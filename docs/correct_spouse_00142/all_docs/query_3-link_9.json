        "text": "Pamela Anderson has filed for divorce from Kid Rock after less than four months of marriage, the actress' publicist said Monday.\n\nAnderson's representative said the former \"Baywatch\" star filed for divorce last week, but would not comment on the reason or any particulars of the divorce. The split was first reported by People magazine.\n\nA publicist for Kid Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, didn't immediately return messages left by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe relationship between Anderson, 39, and Ritchie, 35, has been a turbulent one since they became engaged in 2002. They broke up the following year, but later reunited and this summer embarked on a tour of wedding ceremonies.\n\nHonestly, I find the relationships of celebrities so funny and trivial at the same time, honestly there is not one couple of really famous celebrities that has stayed together for more then a year... It's quite sad considering quite a lot of people idolize these people...\n\nThis particular divorce meant absolutely nothing to me. I don't know or care about these particular two actors\n\nEither way, as Lizidian says, I find it a bunch of BS that these people even get married. The reason they break up is because they're both not willing to put forth continuous effort to stay together, which happens with just about everyone (married people put forth effort, divorced people did not). If you can't even stay together, why do you marry to break apart later? Doesn't make any sense to me, except to demean the meaning of marriage to the confused Americans."
