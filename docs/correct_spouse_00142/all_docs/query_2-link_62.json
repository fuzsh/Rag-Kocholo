        "text": "DETROIT (CBS/AP) Tickets to Kid Rock's Jan. 15 birthday bash sold out in 19 minutes and the Detroit rocker is not happy about it.\n\nOr rather, he is not happy about the number of tickets that went to scalpers who will hike prices for fans.\n\nPICTURES: Kid RockPICTURES: Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson\n\nThe country rocker with hip-hop roots says on his website that he would love to confront scalpers who swoop in and buy blocks of his low-priced tickets, then resell them for profit.\n\nIn a posts titled \"Fans Upset about Ford Field Tickets and What Not,\" he says it leaves him feeling \"like someone is beating up a close friend or family member while\" he's chained to a chair.\n\n\"If I could confront each and every one of them face to face,\" he wrote, \" I would and it would not work out well for them I guarantee all of you.\"\n\nThe musician, who said the post was not approved by his manager or publicist, said he has consulted people in the industry about ways to stop scalping but has not yet come up with a satisfactory solution.\n\nThe Michigan native, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, grew up in Romeo and now lives in Clarkston.\n\nHe has sold more than 180,000 tickets during the past 14 months for shows in the Detroit area and last appeared providing halftime entertainment at the Detroit Lion's annual Thanksgiving Day NFL game."
