        "text": "Actress Pamela Anderson has filed for divorce from rap singer Kid Rock after four months of marriage, a pair of celebrity magazines reported on Monday.\n\n\"Pamela filed for divorce last week,\" Anderson's publicist, Tracy Nguyen, told People magazine. \"It wasn't a happy Thanksgiving.\"\n\nAnderson's representative said the star filed for divorce last week, but would not comment on the reason or any particulars of the divorce.\n\nA publicist for Kid Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nA second magazine, US Weekly, said the divorce papers cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason the two broke up.\n\nCanadian-born Anderson, star of TV shows such as Baywatch and a Playboy magazine model, and Rock, whose hit songs include 1998's Devil Without a Cause, were married in late July aboard a yacht near the French Riviera city of St Tropez.\n\nThe relationship between Anderson, 39, and Ritchie, 35, has been a turbulent one since they became engaged in 2002.\n\nThey broke up the following year, but later reunited and this summer embarked on a tour of wedding ceremonies.\n\nThey wed in late July near St Tropez, France, and again at a courthouse in Beverly Hills, California, on August 3. They tied the knot a third time on August 17 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\"Yes, I'm finally getting remarried ... I'm in love. I'm happy,\" Anderson wrote on her website, pamelaanderson.com, back in July.\n\nEarlier this month, Anderson's spokesman, Tracy Nguyen, confirmed that Anderson recently suffered a miscarriage. The pregnancy was not believed to be far along.\n\nAnderson - who was born in British Columbia, Canada - was previously married to rock star Tommy Lee, of Motley Crue fame, for three years from 1995 to 1998."
