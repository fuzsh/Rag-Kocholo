        "text": "Rock was promoting his upcoming performance at KROQ’s LA Invasion, which takes place on Saturday at the Home Depot Center in Carson, during the phone-in interview. He told the DJs he had been advised not to talk about the fracas, but decided to do so anyway.\n\n“I’ve been instructed not to talk from my attorneys, but I can’t live â¦ ‘cause it’s just not right,” Rock said. “The one thing you gotta remember, because there are kids involved, my kid has to go to school and hear about it so I try to be careful with what I do and what I say.\n\n“This is the situation,” he continued, “it was unavoidable. This has been a lot of years of very disrespectful things. The last contact I had with him was when me and Pam [Anderson] were going through our divorce. He picked up her blackberry and started emailing me a lot of horrendous things, just coming at me and I said to him that day, I said ‘ . . . I will see you again,’ and that’s all I had to say and it was extremely disrespectful.”\n\nTommy Lee himself posted a blog earlier this week on TommyLee.TV, recounting his version of events. In his statement, the Motley Crue drummer implied the two had a friendly relationship, by suggesting he got up to try and “semi hug,” Kid.\n\n“So I get a tap on the shoulder from Kid Pebble . . . I stand up and embrace him with a semi hug and say ‘Hey dude, what up?’” Lee wrote. “He punches me in the face . . . Well if ya’ wanna call it that!? More like a bitch slap! Wuss.”\n\nBoth men were forced to leave the show following the incident. Lee was physically escorted out, while Rock was allowed to walk out on his own. Rock was later cited for misdemeanor battery. He will have to return to Las Vegas to face the charge at a later date.\n\nWhile many suspected the altercation had to do with the ex-wife of both men – Pamela Anderson, Rock denied the suggestion in his KROQ interview.\n\n“It had absolutely zero to do with Pam,” he noted. “The best thing I did was file for that divorce. And you have to go through these things to realize that. I was in love with her, I went through it, I did what I had to do and thank God I got out of it.”\n\nRock, who has kept quiet about his divorce from the former “Baywatch” babe, said in Thursday’s interview, his marriage to Pam was a “circus.”\n\n“I knew it was a bad career move to begin with to get involved with her and everything around her,” he told the DJs. “Your life becomes this frickin’ circus, because that’s what she wants is this media attention and my first love is music, and now you gotta look like the clown because you’re involved with her and then you’ve got this joker of an ex-husband over here who comes in and tries to stir things up and make blogs and do inconvenient things with the kids.”\n\nKid said he hopes what happened between the two men at the VMAs resolves any lingering tension.\n\n“We got (sic) mutual friends and that’s fine. And I really don’t wish anything that bad on anybody at the end of the day,” he said. “There’s (sic) certain people I don’t believe in and I’ve really never had problems with anybody. I’ve always gotten along with people so it is what it is â¦ hopefully that’s the end of it . . . [Tommy –] down deep you had it coming, leave it alone now, just go your own way . . . let that be the end of it.”"
