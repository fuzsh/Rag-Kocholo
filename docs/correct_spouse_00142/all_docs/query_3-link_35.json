        "text": "According to www.marksfriggin.com, Howard Stern had Pamela Anderson on his show Thursday morning (June 26). \"Howard asked Pam why she's shocked when she goes out with someone like Kid Rock or Tommy Lee and then everyone wants to know about it. Howard told her that she brought them through the whole relationship so she should talk about the break-up with Kid Rock. Howard said he heard that Pam was messing around with [LIMP BIZKIT's] Fred Durst and Kid Rock found out about it. Pam said that's not what happened and she has only spoken to him. She met him at this Playboy party she was at and that was it. Howard went on to talk about how cool Kid Rock was about Pam and how in love he seemed to be when he was with her. Pam said that Tommy Lee is the father of her kids and will always be in her life. Howard seems to think that she's back together with Tommy but she said she's not. She said she's got this cartoon coming out and this Tommy Lee/Kid Rock thing is getting in the way. Howard asked Pam if she's banged Tommy Lee in the past month. She said she wouldn't tell him if she was or wasn't so Howard took that as being a 'yes.' Howard asked her if she's horny. She said she is even though it hasn't been that long since she got it. Howard figures that Kid Rock just didn't know how to give it to Pam hard enough. Pam said Bob (Kid Rock) was going to kill her if she talked about this stuff. She said he's a great guy and didn't want Howard talking about that stuff. Pam said that they didn't get to see each other enough because the commute was too far for them. Howard wondered if Kid Rock was backing of with the sex because of the Hepatitis C thing. She said she's actually getting healthier now so that wasn't it. Howard asked Pam to swear on her mother's life that she hadn't slept with Tommy Lee in the past 3 months. She said she never swears on her mother so that wasn't happening. Howard said that means she probably has done him then. Howard wanted to know the truth about Pam and Kid Rock's break up. She said she wanted Kid Rock to be a rock star and she wanted to be with her kids and close to their father. Pam said there was nothing bad that happened between them. There was just a lot of little things that brought the break up on. Howard took a few more phone calls for Pam and even more guys were asking about Tommy. She eventually said that she was pretty sure that she hadn't had sex with Tommy in the past year. She said she really didn't want to talk about Tommy or Bob. Howard wondered if Pam's vagina had to adjust from Tommy's big penis to Kid Rock's penis size. Robin [Howard's sidekick] said the vagina is flexible so it can adjust to stuff like that.\" Read more."
