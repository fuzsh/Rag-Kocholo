Have an account? .\n\nThe rock star-and-supermodel pairing has reigned supreme throughout the decades.\n\nSome like Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach have had enduring, decades-long relationships.\n\nOther celebrity couples like Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock have had wild-yet-brief romances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPattie Boyd and George Harrison's 11-year relationship, which started in 1964, was also reportedly full of high-profile affairs.\n\nThe Beatle met model Pattie Boyd on the set of his band's film \"A Hard Day's Night\" in 1964. They quickly had a courthouse wedding in 1966 and stayed together for 11 years. On one end, there was love — Boyd inspired The Beatles' love song \"Someday\" — and on the other, there were infidelities from both parties.\n\nThe most famous affairs were between Boyd and rock star Eric Clapton (more on that later) and between Harrison and Ringo Starr's wife, Maureen Starkey Tigrett.\n\nThe Beatles' tour manager, Chris O'Dell, wrote in his 2021 book that in 1970, \"[George] turned to Ringo and said: 'You know, Ringo, I'm in love with your wife,'\" as per the Express. This was the final straw for Pattie, who went on to divorce Harrison in 1974, which was finalized in 1977.\n\nStarr's biographer, Michael Seth Starr, wrote, \"Pattie, meanwhile, avenged George's betrayal by returning to her modeling career – something George had always forbidden,\" as per the Express.\n\nBoyd then had an affair with The Faces' (and The Rolling Stones') Ronnie Wood, as the rock star told the Daily Mail in 2007. In turn, Harrison had an affair with Wood's wife, Krissy Wood, Michael Seth Starr Starr told the Express.\n\nBoyd and Harrison stayed in touch, though, and Harrison even performed at Boyd's 1979 wedding to Clapton. Then in 2001, after suffering from cancer, the musician arranged to meet Boyd to say a final goodbye, months before his death, as per Smooth Radio.\n\nBoyd told the publication in 2022, \"When I left him for Eric, he had said that if things didn't work out, I could always come to him. It was such a selfless, loving thing to say.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile married to Harrison, Boyd started an affair with Eric Clapton, whom she later married and divorced.\n\nEric Clapton was friends with George Harrison when he met his wife, Pattie Boyd. Clapton fell for the taken model, telling Harrison in 1970, \"I'm in love with your wife,\" as revealed in his 2007 book \"Clapton: The Autobiography,\" the New York Post reported.\n\nWhen his advances went unacknowledged by Boyd, Clapton wrote the heartbreak song \"Layla\" with Derek and the Dominoes.\n\nIn her 2007 autobiography, Boyd wrote that Clapton made her listen to that song \"about a man who falls hopelessly in love with a woman who loves him but is unavailable.\" She added, \"My first thought was: 'Oh God, everyone's going to know this is about me,'\" as per the Daily Mail.\n\n\"With the realisation that I had inspired such passion and creativity, the song got the better of me. I could resist no longer,\" she wrote.\n\nClapton also wrote the 1977 song \"Wonderful Tonight\" about her.\n\nThe pair started their affair through the end of her marriage with Harrison, but Boyd left when Clapton apparently got close to another model. Once that fling was seemingly over, Boyd agreed to marry him during a tour stop in Arizona in 1979.\n\n\"It was like hitching a ride on a shooting star: a fantastic experience that caused immense pain, but I'm glad I had it,\" Boyd added in her book.\n\nClapton's affair with Italian TV personality Lory Del Santo led to a child in 1986, and prompted Boyd and Clapton's divorce in 1987.\n\nThe New York Times wrote that Clapton didn't defend himself or his actions in his autobiography. Clapton told the publication in 2007, \"I just tried to take responsibility for all the different phases of my life.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeith Moon started dating Annette Walter-Lax in 1974 and they stayed together before he died of a drug overdose four years later.\n\nThe Who's legendary drummer was formerly in a tumultuous marriage with model Kim Kerrigan, with whom he had a daughter. Towards the end of that relationship, he began dating model Annette Walter-Lax.\n\nTalking about their four-year relationship, Walter-Lax told Rock Cellar Magazine, \"The best thing about having Keith as a boyfriend was that he took me for an experience in my life that I had never thought in a million years was going to happen to me,\" also adding that the worst part was his \"dark side.\"\n\nThen on September 7, 1978, after the pair attended a movie screening and went home, Moon took prescribed alcohol treatment pills. The next morning, the model found her boyfriend dead at 32 years old, reportedly from an overdose from the pills.\n\n\"Had he not changed, our relationship wouldn't have lasted, I don't think,\" she said.\n\nShe wrote about their relationship in her 2019 book, \"The Last Four Years: A Rock Noir Romance.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRingo Starr and Barbara Bach have been together for over 40 years.\n\nBoth The Beatles' drummer, Ringo Starr, and editorial model-actress Barbara Bach were married with children prior to meeting at 40 and 33 years old, respectively. After The Beatles broke up and Bach had her big break as a Bond Girl in the 1977 film \"The Spy Who Loved Me,\" they met on the set of the 1980 film \"Caveman.\"\n\nThey married the following year. But the pair started their relationship by drinking heavily and taking hard drugs.\n\nStarr said in the documentary \"Still the Greatest,\" that he \"was told by the staff that I'd trashed the house so badly they thought there had been burglars, and I'd trashed Barbara so badly they thought she was dead,\" according to Grunge.\n\n\"It was their drugs hayday,\" Bach's daughter Francesca Gregorini told The Mirror in 2020.\n\nBecause of this, in 1988, both stars checked into rehab to deal with their drug and alcohol problems and came out stronger.\n\n\"There's no escape ... I think I love Barbara as much (today) as I did (when we met),\" Starr told Business Standard in 2015. \"And I'm beyond blessed that she loves me and we're still together.\"\n\nThey've been married for over 40 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeith Richards and Patti Hansen have also had a successful relationship for over 40 years.\n\nThe Rolling Stones' Keith Richards has had one of the most enduring relationships in rock history — he's still with wife, American model Patti Hansen, after 42 years.\n\nThe pair's birthdays have played pivotal roles in their relationship timeline. They met in 1979 on Hansen's 23rd birthday, then reconnected later that year on Richards' 36th birthday, and married in 1983 on his 40th birthday.\n\nRichards said he was set up to meet the \"Vogue\" cover model and face of Calvin Klein Jeans at her birthday party. \"When Patti and I met it was just ... boom,\" Richards told Vanity Fair in 2018, although he acknowledged that she was uninterested at first.\n\nIt wasn't until his birthday that they formed a connection and a relationship. They share two daughters together.\n\nRichards told GQ in 2015, \"Baby, what counts is family. This is what I did it for.\"\n\nHansen told Harper's Bazaar in 2011 that in the beginning, Richards would make her mixtapes, make collages, and write notes in his own blood. And although they dealt with a hectic rock 'n' roll lifestyle, substance abuse, and health issues, she added, \"I guess we've beaten what takes out most people.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter meeting in 1983, Christie Brinkley and Billy Joel were together for 10 years.\n\nWhen Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley met in 1983, they had both recently left relationships – Joel from his first wife, Elizabeth Weber, and Brinkley from race car driver Olivier Chandon de Brailles.\n\nBoth were vacationing in St. Barts when they met at a sing-along at an island bar, he told Rolling Stone in 1986.\n\n\"The music was the key to the introduction,\" Joel told the publication, adding, \"I got a crush on her right then and there.\"\n\nAfter returning home, Joel read that Brinkley's ex Chandon died in a car accident. He reached out, offering to be a friend in her time of need, which prompted their relationship. Brinkley then featured in the music video for \"Uptown Girl.\"\n\nThey married on a yacht in 1985 and had their daughter together later that year.\n\nIn a 1990 interview with Rolling Stone, Joel said their relationship didn't change them, just how people perceived them. \"Don't people realize that the minute the door closes, all of the silly rock star/supermodel stuff goes right out the window?\" he asked.\n\nBut in 1993, weeks after Joel's album \"River of Dreams\" was released, which Brinkley painted the cover art for, the couple announced they were separating. Brinkley cited differences in wanting to live on opposite sides of the country and Joel's busy tour schedule for the split, according to People. They officially divorced in 1995.\n\nIn 2019, Brinkley told People that she's still on good terms with the singer. \"Many years after our divorce, Billy would still come to my house for the Christmas singalong and play the piano,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaulina Porizkova and Ric Ocasek were together for 29 years. She made headlines for being removed from his will when he passed in 2019.\n\nThe Cars' frontman Ric Ocasek met the young and then-Sports Illustrated model Paulina Porizkova on the set of his band's 1984 music video \"Drive.\" Although he was married, he was intrigued by Porizkova.\n\n\"It was love at first sight,\" a producer on the video told Page Six, adding, \"He couldn't believe anyone that beautiful would want to be with him.\"\n\nThey married in 1989 and had two sons together. However, the model said in a 2021 interview that she felt her husband stopped loving her or paying her attention. When she gave an ultimatum to change his ways or divorce, Ocasek reportedly didn't put up a fight.\n\nThe couple separated in 2018, seemingly amicably, and continued living together as Ocasek was sick and Porizkova wanted to help. But in 2019, Ocasek died from heart disease. In 2020, she learned that he had removed her from his will because he felt \"abandoned.\"\n\nPorizkova was forced to leave her house.
