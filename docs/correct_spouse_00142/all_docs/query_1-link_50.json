        "text": "PAMELA Anderson has married her bodyguard in her fifth wedding after falling in love during Covid lockdown.\n\nThe Baywatch star has married Dan Hayhurst, it was announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm exactly where I need to be - in the arms of a man who truly loves me,\" Pamela told the Daily Mail.\n\nThis will be the 53-year-old's fifth marriage, after she was hitched to rockstar Tommy Lee, 58, Kid Rock, 50 and Rick Salomon, 53.\n\nThe stunner was seen wearing a white short-sleeved dress and a large veil, for her fifth wedding ceremony.\n\nShe carried a small bouquet of pink and white roses.\n\nThe groom Dan was more laid back, in a pair of black pants and an unbuttoned shirt.\n\nPamela and Dan read each other traditional vows during the Christmas Eve ceremony, which was officiated by a local pastor.\n\nOf the beautiful occasion, Pamela shared with the outlet: “I am in love. We were married Christmas Eve with both our families' blessing, everyone we know is happy for us.\n\n“I was married on the property I bought from my grandparents 25 years ago, this is where my parents were married and they are still together. I feel like I've come full circle.”\n\nThe ceremony took place in the backyard of the countryside estate located in the town of Ladysmith on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nShe added of the location: \"I think this romantic property has a lot of healing energy, I'm at peace here.\n\n\"It's a big property but a few people passing by could see the fairytale gown with the long Princess Diana veil dragging in the mud. Heaven.\"\n\nThe wedding cake was a simple, two-tiered vegan cake of double vanilla and triple coconut with a handblown glass deer, a pine tree and a glittery heart as the toppers.\n\nPam and Dan met at the start of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown last year, but the actress said \"the one year together has felt like seven – like dog years.\"\n\nHe lives locally on the island and the two quickly hit it off, with her calling it a \"natural fit.\"\n\nShe was previously married to Tommy Lee in the 1990s, and the two share sons Brandon, 23, and Dylan, 22.\n\nHer marriage with Tommy ended in a legal battle after a private sex tape was stolen by their electrician, Rand Gauthier.\n\nAfter desperately trying to stop it from seeing the light of day, the raunchy video was sold under the title 'Pam & Tommy Lee: Stolen Honeymoon.'\n\nThe relationship became toxic and after a series of violent outbursts between the former lovers, devastated Pam filed for divorce in 1998.\n\nIn the same year Tommy was put behind bars for six months after he was charged for felony spousal battery.\n\nHe had to do 200 hours of community service and dish out $6,200 to a women’s shelter.\n\nShe and Kid Rock then got married in the mid-2000s, before Pamela went on to marry to her last husband, Rick Salomon – twice.\n\nThe two got hitched in 2007, before having the marriage annulled the following year.\n\nAfter Pamela and Rick reconciled a few years later, they decided to give it all another try and got married again in 2014.\n\nThe second time was not the charm, and the duo got divorced in 2015.\n\nFive years later, she was rumored to have married Hollywood producer Jon Peters in January 2020, after the two had first dated decades earlier, but she's now revealed that wasn't true.\n\nIt was speculated that the pair got hitched early last year, before splitting just a month later, but Pamela explained it was a mock ceremony and not real.\n\nThe 53-year-old said: \"We were never married. He is a movie maker and… I guess he just needed a little attention?\"\n\nHer official account had also previously tweeted: \"Pamela Anderson was never legally married to Jon Peters (lifelong family friend) no hard feelings — no Marriage, no Divorce… just a bizarre theatrical lunch — Pamela has a good sense of humor about it (sic).\""
