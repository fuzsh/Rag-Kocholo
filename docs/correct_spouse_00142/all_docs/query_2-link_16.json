        "text": "Los Angeles – Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock each filed divorce papers today seeking to end their marriage of less than four months.\n\nAnderson’s representative would not comment on the reason or any particulars of the divorce. Anderson and Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, each cited “irreconcilable differences” in their divorce filings in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\n“Yes, it’s true,” Anderson wrote in a brief statement on her Web site. “Unfortunately impossible.” A message left with Ritchie’s attorney wasn’t immediately returned.\n\nThe relationship between Anderson, 39, and Ritchie, 35, has been a turbulent one since they became engaged in 2002. They broke up the following year, but later reunited and held several wedding ceremonies over the summer.\n\nThey were wed in late July near St. Tropez, France, and again at a courthouse in Beverly Hills on Aug. 3. They also tied the knot in an Aug. 17 ceremony in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nThe pair filed separate divorce petitions, about an hour apart, early today. Anderson reported their separation date as Nov. 21; Ritchie said it was Nov. 26.\n\nFirst word of the split was reported by “The Insider” syndicated news magazine.\n\nAnderson’s spokeswoman, Tracy Nguyen, confirmed earlier this month that the actress had suffered a miscarriage.\n\nThe actress has two sons, Brandon, 10, and Dylan, 8, from her marriage to rocker Tommy Lee. Ritchie, a Michigan native who owns a condo in Nashville, has a 13-year-old son, Bob Jr.\n\nAnderson appears in “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.” She has been filming “Blonde and Blonder.” Ritchie released his latest CD, “Live Trucker,” in February."
