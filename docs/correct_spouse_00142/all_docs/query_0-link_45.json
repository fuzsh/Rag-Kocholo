        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Pamela Anderson has filed for divorce from Kid Rock after less than four months of marriage, the actress' publicist said Monday.\n\nAnderson's representative said the former \"Baywatch\" star filed for divorce last week, but would not comment on the reason or any particulars of the divorce. The split was first reported by People magazine.\n\nA publicist for Kid Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, didn't immediately return messages left by The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe relationship between Anderson, 39, and Ritchie, 35, has been a turbulent one since they became engaged in 2002. They broke up the following year, but later reunited and this summer embarked on a tour of wedding ceremonies.\n\nThey were wed in late July near St. Tropez, France, and again at a courthouse in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Aug. 3. They tied the knot a third time in an Aug. 17 ceremony in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nEarlier this month, Anderson's spokesman, Tracy Nguyen, confirmed that Anderson recently suffered a miscarriage. The pregnancy was not believe to be far along.\n\nAnderson has two sons, Brandon, 10, and Dylan, 8, from her marriage to rocker Tommy Lee. Ritchie, a Michigan native who owns a condo in Nashville, has a 13-year-old son, Bob Jr."
