        "text": "Now this is a head-scratcher.\n\nSacha Baron Cohen claims his 2006 film, “Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan” is the reason for Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock’s divorce that same year.\n\nCohen says that the scene in which his fictional and highly controversial character Borat approaches Anderson and carries her out of a book signing is what caused the split. The character Borat first debuted on his satirical British show “Da Ali G Show,” which ran from 2000 to 2004.\n\n“We did that scene twice, actually,” Baron Cohen told The Daily Beast. “The first time we did it at a book signing and I grabbed her over my shoulder and ran out with her and no one did anything. I was like, what kind of fans are these?”\n\nHe claims that when he asked Anderson what she thought of the film all she texted back was that she was “getting divorced.”\n\n“I was like, ‘Why?’ And she goes, ‘The movie,’” claims Cohen. “And I thought it was a joke, but then a few weeks later they got divorced.”\n\nAnderson and Rock did get divorced the same month as the film came out, but the comedy film seems like an unlikely cause.\n\nCNN has reached out to Anderson and Rock’s representatives for comment."
