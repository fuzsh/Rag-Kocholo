        "text": "PAMELA ANDERSON has been accused of being a “home wrecker” after allegedly stealing her new man from another woman and breaking up a happy family of five.\n\nThe model and actress is accused of seducing handyman Dan Hayhurst — who she married on Christmas Eve — while he worked on her property in the Canadian town of Ladysmith and was in a relationship with another woman.\n\nOn Wednesday the 53-year-old former Baywatch star announced she had married her “bodyguard” Dan, 40, in what was her sixth wedding, to her fifth husband, saying: “I’m exactly where I need to be — in the arms of a man who loves me.”\n\nBut Dan’s heartbroken ex Carey, who had been living with him and bringing up his two children for the past five years, has told how she was blindsided by the affair and knew nothing of their marriage until she read about it online.\n\nShe said the pair started getting close early last year — while she and Dan were still together — before he finally moved out of their shared home and into Pam’s in July.\n\nCarey, 42, said: “This is not the lockdown love story which is being portrayed, it’s all a facade.\n\n“I decided to speak out because I want people to know that my almost five-year relationship, with three children involved, ended because of the affair Pam and Dan started while he was still with me.\n\n“It’s sad that people celebrate this and cheer them on, when it started with deceit, denials and life-shattering choices for all the people involved.\n\nWORM TURNED\n\n“It wasn’t this romance that happened overnight. He worked with her for over six months before any of that happened.\n\n\"He wasn’t her body-guard then, he is a handyman, she hired him to work on her house.\n\n“We were all totally blindsided by this, it’s been so hard for us. And it’s not just me and the kids, lots of people have been hurt by them. Dan has lost friendships and business relationships because of this.”\n\nMum-of-one Carey, from Vancouver Island, and Dan, then a single dad, got together around five years ago and she moved in with him on the mainland in Squamish, a town north of Vancouver, helping to bring up his two young children.\n\nThe couple then moved to Vancouver Island for a fresh start around four years ago.\n\nShe said: “We did everything together, like family vacations, family fishing trips, we worked on family projects together. It was always us.”\n\nBut their happy life was to change for ever after Dan was taken on as a building contractor to renovate Pamela’s home, set in five acres in Ladysmith.\n\nHe started work there in early autumn 2019, soon complaining to Carey about how “crazy” Pamela was and how difficult and demanding she was to work for.\n\nIn one text shared with The Sun, he wrote: “The dragon has been released! Talking about Pam.”\n\nIn January 2020, Pamela “married” film producer Jon Peters before splitting with him two weeks later, claiming it was never a real wedding.\n\nCarey said: “I would say, ‘What are you doing? You need to get out of that job. It’s crazy’. There was the crazy stint when she married that guy Jon Peters for two weeks.\n\n“She had told all the contractors she had got married so then when I saw the news about it I texted Dan.\n\n“He replied back saying, ‘Hahaha he’s older than her dad, but I think our money issues are over’, which he meant because the guy is rich.\n\n“I thought that was pretty ruthless of him. He really didn’t seem to get on with her at all.”\n\nCarey said things started to change at the end of last March, with Dan spending more and more time out of the house.\n\nShe continued: “The worm turned. Covid happened and it just seemed to happen overnight.\n\n“Dan would stay at her house and not come home, and here I am taking care of the kids.\n\n“At first he denied it when I confronted him but then, finally, I asked him, ‘Are you sleeping with Pam? He said, ‘All I’m going to say is I’ve crossed the line’.\n\n“At first he said, ‘I want you to stay in our house. I don’t want you to go. I just need to figure things out’.\n\n“Later he apologised to me. He said, ‘Carey, I love you. I don’t know what is going on right now. I’m not in my right head right now. I’m not in a good space’.\n\n“He asked me to give him time to figure things out so I just let him do what he was doing.\n\n\"And there was no turning back by then. I had met Pam and had gone to dinner with her. My daughter used to work for her. I couldn’t believe it.”\n\nDan and Pamela’s relationship continued to develop and last July he moved out of the home he shared with Carey and moved in with Pam.\n\nONE-SIDED STORY\n\nOn Wednesday Pam told an interviewer she had been with Dan a year, adding: “This one year together has felt like seven, like dog years.”\n\nCarey moved out of the shared house after Dan, and it is currently up for sale.\n\nShe claims he and Pam behave like teenagers, and said: “When he turned 40 last year she bought him a boat.\n\n“He’s smashed her car three times now, and her boat twice. It’s a walking mess. They sit on their property drinking — it’s like the Dan and Pam show.”\n\nPam claims she and Dan had the blessing of all their family and friends for their wedding, but Carey disputes this, saying: “No one was invited to the wedding.\n\n“It doesn’t even seem like a real wedding. Everything looks so controlled.”\n\nShe added: “He can be very manipulative so in a sense they are made for each other, but I don’t see this lasting. I’d be very surprised.\n\n“Dan and I never got married because I don’t ever want to.\n\n“To me it’s nothing, it’s a piece of paper and it causes problems when you want to get out of it.\n\n\"And he had told me, ‘I’ll never get married again’. And then here we are, six or eight months or whatever the hell they are into their relationship and they’re married.\n\n“I just think, ‘Wow, who are you? Who is the man I was with for five years?’ None of this makes sense.”\n\nCarey’s daughter Denise, 21, who worked as a labourer at Pam’s home, told The Sun of discovering Dan’s relationship: “I was shocked when I learned about it.\n\n“I just thought, ‘How can this even be a thing?’ I’m here working with them full-time and I had no idea.\n\n“And the fact that he had a family, we were a blended family, he has two young kids and obviously she’s quite a lot older.\n\n“What was his thought process? What was going on in his mind?\n\n“I was so shocked. It’s something so unreal, like something straight out of the movies. I can’t believe it. Everyone thinks it’s this lockdown love story and nobody knows that there was an affair and there’s this family involved.\n\n“And I think the hardest part is that people are being fed this one-sided fairytale story when in reality there’s so much more to it.\n\n“It’s damaged a lot of people’s lives. It’s been really difficult for my mum.\n\n“She totally stepped up and was a full-time mum to those kids. It’s been hard to watch her go through that.\n\n“There was no rough patch or things being bad at home, things were completely normal throughout the entire thing until this happened.\n\n“Pam doesn’t have the best marriage track record, that’s for sure. So when Covid is over and she can go back to travelling and whatnot, I really don’t see it working.”\n\nHow she got to hubby 5\n\nPAM married wild rocker Tommy in 1995 after knowing him for just 96 hours and had two kids with him, Brandon and Dylan.\n\nThe couple split after the Motley Crue drummer assaulted her and spent six months in jail. They divorced in 1998 but briefly reunited in 2008 before finally calling it quits again.\n\nSHE got engaged to the rapper and musician in 2002 but they later went their separate ways. But after getting back together they married in 2006.\n\nThey split later that year. Pam suffered a miscarriage while the pair were married and they divorced shortly afterwards, citing “irreconcilable differences”.\n\nIN 2007 Pam and professional poker player Rick got married at The Mirage hotel and casino in Las Vegas, but divorced just ten weeks later, citing the usual “irreconcilable differences” and the marriage was later officially annulled. They remarried in 2014 but got divorced for a second time in 2015.\n\nPAM first dated the film producer more than 30 years ago and they apparently tied the knot in a secret ceremony in January 2020.\n\nThey split after 12 days and the actress later claimed in an Instagram caption they were “never legally married” and it was just a “bizarre theatrical lunch”."
