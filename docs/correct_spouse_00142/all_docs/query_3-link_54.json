        "text": "No, that headline is not a typo. Actress Pamela Anderson has shared a lot about her life recently in the form of Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story and her new autobiography, Love, Pamela. In the documentary, Anderson discusses her failed marriage to Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee and describes him as the love of her life and says that every partner since has been jealous.\n\nEnter Kid Rock, who Anderson married in 2006. Surprising absolutely no one who has ever heard the fake-white-trash-rap-rocker-turned-fake-country star speak about literally anything, the union lasted all of four months, because Kid Rock is an asshole and an idiot to boot. I mean, seriously, listen to this.\n\nIn a biography excerpt published in Rolling Stone, Anderson describes how Borat, the character created by actor Sacha Baron Cohen, brought about the end of their marriage. In the movie Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Borat falls in love with CJ Parker, Anderson’s Baywatch character, and travels to the United States to find her.\n\nAnderson took Kid Rock—real name Bob Ritchie—to the movie’s premiere, where he was surprised to learn that Borat joked about Anderson’s sex tape with Tommy Lee. She wrote:\n\n“I didn’t tell Bob I was in the movie, because I wanted to surprise him. I forgot about the part in the film that referenced the ‘sex tape.’ Bob stormed out, calling me a whore and worse. He was embarrassed, and his reaction was not thought through.\n\n“After I chased Bob to his car, he peeled out, leaving me there alone. I turned back and apologized, then asked if anyone could give me a ride home. When I walked in, Bob was smashing a photo on the wall. He said he was sick of waking up to a picture of me and David LaChapelle every day. But it wasn’t me and David – it was Marilyn Monroe and Bert Stern.\n\n“We broke up. I didn’t stay in touch with Bob.”\n\nTalk about a crazy relationship."
