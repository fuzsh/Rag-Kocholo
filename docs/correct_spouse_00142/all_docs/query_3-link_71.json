        "text": "In 2006, Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson married in what seemed to be a suitable union.\n\nSince then, Kid has dedicated his life to Donald Trump, and Pamela seems to have a thing for Julian Assange, so poor life choices abound.\n\nThe duo’s marriage didn’t last very long, and of all the reasons that are probably running through your mind, I’m guessing you never thought of Borat.\n\nYes, Sacha Baron Cohen’s moustached, Kazakh creation that was the eponymous star of the 2006 hit, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.\n\nYou may recall that Pamela appears in the movie, so let’s get the basics out of the way with the help of the Daily Beast:\n\nThe climax of the film…centers around Borat Sagdiyev’s attempt to put the Baywatch star in a traditional marriage sack during a Virgin Megastore book signing and bring her back to Kazakhstan to be his wife.\n\nPamela doesn’t appear in the trailer, but she’s a central part of the movie’s plot. Over the years, she has hinted that she was in on the joke, and that’s now been confirmed by Baron Cohen during a recent live interview.\n\nAlso confirmed was Kid Rock’s reaction to the film, and how that played a direct result in the breakdown of the couple’s marriage;\n\nWhen the film was released in November 2006, Anderson had recently married rapper—and current Trump fanatic—Kid Rock. The pair filed for divorce just a few weeks later. At the time, tabloids reported that they screened the movie at the home of then-president of Universal Pictures Ron Meyer and when it was over Kid Rock “started screaming at Pam, saying she had humiliated herself and telling her, ‘You’re nothing but a whore! You’re a slut! How could you do that movie?’”\n\nBaron Cohen said that he texted Anderson after that screening and asked, “How did it go? What did he think?” She texted back that they were getting divorced. When he asked her why, she replied, “The movie.”\n\n“And I thought it was a joke but then a few weeks later they got divorced and they put as a reason for divorce, Borat,” Baron Cohen added, before joking, “I think they were a fantastic couple, so it’s a shame. Much better than Julian Assange or whoever she dated later on.”\n\nYet more confirmation that Kid Rock is a piece of garbage. I mean, he starred in the movie Joe Dirt, and also the music video for that time he butchered ‘Sweet Home Alabama’, so he really shouldn’t judge.\n\nNo wonder he looks so at home in the Oval Office:"
