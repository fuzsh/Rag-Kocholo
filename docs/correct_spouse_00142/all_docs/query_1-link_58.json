        "text": "Pamela Anderson is officially divorced from Rick Salomon.\n\nThe former \"Baywatch\" star and the poker player, both 47, finalized their messy divorce earlier this week and released a joint statement Wednesday, People reports.\n\n\"Public divorces can be harsh and cruel -- we apologize to our families and friends for any hurt and embarrassment we have caused -â€“ we have come to an amicable agreement and are moving on,\" the ex-couple said. \"There are private and personal family sensitivities to consider and we retract any hurtful comments made in haste and distaste. We wish each other and our families well.\"\n\nThe divorce proceedings took an ugly turn in March, when Anderson filed a restraining order claiming that Salomon was abusive and that she was \"scared of what he is capable of doing to me.\" In emails filed with the restraining order, Salomon allegedly called Anderson a \"serial baby killer to her husbands.\"\n\nAccording to TMZ, Salomon will pay the actress about $1 million in the divorce settlement. The pair first wed in 2007, only to have the marriage annulled two months later. They rekindled their romance and tied the knot again in January 2014. Anderson filed for divorce six months later, then petitioned to have the initial filing dismissed shortly thereafter.\n\nThe actress has two teenage sons from her first marriage to Tommy Lee, whom she was married to from 1995 to 1998. Her marriage to second husband Kid Rock lasted a few months in 2006."
