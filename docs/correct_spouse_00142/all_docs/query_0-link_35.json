        "text": "Pamela Anderson’s relationship with Kid Rock hit the skids because of her cameo appearance in the mockumentary “Borat,” she claims.\n\nAnderson, in her memoir “Love, Pamela,” shares the details on how she and ex-husband, Kid Rock, real name Robert “Bob” Ritchie.\n\nRock, according to Anderson, walked out of a screening of the film, starring Sacha Baron Cohen, at the home of entertainment executive Ron Meyer.\n\n“Lots of important industry people were there — Steven Spielberg, Rick Rubin, Laird Hamilton and his wife, Gabby Reece,” Anderson recounts in an exclusive excerpt published in Rolling Stone.\n\n“I didn’t tell Bob I was in the movie, because I wanted to surprise him,” she continues. “I forgot about the part in the film that referenced the ‘sex tape.’ Bob stormed out, calling me a whore and worse. He was embarrassed, and his reaction was not thought through.” When she chased him to the car, “he peeled out, leaving me there alone,” Anderson writes.\n\n“I turned back and apologized, then asked if anyone could give me a ride home,” she continues. “When I walked in, Bob was smashing a photo on the wall. He said he was sick of waking up to a picture of me and David LaChapelle every day. But it wasn’t me and David — it was Marilyn Monroe and Bert Stern.” Anderson adds, “We broke up. I didn’t stay in touch with Bob.”\n\nAnderson was married to Rock between 2006 and 2007."
