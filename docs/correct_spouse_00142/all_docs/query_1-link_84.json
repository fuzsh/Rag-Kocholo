        "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus' estranged wife, Australian singer Firerose, is firing back at the country singer in new court documents, accusing him of \"extreme\" abuse of various forms as part of their ongoing divorce.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus and Firerose married on Oct. 10, 2023.\n\nHe filed for divorce on May 23, 2024, citing irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. Cyrus is seeking an annulment on the grounds of fraud.\n\nCyrus was previously married to Cindy Smith and Tish Cyrus, whom he divorced in 2022.\n\nPeople has obtained Firerose's counter-filing from June 14, in which the 36-year-old singer accuses the 62-year-old musician of \"persistent\" drug use and several forms of domestic abuse.\n\n“Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse,” her attorneys allege in the new filing. “Wife was subjected to Husband’s persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.”\n\nFirerose — whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges — also reveals in the new documents that she was diagnosed with the BRCA1 gene mutation in 2020. She was slated to undergo a preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery on May 24, but alleges that Cyrus put her in an \"emotional and psychological prison\" in the days prior by launching \"verbal assaults\" against her.\n\n“When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a ‘selfish fu--ing bitch’ and continually alleged that she was using him,” her filing charges.\n\nRELATED: Billy Ray Cyrus Files for Restraining Order Against Estranged Wife Firerose\n\nFirerose says she left their home on May 23, the day before her scheduled surgery and the day Cyrus filed for divorce. She claims she postponed her surgery \"indefinitely\" because she had nowhere to live and was relying on Cyrus' health insurance and previous assurances that he would pay for her procedure.\n\nRepresentatives for Cyrus did not respond to People's request for comment, but Cyrus did provide British tabloid Page Six with a letter and a text that he alleges Firerose sent him, begging to reconcile just days after he filed for divorce.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Cyrus has filed an amendment to his divorce filing, alleging that Firerose was married before him and saying he would not have married her if he had known. He also accuses her of trying to deliberately isolate him from his family.\n\nFirerose denies inappropriate marital conduct in her response filing, claiming Cyrus' own conduct was so inappropriate that living with him was \"unsafe.\""
