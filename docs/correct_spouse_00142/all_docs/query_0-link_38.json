        "text": "Pamela Anderson has been married to five men, and all of her marriages ended in divorce. The former \"Baywatch\" star first wed Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee in 1995 and had two sons, Brandon and Dylan, with him before their split in 1998. She later exchanged vows with singer Bob Ritchie (aka Kid Rock to music fans), as well as pro poker player Rick Saloman (twice!), businessman Jon Peters, and most recently her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst, per Us Weekly.\n\nAnderson has been vocal about the fact that Lee, the father of her children, was the love of her life. In her 2023 memoir, \"Love, Pamela,\" she even wrote, \"My relationship with Tommy may have been the only time I was ever truly in love,\" according to People. In 2023, she told Interview that she still speaks to her first ex-husband on occasion despite the fact that he's now married to Brittany Furlan. \"It's always cordial and we ramble to each other sometimes and I can tell we miss each other's voice,\" Anderson said.\n\nBut there's one ex husband's voice Anderson doesn't seem to miss — and for a major reason.\n\nIn 2006, after five years of on-and-off dating, Pamela Anderson married singer Kid Rock in a trio of wedding ceremonies. The celebrity couple tied the knot on a yacht in St. Tropez, France, at a Beverly Hills courthouse, and at a bar in Nashville, all within a six-month period, per E! News. But, four months after their first vow exchange, Anderson filed for divorce. The exes did not keep in touch following their divorce, and it was one year later that Anderson ran into her former husband at the MTV Video Music Awards, which was held at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in September 2007.\n\n\"I saw Bob [Kid Rock] on the red carpet and he looked at me and said, 'Look what the cat dragged in,'\" Anderson wrote in her memoir, \"Love, Pamela\" (via Rolling Stone). Anderson revealed that her ex-husband, Tommy Lee, was also present at the awards ceremony, and later in the night the two men got into an altercation in the audience. \"Tommy and Bob dove at each other. Fists were flying, and the whole thing ended up on live TV,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2007, MTV reported that both Lee and Rock were escorted out of the Pearl Theater venue by security, and that Rock was cited for misdemeanor battery for punching Lee. Anderson was mortified by the incident. \"I walked out,\" she wrote in her memoir. And she hasn't spoken to Kid Rock since.\n\nPamela Anderson knew early on that her marriage to Kid Rock probably wouldn't last forever. Besides the fact that she considered Tommy Lee her soulmate, Anderson said the \"All Summer Long\" singer simply helped \"numb some of the pain\" she had following her divorce from the father of her children. In January 2023, Anderson told Sirius XM's Howard Stern that she knew things would never work out with Rock \"right when I got married,\" (via Entertainment Tonight). \"Tommy and I... had this incredible connection. But then you jump into something and it's like, 'Oh, it's not this incredible connection, it's just something else,'\" Anderson admitted. \"I just was going through the motions and then realizing... there's just nothing like I had with Tommy. ...Then I slowly try to find my way out.\"\n\nEven if Anderson had found true love with Rock, the former couple's differences would likely have driven them apart. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Anderson reiterated that she has not spoken to Rock at all since they divorced in 2007. She also noted he's nothing like the man she married. \"When he was with me, he didn't hunt,\" she said. \"I don't think he was very Republican, but now he is. Oh well.\""
