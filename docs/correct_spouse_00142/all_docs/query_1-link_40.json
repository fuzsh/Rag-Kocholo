        "text": "Jon Peters (1988-1991, 2019-2020)\n\nPamela Anderson originally met the A Star Is Born producer at the Playboy Mansion in the mid-1980s. They hit it off and started dating in 1988 and eventually moved in together in Los Angeles. They were reportedly together on and off from 1988 to 1991, with Peters even proposing to Anderson at one point. However, she turned Peters down due to their 22-year age difference and eventually split up for good in 1991.\n\nBut fast forward to 2020 and they ended up secretly marrying in a private ceremony in Malibu after a few months of dating. However, the marriage wasn’t legit since no marriage license was obtained and they called it off less than two weeks later, per CNN.\n\nRecently, it was announced that he will be leaving her $10 million in his will, per People.\n\nTommy Lee (1995-1998, 2008-2010)\n\nPamela Anderson and Tommy Lee had one of the most turbulent (and highly publicized) relationships of the 1990s, marrying each other in Feb 1995 after only knowing each other for four days. However, their whirlwind, fairytale-like romance began to crash down when their 1995 sex tape was released onto the internet. In an excerpt obtained by People, she wrote, “My relationship with Tommy may have been the only time I was ever truly in love.” She added that the sex tape was detrimental, adding, “It ruined lives, starting with our relationship…”\n\nShe later detailed the Mötley Crüe drummer’s jealousy issues. According to Anderson, he would trash her Baywatch trailer when he found out she had a love scene with former co-star David Chokachi, arrived on set in his Ferrari each day for “wife time,” and more. Anderson heartbreakingly wrote, “I thought that’s what love is.”\n\nThe pair later welcomed two sons named Brandon Thomas, born in 1996, and Dylan Jagger, born in 1997.\n\nAnderson and Lee broke it off after a terrifying incident where Lee ended up being arrested for spousal abuse in 1998. Anderson said she was holding 7-week-old Dylan in her arms while Brandon played nearby. She was watching both of them when Lee walked up to her and said “‘I want my wife back.'” She told him to “grow up” and give her “some f***ing help around here … It’s not about you anymore.”\n\nThe Baywatch star said he “ripped Brandon off me and threw me and Dylan into a wall.”\n\nShe filed for divorce the next day to “protect her babies,” and the divorce was finalized a year later.\n\nHowever, the two rekindled their romance in 2008, with Lee revealing that “Pamela and the kids have moved in with me.” He said, “It’s awesome, man. It’s definitely working. You can tell on the kids’ faces – they’re happy when we’re together.” They split again in 2010 for the final time.\n\nKelly Slater (1995, 1998-2000)\n\nSo, Pamela Anderson had a very complicated relationship with former co-star Kelly Slater. She said in her memoir, per Yahoo, “I met Kelly Slater on the set of Baywatch. He was my big love actually. He was such a sweetheart to me, and so good to me. I dated Kelly all the time. I mean, Kelly and I were together between lots of boyfriends and lots of girlfriends for him too, but it wasn’t just me.”\n\nAnd here’s the thing: she was dating Slater when she was exchanging vows with Lee. She said to Metro, “I was dating Kelly Slater at the time and I was supposed to go see him in Florida and meet his family. My first phone call was him to tell him I was married. He’s like, ‘What?!’ That was horrible.”\n\nLaurence Hallier (2005-2010)\n\nNot much is known about Pamela Anderson and real estate tycoon Laurence Hallier’s relationship, despite being together on and off for five years. However, we know a lot about their messy fallout, because it involved not one, but two lawsuits.\n\nAnderson claimed Hallier told her that if the development of the condos she planned on living in was delayed in any way, she would be given $1 million in cash. However, she never received said payment and sued so she could get that amount. Then, per Daily Mail, Hallier countersued for $22.5 million due to Anderson backing out on several appearances to publicize The Panorama Towers.\n\nIt was all settled for an unknown amount.\n\nRick Salomon (2007-2008, 2014)\n\nAfter her split from Kid Rock, Pamela Anderson went on to meet Paris Hilton’s ex-fling Rick Soloman, and there was an instant connection. They married in Oct 2007 at The Mirage in Las Vegas, but separated and annulled the marriage only two months after.\n\nHowever, Anderson and the poker player rekindled their romance almost exactly seven years later. They married again in Jan 2014 in Las Vegas, only to separate again less than a year later on Dec 13.\n\nAnderson previously told W Magazine how she truly felt about her second marriage to Soloman. “I look back at pictures of myself when I was in this awful relationship, and I looked 20 years older,” she said. “I know it sounds like a cliché, but happiness has a lot to do with beauty. Calm, peacefulness and not-constant stress are very, very important to feeling beautiful.”"
