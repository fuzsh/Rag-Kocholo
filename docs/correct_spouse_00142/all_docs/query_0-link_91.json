After an on-and-off romance from 2001 to '03, the couple rekindled their relationship in early July 2006. A few weeks later, they married in true rock-star style with Anderson in a white string bikini and Rock in a white T-shirt and baseball cap. But the whirlwind marriage came to a screeching halt in November 2006, when Rock and Anderson literally raced each other to the courthouse to file divorce papers. He beat her to it by 53 minutes."
