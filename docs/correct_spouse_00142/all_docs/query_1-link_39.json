        "text": "Jana Kramer married her longtime boyfriend, Allan Russell, in Scotland on Saturday (July 13). People reports that the couple wed in a small ceremony in front of just 35 guests — and in a nod to Russell's family lineage, the ceremony took place at Carnell Estate in Scotland, while the men in the wedding party all wore kilts.\n\nThe couple's guests included Kramer's two children from a previous marriage to former football player Mike Caussin: 8-year-old daughter Jolie and 5-year-old son Jace. Russell’s 16-year-old son, Troy, was also on hand, along with Kramer and Russell's 8-month-old son, Roman, who arrived in November of 2023.\n\nJace served as ring bearer, while Jolie served as flower girl and Troy was an usher.\n\n“I just knew that I wanted to marry him,\" Kramer tells People. \"We had talked about just going away and doing it ourselves, but it was important for me to have the wedding for Jolie and Jace, so they can see that we're married now.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Country Stars Who Got Engaged or Married in 2023\n\nThe couple shared their engagement news in May of 2023, and one month later, they announced Kramer's pregnancy.\n\nThe actor, country singer, author and podcaster has had a turbulent romantic history. Her first marriage to Michael Gambino lasted from 2004 until 2005, ending when he was arrested after choking her. He served six years in prison before dying by suicide.\n\nKramer's second marriage to actor Johnathon Schaech lasted just one month after they wed in 2010. They finalized their divorce in 2011, and her third marriage to Caussin lasted from 2015 until 2021. They went through several very public separations due to his repeated infidelity before they finally divorced.\n\n\"I've also never been so excited to walk down the aisle to someone, and it didn't need to be this big thing,\" Kramer told People prior to her wedding to Russell. \"It's going to be very small and intimate and everything that we wanted. We're getting married in Scotland, so the background is already stunning as it is. I just want to marry him, and I want my closest friends there. That's all that truly matters to us and our family.”\n\nRussell is a former pro soccer player and soccer coach. He and Karmer first met online after her divorce from Caussin, then began an international relationship, as he still lived in England at the time. They now live together in Nashville.\n\nThe couple are planning a three-week honeymoon in Italy."
