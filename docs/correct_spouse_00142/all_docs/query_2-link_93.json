        "text": "He proposed under the stars during a romantic rendezvous in a Nevada desert. Now, Kid Rock wants to give fiancée Pamela Anderson a white wedding extravaganza.\n\nKid Rock lifted the lid on the couple’s marriage plans during his visit to New York last week for Bette Midler’s “Hulaween Ball.”\n\nHe and Anderson, 35, will walk down the aisle mid-spring in a “traditional-type ceremony – complete with big white gown, great food, plenty of fancy decorations and lots of family and friends,” Kid Rock said.\n\nThe venue is yet to be finalized but probably will be close to their home in Detroit.\n\n“Pam and I are very excited. We are very much in love and very compatible – and we can’t wait to make all of us an official family,” he said.\n\nAnd in a further bombshell, Kid Rock insisted that once they’re married, he wants to raise Anderson’s two boys from her stormy marriage to wild rocker Tommy Lee as his own.\n\nKid Rock says he’s “infuriated” by some of Lee’s antics in the drawn-out battle with Anderson over the custody of sons Dylan, 4, and Brandon, 6.\n\nKid Rock, 31, wants to tell the judge in the case that he can be a far better dad to the boys than their biological father because of his experience in raising his own son, Robert Jr., 9, who has limited contact with his mother, Detroit autoworker Kelly South.\n\n“I’m a single parent. I’ve raised my son since he was 6 months old,” Kid Rock said. “Parenting Pam’s kids does not scare me in the least – I am qualified, and my heart is up to the task.”\n\nLee married Anderson in 1995 after a five-day courtship. She filed for divorce 19 months later, reconciled shortly after that, then filed for divorce again in February 1998.\n\nThe pair have battled in the courts for the last three years over custody of their two boys, but Kid Rock says Lee has gone too far in recent months by giving extensive media interviews to push his custody claims.\n\nLee, 40, has appeared in several television shows saying he is a changed man from his wild days as the frontman for Motley Crue. He has indicated he intends to fight for maximum custody of his sons.\n\nKid Rock labeled Lee’s TV appearances “a well-orchestrated publicity ploy to paint [himself] as the perfect parental role model and Pam as an unfit mother.”\n\n“He’s a great father when the cameras are rolling, and when they’re not, Lee is nowhere to be found,” Kid Rock said.\n\nA spokesperson for Lee yesterday rejected Kid Rock’s criticism and said Lee was “genuine” in all the promises he had made in regard to the raising of the boys."
