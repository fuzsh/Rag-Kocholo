His style alternates between rock, hip hop, country, and heavy metal. A self-taught musician, he plays every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\n\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast on Jive Records. His subsequent independent releases The Polyfuze Method and Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album Devil Without a Cause , which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, Cocky , were noted for blending elements of hip hop, country, rock and heavy metal. His most successful single from that period, \"Cowboy\" , is considered a pioneering song in the country rap genre. His best-selling singles overall are \"Picture\" and \"All Summer Long\" . Starting with his 2007 album Rock n Roll Jesus, his musical output has tended to be in the country and rock styles.\n\nEarly life\n\nKid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie in Romeo, Michigan, on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William Ritchie, who owned multiple car dealerships. He was raised in his father's 5,628-square-foot home on a 6-acre estate, where he regularly helped his family pick apples and care for their horses. His younger sister, Jill Ritchie, is an actress. In the 1980s, he became interested in hip hop, began to breakdance, and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around Detroit.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships\n\nKid Rock and former spouse Pamela Anderson in 2003\n\nIn eighth grade, Ritchie began an on-and-off relationship with classmate Kelley South Russell that lasted for the next decade. In summer 1993, Russell gave birth to his son, Robert James Ritchie Jr. They raised a total of three children together, but split up in late 1993 when Ritchie discovered that one of them was not his. He subsequently raised his son as a single father.\n\nIn 2000, Rolling Stone reported that Ritchie was dating model Jaime King. He began dating actress Pamela Anderson in 2001 and they became engaged in April 2002, but ended their relationship in 2003. They later reconciled and were married in July 2006. Three months later, on November 10, it was announced that Anderson, who had been pregnant with Ritchie's child, had miscarried. On November 27, she filed for divorce from Ritchie in Los Angeles County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences. Ritchie later claimed that the divorce was due to Anderson openly criticizing his mother and sister in front of his son.\n\nIn 2014, Ritchie became a grandfather when his son's girlfriend gave birth to a daughter. In November 2017, he became engaged to longtime girlfriend Audrey Berry.\n\nRitchie is an ordained minister and collects guns.\n\nPublic image\n\nKid Rock performs for service members during an USO tour at Al Asad Airbase's Jordan-Hare Stadium in Iraq, 2008\n\nIn 1989, Ritchie became a shareholder of the independent record label Top Dog Records, formed by Alvin Williams and Earl Blunt of EB-Bran Productions, in 1988; Ritchie's investment in the company gave him 25% ownership. In 2001, he filed a lawsuit to gain full control over the Top Dog record label, resulting in his receiving full ownership of the label in 2003. Ritchie also founded Kid Rock's Made in Detroit restaurant and bar, which specializes in Southern-style cuisine.\n\nIn 2002, Ritchie performed alongside Chuck D and Grandmaster Flash in tribute to slain DJ Jam Master Jay. His performance at the Super Bowl XXXVIII, in 2004, drew criticism from Veterans of Foreign Wars and Senator Zell Miller for wearing the American flag with one slit in the middle, as a poncho; Ritchie was accused of \"desecrating\" the flag.\n\nIn January 2005, Ritchie performed at the inaugural address of reelected president George W. Bush, sparking criticism from conservative groups, due to Ritchie's lyrics. In September, Kid Rock filled in for Johnny Van Zant, the lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd, on the band's hit \"Sweet Home Alabama\" at the Hurricane Katrina benefit concert. In 2007 and 2008, Ritchie toured for the United Service Organizations. Also in 2008, Ritchie recorded and made a music video for the song \"Warrior\" for a National Guard advertising campaign.\n\nA philanthropist, Ritchie oversees The Kid Rock Foundation, a charity which raises funds for multiple causes, including campaigns which sent \"Kid Rock care packages\" to U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. Ritchie is an advocate for affordable concert tickets, and makes an effort to try and sell tickets to his performances for as low as possible to encourage increased concert attendance for lower income consumers and discourage scalping. Instead of getting paid for the show, he gets a percentage of concession and ticket sales.\n\nIn 2011, Ritchie was honored by the NAACP, which sparked protests stemming from his past display of the Confederate flag in his concerts. During the ceremony, Kid Rock elaborated on his display of the flag, stating, \" never flew the flag with hate in my heart I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people.\" Ritchie's publicist announced that 2011 was the year he officially distanced himself from the flag. In 2012, Kid Rock performed alongside Travie McCoy and The Roots in honor of the Beastie Boys, during the band's induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In 2013, Ritchie criticized Republican lawmakers in New York for passing laws which made it difficult for him to keep concert ticket prices low.\n\nIn January 2015, Ritchie was criticized by fans for appearing in a photograph holding up a dead cougar that was killed on a hunting trip with Ted Nugent. In 2015, following the Charleston church shooting, the Michigan chapter of the National Action Network protested outside of the Detroit Historical Museum which honored Ritchie; activists urged Ritchie to renounce the Confederate flag, which he had displayed in concerts from 2001 to 2006. Ritchie wrote an email to Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly, stating, \"Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass\". The same day, the National Action Network protested Chevrolet for sponsoring Ritchie's tour. In September 2016, Ritchie was criticized for allegedly saying \"Man, fuck Colin Kaepernick.\" during a live performance of his song \"Born Free\".\n\nIn November 2017, Ritchie fired his publicist, Kirt Webster, after Webster was accused of sexual misconduct. On April 6, 2018, Ritchie was inducted into the Celebrity Wing of the WWE Hall of Fame during the weekend of Wrestlemania 34.\n\nOn November 30, 2019, Ritchie drew controversy after he was recorded making a series of inappropriate statements while intoxicated at his restaurant in Nashville, including rude comments about Oprah Winfrey. After receiving major pushback for his comments, Ritchie decided to close the Detroit branch of his restaurant in December 2019, located at the Little Caesar's Arena. When asked for comment about the closure, he stated that \"it's wise to go where you're celebrated, not tolerated\".\n\nPolitics and views\n\nRitchie is a supporter of the Republican Party, although he has routinely proclaimed himself as libertarian philosophically, stating he has socially liberal views on topics like abortion and gay marriage but conservative views on economics. Ritchie has advocated legalizing and taxing marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He has also stated, \"I don't think crazy people should have guns.\" He was a vocal supporter of American military involvement in the Iraq War. Ritchie has met with presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump while they were in office. Regarding his political views, Ritchie said, \"I have friends everywhere. Democrat, Republican, this that and the other. We're all human beings first, Americans second. Let's find some common ground and get along.\" However, during his speech at the 2018 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he stated that he wanted to \"body slam some Democrats\".\n\nRitchie supported Bill Clinton and George W. Bush during their presidencies. In 2008, Ritchie supported newly elected President Barack Obama, saying that the president's election was \"a great thing for black people.\" In 2012, Ritchie campaigned for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney; the candidate used Ritchie's song \"Born Free\" as his campaign theme. In 2015, Ritchie publicly endorsed Ben Carson for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. In February 2016, he voiced approval for Donald Trump's campaign for the same office. In September, Kid Rock was criticized for allegedly saying \"fuck Colin Kaepernick\" during a live performance at Fenway Park of his song \"Born Free\". In December, Kid Rock sparked controversy for selling vulgar T-shirts supporting Trump at concerts, including one showing a map of the United States which labelled the states which had voted against Trump as \"Dumbfuckistan\".\n\nOn July 12, 2017, Ritchie shared a photo of a \"Kid Rock for US Senate\" yard sign on Twitter. He also launched a website at kidrockforsenate.com, which sold merchandise bearing that inscription. Several weeks later, he wrote a post on his blog stating that he was still \"exploring my candidacy\", and that, whether or not he ran, he wanted to register people to vote, because \"although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it.\" He added that he wanted \"to help working class people in Michigan and America all while still calling out these jackass lawyers who call themselves politicians.\" His statements sparked media speculation that he would try to run on the Republican ticket against sitting Michigan senator Debbie Stabenow, as well as enthusiasm from some prominent Republicans, including former New York Governor George Pataki, who wrote on Twitter, \"Kid Rock is exactly the kind of candidate the GOP needs right now.\" In an October 2017 interview with Howard Stern, Ritchie put an end to the speculation, saying that he had never intended to run for Senate, adding rhetorically, \"Who couldn't figure that out?\". He later clarified that the campaign was a joke that he had started after a Michigan state legislator encouraged him to run for Senate. He expressed surprise at the interest his potential candidacy had received, but also disappointment that some opposed to his candidacy had brought up his previous use of the Confederate flag to label him a racist. He donated the $122,000 he had raised by selling \"Kid Rock for U.S. Senate\" merchandise to a voter registration group.\n\nLegal issues\n\nIn both March 1991 and September 1997, Ritchie faced misdemeanor charges stemming from alcohol-related arrests in Michigan.\n\nIn 2005, Ritchie was charged with assaulting a DJ in a strip club.\n\nIn 2006, California pornographic film company Red Light District attempted to distribute a 1999 sex tape in which Kid Rock and Scott Stapp, lead singer of the band Creed, are seen partying and receiving oral sex from groupies; both Rock and Stapp filed with the California courts to sue the pornographers to stop the tape's distribution.\n\nAt the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, Ritchie got into a fistfight with MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e drummer Tommy Lee, another ex of Anderson's, and was charged with assault. A month later, he was arrested and charged with battery after fighting with a Waffle House customer. He pleaded no contest to one count and was fined $1,000, as well as being required to perform 80 hours of community service and complete a six-hour anger management course.\n\nncG1vNJzZmion6W7oq7LnmWcp51kwrStjpqpraGjqcBwfZhvcG9lm56xbr7OnKJompmktLOtz6GwZpmemXqnrcKtqg%3D%3D"
