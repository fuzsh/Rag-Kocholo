        "text": "Baywatch icon Pamela Anderson has married for the fifth time.\n\nThe actress, 52, is now wed to her fifth husband, 74-year-old movie producer Jon Peters.\n\nThe pair previously dated when she was 19, but she has since had romances with musicians Kid Rock and Tommy Lee.\n\nShe also developed a close friendship with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and smuggled food into the Ecuadorian embassy for him.\n\nPammi split from 34-year-old beau Adil Rami last year, writing on Instagram : \"He used to joke about other players who had girlfriends down the street in apartments close to their wives.\n\n\"He called those men ­monsters. He is the monster.\"\n\nHowever, new hubby Jon has quite the colourful history himself.\n\nThe Beverly Hills native played a child riding a donkey in the 1956 biblical epic The Ten Commandments before going on to drop out of school at 13 and wind up in a detention centre.\n\nHe then fled two male guardians he had in New York and was homeless for a time.\n\nJon eventually got a job as a \"muff dyer\" for sex workers, where he told The Hollywood Reporter in 2017: \"The prostitutes had red hair, red pubic hair and red poodles. I made it so everything matched.\"\n\nSimilarly to Pamela, Jon has been through four marriages.\n\nFirst, Jon married before the age of 17 to Henrietta Zampitella, and then to Hollywood actress Lesley Ann Warren , with whom he has a son named Christopher.\n\nJoining his family in their trade of hairdressing salons, he opened one on LA's Rodeo Drive and pretended to cut the hair of big stars when speaking to the newspapers so that they would attract further big names.\n\nDuring his marriage to Lesley, Jon had a stormy 12-year romance with living legend Barbra Streisand after he did the wigs for her film For Pete's Sake.\n\nHe fuelled her movie career with roles in films such as A Star Is Born, which won Barbra a Golden Globe and an Oscar for Best Original Song for the film's lead single, Evergreen.\n\nJon split from Lesley in 1974, but Barbra went on to become the godmother to Jon's daughter Caleigh.\n\nHe said of Barbra to THR : \"She was the most captivating, interesting, creative person I ever met. I will always owe her for giving me the life I've had.\"\n\nAfter a romance with his married Batman leading lady Kim Basinger, Jon met Pammi at the Playboy Mansion in 1989.\n\nHe said to The Hollywood Reporter : \"I walked in and saw this little angel sitting at the bar. It was Pammi. She was like 19. I knew she would be a big star.\"\n\nThe then-41-year-old producer dated and cohabited with Pammi and paid for her performing arts classes.\n\nHe went on to propose to the beauty but she turned him down.\n\nJon told her at the time: \"In 30 years, our age difference won’t mean so much.\"\n\nIn 1991, Jon was axed from Sony allegedly due to excessive spending on extravagant and hedonistic outings, according to the book Hit & Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1992, Pamela was catapulted to global stardom in Baywatch, going on to marry musician Tommy Lee and having two sons.\n\nDuring the abusive marriage, which saw Lee beat Pamela, Jon was there for her.\n\nHe revealed: \"I picked her up many times from her lawyer’s office and flew her up with her kids and hid her out in Aspen for a month because the guy was beating her up.\"\n\nJon had three more daughters and two more failed marriages, with fourth wife Mindy Williamson being granted a restraining order against him in 2003.\n\nHe also developed a painkiller addiction followed by a marijuana habit.\n\n\"I blew out my knee, so 10 years ago when I went through my divorce [from Kendyl's mother, Mindy Williamson], I got hooked on Vicodin,\" he told THR in 2017.\n\nSuccess beckoned again in the form of another DC Comics superhero: Superman.\n\nRelaunching the movies put Jon back into big money, with Superman Returns earning $391 million worldwide and him claiming to have taken home $80 million to $85 million for Superman Returns and Man of Steel combined.\n\nThis was followed by a huge lawsuit by his ex personal assistant Shelly Morita who accused him of sexual harassment and exposing himself in front of her two-year-old daughter.\n\nDespite Peters denying the accusations, he was forced to pay damages of more than £2.5 million, according to The Sun.\n\nJezebel reports that Morita was one of five women who sued Peters for sexual harassment, accusations to which he denies any wrongdoing.\n\nSince 2013, Jon has lived a life of seclusion on his 3,000 acre ranch in Santa Barbara, with a regular routine of early rises and early nights broken up with playing the stock market and dining with friends such as Jack Nicholson.\n\n\"Everybody's reclusive when you make a certain amount of money,\" he told THR .\n\nHowever, it seems he always had one constant in mind for his life the last few decades.\n\nSpeaking after his wedding to Pamela, Jon said: \"Pamela has never seen her full potential as an artist. She has yet to shine in a real way.\n\n\"There is much more to her than meets the eye, or I wouldn't love her so much.\n\n\"There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but - for 35 years - I've only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild - in a good way.\n\n\"She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated.\"\n\nThe pair wed on Tuesday in front of her sons Brandon, 23, and Dylan, 22, by Tommy Lee and also Jon's children and his third wife, Christine Peters.\n\nPamela shared a poem with THR following the ceremony: \"Jon is the original 'bad boy' of Hollywood -\n\nno one compares -\n\nI love him deeply like family.\n\nHis life used to scare me.\n\nSo much for a girl like me.\n\nNow I've seen more of life\n\nand realize...\n\nHe's been there all along.\n\nNever failed me -\n\nI'm ready now\n\nand\n\nhe's ready too -\n\nWe\n\nunderstand\n\nand respect each other -\n\nWe love each other\n\nwithout conditions -\n\nI'm a lucky woman -\n\nProof\n\nGod has a plan.\"\n\nIt seems Pamela has really found happiness with the self-styled \"Trump of Hollywood\"."
