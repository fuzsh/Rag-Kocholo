        "text": "Pamela Anderson has opened up about her ex-husband Kid Rock‘s alleged nasty reaction to her role in Borat.\n\nThe former Baywatch star has released a new memoir, which makes several claims about many people from her past, including Tim Allen.\n\nIn Love, Pamela, which is out now, Anderson claims that musician Kid Rock – real name Robert James Ritchie – had no idea she was in the 2006 movie as she wanted her cameo to be a surprise when they watched it together at the premiere.\n\n“I didn’t tell Bob I was in the movie because I wanted to surprise him,” Rolling Stone reports Anderson as writing.\n\nAccording to the 55-year-old actor, who was married to the singer for one year, she “forgot about the part in the scene that referenced her “sex tape” with previous husband, Tommy Lee.\n\nShe alleges that this reference did not go down well with Kid Rock, who “stormed out, calling me a wh*** and worse”.\n\n“He was embarrassed, and his reaction was not thought through,” Anderson wrote, claiming that he left her at the premiere alone.\n\n“I turned back and apologised, then asked if anyone could give me a ride home,” she said. She claims that when she got home, Kid Rock was “smashing a photo on the wall”.\n\nIn the film, Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) is obsessed with Anderson and approaches the actor at a book signing with a “traditional marriage sack” that he seemingly attempts to put her into against her will. The scene, unlike many others in the film, was staged.\n\nBaron Cohen previously told The Daily Beast that the scene led to the couple’s divorce.,\n\nHe claimed that, after asking Anderson what Kid Rock had thought of her appearance, “She texted back, ‘He’s getting divorced.’”\n\n“I was like, ‘Why?’ And she goes, ‘The movie.’ And I thought it was a joke.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted Kid Rock for comment.\n\nAnderson, who has been married six times, has opened up about her past relationships while promoting the new book.\n\nShe explained her decision to marry so many times, referring to each one as failed attempts to “recreate a family” for her two sons,\n\nAnderson suggested that most of her exes “treated her badly”, telling The Times: “I also would not allow anyone to abuse me and didn’t want my kids to think it was OK. And so that was always my red line.”\n\nHowever, she named Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner as the one man she thinks treated her with “complete and utter respect”.\n\nFollowing Hefner’s death in 2017, Anderson paid tribute, call him her “friend and mentor”.\n\nIt was at Hefner’s Playboy mansion in the 1980s that Anderson met film producer Jon Peters, who she went on to marry for just 12 days in 2008.\n\nDespite their short-lived romance, Peters recently revealed he has left her an eye-watering sum in his will.\n\nLove, Pamela is out now, as is Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story.
