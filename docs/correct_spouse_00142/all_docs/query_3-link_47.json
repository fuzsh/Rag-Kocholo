        "text": "While promoting his new album \"Rebel Soul\" on Howard Stern's radio show on Wednesday, Kid Rock opened up about his short-lived marriage to Pamela Anderson.\n\nRock described the relationship bluntly: “Getting married kicks ass, being married sucks.\"\n\nThe Detroit rocker said that Bob Jr., his son with ex-girlfriend Kelley South Russell, encouraged him to call it quits with Anderson.\n\n“[The relationship] started to affect my son, when it started to affect my son, I was like ‘I’m out.' It took me a minute, but thank God I did.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnderson filed for divorce from Rock in November 2006, after just four months of marriage. A month before they split, Anderson reportedly had a miscarriage, but Rock later claimed she had lied about losing the baby to get a rise out of him during an argument. Their divorce was finalized in February 2007.\n\nAnderson and Rock's marriage may have only lasted a few months, but theirs is hardly the shortest celebrity marriage we've seen.
