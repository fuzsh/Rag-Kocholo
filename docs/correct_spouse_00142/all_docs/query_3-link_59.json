        "text": "Pamela Anderson loves love. Throughout the years, the \"Baywatch\" star and former Playboy model has romanced her fair share of suitors and tied the knot with five men — including repeat marriages with Rick Salomon. \"I'm a hopeless romantic and I do believe in [love] . . . I love traditional marriage,\" Anderson once said on \"The Wendy Williams Show\" in 2016.\n\nAnderson's most notable relationship was with Tommy Lee, her first husband, with whom she shares her two sons Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 25. Anderson and Lee's relationship came back into the spotlight in 2022 as the subject of Hulu's \"Pam & Tommy\" series, which focused on their infamous leaked sex tape. Anderson denounced the show for not consulting her prior, however, she did tell her side of the story in her candid 2023 Netflix documentary, \"Pamela, a Love Story\" — part of which revisits her and Lee's relationship and their tumultuous split.\n\nIn the documentary, Anderson gets emotional when discussing her marriage with Lee, revealing that she never truly got over their breakup and that she has some regret about not being with the father of her children. \"Even though I thought I could re-create a family, or fall in love with someone else, it's just not me,\" she says. \"So I think that's probably why I keep failing in all my relationships . . . I think I'd rather be alone than not be with the father of my kids.\"\n\nIn 2023, Anderson regularly attended events with her and Lee's sons. The trio hit the \"Pamela, A Love Story\" premiere together back in January, and they were last photographed at New York Fashion Week in September.\n\nKeep reading ahead for Anderson's entire marriage history."
