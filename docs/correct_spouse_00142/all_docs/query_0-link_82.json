        "text": "LOS ANGELES - She was once Pamela Anderson Lee. Now actress Pamela Anderson is Mrs. Kid Rock.\n\nThe former \"Baywatch\" babe wed the rock star Saturday in St. Tropez, Anderson's spokeswoman, Ann Gurrola, told The Associated Press. She said more details on the wedding would be available Monday.\n\nAnderson, 39, and Kid Rock, 35, were engaged in Las Vegas in 2002 but split up the following year.\n\nThe two were photographed together earlier this month in St. Tropez, and two weeks ago, Anderson wrote in her online diary that she was \"in love\" and planning to marry again.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" she wrote. \"I see the light. Sounds dramatic but it's true.\"\n\nShe also seemed to allude to her on-again-off-again relationship with Kid Rock when she wrote, \"I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle.\n\n\"Well my miracle came and went. And came back and back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing,\" she said.\n\nAnderson and her first husband, rock star Tommy Lee, divorced in 1998 after three years of marriage. They have two sons, Brandon, 10, and Dylan, 8.\n\nKid Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, has a 13-year-old son, Bob Jr."
