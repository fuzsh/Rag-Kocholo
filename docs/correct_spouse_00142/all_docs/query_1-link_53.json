        "text": "Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum: 2018\n\nDewan and Tatum first met in 2006 on the set of their dance flick Step Up. The couple then tied the knot in 2009, and welcomed their daughter, Everly, in 2013. In April 2018, they released a statement announcing their divorce after nearly nine years of marriage.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux: 2018\n\nThe two actors first met in 2007 while on the set of Tropic Thunder and, soon after, reunited on the 2011 set of Wanderlust. Afterwards, they began dating, and went on to get engaged in 2012. Aniston and Theroux enjoyed a long engagement, but eventually tied the knot in 2015 at a private ceremony in Bel Air. After two and a half years of marriage, they announced their separation in February of 2018.\n\nUsher and Grace Miguel: 2018\n\nThe singer and Miguel started dating in 2009, shortly following Usher's previous divorce from first wife, Tameka Foster. He proposed to Miguel in 2015. Following almost 10 years together, and two and a half years of marriage, the couple eventually separated in March 2018.\n\nJohnny Depp and Amber Heard: 2017\n\nDepp and Heard met on the set of The Rum Diary in 2011. They began dating in 2014 after Depp separated with longtime girlfriend Vanessa Paradis. They became engaged the same year, and were married in the Bahamas in 2015. In May 2016, Heard filed for a restraining order and a divorce, citing physical and verbal abuse. Their divorce was finalized on January 13, 2017. Heard received a $7 million settlement, all of which she donated to charities supporting victims of domestic violence.\n\nBen Stiller and Christine Taylor: 2017\n\nThe two actors met in 1999 on the set of a television series and they fell fast. They married the following year on May 13, 2000 in Kauai. After 17 years and two kids, they seemed destined to last. However, on May 25, 2017, they sadly announced their divorce. However, this is one split that didn't stick, and in an interview with Esquire published in February 2022, the Zoolander actor shared that he and Taylor were back together after they decided to move back in with each other at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nChris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow: 2016\n\nGwyneth Paltrow famously referred to their divorce as a “conscious uncoupling.” After ten years of marriage and two children, they divorced on July 14, 2016. Distance and grueling work schedules were cited as factors in the split.\n\nKaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting: 2016\n\nThe Big Bang Theory star married the tennis pro after six months of dating in 2013. The marriage lasted 21 months. They divorced on May 6, 2016. Kaley Cuoco later revealed that Ryan Sweeting had become addicted to prescription painkillers and was making no effort to get sober, leading to the demise of their union.\n\nKris and Caitlyn Jenner: 2015\n\nAfter marrying in 1991, the couple added two children of their own to their brood of eight children from their previous marriages. They separated on June 1, 2013 and their divorce was finalized on March 23, 2015. Following the divorce, Caitlyn began her public transition from life as Bruce to life as Caitlyn.\n\nJennifer Garner and Ben Affleck: 2015\n\nWith ten years of marriage and three children, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner seemed destined to last. They met on the set of Pearl Harbor in 2000 and became romantically involved in 2004 after both had split from their previous partners. They married in a destination wedding in Turks and Caicos in 2005. They divorced in 2015 amid rumors of Affleck having an affair with the couple's nanny.\n\nMiranda Lambert and Blake Shelton: 2015\n\nThey met in 2005 when they performed a duet together at a concert for Country Music Television. Blake Shelton was still married to his first wife Kaynette Gern at the time, and they didn't begin dating until after his divorce in 2006. They had no children, but they did have 15 rescue pets. Toward the end of their ten year union, rumors of infidelity on both sides. Their divorce was finalized in 2015.\n\nHeidi Klum and Seal: 2014\n\nThe supermodel and singer wed in Mexico in 2005, and romantically renewed their vows yearly on their anniversary. They had three children during their nearly ten-year marriage. They divorced in 2014, as rumors swirled that Seal partied hard and had a problem controlling his temper, while Seal accused Heidi Klum of having an affair with her bodyguard.\n\nMariah Carey and Nick Cannon: 2014\n\nMariah Carey began dating Nick Cannon in 2008, and they got married the same year in a secret ceremony in the Bahamas. They welcomed twins Moroccan and Monroe on April 30, 2011. In the years to come, however, they grew apart and ended up divorcing December of 2014.\n\nHeather Mills and Paul McCartney: 2008\n\nAfter six years of marriage, Sir Paul split from Mills and it sure wasn’t pretty. They fought a very public battle in the tabloids, and she ended up with around $48.6 million after having requested nearly five times that amount.\n\nGuy Ritchie and Madonna: 2008\n\nThe Material Girl married director Ritchie in 2000, and they broke up nearly eight years later. They share a son, Rocco, and reportedly split because, as Madonna said in 2012, the marriage “[wasn’t] what I thought it was going to be.”\n\nRyan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon: 2007\n\nIf you’ve ever seen the movie Cruel Intentions, you will realize why this sudden divorce was particularly devastating. Sweethearts Phillippe and Witherspoon met when they were in their early 20s and married shortly thereafter.
