I gave him my number.\"\n\nTommy, 59, pursued Pamela for two months following their initial meeting, and the rocker even flew to Cancun to find the actress, who was staying at the Ritz-Carlton for a photoshoot.\n\nDespite it being the second time they'd ever met, the pair partied for 72 hours before Tommy spontaneously popped the question.\n\nOn 19 February 1995, Pamela and Tommy exchanged vows on the beach, both barefoot and wearing swimwear.\n\nHowever drama soon followed, and later that same month a sex tape was stolen from the couple's Malibu home, which they were unaware of until it was reported in the media.\n\nThe tape was uploaded to Club Love, a pornography subscription website, and it was also made into VHS and DVD copies. The tape reportedly raked in $77million (£56million) in a year, with neither Pamela or Tommy receiving a penny.\n\nIn 2002, the pair received $740,000 (£545,000) each having been awarded a default judgement in their 1998 copyright infringement and invasion-of-privacy lawsuits.\n\nIn 1996, Pamela gave birth to the couple's first child, a son named Brandon Thomas Lee, now 25, before welcoming their second son in 1997, Dylan Jagger Lee, 24.\n\nHowever just a year after welcoming their second child, Pamela filed for divorce from the drummer and it was eventually finalised in May 1998.\n\nTommy and Pamela have had an on and off relationship ever since, having allegedly rekindled in 1999 and then giving their romance once last chance in 2008.\n\nThey stayed together until 2010, before announcing that their relationship was over for good.\n\nKid Rock\n\nAfter splitting from the \"love of her life\" Tommy, Pamela got engaged to model Marcus Schenkenberg in 1998, but she called it quits in 2001.\n\nShe soon met Kid Rock, real name Robert James Ritchie, and the pair sparked up a romance.\n\nIn April 2002, Pamela and Kid Rock announced their engagement, but a year later they ended their relationship.\n\nHaving reconciled, the couple went on to tie the knot in July 2006, but their marital happiness was short-lived.\n\nJust four months after exchanging vows, Pamela filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIt was also revealed that the actress had been pregnant with Kid Rock's child, but had miscarried not long before filing for divorce.\n\nRick Salomon\n\nIn October 2007, Pamela married poker player Rick Salomon, at The Mirage in Las Vegas.\n\nTwo months later, the couple sought an annulment which was finalised at the start of 2008.\n\nPamela went on to reunite with Tommy Lee one final time that same year, but after their called it quits in 2010, she and Rick got back in touch.\n\nIn 2013, Rick and Pamela gave their romance one more chance, and the pair got married again in January 2014.\n\nPamela soon filed for another divorce from the poker player, but they decided to attempt to work through their marital issues.\n\nNevertheless, the couple's second divorce was eventually finalised in April 2015.\n\nJon Peters\n\nHaving first met back in the 1980s, Pamela and Jon Peters had been good pals for many years.\n\nJon had proposed to Pamela back when they first met, but she turned him down due to their 22 year age gap.\n\nDecades passed, but Jon and Pamela eventually rekindled their romance. The Baywatch star clearly had a change of heart, and she married Jon in January 2020 in Malibu.\n\nTwo weeks later it was revealed that the newlyweds had called it quits, and reports began circulating claiming that the couple had never obtained a legal marriage certificate in the first place, so technically Pamela wasn't heading for another divorce.\n\nIn a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter, Pamela said: “I have been moved by the warm reception to Jon and my union. \"We would be very grateful for your support as we take some time apart to re-evaluate what we want from life and from one another.\n\n\"Life is a journey and love is a process. With that universal truth in mind, we have mutually decided to put off the formalisation of our marriage certificate and put our faith in the process. Thank you for respecting our privacy.\"\n\nPamela and Jon's split wasn't completely amicable however, and Jon told the New York Post that he'd \"dropped everything for Pam\", while claiming that he'd paid all of her debts shortly before they split.\n\nDan Hayhurst\n\nIn 2020, Pamela began dating her bodyguard, Dan Hayhurst.\n\nThe pair's relationship went from strength to strength, and they tied the knot in a secret ceremony on Christmas Eve in Vancouver.\n\nPamela and Dan moved in together in Canada, where the actress originally hails from, and Pamela appeared smitten with her new husband, with couple completing TV interviews together.\n\nThe star told the Daily Mail at the time: “I’m exactly where I need to be — in the arms of a man who truly loves me.”\n\nHowever, in January 2021 it was revealed that the pair's whirlwind romance had reportedly come to an end, and Pamela has allegedly filed for divorce.\n\nShe is now said to be residing in Malibu with her two sons, Brandon and Dylan."
