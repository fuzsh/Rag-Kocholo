Pamela Anderson is getting married again to her former fiancé, Kid Rock.

In a note on her Web site posted Tuesday, Anderson did not specifically name Rock, but wrote "Yes. I'm finally getting remarried ... it's been a whirlwind ... spontaneous but well thought through."

Us Weekly reports on its Web site that Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, and Anderson will be getting married on July 29 on a yacht off Saint-Tropez.

A rep for Anderson told the magazine, "They've been close for a very long time and decided that now is the right time to take the next step. They couldn't be happier about their future together."

Anderson was married to Motley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee on Feb. 19, 1995, and divorced Feb. 28, 1998. They have two children Brandon and Dylan.

Anderson said on her Web site that she's in love and happy and feels like she's "finally free."

"I've raised my kids alone in hope of a miracle," she said. "Well my miracle came and went. And came back and came back because he knew that I'd wake up one day and realize that I was waiting for nothing."

Anderson said that her children are prepared for the marriage. "They know the truth and they are strong, smart kids," she said. "They love their dad. They love their new Step Dad who they've known for years."

She cryptically added, "Wounds will heal. Some people may never grow up. Actions speak louder than words ... watch!"

The former "Baywatch" actress was engaged to model Marcus Schenkenberg, but they broke it off in 2001. Later she was engaged to Kid Rock, but they ended their relationship in 2003.
