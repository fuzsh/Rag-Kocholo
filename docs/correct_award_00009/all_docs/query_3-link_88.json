        "text": "The three laureates are recognised for having “demonstrated a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to measure the rapid processes in which electrons move or change energy”, said the 2023 Nobel committee for Physics. “The laureates’ contributions have enabled the investigation of processes that are so rapid they were previously impossible to follow.”\n\nPierre Agostini is French, he was a researcher at CEA Saclay from 1968 to 2002 and is currently an Emeritus Professor at Ohio State University (USA). Ferenc Krausz is an Hungarian-Austrian physicist, Director at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics, Garching (Germany), and Professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (Munich) .\n\nThe Franco-Swedish physicist Anne L’Huillier was a researcher at the Service for the Physics of Atoms and Surfaces, today known as LIDYL, at CEA Saclay from 1982 to 1995. She is currently a Professor of Atomic Physics at Lund University (Sweden) – a member university of the EUGLOH Alliance*. She is also a member of the Governing Board at the Institut d’Optique Graduate School at Université Paris-Saclay. She also works closely with certain laboratories such as LIDYL. Convinced by her exemplary career and scientific achievements which have been recognised by numerous awards, Université Paris-Saclay decided six months ago to bestow her with the honorary title of Doctor Honoris Causa. Anne L’Huillier graciously accepted the university’s proposal, honouring the university’s academic community and in particular our colleagues and students working in Physics. She will be awarded the title on 13 November."
