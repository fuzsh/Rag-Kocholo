        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nPhilipp Lenard / Nobel 05\n\nPHILIPP EDUARD ANTON LENARD German physicist\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 4381449\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10076129\n\n1862 1947 Anton Eduard Nobel Oval Philipp Physicist Signature\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis photograph captures the enigmatic presence of Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard, the esteemed German physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905. Lenard's intense gaze and meticulously groomed appearance are evident in this oval portrait, taken in the later years of his life, around 1947. The physicist is dressed in a formal suit, the lapels of which are crisply pressed, and his signature mustache and beard frame his distinguished face. Born on July 7, 1862, in Szeged, Hungary, Lenard made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of cathode rays and the photoelectric effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1905, sharing it with fellow laureates Mariette Curie and Henri Becquerel for their work on radioactivity. Lenard's research on cathode rays led to the development of the electron microscope, a crucial tool in modern science. Despite his groundbreaking discoveries, Lenard's later years were marked by controversy. He was a vocal supporter of Nazi ideology and was a member of the Nazi Party from 1933 until the end of World War II. This dark chapter in Lenard's life casts a shadow over his otherwise impressive scientific legacy. This historical photograph, with its intricate details and rich history, is a testament to the complexities of the human experience and the enduring impact of scientific discovery. The paper on which it is printed bears the weight of time, adding to its authenticity and allure. This image is not only a valuable addition to any collection of historical photographs but also a poignant reminder of the complexities of the human story.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
