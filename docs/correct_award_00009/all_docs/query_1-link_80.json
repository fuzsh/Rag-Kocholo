        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nPhilipp Lenard / Photo\n\nPHILIPP EDUARD ANTON LENARD German physicist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 623430\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10062976\n\n1862 1947 Anton Eduard Nobel Philipp Physicist Physics Prize\n\nFEATURES IN THESE COLLECTIONS\n\n> Europe > Germany > Posters\n\n> Europe > Germany > Related Images\n\n> Popular Themes > Physicists\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nIn this historic photograph, Nobel Laureate Philipp Eduard Anton Lenard is seen in formal attire, proudly holding the prestigious Nobel Prize he received in 1905. Lenard, born on February 7, 1862 in Budapest, Hungary, was a German physicist who made significant contributions to the fields of cathode rays, photoelectric effect, and vacuum tubes. Lenard's groundbreaking work on cathode rays earned him international recognition, and in 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing it with fellow physicist Pieter Zeeman. Lenard's research on the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated that light could be described as both a particle and a wave, was instrumental in the development of quantum theory. The photograph captures Lenard in his prime, with a distinguished beard and a serious expression. He is dressed in a dark suit and tie, adding to the formal and historic feel of the image. The date of the photograph is not specified, but it is known that Lenard received the Nobel Prize when he was 43 years old, making it likely that the photograph was taken around that time. Lenard continued to make important contributions to physics throughout his career, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics a second time in 1906 for his work on the photoelectric effect. He went on to hold prestigious academic positions and was a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. Lenard passed away on May 26, 1947, leaving behind a rich legacy in the field of physics. This photograph is a testament to Lenard's remarkable achievements and his place in the annals of scientific history.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
