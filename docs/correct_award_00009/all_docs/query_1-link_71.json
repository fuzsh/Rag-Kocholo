        "text": "Philipp Lenard and Cathode Rays: the Development of Comics for Physics Learning\n\nRahmah Purwahida, Dewi Muliyati, Dini Rahmadini, Ni Larasati Kartika Sari\n\nUniversitas Negeri Jakarta\n\nAbstract\n\nLenard studied how the energy of the emitted photoelectron varies with the intensity of the light. He found that the maximum energy of the ejected electron did not depend on the color but that the shorter wavelength, higher frequency light caused the ejected electron to have a greater energy. In 1905, Lenard was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on cathode rays. Lenard^s research on cathode rays is a historical plot that is rarely presented on the photoelectric effect material in schools. Because of these conditions, students are less interested in studying concepts and phenomena in physics. One of the efforts for improvement is to provide interesting alternative learning media such as comics. This study resulted in comics about Philip Lenard and his research on cathode rays presented in the form of simple cartoon images. From the results of testing to users, it can be concluded that the comics produced are worthy of being an alternative learning media in schools.\n\nKeywords: Philipp Lenard, cathode rays, physics comics\n\nTopic: Physics Education\n\nPlain Format | Corresponding Author (Dewi Muliyati)\n\nShare Link\n\nShare your abstract link to your social media or profile page"
