Playing a teen who aspires to become a musician was not much of a stretch for Demi Lovato, who first made an impression on millions of young fans by starring opposite teen heartthrobs the Jonas Brothers in \"Camp Rock\" (Disney Channel, 2008), then being cast on the star-making tween-comedy series, \"Sonny with a Chance\" (Disney Channel, 2009-2011). With an amiable smile and approachable beauty, Lovato was catapulted to teen icon status and Disney darling in much the same way \"Hannah Montana\" had made Miley Cyrus a superstar only a few years prior. In 2011, Lovato dropped out of \"Sonny with a Chance\" to focus on a music career, which included a new album, Unbroken, and signing on as a judge on the popular music competition series, \"The X-Factor\" (Fox, 2011-14) for its second season. The album \"Demi\" was released on May 10, 2013, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard charts. She also played a recurring character on \"Glee\" during the show's fifth season, and in November 2013, her book \"Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year\" was published. Lovato's next album, \"Confident,\" was released on October 16, 2015, and debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard charts. The album was certified Gold by RIAA in July 2016. Lovato was also the executive producer on the documentary \"Beyond Silence\" (2017), which focused on three people and their experiences with mental illness. The album \"Tell Me You Love Me\" was released on September 29, 2017. Then in 2018 she released the non-album single \"Sober.\"\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n63% Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\n\n60% Princess Protection Program\n\n50% Camp Rock\n\nPhotos\n\nDemi Lovato at arrivals for 2018 Billboard Music Awards - Part 2, MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas, NV May 20, 2018.
