        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCan you believe it's been seven years since Camp Rock, the Disney Channel original movie that introduced us to Mitchie, Shane and crew, made its debut? Neither can Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato. As #7YearsOfCampRock started trending yesterday, the two stars of the sing-along-worthy cult classic took to Twitter to share some love with fans, express their disbelief, and even engage in some good-natured teasing banter. (Talk about how to stay friends with an ex!) Jonas kickstarted the conversation with a heartfelt thanks to \"all the fans who still watch and love the film\" before calling out his co-star with a friendly \"\"#ifeeloldnow what about you @ddlovato?\"\n\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n\nLovato may have nailed her playful response, but the singer also wasted no time getting serious about the movie's amazing impact on her life: \"7 years since my life changed and my dreams came true.\"\n\nAnd if you needed any more proof that Camp Rock still resonates, well, check out this pretty fantastic footage of Lovato and Jonas reuniting onstage during Demi's Staples Center show in Los Angeles last September to sing the film's still-moving penultimate musical number, \"This Is Me.\" Nostalgic yet?"
