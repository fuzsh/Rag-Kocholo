        "text": "Demi Lovato revisited Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam over the weekend. Throughout her rewatch of the classic Disney Channel films, Lovato shared her reactions to her breakout role. Needless to say, there was a lot of laughter happening in Lovato's Instagram stories.\n\nFor those less familiar with Camp Rock, Lovato starred as Mitchie Torres, an aspiring singer who meets the famous pop star Shane Gray (played by Joe Jonas) during her time at a musical summer camp. Mitchie and Shane fall for each other, obviously, and announce their feelings in the climactic final number 'This Is Me.'\n\nLovato, now 27-years-old, was just 16-years-old when Camp Rock first premiered. Like anybody looking back on their teen years, Lovato had fun poking fun at some of the more awkward moments in the movie. When sharing one scene with her co-star Alyson Stoner, Lovato wrote \"the amount of awkward f***ing things I did in this movie... I can't.\"\n\nFollowing her rewatch of Camp Rock, Lovato watched the sequel with her boyfriend Max Ehrich. This special viewing was Ehrich's first time watching Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. Throughout the movie, Lovato shared her boyfriend's reaction to the movies many meme-able moments, as well as the shock ending when Mitchie, Shane and the rest of their camp mates lose the final jam.\n\n\"It has to be Camp Rock,\" Ehrich says in Lovato's video. \"They cheated, right? You guys were better than them so I think that they should really do a recount.\" Lovato tells him she thinks it's \"too late\" for that with a laugh. \"It's never too late,\" Ehrich counters. \"I guess you've gotta make a third movie.\"\n\nLovato isn't opposed to revisiting her Camp Rock roots, either. She once told Ellen Degeneres her idea for a third movie. \"We want to come out with an R-RatedvCamp Rock 3,” she said. “I mean, all of our fans have now grown up and so anybody that watched Camp Rock is now older and can appreciate it.\"\n\nWould you watch a third Camp Rock movie?\n\nPhoto: Getty"
