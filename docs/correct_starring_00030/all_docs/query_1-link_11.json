        "text": "Demi Lovato took a trip down memory lane by watching her old Disney Channel films and brought us with her.\n\nWhile we may have all been big fans of the musical Camp Rock it's clear that Demi doesn't love them in quite the same way we do.\n\nTaking to her Instagram stories, the 27-year-old shared a video of her re-watching the Disney Channel hit where she can be heard in the background narrating and laughing at what she describes as the most 'awkward' scenes.\n\nDemi starred in the Disney Channel film Camp Rock which debuted in 2008 and the sequel in 2010. The cast featured a number of other now-famous faces, including all three Jonas Brothers and the then 16-year-old starlet.\n\nThe first video Demi shares shows a scene of her alongside Camp Rock co-star Alyson Stoner and features Demi laughing in the background.\n\nShe likens her younger self to her half-sister and fellow actress Madison De La Garza and says, 'It's crazy when I see this now I see @maddelagarza.'\n\nContinuing to document the film, Demi teased herself and her performance: 'The amount of awkward f—ing things I did in this movie...I can't.'\n\nHer next video shows a scene between her and Joe Jonas where she confesses how awkward she felt then, and how difficult she finds it to watch now.\n\n'I told y'all how awkward am I,' she writes.\n\nDemi finished her trip into the Disney Archives by showing a clip of her and Alyson Stoner performing the song Our Time is Here from the first Camp Rock movie.\n\nShe admitted: 'This sh— still slaps not gonna lie...'\n\nLooks like we're not the only ones who cringe at our old movies but at least ours weren't released for the world to see."
