        "text": "OAP’s Opinions; My Gran Gives You All The Gossip\n\nHey guys!\n\nToday me and my gran are back to review the Disney Channel Original movie series Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. For other OAP’s Opinion Posts, click here. We received some recommendations from you guys on the last post we did and they will be coming soon! Thank you guys for your suggestions.\n\nSo… Camp Rock:\n\n*These reviews will contain spoilers for both of the Camp Rock films*\n\nMy Review\n\nI actually really enjoyed the first Camp rock film. I haven’t seen it in ages, and as a fan of both Demi Lovato and the Jonas brothers, it immediately seems like something that I would like. The music was a bop and there were some cringe bits, but all around, it was a fun time.\n\nAs a music person, I would love to attend a summer camp like camp rock; an entire summer of making music? Sign me up pronto!\n\nMy only major issue with this film is that it showed Tess learning the lyrics to Michie’s song This Is Me after she found out that Shane had heard someone singing that song and he thought she was awesome. I assumed that this meant that Tess was going to sing it at thee talent show, but she didn’t? What was the point of that scene? It didn’t really lead anywhere.\n\nBut, this film was okay all around and pretty fun to watch.\n\nMy main issue is with Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. Th reason that I titled this review ‘Camp Rock doesn’t make sense’ is because of the sequel. The main premise of this film is that Camp Rock is at war with a rival camp, Camp Star, so they have a big competition to decide which is the best camp.\n\nNow, thee Jonas brothers in this film are a literal boy band. They play a world famous boy band. The winners of the competition are decided by thee general public. Who do you think the public would vote for? Some random summer camp, or a camp with a WORLD FAMOUS BOY BAND? Obviously, if this looked at any sort of facts, or the writers had any common sense, the team with the boy band would win because they have many fans who would vote for them. It’s like if one direction weer competing against Bob from down the road – one direction would clearly win because they have a fan base.\n\nHowever, Camp Star one! How? Don’t ask me! There is no way that in real life the boy band would have been beaten!\n\nBut this film, although frustrating, wasn’t terrible. It featured the Jonas brothers (all of them this time) and showed more of Shane and Michie’s relationship, which was really cute.\n\nI don’t really recommend the second film as much, but the first one is quit fun.\n\nGran’s Review\n\nNow we go to my Gran (in italics) who will be giving you her thoughts on the films. I will be asking her questions about her favourite characters, plots and scenes.\n\nGeneral Thoughts:\n\nThe first one is when she goes and she says her mother is famous because of that girl (Tess). I liked that. I think I preferred it tp the second one. It was very good. Both films were good in fairness, but I think I preferred the first. Like, sometimes, they have the sequel and it isn’t as good.\n\nWhy did you prefer the first film to the second one?\n\nBecause it (lying about her mum) is probably typical of a girl that wants to b include. They want to feel that they belong, so that was her way of doing that. Then, you really find out that… well, I’ve been a firm believer that you should be yourself. I like the second one, but bnot as much as th first. I had the impression that they just… because the first film was open ended… the second was filmed a lot laters so they all looked a lot older, and it wasn’t as feesable.\n\nWho was your favourite character?\n\nWell, I liked the main girl. I thought that she was okay.\n\nWhat was your favourite bit?\n\nProbably th end of the first film where he realises that Michie is the one that wrote the song. even though she didn’t win the contest. In the second one, the disappointment was that I thought they were the better team, and they didn’t win because thee votes were rigged. I didn’t like that.\n\nWould you recommend?\n\nYeah. I think that youngsters would probably like them. My granddaughter likes when I watch them, but I think that most young teen girls, and maybe some if the boys, would like them.\n\nWhat would give it out of ten?\n\nThe first one, I would probably give a nine and the second one a seven, because I wasn’t so fussed.\n\nSo, that was mine and my grandmother’s reviews of Disney’s camp Rock duology. Have you seen these film? What did you think?\n\nWhat films should my Gran reviews next? Let us know in the comments!\n\nI Blog + Gran Blogs xxx"
