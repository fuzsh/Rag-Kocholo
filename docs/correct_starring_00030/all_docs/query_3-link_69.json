        "text": "When we think of Demi Lovato and Disney Channel, we, of course, immediately think of their hit series Sonny with a Chance and iconic film Camp Rock (and Camp Rock 2, obvs). But it turns out, Demi almost ended up on an entirely different show.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast on August 24, Demi reflected on the start of her career on the network, calling it “the golden era of Disney.”\n\n“Hannah Montana had just started like a year or so before, High School Musical had just happened, Selena [Gomez] was on Wizards, and I auditioned for the Jonas Brothers’ TV show,” she said.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, Jonas ran on the Disney Channel for two seasons, from 2009 to 2010. It followed the JoBros’ lives, as they balanced normal teenage situations with their responsibilities as mega pop superstars. Demi was up for the role of their bestie, Stella Malone. However, the part ended up going to actress Chelsea Kane.\n\n“I remember I didn’t get it, and I was crushed. I was heartbroken. But Disney was like, ‘We want to see you for these other two projects,’” they said. “And I was like, OK. I had taken the hardest ‘no’ in my life, and I was just like, I don’t know if I want to go audition again, but I will.”\n\nThose projects were Sonny with a Chance and Camp Rock, and Demi of course booked both.\n\n“So like that, for me, was like, ‘I get my own movie and my own TV show? Are you kidding? Like, on Disney Channel?’ and I knew my life was about to change,” she continued.\n\nThe cultural impact of Sonny with a Chance and Camp Rock is *unmatched*, and we couldn’t imagine anyone but Demi in the lead role. Below, check out Demi’s full Call Her Daddy episode."
