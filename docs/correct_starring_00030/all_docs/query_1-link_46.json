        "text": "2010 was the year of Joe Jonas and Lovato dating in real life after co-starring in the Camp Rock films and touring together. Lovato confirmed the pair was dating, calling him their best friend and proclaiming, \"He's perfect.\" They even posed together on the cover of Teen Vogue where they talked about their blossoming romance.\n\nHowever, less than 48 hours later, the outlet reported that that Jonas and Lovato had decided they were better off has friends. Lovato explained that Jonas was the one to end it. Jonas said, \"In this business, it's really hard to find people who are going to be there for the rest of your life. When I met Demi, I knew right away that our friendship was really strong. I don't want to lose that ever,\" he said.\n\nApparently, that friendship has endured. Lovato even congratulated Jonas on his 2017 engagement to Sophie Turner with a supportive IG comment.\n\nIn their 2017 documentary Simply Complicated, Lovato reflected on the beginning and end of their six-year relationship with Wilmer Valderrama. “I met him on January 11, 2010,” they remembered. “I thought, ‘I have to have him,’ but I was only 17 and he was like, ‘Get away from me’,” as he was more than 12 years older. “When I turned 18 we started dating. I think it was love at first sight, we connected on a level that I’ve never connected with anybody before, he was just my rock, my everything.”\n\nThe pair announced their breakup in a joint statement to social media in 2016. \"After almost six loving and wonderful years together, we have decided to end our relationship,\" the statement read.\"This was an incredibly difficult decision for both of us, but we have realized more than anything that we are better as best friends.\"\n\nThe former couple has remained in each other's lives. Valderrama reportedly visited Lovato during their 2018 hospitalization for a drug overdose. At the start of 2020, Valderrama announced his engagement to model Amanda Pacheco. A source told E! that Lovato was \"happy for Wilmer if he's happy. [They] always want the best for him in life and [are] glad he has found love.\"\n\nE! News reported in September that Lovato had gone on a date with former Bachelorette contestant Mike Johnson. Their fling came after Lovato expressed interest in Johnson via their Instagram story. A source told E! that Lovato \"has always had a huge crush on Mike and once they met in person, there was an instant connection.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Johnson kissed and told on iHeartRadio's Almost Famous podcast saying Lovato \"kisses really well.\" But despite Johnson's excitement in October 2019, People confirmed the couple's break up, which coincided with him asking Keke Palmer out during his appearance on Strahan Sara and Keke. (She politely declined.) E! was told by a source that \"Mike hopes they can have a second chance again. But for now, he's fine with being friendly.\"\n\nNovember brought Lovato's relationship with 25 year old model Austin Wilson. They posted a now-deleted photo of the pair with the caption \"My ❤️...\" Wilson posted his own photo on his account with the caption \"My Love.\" “Demi and Austin have been friends for some time and started dating a little while ago,” a source told People. “They’re enjoying spending time together and getting to know each other better.\"\n\nBy December 2019, People confirmed that Wilson and Lovato had split after a months-long relationship. “[They're] concentrating on [themself] and [their] work right now, as well as focusing on [their] relationship with God,” a source said. “[They're] excited for what this next chapter in 2020 will bring.”\n\nIn late March 2020, Us Weekly broke news of Lovato's romance with former Young and the Restless star Max Ehrich. Although the pair has reportedly only been dating for a few weeks, they started quarantining together. \"Demi and Max have been seeing each other for a few weeks now,\" a source told E!. \"They have been quarantining together at Demi's house and it's going really well.\"\n\nThe insider added, \"He is a good influence on Demi and they have a lot in common. They have a few mutual friends in common, but Demi has been introducing Max to [their] closest friends via Facetime since being quarantined. It's very new but they are definitely hanging out and seeing where it leads. They have spent a lot of time together, but I wouldn't say it's an exclusive relationship yet.\"\n\nEhrich and Lovato got engaged in July 2020, but Lovato ultimately called the relationship off In September 2020. A source said that Lovato realized they didn't \"know who Max truly was and didn't think he had good intentions. There were many red flags [they were] ignoring and trying to turn a blind eye to.\"\n\nLovato's relationship with musician Jutes was first reported in August, with a source telling People at the time, “It's a really happy and healthy relationship. He's a super great guy.”\n\nLovato has since been more public with their romance. The couple attended a pre-Grammys party together in February 2023 and were photographed kissing on the red carpet.\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Lovato shared a birthday tribute to him on Instagram: “My sweet angel - it’s officially your birthday!!! I couldn’t be more excited to celebrate you because I couldn’t be more in love with your gorgeous, funny, sexy, talented self. I’ve waited my whole life to find you and I can’t wait to celebrate so many more birthdays together.. you’re a literal dream come true and I’m so grateful to call you mine. Have the best birthday my love.. you deserve it, the world, and more!!!! Here’s to many more 🥰🥰🖤🖤🎂🎂💫💫 I LOVE YOU 😘😘😘”\n\nLovato spoke about her hopes to marry Jutes in September 2023.\n\n“I’m in an amazing relationship,” they told Howard Stern. “My boyfriend is a year older than me, and we’re growing together and it feels so healthy. We actually met in the studio. So he’s an artist, but he’s also a songwriter. He came in to write on one of my sessions and I was in the studio and was immediately attracted to him. I like texted my friends on the side and was like, ‘He’s so hot!’”\n\nRegarding marriage, they said, “We’ve talked about it. It’s been about a year and a half [of dating], so we’re taking our time with it a little bit, you know? I think it’s important not to rush that.”\n\n“We started off as friends, and we built that foundation of friendship first,” they said. “There’s this partnership there that is just so magnetic, and the way that we laugh together—it’s just nonstop. I think if you can find someone that makes you feel safe, that you’re so attracted to, that you laugh with constantly, that’s the formula of a really great relationship.”"
