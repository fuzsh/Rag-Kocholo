        "text": "Demi Lovato takes a walk down memory lane in a new clip released ahead of her Simply Complicated documentary, in which she revisits the time she first kissed — and fell in love with — Camp Rock co-star Joe Jonas.\n\nIn a fun promo video posted to spread the word about her upcoming YouTube film, the singer looks back on being a child pageant winner and starring in the Disney Channel movie role that put her on the map in 2008.\n\n“Oh my god, wait,” she tells her friends as they’re huddled around a laptop, watching a Mitchie and Shane moment from Camp Rock. “This is the moment I friggin’ fell in love with him, in real life. I wasn’t acting much. We had our first kiss on camera.”\n\nThe relationship only lasted “like a month or two” back when they were teens, she admits — but fans of both should appreciate her sweet reaction. Check it out below, and watch her new documentary on Oct. 17."
