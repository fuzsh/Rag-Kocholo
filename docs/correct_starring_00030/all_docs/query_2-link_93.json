        "text": "Before Kathryn Gallagher was advising her bestie Becks on all things related to dating a murderous stalker in the first season of You, it turns out she had Disney Channel ambitions. Speaking with MTV, the actor revealed that she, like literally everyone else, had dreamed of playing Mitchie in Camp Rock.\n\nCurrently starring in Jagged Little Pill on Broadway, Gallagher said that she’s been singing and playing guitar since the age of 13. At one point, she had hoped to use her musical talent in the Disney Channel original movie, saying, “The first song I wrote on guitar, I was 13 or 14 years old, and I wanted to audition for Camp Rock. I saw the audition online and I went to my parents, and I was like, ‘Hey guys, there’s this movie and there’s this role.’ And they were like, ‘No.’ So I slammed the door, and I went into my room, and I picked up my guitar, and I wrote [this] song called ‘I’m Okay.’”\n\nDespite the initial no from her parental figures, Gallagher didn’t give up. After completing her original song, which was probably fueled by teenage angst around her audition, she returned to her parents: “I knocked on the door and I played it for them, then they actually let me audition.”\n\nUnfortunately, Gallagher didn’t go on to secure the role of Mitchie Torres, but she did share a belated congratulations to Demi Lovato, saying, “Disney was not as sure as I was that it was my role, and Demi Lovato is very incredible in the role, and I loved the movie, and I was jealous I didn’t get to kiss Joe Jonas, but it’s fine.” (Relatable.)\n\nThe You star might not have gotten to share a special moment with Joe’s Shane Grey, but her role as Annika Atwater on You was a more than perfect depiction of Instagram influencers. Plus, in Jagged Little Pill, she gets to flex those Disney Channel-inspired singing and dancing muscles on Broadway. (Fun fact: Musical and acting talent must run in the family, since her dad, Peter Gallagher, once showed off his singing skills on The O.C.) While she’s clearly busy, we wouldn’t be mad if Gallagher returned for a little comic relief in season three of You, somehow working her way into Los Angeles influencer culture...we would like to see it."
