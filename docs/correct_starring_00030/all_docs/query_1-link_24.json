        "text": "\"De-mi! De-mi! De-mi!\"\n\nThe chant rose from 200-plus fans -- mostly girls in their tweens and early teens -- who packed the Cambridge Room of Cleveland's House of Blues for a performance Tuesday evening by actress-singer Demi Lovato, star of \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nDid we mention the Disney Channel's latest original movie co-stars those ultra-popular Jonas Brothers? (Insert ear-splitting shriek here.)\n\n\"I'm just excited to see it,\" Lovato, 15, said during a pre-concert interview. \"I've been kind of nervous, but I don't mind. It's all good.\"\n\nOnstage, she flaunted a strong voice, flashed a 500-watt smile and radiated enough perky energy to fuel an entire cheerleading squad. Those same qualities also serve her well in \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nBrace yourselves: The next \"High School Musical\" could be upon us.\n\nLovato is flattered by such comparisons, although she would just as soon have \"Camp Rock\" appreciated on its own merits.\n\n\"I feel honored anyone would compare it to 'High School Musical,' because 'High School Musical' is such a phenomenon, but they're two totally different movies,\" she said.\n\nWell, to a point. \"Camp Rock\" isn't set in a high school, but at a summer camp (duh) where the cabins are unbelievably tidy and young campers are tutored in the finer points of rock 'n' roll. All the same, they have this familiar habit of breaking into relentlessly infectious songs, penned by some of the same tunesmiths behind all those \"High School Musical\" hits. (Natch, the \"Camp Rock\" soundtrack arrived in stores this week.)\n\nFaithful viewers of the Disney Channel will recognize Lovato from the mirco-series \"As the Bell Rings.\" The Dallas native got her show-biz start on \"Barney & Friends.\" In \"Camp Rock,\" she portrays aspiring singer-songwriter Mitchie Torres, a camper whose deep, dark secret is neither particularly deep nor dark.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" sends a valuable message, Lovato said.\n\n\"It's about being yourself,\" she said. \"Some girls nowadays feel insecure about showing who they are. They try to copy people and they try to be the popular kids in school.\n\n\"And really, it's not about that -- it's about having fun when you're young. You don't want to waste all your time at school trying to fit in, when you could be having fun being nerds with your friends.\n\n\"Me and my best friend, Selena [Gomez, star of Disney Channel's 'Wizards of Waverly Place'], we totally act like kids when we're around each other. We don't worry about trying to fit in. We have a good time.\"\n\nLovato \"really does carry the movie,\" said Michael Healy, Disney Channel's senior vice president for original movies. \"She's an extraordinary find.\"\n\nJoe Jonas plays rocker Shane Gray, a camp counselor with a major attitude problem. His real-life brothers Kevin and Nick have smaller parts, although they're good for a few laughs.\n\n\"Camp Rock\" is a perfect vehicle for the Jonas Brothers -- or \"the Joni,\" as Healy referred to them -- although the project originally wasn't conceived with them in mind.\n\n\"In fact, the Jonas Brothers came into the whole picture late in the game,\" Healy said. \"It started out with a notion to do a rock camp for girls. Then we decided, 'Well, let's get boys in here, too.'\n\n\"We thought Joe Jonas would be good to play the rock star. When the idea came up of using all the Jonas Brothers, which is what their management wanted, we adjusted the script. . . . The boys turned out to be pretty terrific little comedians.\n\n\"We try to make quality movies with good music and relatable stories that touch kids' hearts, then we cast it as well as we possibly can and hope for the best. That was the story with 'High School Musical.' And it's really the story with 'Camp Rock,' too.\"\n\nPrincipal filming was done last summer in Toronto.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun,\" Lovato said. \"The cast was awesome.\"\n\nYes, she still stays in touch with the Jonas Brothers. She'll be the opening act on their upcoming \"Burning Up\" Tour, which stops Friday, Aug. 22, at Blossom Music Center.\n\n\"They're like brothers to me,\" Lovato said. \"If we're not working together, we're IM-ing each other. We're pretty close.\""
