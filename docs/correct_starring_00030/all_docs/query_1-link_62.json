        "text": "August 18, 2022\n\nDemi Lovato became a household name after starring in Disney Channel favorite, Camp Rock. Once she made her transition to the music world with her debut studio album, Don't Forget, Demi skyrocketed to superstardom. Since then, the singer has released seven studio albums, returned to acting and has been honored for her roles in mental health advocacy.\n\nAlthough Demi is known for powerhouse vocals and vulnerable lyrics, her advocacy for mental health and willingness to be open about her road to recovery since dealing with a personal battle with addiction has helped many others dealing with similar issues. iHeartRadio is rewinding the clock to take a look back at the star's personal and musical transformation over the last 14 years. Scroll on for Demi through the years.\n\n2008\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nIn 2008, Demi starred alongside the Jonas Brothers in Camp Rock. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9 million viewers.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nA few months after the success of the TV movie, Demi releases debut studio album, Don't Forget. Ten tracks from the pop-rock album were co-written by her Camp Rock co-stars, the Jonas Brothers.\n\n2009\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nSelena Gomez and Demi Lovato met on the set of Barney and Friends in 2001.

This was the first time a Hollywood Records project was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi Lovato got real in her speech while accepting the Rulebreaker honor at Billboard's Women in Music 2015:\n\n“When I got the Rulebreaker award, I thought it was so awesome because for the first time in my life, and in my career, I felt like I've grown to know who I am as a person and an artist, so being a rule breaker, it's not intentional and that's what's awesome about it. When you're yourself, people see it.”\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi and Nick Jonas joined forces for the Honda Civic Tour Featuring Demi Lovato & Nick Jonas: Future Now.\n\n2017\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nShe released “Sorry Not Sorry,\" which became Demi's best-selling single in the US.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nFebruary 2017, Lovato executive-produced a documentary titled Beyond Silence, which spotlighted three different experiences with mental health.\n\nDemi, staying transparent about her recovery, admitted that her first treatment was not entirely successful in keeping up with sobriety in the October 2017 YouTube documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated.\n\n2018\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi joined Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi for an upbeat, bilingual duet, “Échame la Culpa”.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi announced that her spring Tell Me You Love Me tour would feature pre-show therapy sessions hosted by CAST Centers, an addiction treatment center co-owned by the singer.\n\nAfter being rushed to the hospital in July 2018 from an overdose, the singer had a mostly quiet 2019 out of the spotlight, focusing on personal well-being.\n\n2020\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi's return to music started with a bang when the performer was invited to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl in February 2020.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nAnd she returned to the stage a few weeks later at the Grammy Awards, giving a heart-wrenching debut performance of “Anyone”.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi released an upbeat self-love anthem titled “I Love Me” that spread a message about personal growth and putting yourself first.\n\n2021\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi made our day with a joyful cover of “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers during President Joe Biden’s Inauguration special.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nIn March 2021, a telling, multi-part documentary titled Demi Lovato: Dancing With The Devil was released. In it, the “Anyone” singer revealed more details from the night of her overdose in July 2018.\n\nIn a recent interview, Demi came out as pansexual.\n\n\"I heard someone call the LGBTQIA+ community the alphabet mafia,\" the \"Skyscraper\" musician recalled, adding, \"That's it! That's what I'm going with. I'm part of the alphabet mafia and proud.\"\n\nDemi releases her seventh studio album on April 2, titled Dancing with the Devil... the Art of Starting Over. Lovato explained the album in a livestream:\n\n“If you listen to it track by track, if you follow the track listing, it’s kind of actually like the non-official soundtrack to the documentary. Because it really does follow my life over the past couple of years,” Lovato explained.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDemi officially kicked off the HOLY FVCK tour on August 13th at the Illinois State Fairgrounds.
