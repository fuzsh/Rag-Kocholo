        "meta_description": "As we near the end of Disney Channel Originals Month, we take a look at a film that may exist solely to sell tons of CDs: Camp Rock. Starring Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers, the film follows Demi Lovato as Mitchie, a talented young singer who attends the titular camp to further her musical training. At the camp, she learns to find herself and becomes romantically entangled with one of the Jo Bros. Wake Up Heavy's Mark Begley and The Projection Booth's Mike White join Chris to talk about the film's music, the JoBros acting, and a certain piece of insane IMDb trivia.\r\n\r\nYou can follow Chris Stachiw at @Casualty_Chris and the Kulturecast @kulturecast. The music is Tigerblood Jewel's The Bayou. You can also subscribe to the Kulturecast on iTunes here.
