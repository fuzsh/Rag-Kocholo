        "text": "If we talk about Disney Channel Movies and music everyone thinks about High School Musical right? Well, I understand but for me the best songs produced in Disney Channel Original Movies are in Camp Rock and Lemonade Mouth. These two movies has marked my generation and for singers like Nick Jonas was the beginning of their musical careers.\n\nDisney is a very popular and launched the careers of many celebrities like Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Selena Gomez, Britney Spears and many more…\n\nIn the case of Camp Rock, it launched the careers of the main characters: The Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato. Simultaneously to the movie she signed a contract with a music label and released her first album Don’t Forget (2008). Camp Rock is the second most seen Disney Channel movie. The song track of the movie were place third in Billboard 200 charts and ninth in Billboard 100, the album sold more than 500 000 copies in the US.\n\nThe pop rock style they promoted was very appreciated by the public and this made some of their songs iconic to the Disney Channel generation. We all know the song This is me the iconic duet of Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato ending the first movie.\n\nCamp Rock was a good movie with amazing song and choreographies that we could learn. I discovered a new kind of music that intrigued me and because of this song I started learning english.\n\nLemonade Mouth is my second favourite Disney Channel movie, the songs are relatable and encouraging. The songs of the movie are motivating, when you feel down you they’ll cheer you up. As all Disney movie, Lemonade Mouth too promotes friendships and in this particular movie it gathers five students from different backgrounds but a common passion.\n\nThe Disney like high school life and the unrealistic meeting of the characters leading to their first song is a way to make us dream of a possibility that this could happen to us too.\n\nWhat we can deduce by this Disney generation is that music is central to their movies. If the public likes the music and the reliable characters they present the movie would have a great success. All the movies I talked about today won awards and had great places in Billboard charts. They may be Disney songs but at the time they reached a great number of people.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nAyBee"
