        "text": "Demi Lovato - This Is Me\n\nCamp Rock was released in the summer of 2008, to an audience of almost 9 million viewers, making it the third highest-viewed Disney Channel Original Movie of all time. Whereas the other two–Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie and High School Musical 2–had built-in viewerships made up of tweens who were already fans anyway, Camp Rock was a brand new franchise, with a brand new star. Obviously, it appealed to fans of the already popular Jonas Brothers, but I like to think that the majority of interest was in Demi Lovato’s giant smile flashing across TV screens during every commercial break weeks before the premiere, I like to think that people, children and their parents, tweens at sleepovers, insomniac college students, saw Demi Lovato, maybe recognized her from her short-lived and lesser-known short series As the Bell Rings, noticed that there was something infectious and delightful about her presence, and wanted to know more. I mean, I didn’t have cable at the time, and I heard about Camp Rock through a Jonas Brothers-obsessed friend, but it’s what I like to think, you know?\n\nAnyway, so Camp Rock is about this adorable, shy, eager teen girl named Mitchie Torres, who dreams daily of attending a music camp called Camp Rock, Unfortunately, her family is kind of poor, what with her mother’s catering business just taking off. But then, she gets a surprise–her mom has been invited to be the camp cook! Meanwhile, Joe Jonas is a member of a band not unlike the band he is actually a member of in real life, and his two brothers are tired of his arrogant behavior so they send him to be a mentor at this camp. Joe Jonas is walking around being hilariously mean for no reason when he hears Demi practicing her original song “This is Me” and falls in love but doesn’t know who the voice belongs to.\n\nDemi, or Mitchie, also lies to the it girl of the summer camp, whose actress faded into obscurity for a reason, I’m just saying, about who her mother is, and Mitchie is accepted into it girl’s group. Some other complicated, unlikely drama happens, beginning with a food fight that breaks apart the it girl’s core group, but none of it is very serious because this is a DCOM. Along the way, Joe Jonas decides he hates Mitchie because she lied about her mom and he thinks she did it to use him instead of just to be accepted. Finally, at the talent show, Joe hears Mitchie singing and realizes her voice is the one he’s been in love with all this time! They sing together but don’t kiss because again, this is a DCOM.\n\nIt’s not my favorite Disney Channel Movie. It’s not even my favorite Disney Channel Movie starring Demi Lovato. But “This Is Me” is one of my favorite Demi songs by far.\n\nThe thing is, Demi isn’t that great at playing the shy girl next door. If you only watch this scene, you can see how unbelievable her act is when she walks onstage, apparently awkward and afraid. But she’s amazing at playing someone confident and she’s great at being a rock star. She wants you to believe that at her core, she’s amazing and she’s real and she’s just as perfect as you thought she was the first time you heard her anonymous voice. She’s an angel of music and she’s gonna let the light shine down on her. In that moment, you believe her.\n\nI feel like this is true of most people. There’s one thing we excel at, one thing that makes us feel like we are real, like we are our best selves at that moment. We’re everything we are doing the thing we’re best at, and we’re exactly where we’re supposed to be. I think it’s because I want to believe I’m nothing but the best parts of myself. I think it’s because I want to shine so bright you can’t see beyond everything I’m putting on display. I want to believe it so much, even when I know it isn’t strictly true. I wonder how much Demi herself felt that way, fifteen years old and standing at the edge of fame that, by every account, she would come to believe she hadn’t been ready for."
