        "text": "Shutterstock | 2914948\n\nLike many successful singers today, Demi Lovato started her career with \"Disney Channel\" as a an actress.\n\nAlthough many fans loved the singer's time on the children's network, Lovato does not feel the same. In her upcoming docuseries titled \"Dancing with the Devil,\" the \"Heartbreak\" singer opened up about the secret she has kept for a long time.\n\nLovato first began acting as a child, by appearing in the cartoon \"Barney & Friends.\" When she was barely a teenager, she moved to Los Angeles after her then-friend, Selena Gomez, began starring in “Waverly Place.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDisney Debut\n\nInstagram / Demi Lovato\n\nThe 28-year-old made her debut in the first season of \"As the Bell Rings\" before she landed her big break in the movie \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nThe \"Disney Channel\" movie showed off her impressive vocal talent and i Trod iced her to the world as an upcoming musician.\n\nShe released multiple albums via \"Disney's Hollywood Records.\" Lovato also began a personal series titled \"Sonny with a Chance.\"\n\nAsides from being a Disney star, Lovato was in a relationship with another Disney star, Joe Jonas, while her co-star, Selena Gomez, dated Nick Jonas.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDisney Lovers\n\nPhotographer Group/MEGA\n\nThe pair brought their relationship to screen and starred together as lovers in \"Camp Rock,\" thanks to fans who wanted it to happen in the first place.\n\nThey spent time together on trips before finally breaking up in 2010 after months of dating. They, however, remained friends after their breakup.\n\nIn her docuseries, Lovato revealed that she was raped at age 15 by someone she was \"hooking up with.\" She shared via \"Yahoo\" that she had told the person at the time that she didn't want to go any further, but that didn't stop ‘them’ as they did it anyway.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nStaying Pure As Role Models\n\nMEGA\n\nLike the other Disney child stars such as the Jonas Brothers, Lovato always had on a purity ring, to signify that she was going to wait till marriage before having sexual contact with anyone.\n\nLovato shared that pressure was especially mounted on the girls more than the boys, especially as a child role model.\n\nIn August 2007, Lovato turned 15 and won roles in “Sonny with a Chance” and “Camp Rock” in that year. The movie \"Camp Rock\" premiered in June 2008, while “Sonny with a Chance” didn't premiere until February 2009.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAssaulted By A Co-star\n\nMEGA\n\nAlthough Lovato decided not to name the person who raped her, she made some pretty alarming statements.\n\nShe shared that she had to see the person all the time. Fans garnered that it had to be a co-star from any of the TV shows that she started in. Which does not in any way narrows the list down.\n\nThe singer has since moved on from the trauma and is now lending her voice to other survivors.\n\nHer comments on the rape were part of a more extensive discussion about her drug use, bulimia and alcohol addiction. The \"Sorry, Not Sorry\" singer opened up about her eating disorder and how her then management in 2018 sought to control it."
