        "text": "Demi Lovato had a unique way of celebrating the 15th anniversary of \"Camp Rock,\" a 2008 musical television film directed by Matthew Diamond.\n\nLovato, who wowed her fans with exceptional singing and acting skills, rose to international stardom following her role in the Disney Channel Original movie.\n\nCommemorating the moment that introduced her to the limelight and helped shape her career in the entertainment industry, she spent her day enjoying the company of her boyfriend, Jutes and revisiting memories. As fans may know, Jutes Music, originally named Jordan Lutes, is Lovato's boyfriend. The lovebirds became Instagram official in November 2022.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDemi Lovato Watches Herself As 'Mitchie Torres' Joined By BF\n\nThe \"Heart Attack\" crooner, who has etched her name in the minds of her ever-supportive followers and fans due to her powerful and high-pitched voice, revealed how she marked the anniversary of the movie she starred in 15 years ago.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTaking to her Instagram Story, Lovato posted a photo of a tv playing the opening scene of the Disney movie \"Camp Rock.\" Explaining the reason for her post, she revealed in her caption, \"Showing @jutesmusic camp rock for the 15th anniversary ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.\"\n\nThe 2008 musical film tells the story of an aspiring teenage singer Mitchie Torres, played by Lovato, who visits a summer music camp called Camp Rock and faces trials and tribulations to fit in and achieve her goal. The Disney Original movie was successful with 8.9 million viewers, earning it the third-highest-viewed DCOM of all time.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHowever, earlier in July 2020, the \"Barney & Friends\" actress disclosed how she truly felt about her character in the hit movie. Lovato took to her Insta Story to reveal that she rewatched the Disney favorite while giving hilarious commentary about her character's awkwardness.\n\nCaptioning the post, she wrote, \"The amount of awkward fâ€”ing things I did in this movieâ€¦ I can't.\" Further poking fun at a scene where she was with singer Joe Jonas, she added, \"I said yall - how awkward am I?!!!\"\n\nAlthough the \"La La Land\" singer didn't seem pleased with some of her acting skills in the movie, she enjoyed the music in the film. Sharing another clip of herself performing the song \"Our Time Is Here,\" she wrote in the caption, \"This sâ€“t still slaps not gonna lieâ€¦.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFormer BFF Selena Gomez Turned Down Acting In 'Camp Rock' For Lovato\n\nWhile the \"Simply Complicated\" actress got to prove herself as a brilliant actress in the 2008 musical film, it came at the cost of her close friend sacrificing her opportunity to star as the lead character in the widely watched movie.\n\nAccording to HOLA, David DeLuise, who played Selena Gomez's dad on \"Wizards of Waverly Place,\" revealed during an interview with \"Wildchat Sports\" how Gomez turned down the offer to be part of the cast in the film.\n\nIf many might recall, Gomez and Lovato had a pretty solid relationship in the past when the two stars starred in \"Barney & Friends\" during the early years of their careers. Their bond tightened so much that they became closer during their teenage years and further acted together in the \"Princess Protection Program.\"\n\nAs for the kind gesture Gomez showed to the \"Sky Scraper\" singer during the pre-production stages of the musical project, DeLuise spilled the tea, saying, \"I've never really said this story, but they offered Camp Rock to Selena, and she knew that if she passed on it, Demi would get the part.\"\n\nHe continued, \"She passed on it, which was very nice. And they were friends. They were on the show Barney together.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nFans Of Lovato Called Out Disney Channel For Failing To Acknowledge The Singer\n\nAlthough the 30-year-old actress has significantly contributed to the successful running of Disney Channel following her appearance in their movies, the Channel's actions on their 40th anniversary showed the level of value they placed on Lovato.\n\nPer reports, Disney, while celebrating their anniversary, compiled a list of 12 Iconic Wand IDs featuring famous faces, including, \"Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Raven Symone, the Jonas Brothers, Brenda Song, and so much more.\n\nHowever, an important face didn't make it into the tribute video, and it was no one other than Lovato. It seemed this act didn't shock her supporters since the singer, in her 2021 documentary, \"Demi Lovato: Dancing with the Devil,\" revealed that while she was a teen on the Channel, \"she was raped by a fellow Disney actor.\""
