        "text": "Albums and Hit Songs\n\n‘Don’t Forget’ and ‘Here We Go Again’\n\nOn September 23, 2008, Lovato released her first album, Don’t Forget, which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. In promotion of this album, Lovato went on tour with the Jonas Brothers on their Burnin’ Up Tour as the opening act. On July 21, 2009, the artist released her second album, Here We Go Again. The title track reached No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her first single to reach the Top 20. She went on tour again with the Jonas Brothers the following year and was romantically linked to Joe Jonas around this time.\n\n‘Unbroken,’ ‘Demi,’ ‘Confident,’ ‘Tell Me You Love Me’\n\nLovato released the 2011 album Unbroken, which featured the platinum top 10 hit “Skyscraper.” She put out her next record, Demi, two years later, which had the best debut week of her music career. In 2015, Lovato unveiled a new single entitled “Cool for the Summer” from her album Confident. The single hit No. 11 on the Hot 100, while the album reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The artist enjoyed more success with her follow-up album, Tell Me You Love Me (2017), which spawned the hit single “Sorry Not Sorry.”\n\nMore TV: ‘The X Factor,’ ‘Glee’\n\nIn 2012, Lovato took on a new role. She joined The X Factor in its second season as a judge. Lovato, Simon Cowell, music industry titan L.A. Reid and pop star Britney Spears worked together to review the contestants and helped determine who would win the $5 million recording contract. The show was canceled after its third season.\n\nLovato made a return to acting in 2013 with a recurring role on the hit musical series Glee. She appeared on then-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama’s show From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series in 2015 and continued to contribute to reality TV competitions, serving as a guest judge on RuPaul‘s Drag Race in 2015, and Project Runway and The Voice of Germany in 2017.\n\nShortly after making her debut as a guest star on Will & Grace in January 2020, Lovato was tapped to perform at the Grammy Awards and sing the national anthem at Super Bowl LIV.\n\nHistory With Substance Abuse\n\nWhile on tour with the Jonas Brothers in 2010, Lovato got into an altercation with a dancer. The fight made headlines, and she sought treatment after the incident. According to People magazine, the singer sought help for “emotional and physical issues.” Some of these issues were later revealed to be an eating disorder, self-harm through cutting and bipolar disorder.\n\nLovato drew attention for the June 2018 release of the single “Sober,” in which she candidly admits to relapsing after six years of sobriety. On July 24, 2018, the singer was rushed to the hospital for an apparent overdose. TMZ reported that she was found unconscious and was revived with Narcan, a medication to reverse the effects of a narcotic overdose. She was later said to be in stable condition at the hospital, with ex-boyfriend Valderrama frequently dropping by to check on her condition.\n\nAddressing the issue for the first time via an Instagram post on August 5, Lovato acknowledged the ongoing difficulties of dealing with addiction and thanked fans for their support. “The love you have all shown me will never be forgotten and I look forward to the day where I can say I came out on the other side,” she wrote. “I will keep fighting.”"
