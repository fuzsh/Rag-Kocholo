Demi Lovato has evolved throughout her many years in the spotlight.

Lovato became a household name after starring in Disney Channel’s Camp Rock franchise alongside the Jonas Brothers and her own sitcom, Sonny With a Chance. Following her TV success, Lovato checked into rehab in 2010 for substance abuse issues.

Upon her return to the spotlight, Locator focused her career on music, releasing hit after hit including songs “Skyscraper,” “Confident,” “Give Your Heart a Break,” “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Cool for the Summer.”

After celebrating six years of sobriety in 2018, Lovato eventually relapsed. In July 2018, she was hospitalized after a near-fatal drug overdose before completing treatment at a rehabilitation facility.

Lovato came out as non-binary in May 2021, intending to go by they/them pronouns. Nearly two years later, Lovato said on the “Sprout” podcast that was “feeling more feminine” and would go back to using she/her pronouns.
