So let's sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

Come on and sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

This is our song, that's all that matters

'Cause we all belong right here together

There's nothing better than singing along

This is our summer, this is our song

Come grab your guitar, sit by the fire

'Cause we all need a song when we're weary and tired

We'll sit here together and sing it out loud (sing it out loud)

This is our song, that's all that matters

'Cause we all belong right here together

There's nothing better than singing along

This is our summer, this is our song

This is our song, this is our song, this is our song

- What's that?

- Hi.. we saw the fire

- We really don't get to do this kind of thing

- So we were hoping there was some room for some of us to join?

- There's always room.

- Brown if it's ok with you I really would like to come back to Camp Rock next summer?

- Come on

Come on and sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

- Hey, can I get a little help inside? The phones are going crazy!

- Yeah I'll help.

- I told my parents I want to come here instead next summer.

Come on and sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

- Please, can you put us on the list? This place is so much more fun.

- I'm sure we can work something out.

And come on and sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

Come on and sing

Na, na na na na, hey ya

This is our song, that's all that matters

'Cause we all belong right here together

There's nothing better than singing along

This is our summer

This is our song, that's all that matters

'Cause we all belong right here together

There's nothing better than singing along

This is our summer, this is our song
