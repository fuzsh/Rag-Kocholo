Future Changes of Compound Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers in the North Atlantic

Ferran Lopez-Marti, Mireia Ginesta, Davide Faranda, Anna Rutgersson, Pascal Yiou, Lichuan Wu, and Gabriele Messori

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers are two main drivers of extreme weather in Europe. In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.

Sea spray emissions from the Baltic Sea: comparison of aerosol eddy covariance fluxes and chamber-simulated sea spray emissions

Julika Zinke, Ernst Douglas Nilsson, Piotr Markuszewski, Paul Zieger, Eva Monica MÃ¥rtensson, Anna Rutgersson, Erik Nilsson, and Matthew Edward Salter

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1895–1918, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1895-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1895-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

We conducted two research campaigns in the Baltic Sea, during which we combined laboratory sea spray simulation experiments with flux measurements on a nearby island. To combine these two methods, we scaled the laboratory measurements to the flux measurements using three different approaches. As a result, we derived a parameterization that is dependent on wind speed and wave state for particles with diameters 0.015–10 μm. This parameterization is applicable to low-salinity waters.

Technical note: Extending sea level time series for the analysis of extremes with statistical methods and neighbouring station data

KÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson

Ocean Sci., 20, 21–30, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Coastal floods occur due to extreme sea levels (ESLs) which are difficult to predict because of their rarity. Long records of accurate sea levels at the local scale increase ESL predictability. Here, we apply a machine learning technique to extend sea level observation data in the past based on a neighbouring tide gauge. We compared the results with a linear model. We conclude that both models give reasonable results with a better accuracy towards the extremes for the machine learning model.

Influence of data source and copula statistics on estimates of compound extreme water levels in a river mouth environment

KÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-176,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-176, 2023

Revised manuscript under review for NHESS

Short summary

Short summary

Both extreme river discharge and storm surges can interact at the coast and lead to flooding. However, it is difficult to predict flood levels during such compound events because they are rare and complex. Here, we focus on the quantification of uncertainties; and we investigate the sources of limitations while carrying out such analyses at Halmstad city (Sweden). Based on a sensitivity analysis, we emphasize that both the choice of data source and statistical methodology influence the results.

On physical mechanisms enhancing airâsea CO2 exchange

LucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez-Loza, Erik Nilsson, Marcus B. Wallin, Erik SahlÃ©e, and Anna Rutgersson

Biogeosciences, 19, 5645–5665, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere is an essential aspect of the global carbon cycle and is highly relevant for the Earth's climate. In this study, we used 9 years of in situ measurements to evaluate the temporal variability in the air–sea CO2 fluxes in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, using this long record, we assessed the effect of atmospheric and water-side mechanisms controlling the efficiency of the air–sea CO2 exchange under different wind-speed conditions.

Short summary

Short summary

Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge about the effects of global warming on past and future changes in the climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere.

Earth Syst. Dynam., 12, 939–973, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Regional climate studies are typically pursued by single Earth system component models (e.g., ocean models and atmosphere models). These models are driven by prescribed data which hamper the simulation of feedbacks between Earth system components. To overcome this, models were developed that interactively couple model components and allow an adequate simulation of Earth system interactions important for climate. This article reviews recent developments of such models for the Baltic Sea region.

Cyanobacteria net community production in the Baltic Sea as inferred from profiling pCO2 measurements

Jens Daniel MÃ¼ller, Bernd Schneider, Ulf GrÃ¤we, Peer Fietzek, Marcus Bo Wallin, Anna Rutgersson, Norbert Wasmund, Siegfried KrÃ¼ger, and Gregor Rehder

Biogeosciences, 18, 4889–4917, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Based on profiling pCO2 measurements from a field campaign, we quantify the biomass production of a cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic Sea, the export of which would foster deep water deoxygenation. We further demonstrate how this biomass production can be accurately reconstructed from long-term surface measurements made on cargo vessels in combination with modelled temperature profiles. This approach enables a better understanding of a severe concern for the Balticâs good environmental status.

Statistics of sea-effect snowfall along the Finnish coastline based on regional climate model data

Taru Olsson, Anna Luomaranta, Kirsti JylhÃ¤, Julia Jeworrek, Tuuli Perttula, Christian Dieterich, Lichuan Wu, Anna Rutgersson, and Antti MÃ¤kelÃ¤

Adv. Sci. Res., 17, 87–104, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-17-87-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-17-87-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

Statistics of the frequency and intensity of snow bands affecting the Finnish coast during years 2000–2010 was conducted. A set of criteria for meteorological variables favoring the formation of the snow bands were applied to regional climate model (RCA4) data. We found on average three days per year with favorable conditions for coastal sea-effect snowfall. The heaviest convective snowfall events were detected most frequently over the southern coastline.

The potential of using remote sensing data to estimate air–sea CO2 exchange in the Baltic Sea

GaÃ«lle Parard, Anna Rutgersson, Sindu Raj Parampil, and Anastase Alexandre Charantonis

Earth Syst. Dynam., 8, 1093–1106, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Coastal environments and shelf sea represent 7.6 % of the total oceanic surface area. They are, however, biogeochemically more dynamic and probably more vulnerable to climate change than the open ocean. Whatever the responses of the open ocean to climate change, they will propagate to the coastal ocean. We used the self-organizing multiple linear output (SOMLO) method to estimate the ocean surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea from remotely sensed measurements and we estimated the air–sea CO2 flux.

Ship emissions and the use of current air cleaning technology: contributions to air pollution and acidification in the Baltic Sea

BjÃ¶rn Claremar, Karin Haglund, and Anna Rutgersson

Earth Syst. Dynam., 8, 901–919, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Shipping is the most cost-effective option for the global transport of goods, and over 90 % of world trade is carried by sea. The shipping sector, however, contributes to emissions of pollutants into the air and water. Estimates of deposition and near-surface concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate matter originating from shipping in the Baltic Sea region have been developed for present conditions concerning traffic intensity and fuel as well as for future scenarios until 2050.

Characteristics of convective snow bands along the Swedish east coast

Julia Jeworrek, Lichuan Wu, Christian Dieterich, and Anna Rutgersson

Earth Syst. Dynam., 8, 163–175, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Convective snow bands develop in response to a cold air outbreak from the continent over an open water surface. In the Baltic Sea region these cause intense snowfall and can cause serious problems for traffic, infrastructure and other important establishments of society. The conditions for these events to occur were characterized and the potential of using a regional modelling system was evaluated. The modelling system was used to develop statistics of these events to occur in time and space.

Interannual variability of the midsummer drought in Central America and the connection with sea surface temperatures

Tito Maldonado, Anna Rutgersson, Eric Alfaro, Jorge Amador, and BjÃ¶rn Claremar

Adv. Geosci., 42, 35–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016, 2016

Short summary

Short summary

We studied the relationship between the midsummer drought (MSD) in Central America, and the sea surface temperatures (SST) of the neighbouring ocean in interannual scales. Besides, the motivation of this study is also to provide a systematic method for forecasting the MSD period. We found that the intensity and the magnitude of the MSD shown a strong association with the contrast in the surface temperatures between the eastern tropical Pacific, and the tropical north Atlantic.

Short summary

Short summary

In this paper, we used combines two existing methods (i.e. self-organizing maps and multiple linear regression) to estimate the ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 in the Baltic Sea from the remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, coloured dissolved organic matter, net primary production, and mixed-layer depth. The outputs of this research have a horizontal resolution of 4km and cover the 1998â2011 period. These outputs give a monthly map of the Baltic Sea.

Short summary

Short summary

Eight current meters were deployed to the seafloor across the Baltic to enhance knowledge about circulation and currents. The experiment was complemented by autonomous vehicles. Stable circulation patterns were observed at the sea when weather was steady. Strong and quite persistent currents were observed at the key passage for the deep-water renewal of the Northern Baltic Sea. Deep water renewal mostly occurs during spring and summer periods in the northern Baltic Sea.

Short summary

Short summary

Using the satellite-based climate data record CLARA-A3 spanning 1982–2020 and ERA5 reanalysis, we present climate regimes that are favourable or unfavourable for solar energy applications. We show that the favourable climate regimes are emerging over much of Europe during spring and early summer for solar energy exploitation.

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1835–1842, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

We study the relationship between tracks of low-pressure systems and related sea level extremes. We perform the studies by introducing a method to simulate sea levels using synthetic low-pressure systems. We test the method using sites located along the Baltic Sea coast. We find high extremes, where the sea level extreme reaches up to 3.5 m. In addition, we add the maximal value of the mean level of the Baltic Sea (1 m), leading to a sea level of 4.5 m.

Short summary

Short summary

The HiDEM code has been developed for analyzing the fracture and fragmentation of brittle materials and has been extensively applied to glacier calving. Here, we report on the adaptation of the code to sea-ice dynamics and breakup. The code demonstrates the capability to simulate sea-ice dynamics on a 100 km scale with an unprecedented resolution. We argue that codes of this type may become useful for improving forecasts of sea-ice dynamics.

The usefulness of Extended-Range Probabilistic Forecasts for Heat wave forecasts in Europe

Preprint under review for NHESS

Short summary

Short summary

The skill of hindcasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in forecasting heat wave days (periods with the 5-day moving average temperature being above its local summer 90th percentile) over Europe 1 to 4 weeks ahead is examined. The heat wave days forecasts show potential in warning of heat risk in 1–2 weeks in advance, and enhanced accuracy in forecasting prolonged heat waves, in lead times of up to 3 weeks, when the heat wave had initiated prior to the forecast issuance.

Tropical cyclone low-level wind speed, shear, and veer: sensitivity to the boundary layer parametrization in the Weather Research and Forecasting model

Sara MÃ¼ller, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, and David Robert Verelst

Wind Energ. Sci., 9, 1153–1171, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-1153-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-1153-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Tropical cyclone winds are challenging for wind turbines. We analyze a tropical cyclone before landfall in a mesoscale model. The simulated wind speeds and storm structure are sensitive to the boundary parametrization. However, independent of the boundary layer parametrization, the median change in wind speed and wind direction with height is small relative to wind turbine design standards. Strong spatial organization of wind shear and veer along the rainbands may increase wind turbine loads.

Modelling wind farm effects in HARMONIEâAROME (cycle 43.2.2) â Part 1: Implementation and evaluation

Geosci. Model Dev., 17, 2855–2875, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2855-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2855-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Wind farms impact local wind and turbulence. To incorporate these effects in weather forecasting, the explicit wake parameterization (EWP) is added to the forecasting model HARMONIE–AROME. We evaluate EWP using flight data above and downstream of wind farms, comparing it with an alternative wind farm parameterization and another weather model. Results affirm the correct implementation of EWP, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for wind farm effects in accurate weather forecasting.

Short summary

Short summary

The Fennoscandian boreal and mountain regions harbour a wide range of ecosystems sensitive to climate change. A new, highly resolved high-emission climate scenario enabled modelling of the vegetation development in this region at high resolution for the 21st century. The results show dramatic south to north and low- to high-altitude shifts of vegetation zones, especially for the open tundra environments, which will have large implications for nature conservation, reindeer husbandry and forestry.

Short summary

Short summary

We propose a number of priority areas for the international climate research community to address over the coming ~6 years (i.e. to 2030). Advances in these areas will increase our understanding of past and future Earth system change, including the societal and environmental impacts of this change, as well as deliver significantly improved scientific support to international climate policy, such as the 7th IPCC Assessment Report and the UNFCCC Global Stocktake under the Paris Climate Agreement.

Transport dynamics in a complex coastal archipelago

Elina Miettunen, Laura Tuomi, Antti Westerlund, Hedi Kanarik, and Kai Myrberg

Ocean Sci., 20, 69–83, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-69-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-69-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

We studied circulation and transports in the Archipelago Sea (in the Baltic Sea) with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Transport dynamics show different variabilities in the north and south, so no single transect can represent transport through the whole area in all cases. The net transport in the surface layer is southward and follows the alignment of the deeper channels. In the lower layer, the net transport is southward in the northern part of the area and northward in the southern part.

Technical note: Extending sea level time series for the analysis of extremes with statistical methods and neighbouring station data

Coastal floods occur due to extreme sea levels (ESLs) which are difficult to predict because of their rarity. Long records of accurate sea levels at the local scale increase ESL predictability. Here, we apply a machine learning technique to extend sea level observation data in the past based on a neighbouring tide gauge. We compared the results with a linear model. We conclude that both models give reasonable results with a better accuracy towards the extremes for the machine learning model.

Exploring extreme event attribution by using long-running meteorological observations

Erik Holmgren and Erik KjellstrÃ¶m

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Associating extreme weather events to changes in the climate remains difficult. We have explored how these relationships can be investigated using a more common method, and relying solely on long-running observational records of temperature and precipitation.

Our results show that while both methods lead to similar conclusions for two recent weather events in Sweden, the commonly used method risks underestimating the strength of the connection between the event and changes to the climate.

Influence of data source and copula statistics on estimates of compound extreme water levels in a river mouth environment

Revised manuscript under review for NHESS

Short summary

Short summary

Both extreme river discharge and storm surges can interact at the coast and lead to flooding. However, it is difficult to predict flood levels during such compound events because they are rare and complex. Here, we focus on the quantification of uncertainties; and we investigate the sources of limitations while carrying out such analyses at Halmstad city (Sweden). Based on a sensitivity analysis, we emphasize that both the choice of data source and statistical methodology influence the results.

Short summary

Short summary

Typical wave statistics don’t provide information on how often certain wave heights are exceeded and the length of such events. Our study found a strong seasonal dependence for 2.5 m and 4 m wave events in the Baltic Sea. Wave heights over 7 m occurred less than once per year. The amount of 1 m wave events can double within 20 km in nearshore areas. Our results are important for all operations at sea, including ship traffic and fish farming.

Did the Bronze Age deforestation of Europe affect its climate? A regional climate model study using pollen-based land cover reconstructions

Gustav Strandberg, Jie Chen, Ralph Fyfe, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Johan LindstrÃ¶m, Anneli Poska, Qiong Zhang, and Marie-JosÃ© Gaillard

Clim. Past, 19, 1507–1530, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

The impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) on the climate around 2500 years ago is studied using reconstructions and models. The results suggest that LULCC impacted the climate in parts of Europe. Reconstructed LULCC shows up to 1.5 Â°C higher temperature in parts of Europe in some seasons. This relatively strong response implies that anthropogenic LULCC that had occurred by the late prehistoric period may have already affected the European climate by 2500 years ago.

Bayesian hierarchical modelling of sea-level extremes in the Finnish coastal region

Olle RÃ¤ty, Marko Laine, Ulpu Leijala, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, and Milla M. Johansson

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2403–2418, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We studied annual maximum sea levels in the Finnish coastal region. Our aim was to better quantify the uncertainty in them compared to previous studies. Using four statistical models, we found out that hierarchical models, which shared information on sea-level extremes across Finnish tide gauges, had lower uncertainty in their results in comparison with tide-gauge-specific fits. These models also suggested that the shape of the distribution for extreme sea levels is similar on the Finnish coast.

Newly digitized wind speed observations provide data from the time period from around 1920 to the present, enveloping one full century of wind measurements. The results of this work enable the investigation of the historical variability and trends in surface wind speed in Sweden for the last century.

The role of preconditioning for extreme storm surges in the western Baltic Sea

Elin AndrÃ©e, Jian Su, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Martin Stendel, and Kristine Skovgaard Madsen

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1817–1834, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

When natural processes interact, they may compound each other. The combined effect can amplify extreme sea levels, such as when a storm occurs at a time when the water level is already higher than usual. We used numerical modelling of a record-breaking storm surge in 1872 to show that other prior sea-level conditions could have further worsened the outcome. Our research highlights the need to consider the physical context of extreme sea levels in measures to reduce coastal flood risk.

Wind Energ. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2022-102,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2022-102, 2023

Revised manuscript not accepted

Short summary

Short summary

We study how climate change will impact extreme winds and choice of turbine class. We use data from 18 CMIP6 members from a historic and a future period to access the change in the extreme winds. The analysis shows an overall increase in the extreme winds in the North Sea and the southern Baltic Sea, but a decrease over the Scandinavian Peninsula and most of the Baltic Sea. The analysis is inconclusive to whether higher or lower classes of turbines will be installed in the future.

On physical mechanisms enhancing airâsea CO2 exchange

LucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez-Loza, Erik Nilsson, Marcus B. Wallin, Erik SahlÃ©e, and Anna Rutgersson

Biogeosciences, 19, 5645–5665, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere is an essential aspect of the global carbon cycle and is highly relevant for the Earth's climate. In this study, we used 9 years of in situ measurements to evaluate the temporal variability in the air–sea CO2 fluxes in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, using this long record, we assessed the effect of atmospheric and water-side mechanisms controlling the efficiency of the air–sea CO2 exchange under different wind-speed conditions.

Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n and SÃ¸ren Ott

Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 2457–2468, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-2457-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-2457-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

A method is developed for calculating the extreme wind in tropical-cyclone-affected water areas. The method is based on the spectral correction method that fills in the missing wind variability to the modeled time series, guided by best track data. The paper provides a detailed recipe for applying the method and the 50-year winds of equivalent 10 min temporal resolution from 10 to 150 m in several tropical-cyclone-affected regions.

Short summary

Short summary

Hydrological models projecting the impact of changing climate carry a lot of uncertainty. Thus, these models usually have a multitude of simulations using different future climate data. This study used the subjective opinion of experts to assess which climate and hydrological models are the most likely to correctly predict climate impacts, thereby easing the computational burden. The experts could select more likely hydrological models, while the climate models were deemed equally probable.

Present and future European heat wave magnitudes: climatologies, trends, and their associated uncertainties in GCM-RCM model chains

Changgui Lin, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Renate Anna Irma Wilcke, and Deliang Chen

Earth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1197–1214, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1197-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1197-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

This study endorses RCMs' added value on the driving GCMs in representing observed heat wave magnitudes. The future increase of heat wave magnitudes projected by GCMs is attenuated when downscaled by RCMs. Within the downscaling, uncertainties can be attributed almost equally to choice of RCMs and to the driving data associated with different GCMs. Uncertainties of GCMs in simulating heat wave magnitudes are transformed by RCMs in a complex manner rather than simply inherited.

Classification and properties of non-idealized coastal wind profiles â an observational study

Christoffer Hallgren, Johan Arnqvist, Erik Nilsson, Stefan Ivanell, Metodija Shapkalijevski, August Thomasson, Heidi Pettersson, and Erik SahlÃ©e

Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 1183–1207, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1183-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1183-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Non-idealized wind profiles with negative shear in part of the profile (e.g., low-level jets) frequently occur in coastal environments and are important to take into consideration for offshore wind power. Using observations from a coastal site in the Baltic Sea, we analyze in which meteorological and sea state conditions these profiles occur and study how they alter the turbulence structure of the boundary layer compared to idealized profiles.

Comparing and validating intra-farm and farm-to-farm wakes across different mesoscale and high-resolution wake models

Wind Energ. Sci., 7, 1069–1091, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1069-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1069-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Wind turbines extract kinetic energy from the flow to create electricity. This induces a wake of reduced wind speed downstream of a turbine and consequently downstream of a wind farm. Different types of numerical models have been developed to calculate this effect. In this study, we compared models of different complexity, together with measurements over two wind farms. We found that higher-fidelity models perform better and the considered rapid models cannot fully capture the wake effect.

Short summary

Short summary

We present the first Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) dedicated products over the Baltic Sea (ESA Baltic+ Salinity Dynamics). The Baltic+ L3 product covers 9 days in a 0.25° grid. The Baltic+ L4 is derived by merging L3 SSS with sea surface temperature information, giving a daily product in a 0.05° grid. The accuracy of L3 is 0.7–0.8 and 0.4 psu for the L4. Baltic+ products have shown to be useful, covering spatiotemporal data gaps and for validating numerical models.

Evaluation of Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent in CMIP6 models during 1982â2014

Short summary

Short summary

We analyze state-of-the-art climate modelsâ ability to describe snow mass and whether biases in modeled temperature or precipitation can explain the discrepancies in snow mass. In winter, biases in precipitation are the main factor affecting snow mass, while in spring, biases in temperature becomes more important, which is an expected result. However, temperature or precipitation cannot explain all snow mass discrepancies. Other factors, such as modelsâ structural errors, are also significant.

Short summary

Short summary

Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge about the effects of global warming on past and future changes in the climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere.

Correlation of wind waves and sea level variations on the coast of the seasonally ice-covered Gulf of Finland

Milla M. Johansson, Jan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Ulpu Leijala, and Kimmo K. Kahma

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 813–829, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-813-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-813-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

We analysed the correlation of sea level and wind waves at a coastal location in the Gulf of Finland using tide gauge data, wave measurements, and wave simulations. The correlation was positive for southwesterly winds and negative for northeasterly winds. Probabilities of high total water levels (sea level + wave crest) are underestimated if sea level and waves are considered independent. Suitably chosen copula functions can account for the dependence.

Short summary

Short summary

We evaluate the skill of a regional climate model, HARMONIE-Climate, to capture the present-day characteristics of heavy precipitation in the Nordic region and investigate the added value provided by a convection-permitting model version. The higher model resolution improves the representation of hourly heavy- and extreme-precipitation events and their diurnal cycle. The results indicate the benefits of convection-permitting models for constructing climate change projections over the region.

Short summary

Short summary

In addition to environmental pressures such as eutrophication, overfishing and contaminants, climate change is believed to have an important impact on the marine environment in the future, and marine management should consider the related risks. Hence, we have compared and assessed available scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea and found considerable uncertainties of the projections caused by the underlying assumptions and model biases, in particular for the water and biogeochemical cycles.

Atmospheric regional climate projections for the Baltic Sea region until 2100

Short summary

Short summary

The Baltic Sea Region is very sensitive to climate change, whose impacts could easily exacerbate biodiversity stress from society and eutrophication of the Baltic Sea. Therefore, there has been a focus on estimations of future climate change and its impacts in recent research. Models show a strong warming, in particular in the north in winter. Precipitation is projected to increase in the whole region apart from the south during summer. New results improve estimates of future climate change.

Refined estimates of water transport through the Ã landÂ Sea in the Baltic Sea

Ocean Sci., 18, 89–108, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-18-89-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-18-89-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Water exchange through the Ã land Sea (in the Baltic Sea) affects the conditions in the neighbouring Gulf of Bothnia. Pathways and variability of flows were studied with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Our analysis showed a northward transport in the deep layer and net transport towards the south in the surface layer. While on the southern edge of the Ã land Sea the primary route of deep-water exchange is through LÃ¥gskÃ¤r Deep, some deep water still bypasses it to the Ã land Sea.

Short summary

Short summary

As part of the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports (BEAR), we present an inventory and discussion of different human-induced factors and processes affecting the environment of the Baltic Sea region and their interrelations. Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities, others are completely human-induced, and they are all interrelated to different degrees. The findings from this study can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world.

Swell hindcast statistics for the Baltic Sea

Short summary

Short summary

Waves that travel faster than the wind are called swell. Our study presents wave model statistics of swell waves in the Baltic Sea, since such statistics have not yet been reliably compiled. Our results confirm that long, high, and persistent swell is absent in the Baltic Sea. We found that the dependency between swell and wind waves differs in the open sea compared to nearshore areas. These distinctions are important for studies on how waves interact with the atmosphere and the sea floor.

Characteristics of joint heavy precipitation and high sea level events on the Finnish coast in 1961–2020

Revised manuscript not accepted

Short summary

Short summary

Using sea level and precipitation observations, we analysed the meteorological characteristics of days when heavy precipitation and high sea level occur simultaneously in Finland. We found that around 5 % of all heavy precipitation and high sea level events on the Finnish coast are so called compound events when they both occur simultaneously, and these events were associated with close passages of mid-latitude cyclones. Our results act as a basis for compound flooding research in Finland.

Short summary

Short summary

We estimate the daily mass balance and its components (surface, marine, and basal mass balance) for the Greenland ice sheet. Our time series begins in 1840 and has annual resolution through 1985 and then daily from 1986 through next week. Results are operational (updated daily) and provided for the entire ice sheet or by commonly used regions or sectors. This is the first input–output mass balance estimate to include the basal mass balance.

Strength and Challenges of global model MPAS with regional mesh refinement for mid-latitude storm forecasting: a case study

Marc Imberger, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, and Neil Davis

Adv. Geosci., 56, 77–87, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-56-77-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-56-77-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Events like mid-latitude storms with their high winds have an impact on wind energy production and forecasting of such events is crucial. This study investigates the capabilities of a global weather prediction model MPAS and looks at how key parameters like storm intensity, arrival time and duration are represented compared to measurements and traditional methods. It is found that storm intensity is represented well while model drifts negatively influence estimation of arrival time and duration.

Coupled regional Earth system modeling in the Baltic Sea region

Short summary

Short summary

Regional climate studies are typically pursued by single Earth system component models (e.g., ocean models and atmosphere models). These models are driven by prescribed data which hamper the simulation of feedbacks between Earth system components. To overcome this, models were developed that interactively couple model components and allow an adequate simulation of Earth system interactions important for climate. This article reviews recent developments of such models for the Baltic Sea region.

Short summary

Short summary

We present Nemo-Nordic 2.0, a novel operational marine model for the Baltic Sea. The model covers the Baltic Sea and the North Sea with approximately 1 nmi resolution. We validate the model's performance against sea level, water temperature, and salinity observations, as well as sea ice charts. The skill analysis demonstrates that Nemo-Nordic 2.0 can reproduce the hydrographic features of the Baltic Sea.

Cyanobacteria net community production in the Baltic Sea as inferred from profiling pCO2 measurements

Biogeosciences, 18, 4889–4917, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Based on profiling pCO2 measurements from a field campaign, we quantify the biomass production of a cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic Sea, the export of which would foster deep water deoxygenation. We further demonstrate how this biomass production can be accurately reconstructed from long-term surface measurements made on cargo vessels in combination with modelled temperature profiles. This approach enables a better understanding of a severe concern for the Balticâs good environmental status.

A case study of wind farm effects using two wake parameterizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (V3.7.1) in the presence of low-level jets

Xiaoli G. LarsÃ©n and Jana Fischereit

Geosci. Model Dev., 14, 3141–3158, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3141-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3141-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

For the first time, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from the explicit wake parameterization (EWP) in WRF is examined using high-frequency measurements over a wind farm and compared with that calculated using the Fitch et al. (2012) scheme. We examined the effect of farm-induced TKE advection in connection with the Fitch scheme. Through a case study with a low-level jet (LLJ), we analyzed the key features of LLJs and raised the issue of interaction between wind farms and LLJs.

Wave height return periods from combined measurementâmodel data: a Baltic Sea case study

Jan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Sander Rikka, Victor Alari, Aarne MÃ¤nnik, Laura Tuomi, and Heidi Pettersson

Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3593–3609, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3593-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3593-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

Wave observations have a fundamental uncertainty due to the randomness of the sea state. Such scatter is absent in model data, and we tried two methods to best account for this difference when combining measured and modelled wave heights. The results were used to estimate how rare a 2019 storm in the Bothnian Sea was. Both methods were found to have strengths and weaknesses, but our best estimate was that, in the current climate, such a storm might on average repeat about once a century.

Short summary

Short summary

Two long-lasting high-pressure systems in summer 2018 led to heat waves over Scandinavia and an extended summer period with devastating impacts on both agriculture and human life. Using five climate model ensembles, the unique 263-year Stockholm temperature time series and a composite 150-year time series for the whole of Sweden, we found that anthropogenic climate change has strongly increased the probability of a warm summer, such as the one observed in 2018, occurring in Sweden.

Short summary

Short summary

In October 2019 the research vessel Polarstern was moored to an ice floe in order to travel with it on the 1-year-long MOSAiC journey through the Arctic. Here we provide historical context of the floe's evolution and initial state for upcoming studies. We show that the ice encountered on site was exceptionally thin and was formed on the shallow Siberian shelf. The analyses presented provide the initial state for the analysis and interpretation of upcoming biogeochemical and ecological studies.

Short summary

Short summary

Statistics of the frequency and intensity of snow bands affecting the Finnish coast during years 2000–2010 was conducted. A set of criteria for meteorological variables favoring the formation of the snow bands were applied to regional climate model (RCA4) data. We found on average three days per year with favorable conditions for coastal sea-effect snowfall. The heaviest convective snowfall events were detected most frequently over the southern coastline.

Reconstructing N2-fixing cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea beyond observations using 6- and 7-methylheptadecane in sediments as specific biomarkers

Biogeosciences, 17, 2579–2591, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2579-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2579-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

Cyanobacterial blooms represent a threat to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, causing deoxygenation of the bottom water. In order to understand the natural versus anthropogenic factors driving these blooms, it is necessary to study long-term trends beyond observations. We have produced a record of cyanobacterial blooms since 1860 using organic molecules (biomarkers) preserved in sediments. Cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea are likely mainly related to temperature variability.

The impact of regional climate model formulation and resolution on simulated precipitation in Africa

Earth Syst. Dynam., 11, 377–394, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-377-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-377-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

Regional Climate Models constitute a downscaling tool to provide high-resolution data for impact and adaptation studies. However, there is no unique definition of the added value of downscaling as it depends on many factors. We investigate the impact of spatial resolution and model formulation on downscaled rainfall in Africa. Our results show that improvements in downscaled rainfall compared to the driving reanalysis are often related to model formulation and not always to higher resolution.

Short summary

Short summary

A new regional climate modelling system, HCLIM38, is presented and shown to be applicable in different regions ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. The main focus is on climate simulations at horizontal resolutions between 1 and 4 km, the so-called convection-permitting scales, even though the model can also be used at coarser resolutions. The benefits of simulating climate at convection-permitting scales are shown and are particularly evident for climate extremes.

Short summary

Short summary

This study provides rigorous and detailed econometric estimates of damage costs for residential buildings resulting from a storm surge in Denmark, December 2013. Our results indicate that the isolated effect of inundation depth on damage costs is highly sensitive to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling for spatial effects, such as the level of emergency services and socio-economic conditions.

Nocturnal boundary layer turbulence regimes analysis during the BLLAST campaign

JesÃºs Yus-DÃ­ez, Mireia Udina, Maria Rosa Soler, Marie Lothon, Erik Nilsson, Joan Bech, and Jielun Sun

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 9495–9514, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9495-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9495-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

This study helps improve the understanding of the turbulence description and the interactions occurring in the lower part of the boundary layer. It is carried out at an orographically influenced site close to the Pyrenees to explore the hockey-stick transition (HOST) theory. HOST is seen to be strongly dependent on both the meteorological conditions and the orographic features. Examples of intermittent turbulence events that lead to transitions between the turbulence regimes are also identified.

Ocean Sci., 15, 361–377, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-361-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-361-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

Ocean surface waves generated by wind and dissipated by white capping are two important physics processes for numerical wave simulations. In this study, a new pair of windâwave generation and dissipation source functions is implemented in the wave model SWAN, and it shows better performance in real wave simulations during two North Sea storms. The new source functions can be further used in other wave models for both academic and engineering purposes.

Communicating the amount of windstorm induced forest damage by the maximum wind gust speed in Finland

Hannu Valta, Ilari Lehtonen, Terhi K. Laurila, Ari VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Mikko Laapas, and Hilppa Gregow

Adv. Sci. Res., 16, 31–37, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-16-31-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-16-31-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

A comparison of forest damage with windstorm intensity in Finland suggests that the volume of forest damage follows approximately a power relation as a function of wind gust speed with a power of ~10. This tentative estimate holds for typical windstorms having mainly westerly winds and affecting large areas in southern and central parts of Finland. The estimate can be utilized when preparing impact-based predictions of windstorms.

Projected decrease in wintertime bearing capacity on different forest and soil types in Finland under a warming climate

Short summary

Short summary

Wintertime bearing capacity on different forest soils with respect to timber harvesting in the projected future climate of Finland was estimated by using a soil temperature model and a wide set of downscaled climate model simulations. The results indicate that, particularly, drained peatlands may virtually lack soil frost over large areas in most of winters during the late 21st century. There is thus a clear need to develop new sustainable and efficient logging practices for peatland forests.

Short summary

Short summary

Nemo-Nordic is a regional ocean model based on a community code (NEMO). It covers the Baltic and the North Sea area and is used as a forecast model by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. It is also used as a research tool by scientists of several countries to study, for example, the effects of climate change on the Baltic and North seas. Using such a model permits us to understand key processes in this coastal ecosystem and how such processes will change in a future climate.

Short summary

Short summary

The understanding of surface water methane production in the world oceans is still poor. By combining field studies and incubation experiments, our investigations suggest that zooplankton contributes to subthermocline methane enrichments in the central Baltic Sea by methane production within the digestive tract of copepods and/or by methane production through release of methane precursor substances into the surrounding water, followed by microbial degradation to methane.

Short summary

Short summary

We quantify the sea ice thickness variability in the Bay of Bothnia using various observational data sets. For the first time we use helicopter and shipborne electromagnetic soundings to study changes in drift ice of the Bay of Bothnia. Our results show that the interannual variability of ice thickness is larger in the drift ice zone than in the fast ice zone. Furthermore, the mean thickness of heavily ridged ice near the coast can be several times larger than that of fast ice.

Short summary

Short summary

Measurements of sub-daily (e.g. hourly) rainfall totals are essential if we are to understand short, intense bursts of rainfall that cause flash floods. We might expect the intensity of such events to increase in a warming climate but these are poorly realised in projections of future climate change. The INTENSE project is collating a global dataset of hourly rainfall measurements and linking with new developments in climate models to understand the characteristics and causes of these events.

European climate change at global mean temperature increases of 1.5 and 2â¯Â°C above pre-industrial conditions as simulated by the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models

Short summary

Short summary

Based on high-resolution regional climate models we investigate European climate change at 1.5 and 2 Â°C of global warming compared to pre-industrial levels. Considerable near-surface warming exceeding that of the global mean is found for most of Europe, already at the lower 1.5 Â°C of warming level. Changes in precipitation and near-surface wind speed are identified. The 1.5 Â°C of warming level shows significantly less change compared to the 2 Â°C level, indicating the importance of mitigation.

The potential of using remote sensing data to estimate air–sea CO2 exchange in the Baltic Sea

GaÃ«lle Parard, Anna Rutgersson, Sindu Raj Parampil, and Anastase Alexandre Charantonis

Earth Syst. Dynam., 8, 1093–1106, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Coastal environments and shelf sea represent 7.6 % of the total oceanic surface area. They are, however, biogeochemically more dynamic and probably more vulnerable to climate change than the open ocean. Whatever the responses of the open ocean to climate change, they will propagate to the coastal ocean. We used the self-organizing multiple linear output (SOMLO) method to estimate the ocean surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea from remotely sensed measurements and we estimated the air–sea CO2 flux.

Impacts of climate change on extreme floods in Finland – studies using bias corrected Regional Climate Model data

Noora Veijalainen, Juho Jakkila, Taru Olsson, Leif Backman, Bertel VehvilÃ¤inen, and Jussi Kaurola

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-602,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-602, 2017

Revised manuscript not accepted

Short summary

Short summary

Climate change impacts on floods in Finland were estimated on several locations. Regional climate model data was bias corrected and then used as input of a hydrological model and the function of the bias correction was evaluated. The bias correction improved the simulation of floods, but some scenarios are still unable to match the observed hydrology adequately. The changes in floods by 2070–2099 vary in different regions in Finland depending on season and the main flood producing mechanism.

Ship emissions and the use of current air cleaning technology: contributions to air pollution and acidification in the Baltic Sea

BjÃ¶rn Claremar, Karin Haglund, and Anna Rutgersson

Earth Syst. Dynam., 8, 901–919, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

Shipping is the most cost-effective option for the global transport of goods, and over 90 % of world trade is carried by sea. The shipping sector, however, contributes to emissions of pollutants into the air and water. Estimates of deposition and near-surface concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate matter originating from shipping in the Baltic Sea region have been developed for present conditions concerning traffic intensity and fuel as well as for future scenarios until 2050.

Short summary

Short summary

We studied the highest wave events in the Baltic Sea using wave measurements available since 1996. Going beyond classifying them based solely on the maximum wave height, we found that they can be divided into two groups based on, for example, the length of the storm. Two of the severest storms show different behaviour, with the most recent (in 2017) being the longest on record. We hope this more in-depth description of the storms will aid in the issuing of warnings for extreme wave conditions.

Short summary

Short summary

The Baltic Sea is seasonally ice covered with intense wintertime ship traffic and a sensitive ecosystem. Understanding the sea-ice pack is important for climate effect studies and forecasting. A NEMO-LIM3.6-based model setup for the North Sea/Baltic Sea is introduced, including a method for ice in the coastal zone. We evaluate different sea-ice parameters and overall find that the model agrees well with the observation though deformed ice is more challenging to capture.

Short summary

Short summary

A new national daily snowfall record was measured in Finland in January 2016 when it snowed 73 cm in less than a day at a small town on the western coast of Finland. The area of the most intense snowfall was very small, which is common in convective precipitation. In this work we used hourly weather radar images to identify the sea-effect snowfall case and found that a weather prediction model worked quite well in simulating the snowbands.

Estimation of the high-spatial-resolution variability in extreme wind speeds for forestry applications

Short summary

Short summary

The rapidly growing forest-based bioeconomy calls for increasing wood harvesting intensity, and an increase in thinning and a final felling area. This may increase wind damage risks at the upwind edges of new cleared felling areas and thinned stands. Efficient wind risk assessment is needed. We demonstrate a pragmatic and computationally feasible method for identifying at a high spatial resolution those locations having the highest forest wind damage risks.

Characteristics of convective snow bands along the Swedish east coast

Short summary

Short summary

Convective snow bands develop in response to a cold air outbreak from the continent over an open water surface. In the Baltic Sea region these cause intense snowfall and can cause serious problems for traffic, infrastructure and other important establishments of society. The conditions for these events to occur were characterized and the potential of using a regional modelling system was evaluated. The modelling system was used to develop statistics of these events to occur in time and space.

Short summary

Short summary

Freezing rain is a high-impact wintertime weather phenomenon. The direct damage it causes to critical infrastructure (transportation, communication and energy) and forestry can be substantial. In this work a method for estimating the occurrence of freezing rain was evaluated and used to derive the climatology. The method was able to accurately reproduce the observed, spatially aggregated annual variability. The highest frequencies of freezing rain were found in eastern and central Europe.

Heavy snow loads in Finnish forests respond regionally asymmetrically to projected climate change

Short summary

Short summary

We studied the impact of projected climate change on the risk of snow-induced forest damage in Finland. Although winters are projected to become milder over the whole of Finland, our results suggest than in eastern and northern Finland the risk may increase while in southern and western parts of the country it is projected to decrease. This indicates that there is increasing need to consider the potential of snow damage in forest management in eastern and northern Finland.

Boundary-layer turbulent processes and mesoscale variability represented by numerical weather prediction models during the BLLAST campaign

Fleur Couvreux, Eric Bazile, Guylaine Canut, Yann Seity, Marie Lothon, Fabienne Lohou, FranÃ§oise Guichard, and Erik Nilsson

Short summary

Short summary

This study evaluates the ability of operational models to predict the boundary-layer turbulent processes and mesoscale variability observed during the Boundary Layer Late-Afternoon and Sunset Turbulence field campaign. The models succeed in reproducing the variability from one day to another in terms of cloud cover, temperature and boundary-layer depth. However, they exhibit some systematic biases. The high-resolution model reproduces the vertical structures better.

Turbulence kinetic energy budget during the afternoon transition â PartÂ 1: Observed surface TKE budget and boundary layer description for 10 intensive observation period days

Erik Nilsson, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, Eric Pardyjak, Larry Mahrt, and Clara Darbieu

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 8849–8872, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8849-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8849-2016, 2016

Short summary

Short summary

The evolution of near-surface turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget in the afternoon transition has been studied based on field measurements. The study shows that TKE transport is an important budget term that needs to be taken into account in modeling of TKE. A non-local parametrization of dissipation using a TKE–length scale model which takes into account of boundary layer depth also gave improved results compared to a local parametrization.

Turbulence kinetic energy budget during the afternoon transition â Part 2: AÂ simple TKE model

Short summary

Short summary

A new simple model for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget is presented for the sheared convective atmospheric boundary layer. It is used to study effects of buoyancy and shear on TKE evolution during the afternoon transition, especially near the surface. We also find a region of weak turbulence during unstable afternoon conditions below the inversion top, which we refer to as a "pre-residual layer".

Interannual variability of the midsummer drought in Central America and the connection with sea surface temperatures

Short summary

Short summary

We studied the relationship between the midsummer drought (MSD) in Central America, and the sea surface temperatures (SST) of the neighbouring ocean in interannual scales. Besides, the motivation of this study is also to provide a systematic method for forecasting the MSD period. We found that the intensity and the magnitude of the MSD shown a strong association with the contrast in the surface temperatures between the eastern tropical Pacific, and the tropical north Atlantic.

Short summary

The number of large forest fires in Finland will most likely increase during the twenty-first century in response to projected climate change. This would increase the risk that some of the fires could develop into real conflagrations which have become almost extinct in Finland due to effective fire suppression. However, our results show considerable inter-model variability, demonstrating the large uncertainty related to the rate of the projected change in forest-fire danger.

Impacts of climate change on temperature, precipitation and hydrology in Finland â studies using bias corrected Regional Climate Model data

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 3217–3238, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-3217-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-3217-2015, 2015

Short summary

Short summary

With most scenarios the DBS method used preserves the temperature and precipitation trends of the uncorrected RCM data and produces more realistic projections for mean annual and seasonal changes in discharges than the uncorrected RCM data in Finland. However, if the biases in the mean or the standard deviation of the uncorrected temperatures are large, significant biases after DBS adjustment may remain or temperature trends may change, increasing the uncertainty of climate change projections.

Short summary

Short summary

In this paper, we used combines two existing methods (i.e. self-organizing maps and multiple linear regression) to estimate the ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 in the Baltic Sea from the remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, coloured dissolved organic matter, net primary production, and mixed-layer depth. The outputs of this research have a horizontal resolution of 4km and cover the 1998â2011 period. These outputs give a monthly map of the Baltic Sea.

Short summary

Short summary

Many users of climate information are unaware of the availability of reanalysis feedback data and input observations, and uptake of feedback data is rather low. The most important factors limiting the use of this data is that the users feel that there is no easy interface to get the data or they do not find it at all. The relevant communities should invest resources to develop tools and provide training to bridge the gap between current capabilities and comprehensive exploitation of the data.

Future permafrost conditions along environmental gradients in Zackenberg, Greenland

Short summary

Short summary

The development of ground temperatures in permafrost areas is influenced by many factors varying on different spatial and temporal scales. We present numerical simulations of ground temperatures for the Zackenberg valley in NE Greenland, which take into account the spatial variability of snow depths, surface and ground properties at a scale of 10m. The ensemble of the model grid cells suggests a spatial variability of annual average ground temperatures of up to 5Â°C.

Short summary

Short summary

Snowmelt influences greatly the climatic conditions in spring. This study evaluates the timing of springtime end of snowmelt in the ECHAM5 model. A key finding is that, in much of northern Eurasia, snow disappears too early in ECHAM5, in spite of a slight cold bias in spring. This points to the need for a more comprehensive treatment of the surface energy budget. In particular, the surface temperature for the snow-covered and snow-free parts of a climate model grid cell should be separated.

Biomarkers in the stratified water column of the Landsort Deep (Baltic Sea)

Biogeosciences, 11, 7009–7023, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-7009-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-7009-2014, 2014

Short summary

Short summary

The water column of the Landsort Deep, central Baltic Sea, is stratified into an oxic, suboxic, and anoxic zone. This stratification controls the distributions of individual microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. Our study of in situ biomarkers in the Landsort Deep provides an integrated insight into the distribution of relevant compounds and describes useful tracers to reconstruct stratified water columns in the geological record.

Dynamics of the Earth system: concepts

Rate-induced tipping in natural and human systems

Short summary

Short summary

Complex systems can undergo abrupt changes or tipping points when external forcing crosses a critical level and are of increasing concern because of their severe impacts. However, tipping points can also occur when the external forcing changes too quickly without crossing any critical levels, which is very relevant for Earthâs systems and contemporary climate. We give an intuitive explanation of such rate-induced tipping and provide illustrative examples from natural and human systems.

Tracing the Snowball bifurcation of aquaplanets through time reveals a fundamental shift in critical-state dynamics

Short summary

Short summary

One limit of planetary habitability is defined by the threshold of global glaciation. If Earth cools, growing ice cover makes it brighter, leading to further cooling, since more sunlight is reflected, eventually leading to global ice cover (Snowball Earth). We study how much carbon dioxide is needed to prevent global glaciation in Earth's history given the slow increase in the Sun's brightness. We find an unexpected change in the characteristics of climate states close to the Snowball limit.

Multi-million-year cycles in modelled Î´13C as a response to astronomical forcing of organic matter fluxes

Short summary

Short summary

Records of past carbon isotopes exhibit oscillations. It is clear over very different time periods that oscillations of 400 kyr take place. Also, strong oscillations of approximately 8–9 Myr are seen over different time periods. While earlier modelling studies have been able to produce 400 kyr oscillations, none of them produced 8–9 Myr cycles. Here, we propose a simple model for the carbon cycle that is able to produce 8–9 Myr oscillations in the modelled carbon isotopes.

Short summary

Short summary

Multi-instrument records with varying signal-to-noise ratios are becoming increasingly common as legacy sensors are upgraded, and data sets are modernized. Induced changes in higher-order statistics such as the autocorrelation and variance are not always well captured by cross-calibration schemes. Here we investigate using synthetic examples how strong resulting biases can be and how they can be avoided in order to make reliable statements about changes in the resilience of a system.

Short summary

Short summary

The ExtremeX experiment was designed to unravel the contribution of processes leading to the occurrence of recent weather and climate extremes. Global climate simulations are carried out with three models. The results show that in constrained experiments, temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented, although climatological model biases remain. Further, a substantial contribution of both atmospheric circulation and soil moisture to heat extremes is identified.

Short summary

Short summary

Climate change, the loss of biodiversity and land-use change, among others, have been recognized as main human perturbations to Earth system dynamics, the so-called planetary boundaries. Effort has been made to understand how to define a safe operating space for humanity (accepted levels of these perturbations). In this work we address the problem by assessing the Earth's capacity to respond to these perturbations, a capacity that the planet is losing.

Short summary

Short summary

Global climate models suggest that droughts could worsen over the coming century. In mountain basins with glaciers, glacial runoff can ease droughts, but glaciers are retreating worldwide. We analyzed how one measure of drought conditions changes when accounting for glacial runoff that changes over time. Surprisingly, we found that glacial runoff can continue to buffer drought throughout the 21st century in most cases, even as the total amount of runoff declines.

Short summary

Short summary

Reconstruction and explanation of past climate evolution using proxy records is the essence of paleoclimatology. In this study, we use dimensional analysis of a dynamical model on orbital timescales to recognize theoretical limits of such forensic inquiries. Specifically, we demonstrate that major past events could have been produced by physically dissimilar processes making the task of paleo-record attribution to a particular phenomenon fundamentally difficult if not impossible.
