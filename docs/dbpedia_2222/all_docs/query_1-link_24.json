        "text": "5 reasons why investors should look at startups in the Balkans 🇲🇰🇷🇸🇲🇪🇧🇦🇽🇰🇭🇷🇸🇮🇦🇱🇧🇬 Yesterday on the amazing event in Zurich, Jakob Modéer brought up 5 very good points on why an investor should look at startups in the Balkans: 1) Untapped potential all around due to the region having been overlooked in the past 2) Same money gives longer runways to startups due to lower running costs in the region 3) Founders are super resilient and have been through it all, refuse to give up 4) A highly skilled workforce especially in tech 5) Countries are on the road to EU Membership Thank you Impact Hub Zürich, PurposeTech, Swiss EP - Swiss Entrepreneurship Program, Greater Zurich Area and Kickstart Innovation for hosting me in this epic innovation space in the heart of Zürich!

Reflecting on our recent OUT OF THE BOX.NRW event, we are reminded of the vital role this competition plays in shaping the startup landscape in North Rhine-Westphalia. Throughout the competition, participating startups had the chance to present themselves as founders and showcase their innovative ideas, demonstrating what true innovation looks like. Mona Neubaur, Minister for Economic Affairs of the State of North Rhine Westphalia (Ministerium für Wirtschaft, Industrie, Klimaschutz und Energie des Landes NRW) said: “With a great deal of courage, technological know-how, and unconventional thinking, founders in North Rhine-Westphalia are driving the digital and climate-neutral transformation forward. We honor this tremendous commitment with the state award OUT OF THE BOX.NRW, highlighting the immense innovative power of the NRW startup scene. The winners of #OOTBNRW demonstrate how startups with forward-looking digital and sustainable business models can be successful in North Rhine-Westphalia and beyond.” Dominik Gross said: “Without startups, Germany's economy has no promising future. Only through technology transfer from local startups can our companies remain world-class. NRW is the fastest-growing startup ecosystem in Germany. The \"Top 24 of 2024\" list already shows how diverse the potential is. We are particularly proud that the best startup in NRW comes from our region, OWL.” This years winner, Albert Gorlick from Synctive, said: “Starting a business in NRW, especially in the Bielefeld region, is unique. Our target group is the mechanical engineering sector. If we do it right, the first 100 customers are right on our doorstep.” Stay tuned as we will be introducing our winners in more detail over the coming weeks! #OOTBNRW #Startups #NRW #DigitalTransformation #MWIKE\n\nStepping out of our comfort zones can be intimidating, especially for us introverts. The mere thought of networking events can trigger anxiety, making it feel like navigating in unknown waters. But there is this unique blend of excitement that comes with the challenge - an anticipation of growth and new connections that could redefine our journey. Here's to navigating the delicate dance between anxiety and excitement, because it is often in those moments of vulnerability that we discover our true strengths. Introvert or not 😉 if you are in the game for innovation, growth, and disruptive ideas in Legaltech and/or B2B and visiting sTARTUp Day, let's connect and meet up. Drop me a message or comment below if you are interested in grabbing a coffee during the event. ✨ #sTARTUpDay #Networking #LegalTech #B2B #EmbraceTheChallenge\n\nExciting news awaits you at this year's Hinterland of Things Conference!

Founders Foundation gGmbH | Dominik Gross | Gabriela Pantring | Mona Neubaur #hinterlandofthings #ootbnrw #bielefeld #startuppitch #entrepreneurship #startup #pitchevent\n\n🚀 Last week, we had the pleasure of hosting our Startup Brunch at the EU HQ (Berlaymont), featuring esteemed guests Marko Kaseleht, CEO and founder of SensusQ, Erik Markus Kannike, CSO of SensusQ, and Rokas Tamošiūnas , a serial entrepreneur and investor in defense startups. Unfortunately, Dimitrios Kottas, founder of Lambda , couldn't join us due to unforeseen events. The focus of our discussion was on dual-use startups, civil-defense ventures that enhance the EU's economic competitiveness, strategic autonomy, and deterrence capabilities. Over a delightful brunch featuring Spanish delicacies like tortilla de patatas, Spanish ham, and empanada, we engaged in insightful discussions on dual-use startups. Here are my 5 key takeaways: 1. Fragmented Market: EU defense procurers prefer local startups, posing a challenge for cross-border sales. Founders are finding innovative solutions, like partnering with local entities to navigate this issue. 2. Potential for Defense Buyers: Technology's role in enhancing deterrence was emphasized. The book “Unit X” by Raj M Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff illustrates how startups can revolutionize the defense industry. 3. Ecosystem Importance: Building a dual-use startup ecosystem is crucial. While investors are organized, startups need a cohesive network. National ecosystems involving academia, corporates, the public sector, founders, and investors are the first step, followed by EU-wide connections. The “Regional Innovation Valley” initiative is a model to follow: https://europa.eu/!GD3v4N 4. Economic Competitiveness: Defense startups are branching into finance and manufacturing, showcasing their potential to boost the EU economy. 5. Beyond Funding: Initiatives like the NATO Innovation Fund and the European Defence Fund are good starts, but a well-connected ecosystem is essential for long-term success. This Startup Brunch was an enlightening experience, providing valuable insights into the burgeoning field of dual-use startups. I'm eager to connect with startups and investors in this space. Let's continue the conversation and foster innovation together! 💡 #Startups #Innovation #DualUse #EUeconomy #Defense #StrategicAutonomy #Entrepreneurship #Ecosystem #Investment\n\nThrilled to share that Ny Teknik has just unveiled Sweden's Best 33 Startup Companies, and the spotlight is shining on innovation! 🌟 What's even more impressive?
