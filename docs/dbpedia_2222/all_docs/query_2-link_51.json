Two main trends are currently visible. First, as stated in McKinsey {\\&} Company's Global Media Report, consumers continuously shift from spending on traditional media products towards rapidly-increasing spending on digital services and media products -- consumer patterns have rapidly changed. Second, as stated in Gartner's reports about the media industry, spending on IT services in the media industry increases gradually, and as a whole, the media industry is the third-largest spender on IT, after banking/finance and manufacturing. Third, as reported by both authors in their works, several facets of the media industry have undergone extreme changes, including business models, declining revenue, content models, management, economics and public funding. The aim of this study is to investigate research work related to IS in the media industry, in particular in the management and economic areas. To conduct this study, we investigated a large corpus of studies that have been contributed to IS research within the Association for Information Systems (AIS) within the past decades. We utilised advanced text mining methods to identify contributions and thematic areas. Our results clearly indicate that there is a significant downward trend of research works dealing with media industry aspects. This trend was a surprise to us, as it contradicts the emergence of new digital technologies which became key drivers in the media industry after 2009. We conclude this article by giving research directions, illustrating the opportunities and importance of investigating media industries within the context of IS, and introducing the research field of Information Systems in the eMedia Industry.}, file = {:Lugmayr2017_EM_Review of Information Systems Research for Media Industry Recent Advances, Challenges, and Introduction of Information Systems Research in the Media Industry.pdf:PDF}, journal = {Electronic Markets}, year = {2017}, }\n\nArtur Lugmayr.

The reasons people tell stories are manifold: to entertain, to transfer knowledge between generations, to maintain cultural heritage, or to warn others of dangers. With the emergence of the digitisation of media, many new possibilities to tell stories in serious and non-entertainment contexts emerged. A very simple example is the idea of serious gaming, as in, digital games without the primary purpose of entertainment. In this paper, we introduce the term serious storytelling as a new potential media genre -- defining serious storytelling as storytelling with a purpose beyond entertainment. We also put forward a review of existing potential application areas, and develop a framework for serious storytelling. We foresee several application areas for this fundamental concept, including wellbeing and health, medicine, psychology, education, ethical problem solving, e-leadership and management, qualitative journalism, serious digital games, simulations and virtual training, user experience studies, and online communication.}, doi = {10.1007/s11042-016-3865-5}, file = {[Paper]:Lugmayr2016_MTAP_Serious Storytelling.pdf:PDF}, issn = {1573-7721}, url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-016-3865-5} }\n\nKirralie Houghton, Jaz Hee-jeong Choi, and Artur Lugmayr.

Nowadays it denotes the media environment and the communication of information in ubiquitous and pervasive environments. With the addition of intelligence, the new field of semantic ambient media was established. In recent years, the field of semantic ambient media has spread its span from only a few sub-areas, such as ambient advertising, to new ones, such as ambient-assisted living ({AAL)} and health-monitoring media, significantly supported by intelligence. The study presented in this paper provides an advanced introduction to the field of semantic ambient media including the solutions for threat issues and illustration of success stories of the field. It conducts a survey of the related work and presents a thorough discussion of it. The related work is grouped according to the coverage of the principles of semantic ambient media. Based on the state-of-the-art research, the future possibilities of the field are demonstrated, especially for the ambient-assisted living, audio-visual rendering of media objects, user design principles and the society impact of the field. The paper provides ideas for impacting ambient media and directions and questions for further research. It also discusses the potential of the combination of several research studies.}, doi = {10.1007/s11042-011-0917-8}, file = {Paper:pogorelc_semantic_2012.pdf:PDF}, issn = {1380-7501, 1573-7721}, keywords = {Ambient computation, Ambient media, Ambient-assisted living, Art, Artificial intelligence, Computer Communication Networks, context awareness, Data mining, Data Structures, Cryptology and Information Theory, machine learning, Multimedia Information Systems, Pervasive computation, semantics, Special Purpose and Application-Based Systems, Ubiquitous computation, Ubiquitous media}, language = {en}, owner = {abc}, shorttitle = {Semantic ambient media}, timestamp = {2013.12.20}, type = {Journal Articles (Refereed)}, url = {http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-011-0917-8}, urldate = {2013-03-27} }\n\nArtur Lugmayr, Olli Sotamaa, Helja Franssila, and Hannu Kerkkainen.

SUOMI-nator(i) part 1 is the first part of the documentary SUOMI-nator(i) series ? a humoristic perspective on Finns, their lives and their funny situations out of the viewpoint of a foreigner. Interview partners include Janne Ahonen, Mikka Hakkinen, and Anne Makki. Finland, the country of the North is known for a good education system, its darkness, its coldness and Santa Clause. But is all this really true? How do foreigners here perceive the country? This humoristic film shows Finns in real life situations, their funny habits, and what they are proud of. Everything is seen out of the perspective of a foreigner. ?After being 8 years in Finland, and having seen many funny Finnish habits and cultural nuances, I decided to bring these on film. I saw many things change in this country towards a more international way of thinking. However, many foreigners still perceive Finnish society as closed. With this documentary series I would like to shade a bit more light on Suominatori?s way of thinking,? says the director Artur Lugmayr. Part one shades light on Finnish sisu, interaction, honesty, friendship, and nature.\n\n[Bibtex]\n\n@ELECTRONIC{LugmayrSchusterschitzSuniala2005, author = {Lugmayr, (director/producer), Artur and Schusterschitz, (director/producer), Christian and Suniala, (director of photography), Mikko}, year = {2005}, title = {{SUOMI}nator("
