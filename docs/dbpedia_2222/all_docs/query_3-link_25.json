        "text": "The craft sciences have emerged as a field of academic research in Finland, Sweden and Norway since the early 1990s. In Finland, craft research has examined various aspects of crafts using a multidisciplinary approach, adapting a range of methods from other academic disciplines according to the research topic. Another source has been the schools of domestic sciences in which craft research has been a recognized field. In Sweden and Norway, craft research has developed strongly in architectural conservation and cultural heritage with a focus on traditional craftsmanship and the performative elements of intangible cultural heritage. This article offers an overview of the developments and progress of the field of craft sciences in these countries, including its methodological approaches, with a focus on Ph.D. theses. Through mapping recurrent methodological approaches, the following categories were derived: craft reconstruction, craft interpretations, craft elicitation, craft amplification and craft socialization. The aim of the classification, and the model derived from it, is to help researchers and students understand better how different types of knowledge relate to different research methods and apply them within their own research. The purpose of the research is to create a common infrastructure for research and education in order to connect and strengthen the dispersed academic communities of craft research and to establish craft science as a formally recognized discipline within the academic system.\n\nThe papers appearing in this issue comprise the proceedings of the 1st Biennial International Conference for the Craft Sciences, held online during 4–6 May 2021, initiated by the Craft Laboratory, affiliated at the Department of Conservation, University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The Craft Laboratory was established in 2010 in cooperation with heritage organisations, craft enterprises and trade organisations, to empower craftspeople in the complex processes of making. The comprehensive agenda is to bring research into practice and involve craftspeople in the processes of inquiry. Among the operational tools are Master Classes provided for highly trained professional craftspeople in particular skills. Craft Scholarships are offered to craftspeople to investigate a problem or question in their practice, or develop ideas to improve methods or techniques. The site-specific workshop capacity in Mariestad allows craft researchers to implement research questions in practice and to perform full...\n\nTrevor Marchand – currently Professor of Social Anthropology at the School of African and Oriental Studies – has spent a long career in studying craft development, organisation and transmission in different cultures. He has conducted fieldwork with craftspeople in Yemen (minaret building and apprenticeship practices), Mali (the work of masons in Djenne) and East London where he qualified as a fine woodworker at the Building Crafts College. This collection of readings – arising out of a workshop held at Plymouth College of Art in 2013 on problem-solving in craftwork – covers a vast range of domains including glassblowing, horse training, bicycle repair work, videography, furniture and ceramic production, building conservation, dressmaking and weaving, and explores some fascinating philosophical, cultural and ethical aspects of the multi-faceted nature of craftworking in contemporary times.\n\nIn 2013, the UNESCO convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage was ratified by Finland, and its implementation has continued since. During this process, the discussions on the role of craft tradition have concerned the specific features of Finnish craft culture. One recognised aspect is the role of craft education in Finnish basic education. This article discusses the role of craft education in sustaining and developing textile craft traditions from the perspective of craft teacher education. The student teachers' portfolios from two courses were examined to determine how students applied traditional crafts and craft techniques in individual work and in teaching practices. The findings suggest that the way the students applied crafts traditions was often related to their own motivation, experiences, and ideation. Some of the topics in these two courses guided them to apply craft traditions but often it was their own choice to consider traditional aspect. Following the guidelines of the Finnish Curriculum for Basic Education, Finnish craft teacher education does not particularly focus on craft traditions. Taking the targets of safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage seriously, more effort is required when educating future teachers about craft traditions and the ways to sustain and develop them further.\n\nA report from the 2008 CHEAD Seminar, which brought together a diverse group of approximately 100 participants from the crafts, arts and design community from all regions of the UK, and from crafts higher education in particular, to explore the future of the crafts sector. The seminar generated 5 key recommendations for key organisations and individuals who work in the crafts: 1 To articulate the many values of the crafts (to individuals and society) and to promote those values in a variety of ways that will be convincing to key stakeholders outside the crafts and to the general public. 2 To raise aspirations and increase the diversity of school children who have the opportunity to study the crafts. 3 To continue to enable further and higher education students to attain high-level craft making skills and to develop appropriate business skills, so as to support their progress to employment. 4 To advocate an increase in the provision of support for craft makers as they seek to establish financially sustainable businesses that can exploit potential markets in the UK and internationally. 5 To work in partnership to determine and take actions that champion and sustain the crafts in the United Kingdom."
