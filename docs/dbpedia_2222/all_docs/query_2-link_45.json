        "text": "In 2016, the first MyData Conference took place in Helsinki, Finland, bringing together like-minded professionals and organisations from different sectors and domains. Despite “MyData” was still unknown to many, there was very strong feelings of “initiating” and “community coming together”. The natural next step was to launch the MyData Global Network in March 2017. The network served to add structure and empower the movement that grew from personal information management systems (PIMS) meetings, MyData conferences, and related activities. The MyData Network became and was succeeded by the legal entity MyData Global in 2018."
