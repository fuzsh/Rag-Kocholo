This article intends to present the notable alumni and people linked to the Aalto University and its three founding schools.\n\nIn the list are included graduates and full professors. Visiting professors have not been added and non-graduated students only in rare cases where so is stated. It is notable that before 2005 there in general were no bachelor's degrees awarded at the universities.\n\nThe university is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board, currently consisting of:[4]\n\nDr. Patrick Aebischer (President of Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL))\n\nDr. Matti Alahuhta, Chair (President of Kone Corporation)\n\nDr. Anne Brunila (Executive Vice President, Corporate Relations and Sustainability, Fortum Oyj)\n\nDr. Bengt R.

Helsinki, ERC)\n\nDr. Saku Mantere (Professor, Hanken School of Economics)\n\nDr. Anna Valtonen (Rector, Umeå Institute of Design )\n\nFormer members of the foundation board:"
