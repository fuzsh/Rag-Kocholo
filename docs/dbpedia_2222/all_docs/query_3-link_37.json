        "meta_description": "Abstract. A natural hazard is a naturally occurring extreme event that has a negative\neffect on people and society or the environment. Natural hazards may have\nsevere implications for human life and can potentially generate economic\nlosses and damage ecosystems. A better understanding of their major causes,\nprobability of occurrence, and consequences enables society to be better\nprepared to save human lives as well as to invest in adaptation options. Natural\nhazards related to climate change are identified as one of the Grand\nChallenges in the Baltic Sea region. Here, we summarize existing knowledge\nabout extreme events in the Baltic Sea region with a focus on the past\n200Â years as well as on future climate scenarios. The events considered here are\nthe major hydro-meteorological events in the region and include wind storms,\nextreme waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation,\nsea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, and drought. We\nalso address some ecological extremes and the implications of extreme events for\nsociety (phytoplankton blooms, forest fires, coastal flooding, offshore\ninfrastructure, and shipping). Significant knowledge gaps are identified,\nincluding the response of large-scale atmospheric circulation to climate\nchange and also concerning specific events, for example, the occurrence of marine\nheat waves and small-scale variability in precipitation. Suggestions for\nfuture research include the further development of high-resolution Earth system\nmodels and the potential use of methodologies for data analysis (statistical\nmethods and machine learning). With respect to the expected impacts of climate\nchange, changes are expected for sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves\nand phytoplankton blooms (increase), and cold spells and severe ice winters\n(decrease). For some extremes (drying, river flooding, and extreme waves), the\nchange depends on the area and time period studied.",

In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.\n\nSea spray emissions from the Baltic Sea: comparison of aerosol eddy covariance fluxes and chamber-simulated sea spray emissions\n\nJulika Zinke, Ernst Douglas Nilsson, Piotr Markuszewski, Paul Zieger, Eva Monica MÃ¥rtensson, Anna Rutgersson, Erik Nilsson, and Matthew Edward Salter\n\nAtmos.

To combine these two methods, we scaled the laboratory measurements to the flux measurements using three different approaches. As a result, we derived a parameterization that is dependent on wind speed and wave state for particles with diameters 0.015–10 μm. This parameterization is applicable to low-salinity waters.\n\nTechnical note: Extending sea level time series for the analysis of extremes with statistical methods and neighbouring station data\n\nKÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nOcean Sci., 20, 21–30, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal floods occur due to extreme sea levels (ESLs) which are difficult to predict because of their rarity. Long records of accurate sea levels at the local scale increase ESL predictability. Here, we apply a machine learning technique to extend sea level observation data in the past based on a neighbouring tide gauge. We compared the results with a linear model. We conclude that both models give reasonable results with a better accuracy towards the extremes for the machine learning model.\n\nInfluence of data source and copula statistics on estimates of compound extreme water levels in a river mouth environment\n\nKÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nNat.

However, it is difficult to predict flood levels during such compound events because they are rare and complex. Here, we focus on the quantification of uncertainties; and we investigate the sources of limitations while carrying out such analyses at Halmstad city (Sweden). Based on a sensitivity analysis, we emphasize that both the choice of data source and statistical methodology influence the results.\n\nOn physical mechanisms enhancing airâsea CO2 exchange\n\nLucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez-Loza, Erik Nilsson, Marcus B.

In this study, we used 9 years of in situ measurements to evaluate the temporal variability in the air–sea CO2 fluxes in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, using this long record, we assessed the effect of atmospheric and water-side mechanisms controlling the efficiency of the air–sea CO2 exchange under different wind-speed conditions.\n\nClimate change in the Baltic Sea region: a summary\n\nH.

Dynam., 13, 457–593, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-457-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-457-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge about the effects of global warming on past and future changes in the climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere.\n\nCoupled regional Earth system modeling in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMatthias GrÃ¶ger, Christian Dieterich, Jari Haapala, Ha Thi Minh Ho-Hagemann, Stefan Hagemann, Jaromir Jakacki, Wilhelm May, H. E. Markus Meier, Paul A. Miller, Anna Rutgersson, and Lichuan Wu\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 939–973, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate studies are typically pursued by single Earth system component models (e.g., ocean models and atmosphere models). These models are driven by prescribed data which hamper the simulation of feedbacks between Earth system components. To overcome this, models were developed that interactively couple model components and allow an adequate simulation of Earth system interactions important for climate. This article reviews recent developments of such models for the Baltic Sea region.\n\nCyanobacteria net community production in the Baltic Sea as inferred from profiling pCO2 measurements\n\nJens Daniel MÃ¼ller, Bernd Schneider, Ulf GrÃ¤we, Peer Fietzek, Marcus Bo Wallin, Anna Rutgersson, Norbert Wasmund, Siegfried KrÃ¼ger, and Gregor Rehder\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4889–4917, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on profiling pCO2 measurements from a field campaign, we quantify the biomass production of a cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic Sea, the export of which would foster deep water deoxygenation. We further demonstrate how this biomass production can be accurately reconstructed from long-term surface measurements made on cargo vessels in combination with modelled temperature profiles. This approach enables a better understanding of a severe concern for the Balticâs good environmental status.\n\nStatistics of sea-effect snowfall along the Finnish coastline based on regional climate model data\n\nTaru Olsson, Anna Luomaranta, Kirsti JylhÃ¤, Julia Jeworrek, Tuuli Perttula, Christian Dieterich, Lichuan Wu, Anna Rutgersson, and Antti MÃ¤kelÃ¤\n\nAdv. Sci. Res., 17, 87–104, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-17-87-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-17-87-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStatistics of the frequency and intensity of snow bands affecting the Finnish coast during years 2000–2010 was conducted. A set of criteria for meteorological variables favoring the formation of the snow bands were applied to regional climate model (RCA4) data. We found on average three days per year with favorable conditions for coastal sea-effect snowfall. The heaviest convective snowfall events were detected most frequently over the southern coastline.\n\nThe potential of using remote sensing data to estimate air–sea CO2 exchange in the Baltic Sea\n\nGaÃ«lle Parard, Anna Rutgersson, Sindu Raj Parampil, and Anastase Alexandre Charantonis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 1093–1106, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal environments and shelf sea represent 7.6 % of the total oceanic surface area. They are, however, biogeochemically more dynamic and probably more vulnerable to climate change than the open ocean. Whatever the responses of the open ocean to climate change, they will propagate to the coastal ocean. We used the self-organizing multiple linear output (SOMLO) method to estimate the ocean surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea from remotely sensed measurements and we estimated the air–sea CO2 flux.\n\nShip emissions and the use of current air cleaning technology: contributions to air pollution and acidification in the Baltic Sea\n\nBjÃ¶rn Claremar, Karin Haglund, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 901–919, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShipping is the most cost-effective option for the global transport of goods, and over 90 % of world trade is carried by sea. The shipping sector, however, contributes to emissions of pollutants into the air and water. Estimates of deposition and near-surface concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate matter originating from shipping in the Baltic Sea region have been developed for present conditions concerning traffic intensity and fuel as well as for future scenarios until 2050.\n\nCharacteristics of convective snow bands along the Swedish east coast\n\nJulia Jeworrek, Lichuan Wu, Christian Dieterich, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 163–175, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConvective snow bands develop in response to a cold air outbreak from the continent over an open water surface. In the Baltic Sea region these cause intense snowfall and can cause serious problems for traffic, infrastructure and other important establishments of society. The conditions for these events to occur were characterized and the potential of using a regional modelling system was evaluated. The modelling system was used to develop statistics of these events to occur in time and space.\n\nInterannual variability of the midsummer drought in Central America and the connection with sea surface temperatures\n\nTito Maldonado, Anna Rutgersson, Eric Alfaro, Jorge Amador, and BjÃ¶rn Claremar\n\nAdv. Geosci., 42, 35–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the relationship between the midsummer drought (MSD) in Central America, and the sea surface temperatures (SST) of the neighbouring ocean in interannual scales. Besides, the motivation of this study is also to provide a systematic method for forecasting the MSD period. We found that the intensity and the magnitude of the MSD shown a strong association with the contrast in the surface temperatures between the eastern tropical Pacific, and the tropical north Atlantic.\n\nRemote sensing the sea surface CO2 of the Baltic Sea using the SOMLO methodology\n\nG. Parard, A. A. Charantonis, and A. Rutgerson\n\nBiogeosciences, 12, 3369–3384, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-3369-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-3369-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we used combines two existing methods (i.e. self-organizing maps and multiple linear regression) to estimate the ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 in the Baltic Sea from the remotely sensed sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, coloured dissolved organic matter, net primary production, and mixed-layer depth. The outputs of this research have a horizontal resolution of 4km and cover the 1998â2011 period. These outputs give a monthly map of the Baltic Sea.\n\nComparison of floating chamber and eddy covariance measurements of lake greenhouse gas fluxes\n\nE. Podgrajsek, E. SahlÃ©e, D. Bastviken, J. Holst, A. Lindroth, L. Tranvik, and A. Rutgersson\n\nBiogeosciences, 11, 4225–4233, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-4225-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-4225-2014, 2014\n\nCurrent structure, circulation and transport in the Central Baltic Sea observed by array of moorings and gliders\n\nTaavi Liblik, Daniel Rak, Enriko Siht, Germo VÃ¤li, Johannes Karstensen, Laura Tuomi, Louise C. Biddle, Madis-Jaak Lilover, MÄris Skudra, Michael Naumann, Urmas Lips, and Volker Mohrholz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2272,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2272, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEight current meters were deployed to the seafloor across the Baltic to enhance knowledge about circulation and currents. The experiment was complemented by autonomous vehicles. Stable circulation patterns were observed at the sea when weather was steady. Strong and quite persistent currents were observed at the key passage for the deep-water renewal of the Northern Baltic Sea. Deep water renewal mostly occurs during spring and summer periods in the northern Baltic Sea.\n\nLeveraging the satellite-based climate data record CLARA-A3 to understand trends and climate regimes relevant for solar energy applications over Europe\n\nAbhay Devasthale, Sandra Andersson, Erik EngstrÃ¶m, Frank Kaspar, JÃ¶rg Trentmann, Anke Duguay-Tetzlaff, Jan Fokke Meirink, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Tomas Landelius, Manu Anna Thomas, and Karl-GÃ¶ran Karlsson\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1805,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1805, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing the satellite-based climate data record CLARA-A3 spanning 1982–2020 and ERA5 reanalysis, we present climate regimes that are favourable or unfavourable for solar energy applications. We show that the favourable climate regimes are emerging over much of Europe during spring and early summer for solar energy exploitation.\n\nFuture Changes of Compound Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers in the North Atlantic\n\nFerran Lopez-Marti, Mireia Ginesta, Davide Faranda, Anna Rutgersson, Pascal Yiou, Lichuan Wu, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExplosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers are two main drivers of extreme weather in Europe. In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.\n\nSimulating sea level extremes from synthetic low-pressure systems\n\nJani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Jani RÃ¤ihÃ¤, Mika Rantanen, and Matti KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1835–1842, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-1835-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the relationship between tracks of low-pressure systems and related sea level extremes. We perform the studies by introducing a method to simulate sea levels using synthetic low-pressure systems. We test the method using sites located along the Baltic Sea coast. We find high extremes, where the sea level extreme reaches up to 3.5 m. In addition, we add the maximal value of the mean level of the Baltic Sea (1 m), leading to a sea level of 4.5 m.\n\nA large-scale high-resolution numerical model for sea-ice fragmentation dynamics\n\nJan Ã strÃ¶m, Fredrik Robertsen, Jari Haapala, Arttu PolojÃ¤rvi, Rivo Uiboupin, and Ilja Maljutenko\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2429–2442, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2429-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2429-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe HiDEM code has been developed for analyzing the fracture and fragmentation of brittle materials and has been extensively applied to glacier calving. Here, we report on the adaptation of the code to sea-ice dynamics and breakup. The code demonstrates the capability to simulate sea-ice dynamics on a 100 km scale with an unprecedented resolution. We argue that codes of this type may become useful for improving forecasts of sea-ice dynamics.\n\nThe usefulness of Extended-Range Probabilistic Forecasts for Heat wave forecasts in Europe\n\nNatalia Korhonen, Otto HyvÃ¤rinen, Virpi Kollanus, Timo Lanki, Juha Jokisalo, Risto Kosonen, David S. Richardson, and Kirsti JylhÃ¤\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-75,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-75, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe skill of hindcasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in forecasting heat wave days (periods with the 5-day moving average temperature being above its local summer 90th percentile) over Europe 1 to 4 weeks ahead is examined. The heat wave days forecasts show potential in warning of heat risk in 1–2 weeks in advance, and enhanced accuracy in forecasting prolonged heat waves, in lead times of up to 3 weeks, when the heat wave had initiated prior to the forecast issuance.\n\nTropical cyclone low-level wind speed, shear, and veer: sensitivity to the boundary layer parametrization in the Weather Research and Forecasting model\n\nSara MÃ¼ller, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, and David Robert Verelst\n\nWind Energ. Sci., 9, 1153–1171, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-1153-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-9-1153-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTropical cyclone winds are challenging for wind turbines. We analyze a tropical cyclone before landfall in a mesoscale model. The simulated wind speeds and storm structure are sensitive to the boundary parametrization. However, independent of the boundary layer parametrization, the median change in wind speed and wind direction with height is small relative to wind turbine design standards. Strong spatial organization of wind shear and veer along the rainbands may increase wind turbine loads.\n\nModelling wind farm effects in HARMONIEâAROME (cycle 43.2.2) â Part 1: Implementation and evaluation\n\nJana Fischereit, Henrik Vedel, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Natalie E. Theeuwes, Gregor Giebel, and Eigil Kaas\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2855–2875, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2855-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2855-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWind farms impact local wind and turbulence. To incorporate these effects in weather forecasting, the explicit wake parameterization (EWP) is added to the forecasting model HARMONIE–AROME. We evaluate EWP using flight data above and downstream of wind farms, comparing it with an alternative wind farm parameterization and another weather model. Results affirm the correct implementation of EWP, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for wind farm effects in accurate weather forecasting.\n\nKilometre-scale simulations over Fennoscandia reveal a large loss of tundra due to climate warming\n\nFredrik Lagergren, Robert G. BjÃ¶rk, Camilla Andersson, Danijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Mats P. BjÃ¶rkman, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Petter Lind, David Lindstedt, Tinja Olenius, HÃ¥kan Pleijel, Gunhild Rosqvist, and Paul A. Miller\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 1093–1116, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1093-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-1093-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Fennoscandian boreal and mountain regions harbour a wide range of ecosystems sensitive to climate change. A new, highly resolved high-emission climate scenario enabled modelling of the vegetation development in this region at high resolution for the 21st century. The results show dramatic south to north and low- to high-altitude shifts of vegetation zones, especially for the open tundra environments, which will have large implications for nature conservation, reindeer husbandry and forestry.\n\nBringing it all together: Science and modelling priorities to support international climate policy\n\nColin Gareth Jones, Fanny Adloff, Ben Booth, Peter Cox, Veronika Eyring, Pierre Friedlingstein, Katja Frieler, Helene Hewitt, Hazel Jeffery, Sylvie Joussaume, Torben Koenigk, Bryan N.

Advances in these areas will increase our understanding of past and future Earth system change, including the societal and environmental impacts of this change, as well as deliver significantly improved scientific support to international climate policy, such as the 7th IPCC Assessment Report and the UNFCCC Global Stocktake under the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nSea spray emissions from the Baltic Sea: comparison of aerosol eddy covariance fluxes and chamber-simulated sea spray emissions\n\nJulika Zinke, Ernst Douglas Nilsson, Piotr Markuszewski, Paul Zieger, Eva Monica MÃ¥rtensson, Anna Rutgersson, Erik Nilsson, and Matthew Edward Salter\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1895–1918, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1895-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1895-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted two research campaigns in the Baltic Sea, during which we combined laboratory sea spray simulation experiments with flux measurements on a nearby island. To combine these two methods, we scaled the laboratory measurements to the flux measurements using three different approaches. As a result, we derived a parameterization that is dependent on wind speed and wave state for particles with diameters 0.015–10 μm. This parameterization is applicable to low-salinity waters.\n\nTransport dynamics in a complex coastal archipelago\n\nElina Miettunen, Laura Tuomi, Antti Westerlund, Hedi Kanarik, and Kai Myrberg\n\nOcean Sci., 20, 69–83, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-69-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-69-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied circulation and transports in the Archipelago Sea (in the Baltic Sea) with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Transport dynamics show different variabilities in the north and south, so no single transect can represent transport through the whole area in all cases. The net transport in the surface layer is southward and follows the alignment of the deeper channels. In the lower layer, the net transport is southward in the northern part of the area and northward in the southern part.\n\nTechnical note: Extending sea level time series for the analysis of extremes with statistical methods and neighbouring station data\n\nKÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nOcean Sci., 20, 21–30, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-20-21-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal floods occur due to extreme sea levels (ESLs) which are difficult to predict because of their rarity. Long records of accurate sea levels at the local scale increase ESL predictability. Here, we apply a machine learning technique to extend sea level observation data in the past based on a neighbouring tide gauge. We compared the results with a linear model. We conclude that both models give reasonable results with a better accuracy towards the extremes for the machine learning model.\n\nExploring extreme event attribution by using long-running meteorological observations\n\nErik Holmgren and Erik KjellstrÃ¶m\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2879, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssociating extreme weather events to changes in the climate remains difficult. We have explored how these relationships can be investigated using a more common method, and relying solely on long-running observational records of temperature and precipitation.\n\nOur results show that while both methods lead to similar conclusions for two recent weather events in Sweden, the commonly used method risks underestimating the strength of the connection between the event and changes to the climate.\n\nInfluence of data source and copula statistics on estimates of compound extreme water levels in a river mouth environment\n\nKÃ©vin Dubois, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Erik Nilsson, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-176,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-176, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBoth extreme river discharge and storm surges can interact at the coast and lead to flooding. However, it is difficult to predict flood levels during such compound events because they are rare and complex. Here, we focus on the quantification of uncertainties; and we investigate the sources of limitations while carrying out such analyses at Halmstad city (Sweden). Based on a sensitivity analysis, we emphasize that both the choice of data source and statistical methodology influence the results.\n\nEvent-based wave statistics for the Baltic Sea\n\nJan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Hedi Kanarik, Laura Tuomi, Lauri Niskanen, and Markus Kankainen\n\nState Planet Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2023-16,https://doi.org/10.5194/sp-2023-16, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for SP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTypical wave statistics don’t provide information on how often certain wave heights are exceeded and the length of such events. Our study found a strong seasonal dependence for 2.5 m and 4 m wave events in the Baltic Sea. Wave heights over 7 m occurred less than once per year. The amount of 1 m wave events can double within 20 km in nearshore areas. Our results are important for all operations at sea, including ship traffic and fish farming.\n\nDid the Bronze Age deforestation of Europe affect its climate? A regional climate model study using pollen-based land cover reconstructions\n\nGustav Strandberg, Jie Chen, Ralph Fyfe, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Johan LindstrÃ¶m, Anneli Poska, Qiong Zhang, and Marie-JosÃ© Gaillard\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1507–1530, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) on the climate around 2500 years ago is studied using reconstructions and models. The results suggest that LULCC impacted the climate in parts of Europe. Reconstructed LULCC shows up to 1.5 Â°C higher temperature in parts of Europe in some seasons. This relatively strong response implies that anthropogenic LULCC that had occurred by the late prehistoric period may have already affected the European climate by 2500 years ago.\n\nBayesian hierarchical modelling of sea-level extremes in the Finnish coastal region\n\nOlle RÃ¤ty, Marko Laine, Ulpu Leijala, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, and Milla M. Johansson\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2403–2418, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2403-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied annual maximum sea levels in the Finnish coastal region. Our aim was to better quantify the uncertainty in them compared to previous studies. Using four statistical models, we found out that hierarchical models, which shared information on sea-level extremes across Finnish tide gauges, had lower uncertainty in their results in comparison with tide-gauge-specific fits. These models also suggested that the shape of the distribution for extreme sea levels is similar on the Finnish coast.\n\nData rescue of historical wind observations in Sweden since the 1920s\n\nJohn Erik EngstrÃ¶m, Lennart Wern, Sverker HellstrÃ¶m, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, ChunlÃ¼e Zhou, Deliang Chen, and Cesar Azorin-Molina\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2259–2277, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2259-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2259-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNewly digitized wind speed observations provide data from the time period from around 1920 to the present, enveloping one full century of wind measurements. The results of this work enable the investigation of the historical variability and trends in surface wind speed in Sweden for the last century.\n\nThe role of preconditioning for extreme storm surges in the western Baltic Sea\n\nElin AndrÃ©e, Jian Su, Morten Andreas Dahl Larsen, Martin Drews, Martin Stendel, and Kristine Skovgaard Madsen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1817–1834, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1817-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen natural processes interact, they may compound each other. The combined effect can amplify extreme sea levels, such as when a storm occurs at a time when the water level is already higher than usual. We used numerical modelling of a record-breaking storm surge in 1872 to show that other prior sea-level conditions could have further worsened the outcome. Our research highlights the need to consider the physical context of extreme sea levels in measures to reduce coastal flood risk.\n\nThe Impact of Climate Change on Extreme Winds over Northern Europe According to CMIP6\n\nXiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Marc Imberger, Ãsta HannesdÃ³ttir, and Andrea N. Hahmann\n\nWind Energ. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2022-102,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2022-102, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study how climate change will impact extreme winds and choice of turbine class. We use data from 18 CMIP6 members from a historic and a future period to access the change in the extreme winds. The analysis shows an overall increase in the extreme winds in the North Sea and the southern Baltic Sea, but a decrease over the Scandinavian Peninsula and most of the Baltic Sea. The analysis is inconclusive to whether higher or lower classes of turbines will be installed in the future.\n\nOn physical mechanisms enhancing airâsea CO2 exchange\n\nLucÃ­a GutiÃ©rrez-Loza, Erik Nilsson, Marcus B. Wallin, Erik SahlÃ©e, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5645–5665, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5645-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere is an essential aspect of the global carbon cycle and is highly relevant for the Earth's climate. In this study, we used 9 years of in situ measurements to evaluate the temporal variability in the air–sea CO2 fluxes in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, using this long record, we assessed the effect of atmospheric and water-side mechanisms controlling the efficiency of the air–sea CO2 exchange under different wind-speed conditions.\n\nAdjusted spectral correction method for calculating extreme winds in tropical-cyclone-affected water areas\n\nXiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n and SÃ¸ren Ott\n\nWind Energ. Sci., 7, 2457–2468, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-2457-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-2457-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA method is developed for calculating the extreme wind in tropical-cyclone-affected water areas. The method is based on the spectral correction method that fills in the missing wind variability to the modeled time series, guided by best track data. The paper provides a detailed recipe for applying the method and the 50-year winds of equivalent 10 min temporal resolution from 10 to 150 m in several tropical-cyclone-affected regions.\n\nUse of expert elicitation to assign weights to climate and hydrological models in climate impact studies\n\nEva Sebok, Hans JÃ¸rgen Henriksen, Ernesto PastÃ©n-Zapata, Peter Berg, Guillaume Thirel, Anthony Lemoine, Andrea Lira-Loarca, Christiana Photiadou, Rafael Pimentel, Paul Royer-Gaspard, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, Jean Philippe Vidal, Philippe Lucas-Picher, Markus G. Donat, Giovanni Besio, MarÃ­a JosÃ© Polo, Simon Stisen, Yvan Caballero, Ilias G. Pechlivanidis, Lars Troldborg, and Jens Christian Refsgaard\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5605–5625, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5605-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5605-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological models projecting the impact of changing climate carry a lot of uncertainty. Thus, these models usually have a multitude of simulations using different future climate data. This study used the subjective opinion of experts to assess which climate and hydrological models are the most likely to correctly predict climate impacts, thereby easing the computational burden. The experts could select more likely hydrological models, while the climate models were deemed equally probable.\n\nPresent and future European heat wave magnitudes: climatologies, trends, and their associated uncertainties in GCM-RCM model chains\n\nChanggui Lin, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Renate Anna Irma Wilcke, and Deliang Chen\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1197–1214, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1197-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1197-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study endorses RCMs' added value on the driving GCMs in representing observed heat wave magnitudes. The future increase of heat wave magnitudes projected by GCMs is attenuated when downscaled by RCMs. Within the downscaling, uncertainties can be attributed almost equally to choice of RCMs and to the driving data associated with different GCMs. Uncertainties of GCMs in simulating heat wave magnitudes are transformed by RCMs in a complex manner rather than simply inherited.\n\nClassification and properties of non-idealized coastal wind profiles â an observational study\n\nChristoffer Hallgren, Johan Arnqvist, Erik Nilsson, Stefan Ivanell, Metodija Shapkalijevski, August Thomasson, Heidi Pettersson, and Erik SahlÃ©e\n\nWind Energ. Sci., 7, 1183–1207, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1183-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1183-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNon-idealized wind profiles with negative shear in part of the profile (e.g., low-level jets) frequently occur in coastal environments and are important to take into consideration for offshore wind power. Using observations from a coastal site in the Baltic Sea, we analyze in which meteorological and sea state conditions these profiles occur and study how they alter the turbulence structure of the boundary layer compared to idealized profiles.\n\nComparing and validating intra-farm and farm-to-farm wakes across different mesoscale and high-resolution wake models\n\nJana Fischereit, Kurt Schaldemose Hansen, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Maarten Paul van der Laan, Pierre-Elouan RÃ©thorÃ©, and Juan Pablo Murcia Leon\n\nWind Energ. Sci., 7, 1069–1091, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1069-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-7-1069-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWind turbines extract kinetic energy from the flow to create electricity. This induces a wake of reduced wind speed downstream of a turbine and consequently downstream of a wind farm. Different types of numerical models have been developed to calculate this effect. In this study, we compared models of different complexity, together with measurements over two wind farms. We found that higher-fidelity models perform better and the considered rapid models cannot fully capture the wake effect.\n\nFirst SMOS Sea Surface Salinity dedicated products over the Baltic Sea\n\nVerÃ³nica GonzÃ¡lez-Gambau, Estrella Olmedo, Antonio Turiel, Cristina GonzÃ¡lez-Haro, Aina GarcÃ­a-Espriu, Justino MartÃ­nez, Pekka Alenius, Laura Tuomi, Rafael Catany, Manuel Arias, Carolina GabarrÃ³, Nina Hoareau, Marta Umbert, Roberto Sabia, and Diego FernÃ¡ndez\n\nEarth Syst.

The Baltic+ L3 product covers 9 days in a 0.25° grid. The Baltic+ L4 is derived by merging L3 SSS with sea surface temperature information, giving a daily product in a 0.05° grid. The accuracy of L3 is 0.7–0.8 and 0.4 psu for the L4. Baltic+ products have shown to be useful, covering spatiotemporal data gaps and for validating numerical models.\n\nEvaluation of Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent in CMIP6 models during 1982â2014\n\nKerttu Kouki, Petri RÃ¤isÃ¤nen, Kari Luojus, Anna Luomaranta, and Aku RiihelÃ¤\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1007–1030, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1007-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1007-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze state-of-the-art climate modelsâ ability to describe snow mass and whether biases in modeled temperature or precipitation can explain the discrepancies in snow mass. In winter, biases in precipitation are the main factor affecting snow mass, while in spring, biases in temperature becomes more important, which is an expected result. However, temperature or precipitation cannot explain all snow mass discrepancies. Other factors, such as modelsâ structural errors, are also significant.\n\nClimate change in the Baltic Sea region: a summary\n\nH. E.

The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere.\n\nCorrelation of wind waves and sea level variations on the coast of the seasonally ice-covered Gulf of Finland\n\nMilla M. Johansson, Jan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Ulpu Leijala, and Kimmo K. Kahma\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 813–829, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-813-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-813-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed the correlation of sea level and wind waves at a coastal location in the Gulf of Finland using tide gauge data, wave measurements, and wave simulations. The correlation was positive for southwesterly winds and negative for northeasterly winds. Probabilities of high total water levels (sea level + wave crest) are underestimated if sea level and waves are considered independent. Suitably chosen copula functions can account for the dependence.\n\nCharacteristics of precipitation extremes over the Nordic region: added value of convection-permitting modeling\n\nErika MÃ©dus, Emma D. Thomassen, Danijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Petter Lind, Peter Berg, Jens H. Christensen, Ole B. Christensen, Andreas Dobler, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Jonas Olsson, and Wei Yang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

The higher model resolution improves the representation of hourly heavy- and extreme-precipitation events and their diurnal cycle. The results indicate the benefits of convection-permitting models for constructing climate change projections over the region.\n\nOceanographic regional climate projections for the Baltic Sea untilÂ 2100\n\nH. E. Markus Meier, Christian Dieterich, Matthias GrÃ¶ger, Cyril Dutheil, Florian BÃ¶rgel, Kseniia Safonova, Ole B. Christensen, and Erik KjellstrÃ¶m\n\nEarth Syst.

Hence, we have compared and assessed available scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea and found considerable uncertainties of the projections caused by the underlying assumptions and model biases, in particular for the water and biogeochemical cycles.\n\nAtmospheric regional climate projections for the Baltic Sea region until 2100\n\nOle BÃ¸ssing Christensen, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Christian Dieterich, Matthias GrÃ¶ger, and Hans Eberhard Markus Meier\n\nEarth Syst.

Therefore, there has been a focus on estimations of future climate change and its impacts in recent research. Models show a strong warming, in particular in the north in winter. Precipitation is projected to increase in the whole region apart from the south during summer. New results improve estimates of future climate change.\n\nRefined estimates of water transport through the Ã landÂ Sea in the Baltic Sea\n\nAntti Westerlund, Elina Miettunen, Laura Tuomi, and Pekka Alenius\n\nOcean Sci., 18, 89–108, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-18-89-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-18-89-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater exchange through the Ã land Sea (in the Baltic Sea) affects the conditions in the neighbouring Gulf of Bothnia. Pathways and variability of flows were studied with a high-resolution hydrodynamic model. Our analysis showed a northward transport in the deep layer and net transport towards the south in the surface layer. While on the southern edge of the Ã land Sea the primary route of deep-water exchange is through LÃ¥gskÃ¤r Deep, some deep water still bypasses it to the Ã land Sea.\n\nHuman impacts and their interactions in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMarcus Reckermann, Anders Omstedt, Tarmo Soomere, Juris Aigars, Naveed Akhtar, Magdalena BeÅdowska, Jacek BeÅdowski, Tom Cronin, MichaÅ Czub, Margit Eero, Kari Petri HyytiÃ¤inen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Anders Kiessling, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Karol KuliÅski, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, Michelle McCrackin, H.

Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities, others are completely human-induced, and they are all interrelated to different degrees. The findings from this study can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world.\n\nSwell hindcast statistics for the Baltic Sea\n\nJan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Siim PÃ¤rt, Victor Alari, Sander Rikka, Elisa Lindgren, and Laura Tuomi\n\nOcean Sci., 17, 1815–1829, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-1815-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-1815-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWaves that travel faster than the wind are called swell. Our study presents wave model statistics of swell waves in the Baltic Sea, since such statistics have not yet been reliably compiled. Our results confirm that long, high, and persistent swell is absent in the Baltic Sea. We found that the dependency between swell and wind waves differs in the open sea compared to nearshore areas. These distinctions are important for studies on how waves interact with the atmosphere and the sea floor.\n\nCharacteristics of joint heavy precipitation and high sea level events on the Finnish coast in 1961–2020\n\nMika Rantanen, Kirsti JylhÃ¤, Jani SÃ¤rkkÃ¤, Jani RÃ¤ihÃ¤, and Ulpu Leijala\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-314,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-314, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing sea level and precipitation observations, we analysed the meteorological characteristics of days when heavy precipitation and high sea level occur simultaneously in Finland. We found that around 5 % of all heavy precipitation and high sea level events on the Finnish coast are so called compound events when they both occur simultaneously, and these events were associated with close passages of mid-latitude cyclones. Our results act as a basis for compound flooding research in Finland.\n\nGreenland ice sheet mass balance from 1840 through next week\n\nKenneth D. Mankoff, Xavier Fettweis, Peter L.

Our time series begins in 1840 and has annual resolution through 1985 and then daily from 1986 through next week. Results are operational (updated daily) and provided for the entire ice sheet or by commonly used regions or sectors. This is the first input–output mass balance estimate to include the basal mass balance.\n\nStrength and Challenges of global model MPAS with regional mesh refinement for mid-latitude storm forecasting: a case study\n\nMarc Imberger, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, and Neil Davis\n\nAdv. Geosci., 56, 77–87, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-56-77-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-56-77-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEvents like mid-latitude storms with their high winds have an impact on wind energy production and forecasting of such events is crucial. This study investigates the capabilities of a global weather prediction model MPAS and looks at how key parameters like storm intensity, arrival time and duration are represented compared to measurements and traditional methods. It is found that storm intensity is represented well while model drifts negatively influence estimation of arrival time and duration.\n\nCoupled regional Earth system modeling in the Baltic Sea region\n\nMatthias GrÃ¶ger, Christian Dieterich, Jari Haapala, Ha Thi Minh Ho-Hagemann, Stefan Hagemann, Jaromir Jakacki, Wilhelm May, H. E. Markus Meier, Paul A. Miller, Anna Rutgersson, and Lichuan Wu\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 939–973, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-939-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate studies are typically pursued by single Earth system component models (e.g., ocean models and atmosphere models). These models are driven by prescribed data which hamper the simulation of feedbacks between Earth system components. To overcome this, models were developed that interactively couple model components and allow an adequate simulation of Earth system interactions important for climate. This article reviews recent developments of such models for the Baltic Sea region.\n\nNemo-Nordic 2.0: operational marine forecast model for the Baltic Sea\n\nTuomas KÃ¤rnÃ¤, Patrik Ljungemyr, Saeed Falahat, Ida Ringgaard, Lars Axell, Vasily Korabel, Jens Murawski, Ilja Maljutenko, Anja Lindenthal, Simon Jandt-Scheelke, Svetlana Verjovkina, Ina Lorkowski, Priidik Lagemaa, Jun She, Laura Tuomi, Adam Nord, and Vibeke Huess\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5731–5749, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5731-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5731-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present Nemo-Nordic 2.0, a novel operational marine model for the Baltic Sea. The model covers the Baltic Sea and the North Sea with approximately 1 nmi resolution. We validate the model's performance against sea level, water temperature, and salinity observations, as well as sea ice charts. The skill analysis demonstrates that Nemo-Nordic 2.0 can reproduce the hydrographic features of the Baltic Sea.\n\nCyanobacteria net community production in the Baltic Sea as inferred from profiling pCO2 measurements\n\nJens Daniel MÃ¼ller, Bernd Schneider, Ulf GrÃ¤we, Peer Fietzek, Marcus Bo Wallin, Anna Rutgersson, Norbert Wasmund, Siegfried KrÃ¼ger, and Gregor Rehder\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4889–4917, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on profiling pCO2 measurements from a field campaign, we quantify the biomass production of a cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic Sea, the export of which would foster deep water deoxygenation. We further demonstrate how this biomass production can be accurately reconstructed from long-term surface measurements made on cargo vessels in combination with modelled temperature profiles. This approach enables a better understanding of a severe concern for the Balticâs good environmental status.\n\nA case study of wind farm effects using two wake parameterizations in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (V3.7.1) in the presence of low-level jets\n\nXiaoli G. LarsÃ©n and Jana Fischereit\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3141–3158, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3141-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3141-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor the first time, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from the explicit wake parameterization (EWP) in WRF is examined using high-frequency measurements over a wind farm and compared with that calculated using the Fitch et al. (2012) scheme. We examined the effect of farm-induced TKE advection in connection with the Fitch scheme. Through a case study with a low-level jet (LLJ), we analyzed the key features of LLJs and raised the issue of interaction between wind farms and LLJs.\n\nWave height return periods from combined measurementâmodel data: a Baltic Sea case study\n\nJan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Sander Rikka, Victor Alari, Aarne MÃ¤nnik, Laura Tuomi, and Heidi Pettersson\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3593–3609, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3593-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3593-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWave observations have a fundamental uncertainty due to the randomness of the sea state. Such scatter is absent in model data, and we tried two methods to best account for this difference when combining measured and modelled wave heights. The results were used to estimate how rare a 2019 storm in the Bothnian Sea was. Both methods were found to have strengths and weaknesses, but our best estimate was that, in the current climate, such a storm might on average repeat about once a century.\n\nThe extremely warm summerÂ of 2018 in Sweden â set in a historical context\n\nRenate Anna Irma Wilcke, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Changgui Lin, Daniela Matei, Anders Moberg, and Evangelos Tyrlis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1107–1121, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1107-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1107-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo long-lasting high-pressure systems in summer 2018 led to heat waves over Scandinavia and an extended summer period with devastating impacts on both agriculture and human life. Using five climate model ensembles, the unique 263-year Stockholm temperature time series and a composite 150-year time series for the whole of Sweden, we found that anthropogenic climate change has strongly increased the probability of a warm summer, such as the one observed in 2018, occurring in Sweden.\n\nThe MOSAiC ice floe: sediment-laden survivor from the Siberian shelf\n\nThomas Krumpen, Florent Birrien, Frank Kauker, Thomas Rackow, Luisa von Albedyll, Michael Angelopoulos, H.

Here we provide historical context of the floe's evolution and initial state for upcoming studies. We show that the ice encountered on site was exceptionally thin and was formed on the shallow Siberian shelf. The analyses presented provide the initial state for the analysis and interpretation of upcoming biogeochemical and ecological studies.\n\nStatistics of sea-effect snowfall along the Finnish coastline based on regional climate model data\n\nTaru Olsson, Anna Luomaranta, Kirsti JylhÃ¤, Julia Jeworrek, Tuuli Perttula, Christian Dieterich, Lichuan Wu, Anna Rutgersson, and Antti MÃ¤kelÃ¤\n\nAdv.

A set of criteria for meteorological variables favoring the formation of the snow bands were applied to regional climate model (RCA4) data. We found on average three days per year with favorable conditions for coastal sea-effect snowfall. The heaviest convective snowfall events were detected most frequently over the southern coastline.\n\nReconstructing N2-fixing cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea beyond observations using 6- and 7-methylheptadecane in sediments as specific biomarkers\n\nJÃ©rÃ´me Kaiser, Norbert Wasmund, Mati Kahru, Anna K. Wittenborn, Regina Hansen, Katharina HÃ¤usler, Matthias Moros, Detlef Schulz-Bull, and Helge W. Arz\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2579–2591, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2579-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2579-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCyanobacterial blooms represent a threat to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, causing deoxygenation of the bottom water. In order to understand the natural versus anthropogenic factors driving these blooms, it is necessary to study long-term trends beyond observations. We have produced a record of cyanobacterial blooms since 1860 using organic molecules (biomarkers) preserved in sediments. Cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea are likely mainly related to temperature variability.\n\nThe impact of regional climate model formulation and resolution on simulated precipitation in Africa\n\nMinchao Wu, Grigory Nikulin, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Danijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Colin Jones, and David Lindstedt\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 377–394, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-377-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-377-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional Climate Models constitute a downscaling tool to provide high-resolution data for impact and adaptation studies. However, there is no unique definition of the added value of downscaling as it depends on many factors. We investigate the impact of spatial resolution and model formulation on downscaled rainfall in Africa. Our results show that improvements in downscaled rainfall compared to the driving reanalysis are often related to model formulation and not always to higher resolution.\n\nHCLIM38: a flexible regional climate model applicable for different climate zones from coarse to convection-permitting scales\n\nDanijel BeluÅ¡iÄ, Hylke de Vries, Andreas Dobler, Oskar Landgren, Petter Lind, David Lindstedt, Rasmus A. Pedersen, Juan Carlos SÃ¡nchez-Perrino, Erika Toivonen, Bert van Ulft, Fuxing Wang, Ulf Andrae, Yurii Batrak, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Geert Lenderink, Grigory Nikulin, Joni-Pekka PietikÃ¤inen, Ernesto RodrÃ­guez-Camino, Patrick Samuelsson, Erik van Meijgaard, and Minchao Wu\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1311–1333, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1311-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1311-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new regional climate modelling system, HCLIM38, is presented and shown to be applicable in different regions ranging from the tropics to the Arctic. The main focus is on climate simulations at horizontal resolutions between 1 and 4 km, the so-called convection-permitting scales, even though the model can also be used at coarser resolutions. The benefits of simulating climate at convection-permitting scales are shown and are particularly evident for climate extremes.\n\nBeyond the stage-damage function: Estimating the economic damage on residential buildings from storm surges\n\nLea Skraep Svenningsen, Lisa Bay, Mads Lykke Doemgaard, Kirsten Halsnaes, Per Skougaard Kaspersen, and Morten Dahl Larsen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-30,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2020-30, 2020\n\nPublication in NHESS not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides rigorous and detailed econometric estimates of damage costs for residential buildings resulting from a storm surge in Denmark, December 2013. Our results indicate that the isolated effect of inundation depth on damage costs is highly sensitive to the inclusion of other explanatory variables. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling for spatial effects, such as the level of emergency services and socio-economic conditions.\n\nNocturnal boundary layer turbulence regimes analysis during the BLLAST campaign\n\nJesÃºs Yus-DÃ­ez, Mireia Udina, Maria Rosa Soler, Marie Lothon, Erik Nilsson, Joan Bech, and Jielun Sun\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 9495–9514, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9495-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-9495-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study helps improve the understanding of the turbulence description and the interactions occurring in the lower part of the boundary layer. It is carried out at an orographically influenced site close to the Pyrenees to explore the hockey-stick transition (HOST) theory. HOST is seen to be strongly dependent on both the meteorological conditions and the orographic features. Examples of intermittent turbulence events that lead to transitions between the turbulence regimes are also identified.\n\nWave boundary layer model in SWAN revisited\n\nJianting Du, Rodolfo BolaÃ±os, Xiaoli Guo LarsÃ©n, and Mark Kelly\n\nOcean Sci., 15, 361–377, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-361-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-15-361-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOcean surface waves generated by wind and dissipated by white capping are two important physics processes for numerical wave simulations. In this study, a new pair of windâwave generation and dissipation source functions is implemented in the wave model SWAN, and it shows better performance in real wave simulations during two North Sea storms. The new source functions can be further used in other wave models for both academic and engineering purposes.\n\nCommunicating the amount of windstorm induced forest damage by the maximum wind gust speed in Finland\n\nHannu Valta, Ilari Lehtonen, Terhi K. Laurila, Ari VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Mikko Laapas, and Hilppa Gregow\n\nAdv. Sci. Res., 16, 31–37, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-16-31-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-16-31-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA comparison of forest damage with windstorm intensity in Finland suggests that the volume of forest damage follows approximately a power relation as a function of wind gust speed with a power of ~10. This tentative estimate holds for typical windstorms having mainly westerly winds and affecting large areas in southern and central parts of Finland. The estimate can be utilized when preparing impact-based predictions of windstorms.\n\nProjected decrease in wintertime bearing capacity on different forest and soil types in Finland under a warming climate\n\nIlari Lehtonen, Ari VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Matti KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen, Antti Asikainen, Juha Laitila, Perttu Anttila, and Heli Peltola\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1611–1631, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1611-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1611-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWintertime bearing capacity on different forest soils with respect to timber harvesting in the projected future climate of Finland was estimated by using a soil temperature model and a wide set of downscaled climate model simulations. The results indicate that, particularly, drained peatlands may virtually lack soil frost over large areas in most of winters during the late 21st century. There is thus a clear need to develop new sustainable and efficient logging practices for peatland forests.\n\nNemo-Nordic 1.0: a NEMO-based ocean model for the Baltic and North seas â research and operational applications\n\nRobinson Hordoir, Lars Axell, Anders HÃ¶glund, Christian Dieterich, Filippa Fransner, Matthias GrÃ¶ger, Ye Liu, Per Pemberton, Semjon Schimanke, Helen Andersson, Patrik Ljungemyr, Petter Nygren, Saeed Falahat, Adam Nord, Anette JÃ¶nsson, IrÃ©ne Lake, Kristofer DÃ¶Ã¶s, Magnus Hieronymus, Heiner Dietze, Ulrike LÃ¶ptien, Ivan Kuznetsov, Antti Westerlund, Laura Tuomi, and Jari Haapala\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 363–386, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-363-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-363-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNemo-Nordic is a regional ocean model based on a community code (NEMO). It covers the Baltic and the North Sea area and is used as a forecast model by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. It is also used as a research tool by scientists of several countries to study, for example, the effects of climate change on the Baltic and North seas. Using such a model permits us to understand key processes in this coastal ecosystem and how such processes will change in a future climate.\n\nThe European Climate Research Alliance (ECRA): Collaboration from bottom-up\n\nWinfried Hoke, Tina Swierczynski, Peter Braesicke, Karin Lochte, Len Shaffrey, Martin Drews, Hilppa Gregow, Ralf Ludwig, Jan Even Ãie Nilsen, Elisa Palazzi, Gianmaria Sannino, Lars Henrik Smedsrud, and ECRA network\n\nAdv. Geosci., 46, 1–10, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-46-1-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-46-1-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe European Climate Research Alliance is a bottom-up association of European research institutions helping to facilitate the development of climate change research, combining the capacities of national research institutions and inducing closer ties between existing national research initiatives, projects and infrastructures. This article briefly introduces the network's structure and organisation, as well as project management issues and prospects.\n\nControls on zooplankton methane production in the central Baltic Sea\n\nBeate Stawiarski, Stefan Otto, Volker Thiel, Ulf GrÃ¤we, Natalie Loick-Wilde, Anna K. Wittenborn, Stefan Schloemer, Janine WÃ¤ge, Gregor Rehder, Matthias Labrenz, Norbert Wasmund, and Oliver Schmale\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 1–16, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-1-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe understanding of surface water methane production in the world oceans is still poor. By combining field studies and incubation experiments, our investigations suggest that zooplankton contributes to subthermocline methane enrichments in the central Baltic Sea by methane production within the digestive tract of copepods and/or by methane production through release of methane precursor substances into the surrounding water, followed by microbial degradation to methane.\n\nInterannual sea ice thickness variability in the Bay of Bothnia\n\nIina Ronkainen, Jonni Lehtiranta, Mikko Lensu, Eero Rinne, Jari Haapala, and Christian Haas\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3459–3476, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3459-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3459-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify the sea ice thickness variability in the Bay of Bothnia using various observational data sets. For the first time we use helicopter and shipborne electromagnetic soundings to study changes in drift ice of the Bay of Bothnia. Our results show that the interannual variability of ice thickness is larger in the drift ice zone than in the fast ice zone. Furthermore, the mean thickness of heavily ridged ice near the coast can be several times larger than that of fast ice.\n\nThe INTENSE project: using observations and models to understand the past, present and future of sub-daily rainfall extremes\n\nStephen Blenkinsop, Hayley J. Fowler, Renaud Barbero, Steven C. Chan, Selma B. Guerreiro, Elizabeth Kendon, Geert Lenderink, Elizabeth Lewis, Xiao-Feng Li, Seth Westra, Lisa Alexander, Richard P. Allan, Peter Berg, Robert J. H. Dunn, Marie EkstrÃ¶m, Jason P. Evans, Greg Holland, Richard Jones, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Albert Klein-Tank, Dennis Lettenmaier, Vimal Mishra, Andreas F. Prein, Justin Sheffield, and Mari R. Tye\n\nAdv. Sci. Res., 15, 117–126, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-15-117-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-15-117-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of sub-daily (e.g. hourly) rainfall totals are essential if we are to understand short, intense bursts of rainfall that cause flash floods. We might expect the intensity of such events to increase in a warming climate but these are poorly realised in projections of future climate change. The INTENSE project is collating a global dataset of hourly rainfall measurements and linking with new developments in climate models to understand the characteristics and causes of these events.\n\nEuropean climate change at global mean temperature increases of 1.5 and 2â¯Â°C above pre-industrial conditions as simulated by the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models\n\nErik KjellstrÃ¶m, Grigory Nikulin, Gustav Strandberg, Ole BÃ¸ssing Christensen, Daniela Jacob, Klaus Keuler, Geert Lenderink, Erik van Meijgaard, Christoph SchÃ¤r, Samuel Somot, Silje Lund SÃ¸rland, Claas Teichmann, and Robert Vautard\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 459–478, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-459-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-459-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on high-resolution regional climate models we investigate European climate change at 1.5 and 2 Â°C of global warming compared to pre-industrial levels. Considerable near-surface warming exceeding that of the global mean is found for most of Europe, already at the lower 1.5 Â°C of warming level. Changes in precipitation and near-surface wind speed are identified. The 1.5 Â°C of warming level shows significantly less change compared to the 2 Â°C level, indicating the importance of mitigation.\n\nThe potential of using remote sensing data to estimate air–sea CO2 exchange in the Baltic Sea\n\nGaÃ«lle Parard, Anna Rutgersson, Sindu Raj Parampil, and Anastase Alexandre Charantonis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 1093–1106, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-1093-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal environments and shelf sea represent 7.6 % of the total oceanic surface area. They are, however, biogeochemically more dynamic and probably more vulnerable to climate change than the open ocean. Whatever the responses of the open ocean to climate change, they will propagate to the coastal ocean. We used the self-organizing multiple linear output (SOMLO) method to estimate the ocean surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea from remotely sensed measurements and we estimated the air–sea CO2 flux.\n\nImpacts of climate change on extreme floods in Finland – studies using bias corrected Regional Climate Model data\n\nNoora Veijalainen, Juho Jakkila, Taru Olsson, Leif Backman, Bertel VehvilÃ¤inen, and Jussi Kaurola\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-602,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2017-602, 2017\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change impacts on floods in Finland were estimated on several locations. Regional climate model data was bias corrected and then used as input of a hydrological model and the function of the bias correction was evaluated. The bias correction improved the simulation of floods, but some scenarios are still unable to match the observed hydrology adequately. The changes in floods by 2070–2099 vary in different regions in Finland depending on season and the main flood producing mechanism.\n\nShip emissions and the use of current air cleaning technology: contributions to air pollution and acidification in the Baltic Sea\n\nBjÃ¶rn Claremar, Karin Haglund, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 901–919, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-901-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShipping is the most cost-effective option for the global transport of goods, and over 90 % of world trade is carried by sea. The shipping sector, however, contributes to emissions of pollutants into the air and water. Estimates of deposition and near-surface concentrations of sulfur, nitrogen, and particulate matter originating from shipping in the Baltic Sea region have been developed for present conditions concerning traffic intensity and fuel as well as for future scenarios until 2050.\n\nBrief communication: Characteristic properties of extreme wave events observed in the northern Baltic Proper, Baltic Sea\n\nJan-Victor BjÃ¶rkqvist, Laura Tuomi, Niko Tollman, Antti Kangas, Heidi Pettersson, Riikka Marjamaa, Hannu Jokinen, and Carl Fortelius\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 17, 1653–1658, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1653-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-1653-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the highest wave events in the Baltic Sea using wave measurements available since 1996. Going beyond classifying them based solely on the maximum wave height, we found that they can be divided into two groups based on, for example, the length of the storm. Two of the severest storms show different behaviour, with the most recent (in 2017) being the longest on record. We hope this more in-depth description of the storms will aid in the issuing of warnings for extreme wave conditions.\n\nSea-ice evaluation of NEMO-Nordic 1.0: a NEMOâLIM3.6-based oceanâsea-ice model setup for the North Sea and Baltic Sea\n\nPer Pemberton, Ulrike LÃ¶ptien, Robinson Hordoir, Anders HÃ¶glund, Semjon Schimanke, Lars Axell, and Jari Haapala\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 3105–3123, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3105-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-3105-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Baltic Sea is seasonally ice covered with intense wintertime ship traffic and a sensitive ecosystem. Understanding the sea-ice pack is important for climate effect studies and forecasting. A NEMO-LIM3.6-based model setup for the North Sea/Baltic Sea is introduced, including a method for ice in the coastal zone. We evaluate different sea-ice parameters and overall find that the model agrees well with the observation though deformed ice is more challenging to capture.\n\nComparison of the impacts of urban development and climate change on exposing European cities to pluvial flooding\n\nPer Skougaard Kaspersen, Nanna HÃ¸egh Ravn, Karsten Arnbjerg-Nielsen, Henrik Madsen, and Martin Drews\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Sci. Res., 14, 231–239, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-14-231-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-14-231-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new national daily snowfall record was measured in Finland in January 2016 when it snowed 73 cm in less than a day at a small town on the western coast of Finland. The area of the most intense snowfall was very small, which is common in convective precipitation. In this work we used hourly weather radar images to identify the sea-effect snowfall case and found that a weather prediction model worked quite well in simulating the snowbands.\n\nEstimation of the high-spatial-resolution variability in extreme wind speeds for forestry applications\n\nAri VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, Mikko Laapas, Pentti Pirinen, Matti Horttanainen, Reijo HyvÃ¶nen, Ilari Lehtonen, PÃ¤ivi Junila, Meiting Hou, and Heli M. Peltola\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 529–545, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-529-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-529-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe rapidly growing forest-based bioeconomy calls for increasing wood harvesting intensity, and an increase in thinning and a final felling area. This may increase wind damage risks at the upwind edges of new cleared felling areas and thinned stands. Efficient wind risk assessment is needed. We demonstrate a pragmatic and computationally feasible method for identifying at a high spatial resolution those locations having the highest forest wind damage risks.\n\nCharacteristics of convective snow bands along the Swedish east coast\n\nJulia Jeworrek, Lichuan Wu, Christian Dieterich, and Anna Rutgersson\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 163–175, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-163-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConvective snow bands develop in response to a cold air outbreak from the continent over an open water surface. In the Baltic Sea region these cause intense snowfall and can cause serious problems for traffic, infrastructure and other important establishments of society. The conditions for these events to occur were characterized and the potential of using a regional modelling system was evaluated. The modelling system was used to develop statistics of these events to occur in time and space.\n\nA method to estimate freezing rain climatology from ERA-Interim reanalysis over Europe\n\nMatti KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen, Otto HyvÃ¤rinen, Kirsti JylhÃ¤, Andrea Vajda, Simo Neiglick, Jaakko Nuottokari, and Hilppa Gregow\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 17, 243–259, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-243-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-243-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFreezing rain is a high-impact wintertime weather phenomenon. The direct damage it causes to critical infrastructure (transportation, communication and energy) and forestry can be substantial. In this work a method for estimating the occurrence of freezing rain was evaluated and used to derive the climatology. The method was able to accurately reproduce the observed, spatially aggregated annual variability. The highest frequencies of freezing rain were found in eastern and central Europe.\n\nHeavy snow loads in Finnish forests respond regionally asymmetrically to projected climate change\n\nIlari Lehtonen, Matti KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen, Hilppa Gregow, Ari VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, and Heli Peltola\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 2259–2271, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2259-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2259-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the impact of projected climate change on the risk of snow-induced forest damage in Finland. Although winters are projected to become milder over the whole of Finland, our results suggest than in eastern and northern Finland the risk may increase while in southern and western parts of the country it is projected to decrease. This indicates that there is increasing need to consider the potential of snow damage in forest management in eastern and northern Finland.\n\nBoundary-layer turbulent processes and mesoscale variability represented by numerical weather prediction models during the BLLAST campaign\n\nFleur Couvreux, Eric Bazile, Guylaine Canut, Yann Seity, Marie Lothon, Fabienne Lohou, FranÃ§oise Guichard, and Erik Nilsson\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 8983–9002, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8983-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8983-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study evaluates the ability of operational models to predict the boundary-layer turbulent processes and mesoscale variability observed during the Boundary Layer Late-Afternoon and Sunset Turbulence field campaign. The models succeed in reproducing the variability from one day to another in terms of cloud cover, temperature and boundary-layer depth. However, they exhibit some systematic biases. The high-resolution model reproduces the vertical structures better.\n\nTurbulence kinetic energy budget during the afternoon transition â PartÂ 1: Observed surface TKE budget and boundary layer description for 10 intensive observation period days\n\nErik Nilsson, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, Eric Pardyjak, Larry Mahrt, and Clara Darbieu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 8849–8872, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8849-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8849-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evolution of near-surface turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget in the afternoon transition has been studied based on field measurements. The study shows that TKE transport is an important budget term that needs to be taken into account in modeling of TKE. A non-local parametrization of dissipation using a TKE–length scale model which takes into account of boundary layer depth also gave improved results compared to a local parametrization.\n\nTurbulence kinetic energy budget during the afternoon transition â Part 2: AÂ simple TKE model\n\nErik Nilsson, Marie Lothon, Fabienne Lohou, Eric Pardyjak, Oscar Hartogensis, and Clara Darbieu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 8873–8898, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8873-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-8873-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new simple model for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and its budget is presented for the sheared convective atmospheric boundary layer. It is used to study effects of buoyancy and shear on TKE evolution during the afternoon transition, especially near the surface. We also find a region of weak turbulence during unstable afternoon conditions below the inversion top, which we refer to as a \"pre-residual layer\".\n\nInterannual variability of the midsummer drought in Central America and the connection with sea surface temperatures\n\nTito Maldonado, Anna Rutgersson, Eric Alfaro, Jorge Amador, and BjÃ¶rn Claremar\n\nAdv. Geosci., 42, 35–50, https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/adgeo-42-35-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the relationship between the midsummer drought (MSD) in Central America, and the sea surface temperatures (SST) of the neighbouring ocean in interannual scales. Besides, the motivation of this study is also to provide a systematic method for forecasting the MSD period. We found that the intensity and the magnitude of the MSD shown a strong association with the contrast in the surface temperatures between the eastern tropical Pacific, and the tropical north Atlantic.\n\nRisk of large-scale fires in boreal forests of Finland under changing climate\n\nI. Lehtonen, A. VenÃ¤lÃ¤inen, M. KÃ¤mÃ¤rÃ¤inen, H. Peltola, and H. Gregow\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 16, 239–253, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-239-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-239-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe number of large forest fires in Finland will most likely increase during the twenty-first century in response to projected climate change. This would increase the risk that some of the fires could develop into real conflagrations which have become almost extinct in Finland due to effective fire suppression. However, our results show considerable inter-model variability, demonstrating the large uncertainty related to the rate of the projected change in forest-fire danger.\n\nImpacts of climate change on temperature, precipitation and hydrology in Finland â studies using bias corrected Regional Climate Model data\n\nT. Olsson, J. Jakkila, N. Veijalainen, L. Backman, J. Kaurola, and B. VehvilÃ¤inen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 3217–3238, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-3217-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-3217-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith most scenarios the DBS method used preserves the temperature and precipitation trends of the uncorrected RCM data and produces more realistic projections for mean annual and seasonal changes in discharges than the uncorrected RCM data in Finland. However, if the biases in the mean or the standard deviation of the uncorrected temperatures are large, significant biases after DBS adjustment may remain or temperature trends may change, increasing the uncertainty of climate change projections.\n\nRemote sensing the sea surface CO2 of the Baltic Sea using the SOMLO methodology\n\nG.

The outputs of this research have a horizontal resolution of 4km and cover the 1998â2011 period. These outputs give a monthly map of the Baltic Sea.\n\nUser awareness concerning feedback data and input observations used in reanalysis systems\n\nH. Gregow, P. Poli, H. M. MÃ¤kelÃ¤, K. JylhÃ¤, A. K. Kaiser-Weiss, A. Obregon, D. G. H. Tan, S. Kekki, and F. Kaspar\n\nAdv. Sci. Res., 12, 63–67, https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-12-63-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/asr-12-63-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany users of climate information are unaware of the availability of reanalysis feedback data and input observations, and uptake of feedback data is rather low. The most important factors limiting the use of this data is that the users feel that there is no easy interface to get the data or they do not find it at all. The relevant communities should invest resources to develop tools and provide training to bridge the gap between current capabilities and comprehensive exploitation of the data.\n\nFuture permafrost conditions along environmental gradients in Zackenberg, Greenland\n\nS. Westermann, B. Elberling, S. HÃ¸jlund Pedersen, M. Stendel, B. U. Hansen, and G. E. Liston\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 719–735, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-719-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-719-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe development of ground temperatures in permafrost areas is influenced by many factors varying on different spatial and temporal scales. We present numerical simulations of ground temperatures for the Zackenberg valley in NE Greenland, which take into account the spatial variability of snow depths, surface and ground properties at a scale of 10m. The ensemble of the model grid cells suggests a spatial variability of annual average ground temperatures of up to 5Â°C.\n\nEvaluation of North Eurasian snow-off dates in the ECHAM5.4 atmospheric general circulation model\n\nP.

Model Dev., 7, 3037–3057, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-3037-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-3037-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnowmelt influences greatly the climatic conditions in spring. This study evaluates the timing of springtime end of snowmelt in the ECHAM5 model. A key finding is that, in much of northern Eurasia, snow disappears too early in ECHAM5, in spite of a slight cold bias in spring. This points to the need for a more comprehensive treatment of the surface energy budget. In particular, the surface temperature for the snow-covered and snow-free parts of a climate model grid cell should be separated.\n\nBiomarkers in the stratified water column of the Landsort Deep (Baltic Sea)\n\nC. Berndmeyer, V. Thiel, O. Schmale, N. Wasmund, and M. Blumenberg\n\nBiogeosciences, 11, 7009–7023, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-7009-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-7009-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe water column of the Landsort Deep, central Baltic Sea, is stratified into an oxic, suboxic, and anoxic zone. This stratification controls the distributions of individual microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. Our study of in situ biomarkers in the Landsort Deep provides an integrated insight into the distribution of relevant compounds and describes useful tracers to reconstruct stratified water columns in the geological record.\n\nComparison of floating chamber and eddy covariance measurements of lake greenhouse gas fluxes\n\nE.

L. Ritchie, Hassan Alkhayuon, Peter M. Cox, and Sebastian Wieczorek\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 669–683, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-669-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-669-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nComplex systems can undergo abrupt changes or tipping points when external forcing crosses a critical level and are of increasing concern because of their severe impacts. However, tipping points can also occur when the external forcing changes too quickly without crossing any critical levels, which is very relevant for Earthâs systems and contemporary climate. We give an intuitive explanation of such rate-induced tipping and provide illustrative examples from natural and human systems.\n\nTracing the Snowball bifurcation of aquaplanets through time reveals a fundamental shift in critical-state dynamics\n\nGeorg Feulner, Mona Bukenberger, and Stefan Petri\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 533–547, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-533-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-533-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOne limit of planetary habitability is defined by the threshold of global glaciation. If Earth cools, growing ice cover makes it brighter, leading to further cooling, since more sunlight is reflected, eventually leading to global ice cover (Snowball Earth). We study how much carbon dioxide is needed to prevent global glaciation in Earth's history given the slow increase in the Sun's brightness. We find an unexpected change in the characteristics of climate states close to the Snowball limit.\n\nMulti-million-year cycles in modelled Î´13C as a response to astronomical forcing of organic matter fluxes\n\nGaÃ«lle Leloup and Didier Paillard\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 291–307, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-291-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-291-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecords of past carbon isotopes exhibit oscillations. It is clear over very different time periods that oscillations of 400 kyr take place. Also, strong oscillations of approximately 8–9 Myr are seen over different time periods. While earlier modelling studies have been able to produce 400 kyr oscillations, none of them produced 8–9 Myr cycles. Here, we propose a simple model for the carbon cycle that is able to produce 8–9 Myr oscillations in the modelled carbon isotopes.\n\nReliability of resilience estimation based on multi-instrument time series\n\nTaylor Smith, Ruxandra-Maria Zotta, Chris A. Boulton, Timothy M. Lenton, Wouter Dorigo, and Niklas Boers\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 173–183, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-173-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-173-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMulti-instrument records with varying signal-to-noise ratios are becoming increasingly common as legacy sensors are upgraded, and data sets are modernized. Induced changes in higher-order statistics such as the autocorrelation and variance are not always well captured by cross-calibration schemes. Here we investigate using synthetic examples how strong resulting biases can be and how they can be avoided in order to make reliable statements about changes in the resilience of a system.\n\nThe ExtremeX global climate model experiment: investigating thermodynamic and dynamic processes contributing to weather and climate extremes\n\nKathrin Wehrli, Fei Luo, Mathias Hauser, Hideo Shiogama, Daisuke Tokuda, Hyungjun Kim, Dim Coumou, Wilhelm May, Philippe Le Sager, Frank Selten, Olivia Martius, Robert Vautard, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst.

Global climate simulations are carried out with three models. The results show that in constrained experiments, temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented, although climatological model biases remain. Further, a substantial contribution of both atmospheric circulation and soil moisture to heat extremes is identified.\n\nESD Ideas: planetary antifragility: a new dimension in the definition of the safe operating space for humanity\n\nOliver LÃ³pez-Corona, Melanie Kolb, Elvia RamÃ­rez-Carrillo, and Jon Lovett\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1145–1155, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1145-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1145-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change, the loss of biodiversity and land-use change, among others, have been recognized as main human perturbations to Earth system dynamics, the so-called planetary boundaries. Effort has been made to understand how to define a safe operating space for humanity (accepted levels of these perturbations). In this work we address the problem by assessing the Earth's capacity to respond to these perturbations, a capacity that the planet is losing.\n\nGlacial runoff buffers droughts through the 21st century\n\nLizz Ultee, Sloan Coats, and Jonathan Mackay\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 935–959, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-935-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-935-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal climate models suggest that droughts could worsen over the coming century. In mountain basins with glaciers, glacial runoff can ease droughts, but glaciers are retreating worldwide. We analyzed how one measure of drought conditions changes when accounting for glacial runoff that changes over time. Surprisingly, we found that glacial runoff can continue to buffer drought throughout the 21st century in most cases, even as the total amount of runoff declines.\n\nInarticulate past: similarity properties of the iceâclimate system and their implications for paleo-record attribution\n\nMikhail Y. Verbitsky\n\nEarth Syst.

In this study, we use dimensional analysis of a dynamical model on orbital timescales to recognize theoretical limits of such forensic inquiries. Specifically, we demonstrate that major past events could have been produced by physically dissimilar processes making the task of paleo-record attribution to a particular phenomenon fundamentally difficult if not impossible.\n\nExtreme weather and societal impacts in the eastern Mediterranean\n\nAssaf Hochman, Francesco Marra, Gabriele Messori, Joaquim G.

Here, we provide a review of the available scientific literature, knowledge gaps and key open questions in the study of extreme weather events over the vulnerable eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nSedimentary microplankton distributions are shaped by oceanographically connected areas\n\nPeter D.
