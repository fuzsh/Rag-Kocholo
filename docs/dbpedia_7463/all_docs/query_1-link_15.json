        "text": "What does an agent do?\n\nSales agents, or sales companies, act on behalf of the producer to sell the rights to an independent film or TV drama to distributors, who then release films on different platforms (cinema, TV, DVD, Blu-ray, streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon). (An independent production is one that has not been produced by a Hollywood studio or ‘major’. Their productions are distributed by their subsidiaries worldwide instead).\n\nSales agents negotiate with the distributors, based on the sales estimates and detailed assessment of the production’s commercial value.\n\nSales agents are also responsible for promotion. They promote the films they represent at festivals and film markets, invite distributors to screenings and hold premiere parties. They assemble and organise the delivery of any physical film materials and are usually involved in developing the marketing plan.\n\nThe point at which agents get involved in a production varies. Unknown directors, who usually need an agent the most, might have to finish their film before they can find someone to take it on. In other cases, a sales agent might sell a film to a distributor as a concept, a draft script, or at the filming or post-production stage. Funding for a film is often dependent on the deals the sales agent has managed to broker at the start.\n\nSales agents are continuously acquiring new content to sell from filmmakers and they build relationships with distributors all over the world, so the job usually involves travel.\n\nRead\n\nThe Film Business Handbook\n\nWhat’s a sales agent good at?\n\nCommercial awareness: have an awareness of cultural trends, understand and predict the market both globally and within individual countries, have an eye for talent that fits this (with the ability to read scripts quickly and thoroughly)\n\nKnowledge of the film-making process: understand all aspects involved in making a film, from script to finance to post-production\n\nMarketing: be enthusiastic with strong sales skills to secure competitive deals, be able to outline the story of a film in a succinct and engaging way face-to-face, have an understanding of digital marketing and social media\n\nNetworking: establish good relationships and communicate constantly with distribution outlets and festival programmers as well as with filmmakers, use language skills to travel and embrace other cultures, have a wide knowledge of film festivals and markets\n\nNegotiation: be flexible, able to negotiate conditions, draw up contracts, understand licencing, copyright\n\nFinance: deal with figures, have the financial knowledge to make sales predictions, negotiate funding and handle a budget\n\nWho does a sales agent work with?\n\nSales agents communicate with distributors on behalf of film producers so they work closely with both of these groups. They also collaborate with other people in sales and distribution like marketing managers and publicists.\n\nHow do I become a sales agent?\n\nSales agent roles are senior positions. To become a sales agent you need to have a high level of knowledge and experience of the industry. Occasionally companies will take on film sales assistants. Another good route into sales roles is as a marketing assistant. Go to the marketing assistant profile for details on how to do this. Increasingly sales agents are also coming from backgrounds in law.\n\nAt school or college:\n\nIf you want to go to university, A-levels or Highers in business studies, economics, English, film studies or politics are useful. Or you might want to take the following Level 3 vocational qualifications:\n\nOCR Technical Diploma/Extended Diploma in Business\n\nBTEC National Diploma/Extended Diploma in Business\n\nBTEC National Diploma/Extended Diploma in Enterprise and Entrepreneurship\n\nIf you want to go straight into a job or apprenticeship, the following Level 3 vocational qualifications will equip you:\n\nAQA Foundation Technical Level Business: Marketing Communications\n\nAQA Technical Level Business: Marketing\n\nNCFE Diploma in Skills for Business: Sales and Marketing\n\nGet an apprenticeship:\n\nApprenticeships are jobs with training. They’re a great opportunity to earn while you learn. However, it can be challenging to find jobs as an apprentice with production companies as many are not able to take people on for a whole year, which is an apprenticeship requirement at the moment. It might be worth looking for a job as an apprentice in an industry that uses similar skills, such as literary agent in publishing. This could help you develop your craft and create a body of work for a portfolio that you can use to find your way into film and TV drama at a later point.\n\nThese are the relevant apprenticeships that might be available throughout the UK\n\nDigital Content Management (Level 3, 4, England)\n\nDigital marketer (Level 3, England)\n\nMarketing executive (Level 4, England)\n\nMarketing manager (Level 6, England)\n\nSales executive (Level 4, England)\n\nMarketing (Level 3, Northern Ireland)\n\nSales and Telesales (Level 3, Northern Ireland)\n\nSocial Media and Digital Marketing (Level 3, Northern Ireland)\n\nSocial Media and Digital Marketing (Level 3, 4, Wales)\n\nSales and Telesales (Level 2, 3, Wales)\n\nAdvertising and Marketing Communications (Level 4, Wales)\n\nHigher Apprenticeship in Sales (Level 5, Wales)\n\nMarketing (Level 2, 3, Wales)\n\nYou might be able to find degree-level apprenticeships through the following frameworks:\n\nBusiness to business sales professional (degree) (Level 6, England)\n\nDigital marketer integrated degree (Level 6, England)\n\nDigital Marketing (SCQF Level 8, Scotland)\n\nBefore taking any apprenticeship, check what you’ll be learning with your prospective employer and college, so you can be sure it will be giving you the skills you want. Check out What’s an apprenticeship? to learn more about apprenticeships and find an apprenticeship to learn how to find one in your region, or approach companies directly. Go to ScreenSkills information on apprenticeships for the main apprenticeship schemes in television.\n\nGet a degree:\n\nA degree in film studies, law, business studies or media and communication is a good way into this field. You would also benefit from an MBA in film production, film history or film finance. Have a look at ScreenSkills’ list of recommended courses in film and TV. We recognise courses with our ScreenSkills Select award where they offer training in the relevant software, dedicated time to building a portfolio and have strong links with the film and TV industries.\n\nTake a short course:\n\nLearn more about the process of getting a film funded to improve your knowledge of business and finance relations within the film industry.\n\nSearch the National Film and Television School short courses for training in business or marketing\n\nSearch the ScreenSkills Training, events and opportunities page to see if there is any upcoming training in Sales\n\nLook outside the industry:\n\nConsider law, finance, business, or marketing roles in any industry as work experience in film sales is highly competitive. A background in sales, business, or finance will show you have the necessary analytical skills for this role.\n\nYou might also be interested in…\n\nBeing a publicist or a marketing manager.\n\nFurther resources\n\nSales and Distribution Filmmaker Bootcamp Panel – TIFF Industry\n\nWhat does a sales agent do\n\nFilm Distributors’ Association\n\nBroadcast\n\nEmpire\n\nScreen Daily\n\nBox Office Mojo\n\nBAFTA Guru – YouTube Playlists\n\nScreenSkills resources directory"
