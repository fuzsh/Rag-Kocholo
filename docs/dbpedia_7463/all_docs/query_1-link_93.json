        "text": "The refundable tax credit for film production services, jointly administered by SODEC and Revenu Québec, is designed to stimulate job creation in Québec, primarily by encouraging foreign producers to choose Québec as a filming location.\n\nThe basis of the tax credit applies to all-spend production costs, which corresponds to the total of the qualified labour costs and the costs of qualified properties. The tax credit corresponds to 25% of the qualified expenditures incurred by an eligible corporation for services provided in Quebec for the making of an eligible production.\n\nEligible Films\n\nFor a film to be recognized as an eligible production, the following conditions must be met:\n\nThe film must belong to one of the following categories:\n\nFiction films, including films composed entirely of sketches, each derived entirely from a script and specifically designed and arranged for television;\n\nDocumentaries with a minimum duration of 30 minutes of programming or, in the case of a series, 30 minutes of programming per episode, but excluding documentaries intended for minors and virtual reality documentaries, which can be of a shorter duration.\n\nIn addition, eligible expenditures that relate to computer-aided animation and visual effects including the filming of scenes in front of a chroma-key for use in an eligible production give rise to an increase in the rate of the tax credit. This increase corresponds to an additional rate of 16% of the qualified labour cost (65% of the portion of the cost of a contract and the other costs related to the contract).\n\nTo be eligible, the minimum overall production budget must be CAD $250,000. The company must have a registered establishment in Quebec in the year of production.\n\nThe attractiveness of Quebec for co-production is undeniable: in addition to the possibility of contributions from investors, distributors, and broadcasters, Quebec producers have several tax tools and public funds to attract foreign producers.\n\nThe refundable tax credit for Québec film and television production covers labor expenditures incurred by a company that produces or co-produces a Québec film or television production.\n\nThe effective rate on the eligible estimate can reach :\n\n– between 16% and 33% for an original Quebec production\n\n– between 14% and 31% for a production adapted from a foreign format.\n\nRequirements:\n\n– A minimum of 75% of the goods and labour expenditures must be paid to companies or individuals residing in Quebec.\n\n– The eligible company must have an establishment in Quebec and be under Quebec control.\n\n– It must hold the rights to the production and, in the case of an official co-production with Canada, obtain co-production approval from Telefilm Canada.\n\n– Distribution, broadcasting, or online broadcasting in Quebec is required.\n\nFind information about the refundable tax credit for film or television co-production in Quebec through SODEC:"
