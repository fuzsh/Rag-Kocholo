        "text": "As tempting as it is to think that cases can be successfully argued by first-year associates or that pool boys and perms provide critical evidence, the reality is that most depictions of lawyers in movies make the actual professionals cringe.\n\nThe most befuddling part of these face-palm-worthy performances is that interesting court cases abound. Ultimately, portrayals of the legal profession can be fascinating and realistic. So whatâs a lawyer to watch if they donât want to spend the whole movie fielding questions about whatâs realistic or not?\n\nWe asked lawyers for their favorite legal movies and got an avalanche of answers that weâll share over time. From cinematic classics that delve into the human psyche to dramatizations of actual court cases to a goofball comedy that is actually referenced in legal briefs, hereâs our starter list of lawyer-approved legal movies.\n\nâ\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird (1961)\n\nWe might as well start with the greats â âTo Kill a Mockingbirdâ was named the greatest courtroom drama by the American Film Institute. Based on the novel by Harper Lee, the movie has Atticus Finch defend a black man against an undeserved charge in the South during the Depression.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:Â\n\nThe movie is a classic for a reason â itâs almost impossible not to be moved by certain scenes, like when people in the gallery stand in tribute as Atticus walks out of the courtroom. Prepare the Kleenex.\n\nInherit the Wind (1960)\n\nThis dramatization of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial has two talented lawyers duke it out over a Tennessee science teacher accused of teaching evolution.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:Â\n\nâBased largely on actual transcripts of the original trial, this is a deeply compelling depiction of an historic, and historically accurate, courtroom drama.â\n\nOn the Basis of Sex (2018)\n\nThis film details Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her early career as a young lawyer, focusing on her difficult battle in Moritz v. Commissioner, a tax law case that she used to set precedent for equal rights.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:Â\n\nAs one lawyer told us, âAll things RBG are wonderful.â RBGâs single-minded dedication to a cause is inspiring â it will make you remember why you entered the profession in the first place.Â\n\n12 Angry Men (1957)\n\nAnother canât-miss classic, 12 Angry Men follows a jury deliberating the case of a poor 18-year-old boy stabbing his father to death. Though none of the characters have names until the very end, and almost the entire movie takes place in one room, itâs an emotional thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nThis movie is a masterclass on group dynamics and the power of one person to change your way of thinking. One lawyer commented, âIt accurately depicts how jury rooms never follow the rules and juries are a dice roll.â\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)\n\nCurrently streaming on Netflix! Following massive protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, a group of anti-Vietnam War organizers stand accused of trying to incite a riot.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nFirst of all, Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman is a revelation. This movie is a masterful blend of serious and ridiculous â but the courtroom antics (most of which really happened!) will make you thankful for droll procedures.\n\nThe Verdict (1982)\n\nA disgraced, drunken lawyer (Paul Newman) takes on a medical malpractice case ready to settle. As he digs into the case, he realizes the matter is worth taking to court â and it just might save his career.\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nConsidered a very underrated legal movie by many, this is a classic worth watching. Apparently, Milo OâShea, who played the judge, said it was his favorite film to make.Â\n\nLincoln Lawyer (2011)\n\nA charismatic defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) who operates out of a Lincoln Town Car defends a playboy heir in a straightforward assault case. As the case progresses, he realizes the heir may have a connection to an earlier murder case â and he may be in danger. (Note: This movie is available for streaming in its entirety on YouTube)Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nFirst of all, lawyers will fully accept McConaughey as one of their own. Moreover, the movie addresses the sometimes-complicated role of a defense attorney trying to do their best by their client.Â â\n\nAnatomy of a Murder (1959)\n\nBased on a novel written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker about a case he defended, this classic has Jimmy Stewart as a small-town lawyer defending an Army Lieutenant against a murder charge using temporary insanity as a defense.\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nNominated for Best Picture, lawyers describe this as one of the more accurate trial movies (probably due to its source material â the real life trial used âirresistible impulseâ as a defense for the first time in the state since 1886). The soundtrack by Duke Ellington is a nice bonus.Â Â\n\nMy Cousin Vinny (1992)\n\nHey â they donât all have to be serious courtroom dramas! This dark comedy finds two New Yorkers accused of murder in rural Alabama. Their only hope for a defense? Their cousin, a brash, newly licensed lawyer with no trial experience.Â\n\nWhy lawyers love it:\n\nDespite this outlandish premise, the movie is...accurate? Quite a few lawyers said that the court portrayal is relatively true to life, and that it âabsolutely nailsâ being on trial â the movie has even been quoted in briefs and in court!\n\nThe Rainmaker (1997)\n\nBased on an adaptation of John Grishamâs book, \"The Rainmaker\" provides a slightly dramatized, but realistic portrayal of the initial hurdles and practical considerations encountered by lawyers transitioning from law school to courtroom practice.\n\nWhy lawyers love it:â\n\nThis movie portrays many challenges young lawyers face including ethical dilemmas and the pressure to succeed. In addition, it captures nuanced and realistic trail tactics.\n\nâ\n\nDISCO: Legal tech that feels like a cinematic experience\n\nFree up your weekends with DISCO's leading legal software (and maybe finally catch up on those legal dramas).
