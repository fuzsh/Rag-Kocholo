Get ready for a dynamic mix of genres and styles, curated to get you moving and grooving. Kicking off this summer series is the Group Sound PDX takeover on Saturday, August 10th, from noon to 5 PM. Formed in 2021, Group Sound is a community-centered DJ collective dedicated to creating inclusive, fun, and energetic dance parties. Since then they have played at various venues, festivals, and campouts in the Pacific Northwest over the past four years and are now set to bring underground sounds to the city streets.\n\nWhen asked about the event, Group Sound co-founder Guthrie Shriver shared about their love of music, public spaces, and a vision for Portland's revival:\n\n\"Supporting Portland's public spaces allows us to share our passion for music while contributing to the vibrant, inclusive atmosphere that makes this city so special. Cities like Berlin and Detroit have had major success in re-energizing their cities through music. Berlin, which just received UNESCO status for its techno scene this year, has seen major economic uplift and urban revitalization through the dance music industry. Today Berlin attracts tourists and creatives worldwide and as a result has boosted local businesses, created jobs, and transformed neglected areas into vibrant cultural hubs. We believe the dance community here can be an integral part of revitalizing Portland as well.\"\n\n-Guthrie Shriver\n\nCo-Founder, Group Sound PDX\n\nA series of diverse DJs will continue the summer series including the USB Check Collective, and disco dynamo DJ Mintz.\n\n“As a newer DJ in the PDX scene, I’ve received a lot of love and support from fellow community members. It means a lot to me to be able to give the same type of opportunities by organizing my own events. It’s also a huge bonus to be able to bring our favorite music to public spaces.\"\n\n-DJ Vino, USB Check\n\nUpcoming Dates with more to be announced!\n\nAugust 10- Group Sound 12-5 PM\n\nAugust 17- DJ Mintz 12-2 PM\n\nAugust 24- USB Check 12-5 PM\n\nPlazas as a Platform for Healing: Survivors Speak Out at NW 13th Plaza\n\nOn July 26th, FinAbility hosted its annual Speak Out event at PBOT's NW 13th Plaza, transforming the public space into a platform for healing and empowerment. Organized by survivors for survivors, this public, grassroots initiative aimed to empower survivors of domestic and sexual abuse to reclaim their stories and find community support.\n\nFinAbility, a survivor-led, BIPOC, LGBT+, women-led nonprofit based in Portland, has made significant strides in financially empowering survivors of domestic abuse. In the past year alone, FinAbility has provided trauma-informed financial education and resources to over 30,000 survivors and community members. Guided by survivor voices, FinAbility is dedicated to creating a future where everyone has the financial security to live free from abuse and thrive. With financial abuse present in 99% of domestic violence situations, the lack of financial resources is often the primary barrier preventing survivors from leaving abusive relationships.\n\nThe event began with a series of speakers, each sharing their personal journey and insights into overcoming abuse. These powerful narratives set the tone for the day, emphasizing the importance of financial independence and community support in the healing process. After the initial speakers, the floor was opened to anyone in the audience who wished to share their story. Over the course of the event, over 80 people gathered in solidarity.\n\nRecognizing that the topics discussed could be triggering, privacy booths were available onsite for confidential conversations or to simply take a breather. Various partner programs such as Rose Haven,Call To Safety, and the YMCA were present to distribute information about survivor resources. Attendees had the opportunity to visit booths, learn about available support, and connect with organizations dedicated to assisting survivors.\n\n\"When we envisioned creating Speak Out, we absolutely felt the need to have it out in the public where we can invite people from the community and all walks of life to come and speak out about domestic and sexual abuse in solidarity. We're extremely grateful to have the fellowship of PBOT and their support to access public spaces like this and get our story out.\"\n\n-Keri Daniel\n\nBoard Advisor, FinAbility\n\nThrough the many stories of tragedy, hope, and triumph, the Speak Out event was a powerful reminder of the strength and resilience of survivors. By providing a platform for sharing, understanding, and healing, FinAbility continues to foster an open community where survivors have the opportunity to reclaim their stories and build a future free from abuse.💜\n\nPlaza Ambassadors Take to the Streets\n\nIf you attend one of our many plaza events this summer, you may meet one of our Plaza Ambassadors. This new volunteer program aims to connect PBOT with the community. Plaza volunteers photograph events, engage with attendees, distribute surveys, and build connections.\n\nThis pilot program includes ten urban planning master's students from Portland State University, providing them with valuable community fieldwork experience.\n\nEach month, the Public Street Plaza team will highlight one volunteer as Ambassador of the Month. This month, we recognize Gail Chastain for her outstanding work. In July, she attended the Kaleidoscope Arts and Craft Market at Arleta Triangle Square, the Montgomery Street Painting at PSU, and assisted with pedestrian counts! Gail shared her motivation for joining the program:\n\n\"I decided to volunteer as a plaza ambassador to learn about the locations, events, and activities offered in Portland's plazas. We need to have more third spaces (places where you don’t need to spend money to exist in the place) and plazas help provide alternative gathering spaces around the city. So far it’s been really enjoyable and I look forward to visiting other plaza sites over the summer!\n\n-Gail Chastain\n\nPlaza Ambassador\n\nUpcoming Grant Opportunity for Community Partners!\n\nExciting news for community partners of the PBOT Public Street Plazas! Metro is offering Community Placemaking Grants, a fantastic opportunity to bring your creative ideas to life in our public spaces.

Last month, the Montavilla Farmer's Market hosted a special fruit pop-up at Montavilla Plaza and people had a berry good time.\n\n\"The PBOT plazas have transformed quiet streets into thriving community gathering places. A place to eat, rest, meet, and host events is key to any successful business district. Montavilla Farmers Market has utilized the Montavilla plaza for fun, neighborhood events that connect community members, increase foot traffic to the business district, and celebrates local food and farms. We couldn't do it without the availability of the street space from PBOT, the funding from Prosper Portland, and Portland Film and Events grants.\"\n\n-Lisa Hall, Executive Director\n\nMontavilla Farmer's Market\n\nDo you have a great Public Street Plaza Photo?\n\nWe'd love to feature it! Share your best PBOT Street Plaza photo with the world by tagging @PBOTinfo on Instagram, Facebook, or X (formerly Twitter).

They are great places to grab a bite to eat, relax, enjoy live music, meet up with friends, and so much more. Check out our directory to find out about plazas near you!\n\nWhat is the Portland Public Street Plaza Program?\n\nOriginally started during the Covid-19 pandemic to assist businesses and Portlanders, PBOT's Public Street Plaza program-built partnerships with community and local businesses to transform select streets into public spaces for cultural events, street fairs, pop-up markets, and more. The program uses PBOT's Livable Streets Strategy, adopted by Portland City Council in 2017 as its policy foundation to turn streets into inclusive public spaces that foster public life.\n\nWhat started as a temporary solution is now becoming a permanent fixture in our city. The Street Plaza program reflects PBOT's commitment to climate action, mobility for all, and community building by creating spaces that everyone in Portland can use and enjoy.\n\nContact Us\n\nGot a question, comment, concern, or an awesome new idea?
