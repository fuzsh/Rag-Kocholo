        "text": "Former Washougal Mayor Les Sonneson has died at the age of 98.\n\n“He was extremely kind and very considerate,” said Washougal resident Sue Conway, whose husband, Mike, served as the city of Washougal’s public works director and worked with Sonneson for many years. “He had interest in what you had to say, which is a nice (quality) in a friend. He had such integrity, and was an amazing man. We’ve lost a treasure.”\n\nSonneson, who died July 25, served as the City’s interim mayor from 1987, after the resignation of William Bright, until 1989, when Mason Smith was elected to the role. Previously, Sonneson worked as the city of Washougal’s planning commissioner for 17 years before being elected to the Washougal City Council in 1980.\n\n“I enjoyed being on the (Washougal) Planning Commission and directing the growth pattern of the physical city. I also enjoyed most of my time as a councilman and mayor,” Sonneson told The Post-Record in 2020. “I had a few problems with what I thought was incompetence in the city staff, so I angered a few people because I tried to make some changes there. Washougal had reached a point where growth had almost stopped because they were having so much trouble getting the paperwork through the system.”\n\nSonneson was an “excellent representative for the city of Washougal,” according to Conway.\n\n“Mayors come and go, different types, but Les is one that everybody respected and could count on to present a good image of the city of Washougal,” she said. “That’s hard to do, and so important for the growth of a city. If there were issues in the city, or if people wanted to talk about things, he actually listened to people and took time to process the information and gave a really good response.”\n\nSonneson was born in 1925 near Enumclaw, Washington. A member of the “Greatest Generation,” he served in the United States Army Air Corps and the United States Air Force during and after World War II.\n\nAt the conclusion of his military career, Sonneson attended Multnomah Junior College in Portland and Oregon State University, where he received a degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nSonneson and his wife, Wanda (who died in 2021 at the age of 94), moved to east Clark County in 1957, and raised three children, Steve, Cheryl and Jeff. He worked in the Central Research Division at Crown Zellerbach for 25 years, retiring in 1982 as the supervisor of engineering services.\n\nSonneson was active in the Washougal community and was a part of several community organizations and institutions, including the Boy Scouts, YMCA, Indian Guides, Jaycees and East County PEOPLE. He also served on many boards, including the Directors for Planning Association of Washington, Columbia River Economic Development Council, and C-TRAN board.\n\nHe also spent many hours supporting the Two Rivers Heritage Museum in Washougal.\n\n“There are many things we love and admire about (Les and Wanda), but the biggest has been their outlook on life,” Meghan Parthemer, the Sonnesons’ neighbor, told The Post-Record in 2020. “They are part of the Greatest Generation, who served our country, worked hard all their lives and gave back to the community. They also have great stories about their youth and travels. Les reminds us of Mark Twain — (he) always has a story to tell and a twinkle in his eye.”\n\nSonneson enjoyed gambling — he used to have a craps table in his basement to practice for visits to some of his favorite gaming establishments, such as Cal Neva Casino and Harold’s Club in Reno, Nevada."
