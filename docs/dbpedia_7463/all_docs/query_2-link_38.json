        "text": "FAQ's\n\nWhat is the purpose of an Overlay District?\n\nOverlay district regulations and design guidelines are intended to preserve special characteristics of the area or guide development in a desired direction. Overlay district regulations may establish architectural and design controls or prohibit uses that are considered to be detrimental to the character of a particular area.\n\nResidential infill overlay districts establish a maximum height for new homes or additions to homes.\n\nPOINT OF CONTACT FOR OVERLAY DISTRICTS\n\nHow do I know when to follow the overlay district regulations or to follow the regulations of the underlying zoning district?\n\nWhen there is a conflict between the standards of the overlay district regulations and the standards of the underlying district, the overlay district regulations control. If there are no overlay district regulations for a particular development characteristic, but there are standards in the underlying zoning district regulations for the same development characteristic, the standards of the underlying zoning district must be met."
