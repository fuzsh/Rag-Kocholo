        "text": "Hate speech comes in many forms. It can include hatred rooted in racism (including anti-Black, anti-Asian and anti-Indigenous racism), misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, Islamophobia and white supremacy.\n\nBoth Canada’s Criminal Code and B.C.’s Human Rights Code describe hate speech as having three main parts:\n\nIt is expressed in a public way or place\n\nIt targets a person or group of people with a protected characteristic such as race, religion or sexual orientation\n\nIt uses extreme language to express hatred towards that person or group of people because of their protected characteristic\n\nHate speech uses extreme language to describe the targeted group that is likely to expose them to detestation and vilification. Here are a few examples of what hate speech typically includes:\n\nDescribing group members as animals, subhuman or genetically inferior\n\nSuggesting group members are behind a conspiracy to gain control by plotting to destroy western civilization\n\nDenying, minimizing or celebrating past persecution or tragedies that happened to group members\n\nLabelling group members as child abusers, pedophiles or criminals who prey on children\n\nBlaming group members for problems like crime and disease\n\nCalling group members liars, cheats, criminals or any other term meant to provoke a strong reaction\n\nHate speech is not limited to the types of negative words in these examples. But these examples show how disgusting and extreme speech must be to be considered hate speech under the law.\n\nEffects of hate speech\n\nHate speech is more than offensive or hurtful; It is harmful to those who are targeted and to society at large. Hate speech tries to delegitimize and dehumanize the people who are targeted in the eyes of society. People who are victims of hate speech can often feel traumatized, excluded, unsafe, angry, or sad. It may make them so uncomfortable that they do not feel welcome in their communities.\n\nB.C.’s Human Rights Commissioner recognizes that there is a lot of speech that is hurtful and offensive that is not captured under hate speech laws.\n\nThere are other laws and policies that someone could violate if they say offensive things.\n\nUnder the Human Rights Code many acts of discrimination involve offensive speech. Whenever people use words in a way that attacks and undermines a person’s dignity in connection with their work, housing or access to public services because of personal characteristics protected by the Code, the Human Rights Tribunal could find that they have discriminated under the Code.\n\nFor example, when showing an apartment for rent to an Indigenous person, a landlord makes some negative and stereotypical comments about Indigenous people and says that “we don’t usually rent to Indigenous people but will consider your application.” The landlord never contacts the prospective tenant but they notice the apartment continues to be advertised for rent for a few weeks. The prospective tenant tries to contact the landlord but receives no response.\n\nIt is unlikely the negative and stereotypical comments the landlord made would amount to hate speech under the Human Rights Code—though that depends on the precise content and context—but they may amount to discrimination in tenancy (under section 10 of the Code).\n\nAnother example comes from the world of work. Offensive speech might violate an employer’s bullying and harassment or respectful workplace policies. Employers in B.C. must implement procedures for responding to bullying and harassment in the workplace. Bullying and harassment is any conduct that could reasonably result in another worker being humiliated or intimidated. For example, calling someone derogatory names or being verbally aggressive might be bullying and harassment. Bullying and harassment do not need to be linked to a protected characteristic like gender identity or race to be considered offensive speech.\n\nFor more information about bullying and harassment, see WorkSafeBC’s Bullying and Harassment page.\n\nKey definitions\n\nPublic incitement of hatred is a criminal offence in Canada. Someone found guilty of the offence of “public incitement of hatred” made “statements” in a “public place” with the intention of stirring up or encouraging hatred against a particular group of people. That person’s attempt to incite hate must also include the strong possibility of a public disturbance, which the law calls a “breach of the peace.”\n\nWhat the Criminal Code refers to as “statements” includes more than just spoken words or speeches. Statements can be written or recorded, and can include gestures, signs, photographs and drawings.\n\nWhat the Criminal Code means by a “public place” is an area or location that the general public normally has access to. Parks, malls and city streets are just some examples of public places.\n\nIn a nutshell, “public incitement of hatred” means that someone said something publicly that could stir up hatred (extreme language that is likely to expose a targeted group to detestation and vilification, as described under What is hate speech?). The speech doesn’t have to result in any further hateful comments or acts for someone to be convicted of the offence of “public incitement of hatred.”\n\nProcess of charging and convicting someone of public incitement of hatred\n\nThe police investigate to find evidence that this crime has been committed. It is then up to the prosecutor (called Crown Counsel) to decide if the evidence is strong enough to charge someone with public incitement of hatred and go to trial. It is then up to the judge who hears the case to decide if the accused person is guilty or not guilty.\n\nFew people have been found guilty of public incitement of hatred. Here are some examples of hate speech that led to the accused being found guilty:\n\nCaution: The following examples may be distressing to some readers.\n\nSomeone spray-painted comments—on public-transit property and parked cars—that called for violence against Syrians and Muslims.\n\nSomeone responded to a report about two imams—posted by a television station on its Facebook page—with comments about attacking the imams and destroying their race.\n\nTwo people set fire to a five-foot wooden cross in front of the home of a mixed-race couple, a Black man and a white woman, and their five children.\n\nSomeone spray-painted messages on various buildings associated with Muslims, Jews and Christians, including a Christian church led by a Black minister. The spray-painted hate speech included symbols (like swastikas), violent racial slurs and numbers linked to white-supremacist groups.\n\nKey definitions\n\nWilful promotion of hatred is a criminal offence in Canada. Wilful promotion of hatred means to make “statements” in public that wilfully or intentionally promote hate against an “identifiable group.” Unlike public incitement of hatred, wilful promotion of hatred does not have to involve a breach of the peace.\n\n“Identifiable” groups of people share a protected characteristic. The Criminal Code lists the characteristics that may apply: colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and mental or physical disability.\n\nAgain, “statements” includes more than just spoken words or speeches. Statements can be written or recorded, and they include gestures, signs, photographs and drawings.\n\nA guilty verdict for the offence of “wilful promotion of hatred” does not require proof that the speech actually caused further hateful comments or acts against the targeted group. The purpose of this law is to prevent any serious harm that may result from hate speech, including harm to the targeted group and society generally.\n\nHow is someone charged and convicted of “wilful promotion of hatred”?\n\nThe police investigate to find evidence that this crime has been committed. It is then up to the prosecutor (called Crown Counsel) to decide if the evidence is strong enough to charge someone with wilful promotion of hatred and go to trial. It is then up to the judge who hears the case to decide if the accused person is guilty or not guilty.\n\nFew people in Canada have been found guilty of wilful promotion of hatred. Here are some examples of hate speech that led to guilty verdicts:\n\nCaution: The following examples may be distressing to some readers.\n\nA high school teacher made anti-Semitic comments to his students. He told them that Jews made up the Holocaust to get sympathy and described Jews as evil.\n\nA man who described himself as a Christian pastor wrote pamphlets containing hateful comments about Muslims wanting to take over and turn Canada into a Muslim country. He distributed the pamphlets near a local high school attended by Muslim students.\n\nA man posted hate speech on various websites. His statements targeted Jews, homosexuals, Black, non-white and mixed-race people. He referred to lynching, Nazi propaganda, and traitors to the white race. He also used his own website to recruit skinheads, and to link to other white supremacist websites.\n\nIf you are the victim of hate speech, there are different actions you can take and there are supports available to you:\n\nAsk for help: If you are in a public place and are being verbally or physically attacked, let others close by know you need help.\n\nDocument the incident: If it is safe, make a record of the incident by taking a photo or video of the perpetrator or the incident, or ask someone to do this for you. Note the time, day, location, witnesses, and any other information you can remember about the incident.\n\nIf you experience discriminatory or hate speech in your workplace, consider speaking to your supervisor, manager or human a resources representative and let them know how the behaviour is affecting you. If your workplace is unionized, consider talking to a shop steward. There may be policies and procedures in your organization to address these issues.\n\nFile a human rights complaint. To make a complaint under B.C.’s Human Rights Code, you must file a written complaint to the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal. Filing a written complaint starts a legal process that is similar to a court proceeding. Consider talking to a lawyer experienced in human rights law about your situation before filing a complaint.\n\nIf you are considering making a human rights complaint, you can find out more information about your rights through the BC Human Rights Tribunal and BC Human Rights Clinic websites, including the complaint process and time limits for filing complaints.\n\nIf you have a low income, there are other organizations that may be able to help you with filing a human rights complaint. The BC Human Rights Clinic provides free representation to residents of B.C. who have or are seeking to have, cases before the Human Rights Tribunal, to those people who meet the financial qualifications.\n\nReport it to the police: Contact the police if you feel safe and comfortable to do so. The Human Rights Commissioner recognizes that not everyone will feel safe or comfortable with the police based on past experiences including the impact of colonization.\n\nTo report an emergency, call 911. Emergency circumstances include:\n\nA crime in progress\n\nAn immediate threat to your safety\n\nAn immediate threat to the safety of someone else\n\nProperty in immediate danger of a criminal act\n\nTo report non-emergency hate speech or hate crimes—where there is no immediate threat to anyone’s safety or property—call the non-emergency number for your local police department, or visit your local police department to make a report in person. Find your local police department or RCMP detachment at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/criminal-justice/policing-in-bc/bc-police-forces\n\nFind support: Contact Victim Link for confidential, multilingual crisis support and information and referrals. Victim Link is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Resilience BC has Resources for Victims of Racism and Hate so you can see what supports work best for you.\n\nVictims, immediate family members and some witnesses may be eligible for services under the Crime Victim Assistance Program. This can include financial benefits to offset financial losses and assist in recovery for coping with the effects of violent crime. In most cases, the application must be received within one year from the date the crime took place. You do not have to wait for charges to be laid or for the offender to be convicted before applying for benefits.\n\nSpecialized support for Indigenous People: KUU-US Crisis Line Society (province-wide): Provides a First Nations and Indigenous specific crisis line available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, toll-free from anywhere in British Columbia.\n\nFirst Nations Health Authority Mental Health Benefit (province-wide): Health Benefits partners with Indigenous Services Canada to offer a comprehensive mental health plan to First Nations in BC. The plan covers counselling services from a qualified mental health provider, including psychologists, clinical counsellors and social workers.\n\nIf you witness a racist or hate incident, you can take action safely and effectively in several ways:\n\nAssess your safety first: Is it safe for you to say or do something? Your safety is key to being a good witness.\n\nFocus on the victim: If it is safe, engage the victim in conversation, ask if they are okay or if they would like some assistance. This will let the perpetrator know that the victim is not alone.\n\nEngage others: If it is safe, engage other witnesses. Talk to others in the space to gather support for the victim. There is power in numbers.\n\nDocument the incident: If it is safe, document the incident by taking a photo or video of the incident or making notes. Keep a safe distance and note the time, day and location. Always ask the victim what they want to do with the photo or video and don’t post it online without their permission.\n\nWhen it is safe: Ask the victim if they want to report the incident to the police (see below) and if they would like your help to do so, or if they want to connect with Victim Link. See also: Resilience BC’s Resources for Victims of Racism and Hate.\n\nIf you witness hate speech online\n\nIf you see hate speech on the internet, you can also:\n\nReport it to the website administrator: Most websites have rules known as ‘acceptable use policies’ that set out what cannot be put on their website and often say they do not allow comments, videos and photos that amount to hate speech. Web and social media sites may have simple ways for you to report about a page or video. Others may have a “report this page” button that you can click.\n\nFor example, companies like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube have policies related to hate speech. The Commissioner is not aware of how effective these policies are and does not endorse their use. We are providing this information for those who are seeking it:\n\nReport it to the hosting company: Hosting companies own the digital space that is rented by website owners to have a presence on the Internet. Hosting companies often have their own set of rules about content. You can find out which company hosts a website by entering their web address on the “Who is hosting this?” website.\n\nContact your own Internet service provider to get more information.\n\nAbout reporting hate speech to the police\n\nBC’s Office of the Human Rights Commissioner recognizes that some people from marginalized communities do not feel comfortable contacting the police due to the history of police violence and systemic discrimination against Indigenous, Black, and People of Colour, LGBTQ2SIA+ people, sex workers, homeless people, people with disabilities and other marginalized communities. Whenever possible, be sure to ask victims of a hate crime about their preferences to determine whether to contact police.\n\nTo report an emergency, call 911. Emergency circumstances include:\n\nA crime in progress\n\nAn immediate threat to your safety\n\nAn immediate threat to the safety of someone else\n\nProperty in immediate danger of a criminal act\n\nThe Human Rights Commissioner recognizes that not everyone will feel safe or comfortable with the police based on past experiences including the impact of colonization.\n\nTo report non-emergency hate speech or hate crimes, call the non-emergency number for your local police department, or visit your local police department to make a report in person. Find your local police department or RCMP detachment at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/criminal-justice/policing-in-bc/bc-police-forces\n\nNon-emergency circumstances involving hate speech could include:\n\nYou are the victim of hate speech or a hate crime, but there is no immediate threat to your safety.\n\nSomeone else is the victim of hate speech or a hate crime, but there is no immediate threat to anyone’s safety.\n\nInternet or social media posts that target a person or group—based on a protected characteristic—that threaten, promote hate or indicate a criminal act against a person or property.\n\nProperty was targeted by a hate crime."
