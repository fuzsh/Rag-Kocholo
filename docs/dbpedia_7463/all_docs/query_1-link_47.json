They create the overall design and direct others who develop artwork or layouts.\n\nDuties\n\nArt directors typically do the following:\n\nDetermine how best to represent a concept visually\n\nDetermine which photographs, art, or other design elements to use\n\nDevelop the overall look or style of a publication, an advertising campaign, or a theater, television, or film set\n\nManage graphic designers, set and exhibit designers, or other design staff\n\nReview and approve designs, artwork, photography, and graphics developed by other staff members\n\nTalk to clients to develop an artistic approach and style\n\nCoordinate activities with other artistic and creative departments\n\nDevelop detailed budgets and timelines\n\nPresent designs to clients for approval\n\nArt directors typically oversee the work of other designers and artists who produce images for television, film, live performances, advertisements, or video games. They determine the overall style in which a message is communicated visually to its audience. For each project, they articulate their vision to artists. The artists then create images, such as illustrations, graphics, photographs, or charts and graphs, or design stage and movie sets, according to the art director’s vision.\n\nArt directors work with art and design staffs in advertising agencies, public relations firms, or book, magazine, or newspaper publishing to create designs and layouts. They also work with producers and directors of theater, television, or movie productions to oversee set designs. Their work requires them to understand the design elements of projects, inspire other creative workers, and keep projects on budget and on time. Sometimes they are responsible for developing budgets and timelines.\n\nThe following are some specifics of what art directors do in different industries:\n\nIn advertising and public relations, art directors ensure that their clients’ desired message and image are conveyed to consumers. Art directors are responsible for the overall visual aspects of an advertising or media campaign and coordinate the work of other artistic or design staff, such as graphic designers.\n\nIn publishing, art directors typically oversee the page layout of catalogs, newspapers, or magazines. They also choose the cover art for books and periodicals. Often, this work includes publications for the Internet, so art directors oversee production of the websites used for publication.\n\nIn movie production, art directors collaborate with directors to determine what sets will be needed for the film and what style or look the sets should have. They hire and supervise a staff of assistant art directors or set designers to complete designs.\n\nHow to Become an Art Director About this section\n\nArt directors need at least a bachelor’s degree in an art or design subject and previous work experience. Depending on the industry, they may have worked as graphic designers, fine artists, editors, or photographers, or in another art or design occupation before becoming art directors.\n\nEducation\n\nArt directors typically need a bachelor's degree in fine arts, a design subject, or a related field, such as communications technology.\n\nMany art directors start out in another art-related occupation, such as fine artists or photographers. Work experience in art or design occupations develops an art director’s ability to visually communicate to a specific audience creatively and effectively. Workers gain the appropriate education for that occupation, usually by earning a bachelor of arts or bachelor of fine arts degree.\n\nSome art directors earn a master of fine arts (MFA) degree to supplement their work experience and show their creative or managerial ability.\n\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\n\nMost art directors have 5 or more years of work experience in another occupation before becoming art directors. Depending on the industry in which they previously worked, art directors may have had jobs as graphic designers, fine artists, editors, photographers, or in another art or design occupation.\n\nFor many artists, including art directors, developing a portfolio—a collection of an artist’s work that demonstrates his or her styles and abilities—is essential. Managers, clients, and others look at artists’ portfolios when they are deciding whether to hire an employee or contract for an art project.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Art directors must be able to listen to and speak with staff and clients to ensure that they understand employees’ ideas and clients’ desires for advertisements, publications, or movie sets.\n\nCreativity. Art directors must be able to come up with interesting and innovative ideas to develop advertising campaigns, set designs, or layout options.\n\nLeadership skills. Art directors must be able to organize, direct, and motivate other artists. They need to articulate their visions to artists and oversee the work as it progresses.\n\nResourcefulness. Art directors must be able to adapt their latest designs to the changing technology used in their industry.\n\nTime-management skills. Balancing competing priorities and multiple projects while meeting strict deadlines is critical for art directors.\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
