This document serves as a waybill that must be present in the vehicle during the transportation of alcoholic beverages to and from the catered event.\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this rule is to standardize procedures for closings of package stores, taverns and taprooms and any off-premises licensee while ensuring that residents of the neighborhoods in which the licensees operate are still able to make a lawful purchase of alcoholic beverages with reasonable convenience.\n\n2.0 Applicability\n\nThis rule shall apply to all package stores, taverns and taprooms as well as other off-premises licensees licensed by the Commissioner.\n\n3.0 Closings for Fourteen Days or Less\n\nLicensees shall not be required to notify the Commissioner in order to close their establishments for a cumulative period of fourteen days or less in any calendar year or in order to change their hours of operation during such a limited period of time; provided, however, that any licensee which closes for fourteen days or less or temporarily changes its hours of operation shall conspicuously post notice of that fact at all public entrances to the licensed premises.\n\n4.0 Closings for More Than Fourteen Days\n\n4.1 Procedures\n\n4.1.1 Whenever a licensed package store, tavern or taproom or other off-premises licensee intends to close for a period of more than fourteen days in any calendar year, or intends to close on specific days which when considered cumulatively amount to a period of more than fourteen days in any calendar year, the following procedure shall be followed:\n\n4.1.1.1 The licensee shall submit a letter of intent to the Commissioner which must include the specific dates during which the licensee intends to be closed and the reasons for which the licensee intends to close. The letter of intent must be filed at least twenty days but not more than sixty days before the first day on which the licensee intends to close.\n\n4.1.1.2 The letter of intent filed with the Commissioner shall be accompanied by certificates of the publishers of two newspapers circulated in the county in which the license operates. From the certificates it shall appear that the licensee has caused to be circulated in such newspapers at least three times within the period of twenty days immediately preceding the filing of the letter of intent with the Commissioner, a notice setting forth the intention of the licensee to close for a period of more than fourteen days in any calendar year, including the specific dates on which the licensee intends to be closed and advising the public of the right to object to the closure by filing a protest with the Commissioner. One of the notices shall appear in a newspaper circulated at the place in the county nearest to the location of the licensed premises.\n\n4.1.1.3 On the same date that the letter of intent is submitted to the Commissioner, the licensee shall send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of its intent to close for a period of more than fourteen days in the calendar year, including the specific dates on which the licensee intends to be closed, to all licensed package stores, taverns and taprooms located within one mile of the licensed premises.\n\n4.1.1.4 On the same date that the letter of intent is submitted to the Commissioner, the licensee shall conspicuously post a Public Notice sign at all public entrances to the licensed premises stating the intent to close and specifying the dates during which the licensed premises will be closed.

In addition, many non-profit, charitable organizations are granted gathering licenses pursuant to 4 Del.C. ยง514(b) and Commissioner Rule 602 to sell alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses of private country clubs, outside of the licensed club house. The issuance of both types of licenses is consistent with the intent of the Liquor Control Act, which is to make alcoholic liquors available to members and guests, who are of legal drinking age, under strictly controlled conditions.\n\n1.2 It is the finding of the Commissioner that the private country clubs licensed to sell alcoholic liquors in Delaware have established and enforced reasonable rules and guidelines governing the conduct of their members and guests. Responsible and lawful behavior is required of all members and guests. On various occasions, the Commissioner has approved the extension of country club liquor licenses to include areas of the grounds and golf course outside of the normally licensed club house. These events have been held for many years without incident. Several country clubs have now requested approval to expand their liquor license to allow for the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses that they operate. Requests have been made to allow the selling of alcoholic liquors from concessionaire stands and mobile golf carts, and to permit the consumption of alcoholic liquors on the entire premises controlled by the country club.\n\n2.0 Purpose\n\n2.1 This rule is promulgated pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to regulate the time, place, and manner in which alcoholic liquors are sold and dispensed (4 Del.C. ยง304). In addition, it is the purpose of this rule to implement and clarify the Commissioner's authority to license a multiple activity club, in this case a private country club, to sell alcoholic liquors for consumption on any portion of the premises approved by the Commissioner [4 Del.C. ยง512(a)]. In accordance with these statutes alcoholic liquors may be sold or dispensed in a manner consistent with Title 4 of the Delaware Code and Commissioner Rules.\n\n2.2 By the promulgation of this rule, the Commissioner finds that alcoholic liquors may be sold and consumed on the grounds and golf courses of private country clubs that have been approved by the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this rule.\n\n3.0 Definition; as used in this Rule\n\nโCountry clubโ means a privately owned and operated facility that provides social activities and recreation to its members, and operates a golf course. It must also be licensed by the Commissioner as a multiple activity club.\n\n4.0 Applicability\n\nThis rule shall govern the manner in which private country clubs sell and dispense alcoholic liquors outside of the licensed clubhouse. In addition, all other applicable laws and rules shall apply to all extension of a multiple activity club license.\n\n5.0 Procedure\n\n5.1 The Commissioner may approve the sale and dispensing of alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses of privately owned and operated country clubs provided, however, that they comply with the requirements that follow:\n\n5.1.1 Submit to the Commissioner a diagram or plot plan that is drawn to scale and that clearly indicates the area(s) in or on which the sale, dispensing, and consumption of alcoholic liquors is requested;\n\n5.1.2 Submit to the Commissioner a copy of the club's rules that govern the conduct of its' members and guests;\n\n5.1.3 Submit to the Commissioner a written plan detailing the procedures it will follow to insure responsible and moderate consumption of alcoholic liquors on its premises;\n\n5.1.4 Submit to the Commissioner proof that its' employees who serve, handle or manage the service of alcoholic liquors have successfully completed a Commissioner approved responsible beverage server training program.\n\n5.2 The Commissioner may deny an application to extend a multiple activity club license if the applicant fails to provide for the responsible sale, handling, and consumption of alcoholic liquors or the extension of such a license is otherwise found to be adverse to the best interest of the public, adjoining property owners or the clubs members and guests. In addition, the Commissioner may revoke the extension of a country club's multiple activity club license for just cause.\n\n5.3 The Commissioner may grant an extension of a country club's multiple activity license to permit consumption of alcoholic liquors on golf courses and grounds, provided that it is lawfully purchased on the premises. In addition, the Commissioner may approve the sale of alcoholic liquors from golf carts and concessionaire stands on the golf course provided that all alcoholic liquors are securely stored when not being offered for sale.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThis rule is promulgated pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to regulate the time, place, and manner in which alcoholic liquors are sold and dispensed (4 Del.C. ยง304). In addition, it is the purpose of this rule to implement and clarify the Commissioner's authority to license a movie theater to sell alcoholic liquors for consumption on any portion of the premises approved by the Commissioner (4 Del.C. ยง512 (f)). In accordance with these statutes alcoholic liquors may be sold or dispensed in a manner consistent with Title 4 of the Delaware Code and Commissioner Rules.\n\nBy the promulgation of this rule, the Commissioner finds that alcoholic liquors may be sold and consumed on the premises of a movie theater that has been approved by the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this rule.\n\n2.0 Definitions\n\nFor purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply.\n\n\"Alcoholic beverage\" means a beverage consisting of no more than sixteen (16) ounces of beer, eight (8) ounces of wine, or two (2) ounces of spirits.\n\n\"Movie theater\" means an indoor facility used to host showings of motion pictures which:\n\na. has a capacity of at least 500 patrons for any single movie showing or for showing of multiple movies in separate theaters at the same time;\n\nb. shall host a minimum of 250 movie showings in any calendar year and shall be open at least 5 days a week;\n\nc. has video cameras in each theater auditorium that allows supervision of movie patrons from a centralized or remote location during a movie showing; and\n\nd. has a separate bar or location where alcohol is sold, served or dispensed that is separated from where food and non-alcoholic drink are sold.\n\n3.0 Approved Course Required\n\nAll movie theater managers and employees involved in serving alcohol must successfully complete within 30 days from employment an approved course on the responsible service of alcoholic beverages.\n\n4.0 Minors Prohibited\n\nNo minors are permitted to stand or sit at the bar or counter where alcoholic beverages are sold, served or consumed.\n\n5.0 Dispensing Limitations\n\nNo more than one (1) alcoholic beverage may be sold to a patron at a time who is at least twenty-one (21) years old and no more than two (2) alcoholic beverages may be sold per patron per movie showing. The alcoholic beverage must be dispensed in a container that is clearly different from other non-alcoholic drinks and the patron purchasing the alcoholic beverage must be identified by a wrist band or similar means.\n\n6.0 Inspection Required\n\nA server trained individual must physically inspect each theater at least once during each movie showing to ensure that persons under the age of twenty-one (21) are not consuming alcohol.\n\n18 DE Reg. 398 (11/01/14)\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Defining Multiple Activity Clubs\n\n1.1 A licensed club whose gross revenue from the sale of alcoholic liquor does not exceed 40% of its total annual revenue from all sources and which either:\n\n1.1.1 Serves meals at regular hours six days a week, or\n\n1.1.2 Has a physical facility, regularly used by members of the club other than club rooms for the sale and service of food and alcoholic liquor and which facility is of a permanent nature and regularly used, i.e., tennis court, golf course, indoor pool, may apply for a Multiple Activity Club License.\n\n1.2 A Multiple Activity Club License permits the sale of alcoholic liquor to guests of the club or guests of its members.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Clubs\n\n1.1 \"The word \"'club\"' means a corporation or association created by competent authority, which is the owner, lessee or occupant of premises operated solely for objects of national, social, patriotic, political or athletic nature, or the like, whether or not for pecuniary gain, and the property as well as the advantages of which belong to or are enjoyed by the stockholders or by the members of such corporation or association.\"\n\n1.2 At the time of the making of an application for a license under the Liquor Control Act, and at all times after the granting of a license, upon demand of the Commissioner, such 'club' shall produce at the office of the Commissioner, the original or a properly authenticated copy of its charter or articles of association, its minute books, membership and financial records, covering the full-period of its licensed existence.\n\n1.3 Said charter, articles of association, minutes mad financial records will show that all profit from the sale of alcoholic beverages is controlled by the membership, and its properly elected officers, and used for the authorized objects of the club.\n\n1.4 At the time of the making of an application for a license to sell alcoholic liquors and at any time after the granting of a license, upon demand of the Commissioner, such club shall furnish the Commissioner forthwith with a statement, signed by its President or Vice-President and notarized, setting forth the reason for organization of the club and the activities in detail carried on by the club.\n\n1.5 No club licensed under the Delaware Liquor Control Act shall have or maintain any \"peephole\", \"bell\", \"buzzer\", or other warning device at any entrance to the club premises; and immediate access to all parts of the premises of the club shall at all times be accorded to DATE or the authorized representatives of the Commissioner, including all qualified police officers in the State of Delaware, when accompanied by DATE or an Inspector of the Commissioner, all of whom shall be permitted to enter immediately and given immediate access to all parts of the premises of a club without a search warrant.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Purpose and Scope\n\nThis Rule implements the 1982 and 1989 Amendments to the Liquor Control Act extending the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to so called \"bottle clubs.\" 4 Del.C. ยง515, 515Aa, 902(7) and 554(aa), 60 Del.

In addition, a \"restaurant\" shall have a valid and current restaurant retailer license required by 30 Del.C. ยง2906.\n\n25 DE Reg. 960 (04/01/22)\n\n3.0 General Policy\n\nNo establishment shall be operated for profit or pecuniary gain as a \"bottle club\" unless licensed by the Commissioner. Licensed \"bottle clubs\" shall, within the limits of their license, be held to the same standards of performance and financial responsibility as other types of license holders.\n\n4.0 Standards of Operation for \"Bottle Club\"\n\n4.1 Hours of Operation\n\n4.1.1 An establishment operated as a \"bottle club\" shall not permit the consumption of alcoholic beverages on its premises after 2:00 a.m. or before 9:00 a.m. on any day. The presence of alcoholic liquors on the premises of a \"bottle club\" between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. shall be prima facie evidence of a violation.\n\n4.2 Service of General Public.\n\n4.2.1 A \"bottle club\" may require membership upon payment of a reasonable fee, but approval of such membership shall not be unreasonably denied. A club shall not charge an admission charge or fee, but may charge a cover or minimum during hours when live entertainment is actually being presented.\n\n4.3 Service of Food\n\n4.3.1 A reasonable selection of food shall be available from a written menu or menu board at all hours when alcoholic beverages are being consumed.

A member of a club is defined by Section 101, Chapter 1, Title 4, Delaware Code of 1953, as follows:\n\n\"Member of a club\" means an individual who, whether as a charter member or admitted in accordance with the rules or the by-laws of the club, has become a member thereof, who maintains their membership by the payment of dues in the manner established by the rules or by-laws, and whose name and address is entered on the list of members supplied to the Commissioner at the time of the application for a license under Chapter 5 of this Title, or, if admitted thereafter, within eight days after his admission and payment of dues, if such dues are required. The Commissioner is authorized to extend the meaning of the words \"member of a club\" to include those who are granted temporary membership or membership of less than one year in accordance with a rule or by-law of the club approved by the Commissioner.\n\n1.2 A guest may consume alcoholic liquor at a club provided that at all times the guest is on the licensed premises the host member of the club who introduced the guest also remains on the licensed premises and pays for the alcoholic liquor.\n\n1.3 If the club in the form of a lodge desires members of subordinate lodges under the same grand lodge to have the privilege of buying alcoholic liquor at their club, this may be done by the lodge passing a resolution granting the privileges of the club to members of other subordinate lodges, providing such member presents their card indicating their membership in such subordinate lodge. A record shall be kept of the names of such members of subordinate lodges to whom such privileges are extended.\n\n2.0 Multiple Activity Club\n\nA license for the sale of alcoholic liquor by a multiple activity club to persons who are guests of that club or of a member of that club is in addition to its license as a club which authorizes the sale of alcoholic liquor only to members of the club.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Calculation of Measurements\n\n1.1 In computing the distance, pursuant to 4 Del.C. ยง543, between a proposed establishment and a licensed establishment of the same type by accessible public road or street, the measurements shall be taken as follows:\n\n1.1.1 The measurements shall begin and end at that part of the individual establishment which is available to the public and closest to the other establishment.

In multiple purpose buildings, in which a liquor establishment is not the primary use, the measurement shall be made from the portion of the building used for the licensed establishment, and the measured distance shall include corridors, etc., when necessary to reach the nearest accessible public road or street.\n\n1.1.2 Straight lines shall then be drawn from these terminal points, and at right angles thereto, to the center of the adjoining means of ingress and egress.\n\n1.1.3 The lines shall then continue to follow the center lines of regular or established traffic patterns (pedestrian or vehicular) until a public road or street is reached at its center line. The lines shall be drawn to the center of the nearest regular or established traffic pattern for vehicular traffic.\n\n1.1.4 The lines shall continue on the center lines of public roads or streets until they meet.\n\n1.1.5 Except where impracticable lines shall be drawn at right angles to each other and shall be straight.\n\n1.1.6 In all cases, the shortest distance from a proposed establishment to a licensed establishment shall be used as the distance between the two, and said shortest distance shall be measured only by accessible public road or street and the Commissioner may consider motor vehicle traffic directions, patterns and barriers and pedestrian traffic patterns."
