The letter of intent must be filed at least twenty days but not more than sixty days before the first day on which the licensee intends to close.\n\n4.1.1.2 The letter of intent filed with the Commissioner shall be accompanied by certificates of the publishers of two newspapers circulated in the county in which the license operates. From the certificates it shall appear that the licensee has caused to be circulated in such newspapers at least three times within the period of twenty days immediately preceding the filing of the letter of intent with the Commissioner, a notice setting forth the intention of the licensee to close for a period of more than fourteen days in any calendar year, including the specific dates on which the licensee intends to be closed and advising the public of the right to object to the closure by filing a protest with the Commissioner. One of the notices shall appear in a newspaper circulated at the place in the county nearest to the location of the licensed premises.\n\n4.1.1.3 On the same date that the letter of intent is submitted to the Commissioner, the licensee shall send notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, of its intent to close for a period of more than fourteen days in the calendar year, including the specific dates on which the licensee intends to be closed, to all licensed package stores, taverns and taprooms located within one mile of the licensed premises.\n\n4.1.1.4 On the same date that the letter of intent is submitted to the Commissioner, the licensee shall conspicuously post a Public Notice sign at all public entrances to the licensed premises stating the intent to close and specifying the dates during which the licensed premises will be closed.

In addition, many non-profit, charitable organizations are granted gathering licenses pursuant to 4 Del.C. §514(b) and Commissioner Rule 602 to sell alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses of private country clubs, outside of the licensed club house. The issuance of both types of licenses is consistent with the intent of the Liquor Control Act, which is to make alcoholic liquors available to members and guests, who are of legal drinking age, under strictly controlled conditions.\n\n1.2 It is the finding of the Commissioner that the private country clubs licensed to sell alcoholic liquors in Delaware have established and enforced reasonable rules and guidelines governing the conduct of their members and guests. Responsible and lawful behavior is required of all members and guests. On various occasions, the Commissioner has approved the extension of country club liquor licenses to include areas of the grounds and golf course outside of the normally licensed club house. These events have been held for many years without incident. Several country clubs have now requested approval to expand their liquor license to allow for the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses that they operate. Requests have been made to allow the selling of alcoholic liquors from concessionaire stands and mobile golf carts, and to permit the consumption of alcoholic liquors on the entire premises controlled by the country club.\n\n2.0 Purpose\n\n2.1 This rule is promulgated pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to regulate the time, place, and manner in which alcoholic liquors are sold and dispensed (4 Del.C. §304). In addition, it is the purpose of this rule to implement and clarify the Commissioner's authority to license a multiple activity club, in this case a private country club, to sell alcoholic liquors for consumption on any portion of the premises approved by the Commissioner [4 Del.C. §512(a)]. In accordance with these statutes alcoholic liquors may be sold or dispensed in a manner consistent with Title 4 of the Delaware Code and Commissioner Rules.\n\n2.2 By the promulgation of this rule, the Commissioner finds that alcoholic liquors may be sold and consumed on the grounds and golf courses of private country clubs that have been approved by the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this rule.\n\n3.0 Definition; as used in this Rule\n\n“Country club” means a privately owned and operated facility that provides social activities and recreation to its members, and operates a golf course. It must also be licensed by the Commissioner as a multiple activity club.\n\n4.0 Applicability\n\nThis rule shall govern the manner in which private country clubs sell and dispense alcoholic liquors outside of the licensed clubhouse. In addition, all other applicable laws and rules shall apply to all extension of a multiple activity club license.\n\n5.0 Procedure\n\n5.1 The Commissioner may approve the sale and dispensing of alcoholic liquors on the grounds and golf courses of privately owned and operated country clubs provided, however, that they comply with the requirements that follow:\n\n5.1.1 Submit to the Commissioner a diagram or plot plan that is drawn to scale and that clearly indicates the area(s) in or on which the sale, dispensing, and consumption of alcoholic liquors is requested;\n\n5.1.2 Submit to the Commissioner a copy of the club's rules that govern the conduct of its' members and guests;\n\n5.1.3 Submit to the Commissioner a written plan detailing the procedures it will follow to insure responsible and moderate consumption of alcoholic liquors on its premises;\n\n5.1.4 Submit to the Commissioner proof that its' employees who serve, handle or manage the service of alcoholic liquors have successfully completed a Commissioner approved responsible beverage server training program.\n\n5.2 The Commissioner may deny an application to extend a multiple activity club license if the applicant fails to provide for the responsible sale, handling, and consumption of alcoholic liquors or the extension of such a license is otherwise found to be adverse to the best interest of the public, adjoining property owners or the clubs members and guests. In addition, the Commissioner may revoke the extension of a country club's multiple activity club license for just cause.\n\n5.3 The Commissioner may grant an extension of a country club's multiple activity license to permit consumption of alcoholic liquors on golf courses and grounds, provided that it is lawfully purchased on the premises. In addition, the Commissioner may approve the sale of alcoholic liquors from golf carts and concessionaire stands on the golf course provided that all alcoholic liquors are securely stored when not being offered for sale.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Purpose\n\nThis rule is promulgated pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to regulate the time, place, and manner in which alcoholic liquors are sold and dispensed (4 Del.C. §304). In addition, it is the purpose of this rule to implement and clarify the Commissioner's authority to license a movie theater to sell alcoholic liquors for consumption on any portion of the premises approved by the Commissioner (4 Del.C. §512 (f)). In accordance with these statutes alcoholic liquors may be sold or dispensed in a manner consistent with Title 4 of the Delaware Code and Commissioner Rules.\n\nBy the promulgation of this rule, the Commissioner finds that alcoholic liquors may be sold and consumed on the premises of a movie theater that has been approved by the Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of this rule.\n\n2.0 Definitions\n\nFor purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply.\n\n\"Alcoholic beverage\" means a beverage consisting of no more than sixteen (16) ounces of beer, eight (8) ounces of wine, or two (2) ounces of spirits.\n\n\"Movie theater\" means an indoor facility used to host showings of motion pictures which:\n\na. has a capacity of at least 500 patrons for any single movie showing or for showing of multiple movies in separate theaters at the same time;\n\nb. shall host a minimum of 250 movie showings in any calendar year and shall be open at least 5 days a week;\n\nc. has video cameras in each theater auditorium that allows supervision of movie patrons from a centralized or remote location during a movie showing; and\n\nd. has a separate bar or location where alcohol is sold, served or dispensed that is separated from where food and non-alcoholic drink are sold.\n\n3.0 Approved Course Required\n\nAll movie theater managers and employees involved in serving alcohol must successfully complete within 30 days from employment an approved course on the responsible service of alcoholic beverages.\n\n4.0 Minors Prohibited\n\nNo minors are permitted to stand or sit at the bar or counter where alcoholic beverages are sold, served or consumed.\n\n5.0 Dispensing Limitations\n\nNo more than one (1) alcoholic beverage may be sold to a patron at a time who is at least twenty-one (21) years old and no more than two (2) alcoholic beverages may be sold per patron per movie showing.

A record shall be kept of the names of such members of subordinate lodges to whom such privileges are extended.\n\n2.0 Multiple Activity Club\n\nA license for the sale of alcoholic liquor by a multiple activity club to persons who are guests of that club or of a member of that club is in addition to its license as a club which authorizes the sale of alcoholic liquor only to members of the club.\n\n19 DE Reg. 775 (02/01/16)\n\n1.0 Calculation of Measurements\n\n1.1 In computing the distance, pursuant to 4 Del.C. §543, between a proposed establishment and a licensed establishment of the same type by accessible public road or street, the measurements shall be taken as follows:\n\n1.1.1 The measurements shall begin and end at that part of the individual establishment which is available to the public and closest to the other establishment.

The lines shall be drawn to the center of the nearest regular or established traffic pattern for vehicular traffic.\n\n1.1.4 The lines shall continue on the center lines of public roads or streets until they meet.\n\n1.1.5 Except where impracticable lines shall be drawn at right angles to each other and shall be straight.\n\n1.1.6 In all cases, the shortest distance from a proposed establishment to a licensed establishment shall be used as the distance between the two, and said shortest distance shall be measured only by accessible public road or street and the Commissioner may consider motor vehicle traffic directions, patterns and barriers and pedestrian traffic patterns."
