        "text": "STATE CONSTITUTION (EXCERPT)\n\nCONSTITUTION OF MICHIGAN OF 1963\n\n§ 6 Independent citizens redistricting commission for state legislative and congressional districts.\n\nSec. 6.\n\nHistory: Const. 1963, Art. IV, § 6, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964 ;-- Am. Init., approved Nov. 6, 2018, Eff. Dec. 22, 2018\n\nCompiler's Notes: The constitutional amendment set out above was submitted to, and approved by, the electors as Proposal 18-2 at the November 6, 2018 general election. This amendment to the Constitution of Michigan of 1963 became effective December 22, 2018.\n\nConstitutionality: The United States Supreme Court held in Reynolds v Sims, 377 US 533; 84 S Ct 1362; 12 L Ed 2d 506 (1964) that provisions establishing weighted land area-population formulae violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Because the apportionment provisions of former art IV, §§ 2 - 6 are interdependent and not severable, the provisions are invalidated in their entirety and the Commission on Legislative Apportionment cannot survive. In re Apportionment of State Legislature—1982, 413 Mich 96; 321 NW2d 565 (1982), rehearing denied 413 Mich 149; 321 NW2d 585; stay denied 413 Mich 222; 321 NW2d 615, appeal dismissed 459 US 900; 103 S Ct 201; 74 L Ed 2d 161."
