And why is it important?\n\nA-roll is the main footage used to tell the story. As its name implies, B-roll is footage that plays a more secondary role. B-roll consists of supplemental footage that supports the main footage, such as by providing visual context or background to the central story and characters. These terms have their origins in filmmaking, but they also apply to music videos and documentaries.\n\nIn music, film, and television, A-roll takes the spotlight as the primary footage. It is the core component that showcases a scene's main subject or action. In music videos, the A-roll often features the artist or band performing the song, conveying their emotions, and connecting with the audience.\n\nLikewise, in film and television, A-roll consists of scenes that drive the narrative forward. It includes dialogue, key interactions between characters, and critical story elements. These shots are carefully crafted to captivate the audience and convey the intended message, especially with the use of production music for film and television.\n\nThese additional visuals serve as transitions, cover cuts, or help create a visually appealing montage. B-roll shots can also be used to intensify the emotional impact of a scene or offer an alternative perspective, particularly when combined with effective background music for TV and film.\n\nCreatively using B-roll material helps improve your content by enhancing ambiance, mood, visual pacing, and variety. There are no fixed rules, so we encourage you to have fun and experiment with B-roll footage on your next project. Our music library interface is fully compatible with video editing tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro, letting you hone your creativity and execute wonderfully crafted projects.\n\nA-roll brings the main content to life, be it a musician's performance or a filmmaker's narrative, while the B-roll adds depth, visual interest, and context. Understanding the difference between these two types of footage is essential for crafting engaging audiovisual experiences that resonate with audiences.\n\nRegister for access to high-quality music with a Universal Production Music license.
