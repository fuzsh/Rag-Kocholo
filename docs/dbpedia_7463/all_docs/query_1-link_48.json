        "text": "Alabama requires “written consent” to employ Child Actors, Performers, and Models, and if it is a film production, the consent must be signed by the Alabama Film Office. The work may not be detrimental to the minor’s life, health, safety, welfare, or morals and cannot interfere with the minor’s schooling. Minors under age 16 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at all rehearsals, appearances, performances, or sessions, and for minors under age 16 working as actors or performers, provisions must be made for full-time equivalent education.\n\nExtensive requirements for theatrical employment: The Labor Commissioner issues permits to minors to work in the entertainment industry with required documentation from appropriate school districts as applicable and/or permits permitting employment of minors in the entertainment industry.\n\nSec. 6-1308.7-Work permit to work not more than 5 consecutive days in the entertainment or allied industries; excused from school for up to 5 absences per school year; school districts are to allow pupils to complete all assignments and tests missed during absence.\n\nSec. 6750 Family Code - Courts may require a portion of earnings be set aside for the minor in a trust.\n\nIC 22-2-18.1-14 & 16 – For minors less than age 18, employment in listed activities must not be detrimental to the life, health, safety, or welfare of the minor or interfere with their schooling; employment or appearances cannot be in a cabaret, dance hall, night club, etc.; and if the minor works as an actor or performer and certain provisions are met, they are exempt from the hours per day/week, days per week, and time of day restrictions. For minors less than age 16, provisions must be made for full-time equivalent education, and they must be accompanied by a parent at all rehearsals, appearances, and performances.\n\nChap. 149, Sec. 60 - Minors under the age of 16 may take part on the stage in a theater where not more than 2 performances are given in one day and not more than 8 performances are given in any one week with written permission from the attorney general. The Attorney General's Office has the authority to issue temporary waivers of time restrictions for children working in entertainment, theater or film (M.G.L. c. 149, § 60 & M.G.L. c. 149, § 104.)\n\nA work permit is required at all times when employing children under the age of sixteen issued only by the school superintendents, school principals, other appropriate school officers or the director of the labor and industrial division. The work must also be certified as not dangerous to the child or prohibited as outlined in the FLSA hazardous list. The maximum number of hours allowed for children under the age of sixteen to work is 18 hours a week during the school week and 40 hours a week in non-school weeks.\n\nWith respect to employing and protecting child performers in the entertainment industry, including motion pictures, theatrical, radio, and television productions, employers are required to follow educational and safety requirements and they are responsible for obtaining a Pre-Authorization Certificate for any child performing under the age of 18 before the employment begins. The certificate is valid for one year or until the specific project is completed, whichever time period is shorter. The employer must provide a certified teacher for each group of 10 or fewer children and must provide a New Mexico certified trainer or technician at the place of employment at all times when a child performer may be exposed to potentially hazardous conditions.\n\nThe statutes governing child entertainment within New Mexico can be found at the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions – Child Labor Section - 11.1.4.10 – 11.1.4.14.\n\nGeneral Puerto Rico labor laws apply to all employment of minors, including work in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe child labor statute includes an exception for concerts or theatrical performances, in which a minor is allowed to work up to midnight (outside of the usual limits of 6PM or 10PM, depending on the minor's age). The Secretary of Labor and Human Resources must approve prior to the event. Minors under the age of 14 working in artistic activities are subject to additional rules, including restrictions on the subject matter and types of venues in which they can perform."
