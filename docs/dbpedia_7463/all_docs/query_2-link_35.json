In real life, actor Sylvester Stallone, the former Philadelphian who acted as the fictional Rocky in a series of films, presented the statue to the City of Philadelphia in 1982. In the movies, the fictional boxer ended his morning run through the streets of Philadelphia with an ascent up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nBut unlike the people in the film script, the real citizens of Philadelphia argued over the work. As an image of popular culture it was unparalleled; local moviegoers wanted to memorialize Rocky’s inspirational climb up the Art Museum steps. Others felt the statue lacked dignity and was essentially a movie prop that did not belong permanently at that location. After prolonged dispute, the city formally accepted the gift, and it was moved to the Spectrum, a sports complex in South Philadelphia.\n\nFor Stallone, Rocky’s ascent to the top of the steps is symbolic of Philadelphia, a city where an underdog can become a champion through hard work, determination, and hustle.\n\nRocky the statue is the work of A. Thomas Schomberg, whose sculptures of athletes have been installed at the Astrodome, Superdome, and Yankee Stadium. The controversy was rekindled in 1990, when the film producers relocated the sculpture for the filming of Rocky V, but, in the end, Rocky was returned to the Spectrum. Rocky was ultimately relocated to an area next to the Museum’s steps in 2006.\n\nAdapted from Public Art in Philadelphia by Penny Balkin Bach (Temple University Press, Philadelphia, 1992).\n\nhttps://www.associationforpublicart.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MWW_18_Rocky_2020-1.mp3\n\nVoices heard in the Museum Without Walls: AUDIO program: James “Jimmy” Binns is a Philadelphia Lawyer and former Pennsylvania Boxing Commissioner. A. Thomas Schomberg was commissioned to create a statue of Rocky Balboa for the movie “Rocky III.” | Segment Producer: Ann Heppermann\n\nMuseum Without Walls: AUDIO is the Association for Public Art’s award-winning audio program for Philadelphia’s outdoor sculpture.
