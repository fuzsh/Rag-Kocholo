        "text": "Many organizations market themselves as being able to submit your headshot and information to popular series, shows or features. Productions that we recruit to the state generally use LOCAL or regional Casting Directors, Talent Agencies, and/or Extras Casting Directors to find LOCAL talent.\n\nPlease don't sign up for services that charge to submit for headshots or casting calls.\n\nOur office is aware of a production targeting local crew members, promising employment and even an upfront pre-production payment via check.\n\nPlease DO NOT fall for these type of scams by accepting what will turn out to be a bogus check. The so-called producer will be very insitent that you cash the check immediately. The producer will then claim some excuse for overpayment and ask for some of the money to be returned. By the time the bank processes the check and it bounces, YOU will be the one responsible for paying back ALL the funds.\n\nMost of these scams are vague in details, using phrases like:\n\n\"The film will be shot in different locations within your area.\"\n\n\"All I need you to do is to complete all tasks promptly.\"\n\n\"I have hired people in the past who did not live up to expectations and this time, I do not want to make the same mistake.\"\n\n\"The financial officer will issue a paycheck that will be delivered to your mailing address.\"\n\nIf you have any questions about the legitimacy of any productions that claim to be in SC, please contact us."
