        "text": "HAYS COUNTY, Texas – After beginning construction in February 2024, the detour at US 290 and Trautwein Road will be removed and Trautwein Road will be open to traffic starting today, August 5, 2024. Motorists can expect traffic patterns to return to normal, with the right turn lane from westbound US 290 to Trautwein Road open as well.\n\nHays County, in partnership with the Texas Department of Transportation, planned improvements to Trautwein Road at the intersection of US 290 to increase visibility and safety for travelers. During construction, Trautwein Road was closed to through traffic and a detour was set in place.\n\nImprovements included in this project are:\n\nLowering Trautwein Road at US 290 to improve visibility\n\nAdding a dedicated right turn lane from westbound US 290 to Trautwein Road\n\nAdding retaining walls to Trautwein Road\n\nImproving intersection signal on US 290\n\nHays County Commissioner Walt Smith, who championed this transformative project, proudly shared, “This project has been a passion of mine since taking office in 2019. The intersection has had numerous safety concerns and major accidents for years. I’m proud that by proactively partnering with TxDOT, we delivered this project on budget and on time while improving safety for all our residents.”"
