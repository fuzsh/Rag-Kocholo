        "text": "A Vietnam veteran (Michael Moriarty) has righteous indignation and indecisive judgment at odds within his own mind, in a mental spiral perhaps unmatched in any other film that captures the 70's post-war life. The veteran turns to police work, and soon gets thrown into the fire. While he sympathizes more with the criminals and homeless than his street-wise mentor (Yaphet Kotto), he soon realizes the same tactics that pervaded and controlled his life in Vietnam are far from being a thing of the past. Moriarty's torment and wishy-washy attitude amid the drug-addled zeitgeist is mesmerizing, a tour-de-force of sleaze, wanton hope, and unintentional recklessness. There are two top shelf chases that keep class with their more popular brethren of the…\n\nI feel like I have seen every great American film from the 1970s, then another comes along, that I hadn't heard about before, from a director without any real reputation, and I get that cinematic high that I live for. If this could happen every few months that make me a very happy man. Eventually I will run out of every great crime film, drama film, comedy film from the 1970s, but 2020 was not the year, and Report to the Commissioner was the first of hopefully many.\n\nReport to the Commissioner is a really bleak and gritty crime film. Made in 1975, directed by Milton Katselas, the film has almost docu-drama aspect to it, with some impassive voiceover and…\n\nNoirvember #27\n\nOne hell of a powderkeg clusterfuck, this was. Wasn’t sure how to feel about Report To The Commissioner during its first half. The film echoes its literary source through a collage structure of voice-overs and flashbacks. The opening presents a disastrous outcome: a woman shot dead, turns out she was an undercover, the frazzled sweat-drenched detective who accidentally killed her, the demand for “a report, not a cover-up”. Alternating narrations and perspectives piece together that very report, the events fueled by a wealth of the era’s powerhouse character actors. Yaphat Kotto as jagged jaded detective Blackstone, Susan Blakely as the ambitious undercover Patty Butler, Tony King as the drug pusher she’s trying to bust, appearances from Gere, Devane,…\n\nSummer of Scam 2: Criminally Insane\n\nFor some reason I always assumed this was a poliziotteschi, but no. This is a very American, very New York 1970s crime drama.\n\nIt's also a pretty difficult one to pin down and I would really like to revisit it because I feel like I either missed a plot point somewhere or it's just not very well written or directed in places. There's a jump somewhere in exactly what the cops are monitoring drug pusher Tony King for that didn't seem clear to me.\n\nThe racial politics in this are also very.... interesting, let's just say, and unlikely to sit well with many people who watch this. I also remain unconvinced as to whether…\n\nThere’s messy investigations and then there’s REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER. Almost every character is wrong in some way, the question is who will be held accountable for their part in “the report”?\n\n“Chicklet” is a White female cop working undercover. She’s dead, but when she was alive she was shacked up with “Stick”, a Black heroin dealer. Some cops were aware of her placement, and some weren’t. Bo (Michael Moriarty) didn’t know; he’s another undercover cop, asked to track down Chicklet, even though her superiors already know where she is. The whole thing stinks from the onset.\n\nAs the film unfolds through voice-over and flashback, we see Bo starting out. It’s easy to see why he’s picked for undercover; like…"
