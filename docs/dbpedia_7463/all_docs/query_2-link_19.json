The New Jersey Motion Picture & Television Commission, now part of the Authority, has supported and nurtured the film, television, and media industry for over 45 years. The Commission attracts and supports production work and promotes infrastructure growth through financial incentives, permitting, production services, site selection and clearance. The Commission is a critical partner in advancing the goals of this RFI.\n\nQualified entities do not need to be located within the State of New Jersey to provide a response and the Authority welcomes perspectives from entities outside of the state.\n\nThrough this RFI, the Authority is seeking information from respondents on the scope and characteristics of effective workforce training programs in anticipation of creating or supporting programs and initiatives to support workforce development for film, television, digital and other media production occupations, including but limited to, production assistants, production accountants, studio managers, carpenters, grips, electricians, set-dressers, wardrobe assistants, make-up, hair, script supervisors, voiceover artists, editors, computer generated imagery artists, edit assistants, screenwriters, story editors, assistant directors, writer’s assistants, music supervisors, and post supervisors. Given the projected growth of the film, television, and media industry over the coming years and its capacity to provide high-value employment to communities throughout the state, the NJEDA has earmarked at least $5 million in funding through an appropriation in the state budget from Governor Murphy and the NJ State Legislature to support and accelerate robust workforce development in the film, television, and media industry in New Jersey. The NJEDA is interested in receiving comments, questions, recommendations, facts, information, ideas, and responses that will help the Authority better understand best practices for industry workforce program designs, parameters, and details that NJEDA should consider when developing a portfolio of film and media production training programs that enable NJ residents to be part of this growing industry.\n\nThis RFI seeks to:\n\nCollect information on training programs that include instructors and mentors who are currently employed in the production of film and television (production and post-production) who will create teaching plans (syllabi) that are not theoretical in nature but, instead, will impart, “real world/on-set” best technique and practices.\n\nBetter understand the state of the film and media workforce in New Jersey and any existing workforce gaps\n\nGain greater insights into the film industry recruitment and training process\n\nCollect information on specific best practices, programs and approaches to support film workforce training and development needs including short-term bootcamps and longer-term training programs, and the specific populations those programs seek to serve, including residents of Overburdened Communities\n\nLearn about existing models in the United States and throughout the world that should be explored when developing film and media workforce development programs, particularly those that prepare workers with limited to no experience in the industry\n\n2. BACKGROUND\n\nThe New Jersey Economic Development Authority serves as the State’s principal agency for driving economic growth. The Authority is committed to making New Jersey a national model for inclusive and sustainable economic development by focusing on strategies that help build strong and dynamic communities, create good jobs for New Jersey residents, and provide pathways to a stronger and fairer economy. Through partnerships with a diverse range of stakeholders, the Authority creates and implements initiatives to enhance the economic vitality and quality of life in the State, and to strengthen New Jersey’s long-term economic competitiveness.\n\nGovernor Murphy’s Economic Development Strategic Plan, “The State of Innovation: Building a Stronger and Fairer Economy in New Jersey” specifically highlights investing in emerging innovative industries as critical to the State’s economic development strategy. The plan identifies Film & Digital Media as a strategic sector that has the potential for outsized growth over the next five to fifteen years where the State could use targeted initiatives to promote innovation and economic development within the sector. Additionally, the plan includes goals to create the most diverse innovation ecosystem in the country and close the racial and gender wage and employment gaps.\n\nNew Jersey has witnessed impressive growth in the film, television, and media industry, attracting multiple film studios and production companies with many high-profile productions being filmed in the state. This boom is due in large part to the State’s tax and other incentives including the Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program, the Studio Partners and Film-lease Partners Facilities designation programs, and the pilot Film and Digital Media Studio Infrastructure Program. Utilization of the state’s Film Tax Credit has increased substantially. In State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019, NJEDA made 4 awards resulting in $19.7 million of film production spend in the state. In SFY 2021, 24 awards resulted in $185.5 million spent in NJ. Those figures climbed to 56 awards totaling over $758 million of film production spend in SFY 2023. More information on these programs can be found at https://www.njeda.gov/film/.\n\nNotable highlights of this industry growth in the state include Lionsgate’s on-going construction in Newark of the first purpose-built studio in New Jersey to be constructed for TV and film production using tax credits (expected to open in 2025), Netflix’s planned construction of a studio complex in Monmouth County (2027-2028), and the proposed construction of 1888 Studios in Bayonne (recently designated a Film-Lease Partner Facility). The number of film projects and productions in New Jersey in 2024-2025 are expected to reach over 1,000, and the projected number of film-related jobs for 2024 is close to 15,000. These projects mark a pivotal moment in New Jersey’s evolution as an emerging force in film and television production. This RFI is a critical input into New Jersey’s efforts to further invest in the film, television, and digital media industry and build an inclusive and dynamic workforce to meet industry needs.\n\n3.
