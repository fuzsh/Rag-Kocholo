        "text": "Agency means any department, division, board, bureau, office, council, commission, authority, public benefit corporation having statewide responsibility, or a separate unit of the executive branch of state government created or established by law or executive order, but shall not include the Executive Chamber.\n\nArchives facility means a facility administered by the director for the preservation and controlled use of archival records transferred from agencies and the judiciary, or a facility that is approved by the director as having an equivalent capacity to ensure the physical security and control of archival records.\n\nState Archives means the organizational unit within the State Education Department which has responsibility to administer the State and local government archives and records management programs.\n\nCommissioner means the commissioner of education.\n\nDirector means the Assistant Commissioner of Education who is director of the State Archives.\n\nDisposition means the authorized action to dispose of the records of an agency or the judiciary by destruction, transfer to another agency or branch of government, or transfer to an archives facility.\n\nRecord series means a group of related records that result from the same activity and can be evaluated together for disposition and other management purposes. Usually, the records in a record series are arranged under a single filing system or are otherwise kept together as a unit.\n\nRecords means all books, papers, maps, photographs, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any agency of the state or by the judiciary in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities, or because of the information contained therein, but shall not include the records of the Executive Chamber. Library or museum material made or acquired and preserved solely for reference or exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience of reference, and stocks of publications and of blank forms shall not be deemed to constitute records.\n\nActive records means records that are frequently referenced or otherwise frequently used for conducting current business.\n\nArchival records means records that are designated by the director for continuous preservation because they have enduring administrative, legal, fiscal, educational, historical, or other research value to State government and/or its citizens. Such term is not used as a synonym for computer-generated records that are stored off-line.\n\nElectronic records means those records which are stored in a form that can be read or processed only by means of a computer.\n\nInactive records means records that are infrequently referenced or otherwise infrequently used for conducting current business.\n\nVital records means selected records which, in the event of a disaster, are essential to the resumption or continuation of government operations, to the re-creation of the legal and financial status of State government, or to the protection of and fulfillment of obligations to the citizens of the State. Such term is not used as a synonym for official birth, death, and marriage records.\n\nRecords center facility means a facility maintained by the director for the secure storage, servicing and protection of inactive records prior to their disposition by destruction transfer to another agency or branch of government, or transfer to an archives facility.\n\nRecords management means the planning, organizing, directing, controlling and other activities needed for effective records creation, records maintenance and use, and records disposition.\n\nRecords retention and disposition schedule means a document that prescribes the legally required minimum retention periods for records and the final disposition of records and may also describe where and in what form records must be kept.\n\nRetention period means a period of time, expressed in terms of an event which must occur and/or the time which must elapse, before records may be disposed.\n\nThe director shall administer the State Archives and State records center programs and facilities, shall provide records management training and technical assistance services to agencies, and shall approve the preservation and disposition of records, on behalf of the commissioner, according to procedures set forth in this Part.\n\nThe director shall institute a system for the review of agency records management plans and programs to determine agency compliance with the applicable provisions of this Part, to identify opportunities for improving agency records management programs and practices, to propose plans for records management assistance and advice, and to ensure the identification and preservation of archival records. Based on these reviews, the director shall prepare written findings for the commissioner, who shall thereupon report and make recommendations to the head of each respective agency and to the Director of Division of the Budget.\n\nAs part of this review, and with the understanding that State Archives staff shall not disclose confidential information contained in any agency records, the director may inspect the condition and assess the value of agency records which, in his or her opinion, are likely to be archival records. In lieu of physical inspection of records, the director shall obtain from an agency sufficient information about the general contents and uses of records to permit an evaluation of the research value of the records.\n\nNo agency shall destroy, transfer custody of, destroy the means to access, or otherwise dispose of any records without first having secured authorization to do so in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Part.\n\nRecords disposition authorizations that were issued pursuant to the provisions of former Section 186 of the State Finance Law, and that remained in effect when such law was repealed, continue in full force and effect unless modified or abrogated under applicable provisions of this Part.\n\nThe State Archives shall issue written guidelines to assist agency staff to distinguish between records and documentary materials that are not records.\n\nEach agency shall develop and carry out plans to compile and maintain an up-to-date inventory of all records in its custody. An inventory shall contain information sufficient to prepare and implement records retention and disposition schedules. At minimum, an inventory shall include the title, purpose, responsible program area, contents, arrangement, volume, dates and locations of all records series, and the hardware and software requirements for all electronic records.\n\nEach agency shall develop and carry out plans to obtain authorization from the State Archives for records retention and disposition schedules or plans governing all records in the agency. Agencies shall submit proposals to establish such schedules in a manner and form prescribed by the director. A proposal may be used to obtain ongoing disposal authorization for records which continue to accumulate or to obtain one-time disposal authorization for records which are discontinued.\n\nEach records disposition proposal must be reviewed by the agency records management officer for completeness and accuracy and be signed by the agency records management officer, whose signature shall constitute the agency's certification that the records listed in the proposal do not have sufficient administrative, legal, fiscal or other value to the agency to warrant their continued retention beyond the expiration of the proposed retention periods.\n\nGeneral records retention and disposition schedules may be issued by the State Archives to authorize the retention and disposition of records common to some or all agencies.\n\nAt least 40 days prior to issuance, the State Archives will forward a copy of a proposed general records schedule to the offices of the Attorney General and State Comptroller for their review. The Attorney General or a designee shall review the schedule to determine if proposed dispositions meet legal requirements. The State Comptroller or a designee shall review the schedule to determine if proposed dispositions meet fiscal and audit requirements. If either the Attorney General or State Comptroller, within 30 days after receiving a proposed schedule, shall advise the State Archives that any records should not be destroyed according to the proposed schedule, no authorization to destroy such records will be included on a general records retention and disposition schedule issued by the State Archives.\n\nEach agency records management officer shall inform the director in writing of the agency's intent to adopt and use a general records schedule. Adoption of a general records schedule eliminates the need for an agency to comply with the provisions of section 188.6 of this Part for those records included on the general records schedule. In the event of duplication of any record series between a general records retention and disposition schedule and an approved agency retention and disposition schedule, the provisions of the agency schedule shall prevail for that agency.\n\nWhenever an agency has in its custody any records that are considered by the records management officer of that agency to be in such a condition that they constitute a menace to human safety or health or to property, the records management officer of such agency may request from the director authorization to destroy or dispose of such records immediately, indicating the conditions which make such immediate destruction or disposal necessary.\n\nThe director, as soon as possible after receipt of an emergency request to destroy or dispose of records, shall advise the Attorney General and the State Comptroller, or their designees, of the need for the immediate destruction or disposal of the records in question.\n\nThe Attorney General and the State Comptroller, or their designees, when notified by the director of the request for emergency destruction of records, may immediately notify the director that they have no objection to the destruction or disposal proposed. Upon receiving such notification, the director may authorize the immediate destruction or disposal of such records.\n\nWhenever records are destroyed in whole or in part by fire or flood or as a result of any natural or manmade disaster, the records management officer of the agency responsible for the custody of the records so damaged or destroyed shall:\n\nnotify the director, as soon as practicable, as to the nature, type, and quantity of the records damaged or destroyed and the circumstances surrounding their damage or destruction;\n\ntake immediate steps to protect the damaged records from further deterioration in accordance with technical advice furnished by the State Archives;\n\ninitiate action, when appropriate and in accordance with technical advice from the State Archives, to retrieve, reassemble and reconstruct the information contained in the damaged or destroyed records.\n\nThe director, upon notification of damage or destruction of records by fire or flood or as the result of any natural or manmade disaster, shall advise the Attorney General and the State Comptroller of such damage or destruction.\n\nWithin 60 days after the fire or flood or natural or manmade disaster causing damage or destruction to records, the agency records management officer shall furnish the director with information about the nature, type, and quantity of records no longer available for use; and the types of information contained in those records.\n\nIf the records management officer of the agency responsible for the custody of the records considers that the damaged records can no longer be maintained to meet records retention requirements, the officer may apply to the director for permission to destroy the damaged records.& Such applications should be made by following the procedures indicated in section 188.6 or section 188.9 of this Part, as appropriate, including information describing the nature of the damage and justification for destroying the records. The director may authorize such destruction based upon evaluation of the damage incurred and the need for destruction of the records in question, in accordance with procedures indicated in sections 188.7 and 188.8 of this Part.\n\nThe director shall operate records center facilities to provide for the secure, cost-effective storage of inactive records; to provide secure storage for vital records, for master copies of microforms, for backup copies of electronic records, and for records that require special security or environmental conditions; and to provide records retrieval services at the request of the organizational unit which transferred the records. Records of agencies and the judiciary are eligible for storage at records center facilities.\n\nThe director, in accepting records of an agency or a unit of the judiciary for storage in a records center facility, assumes responsibility for the physical possession, storage, protection and servicing of such records and the security of the information contained in them, as an agent of the head of the agency or the official of the judiciary transferring such records.\n\nThe State Archives, acting for an agency storing records in a records center facility, shall be responsible for destroying records that are eligible for destruction pursuant to records disposition authorizations. The State Archives shall notify the agency records management officer at least 40 days prior to the intended destruction of agency records stored at a records center facility. Upon request of the agency records management officer, stating justification for continued retention of the records, the director may authorize the continued storage of the records for a specified period of time.\n\nAccess to records stored in and serviced at a records center facility will be permitted only as authorized in writing by the agency records management officer or the authorized representative of the unit of the judiciary transferring records to the facility. Such authorizations shall be in a manner and form prescribed by the director.\n\nEach agency or unit of the judiciary, when transferring records to a records center facility, shall indicate in writing such restrictions on the retrieval of records as the agency or unit of the judiciary desires or requires the director to enforce. The director shall take all necessary and proper actions to enforce such restrictions.\n\nThe State Archives will provide retrieval and refiling services for records stored in a records center facility. Requests for a record stored in a records center facility may be made in person, by telephone, or by mail in a manner and form prescribed by the director. The State Archives will release records only to authorized representatives of the agency or the unit of the judiciary which transferred the records.\n\nIn the event that the commissioner or the director is served with a court order or a subpoena, or a request for certification of authenticity, or a written request for access to records, or any legal process which relates to records stored in a records center facility, the commissioner or the director shall immediately notify the agency or the unit of the judiciary which transferred such records to the records center facility. It shall then be the duty of such agency or unit of the judiciary to respond to the order, request, or other legal process.\n\nNegative microphotographic film. When a microform will replace an original record having a legal minimum retention period of 10 years or longer and when the agency still must maintain it for at least 10 years to meet this requirement, or when the records being microphotographed are identified on a records retention and disposition schedule as having a permanent or archival retention period, only a polyester-based, black-and-white silver gelatin microform or Ilfochrome (formerly known as Cibachrome) color microform shall be used as the original camera negative film.\n\nPreservation of the camera negative. When a microform will replace an original record, the camera negative shall be used only to produce duplicate copies of the film. Once the duplicates have been made, the camera negative film must be placed in an offsite storage facility that meets standards established by the director for security, fire protection and environmental control to ensure the preservation of the information on the microform.\n\nMicroforms to meet quality standards. When a microform will replace an original record, the microform shall meet quality standards established by the director for resolution and density to ensure that the film and copies made from it will be clear and legible and to ensure the long-term viability of the film.\n\nTargeting and certification of microforms. When a microform will replace an original record, the following measures must be taken to ensure access to the information contained on the microform, and the quality and legal admissibility of the microform itself:\n\nThe records to be filmed shall be arranged and identified to ensure reasonable access to individual documents.\n\nEach discrete roll of original negative film and each discrete original negative fiche shall begin with a target identifying the records being filmed and certifying that the records are being filmed in the normal course of business. Each shall end with a signed declaration by the camera operator identifying the date of filming and the agency for which the film is being produced.\n\nIn addition, each roll of film must have the following targets at the beginning of the roll: density target, resolution target and start target.\n\nIn addition, each roll of film shall have an end target at the end of each roll.\n\nWhere needed, roll film shall contain retake and correction targets.\n\nInspection of microforms. A representative sample of all microforms shall be quality inspected to ensure that the film images meet quality standards set by the director. Each batch of processed film shall be tested to ensure that processing chemicals which could cause image deterioration are washed from the film. Film and film images that do not meet standards must be reshot before the original document may be destroyed.\n\nAn agency shall ensure that records retention requirements are incorporated into any plan and process for design, redesign, or substantial enhancement of an information system that stores electronic records.\n\nAn agency shall ensure that electronic records are not rendered unusable because of changing technology before their retention and preservation requirements are met. In the case of archival electronic records, an agency, in consultation with the State Archives, must determine that the records will remain usable and accessible by ensuring that the records are retained in currently available file formats and by creating adequate documentation of the records and their systems as defined in subdivision (c) of this section. If an agency cannot provide such protection to the records, it shall transfer the archival electronic records to the State Archives in a usable and accessible format.\n\nAn agency shall develop and maintain up-to-date documentation about all permanent or archival electronic records sufficient to:\n\nspecify all technical characteristics necessary for reading and processing the records;\n\nidentify all defined inputs and outputs from the system;\n\ndefine the contents of the files and records;\n\ndetermine restrictions on access and use;\n\nunderstand the purposes and functions of the system;\n\ndescribe update cycles and/or conditions and rules for adding information to the system, changing information in the system, or deleting information; and\n\nensure the ongoing retention of records by the agency or the authorized transfer of records to an archives facility.\n\nAn agency shall prepare and store in a records center copies of archival electronic records in order to safeguard against loss.\n\nFor electronic media that contain permanent or archival electronic records, an agency shall institute maintenance procedures to:\n\nverify that the media are free of potentially damaging errors;\n\nrewind under constant tension all tapes at least every two years;\n\nannually test a three percent statistical sample of all units of media to identify any loss of data and to discover and correct the causes of data loss;\n\ncopy immediately onto new media any permanent or archival electronic records stored on media containing a significant number of errors or showing signs of physical degradation;\n\ncopy all permanent or archival electronic records onto new media before the media are expected to fail and always before the media are 10 years old; and\n\nprepare external labels to identify each media unit, the name of the organizational unit responsible for the records, and the records title.\n\nEach agency shall pay to the State Education Department an annual fixed fee to support education and training, disposition analysis and review, technical assistance, and other records management advisory services provided by the State Archives. These fees are set on the basis of the total volume of records (active and inactive) in the custody of an agency; higher fees reflect a larger volume of records.

Records center facility storage fees will be assessed annually and are payable each State fiscal year. A waiver of the annual fixed fee may be granted if an agency's total State operations budget is less than $500,000 or if an agency no longer operates as an administratively separate unit of State government or if other extenuating circumstances exist that would make it unduly burdensome for an agency to pay such fee.\n\nThe State Archives may also establish fees for central micrographics and imaging services. Such fees shall reflect the actual cost of carrying out such services.\n\nRevenue generated as the result of contracts administered by the State Archives for the recycling or other authorized disposal by sale of bulk quantities of State government records authorized for destruction shall be payable to the State Education Department to support records management services provided by the State Archives.\n\nAt the request of the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals or a presiding justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court or the Chief Administrator of the Courts, the director shall review and recommend plans and procedures for the disposition of judicial records in order to identify and insure the preservation of those judicial records which warrant archival retention and administration. In carrying out this function for court records administered by local governments, the director also may consult with the New York State Local Government Records Advisory Council.\n\nArchival records of the Unified Court System may be transferred to the State Archives. Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, such archival judicial records shall be administered and made available for public use according to conditions mutually agreed upon by the director and the Chief Judge for records of the Court of Appeals; a presiding justice for records of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court; and the Chief Administrator of the Courts for all other records of the Unified Court System.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, executive chamber records are defined as all books, papers, microforms, computer-readable tapes, discs or other media, maps, photographs, film, video and sound recordings, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by the Governor and his or her Executive Chamber staff, or made by the Governor and Executive Chamber staff and transmitted by them to the office of the head or governing body of any agency, in connection with the transaction of public business, and retained by the Governor and his or her staff or an agency head or governing body or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities, or because of the information contained therein.

Archival records shall be available during normal business hours for use by any individual subject to procedures needed to ensure the security and preservation of the records. Catalogs, inventories, lists, and other finding aids describing records in the State Archives are available to assist researchers.\n\nRequests to inspect or to obtain copies of archival records may be made orally or in writing. The records access officer shall have the right to require that any request shall be in writing in a form prescribed by the records access officer.\n\nThe records access officer reserves the right to review requested records and to withhold access to records or portions of records that may be exempted from public disclosure by subdivision 2 of section 87 of the Public Officers Law (Freedom of Information Law).\n\nThe records access officer shall not restrict or deny access to any records more than 75 years old, except pursuant to statutory provisions which explicitly prohibit access to the records.\n\nThe director may establish conditions to permit controlled access to certain records in the State Archives which may be exempt from disclosure under law, provided that there are no statutory provisions which explicitly prohibit access to the records.
