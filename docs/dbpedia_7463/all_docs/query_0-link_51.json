        "text": "About Steve\n\n​​​“A lot has changed in the thirty-five years since I was first elected to the State Legislature. One thing that hasn't changed is the desire of the citizens to be heard by their elected officials,\" said Geller.\n\n​Commissioner Geller's top priority is bringing high-paying jobs to Broward County. The Commissioner is a strong supporter of organized labor and holds Building Trades Meetings quarterly year-round because he believes that our Country is stronger when there is a strong middle class and strong labor movement, both public and private. Commissioner Geller has taken the lead in advocating for the growing film and entertainment industry in Broward County and was crucial in creating Broward County's new Film Commission Office in 2021.\n\nSince the release of the new Film Incentive Program initiated by Commissioner Geller, Fort Lauderdale is now listed as one of the best places to live and work in film, according to MovieMaker.​\n\nCommissioner Geller currently chairs the South Florida Regional Planning Council, the Water Advisory Board, and serves on the Cultural Council in Broward County.\n\nLooking forward, Commissioner Geller will use his unmatched expertise and experience to build public/private partnerships between business and educational institutions, protect Broward County's fragile environment, and forge a strong connection with District 5 residents through town hall meetings, transparency in government and continued dedication to public service.\n\nCommissioner Geller keeps an active newsletter that sends out biweekly updates and has a social media presence on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram."
