From Donegal to Cork, we were offered crucial on-the-ground assistance with access and permits, along with essential local insight. We received an all-inclusive service, complete with discretion and absolute professionalism.”\n\nMally Chung, Location Manager, Star Wars: Episode 8 – The Last Jedi\n\nFilming\n\nWe recommend using a professional Location Manager on your production when filming in Ireland.

They will also provide a great source of local knowledge. The Location Guild of Ireland list members for your convenience.\n\nIf you are filming on private property, you will require the owner’s permission and consent. It is normal practice to have a location agreement signed by both the Production Company and Owner prior to filming. Appropriate insurances should also be in place.\n\nIf intending on filming in a public location you will need to obtain appropriate licences from the relevant local authority or any other authority in control of such spaces. It is recommended that the production company informs An Garda Síochána of all details of filming on the street or in a public place. This includes any staging of crimes, accidents or use of firearms and special effects if they take place in the public domain.\n\nThe production company should ensure that all those affected by filming are consulted and informed of production arrangements in advance.\n\nThere will be times when it is prudent to have members of An Garda Síochána in attendance to ensure efficient traffic management while filming on location. A Location Manager or other designated crew member is required to communicate with the Garda Síochána Commissioner and local council, who will advise on the need for Garda assistance at any given film location.\n\nGarda personnel assigned through the Office of the Garda Assistant Commissioner are at all times operating under the direction of Garda Management and not the production company that requested Garda assistance. All non-public duty Garda costs incurred will be borne by the production company.

All regulations made there under, and all other relevant legislation, regulations and approved Codes of Practice, to ensure the safe running of this production.\n\nThe health and safety of cast, crew and public must be safeguarded at all times. It is the responsibility of the production company to ensure safety standards are maintained at all time and filming should be stopped with immediate effect if it is unsafe to continue filming.\n\nCrew members and production personnel working on site must wear the correct personal protective gear appropriate to their tasks and duties on location.\n\nFurther guidance on health and safety across all departments on a production can be found in our Health & Safety Guidance Document.\n\nMore detailed information on filming in Ireland can be found in our toolkit.\n\nGarda\n\nIt a recommended that you inform local police for ALL exterior location filming, which for example, for any filming in a public place in Dublin is the Garda Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region, Harcourt Street Headquarters.
