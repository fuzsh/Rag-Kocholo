Welcome to our screening submission portal.

The screening process is a valuable component in our organization’s effort to maintain the security and safety of all participants. This easy and secure process will allow you to provide all of the information necessary to complete your background report. The report used by our organization is limited to the scope of the searches listed below.

To access the portal, enter the password which was provided within your STS Foundation application (shown on Background Check tab of your application), then click on “Start your Background Check”. Note: this is not the password you created for your personal STSF application.
