        "text": "Richard Fikes\n\nProfessor (Research) Emeritus, Computer Science Department\n\nArtificial Intelligence Laboratory\n\nStanford University\n\nSummary\n\nRichard Fikes has a long and distinguished record as an innovative leader in the development of techniques for effectively representing and using knowledge in computer systems. He is best known as co-developer of the STRIPS automatic planning system, KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format), the Ontolingua ontology representation language and Web-based ontology development environment, the OKBC (Open Knowledge Base Connectivity) API for knowledge servers, and IntelliCorp's KEE system. At Stanford, he led projects focused on developing large-scale distributed repositories of computer-interpretable knowledge, collaborative development of multi-use ontologies, enabling technology for the Semantic Web, reasoning methods applicable to large-scale knowledge bases, and knowledge-based technology for intelligence analysts. He was principal investigator of major projects for multiple Federal Government agencies including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Intelligence Community’s Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA).\n\nAcademic History\n\nColleges and universities attended, degrees received, and dates:\n\nPh.D. Computer Science Carnegie-Mellon University 1968\n\nM.A. Mathematics University of Texas at Austin 1965\n\nB.A. Mathematics University of Texas at Austin 1963\n\nEmployment History\n\nAcademic\n\nJuly 2006 – present Professor (Research) Emeritus, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nJune 1991 – June 2006 Professor (Research), Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nJanuary 1999 – June 2006 Director, Knowledge Systems Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nJuly 1991 - January 1999 Co-Scientific Director, Knowledge Systems Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nMarch 1991 to July 1991 Associate Director, Heuristic Programming Project, Knowledge Systems Laboratory, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nMarch 1991 - May 1991 Consulting Professor, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\n1982 Visiting Professor, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA\n\n1970 – 1971 Visiting Professor, Computer Science Department, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n\nSeptember 1968 - September 1969 Research Associate, Computer Science Department, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA\n\nNon Academic\n\nSeptember 1990 to February 1991 Chief Scientist, Price Waterhouse Technology Centre, Menlo Park, CA\n\nJune 1989 to August 1990 Director, Knowledge-Based Systems Program, Price Waterhouse Technology Centre, Menlo Park, CA\n\nNovember 1987 to May 1989 Principal Scientist, Price Waterhouse Technology Centre, Menlo Park, CA\n\nApril 1986 to October 31, 1987 Vice President of Research, IntelliCorp Inc., Mountain View, CA\n\nNovember 1983 to April 1986 Director of Research and Development, IntelliCorp Inc., Mountain View, CA\n\nNovember 1976 to November 1983 Member of Research Staff, Computer Science Laboratory (1976-79), System Sciences Laboratory (1979-80), Cognitive and Instructional Sciences Group (1980-83), Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, CA\n\nSeptember 1969 to November 1976 Senior Mathematician, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, SRI International, Menlo Park, CA\n\nProfessional Service\n\nStanford Committees\n\nAwards, 2001-2006\n\nMS program and admissions committee, 2000-2006\n\nGates Building Space Czar, 1999-2006\n\nPh.D. Program Committee, 1996-1999\n\nGates Building Committee, 1993-1995, 1999\n\nPh.D. Admissions Committee, 1992-1995, 1999\n\nSST Faculty Search Committee, 1997-1998\n\nResearch Administration Advisory Group (RAAG), 1997-1998\n\nAI Ph.D. qualifying exam committee, 1997\n\nComputer Forum symposium program committee, 1993-1994\n\nProposal Review Committee, Stanford Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE), 1991-93.\n\nEditorships\n\nMember, Editorial Board of International Journal of Intelligent Systems in Accounting Finance & Management, 1992-present\n\nReferee for Artificial Intelligence Journal, IEEE Expert, and Journal of Automated Reasoning, 1988-2006\n\nMember, Editorial Board of AAAI Press, 1989\n\nMember, Editorial Board of Decision Support Systems Journal, 1984\n\nNewsletter Editor, SIGART, 1972-1974\n\nConference, workshop and professional society participation\n\nCo-Chairman, Ontologies for the Semantic Web workshop, AAAI 2002 National Conference, 2002.\n\nOrganizing Committee, AAAI Spring Symposium on “Mining Answers from Texts and Knowledge Bases”, March 2002.\n\nMember, program committee, “2nd International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2003)”, 2003.\n\nMember, program committee, “1st International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2002)”, 2002.\n\nDARPA ISAT Analyst’s Associate ad hoc working group, 2002.\n\nMember, program committee, “Eighth International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2002)”, 2002.\n\nMember, program committee, “Seventh International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2000)”, 2000.\n\nMember, program committee, \"Autonomous Agents '98\" conference, 1998.\n\nMember, program committee, \"International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS’98)\", 1998.\n\nMember, organizing committee of symposium on \"Formalizing Contexts\", AAAI 1995 Fall Symposium Series, 1995.\n\nMember, International Honorary Committee, First World Congress on Intelligent Manufacturing Processes & Systems, 1995.\n\nCo-Chair, ARPA workshop on Ontology Development and Use, 1994.\n\nProgram co-chair, 11th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1993.\n\nMember, program committee, International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning;
