Several states have adopted new laws, with more states considering similar actions in the coming months. Below is a summary of the changes as of May 1st, 2021.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n2. Where the U.S. Currently Stands on Ban the Box Laws\n\nOn a federal level, legislation intended to ban the question about criminal records on all job applications was introduced in Congress in 2012 and was tabled, but with no vote taken. While the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) designated exclusion of a criminal record box as a best practice for equitable hiring. The EEOC recommendations relate to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), or national origin.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n3. How to Use a SWOT Analysis to Audit Your HR Department\n\nHR leaders are very familiar with company audits, risk assessments, and gap analyses for skills, talent, and hiring needs. However, you don’t always take the time to audit your own department, identify potential risks and opportunities to strengthen resources, and ensure compliance best practices.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n4. Top HR Trends for 2021\n\nMany are looking to the COVID-19 vaccines to bring the world “back to normal.” But even once the virus is under control, we’re all coming out of this permanently changed. And few professions have undergone a drastic transformation like human resources. We’ve handled changes in practice, process and place of work, and the profession is still evolving.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n5. Privacy and Data Security Factors When Global Background Screening\n\nBackground checks and other forms of pre-employment screening are being increasingly adopted around the world and have become standard and/or mandatory for job candidates that apply to regulated industries or companies that handle sensitive data. While commonplace in America, the concept of screening is still unfamiliar to many employers in Europe, Asia, and beyond. As the marketplace becomes more global in scope, conducting checks on an international basis means that organizations need to gain a comprehensive understanding of the globally diverse safeguards for the protection of personal data privacy and data transfer security.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n6. California Criminal Record Reporting Changes For Employers in 2021\n\nA proposed bill may make it easier for those arrested and convicted to find work and housing in California starting in January of 2021. AB 2978, introduced in February of 2020, would require the Department of Justice to review criminal files and identify people who may be eligible for record relief if the arrest or conviction happened on or after January 1, 1973.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n7. What Employers Can Do Now About the ‘Pink Collar Recession’\n\nBefore we were hit with an economic shutdown from the pandemic, there were nearly 10 million mothers of young children in the labor force in 2019. In March of 2020, many employers furloughed, laid off, restructured, and shifted to remote work. Over 1.1 million people left the workforce between August and September of 2020, and most of them were women — approximately 865,000 women compared with 216,000 men.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n8. What Automatic Criminal Record Expungement Means for Employers\n\nAccording to the SentencingProject.org, nearly one in three adults in the U.S.—or 70 million Americans—have a criminal record, including those who were arrested but not convicted. For many of these individuals, a criminal record creates a significant barrier to employment, even when the record includes only a misdemeanor arrest or conviction. Regardless of their qualifications, people with criminal records struggle to participate in the American workforce and contribute to their families and society. There’s a cost for employers as well, who are unable to benefit from the talents of tens of millions of qualified candidates.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n9. How Blockchain is Changing and Shaping the Global Labor Market\n\nWith more companies shifting to a fully or partially remote workforce, the importance of accurate, secure and accessible data is in the spotlight. This is especially crucial when it comes to background and reference checks across a global marketplace. In January of 2020, our parent company Cisive joined 14 leading, enterprise multinational labor market organizations to launch the Velocity Network Foundation (VNF). VNF is a collaborative, vendor-neutral, nonprofit organization established to define, deploy, and champion the Velocity Network: a globally accessible, trustworthy “Internet of Careers” powered by innovative blockchain technology in response to growing data privacy, security, and market pressures.\n\nClick here to read the full article\n\n10. Velocity Network Foundation and the Future of Employment Screening\n\nToday’s typical background screening process occupies considerable time and administrative resources. Waiting three to five days for transcripts or background screening reports slows down your time-to-hire and allows the competition to snatch up your top talent.\n\nLeaders in background screening practices and organizational risk management have come together in the Velocity Network Foundation to change that. Velocity’s disruptive technology is poised to change the way employers screen candidates and monitor employee credentials in highly regulated verticals such as financial services, healthcare, and transportation."
