        "text": "Rotary District 5340 Youth Certification Instructions\n\nThe safety and well-being of Participants, Minor or Adult, in each Rotary Youth Program is every Rotarianâs priority. The fundamentals for protecting Participants are set forth in the District 5340 Youth Protection Policy (âYPPâ). Click here to review the YPP for your protection as well as the protection of other Participants in Rotary Youth Programs. The capitalized words and other terms used in these instructions are defined in Article 2 of the YPP.\n\nEvery Volunteer who works with Minors in California is required by law to (1) take training in protecting Minors from abuse and neglect and (2) have a Live Scan (fingerprint) background check. In addition, the District requires a Volunteer to submit a Volunteer Application. When you have accomplished all three of these requirements, the District will notify you either (i) that you are Youth Certified (âYCâ) and are able to work with Minors in Rotary Youth Programs or (ii) that you are not YC and how you can challenge the Districtâs decision.\n\nThese requirements to become YC are effective immediately. Current YC designations obtained without completing all 3 Steps below, will continue to be effective until March 1, 2023, at which time all current Volunteers will need to recertify by complying in full with these requirements.\n\nIf you obtained your current YC designation after July 1, 2022 and completed any of the 3 Steps below, you only need to complete the remaining Step(s) to become YC under the new requirements. If you are uncertain about what is required, you may contact Doug Clements, District 5340 Youth Protection Officer, at ypo@rotary5340.org or (858) 487-8617.\n\nInstructions for all Volunteers to Become YC\n\nEvery Volunteer must complete all 3 steps below to become YC. The steps may be completed in any order or simultaneously, but the YC date, for all purposes, will be the date the Live Scan background check was completed successfully.\n\nStep 1 â Complete the Application\n\nClick here to download the District 5340 Youth Program Volunteer Application and complete it on your computer. Print the completed Application, sign it, scan it to a PDF file, and email the PDF to YPO@Rotary5340.org.\n\nStep 2 â Take the Online Training\n\nCalifornia law requires every Volunteer in a Rotary Youth Program to have training on how to recognize child abuse and neglect and to have training on how to report known, suspected, or alleged incidents of child abuse and neglect. The online training is free and can be reviewed at any time. The online training is through the California Department of Social Services. The particular training course you must take is determined by your level of involvement in Rotary Youth Programs.\n\nVolunteers who participate in but do not organize and/or administer Rotary Youth Programs (e.g., RYLA Facilitators, YE Volunteers, Interact Advisors, or school reading program volunteers) must take the CA Volunteer training. Go to https://mandatedreporterca.com/; click on Register/Sign In; click on Sign Up; click on Volunteers; click on Next; finish the registration process; and complete the Volunteers training. You will receive a Certificate upon completion of the training. Email your Certificate to the District Youth Protection Officer at YPO@rotary5340.org.\n\nVolunteers who are organizers and/or administrators of Rotary Youth Programs (e.g., District or club committee members for RYLA, YE, Interact, or school reading programs) are Mandated Reporters and must take the CA Mandated Reporter training. Go to https://mandatedreporterca.com/; click on Register/Sign In; click on Sign Up; click on General Training; click on Next; finish the registration process; complete the General Training; and take the test. You can download a Certificate upon passing the test. Email your Certificate to the District Youth Protection Officer at YPO@rotary5340.org.\n\nStep 3 â Get a Live Scan Background Check\n\nCalifornia law requires every Volunteer in a Rotary Youth Program to have a fingerprint-based Live Scan background check to protect the participating Minors. A Volunteerâs fingerprints will be sent to both the CA Department of Justice (âDOJâ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") to check the Volunteerâs criminal history records. A report of both investigations is generally available within 48 hours and will be kept by the DOJ. The District will have access to the report but will not keep any information locally except for the date of the report. There is a procedure for prospective Volunteers to challenge results that do not appear to be accurate or complete.\n\nClick here to download the DOJ Request for Live Scan Service Form BCIA 8016.\n\nComplete only the Applicant Information section of the Form (ignore the Billing Number and Misc. Number), sign the form, and date the form.\n\nDo not modify any other information on the Form.\n\nBecause Rotary is a not-for-profit organization, the DOJ waives its fee for the background check. The FBI criminal history records check fee is $15. The total fee you should pay at the time your fingerprints are taken is $15 plus the fee charged by the Live Scan operator you select. Live Scan operator fees are not set by law and may vary widely. Typical fees in San Diego are $20 to $30 but may be twice that or more. It is advised that you call ahead to verify the fee that will be charged. To locate a Live Scan operator whose fees you are willing to pay, go to https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations, click on your county, search for $20, then $21, then $22, etc., until you find a location and fee that meet your needs.\n\nTake page 1 of the Form to the Live Scan operator of your choice along with your Driverâs License and method of payment. Some Live Scan operators require cash for some or all of the payment, so check before you go. You must go to a Live Scan Operator located in the State of California. Out of state Volunteers must come to California to have their fingerprints taken even though their state may have Live Scan operators.\n\nYE Volunteers Only â Additional IntelliCorp Background Check Instructions\n\nEvery Volunteer who works in the Youth Exchange program must become YC by the District as set forth above. In addition, the Youth Exchange program requires that a YE Volunteer must also have an additional background check through IntelliCorp. The District only receives an automatic pass or no pass notification regarding the background check and does not see the results.\n\nYou will need to have your driverâs license, Social Security Number, and a credit card before beginning this process.\n\nThe typical cost is around $15 but may be higher depending upon which jurisdictionsâ records must be reviewed.\n\nClick on the IntelliCorp background check link,https://youthcertify.candidatedirect.net, and enter the following password: rotary5340 (all small case).\n\nFollow the online instructions to authorize your background check and to make secure payment.\n\nSelect the âreturn results to meâ option, as that will let you review your results.\n\nExpiration and Renewal of YC Status or YE Volunteer Status\n\nThe YC status of a Volunteer, including a YE Volunteer, will expire 5 years after the most recent date of becoming YC. To renew their status as YC, a Volunteer must complete all three of the steps above for Volunteers to become YC (i.e., submit a new District 5340 Youth Program Volunteer Application, submit a Certificate after retaking the online training through the California Department of Social Services, and have a Live Scan FBI background check).\n\nStatus as a YE Volunteer, for all purposes, will expire on the earlier of the date the YE Volunteerâs YC status expires or 1 year following the date the most recent Intellicorp background check was passed. To renew their status as YE Volunteer, a Volunteer, must be a YC Volunteer and complete all of the additional requirements to be approved as a YE Volunteer by the District Youth Exchange Committee (including having an IntelliCorp background check).\n\nHow to Determine if You Are Able to Participate in a Rotary Youth Program\n\nIf you are a Volunteer in any Rotary Youth Program or activity except Youth Exchange (e.g., RYLA, LEAD, Model UN, Camp Enterprise, Interact, Rotaract, 4-Way Test Speech Contest, school reading or other enrichment programs, etc.), then you must be YC and your DOJ and FBI background check must have been completed within the 60-month period immediately preceding each day of participation in the Rotary Youth Program or activity.\n\nIf you are a Volunteer in Youth Exchange, then (1) you must be YC, and your Live Scan DOJ and FBI background check must have been completed within the 60-month period immediately preceding each day of participation in Youth Exchange and (2) your IntelliCorp background check must have been completed within the 1-year period immediately preceding each day of participation in Youth Exchange.\n\nYou can see if you are YC and when you completed the last background check(s) by doing the following: Click here to go to the Member Login screen of the District website; enter your âLogin Nameâ and âPasswordâ (if you donât know them, follow the instructions for âForgot login name?â and/or âForgot password?â); click âLoginâ; click âMember Areaâ (upper right corner); in the blue menu bar select âDocumentsâ; in the grey menu bar select âDocumentsâ; select the âYouth Certificationâ folder; and select the âYouth Certification Spreadsheetâ to see your status.\n\nQuestions\n\nIf you have questions, please contact Doug Clements (Rotary Club of Valley Center), the District 5340 Youth Protection Officer, at ypo@rotary5340.org or (858) 487-8617."
