        "text": "Information technology (IT) is widely understood to be the enabling technology of the 21st century. IT has transformed, and continues to transform, all aspects of our lives: commerce and finance, education, energy, health care, manufacturing, government, national security, transportation, communications, entertainment, science, and engineering. IT and its impact on the U.S. economy—both directly (the IT sector itself) and indirectly (other sectors that are powered by advances in IT)—continue to grow in size and importance.\n\nIT’s impacts on the U.S. economy—both directly (the IT sector itself) and indirectly (other sectors that are powered by advances in IT)—continue to grow. IT enabled innovation and advances in IT products and services draw on a deep tradition of research and rely on sustained investment and a uniquely strong partnership in the United States among government, industry, and universities. Past returns on federal investments in IT research have been extraordinary for both U.S. society and the U.S. economy. This IT innovation ecosystem fuels a virtuous cycle of innovation with growing economic impact.\n\nBuilding on previous National Academies work, this report describes key features of the IT research ecosystem that fuel IT innovation and foster widespread and longstanding impact across the U.S. economy. In addition to presenting established computing research areas and industry sectors, it also considers emerging candidates in both categories.\n\nREAD FREE ONLINE"
