Although Rentec Direct includes all major features and functionality available in other software options, Rentec Direct purposefully maintains a lower price point than many competitors because Rentec Direct believes that all landlords and property managers should have access to the best software available regardless of their portfolio size. Rentec Direct is able to accomplish this because we are wholly owned, debt free, and as such do not have revenue requirements from investors. Our roots started with smaller landlords who generally cannot afford the premium prices and minimums found elsewhere and we're committed to all of our customers regardless of size. Rentec Direct works extremely well for both the startup DIY landlord as well as the professional property manager actively growing their portfolio into many thousands of units."
