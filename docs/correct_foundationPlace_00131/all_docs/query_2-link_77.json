        "text": "Did you know that in most recruitments, 46% of reference and credential verifications indicated a discrepancy between the information given by applicants and what the screening revealed?\n\nYou screen applicants to make sure they are qualified and that they will fit in with your company’s culture. But screening alone isn’t enough; you also have to conduct detailed background checks.\n\nBackground checks are essential because they allow you to determine whether your potential employees have a clean record, so you won’t encounter a lot of problems with them down the road. Conducting background checks is easy as long as you know what background check software to rely on. That’s where background check software comes in!\n\nA candidate background check can be a very important part of the hiring process. There are numerous benefits of conducting a candidate background check for staffing and recruitment agencies –\n\n1. Hiring temporary employees\n\nHiring temporary employees without background checks can be disastrous for staffing agencies. Not screening out offenders can lead to legal action, damage to reputation, and costly punitive action. Background-checking services are necessary to verify the authenticity of candidate information and to prevent future issues.\n\n2. Verifying candidate information\n\nRecruiters must verify the accuracy of candidate information provided on resumes. Candidates often include or omit certain information in their CVs, such as criminal records, previous employment, and educational qualifications. Background-checking services can help ensure that candidates are qualified and trustworthy.\n\n3. Preventing data security breaches\n\nIn today’s world, data security is a significant concern for companies. Background checks of temporary employees are necessary for preventing data security breaches and protecting customer privacy. Recruiters and staffing agencies can help ensure that only designated employees have access to sensitive data.\n\nAlso, check Best Recruitment CRM Software for Recruitment Agencies\n\n4.
