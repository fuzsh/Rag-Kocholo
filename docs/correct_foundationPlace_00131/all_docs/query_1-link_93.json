        "text": "Wild Canyon Discovery's program leaders have all had background\n\nchecks before being approved to volunteer as camp leaders.\n\n​\n\nWe have General Liability insurance for our programs, Director and\n\nOfficer insurance coverage for our Board of Directors and\n\nOrganization Officers and accident insurance for our volunteers.\n\n​\n\nOur activity leaders are Wilderness First Responders with\n\nyears of outdoor recreation and outdoor activity experience.\n\n​\n\nWe are able to offer these transformative outdoor experiences at affordable\n\nprices because of the generous contributions of our business and individual sponsors and most recently because of a $4000 grant from the Swantz Family Foundation.\n\n​\n\nWe are also looking for more volunteers willing to share their time and\n\noutdoor knowledge with the next generation of youth.\n\n​\n\nEach volunteer needs to be willing to complete a free background\n\ncheck done through Intellicorp.net\n\n​\n\nOutdoor Adventure Club at Page High School\n\nWild Canyon Discovery partnered with Page High School during the\n\n2021-2022 to have outdoor activities and outings with the high school club members.\n\nSome of the goals of the Outdoor Adventure Club were to provide opportunities, during the school year for Page High School students to experience and enjoy the environment around them and to help promote outdoor etiquette and\n\nstewardship of natural resources.\n\nWe really appreciate the time and work put in by the club co-sponsors,\n\nAnne Cambridge and Benjamin Dalton!\n\nThe club members went hiking on the Page Rim Trail, played pickleball, disk golf,\n\nand kayaked and paddle boarded at Lake Powell in October and in March.\n\nThe club members went with Dixie's Lower Antelope\n\nCanyon Tours in January at no charge.\n\nIn April, club members went on a paddle adventure on\n\nthe Colorado River in Glen Canyon. We received a free backhaul ten miles up\n\nriver to Petroglyph Beach from Wilderness River Adventures,\n\nHorseshoe Bend Rafting and floated on kayaks and paddle boards back\n\ndown river, through Horseshoe Bend, to Lee's Ferry.\n\nThe last adventure of the school year was going to the\n\ngreat climbing facility in Page, AZ called Canyon Walls.\n\nThe students got to climb, wear climbing harnesses, practice their new\n\nclimbing skills and they learned to belay for each other.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWild Canyon Adventure Club meets weekly in Big Water, UT\n\nThis program is for kids ages 7-14. Weekly club adventures, from\n\nOctober to May, vary and include cooperative games, treasure hunts, obstacle courses, basic survival skills training, map making and reading, trash pickup, nature awareness and appreciation activities, outdoor ethics, and much more.\n\n​\n\nThis program gives kids an opportunity to get outside and activate their bodies and senses through exciting, real adventures! They’ll be free to run, jump, and engage in guided play in the local wild canyons. This club can help them become more comfortable and confident outdoors, helping lay a strong foundation of respect for the earth and all other life, while developing a connection\n\nthe local environment and community."
