Vice President, Business Development, IntelliCorp Dave holds over 20 years of automated business process functional testing experience, specializing in the SAP packaged application market. 2\n\n3. HOUSEKEEPING • Questions are welcome throughout the presentation • All attendees and registrants will receive the recording, slides, and white paper. Follow us on Twitter and LinkedIn @turnkeydenver https://www.linkedin.com/company/ turnkey-solutions and @livecompare https://www.linkedin.com/company/intellicorp 3\n\n4. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare AGENDA At the highest level, companies must: 1. Understand the full impact of the change(s) across the organization 2. Pinpoint relevant test assets and identify gaps in coverage 3. Create and update appropriate test sets and data 4. Validate the test assets that changed before it goes into production 5. Test. (Using automated testing, of course.) But test only what matters most. 4\n\n5. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare SAP LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT TESTING CHALLENGE Automated Testing Process Owners Manual Testing Lack of Comprehensive Requirements High Quality High Velocity Low Risk Low Cost Constant Change 5\n\n6. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare TESTING DILEMMA FOR SAP USERS • Funding for QA resources continues to diminish each year • Requirements, a key component of testing are either non-existent or severely outdated • High incidents (defects) for each go-live have become the accepted norm 6 In the face of these facts how do QA teams accomplish the goal of quality? Change the paradigm – change the approach Focus on the change and test only the things that change\n\n7. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare THE CHALLENGE IS HUGE EHP7 Upgrade (a typical example of a major upgrade) 948 Support Pack Transports 3,953,759 Transport objects 7 What will be impacted? What do we test? Do we have test coverage? What are our gaps?\n\n8. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare THE NEED FOR SMART IMPACT ANALYSIS 8 VA01 (Create Sales Order) Depth=2 Links=19,242\n\n9. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare TESTABLE OBJECTS 9\n\n10. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare WHY SAP CUSTOMERS USE LIVECOMPARE 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Used Impacted Most-at-Risk • 323 10 1222 1930 968 1302 156 Custom Standard 15 Customers SAP Support Pack\n\n11. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare SMART IMPACT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD 11\n\n12. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare HOTSPOT ALGORITHM PROFILES – PREDICT WHERE TO FOCUS 12\n\n13. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare SMART IMG CONFIGURATION COMPARISON 13 CD2 CQ1Live Comparison • Select any node or sub-node of the IMG tree • LiveCompare finds and compares all config.

NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO TEST, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE TO TEST… LET’S TALK ABOUT AUTOMATION\n\n16. WHERE DO THE CHALLENGES BEGIN?\n\n17. AUTOMATED TESTING CHALLENGES Record and Playback Technology Time consuming to run through every possible process flow to create scenarios, requires programming skills to create and maintain the scripts. Keeping Automation Test Cases Up-To-Date Faster development cycles and business changes require on-going maintenance and up-to-date test cases (family packs, enhancements, customizations, patches, etc.) Staffing The Necessary Testing Resources It takes someone with a technical skill set to properly build and maintain test automation with traditional tools and those resources are hard to find. Minimal automated test coverage Business process complexity leads to many test scenarios resulting in low test coverage introducing significant business risk\n\n18. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare AUTOMATED TESTING CHALLENGES CONTINUED 18 Cost of Testing Testing is becoming an increasingly larger part of IT project costs End-To-End Business Processes Can Cross Many Platforms And Applications Results in limited or incomplete automated tests Managing Reporting, Test Plans, Test History, Compliance Is Challenging Testing tools not easily integrated with test management Resource Inefficiencies People who know QA tools do not know the business process and people who know the business process do not know the QA tools …need to staff both roles\n\n19. turnkeysolutions.com @turnkeydenver | intellicorp.com @livecompare WHAT ARE THE TOP CHALLENGES YOU FACE AS A TESTER? 19 September 2015 by EuroSTAR Community Team Other Maintainable test automation Merging / combining different test approaches Transitioning to agile Cloud based testing Security Developing better products Scalability Prioritizing what to test Internal test team issues–negativity, bad testers, motivation Implementing test process improvements Resources – time, money, people, technology Scope creep / incomplete or changing requirements Adapting to an evolving environment / new technologies Allocating responsibility Communicating to management and other teams\n\n20. Manual testing is so time-consuming, technical and expensive that only 15% - 20% gets automated during the first test cycle and the rest of the test cycles are spent maintaining the old tests ™ HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY MOST COMPANIES NEVER GET PAST 15-20% AUTOMATION?\n\n21. SAP... A GREATER CHALLENGE Change is Constant ERP applications are in a constant state of change; (upgrades, family packs, transports, enhancements, customizations, patches, etc.) Metadata Based A single change in the application or the metadata can unexpectedly affect multiple different parts of the application. Mission Critical - Business Process Complexity Validating a single business process requires testing numerous data scenarios (approvals, routing, authorizations, contracts, currency, etc.) Highly Customized Heterogeneous Environments End-to-end business processes typically span multiple technologies that can include packaged, legacy and custom applications.\n\n22. AN AUTOMATION SOLUTION SHOULD BE… • Proactively understand the impact of transports on target systems • Instantaneously understand the impact of transports to your SAP landscape and the impact/risk to key business functions. • Mitigate risk by pinpointing relevant test assets and identifying gaps in coverage • Automatically determine what test assets should be executed based on risk analysis and identify early the gaps where updates need to occur in framework to ensure proper coverage. • Rapidly create and update appropriate test sets and data • Eliminates the manual creation of scripts by letting non-technical users click through their application screens and use drag & drop technologies. • Allows users to view and apply changes to test cases without technical resources and literally update thousands of test sets with the push of a button. • Efficiently validate the test assets that changed before it goes into production • Uses data-driven technology to enable users to create test flows covering all possible test scenarios • Maximizes test coverage with the fewest possible test cases required."
