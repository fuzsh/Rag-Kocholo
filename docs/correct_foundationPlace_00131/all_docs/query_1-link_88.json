        "text": "Protecting the Children - Protecting the Church - Protecting Yourself\n\nUnfortunately, sexual misconduct against children is a growing problem in our country, and yes, even in the Church. Southern Mutual Church Insurance offers liability coverage to protect churches after an incident has occurred. However, we want to help churches prevent the abuse from happening in the first place. We have committed to providing this help in several ways.\n\nFirst, download the Child Youth Protection Manual, or click the link at the bottom. This manual is full of useful tips your church can use as safeguards for your children. There are also several ready-to-use forms, such as an evaluation checklist and a volunteer worker application. This manual is free and we encourage you to save it and print as many copies as you need.\n\nSecond, we have several representatives ready to present our Child and Youth Protection Workshop to your church leaders and volunteers. This hour long workshop will equip you with the information you need to start a prevention program at your church or enhance the one you already have in place. Please contact Matthew Quinton at 803-776-9365 to make an appointment.\n\nWe are pleased to recommend Intellicorp as a resource for purchasing background checks on volunteers, employees and staff members at a discounted price. For more information on services available, pricing, and ordering instructions, please visit the link below.\n\nIntellicorp Protect My Ministry Child Youth Protection Manual\n\nLearning The Facts\n\nExperts estimate that one in four girls and one in six boys are sexually abused before their eighteenth birthday.\n\nThe average age for reported sexual abuse is nine years old.\n\nTwenty-two percent of victims are under the age of eight, and Only one in ten child victims report the abuse.\n\nChildren who are sexually abused and do not âtellâ are at a far greater risk than the general population for a host of psychological, emotional, social, and physical problems, often lasting into adulthood.\n\nMinimize opportunity for abuse by eliminating one-adult/one-child situations. Talk about it. Understand why children often keep abuse a secret. Stay alert to signs of possible sexual abuse.\n\nReducing The Risk\n\nHere are some simple ideas your church can implement to help reduce the risk of sexual abuse in your congregation:\n\nEstablish screening procedures for all volunteers.\n\nRun background checks on employees and volunteers.\n\nInstitute a minimum six-month waiting period for volunteers.\n\nProvide periodic and continuous training for staff and volunteers.\n\nMaintain proper student/teacher ratios.\n\nBe sure all rooms where children and youth meet have windows in the doors.\n\nEliminate one child-one adult interaction at all children/youth.\n\nProvide counseling only in rooms where the door has a window or the door can be kept open at all times.\n\nNever counsel or meet one-on-one at someoneâs home.\n\nCongregation Safety is Your Top Priority\n\nPeople come to your church seeking refuge and peace. They want a safe place to worship, reflect, and connect. Sadly, churches and religious organizations are increasingly the targets of violent attacks. Church security is something every congregation needs to discuss.\n\nLeaders in the church are rarely security experts. You may not know how to begin church security planning. We're here to offer guidance as you take steps to keep your congregation safe.\n\nOur goal is to provide the information to prepare your church in case of a security emergency. This is not an exhaustive list, but it is a great place for you to start.\n\nEstablishing a Church Security Plan\n\nPreparation starts with proper planning. Southern Mutual Church Insurance Company has worked with law enforcement and security consultants to provide great resources for you. Start by checking out our sample Church Security Policies & Procedures Manual.\n\nThis guide includes forming a church security team, a checklist of actions your church can take, firearm policy guidance, and emergency planning procedures.\n\nTake a few minutes and watch the video below. Our insurance experts, along with security consultants, discuss what you can do to improve church security and establish a church security plan.\n\nEach church is unique. The measures you take to protect your place of worship should be thoughtfully and prayerfully considered. Leadership needs to be involved in the development of a church security plan.\n\nAdditional Resources for Church Security\n\nThere is a lot of information available on church security. It can be overwhelming. Weâve put together a few resources for you to begin your research.\n\nThe Protector's Toolkit is a great church safety and security company that includes free resources, as well as a paid membership to help you take your church safety response to the next level. Their website includes a free Church Safety and Security Risk Assessment, which is a great place to start with helping assist you in measuring your church's present level of vulnerability.\n\nStrategos International maintains a blog discussing security. Their article titled The 10 Commandments of Church Security is a great starting point for thinking about security and serves as a reminder that there are many other emergencies beyond active shooters. Strategos International stresses the importance of effective church security training.\n\nFor more information on church security, training, and equipment, check out the resources below or Click Here to email us your questions about Church Security.\n\nSecurity Consulting/Training\n\nProtector's Toolkit\n\nCHRISTIAN SAFETY & SECURITY MADE SIMPLE--The world is sometimes a scary and chaotic place; we help you reduce risk, increase security, and empower your staff so you can provide a safer environment.

Refuge trainers have real-world experience applying the MARCH-E algorithm to save lives and have more than thirty years of experience.\n\nTactical Medical Solutions\n\nYears ago, the term first responder only applied to law enforcement officers, fire rescue personnel, and emergency medical professionals. Recent events have shown us that the term first responder also includes bystanders, involved participants, and concerned citizens who happen to be present. Here at TacMedâ¢ Solutions, we understand that being an untrained provider doesn't diminish the first responder's willingness to help those in need. TacMedâ¢ brings proven life-saving medical gear and instructions together so that anyone can become a first responder.

It provides the student with critical, need-to-know information, which can be utilized in a myriad of situations and stresses the âyou donât know what you donât knowâ principle as well as our own principle of âSimplicity Under Stressâ."
