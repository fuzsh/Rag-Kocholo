The WSU brand consists of the feelings, memories, and expectations that come to mind when people hear or read the word “Washington State University”. We want our audiences to associate those words with a mental picture of a dynamic, engaged and forward-looking organization dedicated to making the world a better place.“(Washington State University – WSU Brand Guidelines).\n\nThe same is true for all of the programs offered by WSU and is particularly true for the flagship WSU Master Gardener program. Branding links the Master Gardener program to WSU, creates a consistent impression across the entire organization, enhances credibility and validity of information, helps guide random or rogue directions and makes every contributor responsible for building a shared reputation.\n\nOfficial Logos\n\nOfficial logos must be used on all official communication from the WSU Master Gardener program, centrally and from county offices. No other representations may be used for the organization or its units. Examples of official communication include:\n\n· Letters\n\n· Brochures\n\n· Posters\n\n· Flyers\n\n· Correspondence\n\n· Table Cloths\n\nSpirit Marks\n\nSpirit marks may be used in conjunction with official logos on official communications. They cannot be used as stand-alone elements on official communications. However, they can be used for as stand-alone elements on apparel such as hats, shirts and other unofficial SWAG to show a relationship to the official WSU Master Gardener program and convey individual credibility.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nUsing logos and spirit marks in a PDF file.\n\nProgram logos, spirit marks, and other identifiers can only be developed by CAHNRS Communications. No other signatures, marks, logos, spirit marks, or representations may be used to represent the organization or its units and divisions without the express written consent from the Associate Dean and Director of Extension.\n\nCounty specific program and foundation logos and spirit marks may be ordered by contacting Gerald Steffen at gsteffen@wsu.edu.\n\nDisclaimers must be used on all flyers, posters, and promotional materials.\n\nWSU Extension programs and employment are available to all without discrimination. Evidence of noncompliance may be reported through your local Extension office.\n\nWSU Extension programs and policies are consistent with federal and state laws and regulations on nondiscrimination regarding race, sex, religion, age, color, creed, national or ethnic origin; physical, mental or sensory disability; marital status, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era or disabled veteran. Evidence of noncompliance may be reported through your local WSU Extension office.\n\nReasonable accommodation will be made for persons with disabilities and special needs who contact (name of contact) at (address, telephone, email) at least (set a specific number of days, weeks) prior to the event.\n\nAccess at WSU | Washington State University\n\nThe Brand Guidelines Training video is approved for 1 hour CE credit.\n\nUse your county logo with the EMG spirit mark for publications.\n\nWSU Extension County Logos (wsu.edu)\n\nSpirit marks may be used in conjunction with official logos on official communications. They cannot be used as stand-alone elements on official communications. However, they can be used as stand-alone elements on apparel such as hats, shirts and other unofficial SWAG to show a relationship to the official WSU Master Gardener program and convey individual credibility.\n\nFind the appropriate spirit mark or icon from the listings below.\n\nClick the image to open, then print or save the image as needed.\n\nFollow all appropriate WSU guidelines for use.\n\nDownload MG flower 67K\n\nDownload MG flower 304K\n\nDownload MG flower 924K\n\nDownload BW MG flower 52KB\n\nDownload BW MG flower 286 KB\n\nDownload BW MG flower 1MB\n\nThe volunteer spirit mark is only to be used for personal items for Extension Master Gardener volunteers on items such as t-shirts and mugs.\n\nDownload volunteer icon 227KB\n\nDownload volunteer icon 422KB\n\nDownload volunteer icon 2MB\n\nDownload local food icon\n\nDownload pollinators icon\n\nDownload wildfire icon\n\nDownload water conservation icon\n\nDownload clean water icon\n\nDownload climate change icon\n\nDownload nearby nature icon\n\nDownload biodiversity icon\n\nDownload soil health icon\n\nDownload zip file containing all Priorities icons.\n\nWSU Extension Master Gardener letterhead (MS Word doc)\n\n3×4 cards in Canva (External website)\n\nPlant sale bookmark template in Canva (External website) customize with your own photo, county logo, and informationPlant sale bookmark sample in English and Spanish\n\nPlant clinic/Event bookmark template in Canva (External website) Plant clinic/event samples: plant clinic 1, plant clinic 2, events sample\n\nPlant Clinic banner 33×77 (pdf) *\n\nNine Program Priorities banner 33×77 (pdf)*\n\nClimate change, water banner 33×77 (pdf)*\n\nSoil, pollinators, local food banner 33×77 (pdf)*\n\nPlants, nature, wildfire banner 33×77 (pdf)*\n\n*The total banner size is 33″x81″, with the final graphic displayed 33″x77″.

We thank you for your continued patience as we work together to ensure we have an effective policy. There are two essential changes.\n\nWSU Extension has approved alternative platforms for background screens to meet the WSU Extension requirements.\n\nAdditionally, effective May 5, 2021, rescreening of volunteer background checks will be required every three years.\n\nThe following options are now available for volunteer background checks:\n\nSterling Volunteers: This is the preferred method and is the only option available to 4-H volunteers who want the 4-H Program to pay for the background check. For all other volunteer programs, including Master Gardeners:\n\nProgram Paid Background Screens: Sterling Volunteers is the only option available for volunteers who want the respective program to pay for the background check. (program paid screening is not available in all counties).\n\nFoundation Paid Background Screens: Individual Foundations will need to determine any limits on amount paid and may use the alternative methods described below if they choose.\n\nWSU will continue to bill Foundations for background screens completed through Sterling Volunteers.\n\nWSU cannot bill Foundations for alternative background check methods.\n\nWSU Extension will accept a Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) fingerprint background check. The FBI labels this as an Identity History Summary Check. Options for accessing a FBI Identity History Summary Check can be found at Identity History Summary Checks — FBI. An Identity History Summary Check will only be accepted with the following provisions:\n\nThe volunteer is responsible for paying for the fingerprint check.\n\nThe FBI fingerprint check must be a full criminal background check (Identity History Summary Check).\n\nThe report produced by the FBI Identity History Summary Check must be delivered directly to: Jana Ferris, WSU Extension Volunteer Specialist, PO Box 370, Marysville, WA 98270 or ferrisj@wsu.edu.\n\nA volunteer may use an alternative background screening platform if they are able to have the screening report submitted directly to the Volunteer Specialist or WSU Extension personnel. As of May 5, 2021, IntelliCorp has been approved as an alternate vendor. Prior to using an alternative platform, including IntelliCorp, please contact the Extension Volunteer Specialist for specific requirements.\n\nCivil Rights, Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct.\n\nDiscrimination in all its forms, including discriminatory harassment, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct (including sexual assault and other sexual violence), destroys mutual respect and a trusting environment, can bring substantial personal harm to individuals, and violates individual rights. Such behaviors are prohibited and are not tolerated at Washington State University. This policy expresses WSU’s commitment to maintain an environment free of all forms of discrimination.\n\nThere will be no discrimination on the basis of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, families with children, sex, marital status, sexual orientation (including gender identity), age, genetic history, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability, in compliance with (a) Presidential Executive Order 11246, as amended, including the Equal Opportunity Clause contained therein; (b) Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974, as amended, and the Affirmative Action Clauses contained therein; (c) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; and (d) applicable nondiscrimination laws of the state of Washington.\n\nConcerns and evidence of discrimination in all its forms may be reported to the local WSU Extension office. To do so, the complaint should be addressed to the county director. Upon receipt of a complaint, the county director shall act promptly to mediate, conciliate, or otherwise achieve informal resolution.\n\nWSU Extension will take specific action to reach out in positive ways to persons who are underrepresented in Extension programs and activities, and to increase diversity in employment. This policy will be demonstrated to persons and implemented in communities through all reasonable efforts.\n\nWSU Extension will not participate in any public meeting, nor provide services, nor use facilities of organizations in which persons are excluded because of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.\n\nNondiscrimination Communication Statements\n\nThe WSU nondiscrimination policy will be communicated to the public through all appropriate WSU Extension public information channels, in mediums that reach persons hearing or sight-impaired, when necessary to ensure total understanding.\n\nAll WSU Extension material must include the nondiscrimination statement. This statement must be included on all printed and web-based material. Use the following statement to meet public notification efforts:\n\nWSU Extension programs and employment are available to all without discrimination. Evidence of noncompliance may be reported through your local WSU Extension Office.\n\nFor long term publications such as Extension bulletins and newsletters where space is not extremely limited use:\n\nWSU Extension programs and policies are consistent with federal and state laws and regulations on nondiscrimination regarding race, sex, religion, age, color, creed, national or ethnic origin, physical, mental or sensory disability, marital status, sexual orientation or status as a Vietnam-era or disabled veteran. Evidence of noncompliance may be reported through your local WSU Extension office.\n\nWhere space is limited or materials are used on a short-term basis, such as letters and news releases, or as a signature line on emails, use:\n\nExtension programs and employment are available to all without discrimination. Evidence of noncompliance may be reported through your local Extension office.\n\nThe nondiscrimination poster “And Justice for All” must be prominently displayed in all offices permanently used by WSU Extension in serving the public. The poster must also be displayed at all venues used by WSU Extension employees and volunteers.\n\nServing All Audiences\n\nWSU Extension, as a land-grant institution, shall seek to serve the needs of all audiences. Balanced participation, or parity, occurs when the ethnicity, race, gender, age, religion, and economic characteristics of participants across our portfolio of programs are representative of the county population. A successful Extension program has balanced participation. Documentation of gender and ethnic groups participating in Extension programs is required. Documentation shall include demographics information of the participants attending WSU Extension Master Gardener programs and WSU Extension Master Gardener program volunteers. These data portray how balanced Master Gardener program participation is. Tools for collecting demographic information can be found on the WSU Master Gardener Program website.\n\nReasonable Accommodation\n\nAll WSU Extension sponsored events, including those cosponsored with a Master Gardener Foundation, must be accessible in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (section 504). All WSU units and event organizers should be familiar with and conform events to these guidelines.\n\nAll WSU Extension Master Gardener materials publicizing public or volunteer events, including any event that is cosponsored with a Master Gardener Foundation, must include the following reasonable accommodation language.\n\nPersons with disabilities who require alternative means for communication or program information, or reasonable accommodations need to contact (name of contact) at (address, telephone, email) at least (set a specific number of days, weeks) prior to the event.\n\nOr\n\nReasonable accommodations will be made for persons with disabilities and special needs who contact (name of contact) at (address, telephone, email) at least (set a specific number of days, weeks) prior to the event.\n\nSeparation of Church and State\n\nThe first amendment of the United States Constitution requires governmental neutrality with regard to religion. Government is restricted to secular purposes and must neither advance nor inhibit religion. Further, Washington State law mandates that all institutions supported by state funds be free of sectarian control or influence.\n\nWSU Extension and its programs are obligated to uphold this principle. Extension events may be held in sectarian facilities provided attendance is open to persons of all beliefs.\n\nRecord Keeping\n\nRecords must be maintained for a variety of purposes related to civil rights compliance. Work with the county director in your office to ensure compliance. A County Civil Rights Checklist and Filing Guide indicate the type of documents county offices must keep. Tools to collect volunteer and clientele demographic information can be found on the WSU Master Gardener Program website. An office filing cabinet will be designated as the civil rights file. Electronic records are also acceptable.\n\nMore information on civil rights and affirmative action can be found on the WSU Extension website: “Extension is for Everyone.”\n\nContinuing Education/Advanced Education.\n\nVolunteers must earn at least ten hours of continuing education per year to be considered for reapplication. County coordinators have the option of allowing up to ten hours of excess CE to be carried over to meet the following year’s CE requirement, but CE must be reported when earned. Program coordinators must preapprove continuing education and may limit certain categories of continuing education. Continuing education does not count toward a volunteer’s internship; nor does it count toward the annual service hour requirement. The purpose of continuing education is to improve volunteers’ knowledge and skill base for performing work as community educators in horticulture and environmental stewardship.\n\nWhat Qualifies for Continuing Education?\n\nHorticultural courses given by WSU, including retaking basic Master Gardener training.\n\nWebinars, field trips, and workshops sponsored by Extension.\n\nClasses offered by accredited institutions, including community colleges, technical colleges, and universities.\n\nWashington State Department of Agriculture approved pesticide classes.\n\nClasses taught by professional associations such as Washington State Nursery and Landscape Association, Washington Association of Landscape Professionals, International Society of Arboriculture, etc.\n\nTime spent doing research preparing a Master Gardeners presentation which is then delivered to the community (limit of four times the length of the presentation).\n\nTime spent doing research for a newspaper or Master Gardener newsletter article which is then published (limit of four hours).\n\nOther activities, including training on how programs are planned, delivered, or evaluated; presentation skills; meeting facilitation; etc. may qualify. Contact your program coordinator for preapproval before listing them on your report.\n\nWhat Does Not Qualify for Continuing Education?\n\nTrips and tours not preapproved by the program coordinator\n\nGarden craft or photography classes\n\nPersonal research or reading not related to a Master Gardener project\n\nTravel time to and from events\n\nAnything outside the State of Washington, unless preapproved by the State Master Gardener Program Leader\n\nCode of Conduct.\n\nAs a WSU Extension Master Gardener, volunteers will:\n\nRepresent WSU Extension with dignity and pride.\n\nRespect all persons with whom they interact as a WSU Extension Master Gardener (fellow volunteers, Extension and other county personnel, and the general public).\n\nConduct themselves in a courteous, respectful manner and refrain from profanity, harassment, disruptive behavior, or abuse of any kind.\n\nProvide a positive role model when working with youth.\n\nRespect and follow WSU, county, and program policies and guidelines.\n\nComply with equal employment opportunity and nondiscrimination laws.\n\nNot consume alcohol, use marijuana, tobacco (including vapor products), or illegal substances while representing WSU Extension.\n\nParticipate as team members within the WSU Extension Master Gardener Program.\n\nWSU Master Gardener volunteers are representatives of WSU Extension and should dress in an appropriate and professional manner. This includes always wearing one’s name badge when serving as a WSU volunteer.\n\nClothes should be suitable for the activity or location. Office-casual is appropriate for speaking engagements, indoor plant clinics, and schools. Gardening work clothes are appropriate for demonstration gardens and some outdoor events.\n\nWorkers Compensation Coverage for Injury.\n\nVolunteers currently enrolled in the WSU Extension Master Gardener Program, while acting in good faith within the scope of their official WSU duties, are covered under the WSU workers’ compensation coverage through the Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) for injuries/illness resulting from their volunteer activities pursuant to RCW 51.36. Timely entry of volunteer hours into the volunteer database is imperative. L&I coverage may include hospital, physician’s care, prescriptions, ambulance, and other associated costs. Loss of income is not covered.\n\nWhen a workplace accident occurs among WSU employees, volunteers, or visitors, supervisors are responsible for reporting, evaluating, and, when necessary, investigating the incident. Reporting and investigating all accidents is required by state regulations and is an integral part of WSU’s accident prevention program. Investigations are conducted to identify factors contributing to the accident and methods for correcting and eliminating these contributing factors.\n\nReport all workplace injuries to your supervisor immediately, and seek medical treatment if needed. Timing is everything: WSU policy requires that all (major and minor) injuries be reported within twenty-four hours. Prompt reporting eliminates delays in benefits to individuals. For injuries that occur over the weekend or after regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm), reports should be submitted the next regular business day after the accident. Major incidents resulting in serious injury (e.g., fracture or amputation), inpatient hospitalization, or death are to be reported immediately.\n\nIn the event of an accident, the supervisor completes:\n\nThe WSU Online Incident Report.\n\nAnd If…\n\nThe volunteer receives medical treatment; or\n\nThe volunteer is unable to work the next full or subsequent shift(s) as a result of the injury or illness; or\n\nEvents and conditions involving a near miss or minor accident indicate that most likely injury or illness would have been serious.\n\nThe supervisor completes the Supervisor’s Accident Investigation Report.\n\nWhen visiting a healthcare provider, be sure to indicate you were injured on the job and thus this could be a workers’ compensation claim.\n\nThe most up-to-date information on completing an injury/illness report can be found on the WSU Master Gardener Program website.\n\nCommunity Gardens\n\nCommunity Gardens are spaces where community members can rent a plot to grow crops for personal use or for donation to food banks or other community food program. WSU Master Gardeners may teach, demonstrate, support development, or administer a new or existing community garden. Maintenance of community gardens when no educational component is involved may not be counted as volunteer hours for WSU Master Gardener certification or recertification. WSU Master Gardeners may maintain a minimal bed to use for demonstration of sustainable gardening techniques or practices. Any produce from this bed will be distributed according to the rules developed for the garden. WSU Master Gardeners may not maintain any communal or individual plots. Any physical labor performed is done so as a private citizen, and WSU’s liability insurance will not apply.\n\nAll participants in community garden efforts must recognize that WSU Extension Master Gardener volunteers are educators and advocates for sustainable gardening in their communities. In this spirit, WSU Master Gardener volunteers may assist community partners by:\n\nLeading community partners through a step-by-step process to develop a community garden;\n\nHelping to assess the suitability of a property for a community garden;\n\nHelping to design the garden, including layout of beds and common areas;\n\nProviding assistance in acquiring funding and grants, including in-kind donations based on the value of volunteer hours;\n\nArranging for or leading workshops and seminars in the garden; and\n\nGiving one-on-one or small group instruction on activities such as preparing soil, planting, cultivation, harvest, pest management, etc.\n\nUse of Copyrighted Material\n\nText, tables, illustrations, photos, graphics, video, and audio segments from the works of others, regardless of the source except for federal entities, are protected by copyright and may not be reproduced by employees, including volunteers, of Washington State University Extension without explicit written permission from the copyright owner or entity. Production of materials that contain copyrighted materials, except for brief sections of text treated as a quotation, must have written permission to protect Washington State University against copyright infringement claims.\n\nIdeas or information from other sources may be used without obtaining permission, provided that the information is expressed in your own words and images (graphics, tables, charts, photos, etc.). When you use information previously produced by others, professional and moral ethics dictate that you give credit by citing the original source.\n\nQuestions about copyright should be directed to your local program coordinator, county faculty, or statewide program leader. More information can be found on the program website.\n\nDemographic collection form (.pdf)\n\nPest Management Agreement (.pdf)\n\nLiability waiver for non-volunteers (.pdf)\n\nAdditional resources for EMG Program coordinators\n\nTop\n\nPlant and Insect Diagnostic Clinic Resources\n\nKeep It Local\n\nInclude regional keywords such as ‘Washington’ or ‘Pacific Northwest’ in your search. Other parts of the country have different soils, weather, and pests. Gardening recommendations from other areas may not be appropriate for the Pacific Northwest. Even the same pests behave and are managed differently in different climates. If possible, limit gardening research to the PNW (Washington, Oregon, and Idaho). That being said, there are many useful extension publications and websites from other regions, especially for more general gardening topics. These sources can be used; just keep in mind that our local climate and soil may produce different results.\n\nKeep It Science-based\n\nLimit your search to university websites (‘.edu’ domain names) by typing ‘site:.edu’ into the search field after your keywords.\n\nAs Master Gardener volunteers, you are representing WSU. Information in articles and presentations must be science-based. This is especially important for pest management. Also try ‘site:.gov’ to search only government websites. To search non-profit organizations, use ‘site:.org’ but keep in mind that some organizations present biased information that is not science-based. Ask your program coordinator, if you are unsure whether a reference is science-based. Download the Approved References for Pest Management document.\n\nKeep It Focused\n\nTry multiple keyword combinations. Putting quotation marks around multiple words will search for that exact sequence of words. Additional keywords are often listed under the detailed record listing and are especially useful in narrowing your search efforts.\n\nIt is easy to become sidetracked by the sheer volume of information available online. By focusing your keyword search, you will be able to research much faster.\n\nGo to the Local Library\n\nLibrarians are trained to help access both online and print materials. You can access the WSU library catalog through interlibrary loan (WSU Libraries | Washington State University) with your local public library account. WSU library will send hard copies of books and electronic copies of book chapters or magazine articles through interlibrary loan.\n\nBooks and other printed material are a great resource. Most books have been subjected to more rigorous factchecking than online information. However, books can be outdated and inappropriate for our region. Keep in mind the publication date and author’s location.\n\nKeep a List of Sources\n\nAs you collect information, keep a list of sources. Provide these sources at the end of the article or PowerPoint presentation. Although this list may not be included in the print version of a newspaper article, it is important for checking facts and fielding questions.\n\nThis document created by S.

Policy applicable to WSU Extension Master Gardeners (“Master Gardeners”), including Pest Management Recommendations is included in the Master Gardener Program Handbook (2020). The relevant passage from page 14 of the handbook is included below:\n\n“When asked for pest management recommendations, WSU Extension Master Gardeners are required to provide an integrated pest management approach which includes information about cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods. Pesticide recommendations must be made from home and garden sections of relevant current WSU publications or other WSU-approved materials. Only certified WSU Master Gardener volunteers are permitted to provide pesticide recommendations and may only do so in accordance with the WSU Extension Master Gardener Volunteer Pest Management Recommendations Agreement. WSU Master Gardener interns shall work in mentorship with a certified WSU Master Gardener or qualified faculty or staff to learn how to make pesticide recommendations.\n\nWSU will provide defense and indemnification for WSU Master Gardener volunteer pest management recommendations only if all WSU policies and procedures are followed. Compliance with policies is essential for WSU liability coverage.”\n\nApproved References:\n\nThe following references provide chemical and non-chemical pest management recommendations. Hortsense and Pestsense are focused on home gardeners. The PNW resources serve a broader audience, so Master Gardeners must ensure any pesticide recommendations they make using these resources include only those pesticides available to home gardeners. The PNW handbooks are available online. Outdated print copies must be removed from your plant clinics. Master Gardeners should advise clients to read and follow all label directions.\n\nWSU Hortsense Website was designed to “provide the user with integrated pest management strategies for the most common yard and garden plant problems occurring in the Pacific Northwest“. This is an excellent resource with which to start, moving on to PNW handbooks if the plant or pest is not listed.\n\nWSU Pestsense Website was designed to “provide the user with integrated pest management strategies for the most common indoor pest problems occurring in the Pacific Northwest.” This is a good resource for houseplant pests.\n\nPlant Disease Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org) “This handbook is intended as a ready reference guide to the control and management tactics for the more important plant diseases in the Pacific Northwest. … Master gardeners and homeowners may find this publication useful. However, many of the compounds listed under chemical control are available only to licensed applicators. Compounds generally recognized as safe can easily be obtained at local garden centers and supply stores. Some of these materials in the “Host and Disease Descriptions” section of this book are represented by the symbol H. This symbol simply indicates that the same product or a similar product with the same active ingredient is commonly available in home packaging.” Plant Disease Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org).\n\nInsect Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org) “This handbook is intended as a tool for making decisions regarding the control and management of important insect pests in the Pacific Northwest. Originally, it was written for commercial growers, county extension agents, consultants, field and nursery staff, and chemical industry representatives. In recent years we have added sections that are useful to Master Gardeners and homeowners.”\n\nWeed Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org) “This handbook is designed as a quick and ready reference for weed control practices and herbicides used in various cropping systems or sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.” The Home Garden and Landscape Management section of this handbook may be of some use to Master Gardeners, including a listing of herbicides available to home gardeners.\n\nWSU Gardening Publications Website with over 100 WSU publications relevant to home gardening, most available as free downloads. Few of these include pesticide recommendations, but relevant cultural control methods are covered where applicable.\n\nWSU Gardening in Washington State Home gardening publications available at the WSU publications website are also available here, grouped by gardening topic.\n\nPest Leaflet Series (PLS) WSU Puyallup Plant & Insect Diagnostic Laboratory brief “bulletins” on problems received at the laboratory, for which no formal extension bulletins or other readily available information exists.\n\nGrow Smart Grow Safe Sponsored by Thurston County, provides home gardener information resources including pesticide product hazard ratings, Integrated Pest Management, pesticide alternatives.\n\nPICOL The WSU Pesticide Information Center OnLine database may be of use to Master Gardeners who want to view pesticide labels based on searches by pest, active ingredient, or product name.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nMany of the reference books and resources in use at Master Gardener plant clinics throughout the state include pest management advice. These include publications by reliable authorities including university extensions in other states. These references are appropriate to cite if:\n\nChemical control advice is based only upon that contained in the ten (10) Approved References listed above.\n\nCultural controls advice is science and research-based, current, and relevant to gardening in Washington state.\n\nFor clients with questions about insect and plant identification or plant problem diagnosis that Master Gardeners cannot answer either because they are not permitted to (e.g., commercial, municipal) or because they have exhausted local Extension resources, the client should be referred to the WSU Plant & Insect Diagnostic Laboratories in Pullman (Plant Pest Diagnostic Clinic | Washington State University (wsu.edu))or Puyallup (Plant Clinic Site | Washington State University (wsu.edu)).\n\nThis information was updated in January 2022 by a team that included:\n\nJennifer Marquis, WSU Extension Master Gardener Program Leader\n\nJim Kropf, WSU Extension Northwest District Director, Interim Pierce County Director\n\nTim Kohlhauff, WSU Extension Coordinator, Urban Horticulture, Spokane County\n\nClaire Cotnoir, Master Gardener, Skagit County\n\nDon Enstrom, Master Gardener, Lewis County\n\nCarrie Hill, Master Gardener, King County\n\nWe welcome your feedback and improvement suggestions via email.\n\nOnly the online versions (below) may be used.\n\nPlease discard all printed copies.\n\nInsect Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org)\n\nPlant Disease Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org)\n\nWeed Management Handbook | Pacific Northwest Pest Management Handbooks (pnwhandbooks.org)\n\nPlant Clinic and Community Outreach Form (fillable .pdf) for use at farmers’ markets and other community events.\n\nPlant Problem Diagnostic Form example from Chelan County (.pdf)\n\nTurf Grass Diagnostic Form example from Chelan County (.pdf)\n\nInsect ID Diagnostic Form example from Chelan County (.pdf)\n\nPlant Problem Worksheet (.pdf)\n\nDemographic collection form (.pdf)\n\nPest Management Agreement (.pdf)\n\nLiability waiver for non-volunteers (.pdf)\n\nCommercial print-ready (with bleed allowance) for business card to give clinic clients to Gardening Resources including Hortsense and Gardening in Washington State.\n\nDownload 2×3 file\n\nTop"
