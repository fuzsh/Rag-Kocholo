        "text": "Below is a list of consumer reporting companies – companies that collect information and provide reports on consumers that are used to decide whether to provide consumers credit, insurance, or employment, and for other purposes. There are a lot of \"specialty reporting companies\" that focus on certain industries.\n\nThis list doesn’t cover every company in the industry. It’s a list of companies that have identified themselves as consumer reporting companies or provide consumers access to their consumer reports. The list includes both the biggest nationwide credit reporting companies and a longer list of “specialty reporting companies.”\n\nThe list includes information about how you can obtain copies of your reports. In addition to the information below about when you can get a free copy of your report, under federal law all consumer reporting companies must provide you with a copy of your report for a reasonable fee (the current maximum is $11.50). You can recieve credit reports from Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax one a year for free. Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to get your free report.\n\nThis information comes from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (www.consumerfinance.gov)\n\nThis list includes entities that have identified themselves as consumer reporting companies or particular types of consumer reporting companies or have indicated when they provide consumers access to their consumer reports. The list incorporates information from the companies’ own self-descriptions that has not been independently verified by the Bureau. It was not intended by the Bureau to be an all-inclusive list, nor does it reflect any determinations by the Bureau as to whether any particular entity is or is not subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act or any part thereof or complying with it. Furthermore, presence on or absence from the list does not indicate whether the consumer reporting company is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority.\n\nTo see a particular specialty, click on the name or scroll down the page [top]\n\nNational Credit Reporting Companies\n\nCheck Screening/Check History\n\nPayday Lending\n\nAuto and Property Insurance History Reports\n\nSupplementary/Alternative Credit Reports\n\nUtilities\n\nRental\n\nMedical\n\nEmployment History Reports\n\nNATIONAL CREDIT REPORTING COMPANIES\n\nEquifax\n\nEquifax is one of the largest nationwide providers of credit reports.
