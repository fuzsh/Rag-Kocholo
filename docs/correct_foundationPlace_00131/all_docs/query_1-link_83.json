        "text": "Why do so many wanna-be entrepreneurs like Scott Rozic, founder and CEO of XMarkstheSpot, head for Silicon Valley? The reason may seem as obvious as why Willie Sutton robbed banks—because that's where the money is. But it's really more complicated than that.\n\nBiologist Garrett Hardin coined the phrase \"tragedy of the commons\" to describe a system in which people acting rationally and in their own self-interest destroy the very resources they all share for their livelihood. His original example was of colonial farmers. Adding sheep to a flock grazing on the town commons made sense for the individual but eventually brought ruin to all. The culture of Silicon Valley turns that system on its head. The bank of expertise in Silicon Valley represents a triumph of the commons: resources are extracted and replenished in a self-regulating and efficient manner that promotes cooperation and growth. That triumph can be attributed to the Valley's distinctive geography, history, and culture.\n\nWhy The Triumph\n\nViewing the valley from the flight approach to San Francisco International, one is struck by how small the region is. As Venture Law Group's Craig Johnson notes, Silicon Valley \"is like any gas that is compressed; it gets hotter.\" Its tribes overlap socially and professionally based on work discipline (software engineers, for example), organizational affiliation (Hewlett-Packard), or background (Stanford MBAs or South Asian immigrants). The most skillful players do not have to travel far to make deals, change jobs, or find professional partners. John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins is fond of saying that the Valley is a place where you can change your job without changing your parking spot.\n\nShared values also bind longtime Silicon Valley natives. The personal convictions of the Valley's remarkable innovators, who created not just a company but an industry, still echo through the community. Bill Hewlett and David Packard influenced the older generation directly; many of them were early employees. Through this old guard, collegiality and high standards for performance are being carried down to next-generation entrepreneurs.\n\nHelping former employees is part of that legacy and culture. Senior mentor capitalists describe how Bill Hewlett encouraged them when they left HP and how HP engineers encouraged entrepreneurship generally. Former IntelliCorp CEO K. C. Branscomb tries to help people who have worked for her. \"I will call venture capitalists for them. There are probably a half-dozen little companies founded by former employees that I have helped get funded.\" Mike Homer, former general manager of Netscape's Netcenter, expresses a similar sentiment: \"I'm a pretty loyal guy to people I've worked for and who've worked for me. If somebody comes to me and wants this kind of help, I may not be the one to provide it in all cases, but I'm going to figure out how to get them the resources they need.\"\n\nHow The Commons Works\n\nMentor capitalists in the Valley function as an informal, close-knit guild. Today's employee may be tomorrow's boss; today's competitor, tomorrow's partner or acquisition. If you're an experienced, reputable member of the guild, you're entitled to draw from the common fund of expertise. Often, the exchanges aren't direct, one-to-one transactions. Bread cast upon the water returns in another form at another time from other people. \"You can see it coming back to you,\" Johnson explains. \"Like with Grassroots [his own recent start-up], I thought, who could help me on this project? The fact that I can call busy, successful people whom I don't know personally and have them return my calls—I think is a recognition that it's not just me, that it is just the etiquette of the game.\"\n\nOne doesn't become a guild member without credentials. The best-known mentor capitalists started businesses themselves or held senior positions in one of the Valley's garage-to-giant start-ups such as Netscape or Oracle. But having failed once or twice along the way does not disqualify them. In fact, the scars are proof of valor—provided one has at least as many booms as busts on the ledger sheet. Says Kleiner Perkins's Vinod Khosla of a prominent mentor, \"People like him have earned the right to advise entrepreneurs. They are qualified to do it, they've done it right, they've done it wrong, and they know the difference.\" It is understood, therefore, that when you join the guild, you enter as a master craftsman, not as an apprentice.\n\nGuild members depend on one another to prequalify potential entrepreneurs. Every hour that a guild member spends reviewing an investment risk represents a deposit in the bank. \"I could take all the raw data with all the entrepreneurs who approach me and do my own filtering, and so could the venture capitalists. But it's an enormously time-intensive process. We've all learned that we can use each other as filters, and there's an unofficial ranking of filters in the Valley that people constantly have in their minds,\" Johnson says. Foundation Capital's Mike Schuh underscores the value of mentor capitalists as filters: \"Of the hundreds of things that I look at every week, if it's got one of those [mentor's] names on it, I don't even bother reading further. I just make the appointment.\""
