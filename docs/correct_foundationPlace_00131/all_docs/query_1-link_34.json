        "text": "Jamie Constantine (Oshkosh, WI) - 2024-25 Global Grant Scholarship Receipent\n\nRotary International District 6270 is pleased to announce that The Rotary Foundation has named Jamie Constantine a Global Grant Scholarship recipient for 2024-2025, awarding her $30,000 toward a masterâs degree in global development from SOAS University in London.\n\nMs. Constantine is a graduate of Oshkosh West High School in Oshkosh and received her collegiate undergraduate degree from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Although born and raised in the Midwest, she has had unique opportunities to explore the world as a student and global citizen in China, Ecuador, Cuba, and Mexico.\n\nConstantineâs objectives for the Rotary Global Grant Scholarship are to improve the economic well-being of poor, low-income, and underserved communities (particularly immigrant and refugee populations) through pursuing a Master of Science (MSc) in Global Development from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, England. SOAS is ranked #2 in the world for development studies. She will learn from expert staff how to approach the worldâs most pressing issues of poverty and insecurity. During her year-long graduate studies, she will reside at the Goodenough College in London.\n\nThe scholarship is provided with funds from Rotary International District 6270, matched 80% by the World Fund of Rotary International. The World Fund is the primary funding source for global grants which support large international activities with sustainable, measurable outcomes in Rotaryâs areas of focus. By working together to respond to real community needs, Rotary clubs and districts strengthen their global partnerships.\n\nReacting to her award, Ms. Constantine states, âIâm thrilled to be the recipient of District 6270âs Global Grant Scholarship. I look forward to becoming an active participant within Rotary spaces and building community with the Rotary Club of Harrow!â Earlier this month, Emory University in Atlanta released a story regarding Jamie's Rotary International Global Grant Scholarship and Jamie's personal story.\n\nThe Host for this scholarship is the Rotary Club of Harrow in Rotary International District 1130, Rotary in London, United Kingdom. RI District 6270, the International Partner and primary financial provider of the scholarship, is comprised of 55 Rotary clubs and two Rotaract clubs in Southeast Wisconsin with nearly 2,500 members. Rotary is a global network of 1.4 million neighbors, friends, leaders, and problem-solvers who see a world where people unite and take action to create lasting change â across the globe, in our communities, and in ourselves.\n\nSubmitted on May 10, 2024 by Larry Myers (Elmbrook (Brookfield)), Chair of the RI District 6270 Scholarships Subcommittee (scholarshipchair@rotary6270. org).\n\nRotary District 6270's Pivotal Role in Supporting Ukrainian Relief Efforts\n\nRotary District 6270's Pivotal Role in Supporting Ukrainian Relief Efforts\n\nApril 27, 2024 ~ Peter Bosch\n\nThe Rotary Clubs across Southeast Wisconsin, encompassed by Rotary District 6270, have played a significant role in supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine during its time of crisis. This article highlights the impactful work facilitated by these clubs, in partnership with Be an Angel e.V. Germany and Friends of Be an Angel USA (Mequon, Wisconsin).\n\nGenerators for Hope and Survival\n\nIn August 2022, anticipating the severe winter energy crisis due to ongoing conflict, Rotary District 6270 participated in a vital initiative to provide generators to Ukrainian hospitals, refugee centers, and other critical infrastructures. This project, coordinated by Friends of Be an Angel, supplied 1,715 generators, distributing over 8,017 kW of power. These generators are essential in ensuring that life-saving medical and heating equipment can continue to function despite attacks on Ukraineâs energy infrastructure.\n\nAn estimated total of 20,475 people have been directly helped within the first week of this project.\n\nThe beneficiaries of these efforts included over 150 hospitals and clinics, 80 warming stations, and numerous other facilities that cater to vulnerable populations such as orphanages and schools. A particular focus was placed on the Donetsk region, where the need was greatest due to the intensity of the conflict.\n\nBroad Community Impact\n\nThe generosity of Rotary District 6270 extended beyond material donations. The District was integral in forming a network that included the Rotary Club of Lviv-Leopolis, which provided ground support, and the Womenâs Movement for the Future, which managed warehousing and distribution of the aid. This network ensured that the aid reached where it was most needed quickly and efficiently.\n\nGratitude and Recognition\n\nBe an Angel e.V. Germany and Friends of Be an Angel USA have expressed their deep gratitude to all the members of Rotary District 6270 for their unwavering support. Andreas TÃ¶lke and Anya Verkhovskaya, representing these organizations, have personally thanked the District for the contributions that have made a significant difference in the lives of thousands of Ukrainians.\n\nOngoing Commitment\n\nThe impact of Rotary District 6270âs involvement highlights the powerful role that organizations can play in global humanitarian efforts. The District continues to seek opportunities to assist and expand its reach to ensure that even in times of great need, the spirit of community and support shines through. Rotary District 6270 embodies the Rotary Internationalâs commitment to serving humanity and supporting communities in need, both locally and globally. Their efforts in Ukraine are a testament to their dedication to making a positive impact on the world, proving that together, we can bring light during the darkest times.\n\nImage of Statistics credit: Friends of Be an Angel USA website.\n\nFrom PDG Craig Burnett\n\nPDG Catherine Zimmerman Awarded RI Service Above Self Award\n\nRotary International District 6270 is honored to announce that Rotary Internationalâs Service Above Self award has been conferred upon PDG (2003 â 2004) Catherine Zimmerman. The award is bestowed by the Rotary International Board of Directors on no more than 150 recipients worldwide each year, and is Rotaryâs highest individual honor, one based entirely on the recipientâs volunteer service, both to Rotary, and non-Rotary causes.\n\nCathyâs dedication to service has been wide and deep, and covers decades dating to the beginning of her professional career. She later joined the Rotary Club of Oshkosh in June of 1987; just 56 days after the U.S. Supreme Court mandated that women be allowed to join Rotary. She has made the most of every year since then serving Rotary and other worthy causes.\n\nProving as always to be a gracious, effective, and motivational leader, on receiving the award, Cathy said, âI am overwhelmed and so humbled to have received the RI Service Above Self Award. This recognition is possible only because of the fellowship and friendships of so many Rotarians and others, supporting each other, rolling-up their sleeves and working together to accomplish a common mission and vision.â\n\nDistrict 6270 is so very lucky to have had Cathy in our midst for so long. She is truly a role model for what it takes to be a Rotarian, and to be a leader â in any arena of life.\n\nWelcome -\n\nNew Fond du Lac Afterhours Satellite Club\n\nCongratulations to the New Fond du Lac Afterhours Satellite Club\n\nIt is with great pleasure we welcome a new satellite club to District 6270. New clubs make it possible for current, past members, and new members of Rotary to create more opportunity for service in our community and the world. A special thanks to Barb Senn and the board of Fond du Lac Morning for spearheading this effort. It is wonderful to see how Rotary can renew itself and adjust to new times and circumstances. The new club is currently meeting once a month virtually but is looking to change to hybrid meetings in the coming months. With 10 active members, the club is set for growth.\n\nA satellite club offers current members of a club the opportunity to meet a changing schedule or circumstance, past members to rejoin Rotary, and new members to join at a time and place that fits their work hours or family schedule better.\n\nA few comments from club members to illustrate some of the many reason for clubs to offer an alternative to a traditional Rotary experience:\n\nâWe used to be Interact members and wanted to rejoin the Rotary World, but a morning club did not make that possible.â\n\nâWe now spend several months out of state and the time difference makes it difficult to participate in a morning meeting.â\n\nâI am commuting to work at 7:00 AM and an afterhours club makes it possible to join Rotary.â\n\nCongratulations to Fond du Lac Afterhours. Four growing active Satellite Clubs are now part of our District.\n\nDo you have similar circumstance in your Club? It is time to think about a Satellite Club! Letâs talk! Contact Steen Sanderhoff, District 6270 Club Development/Extension Chair for more information.\n\nFrom Holger Knaack, President, Rotary International 2020-21\n\n2021 Rotary Convention Now Virtual\n\nBy now we have sadly grown accustomed to hearing of the need to shift major public events to being held virtually rather than face to face. Unfortunately, the Rotary Board of Directors was compelled to again make the difficult decision to celebrate this yearâs International Convention as a virtual event. While this may not be an unexpected decision, it is still a deeply disappointing one â for us and for our friends in Taiwan who have been planning an exceptional event. I want to thank the Host Committee for the admirable job they did building support for what surely would have been one of Rotaryâs finest events.\n\nWe had hoped that a combination of vaccine uptake and public health measures would have brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control. We all know that in many parts of the world the pandemic is still raging and we must maintain our vigilance and patience before resuming major public gatherings. Taiwan has done an admirable job managing the pandemic â and local Rotarians were still eager to host and celebrate with us. Under the guidance of the World Health Organization and the local public health organization in Taiwan, it became clear that an event of this scale would be impossible to host safely.\n\nWhile we are disappointed that we could not have a traditional convention, we are excited about the virtual event being planned for all Rotarians worldwide. Last yearâs convention attracted significant viewership during its weeklong program. This year, we will channel all we have learned about staging the very best in virtual events into a program that promises to open new opportunities for you to be entertained, enlightened and energized. We will share more details about the 2021 Virtual Convention soon.\n\nConvention, pre-convention, and ticket refunds\n\nWe will automatically cancel and refund all existing registrations. This includes purchases made for the Rotaract and Youth Exchange and the Intercountry Committees preconvention events, and ticketed meal events. We kindly ask that you do not contact RI Registration to inquire about your registration, ticket, or housing cancellations as we work diligently to inform all attendees and process cancellations and refunds. For those who had already canceled prior to today, you will also receive a refund of the $50 processing fee.\n\nHost Organization Committee (HOC) ticketed event registrations\n\nThe HOC event ticket fees will be refunded by the Taipei HOC. For more information, please visit rotarytaipei2021.org.\n\nHotel rooms\n\nIf you have secured accommodations within Rotaryâs official housing block, no action will be required on your end. Maritz, Rotaryâs official housing partner, will contact you with the details of your cancelation.\n\nIf you have secured a group room block and made a full or partial payment, you will receive a follow-up communication and instructions on receiving a refund.\n\nI want to thank all Rotarians and Rotaractors around the world for your understanding and your continued willingness to learn and adapt. We are becoming a stronger, more nimble organization because of this, and our Virtual Convention will be a reflection of this new Rotary.\n\nPlease be safe and take care of each other.\n\nInvitation from Foundation Chair Mary Beth Seiser\n\nSpecial District 6270 Event: Our Foundation - Opportunities within Challenging Times\n\nAll District 6270 Rotarians, Rotaractors, and their spouses/significant others/friends are invited to join us for an inspiring evening celebrating The Rotary Foundation.\n\nWhen: Thursday, November 12, 2020, 6:15 - 7:45 PM (CST) (Please note adjustment to meeting times to accommodate our speaker's schedule)\n\nWhere: Virtual, Connect with Zoom\n\nKeynote Speaker: Barry Rassin, Past President of Rotary International\n\nA member of the Rotary Club of East Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas, Rassin has been described as one who strikes a perfect balance between Bahamian bonhomie and decisive leadership. He earned an MBA in health and hospital administration from the University of Florida and is the first fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives in the Bahamas. He retired after 37 years as president of Doctors Hospital Health System and is a lifetime member of the American Hospital Association. A Rotarian since 1980, Rassin has served as a director, a training leader, and the aide to 2015-2016 RI President K R Ravindran. Rassin received Rotaryâs highest honor, the Service Above Self Award, as well as other humanitarian awards for his work leading Rotaryâs relief efforts in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. He served as Rotary International President in 2018-19, and currently is leading the HANWASH (Haiti National Clean Water, Sanitation and Health Strategy) project in Haiti. He and his wife, Esther, who he credits with keeping him grounded, are Major Donors and Benefactors of the Rotary Foundation. His mantra, âYouâve got to take risks in this life. Thatâs what weâre here to do: not to follow the same old path, but to take out your machete, cut away the bush, and create a new way.â\n\nRegister in advance to receive your login information: Foundation Zoom Registration\n\nGlobal Grant Scholarship Opportunity\n\nGlobal Grant Scholarship Opportunity\n\nRI District 6270 is pleased to announce that a Global Grant Scholarship in the amount of U.S. $30,000 is being offered for matriculation in the Fall 2021 or Spring 2022. The program of studies must be a graduate level program overseas, not in the United States, and must align closely with one of RIâs current six Areas of Focus. The 7th Area of Focus, âSupporting the Environment,â will not come on-line until July 1, 2021.\n\nApplicants must hold at least an undergraduate degree or anticipate graduation within the current year.

Current Rotarians (Rotaractors are eligible to receive GG Scholarships.)\n\n2. Employees of clubs, districts, other Rotary entities (as defined in section 1.040. of the Rotary Code of Policies) and of Rotary International\n\n3. Rotarian spouses; children or grandchildren by blood, legal adoption, or marriage without adoption; the spouses of those children or grandchildren, or parents or grandparents by blood of people listed above; and employees of agencies, organizations, or institutions that work with Rotary International or the Foundation.\n\nIf you have ever wondered about the impact of the Global Grant Scholarship program, consider the following comments from Dr. Jason Gehrke, our District 6270 GG Scholar during 2016-2017, who did his Ph.D. dissertation research at the University of Strassbourg, France, in the \"Peace and Conflict Resolution\" Area of Focus:\n\nâThank you for your goodwill to me and to all our fellow citizens. It has been too long since our last communication. After my year as a Rotary GG Scholar in France, we moved to Valparaiso, Indiana, where I put my studies in France to good use in teaching. At Valparaiso University I developed a course on the just war tradition, which incorporated much of what I had learned while taking courses in Strasbourg, especially when we get to the modern section of European policy. This year, I accepted a new role as Assistant Professor of History at Hillsdale College, MI, where my teaching will focus on the intersection of history, politics, and international relations. I think that Hillsdale will be our permanent home. And I know that the Rotary Global Grant Scholarship, not only because of its reputation but also because of the experiences gained through it, has directly impacted both my teaching and public service. I hope to see you all again soon.â\n\nâJason Gehrke (GG Scholar, 2016-2017)\n\nPlease pass along this information to any aspiring scholar whom you know or meet who might be qualified to apply. Feel free to contact Larry Myers with any questions.\n\nFrom DG Craig Burnett\n\nRotary Million Dollar Journey Reaches its Goalâ¦ and Continues\n\nAfter reaching a $1,000,000 fundraising goal early, Rotary International Districts 6220 & 6270 extend the goal deadline and dollar amount to support the Rotary Foundation during trying times\n\nA joint effort between the Wisconsin & Michigan Rotarians of districts 6220 and 6270 to raise $1,000,000 for the Rotary Foundation by October, 2020 reached its goal four months early. With that success, and with even greater need, the districts will continue the journey by raising more funds, and a new conclusion in April, 2021.\n\nA bit over one year ago, on the recommendation of Rotary International District Governors Steve Handrick and Steen Sanderhoff, their respective districts embarked on a path to collectively raise one million dollars of new gifts to the Rotary Foundation; a Million Dollar Journey. With many generous gifts â each in excess of $10,000 â from both districts, the goal was reached early, in July of 2020.\n\nWhen the Journey launched, the districts planned a celebratory dinner for all of the contributors along the fundraising pathway, to have taken place in November 2020. The presence of the COVID-19 pandemic will make that celebration impossible at that time, and the districts agreed that it should be postponed until April 29, 2021.\n\nSeeing the postponement as an opportunity, now past-governors Handrick & Sanderhoff and current district governors Scott Knaffla and Craig Burnett agreed that the districts should continue the Journeyâs effort, and have set a new goal of $2,000,000 to be reached by April 1, 2021.\n\nAs with the first part of the Journey, the minimum amount of gifts within the journey is $10,000 to qualify for attendance at the celebratory dinner. Gifts may be made in a number of ways:\n\nOutright gifts of cash or appreciated securities\n\nA three-year pledge of cash or appreciated securities\n\nA Life income agreement funded with cash, appreciated securities or real estate, including charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, or pooled income funds.\n\nA bequest commitment via a will, life insurance policy, revocable trust, or a retirement plan\n\nEach district has a team of Rotarians who stand ready to discuss the continuing campaign, give a presentation about the journey, or to interact directly with a potential donor. Donors or clubs are encouraged to contact PDG and Endowment/Major Gifts Advisor Nancy Rhodes to discuss the opportunity to add needed funds to the Rotary International Foundation during this time of pandemic and worldwide economic challenge.\n\nRotarians and others are encouraged to join in this important Journey at a time when it is truly needed.\n\nFrom Foundation Chair Mary Beth Seiser\n\nCelebrating Foundation Successes\n\nCONGRATULATIONS!! The 2019-2020 Rotary year was fantastic â and it is all because of YOU and your generosity! Despite the pandemic â or maybe because of it â you all opened your hearts and your hands and your wallets to truly provide Service Above Self.\n\nPOLIO - As Rotarians and friends worldwide pitched in, we met the $50 million goal and as a result we received the full $100 million match from the Gates Foundation. The true value in that achievement lies not only in the lives we are saving from the devastation of polio, but it also showed the world that the infrastructure we have in place to fight polio has also been vital in tracking and preventing the spread of Covid-19. Kudos to all of you!\n\nANNUAL FUND AND ENDOWMENT - We experienced a record year in contributions to the Annual Fund, and in commitments to the Endowment Fund. Generous donations from all of you, and especially from new major donors, benefactors, and bequest society members, help secure our future and guarantee that we will have funding in the future for all the wonderful humanitarian projects we accomplish.\n\nLOCAL BENEFITS - Too often we think of our Service Above Self as taking place in other parts of the world and benefitting people we will never meet. We contribute to the Foundation, and donât pay attention to where our money goes. This year has reminded us that our contributions truly do come home. In addition to the $61,000+ in district grants, most of which was for projects in your own communities, we also received a $25,000 grant from the foundation for local Covid-19 related projects. You all stepped up and provided PPEâs to health care workers and first responders, you provided food to those in need, protective equipment for a free clinic, and you filled many other COVID related needs in your own communities.\n\nMILLION DOLLAR JOURNEY - Remember that we are on our Million Dollar Journey to raise funds for the future. Contributions to the Annual Fund will provide us with working dollars in the near future, and commitments to the Endowment fund will provide us with support in years to come. Please think about what you want your Rotary Legacy to be and contact a member of the Foundation committee for more information.\n\nPAT YOURSELVES ON THE BACK! - So, letâs take time to celebrate 2019-2020 and everything that we accomplished. It was a difficult year, and many of us had hard times, but we came through it with flying colors. Now on to 2020-2021! We canât lose sight of our goal of Service Above Self. Letâs continue to share what we have with those who have less â with those who are struggling â with those who are hopeless. There is so much need, locally and around the world, and we have so much to share. It may be our time â our talents â or our treasures â but we all have something to give. THANK YOU!\n\nFrom the Nominating Committee\n\nDistrict Governor Nomination Notice for 2023-2024\n\nRotary District 6270 is now seeking candidate proposals from Rotary Clubs for the position of District Governor in the 2023-2024 Rotary Year.\n\nServing as Rotary District Governor (DG) is a great honor. Governors are the official representative of Rotary International in the district. The mission of a Governor is to lead clubs, inspire Rotarians, and engage the public by articulating Rotaryâs role in our community. District Governors serve for one Rotary year, from July 1 to June 30. Governors are actively engaged in District decision-making leading up to their year as Governor. Serving as District Governor is a life-changing experience. As they prepare, Governors receive training, plan, assemble their teams of volunteers and collaborate to create a budget. You can learn more about serving as District Governor by downloading Lead Your District: Governor, published by Rotary International.\n\nDuties of the District Governor (DG)\n\nThe DG is the officer of RI in the district functioning under the general supervision of the RI Board. The governor leads and supports the clubs in the district by inspiring and motivating them and by ensuring continuity within the District.\n\nDuring the year in office, clubs will look to the DG for leadership and support as they carry out service projects and participate in Rotary programs. Candidates should have strong leadership and decision-making skills.\n\nThe DG works to support and strengthen clubs, organize new clubs, and grow membership; encourage contributions and other support for The Rotary Foundation; promote positive public image for Rotary and serve as spokesperson for the district. The DG works to develop a safe environment for youth participants; conducts a district conference and other meetings; and trains club leaders. The DG works with the finance committee to prepare budgets, provide reports and help administer Rotary District Designated Funds. The DG works with governor-line, District Board and other district leaders (including implementing a district plan and appointing Assistant Governors and Committee Chairs).\n\nMinimum Qualifications for Nominees\n\nBe a District 6270 Rotarian in good standing.\n\nBe a Rotarian maintaining full qualifications of active Rotary membership\n\nMust have served a full term (1-year) as a Rotary club president, or as charter president from the date of charter to 30 June (six-month minimum), at the time of nomination. (Per RI Bylaws 16.070.3)\n\nMust have completed a minimum of seven (7) years of Rotary Membership, by the time of taking office.\n\nNominees must complete a Governor-nominee Form. The form is found on District 6270 website, in âsite pagesâ listing.\n\nFrom DG Craig Burnett\n\nRotary Opens Opportunities\n\nAs we embark on the 2020 â 2021 Rotary year under the banner of RI President Holger Knaackâs theme, Rotary Opens Opportunities, the entire Rotary world finds itself challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, and widespread global economic challenge.\n\nIn the face of such difficult times, many outside of Rotary would retreat from their volunteer activities. That is not the Rotary way; we are People of Action, and working to change the world for the better is in our blood. We have already seen this throughout our district as clubs are finding new and innovative ways to meet virtually or via creative and safe social distancing. Clubs in our district are also executing a diverse array of service projects. Many are different than those the clubs had planned before the pandemic, yet through these projects our clubs are continuing to serve our world.\n\nAs we move forward through this Rotary year in the shadow of COVID-19, it is critically important that we stay safe and be adaptable. If we do not take care of ourselves, our loved-ones, and our community through careful action to prevent infection, we will be less able to act on our motto, Service Above Self. While the pandemic is still active, each and every Rotary event must be completely optional for in-person participation.\n\nWith that limitation, though, there are still many things we can do to continue to serve our world, and I encourage each club to brainstorm creatively, looking for novel approaches that are both safe and effective.\n\nIt is also a time to embrace the unexpected opportunities that will arise amidst this crisis. Examples include building new and innovated membership and meeting models that work better when traditional in-person meetings are not being held (and may continue to work well in the long-term), inviting potential members, past members, and past alumni to join via virtual meetings, creative service projects to support communities harmed by the coronavirus, and more.\n\nI urge us all to keep a positive focus on finding opportunities that will allow us to continue to serve. If we work together in optimism, we can do more than just survive â we have the opportunity to grow and thrive.\n\nFrom RI Foundation Trustee Jennifer Jones\n\nCOVID-19 #RotaryResponds Telethon **Changed to May 2nd**\n\nRotary International is pleased to share with you that we are championing a COVID-19 #RotaryResponds one-hour Telethon to raise critical funds for disaster relief. This telethon will be simulcast on all Rotary International social channels and is anticipated to reach more than 100-thousand viewers with a goal of raising more than $1-million dollars.\n\nRotaryâs 1.2-milion members across the globe have taken swift action. More than $3-million dollars from Rotaryâs Disaster Relief Fund has already been put into action on the frontlines to battle COVID-19. Additionally, millions more have been raised by our People of Action - they have responded quickly and are truly saving lives. Now, we need to do more and the need for additional funding is a priority.\n\nThe Telethon date is **Saturday, May 2, 2020** (NOTE NEW DATE), 10:00am US Central Daylight Time (Chicago, Illinois). The telethon will also showcase how our Polio infrastructure is helping to combat COVID-19 in real time.\n\nWe will hear stories of hope from Rotarians across the globe as they share with us what they are doing to help their communities. We will hear stories of inspiration from Rotaract, Interact and friends of Rotary.\n\nOur request: We are asking for your participation in either the form of a short ten to fifteen second video or a tweet on the day of the event at #RotaryResponds and @Rotary. These videos will provide hope, gratitude, and inspire our members. This does not need to be professionally packaged, we expect that you can simply record this on your iPad or phone. You will then send it via the instructions below.\n\nIf you would prefer to tweet then we would ask that you tweet during the broadcast time. We would appreciate learning of your message in advance so that we are ready to share this during the broadcast.\n\nHow to record your video message:\n\nYour tone should be caring and hopeful, our goal is to comfort and to inspire.\n\nPlease use the language of your choice, Rotarians are in 200 nations around the world, and the telethon will simulcast in 8 languages.\n\nUse your iPad or phone to record your message.\n\nPlease record in landscape (hold the device horizontally not vertically).\n\nDue to the very tight timeline, we are asking for files by Tuesday, April 28th.\n\nPlease select one of these options:\n\nOption 1: I want to add my voice to say thank you Rotarians.

Many people have been laid off, working from home or working on the front lines in supermarkets, hospitals or essential businesses or institutions. Rotary meetings and events have been cancelled and we are all trying to adjust to a new virtual reality. Rotary is more important than ever. It is in times like this Rotarians step up to the plate, show leadership, compassion and strength.\n\nRotary International is similarly adjusting and trying to accommodate the ever-changing needs of the Clubs and Districts. Access funds have been made available for emergency District Grants and our District Grants Committee is accepting applications and will payout grants as soon as possible. It would be great to have more funds available, but this is a reminder of how important it is to donate to the Rotary Foundation.\n\nIt is important we continue to meet and do good work. If not in person, then virtually. Don Griffing and Andy DeWitt have offered to help Clubs sign up with Zoom, please see contact information below. Several Clubs have already started to meet on-line with great success, and I encourage you to sign up. For some of us it is outside our comfort zone, but we can all learn, and we will be better for it when this is over, and the virtual environment is part of our everyday life.\n\nAndy DeWitt aadewitt@gmail.com\n\nIt is important we learn from each other and the District has established two folders on the District website where Rotarians and Clubs can post and exchange ideas, projects and best practices. Please communicate with each other, it will increase our reach and impact.\n\nRightfully so, we are caught in the very serious current situation, but we also must think long term and cannot forgot the projects and goals we have set. Polio is an example of the healthcare crises that started in 1940-1950s and is still present in the world. We need to finish the job; we are so close. Please keep donating to PolioPlus.\n\nThe programs of The Rotary Foundation continue to need your support. Janice and I just returned from a field trip to Guatemala with a group of Rotarians and Rotaractors from Fond du Lac and Milwaukee. The impact Rotary has is impressive. I would like to tell you and your Club more about it.\n\nIt was very difficult to cancel our District Convention, and so it must have been to cancel the International Convention. Janice and I looked forward to seeing you and celebrating an otherwise successful year.\n\nStay active and healthy and let Rotary Connect the World.\n\nFrom PDG Jeffrey Reed\n\nReflections on Rotary in India\n\nDuring January 2020, I returned to India (location of our first D6270 Friendship Exchange in 2018) to visit clubs and projects in Cochin, Coimbatore, Maheshwar, Delhi, and Jhansi, for 2 weeks. The journey involved interaction with more than eight Rotary Clubs and visits to over a dozen Rotary projects.\n\nNational Immunization Day (NID) 2020 India. Our Garg NID 2020 Team of nine from the USA (CA, OR, WA, & WI), organized by PDG Anil Garg (RID 5240), received briefings from WHO and UNICEF in Delhi, and from WHO - Jhansi. We participated in immunization activities in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, including the End Polio Now Parade, Booth Day immunization drive, WHO Certification reporting, and House-to-House immunization confirmation activities. We were welcomed by the four Rotary Clubs in Jhansi, a metropolitan area with over 2 million people and several hundred thousand children to immunize. Planning for the NID was extremely detailed. Dedication of people involved in the effort was observable. Over 1,200 booths were operated on Booth Day for people to bring their children to receive the oral polio vaccine. The next day, NID door-to-door activities commenced as NID workers checked to see whether children at each residence had received their polio vaccination â the left pinkie is colored purple, okay, vaccinated, otherwise we should vaccinate. The partnership among WHO, UNICEF, RI, US CDC, Indian Government, and Gates Foundation is critical to continued polio-free success in India.\n\nSave Limbs Global Grant â Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. South India is facing a growing problem with Diabetes. The Rotary Foundation recently approved a Global Grant initiated by Rotary Club of Coimbatore Cosmopolitan, with the partnership of Fond du Lac Morning Rotary and support of Rotary Club of Milwaukee, in partnership with Mowthi Hospital in Coimbatore. The project will conduct camps every other month for two years to provide education and treatment to diabetics with a goal of avoiding foot amputation. My visit enabled a tour of the hospital site, detailed discussion of the project with hospital personnel and club officers overseeing the grant, experience of the educational program and interaction with current diabetic foot patients at the Mowthi Hospital.\n\nOther Projects visited. In Cochin, Rotary Clubs have supported a government hospital, providing a CT Scanner, a medical linear accelerator, dialysis machines, and other equipment. Other clubs in Cochin have secured $1.3 million in funding for low cost shelters for people who lost their homes in the August 2018 flooding. In Maheshwar, the Jhoole project and Maheshwar Rotary Club have trained over 3,000 young women in textile skills at the Womenâs Empowerment Centre, sponsored a Weaving Center, sponsored a school, and provided a home for aged poor. In Jhansi, Rotarians have sponsored a primary school, provided free meals weekly for the poor and homeless and support a medical college.\n\nThis is the Centennial Year of Rotary in India and Rotary in India is growing. Clubs in India are celebrating their legacy. Many Indian clubs have invested significant time, effort, resources and energy in projects to build their community and provide for the less fortunate. Visiting Rotarians in India provides inspiration for and validation of our Rotary Motto âService Above Self.â\n\nFrom Mark Daniel Maloney & Holger Knaack\n\nRotary's Role in Battling Coronavirus\n\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus is affecting every aspect of our lives in real time, and this puts Rotarians in an unfamiliar place. As People of Action, we are most comfortable when we are fully engaged in the world â moving freely, meeting openly, and offering helping hands. These are very difficult times for people who, like us, are at our best when we are learning, growing, and servingâtogether.\n\nWe are also leaders in our communities, and these times call for leadership. In many ways, this also is our time. We have proven abilities to reach out and collaborate to offer immediate help to people in need at a rapid pace. These are precisely the skills needed all over the world today. The global effort against COVID-19 depends on actions taken in every country. Rotary has the unique ability to help improve those efforts in every community and every country.\n\nUsing all the technology we have at our disposal, we as Rotarians can continue to reach out and collaborate on big projects with Rotary clubs, Rotaractors, and Interactors. There are a number of examples where Rotary clubs are helping health authorities communicate best practices or provide needed equipment or support that have been shared with our leaders around the world.\n\nAs Rotaryâs president and president-elect, we have been thinking of these issues very seriously in regard to upcoming Rotary events. As you may be aware, we have made the difficult decision to cancel two Rotary Presidential Conferences honoring our relationship with the United Nations- one in Paris, another in Rome. In the near term, we recommend that Rotary districts and clubs cancel or postpone meetings or events following the advice of national and local health officials.\n\nWe know that clubs and districts are seizing the opportunity to become leaders in their communities and are making better use of technology in this time of need. For example, a Rotary e-club in Italy held a live online session about COVID-19 awareness, a Taiwan club worked with companies and a pharmacy association to donate 1,600 bottles of hand sanitizer to the city of Ji-Long, and Rotary clubs in Sri Lanka helped upgrade software and hardware for the health promotion bureau to assist its social messaging.\n\nWe cannot know quite yet what path this virus will take. We know we can play a role to help âflatten the curve,â reducing the number of cases in the short term to allow our health systems to address this issue. If the collective global effort helps bring the situation under control, then we hope to re-embrace our core values at the 2020 Rotary Convention in Honolulu. Our time together will have greater meaning and purpose than ever.\n\nPlease know that we are taking a close, continuing look at our plans for the convention in June to make sure all attendeesâ safety will be protected. We are following the lead of the worldâs most trusted sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for their guidance. We want you to be able to make decisions about what is best for you and your families in terms of attending this yearâs event.\n\nIn the meantime, this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate that Rotary Connects the World in innovative ways. We should be closely following the advice of the WHO and local health authorities. Again, this includes canceling Rotary club events and meetings in the short term to reduce unnecessary interactions that could cause infections. We can put a greater emphasis on the work we do in our communities by helping our less fortunate neighbors cope with the effects of isolation and fear, or by supporting our health authorities to address this situation.\n\nWe are dealing with this situation in real time. Please visit the rotary.org COVID-19 response page for ongoing updates.\n\nThis is an unprecedented challenge for nearly all of us. But it is also an opportunity for Rotarians to find new, meaningful ways to lead individuals and communities to connect and do good in the world.\n\nWe have never been prouder to be part of an organization that does so much to protect and strengthen our communities, at home and across the globe.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nMark Daniel Maloney\n\n2019-2020, President, Rotary International\n\nHolger Knaack\n\n2020-21, President, Rotary International\n\nDistrict 6270 Global Grant Scholars Continue to Excel\n\nDistrict 6270 Global Grant Scholars Continue to Excel\n\nDistrict 6270 currently has two Global Grant Scholars who continue to excel in the pursuit of their graduate programs of study.\n\nCiara J. McHugh is in her second year of a Ph.D. research program at the Senator George J Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice at Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Her Global Grant Scholarship award, initially awarded in 2018, has been stretched over two years to assist in funding. Earlier this year she learned that she had earned the âAlan Graham Fund Travel Scholarshipâ from Queens University to undertake fieldwork in the United States during this academic year. She is exploring how police and communities interact around the world, looking at tensions between minority groups and police forces and how we might rethink relationships between the two. You can follow her studies and adventures at her blog site: https://ciarajmchugh.weebly.com.\n\nW. Leif Van Grinsven is District 6270âs Global Grant Scholarship recipient for 2019-2020. A native of Franklin, Wisconsin, and graduate of Wisconsin Lutheran H.S., Van Grinsven graduated from Wheaton College this year with a 3.98 cumulative grade-point average in Interdisciplinary Studies. He was a three-time Division III Google Cloud Academic All-American and a four-time all-American in men's track & field, including two times this past season. This summer he engaged in a United Nations internship in the Netherlands. As a Development Studies Masters student at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex in the United Kingdom (the #1 Development Studies program in the world), he has been diving into development, reading hundreds of pages, attending dozens of lectures, and meeting with professors and students who have researched and worked around the world. You can follow his progress and dreams for the future at his blog site: https://betterworldbetteryou.blog/hello-world. You can even join his email list to be alerted each time he updates his blog.\n\nFrom District Governor Steen Sanderhoff\n\nNovember is Foundation Month\n\nThe Foundation helps fund the many programs and projects Rotary offers. Polio Eradication, Scholarships, District Grants, Vocational Training Teams, Global Grants, Disaster Relief Fund, just to mention a few. These programs help and support Clubs around the world provide resources, make our projects successful, and change the lives of people in our communities. I encourage all of you and your Clubs to utilize the opportunities the Foundation offers.\n\nIt is important we support the Foundation with charitable donations. Every Rotarian â Every Year. $10, $25, $50, $100 or more. What you are willing or able to, we ask you to donate. Sign up for automatic withdrawals from your checking account or charge to your credit card. It is easy and painless, and it makes a big difference in the lives of many people.\n\nAs mentioned earlier this year, District 6220 and 6270 started the Million Dollar Journey and we are working diligently to reach our goal. I would like to hear from you, if you are considering making a Major Gift or Bequest to the Foundation. We have Rotarians from TRF and the District that can help you find the right way to give.\n\nWe just celebrated World Polio Day and Iâd like to thank all the Clubs that participated and raised funds for Polio Eradication. I have heard of many clever and successful ways Clubs have raised money. Thank you so much for all your efforts. At our District Foundation Dinner our District celebrated all our accomplishments and recognized individuals and Clubs for their generosity and support of the Foundation. I hope you were able to participate.\n\nThe Global Grant and the VTT committees are looking for projects in this Rotary year. If your Club is looking to send a team or is in the process of planning a project, please contact John Hein at JHein@dkattorneys.com .\n\nMembership, Membership, Membership is our most important focus. New members, retain members, diversify membership are some of the topics we need to focus on. We have seen a net loss of 2 members in the first quarter of this Rotary year. We are still moving in the wrong direction. The District has a very effective and active membership committee and I hope you will ask for their input when needed. Rotary has so much to offer and I am convinced people in our communities want to be part of our success.\n\nThe District has started a âfriendlyâ Membership Competition. We will recognize the 10 clubs with the most net gain with Paul Harris points for Paul Harris Awards. Are we competitive or not? Letâs make a difference.\n\nThe District is moving forward with the implementation of our strategic plan. Please be a part of the process. Have you updated your Club website lately? How are you are taking advantage of social media? Are you bragging and telling you community about your clubâs success stories? We owe it to ourselves; we have so many positive stories to tell!!!\n\nAnd we before we know it, it is Thanksgiving. A time for Family, Thanks, and Reflection on all our opportunities and accomplishments.\n\nTogether, let Rotary Connect the World.\n\nFrom DG Steen Sanderhoff\n\nSeptember is Basic Education & Literacy Month\n\nHard to believe summer is almost over and the kids are back to school. Now we sit behind the yellow school buses waiting for the kids to get on board.\n\nOne of the areas of focus of the Rotary Foundation is âBasic Education and Literacyâ. Education is a very important component to the welfare and success of any individual and for society as a whole. We as Rotarians, community and business leaders, have an opportunity to help make sure our children and young people receive a good education and prepare them for a successful life. Through our international reach and the support of the Rotary Foundation, we can also improve the lives of people in the third world. Basic education and literacy usher in prosperity and lift communities out of poverty. Many Clubs in our District are already involved in programs and I encourage you to learn, adapt the best practices, and start programs in your community. Let âRotary Connect the Worldâ.\n\nWe also need to continue to educate ourselves, exchange ideas with other Clubs and inspire each other. The District is offering;\n\nClub Leadership Development Workshops\n\nThursday, September 12, 2019 / 5:00pm - 8:30pm / MATC Oak Creek Technical College / 6665 S. Howell Avenue, Oak Creek, WI 53154\n\nSaturday, October 5, 2019 / 8:30am - 12pm / Waukesha County Technical College / 800 Main Street, Pewaukee, WI 53072\n\nThursday, October 17, 2019 / 5:00pm - 8:30pm / Pine Hills Country Club / 4914 Superior Avenue, Sheboygan, WI 53081\n\nAs space is limited, please register as soon as possible, with Dana Kohlmeyer at dana.kohlmeyer@rotary6270.org. All Rotarians are welcome.\n\nIn the first two months of the new Rotary year, I have had the pleasure of visiting more than half of the Club in our District. I am very impressed and have been inspired by enthusiasm and commitment to âMake a Differenceâ. I cannot wait to visit the remaining Clubs and learn about your good work in the communities.\n\nEnjoy the last days of summer and letâs together âConnect the Worldâ.\n\nFrom District Governor Kola Alayande\n\nMay is Youth Service Month\n\nin the Rotary Calendar. As we all know, youth (40 years or younger per Rotary) are the future and we need to make sure we do all we can to assist with mentoring and strategically positioning them to take our district to the next level. As we are all aware, two critical areas of concern for Rotary International are membership and youth engagement! Let us do what we can to increase the membership of the youth.\n\nThe District Conference (DualCon 2019) registration is still below expectations despite attempts to reasonably accommodate requests and registration extensions. While we are still behind district 6220 in registration numbers, those of us who will be there are planning to have an amazing time.\n\nFor the Rotary (Presidential) Citation, currently only 3 clubs have met the requirements to earn it. Understandably, there was an issue a few months ago with tracking standings on Rotary.org but that has been resolved so members who have âMy Rotaryâ accounts can view the Rotary Citation Recipients Report by signing in to My Rotary. Then, under Manage, in Club & District Administration, go to Reports and, in the Awards section, youâll see Rotary Citation or click this link (http://msgfocus.rotary.org/c/1psCtorFYlgokW5kRCZTDaKYDl) directly if logged into My Rotary. Please check it to see what your club is missing and what your club needs to do to earn the Citation. It is a fairly easy process and I have attached the guide to this message. Please letâs ramp up the numbers as we have 60 days to make this happen!\n\nMembership acquisition contest - Only one club (Wautoma) of the initial five winning clubs provided the required proof to get the $500 gift card for use in Hamburg, Germany so since there are still four $500 gift-cards left to give away, there will be another review of membership data up till April 30th to see if other clubs stepped up in their recruitment efforts and the 4 remaining $500 gift cards will be given to the new clubs that meets the same criteria of having a registered member who will be attending the international Convention and using the gift card while there.\n\nThe Paul Harris Awards for the top 10 member sponsors will be awarded/announced at the annual general meeting during the district conference (DualCon) and the data being used is from July 1st, 2018 â April 30th, 2019.\n\nFinally, one of my goals for this Rotary year is the creation of a D6270 Business e-Directory and it is in the works so any Rotarian in the district (self-employed or otherwise) that wants to have their name and business listed should provide the information below to Dana Kohlmeyer (dana.kohlmeyer@rotary6270.org) and copy me (kola.alayande@rotary6270.org)\n\nBusiness Name:\n\nPrimary Area of Business Focus:\n\nRotarianâs Name:\n\nPosition/Title:\n\nPreferred Business Number:\n\nPreferred Business Email:\n\nWebsite address of the business:\n\nLinkedIn:\n\nFacebook:\n\nThe information above is needed on or before May 15th, 2019 (a window of two weeks from today.)\n\nThank you all and have a great month.\n\nFrom PDG Julie Craig\n\n2019 Women in Rotary Event and the Sylvia Whitlock Leadership Award\n\nPlease join us for our 2019 Women in Rotary Event at the International Convention in Hamburg!\n\nThis event will be held June 4, 2019 from 5 - 7 pm at NORD EVENT PANORAMADECK. The modern, light-filled NORD EVENT PANORAMADECK offers stunning 360Â° views over the Alster and city â indeed, everything that Hamburg has to offer.\n\nHighlighting the event will be presenters touching on specific topics with the goal of inspiring and helping women while on their journey in Rotary, and to help women become more involved in Rotary. Stay tuned as we announce who this year's speakers will be! After all of the presentations are complete, the presenters will serve on a panel and will be open for your questions.\n\nAmazing food for the evening will entail some local German favorites. The selections include: four different Mini Fish sandwiches from the \"Hamburger Fischmarkt\", potato salad from Northern Germany with meatballs, goulash soup, two varieties of cinnamon flavored pastry and hanseastic biscuits!\n\nFor complete details and to purchase your tickets go to 2019 Women in Rotary\n\nPlease note: Tickets will be refunded ONLY if the promoted event is canceled. Women in Rotary takes no responsibility for any travel-related costs incurred by Rotarians and their guests.\n\nTicket purchases will be charged in USD. If you are not able to process this event with your currency please email Julie Craig at julie@gjmllp.com for assistance in obtaining event tickets.\n\nNot going to Hamburg? You can still be part of Women in Rotary by nominating a Rotarian you know (female or male) who has contributed to the success of Women in Rotary for the 2019 Sylvia Whitlock Leadership Award. Criteria and a nomination form for this annual award can be found at 2019 SWLA Nominations. Deadline for nominations is May 15, 2019.\n\nFrom District Governor Kola Alayande\n\nApril is Maternal and Child Health Month\n\nApril is here and I am sure glad to see some signs of Spring around us. The month of April is Rotary Internationalâs month for Maternal and Child Health which is something that is critical to the foundation of any communityâs growth or survival. According to the American Public Health Association, âfar too many women, infants and children worldwide still have little or no access to essential, quality health services and education, clean air and water, and adequate sanitation and nutrition.âImproving the well-being of infants, children and mothers should be an important public health goal for every country because their well-being impacts and determines the health of the next generation but unfortunately, that is not always the case in different parts of the world. As Rotarians, letâs continue to locally or globally support projects that positively impact the well-being of mothers, children and infants with our selfless services, and contributions.\n\nWith regards to the dual district conference (DualCon 2019), we are seeing some registration numbers (currently less than 60 people are registered from our district) and I know we can much do better than that in a district of over 2700 members. It will be sad for District 6220, with its clubs being the farthest to the event venue and having less members, to outdo us in Rotarian participation (as of today, they currently are.) Please note that the block of rooms on hold at the hotel/resort has a cutoff date of April 26, 2019 so kindly register via the website at www.dualcon2019.com and if you still do not see the hotel reservation code in the special note on your order receipt, please contact Dana Kohlmeyer (dana.kohlmeyer@rotary6270.org) or myself (kola.alayande@rotary6270.org) for the hotel registration code.\n\nThere is upbeat news for the district in terms of club development, with the recent formation of a second satellite club in the district to be officially known as the Rotary Satellite Club of Mequon-Milwaukee Afterhours Passport (RSCofMMAP.)\n\nAlso, there was a positive uptick in the registrations for the Rotary International Convention in Hamburg because according to the message I received from RI yesterday, we now have 52 people registered to attend, which is 4 more than it was 2 weeks ago.\n\nThanks to everyone and have a great month.\n\nFrom District Governor Kola Alayande\n\nAugust is Rotary Membership Month\n\nHello fellow Rotarians! It is an honor to be your District Governor and I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can during my club visits and tenure as District Governor.\n\nThe month of August is a month in the Rotary calendar that focuses on Membership and honestly, there is no more important issue in Rotary North America today than membership. Rotary International, in acknowledgement of this issue, has via the Council of Legislation created a lot of flexibility in the ways clubs operate to accommodate the changes in peopleâs lifestyles. These flexibilities are prominent in when, where and how clubs meet and the types of membership clubs can offer. Let us continue to utilize these options to start an upward membership growth trend in our clubs and district. Many resources can be found at https://my.rotary.org/en/learning-reference/learn-topic/membership .\n\nAn award/recognition program will be initiated to reward the top 5 clubs in the district with per capita growth in the first half of this Rotary year (July â December 2018) as well as an awards/recognition program for the top 10 Rotarian sponsors in the district. Exact details will be communicated to all members after the first quarterly board meeting.\n\nMy simple tip for membership recruitment is to just ASK! Donât presume, or assume, just ASK!\n\nHave a fabulous August and God bless you all as you continue to selflessly serve!\n\nFrom District Governor Jeff Reed\n\nJune is Rotary Fellowship Month\n\nThis is my final monthly message as your District Governor. Thank you for your support this year! It has been great to make many new Rotary friends and see old friends as I have visited clubs around the district. Letâs keep in touch. There is more ahead for us to do to Make A Difference in our communities, our District, and around the world.\n\nCongratulations to Craig Burnett, Oshkosh Southwest Rotary Club, who was confirmed as District Governor Nominee Designee (DGND) at the District Annual Meeting on May 4 at TriCon 2018. Craig becomes District Governor Nominee on July 1st and will serve as District Governor in 2020-2021.\n\nToronto â the Annual RI Convention â is rapidly approaching June 23 through 27. I look forward to seeing old friends from around the world and making to new friends. I am excited to hear this yearâs plenary speakers â HRH The Princess Royal, Princess Anne; Helen Clark, former Prime Minister of New Zealand; Dr. Isis Mejias, WASRAG ambassador; Jane Nelson, Director of the Corporate Responsibility Initiative, Harvard Kennedy School; and so many more. Over 90 breakout sessions are planned, such as: Human Trafficking and Slavery; Money and Food Do Grow on Trees; Rotary Business School; Community Well Being; Supporting Peace Through Social Enterprise, and so forth. The House of Friendship, always huge, offers an opportunity to talk with people involved in service projects around the world and each of Rotaryâs Focus areas. And, it will be another visit to Toronto.\n\nDistrict 6270 Rotarians âMaking a Differenceâ. Eleven Rotarians from our District were selected to receive this recognition for 2017-18. Nominees described how each person\n\nÂ· Is an outstanding Rotarian\n\nÂ· Goes above and beyond\n\nÂ· Makes a real difference â in the club, in the community, in Rotary\n\nÂ· Shows that they are a role model for other Rotarians\n\nEach of these people has Made a Difference in their club, their community and Rotary. Awards were presented to many at the TriCon 2018 District Annual Business Meeting. Congratulations to:\n\nPete Bosch\n\nRC of Waukesha\n\nKelly Hicks\n\nRC of Neenah\n\nSue Hebner\n\nRC of Mitchell Field\n\nGeorge Matthews\n\nRC of Milwaukee North Sunrise\n\nMary McCormick\n\nRC of Milwaukee\n\nMichael Reinbold\n\nRC of Sheboygan Early Bird\n\nTJ Rinaldi\n\nRC of Wautoma\n\nSandi Roehrig\n\nRC of Fond du Lac\n\nPam Seidl\n\nRC of Neenah\n\nBarbara Senn\n\nRC of Fond du Lac Morning\n\nDavid Wolbrink\n\nRC of Hartford\n\nFrom District Governor Jeff Reed\n\nDistrict Governor's Message for January\n\nHappy Rotary New Year! By now, you have probably established your Rotary Goals for 2018. Maybe itâs involvement in a new service project, a new fundraising idea for your club, joining a Rotary Fellowship or Action Group, or a plan to contribute to The Rotary Foundation. Whatever it is - have a wonderful Rotary 2018.\n\nIt is January - we are half way through the 2017-18 Rotary Year. There has been much great activity. As I review the District Calendar, I see are a number of activities around the District posted for January and February. Of special note, I think, is the Human Trafficking Event on January 11 in Elkhorn. If you want other Rotarians to know about an event your club is hosting, let our District Administrative Assistant Dana Kohlmeyer know so that she can post your event.\n\nMy counterparts and I are in the final stages of preparation for travel to India in the Rotary Friendship Exchange. All indications are that it will be an exciting adventure. We will let you know what we see and learn.\n\nDonât forget to register for TriCon 2018 Wisconsin, our 3-district Annual Conference in the Wisconsin Dells, May 4 thru 6.\n\nJanuary is Vocational Service month in Rotary\n\nVocational Service has been a focus from the start of Rotary as noted by Past RI President Cliff Dochterman at the Presidential Celebration in 2003. He asserted that âNo matter how much we like to think that Paul Harris and his friends created Rotary for such noble ideas of humanitarian service, goodwill and world understanding â it just was not the case. Rotary was started for business reasons and professional purposes.â Dochterman also reminded us that the Rotary Code of Business Ethics was adopted in 1916. http://www.rotaryroom711.org/vocational-service-rotarys-first-concept/\n\nFrom District Governor Mary Beth Seiser\n\nJanuary - Our Halfway Marker\n\nWelcome to 2015! Happy New Year to you and your families, and may it be a very happy and healthy year for everyone.\n\nI can’t believe we are already at the midway point of the Rotary year! That means, of course, that we should be at the midway point of achieving our goals for the year. We discussed goals at my official club visits and I ask that you take a few minutes now to review those goals, both at the club level and at your personal level. If you are on track – congratulations ! If not, it may be time to review your plan of action and put it in motion.\n\nA quick review of the goals we discussed:\n\nMEMBERSHIP - The more members we have, the more people we can help and the more good we can do in the world. Keep your ‘ASK’ in gear and grow your clubs.

I spent the first 25 days racing to the phone every time it rang, in the hopes that, this time, it would be Rotary calling to tell me where my exchange year was going to be spent. When the call finally came, and I found out I was going to Denmark, the first thing I said was, “where is that?” After a quick search in google, I had my answer, and my excitement grew exponentially.\n\nIn the months leading up to my departure, I began researching Denmark. I wanted to know as much as possible about the foreign country that would soon not be so foreign. I researched the food, the climate, and the main attractions: anything I could find was fair game. Through all of this, I constantly reminded myself not to get too high of expectations, in case they weren’t met. I arrived in Denmark expecting to ride my bike everywhere and to eat lots of potatoes. Other than that, I had remained fairly open to the possibilities of what this year would bring with it."
