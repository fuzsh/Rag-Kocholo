        "text": "I'd be curious to get folks' reaction to this. There's obviously a huge gap between GenAI hype and reality. I think this is rooted in a basic misapprehension of what GenAI does. GenAI writes good writing in response to prompts and whatever material it is exposed to. The writing is good and if you prompt something that makes sense \"write an essay on why Jackie Robinson was the greatest second baseman of all time\" it will write a very good essay. For us as humans the writing is often the ANSWER, but this is where GenAI is confusing. The writing is the writing. So if you're looking for an answer \"who was the greatest second baseman of all time\" you will get something well-written that may or may not be the answer. The more obscure the question, the less likely you are to get a \"correct\" answer. If I put the same question in Google, it will take me to what various people have written that responds to that question. Those people and their answers are validated by how frequently other people go to their page, and whether over time they're seen as authoritative sources."
