Walk away with an understanding of the current legislative landscape that impacts your business.\n\nThe World is Upside-down. So What Now?\n\nPamela Q. Devata, Seyfarth Shaw LLP\n\nThe world has changed dramatically in the last few months. From shelter in place to rush to hire, to court closings and alternative resources. But one thing has remained constant-the need to be compliant. This session will focus on new legal trends and theories, hot issues for regulators, COVID specific challenges and what your clients expect from you during these challenging times.\n\n*Yes, It's Probably Time to Reconsider Your Report Language And Structure!\n\nScott Paler, DeWitt LLP\n\nMany consumer reporting agencies have not reconsidered their report structure and wording in years. This issue is effectively on “auto-pilot.” But the structure and wording of reports impacts everything from the end-user’s ability to interpret results, to the CRA’s ability to satisfy its accuracy and completeness obligations, to plaintiff attorneys’ capacity to make “recklessness” and “willfulness” arguments. This session, led by attorney and frequent PBSA presenter Scott Paler, will provide a series of common practice tips for improving the quality of reports.\n\nBusiness Track\n\nMONITORING - Beyond the buzzword into the data and its uses\n\nVince Pascarella, Wholesale Screening Solutions; Brian Kelly, Appriss Insights; John Kloos, BackChecked LLC (Moderator)\n\nAside from becoming a buzzword, Monitoring or Continous Screening for arrest and court records is the newest class of service in the industry.

This includes the platforms, data centers and cloud computing providers that serve our industry. Perhaps you are preparing for such audit yourself. Or, you may just want to know what your suppliers have achieved. Either way, you'll hear from somebody who just completed the audit, with the experience fresh in mind. What did it take? What did it cost? Was it worth the effort?\n\nThe Cost of Not Knowing Your Vendor Network\n\nKevin Horval, IntelliCorp Records; Andy Hellman, Accurate Background\n\nScreeners are increasingly being challenged by their customers to demonstrate their vendors have gone through a solid vendor credentialing component. Regulators and plaintiffs use vendor credentialing information (or lack of them) as reasons for negative findings. This session will provide suggestions for how to credential a new vendor, ongoing assessments, and how to document proof.\n\nThe Old Rules Don't Apply: Learn What Buyers Want And How To Sell More In A COVID Environment\n\nKevin Bachman, The CRA Doctor\n\nA great CRA’s value lies in their ability to deliver on a moving target of often contradictory client demands. In depth, but cheaper. Faster, but fewer errors. Candidate driven, but low abandonment. What makes a shop great is doing so without abandoning their core principles. In a COVID world, employers are reviewing their relationships like never before, so shops need to consider a different approach to selling. Attendees will learn how to create, package, present and persuade employers that YOU’RE the best choice!\n\nMindful Awareness and Coaching Skills for Leaders\n\nScott Sadler, Creative Conflict Solutions\n\nIn today's ever changing world we must discover within us the tools to cope with stress, anxiety and fear and help those around us as well.

We will discuss and practice these skills and more in this session.\n\nServing the Gig Economy-Challenges and Opportunities for Background Screeners\n\nLester Rosen, Employment Screening Resources\n\nA significant number of workers are engaged through the Gig economy and that number is only expected to increase. There are numerous Gig or “platform” firms offering a wide variety of services or asset sharing. Background checks are often part of the marketing and risk strategies used by firms in order to create consumer trust. However, it is a great deal more complex than it sounds and likely to be a source of litigation in the future. This session will explore potential landmines and traps.\n\nEnsuring the Lights Are on and Somebody is Home\n\nScott Kimball, TazWorks\n\nThere was a time when a business continuity/disaster recovery plan meant having a box of backup tapes that you hauled off periodically for safekeeping in your sister-in-law’s basement. That is insufficient in today’s always on world, where your clients depend on you to deliver services on time, every time, all the time. Come learn strategies to ensure your business and data is highly available, scalable, and durable, regardless of whether it is a rogue backhoe or a novel Coronavirus that threatens to shut you down.\n\nTales from the Trenches - How do End Users Indentity a Background Screening Partner\n\nNikki Holton, Eli Lilly and Company; Jason Morris, Morris Group Consulting, LLC\n\nThis session will discuss how end users work together collectively and within their organization to idenitfy a background screenign partner that meets their needs.

Can you afford for it to go away? As marijuana legalization spreads across the country, state laws are challenging an employer's rights to perform pre-employment drug testing. Ban-the-Box changed background screening for employers and similarly, the rules changing for drug screening. This session will address the cause of the change, present future strategies for revenue retention and improvement.\n\nHow to Prepare Now for a Drug-Free Post-Pandemic Workplace\n\nWilliam Current, Current Consulting Group, LLC\n\nPre-employment drug testing has never been more important as companies prepare their drug-free workplace programs for the end of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Studies show substance abuse increases dramatically during national crisis and remains elevated for months afterward. Combine that with “new” unemployed workers, people who had jobs before the pandemic, and who will want to find a job again when it ends. Companies need to secure a safe and drug-free workplace with quick, efficient, and cost-effective pre-employment drug testing, background checks, and COVID testing.\n\nWeed at Work: How Employers are Clearing Through the Haze\n\nJennifer Mora, Seyforth Shaw LLP\n\nLaws and public opinion regarding marijuana are rapidly evolving.

Finally, we’ll discuss how adjudication can be done when a hit is found.\n\nAre you subject to GDPR & UK Data Privacy Regimes?\n\nKerstin Bagus, NetForce Globacl LLC; Kevin Coy, Arnall Golden Gregory LLP\n\nOrganizations outside of the EEA and UK may be subject to GDPR and / or the UK Data Privacy regulations. If they are, there are many obligations that follow, including having a local Representative. But is your operation really subject to these regimes? Maybe not or maybe only for part of them. This session will review how to assess if your organization is subject to them. We will also cover how to address customer requirements when you feel you are not subject to these regimes.\n\nQuick, the Auditors are Here. Where is the Vendor Contract and What's in it?\n\nKerstin Bagus, NetForce Global LLC; Kevin Coy, Arnall Golden Gregory LLP; Mark Sward, Sterling\n\nVendor Management is more than a purchasing function. Certain contractual language may be required (GDPR, Privacy Shield). Specific compliance requirements may be required (CCPA). A level of accountability to clients, internal management, and regulators must be met. If a data breach occurs, or information is misused, you may be on the hook even if you did not know about it. Any company using vendors may need to adhere to these requirements. This session reviews critical contractual and accountability requirements.\n\nLegal/Compliance Track\n\n*Five Key Lessons for Defending FCRA Class Action Lawsuits\n\nDavid Anthony, Troutman Sanders LLP; Timothy St. George, Troutman Sanders, LLP; Cindy Hanson Troutman Sanders LLP\n\nCompanies in the background screening industry face legal risks under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”).

It imposes many new obligations on companies that process the data of California consumers, and grants those consumers a number of new rights. While FCRA-regulated activities are exempt, many CRAs may still find themselves caught by the CCPA for other services they sell, not to mention their own marketing and HR activities. This session provides an overview of the CCPA, the obligations it imposes, and what a CRA should consider for compliance.\n\n*FCRA Basics for Screeners - Distance Learning Style\n\nBecki Kuehn, Hudson Cook; Cierra Newman, Hudson Cook\n\nNew to screening or need a refresher on FCRA basics?

How do you select third parties to help in the distribution of your products? Do you REALLY know how they manage things like Business Continuity, Data Security, and Compliance with State and Federal Laws?

This session will cover effective vendor management, why we need it, how to perform it and who should support it. Topics will include risk assessment, due diligence,termination strategies and more.\n\n*COVID-19, Remote Employees and the Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape\n\nMontserrat Miller, Arnall Golden Gregory LLP; Kevin Coy, Arnall Golden Gregory LLP; Kristin Adams, Aon; CJ Dietzman, Aon\n\nCOVID-19 has turned our workplaces upside down and companies of all sizes are adjusting to the new \"normal\" of remote employees.
