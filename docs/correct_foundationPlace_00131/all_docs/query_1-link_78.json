        "text": "308\n\nYesterday Fairfax Water hosted the spring ASUG Virginia Chapter meeting in Northern Virginia. On this day, we experienced a deluge of much-needed rain, 2-3 inches. Despite this, turnout was higher than last year.\n\nBefore starting, we checked some of the computers; unfortunately later in the day this computer \"died\". It was a brand new computer; some things you can't predict.\n\nAbove is some of the ASUG \"swag\" and some Fairfax Water bottles that attendees took home.\n\nThis was my first time ordering food for a chapter meeting; it is quite tricky as the order needs to be placed 1 week ahead of time; how can you predict registration one week out? Turns out I only over-ordered by 8 people, (more definitely registered than showed up).\n\nOf course we thank our sponsors, one of which was Clear Software.\n\nIntelliCorp is always a great ASUG sponsor.\n\nThis is the first time Centrify was a sponsor for the chapter.\n\nERP Integrated Solutions was another sponsor.\n\nAncile Solutions was another sponsor.\n\nSource: Clear Software\n\nClear Software presented their customer success story of 52 screens eliminated and a 700% increase in productivity. Unfortunately some technical issues (computer dying) prevented the WebEx connection and demo. The slides did tell a compelling story.\n\nSource: Centrify\n\nCentrify covered why you want to secure your SAP system.\n\nSource: Ancile\n\nTed Motley, Ancile, covered how their solutions help make the right content available at the right time. I use the Ancile simulations a great deal myself. Sometimes for training, and sometimes to remind myself how I did things.\n\nSource: Raytheon\n\nTim Byrd, Raytheon and SAP Customer, discussed how their performance management team to improve system performance.\n\nSource: SAP (roadmaps are subject to change)\n\nLastly, SAP covered the 4 year S/4HANA Public Sector roadmap. Since we use Funds Management, it was interesting to learn as of 1610 table FMIFIIT (\"formy-fit\") stays, but may go away in the future. We also use the Multichannel Foundation for Utilities.\n\nI want to thank Fairfax Water for hosting, the speakers for presenting, the sponsors for sponsoring and the attendees who made it to Fairfax Water while we experienced a flash flood warning. The road I usually take home was closed.\n\nJoin us for our next meeting, October 27, in Richmond, Virginia. Altria will be our hosts.\n\nSAP Managed Tags:\n\nPublic Sector"
