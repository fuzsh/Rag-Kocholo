        "text": "Clean Slate Update: Best Practices for 2024\n\nClean Slate laws strive to give individuals with criminal records a fresh start by automatically...\n\nClean Slate laws strive to give individuals with criminal records a fresh start by automatically sealing certain eligible records. The intent behind them is to improve an applicant’s chances of gaining employment, housing, and other opportunities without the burden of their past impacting their future. The Clean Slate Initiative reports that since 2018, twelve states have passed Clean Slate regulations. These states include Pennsylvania, Utah, New Jersey, Michigan, Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, Oklahoma, Colorado, California, Minnesota, and New York. Each state’s legislation varies in scope and specific provisions. Ready to work with a background screening provider who can help you navigate through Clean Slate and other laws that have an impact on background screening? Schedule time to Speak with Our Team and get started today. Clean Slate laws can be challenging for employers in the recruitment and hiring processes, including background screening. One of the primary concerns for employers regarding these laws is ensuring workplace safety without knowing much, if anything, about the applicant’s past criminal behavior. Additionally, at times, it is difficult to understand if the applicant is even suitable for the position at hand. For employers, it is a constant balancing act between the societal goal of offering second chances and ensuring workplace safety and suitability. Clean Slate Components for Employers to Understand While the specific requirements of Clean Slate laws vary by jurisdiction, they generally encompass several key components to further their goal of helping the reintegration of individuals with criminal records. And it’s important for employers to understand these various components, including: Automatic Expungement or Sealing: In many cases, certain low-level offenses, such as misdemeanors, are automatically expunged or sealed from an individual’s criminal record after a certain amount of time without any further offenses. Petition-Based Expungement: For higher-level or other offenses not eligible for automatic expungement, individuals can petition the court to have their records expunged or sealed. This typically requires demonstrating rehabilitation or meeting specific eligibility criteria, such as completing a rehabilitation program, maintaining a clean record for a certain period, or fulfilling other court-mandated conditions. Limited Disclosure: Once a record is expunged or sealed under Clean Slate laws, employers are often prohibited from considering these past offenses during the hiring process, even if they learn about them. Additionally, these records are generally inaccessible through standard background checks. Non-Discrimination Provisions: Many Clean Slate laws include clauses that prohibit employers from discriminating against applicants or employees based on their expunged or sealed criminal records. Employer Best Practices for Clean Slate Laws While the second quarter of 2024 has been relatively quiet in terms of states passing new Clean Slate laws, this is a good time to remind New York employers that the state’s Clean Slate Law will become effective later this year on November 16, 2024. As of that date, the conviction records of individuals convicted of certain state crimes will be sealed from public access once those individuals have completed their sentences and maintained law-abiding behavior for a specified period. Mid-year is also a good time to recap some best practices for employers regarding Clean Slate laws. Employers have had to, and continue to have to, review and adjust their background screening policies to ensure compliance with these laws, while maintaining effective risk management practices. These adjustments have led to some commonly used best practices that all employers may want to consider: Stay Informed and Educate Hiring Managers. This may seem intuitive, but keeping up to date with the Clean Slate laws in the jurisdictions where your organization operates is crucial for compliance efforts. Consult legal counsel or your background screening provider for guidance on how to interpret and implement these laws effectively into your policies. Train hiring managers and relevant personnel in the implications of Clean Slate laws and the importance of fair and equitable hiring practices. Emphasize both the legal obligations and the ethical considerations involved in using criminal background information during the hiring process. Revise Screening Criteria. Once you have knowledge about the Clean Slate laws that impact your organization and have trained others on it, it’s important to use what you learned. Use the information to review and update your background screening criteria to account for the limitations imposed by Clean Slate laws. Adjust your policies to exclude consideration of expunged or sealed offenses that are no longer relevant to job performance or that pose minimal risk. Add Other Searches to Background Screening. Consider a more comprehensive approach to background checks to fill in the gaps and onboard the best-suited applicants while safeguarding the company’s interests. You may want to consider adding Social Media Checks, News and Publications, Employment Verifications, and Professional References to gain a more complete understanding of the applicants who want to come work for you. Verifications, in particular, help ensure the accuracy of information provided on resumes or job applications and reduce the likelihood of hiring applicants who are dishonest. Implement a Separate Compliance Policy. Implement strong compliance procedures to help ensure adherence to Clean Slate laws and other relevant regulations governing background screening and employment practices. Document all steps taken to demonstrate good faith efforts toward compliance, which can help protect the organization in the event of audits or legal challenges. Partner with a Reputable Background Screener. Work with experienced, PBSA-accredited background screening vendors who understand the intricacies of Clean Slate laws. These vendors should be capable of updating their systems and procedures to ensure that expunged or sealed offenses are not improperly disclosed during the background check process. Additionally, they can offer guidance on managing the complexities of these laws and help employers make informed hiring decisions while staying compliant. By using these five best practices, employers can minimize their risk of noncompliance with relevant Clean Slate laws and maximize their background screening process.

With no comprehensive...\n\nData privacy has been a top priority for employers the past several years. With no comprehensive federal privacy law, states are deciding how to handle privacy matters themselves. While each of these laws have their own nuances and requirements, adding to the already complex patchwork of laws for employers to navigate, they essentially all require businesses to take reasonable steps to protect consumer data privacy, confidentiality, and integrity. Ready to create your own background screening package with a provider who can help you navigate through compliance? Get Started Now. The goal of these laws is to protect an individual’s privacy rights and ensure that their personal data is handled responsibly and securely. Data privacy laws often require organizations to obtain consent from individuals before collecting their personal information, implement measures to safeguard data against unauthorized access or disclosure, and provide individuals with rights to access, correct, or delete their personal data. With new privacy laws being enacted across the country on nearly a monthly basis, employers must stay diligent in their compliance efforts. To help, we’ve compiled the latest privacy laws for review. 2024 Data Privacy Laws The following states have enacted data privacy laws since January of 2024. New Jersey On January 16, 2024, the New Jersey Data Privacy Law was signed into law. Under the law, controllers (individuals or legal entities that determine the purpose and means of processing personal information) that conduct business in the state or produce products or services targeted to state residents and within the calendar year (i) control or process personal data of at least 100,000 New Jersey consumers or (ii) control or process personal data of 25,000 New Jersey consumers and derive revenue (or receive discounts) from the sale of personal data, must provide consumers with certain rights. Consumers (defined as New Jersey residents acting only in an individual or household context) may: confirm whether a controller accesses and processes their personal data; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; delete their personal data; obtain a copy of their personal data held by the controller in a readily usable format (i.e., data portability); and opt out of processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling. Among other obligations, the law requires controllers to provide consumers a “reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful” privacy notice that includes: the categories of personal data the controller processes; its purpose for processing the data; the categories of all third parties to which the controller may disclose the personal data; the categories of data the controller may disclose; information on how consumers may exercise their rights and appeal the controller’s decisions; the process by which the controller notifies consumers of material changes to their notice, along with the effective date of the notice; and an active email address or other online mechanism the consumer may use to contact the controller. New Jersey’s data privacy law will become effective January 15, 2025. New Hampshire On March 6, 2024, New Hampshire enacted the New Hampshire Privacy Act. Under the law, controllers (individuals or legal entities that determine the purpose and means of processing personal information) that conduct business in the state (or produce products or services targeted to state residents) and within a one-year time period (i) control or process personal data of at least 35,000 New Hampshire consumers or (ii) control or process personal data of 10,000 New Hampshire consumers and derive more than 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data, must provide consumers with certain rights. New Hampshire consumers (defined as New Hampshire residents acting only in a personal capacity) have the following rights under the new law: confirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and providing access to their data, unless providing confirmation and access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; delete their personal data; obtain a copy, in an accessible format, of their personal data processed by the controller (i.e., data portability); and opt out of the processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling. Among other obligations, New Hampshire’s law requires controllers to provide consumers a “reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful” privacy notice that includes the following: the categories of personal data it processes; its purpose for processing the data; the categories of third parties to which it may disclose the personal data and which categories of data it may disclose; information on how consumers may exercise their rights and appeal the controller’s decisions, and an active email address or other online mechanism for the consumer to directly contact the controller. New Hampshire’s data privacy law will become effective January 1, 2025. Kentucky On April 4, 2024, Kentucky enacted the Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Act (“Kentucky CDPA”). Under the law, controllers (individuals or legal entities that determine the purpose and means of processing personal information) who either conduct business in the Commonwealth of Kentucky or produce products or services targeted to residents of Kentucky and who, within the calendar year, either (i) control or process personal data of at least 100,000 Kentucky consumers or (ii) control or process personal data of 25,000 Kentucky consumers and derive over 50% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data, must provide consumers with certain rights. Kentucky consumers (defined as a Kentucky resident acting only in an individual context) have the following rights under the new law: confirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and access their data, unless providing confirmation and access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; delete their personal data; obtain a copy of the personal data previously provided to the controller in a readily useable format (i.e., data portability); and opt out of the processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling. Among other obligations, Kentucky’s law requires controllers to provide consumers a “reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful” privacy notice that includes the following: the categories of personal data it processes; its purpose for processing the data; the categories of third parties to which it may disclose the personal data and which categories of data it may disclose; information on how consumers may securely and reliably exercise their rights and appeal a controller’s decisions. Kentucky’s data privacy law will become effective January 1, 2026. Nebraska On April 17, 2024, Nebraska enacted the Nebraska Data Privacy Act, which imposes obligations on controllers—a person that conducts business in Nebraska or produces a product or service consumed by residents of Nebraska; processes or engages in the sale of personal data; and is not a small business as determined under the federal Small Business Act, except if such person engages in the sale of sensitive data without receiving prior consent from the consumer. Nebraska’s law is broader than many other states in that it does not contain a revenue threshold nor a minimum number of consumers whose personal data is processed or sold for it to apply (similar to Texas’s law). Nebraska consumers (defined as Nebraska residents acting only in an individual or household, and not in a commercial or employment, context) have the following rights under the new law: confirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and access the personal data; correct inaccuracies in their personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of their personal data; delete their personal data provided by or obtained about the consumers; obtain a copy of their personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and readily usable format (to the extent technically feasible)(i.e. data portability); and opt out of the processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling in furtherance of a decision that produces a legal or similarly significant effect concerning the consumer. Among other obligations, the law requires controllers to provide consumers a “reasonably accessible and clear” privacy notice that includes: the categories of personal data processed by the controller; its purpose for processing the personal data; information on how consumers may exercise their rights and appeal a controller’s decisions; the categories of all third parties to which it shares the personal data and which categories of data it shares; and a description of at least two methods the consumer may use to submit a request to exercise a consumer right. Similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, “sale” is broadly defined as the exchange of personal data for monetary or other valuable consideration by the controller to a third party. The law also imposes requirements on “processors”—a person who processes personal data on behalf of a controller. Nebraska’s data privacy law will become effective January 1, 2025. Maryland On May 9, 2024, Maryland enacted the Maryland Online Data Privacy Act. Under the comprehensive law, controllers (individuals or legal entities that, along or jointly with others, determine the purpose and means of processing personal information) that conduct business in the state or produce products or services targeted to state residents and within the calendar year (i) control or process personal data of at least 35,000 Maryland consumers or (ii) control or process personal data of 10,000 Maryland consumers and derive more than 20% of gross revenue (a lower threshold than most other states) from the sale of personal data, must provide consumers with certain rights. Maryland consumers (defined as Maryland residents acting only in a personal capacity) have the following rights under the new law: confirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and providing access to their data, unless providing confirmation and access would require the controller to reveal a trade secret; correct inaccuracies in their personal data; delete their personal data; obtain a copy, in an accessible format, of their personal data processed by the controller (i.e., data portability); and opt out of the processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling. Among other obligations, Maryland’s law requires controllers to provide consumers a “reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful” privacy notice that includes the following: the categories of personal data it processes, including sensitive data; the categories of personal data shared with third parties, including sensitive data; the purposes for processing the data; information on how consumers may exercise their rights and submit an appeal; an active email address or other online mechanism that allows the consumer to contact the controller; and a disclosure if the controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal for targeted advertising or profiling. Maryland’s data privacy law will become effective October 1, 2025. What Employers Can Do In this rapidly evolving data privacy environment, staying informed by proactively monitoring legislative changes is key for employers. A comprehensive strategy may include: Conducting regular audits of consumer data usage. Staying updated on new or amended laws in relevant jurisdictions. Maintaining a compliance checklist to ensure alignment with privacy requirements across all states in which business is conducted. While using these and other strategies is helpful, as always, employers should consult legal counsel and a PBSA-accredited background screening partner about compliance matters. Why Orange Tree?

Whether they utilize body...\n\nIt’s no secret that more employers are using AI in the hiring process. Whether they utilize body language analysis, gamified tests, CV scanners, or some combination of them all, employers want to automate and streamline the process of finding and hiring the best talent. Regardless of the method or methods chosen, job applicants generally reply to the prompts and then AI, not a human resource manager or any other human being at all, decides if they’re moving forward in the hiring process or going home. And while the efficiency it brings is a welcome relief to busy employers, the lack of human oversight in the process increases the risk that contrary to employers’ intent, they are actually missing out on top talent due to inherent biases built into AI. Ready to work with a background screening provider who can help you navigate through the complexities of AI in the talent acquisition lifecycle? Schedule time to Speak with Our Team and get started today. Increased Use and Risks of AI in Hiring As discussed above, HR and resourcing teams have been quick to adopt AI and automation tools as a way of speeding up the management of large numbers of applications. But how many are actually using AI in the process? According to a study conducted by IBM late last year of 8,500 global IT professionals, 42% of companies were using AI screening “to improve recruiting and human resources,” while another 40% were actively considering it. If those considering it move from thought to action, that would mean over three quarters of IT employers would be using AI in some form in the recruiting process. With that kind of vast utilization, the impacts, both positive and negative, are far-reaching. SHRM recently noted, “As useful as such tools can be, they also pose novel risks in terms of the potential for bias, discrimination and digital exclusion (the latter being where candidates lack the requisite knowledge of, or access to, technology).” And employees are now living this reality. A February 2024 report from Rutgers University’s Heldrich Center for Workforce Development noted that 71% of workers are concerned about the impact of AI on jobs and just as many are worried about employers using the tech in hiring and promotion decisions. Are Employers Losing Top Talent Before They Get in the Door? While there has been much public concern about AI taking jobs away from humans, there are other risks, especially as it relates to an employer’s hiring practices. Many leaders anticipated that AI recruitment technology would eliminate biases in hiring practices. Yet, contrary to these expectations, there are instances where the opposite appears to be happening. There are many instances that are now suggesting that these tools are mistakenly filtering out highly qualified job applicants, increasing concerns that the software might be inadvertently eliminating top candidates. As noted in a BBC article, Hilke Schellman, widely cited author of Algorithm: How AI Can Hijack Your Career and Steal Your Future believes that the largest risk AI poses is not, in fact, machines taking employees’ positions, but rather prospective employees not getting roles in the first place. Just like the positive impacts can reach further, faster, so too can the negative ones. “One biased human hiring manager can harm a lot of people in a year, and that's not great. But an algorithm that is maybe used in all incoming applications at a large company… that could harm hundreds of thousands of applicants.” Neglecting to address these risks could result in AI tools inadvertently undermining an employer’s goals—excluding, rather than attracting the most qualified candidates even before their CV, resume, or application reaches a human’s desk. Three Ways to Secure Top Talent As employers continue to weigh the pros of automation and efficiency with the cons of potential bias that can exclude qualified applicants, they can take proactive steps to minimize risks and promote fairness in their organization’s hiring practices. Here are three strategies to help ensure the top talent isn’t walking out your door (before they even enter): 1. Increase Human Oversight with Accountability and Transparency. Establish clear guidelines and protocols for addressing instances of bias or discrimination and hold hiring managers and personnel accountable for their decisions and actions during the recruitment process. This will help support a culture of transparency where employees feel comfortable reporting concerns or raising questions about what is happening in the hiring process. 2. Proactively Audit for Bias. Conduct regular audits of the hiring process to assess its effectiveness and identify any areas where bias may be present. Solicit feedback from candidates and hiring managers to gain insights into their experiences and perceptions and use it to make improvements and adjustments as necessary. This may involve using diverse and representative datasets, as well as blind recruitment measures (removing all identifying information) during model training. 3. Data Tracking and Analysis. Collect data at each stage of the hiring process to monitor for any patterns of bias. Analyze metrics such as candidate demographics, interview outcomes, and hiring decisions to identify potential areas of concern. Use this data to make informed decisions and implement corrective measures as needed.

Whether it’s a slight exaggeration, a harmless fib, or a straight-out lie about academic credentials or nonexistent job roles, this is nothing new. But it seems to be growing more prevalent today, particularly as the interview process involves less face-to-face interaction—making it appear somewhat easier to get away with it. Ready to work with a background screening provider who can help you with verifications? Speak with our team to get started today. According to a recent StandOutCV survey, Google searches for advice relating to lying on resumes rose by 19% at the end of 2023 compared to 2022. On average, the same study found that 64.2% of Americans have lied about their personal details, skills, experience, or references on their resumes at least once. This could mean that an estimated 107 million Americans have lied on their resume to get a job. Key findings of the survey also include: Men are more likely to lie on a resume with 65.6% of men admitting to lying, compared to 63.3% of women. Younger people are more likely to lie on a resume than older people, 80.4% of 18-25-year-olds said they had lied, compared to 46.9% of those aged 65+. 1 in 4 (25.4%) have lied about their employer references, and 9 in 50 (18.5%) of this group have used fake job reference services, costing an average of $128.60 per reference, which can involve fake employers and paid actors. Almost 3 in 10 (29.6%) have lied about their college degree on their resume, more than half (54%) of those people told employers they had a degree when they didn’t. This research found that fake college degree certificates and transcripts can be bought online and cost an average of $197.83. Almost 1 in 5 (18.6%) say they haven’t been caught regarding their job application lies. Nearly three-quarters of people (73.4%) said they would consider using AI tools in 2024 to help embellish or lie on their resume. What does this all mean? For employers, it means you need to make sure you are getting as many facts as possible to make well-informed hiring decisions. What you don’t need is fiction when it comes to knowing who you are about to bring into your organization. Essentially, the more lies you do not uncover, the more at risk you are for potential theft; damage to employee, vendor, and customer relationships; workplace violence; and litigation for negligent hiring—a reality for many employers. These risks can be minimized significantly if you take the necessary steps to help ensure a safe work environment. Background screenings, and specifically Verifications, such as employment, education, and references, among others, provide an important component both in reducing risks and in the defense against negligent hiring claims. Three Areas Verifications Can Help Uncover the Truth Verifications serve as a vital tool for employers to ensure the accuracy of information provided by applicants on their resumes or job applications. They not only assist employers in avoiding hiring individuals who have been less than truthful from the outset but also provide valuable insights into their character, skills, and background. Verifications help to address any gaps or discrepancies in employment or education history—although it’s important to note that not every gap or discrepancy signals dishonesty. Legitimate reasons, such as extended leaves for family reasons or educational interruptions, may contribute to such gaps and may have simply been overlooked in creating their resume. Without verifications though, there is no way to tell the difference. Here are three areas that the study showed increased levels of untruthfulness—where verifications can be particularly helpful: 1. Employment. The three most common things people had lied about on their resumes had to do with their prior employment, including their salary at previous jobs (32.8%), their skills (30.8%), and their previous work experience (30.5%). Employment Verifications confirm that the applicant’s employment history accurately represents their work experience, job titles, responsibilities, and employment dates. By cross-referencing the applicant’s claims with employment records, you can identify any discrepancies or inaccuracies in their work history. 2. Education. Of the 29.6% who had lied about their college degree, more than half (54%) said they had lied about being a college graduate on their resume when applying for a job. Educational Verifications verify credentials listed by the applicant to help employers avoid this situation. By comparing the information provided by the applicant with official school records, you can ensure that the applicant’s educational claims are truthful. 3. References. 25.4% of job applicants said they had lied specifically about the references on their resume. Reference checks offer valuable insights into their professional performance, character, and suitability for the position. Discrepancies between the information provided by references and the applicant’s claims often raise red flags. By implementing thorough Verification processes, you gain a comprehensive understanding of your applicant’s background, qualifications, and suitability for the role to make more informed hiring decisions and maintain the integrity of your recruitment process. You also mitigate the risk of hiring unqualified or dishonest applicants, maintain the integrity of your hiring practices, and safeguard your organization’s reputation and success. To do so, it’s important to work with a trusted, PBSA-accredited background screening provider, such as Orange Tree, to ensure that Verifications are conducted responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection.

To that end, a continuous stream of...\n\nWe are undoubtedly living in a time of instant gratification. To that end, a continuous stream of new technology is available to speed processes up and make them more accessible and convenient for all involved. This ease of information is what today’s job applicants are not only accustomed to, but also expect regarding background checks, interviews, and onboarding. At the same time, a significant shift in the mindsets of job applicants and employees has occurred. They have higher expectations for their workplaces, starting from the recruiting process and including background screening. They may expect a fast process, mobile availability, customization, and technology-driven solutions, but they also expect some fundamental principles underlying them all; namely, transparency, privacy, expediency, and to be treated with respect. Ready to work with a background screening provider who can help you elevate your job applicant experience? Speak with our team to get started today. Information, convenience, and accessibility are what applicants and employees are expecting … and what employers must provide. They want to work for employers that value them and their time throughout the hiring process and long after. To them, those initial stages are what set the bar for the company’s culture and work environment. For employers, the key is making the background check process, as well as the entire hiring and onboarding processes critical components of the overall applicant/employee experience to meet those expectations from the outset. Five Steps Employers Can Take to Enhance the Applicant Experience These increased expectations of applicants should not be viewed as a challenge, but rather, as an opportunity. To provide the best background screening experience to job applicants, employers can take several proactive steps to help ensure transparency, efficiency, and respect throughout the process. Here are the top five steps you can take today to enhance the applicant experience and help ensure expectations are being met and exceeded: 1. Communicate Clearly Provide applicants with clear information about the background screening process at the outset of the hiring process. Explain what types of checks will be conducted, how long it typically takes, and what information will be collected. Then, provide clear updates throughout the entire process. Keeping applicants informed about the status of their background check and any additional information or documentation that may be required will go a long way. This can be done through proactive updates and timely responses to their inquiries. How to Maintain Clear Communication Utilize an Applicant Portal: Implementing an online applicant portal allows candidates to track the status of their background check and any pending actions on their part. This portal can be updated in real-time, providing a transparent view into the process. Automated Email Updates: Set up an automated email system that notifies applicants at critical stages of the background screening process. For example, send a confirmation email once the screening is initiated, another when additional information is required, and finally, an email upon completion. Each email should be clear, concise, and informative. FAQ Section on Website: Create a detailed FAQ section on your company website dedicated to the hiring and background check process. Include answers to common questions, what applicants can expect, how to prepare, and steps they can take if they have concerns or problems. Ensure this section is easy to find and regularly updated with relevant information. 2. Maintain Compliance Conduct background checks in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Ensure that your background screening practices are fair, non-discriminatory, and consistent with best practices in the industry. Additionally, ensure you obtain explicit consent from applicants prior to initiating any background checks. Clearly explain what information will be gathered and how it will be used in the hiring decision. Ideas to Maintain Compliance Regularly Update Compliance Knowledge: Stay informed about changes in employment law and regulations related to background checks at the federal, state, and local levels. This may involve attending seminars, subscribing to legal updates, and consulting with legal experts to ensure your background screening practices remain in compliance. Periodic audits of your screening processes can also help identify and rectify any compliance gaps. Implement Consistent Background Screening Policies: Ensure that your background screening process is applied uniformly to all applicants to avoid discrimination. This includes conducting the same types of checks for all candidates applying for similar positions and evaluating the results of these checks according to pre-established criteria. Document these policies and criteria clearly, and train your HR team to apply them consistently to support fair hiring practices. 3. Respect Privacy Just as our online presence has drastically increased over the past several years, so have privacy concerns over that presence. Make sure to handle applicants’ personal information with care and respect their privacy throughout the background screening process. Safeguard sensitive information through secure management, so that it is only shared with individuals who have a legitimate need to know. Good Privacy Practices Transparent Data Usage Policies: Clearly communicate to applicants how their information will be used and who will have access to it. This involves providing a straightforward privacy policy that outlines the scope of data collection, storage, and sharing. Make sure applicants have easy access to this policy and understand their rights regarding their personal information. Regular Privacy Training for Staff: Provide ongoing training for all staff involved in the background screening process on the latest privacy laws, data protection strategies, and the importance of confidentiality. This ensures everyone understands how to handle sensitive applicant information properly. Minimize Data Collection: Only request and collect information that is absolutely necessary for the background check and relevant to the job application. Avoid collecting excessive personal details that do not contribute to the hiring decision. 4. Ensure Accuracy Take steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information gathered during the background screening process. Use reputable background screening vendors who have achieved accreditation with the Professional Background Screening Association (PBSA). Additionally, be sure to verify information from multiple sources to minimize the risk of errors or inaccuracies. Steps to Improve Accuracy Seek Applicant Clarification When Necessary: If discrepancies or unclear information arise during the background screening process, seek clarification from the applicant directly. This can help resolve misunderstandings or provide context to certain entries in the report. Regular Training for Screeners: Ensure that staff involved in the background screening process receive regular training on how to accurately collect, analyze, and report information. This training should include updates on legal compliance, data verification techniques, and ethical considerations. Employ the Services of Accredited Vendors: Choose background screening vendors that have been accredited by the Professional Background Screening Association (PBSA). Accredited vendors are evaluated against rigorous standards, ensuring that their processes and products meet high levels of accuracy and professionalism. These vendors are more likely to provide accurate and reliable background screening services. 5. Be Transparent about Results If adverse information is uncovered during the background check, be transparent with the applicant about the findings and give them an opportunity to provide context or explanation. Follow all legal requirements for providing applicants with a copy of their background check report and informing them of their rights under the FCRA and other applicable laws. Improving Transparency Pre-Adverse Action Communications: When adverse information that could impact the hiring decision is found, initiate a pre-adverse action process by sending the applicant a notice. This notice should contain a copy of the background check report and a summary of the applicant's rights under the FCRA. Give applicants a reasonable amount of time to review the findings and respond before making any final employment decisions. Provide a Clear Explanation of Findings: Offer the applicant an opportunity to discuss the background check findings in detail. This involves setting up a meeting or a call where the applicant can provide context or correct any inaccuracies. Ensure that this process is handled with sensitivity and respect, recognizing that this conversation may be challenging for the applicant. Open Doors for Disputes or Corrections: Inform the applicant about the procedure for disputing inaccuracies in the background check report. Provide them with contact information for the background screening provider and guide them through the process of challenging or correcting any false or mistaken information. Ensuring applicants understand their rights to dispute and correct information promotes fairness and transparency in the hiring process. The Power of Supportive and Transparent Hiring Processes By implementing these practices, employers can demonstrate their commitment to providing a fair, respectful, and transparent background screening experience to job applicants, inherently building trust and goodwill into the relationship from the start. Throughout the entire process, it’s crucial to provide support to job applicants by being available to answer their questions and providing assistance as needed. You can also offer guidance on how applicants can address any discrepancies or issues that may arise during the screening process. Job applicants, just like current employees, want to feel as if they matter to their employers, and providing this support is one effective way of doing just that. For employers, this is an opportunity for a strong competitive advantage in a crowded marketplace. With a well-developed and expedient hiring process, including transparent and well-communicated background checks, employers can provide the experience applicants want. By making the hiring and onboarding processes essential components of the overall applicant/employee experience, employers will not only meet, but exceed those increased expectations.

Nearly all states have some form of law legalizing marijuana, each with their own nuances, despite the fact that it remains a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substance Act (making it illegal for any reason under federal law). Further, with more remote workers—many in states that differ from the employer’s state—the uncertainty regarding marijuana only rises. Determining how these laws impact employers’ drug-free workplace policies, accommodations for employees, and drug testing processes, including laws prohibiting such testing, continues to be an uphill battle, particularly with the patchwork of laws across the country rapidly increasing. In an effort to keep employers informed, we’ve compiled the latest marijuana headlines. Ready to create your own drug screening package with a provider who can help you navigate through compliance? Get Started Now. New Marijuana Legislation Impacting Employers California Two pieces of legislation, enacted in 2022 and 2023, and both effective as of January 1, 2024, have brought some recent changes to California’s employment landscape regarding the treatment of an employee’s or applicant’s use of marijuana. California Assembly Bill 2188 states that, other than certain exceptions, “it is unlawful for an employer to request information from an applicant for employment relating to the applicant’s prior use of cannabis.” California Senate Bill 700 takes another stance in stating that it is unlawful for employers “to discriminate against a person in hiring, termination, or any term or condition of employment, or otherwise penalizing a person, if the discrimination is based upon” off-duty marijuana use or drug tests that reveal non-psychoactive cannabis metabolites. Washington In Washington State, the newly effective marijuana law (effective January 1, 2024) is strikingly similar to California’s laws. The law protects workers from facing employment discrimination during the hiring process over their lawful use of cannabis. Specifically, employers are prohibited from making initial hiring decisions based on an applicant’s cannabis use outside of work, or due to a positive test or screening that detects non-psychoactive cannabis in hair, blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Other Notable Marijuana News Hawaii Two Hawaii legislative committees recently approved a bill to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. If passed, the law would go into effect on January 1, 2026. The legislation would allow adults aged 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana and up to five grams of cannabis concentrates. The law would also permit home cultivation of up to six marijuana plants and allow for the possession of up to 10 ounces of harvested homegrown cannabis. Florida Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) recently commented that a marijuana legalization initiative will be on the state’s November ballot as a proposed constitutional amendment. This isn’t the first time this has been attempted in Florida, and the state’s attorney general continues to seek to block the vote. However, if it makes it to the statewide ballot and voters pass the amendment, anyone 21 years old and older would be able to use and possess up to three ounces of marijuana (with not more than five grams in a concentrated form), with certain restrictions. Under the proposed amendment, marijuana could be sold through dispensaries without the need for a medical marijuana card. Background on the Marijuana Landscape Employers have long since grappled with the effects of marijuana use by their employees, especially concerning workplace accidents. Over recent years, research has shown an increased likelihood of errors and impaired judgment leading to accidents when individuals are under the influence of marijuana. This can be especially dangerous in positions involving safety. As such, a National Safety Council white paper recommends a zero-tolerance policy for marijuana in safety-sensitive positions. Similarly, OSHA advocates for post-accident drug testing as a “legitimate part of a root cause analysis to determine the cause of an accident.” Once again, the inconsistencies between states’ laws and between state and federal policy renders the entire situation foggy, at best. Employers face more than just concerns about accidents related to employees’ marijuana use, though. Employee marijuana use could also easily harm a company’s reputation, raise absenteeism rates, jeopardize safety, or result in costly errors, leading to decreased productivity and profitability. Additionally, navigating internal policies regarding marijuana use poses its own unique challenges, including defining permissible behavior, outlining prohibitions, and interpreting positive test results accurately. Complicating matters further is a lack of scientifically validated drug tests for marijuana. Simply, marijuana staying in a person’s system far longer than alcohol makes it extremely difficult to determine impairment during accidents or testing. What Can Employers Do About Marijuana in the Workplace? Similar to other laws that impact employers, their policies and procedures, and decisions, the patchwork of marijuana laws demands compliance and continuous attention. As the uncertainty surrounding marijuana use in the workplace persists, employers must maintain vigilance. Unfortunately, there is no definitive guidance available, regardless of the employer’s location. Furthermore, with the significant increase in remote employees, employers must stay informed about legal developments in other states. To mitigate risks, employers may want to consider the following strategies: Stay updated on laws across various jurisdictions where they do business. Establish a clear, written drug-free workplace policy with which all employees are familiar (and sign off on). Revise the policy as necessary in response to new legislation that impacts the location(s) in which the company operates. Conduct regular safety meetings to reinforce policies and address concerns. Provide continuing education on the potential risks of impairment to both managers and staff. Train managers regularly to recognize signs of impairment and guide appropriate actions in such situations.

What’s permissible in one state may not be so in another, creating an intricate web of rules, requirements, and nuances. These include differences in how employers should be defining past compensation, accessing criminal records, and handling personal identifying information. With varying laws and regulations, staying compliant requires meticulous attention to detail and adaptability. To that end, we are compiling the most impactful laws for employers on a quarterly basis. Ready to create your own background screening package with a provider who can help you navigate through compliance? Get Started Now. States hit the ground running in the first quarter of 2024. Newly enacted laws impacting employers include pay transparency, clean slate, and data privacy among various states. Pay Transparency Pay transparency laws have gained momentum recently as salary history laws of years past evolved and broadened. These laws require employers to disclose information about employee compensation, including salaries, wages, bonuses, and other forms of compensation, with the goal of promoting fairness and equity in the workplace. Some laws require employers to provide salary ranges for job openings, while others require disclosure of pay scales within the organization, and still others prohibit retaliation against employees who discuss their compensation with coworkers. Some encompass all three, as well as other requirements. Washington, D.C. On January 12, 2024, the Wage Transparency Omnibus Amendment Act was signed into law, requiring private employers of any size to disclose the minimum and maximum projected salary or hourly wage for a position in all job postings and advertisements. Further, D.C. employers also must include this range in any internal job postings of the position. Beyond job postings, the law requires employers to disclose the existence of other benefits, including healthcare and bonuses, to prospective employees before the first interview, and prohibits employers from screening job applicants based on wage history. Employers will be required to post a notice in the workplace (in a conspicuous place in at least one location where employees congregate) notifying employees of their rights under the law. The effective date of June 30, 2024 is fast approaching. Federal The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (“FAR Council”) recently proposed a new rule similar to a pay transparency law and, as such, worth noting here. The proposed rule imposes certain requirements for contractor job advertisements involving work that is “on or in connection with” a government contract. All advertisements for job openings must disclose the salary or wages (or range) that the contractor believes in good faith it will pay for the advertised position. It must also include a general description of the job benefits and other compensation types offered. Further, if 50% or more of the expected compensation is attributable to commissions, bonuses, and/or overtime pay, the contractor must indicate the dollar amount or percentage of overall compensation (or ranges thereof) for each type. The new FAR clause would also prohibit contractors from seeking or using an applicant’s compensation history as part of the hiring process for work “on or in connection with” a government contract. Contractors may submit comments on the proposed rule through April 1, 2024. Clean Slate Clean slate laws, designed to help individuals with criminal records obtain a fresh start by automatically sealing or expunging certain past convictions from their records, have also increased drastically. These laws typically apply to minor offenses or non-violent crimes, with the goal of removing barriers to employment, housing, and other opportunities. Although the details vary by jurisdiction, clean slate laws often involve an automated process for clearing eligible convictions after a certain period has passed without further criminal activity. While they are a part of broader efforts to promote reintegration and reduce recidivism among individuals with criminal histories, they often present a challenge for employers who are unable to gather information about those whom they are considering hiring. Maryland The Maryland Clean Slate Act of 2024 was recently proposed, setting forth a simplified expungement process for clearing criminal records. The law expands the eligibility criteria of the state’s previously enacted clean slate act, while establishing a system for automatically expunging certain offenses after specified timeframes if the person does not engage in additional criminal activity. The goal of this simplification is to reduce the need for individuals to file petitions for expungement. For example, non-domestically related misdemeanors would automatically be expunged seven years after disposition, while non-domestically related felonies would be after 20 or more years. The law would also expunge certain lesser offenses after three years. In Maryland, 410,000 people would be eligible to have their record fully cleared under this amendment. If enacted, this law would become effective January 1, 2027. Data Privacy Data privacy laws governing the collection, use, storage, and sharing of personal information by organizations have also increased considerably over the past couple of years. The goal of these laws is to protect an individual’s privacy rights and ensure that their personal data is handled responsibly and securely. Data privacy laws often require organizations to obtain consent from individuals before collecting their personal information, implement measures to safeguard data against unauthorized access or disclosure, and provide individuals with rights to access, correct, or delete their personal data. New Jersey On January 16, 2024, the New Jersey Data Privacy Law was signed into law, making New Jersey the first state this year and the thirteenth state overall to adopt comprehensive data privacy legislation. Under the law, “controllers” (individuals or legal entities that determine the purpose and means of processing personal information) that conduct business in the state (or produce products or services targeted to state residents) and within the calendar year (i) control or process personal data of at least 100,000 New Jersey consumers or (ii) control or process personal data of 25,000 New Jersey consumers and derive revenue (or receive discounts) from the sale of personal data, must provide consumers with certain rights. Consumers, defined as “New Jersey residents acting only in an individual or household context,” may (i) confirm whether a controller accesses and processes their personal data; (ii) correct inaccuracies in their personal data; (iii) delete their personal data; (iv) obtain a copy of their personal data held by the controller in a readily usable format (i.e., data portability); and (v) opt out of processing of their personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of their personal data, or profiling. The law requires controllers to provide consumers a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes: the categories of personal data the controller processes; its purpose for processing the data; the categories of all third parties to which the controller may disclose the personal data; the categories of data the controller may disclose; information on how consumers may exercise their rights and appeal the controller’s decisions; the process by which the controller notifies consumers of material changes to their notice, along with the effective date of the notice; and an active email address or other online mechanism the consumer may use to contact the controller. New Jersey’s data privacy law will become effective January 15, 2025. What Employers Can Do Compliance demands continuous vigilance. In a rapidly evolving regulatory environment, staying informed by proactively monitoring legislative changes is key for employers. As such, employers should consider developing a comprehensive strategy, including: Regular audits of hiring practices, covering application and interview criminal-related questions, job position salary ranges, and consumer data usage. Stay updated on new or amended laws in relevant jurisdictions. Maintain a compliance checklist to ensure alignment with legal requirements. Employing these strategies facilitates an efficient and risk-averse navigation of regulatory complexities.

As they navigate the already intricate patchwork of federal, state, city, and county legislation, various new laws and regulations continue to be passed across the country. Traditionally, the complexity surrounding this patchwork landscape stemmed from criminal justice reforms and marijuana legalization. But now, it continues to evolve with the emergence of laws surrounding comprehensive data privacy, clean slate, pay transparency, and AI restrictions, among others. The growing set of standards only further complicates compliance efforts for employers, especially those operating across state borders. Many are left concerned about the consequences of noncompliance and specifically the enforcement actions taken by states. Ready to create your own background screening package with a provider who can help you navigate through HR compliance? Get Started Now. Non-Compliance Enforcement Actions Employers are justifiably concerned. Several jurisdictions have appointed agencies dedicated to enforcing these emerging laws. This is not necessarily a new phenomenon, but it is increasing. For example, back in 2019, Washington, D.C. enforced its Ban the Box law to the tune of $500,000 and more than 1,100 administrative charges filed against employers who were continuing to ask about criminal histories on job applications. Regarding the violations, a vast majority of them (more than 90%) were related to criminal background questions that appeared on job applications, while less than 5% were related to questions an employer asked in an interview. Since then, there are more laws, more lawsuits, more civil penalties, and more scrutiny, including from the federal government. Federal Communications Commission Partners with States for Data Protection In December of 2023, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a first of its kind partnership with four states to collaborate on enforcement actions related to consumers’ privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. In this joint task force, the attorneys general of Connecticut, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania have pledged to share their expertise, resources, and coordinate efforts to conduct investigations for the protection of consumers. In consideration for their efforts, the FCC has offered partner states not only the expertise of its enforcement staff but also important resources and remedies to support their investigations. State Enforcement Headlines of Interest The California Civil Rights Department recently filed a lawsuit against a grocery chain, Ralph’s Grocery Company, for alleged violations of California’s Fair Chance Act. Enacted in 2018, the Fair Chance Act prohibits employers from inquiring about conviction history before a conditional job offer and limits disqualifying convictions to those directly related to job responsibilities. The California Civil Rights Department (CRD) enforces the Act to combat discrimination and enhance public safety, reflecting California’s commitment to fair employment practices. In the lawsuit, the CRD claims that the employer denied employment opportunities to applicants with criminal histories. It goes further in alleging that the company unlawfully screened out qualified candidates based on irrelevant criminal backgrounds. The Department is seeking monetary damages for the workers who were denied jobs or lost jobs as a result of the grocery chain’s screening practices, as well as a court order to require it to come into compliance with the Fair Chance Act. New Jersey Issues Violations under Fair Chance Housing Act Fair Chance Acts also often apply to housing, as many are now aware in New Jersey, where the state issued 30 notices of violation to housing providers in 2022. The state alleged violations of its Fair Chance Housing Act (“Act”), which prohibits landlords from asking about an applicant’s criminal history on an application or in an interview prior to making the applicant a conditional offer of housing. It also prohibits them from stating in any housing advertisements that they will not consider applicants with a criminal record. The violations were centered on allegations that the housing providers asked prohibited questions on housing applications, posted housing advertisements, and maintained policies that did not comply with the law. Recipients of violation notices faced civil penalties of up to $1,000 for a first offense, up to $5,000 for a second offense, and up to $10,000 for any subsequent offense. Colorado Enforces Wage Transparency Law Colorado’s Wage Transparency Law is considered one of the most aggressive to date because of the requirement to post salaries publicly. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) has similarly demonstrated that enforcement may also be more aggressive. While the CDLE had been more lenient regarding enforcement in the past, when the law was still relatively new, it has since notified more than 200 companies regarding violations and issued fines for noncompliance. It sent over 125 Compliance Assistance Letters for remote jobs and over 120 Opportunity to Cure Letters (giving employers an opportunity to cure violations) in response to complaints of violations and fined multiple employers. The extent of the violations varies from listings that shared no wages at all to others that had no maximum amount (only a “+” sign, such as “Salary Range: $50,000 – 75,000+”) to others that offered “full benefits” without a description of those benefits. How to Stay Compliant as an Employer The examples above are only a select few that illustrate the steadfast commitment of states to enforcing these compliance laws. In a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, staying informed isn’t just beneficial; it’s essential. Proactively monitoring and understanding legislative shifts is key to maintaining compliance and mitigating risks in this ever-changing environment. Employers should consider developing a comprehensive HR compliance strategy that, at a minimum, includes: A process for a regular (at minimum quarterly) review and audit of the organization’s hiring practices, including, but not limited to: (a) application questions; (b) interview questions; (c) salary ranges posted in job positions; (d) how consumer data is being used, and; (e) written HR policies regarding hiring. A system for the review of any new or amended laws in the jurisdictions in which business is conducted. An HR compliance assurance checklist to ensure hiring practices are in alignment with these laws’ requirements. A provision to consult a background screening partner or legal counsel on all compliance matters. In a landscape of uncertainty, one thing appears certain, states are taking enforcement of these laws very seriously. Compliance is an ongoing endeavor that requires continuous monitoring. While this prospect may seem daunting for employers, using the above strategies will help provide a more efficient and risk-adverse navigation of it all. Why Orange Tree Employment Screening?

Associated with campaigns by civil rights groups and fair chance advocates to remove certain criminal records from public view, the objective of Clean Slate laws are to provide individuals with a ‘clean slate’ following the completion of their criminal sentences. Clean Slate laws have swept across the country with increasing frequency over the past several years, driven by organizations such as The Clean Slate Initiative. These laws operate under the principle that prior criminal convictions can slow societal reintegration, especially as it relates to employment and housing. In many states, Clean Slate laws require the automatic clearing of records for specific low-level offenses, while others require a petition to the court to do so. While the intention behind Clean Slate laws is undeniably important, employers often have concerns regarding the implications of this type of legislation on their ability to make informed hiring decisions. These laws, along with others that restrict access to certain information, such as salary history and marijuana laws, raise legitimate questions about how employers can effectively evaluate job applicants and ensure they are making sensible hiring choices. With limited access to certain background information, employers face uncertainty about the suitability of job applicants and the safety of the workplace, with the threat of potential negligent hiring claims as a backdrop. Policy aside, though, the rate at which Clean Slate laws are being passed is also leaving employers increasingly concerned about compliance regarding their hiring practices.

Clean Slate Law Updates In an effort to ease compliance concerns, we’ve compiled the latest updates on Clean Slate laws: Connecticut Clean Slate Law As of January of 2024, the state of Connecticut started automatically expunging more than 80,000 criminal records. While the CT Clean Slate Law passed in 2021, it underwent significant delays due to required technology upgrades. Now, the state isn’t wasting any time in clearing the criminal records of individuals after a certain amount of time has passed, including: Seven years after a misdemeanor conviction. Ten years after certain low-level felony convictions, provided there are no subsequent convictions during this period. This is in addition to the 40,000-plus low-level convictions involving cannabis in 2023 under the Connecticut cannabis law. Pennsylvania Expands their Clean Slate Law In 2018, Pennsylvania became the first state to pass a Clean Slate law, automatically sealing the records of lower-level non-violent offenses for those without a criminal conviction within the past 10 years. Pennsylvania expanded that legislation once in 2020 and recently expanded it again. Pennsylvania’s recent legislation allows for more criminal records to be sealed. The PA Clean Slate law now: Permits courts to seal criminal records related to non-violent drug felonies with a minimum sentence of under two and a half years and/or a maximum sentence of under five years. Enables the sealing of specific non-violent felonies for individuals with a clean record for ten years. Shortens the waiting period for the automatic sealing of misdemeanor offenses to seven years instead of ten. 2024 New York Clean Slate Law The state of New York recently passed its own Clean Slate law, going into effect later this year on November 16, 2024. As of that date, the criminal conviction records of individuals convicted of certain state crimes will be sealed from public access once those individuals have completed their sentences and maintained law-abiding behavior for a specified period of time. Specifically, convictions under the NY Clean Slate Act include: Misdemeanors when at least three years have passed since the individual’s release from incarceration or the imposition of sentence (if there was no incarceration). Felonies when at least eight years have passed from the date the individual was last released from incarceration, as long as the individual: does not have a criminal charge pending; and is not currently under the supervision of any probation or parole department. Convictions involving Class A felonies (where a maximum life sentence could be imposed) are not eligible for sealing in New York under the new law. Clean Slate Laws that Became Effective in 2023 In 2023, the following states had Clean Slate Laws that became effective – Arizona – January 1, 2023 The AZ Clean Slate law clears records only upon petitioning the state. Connecticut – January 1, 2023 (original effective date) The CT Clean Slate law automatically clearing certain types of convictions. Michigan– April 11, 2023 The Michigan Clean Slate law automatically cleared certain types of convictions. Alaska – May 1, 2023 Alaska’s Clean Slate law removed marijuana possession cases from the state’s online database of cases.

The Impacts of Clean Slate Laws on Employers While Clean Slate laws are widely applauded by some for their potential benefits, they also present some barriers in navigating the recruitment and hiring processes. One of the primary concerns raised by employers is how to ensure workplace safety, particularly for positions requiring a high level of trust or involving sensitive information, without knowing about the applicant’s past criminal behavior. Additionally, some employers also struggle in being able to understand if the applicant is even suitable for the position for which they applied. A lack of transparency into a job candidates criminal background also exposes employers to liability in the case of a negligent hiring lawsuits. The delicate balancing act between the societal goal of offering second chances and ensuring workplace safety and suitability remains a daunting task for employers. What Can Employers Do about Clean Slate Laws? As discussed in our Top 10 Background Screening Predictions for 2024, the Clean Slate law trend is not going to end any time soon. In anticipation of new legislation this year, employers should prioritize understanding, and complying with, relevant laws in the states in which they operate. It’s also important to recognize that compliance with these laws does not reduce the importance of comprehensive background checks. Rather, it remains the most effective means of evaluating an applicant’s suitability for the position and the company. Many employers are being proactive and are now opting for a more comprehensive approach to background checks to fill in the gaps and onboard the best-suited applicants while safeguarding the company’s interests. This often includes incorporating Social Media Checks, News and Publications, Employment Verifications, and Professional References to gain a more holistic understanding of the applicants. For example, various verification methods, including employment, education, professional licenses, and references, serve as resourceful tools in assessing an applicant’s character and integrity. These verifications help ensure the accuracy of information provided on resumes or job applications and reduce the likelihood of hiring applicants who are dishonest. Ultimately, employers bear the responsibility of knowing the individuals they hire. By embracing these practices, they can make more informed hiring decisions and mitigate potential risks without relying on criminal histories.

However, anytime you use information from background checks to make employment decisions, including hiring, retention, promotion, or reassignment. You must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Under the FCRA, background checks are considered \"consumer reports.\" Before running a background check (consumer report), employers must follow all the steps outlined in the FCRA. This post, we'll cover: What is the Fair Credit Reporting Act What are the employer's responsibilities under the FCRA? What is an Investigative Consumer Report? How the right background screening partner can help What is the Fair Credit Reporting Act? The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is a federal law designed to regulate the use of consumer report information and other background information received about individuals from consumer reporting agencies (CRA) like Orange Tree. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have enforcement authority for the FCRA. Some states have their consumer protection and/or employment laws that may apply. Here are some helpful terms to help you better understand the FCRA and how it applies to background checks. Consumer Report – The background check. A Consumer Report contains only accurate information, such as employment dates, criminal records, and driving history. Consumer Reporting Agency – The background screening provider preparing the background report; often referred to as a \"CRA.\" Investigative Consumer Report – Also a background check, but unlike a Consumer Report, includes information obtained through personal interviews. Disclosure – The document used to inform the consumer that they may be the subject of a background check. Authorization – The document signed by the consumer in which they authorizes preparation of the background check. Adverse Action – The process you must follow when considering an unfavorable employment decision based on the background or drug test. Consumer – The person who is the subject of the background check. User – The person who is requesting and using the background check (typically the employer or prospective employer).

The FCRA is a consumer rights law with strict procedures that must be followed to ensure the information contained in \"consumer reports\" is as accurate as possible. Employers are required to both disclose their intention to obtain a consumer report and obtain written consent from applicants or current employees before requesting a consumer report. Before getting a consumer report: Step 1: Provide Disclosure Make a clear and conspicuous written disclosure to the candidate or employee that you might use information in their consumer report for decisions related to their employment. This must be in writing and a stand-alone format. The notice cannot be in an employment application. The notice should not be combined with any other form. Step 2: Obtain Authorization Get written authorization from the candidate or employee to do the background check. If you combine this authorization form with any other form, be sure to keep it separate from the Disclosure. If you want the authorization to allow you to get consumer reports throughout the entire length of a person's employment (evergreen consent), make sure you say so clearly and conspicuously. What is an Investigative Consumer Report? If the consumer report asks for information such as job performance, it falls into a special category of consumer report called an \"Investigative Consumer Report.\" When an Investigative Consumer Report is requested, employers must: Disclose to the applicant that an investigative consumer report is being requested, along with a certain specified language. Unless it is contained in the initial Disclosure, the consumer must receive this additional Disclosure within three days after the request is made. The Disclosure must tell the applicant that they have a right to request additional information about the investigation's nature. If your CRA (background screening provider) is not obtaining authorization and Disclosure on your behalf, you must certify you have done the following: Have made the above Disclosure and gotten authorization from the candidate or employee to get a consumer report. Have and will comply with all of the FCRA requirements. Will not discriminate against the candidate or employee or otherwise misuse the information, as provided by any applicable federal or state equal opportunity laws or regulations. Other compliance considerations to note Some states have their consumer protection and/or employment laws that may apply. Some states and local jurisdictions also limit the timing of when a prospective employer may ask about or consider criminal record information about a candidate. Some states also restrict the consideration of credit history information in the employment context.

Fast-food employers nationwide will continue to face an ever-changing landscape of laws and regulations that will require both vigilance and foresight to navigate with confidence. Proceeding without attentiveness and care is likely to result in complications for even the most compliant of yesteryear’s policies; it is now, as always, in every QSR’s best interest to remain thoroughly informed about the latest developments in background-check legislation. While monitoring such developments is an ongoing task, the five trends listed below are indications of where employers ought to be looking as they approach the threshold of 2024. These are areas that show signs of significant change in the coming months, and which are likely to have noteworthy impacts on the background screening process. Keeping a close eye on these trends will not only safeguard fast-food employers from being blindsided, but will provide them with direction as they plan and adapt their background-check policies for the year to come. Ready to discuss your 2024 background screening needs? Reach out and speak with our team. 1. Marijuana Laws Becoming More Stringent Unsurprisingly, increasing regulations on marijuana screening will remain a strong trend for 2024. As more and more states legalize recreational use—Minnesota and Ohio being the most recent—regulations on testing for, inquiring about, and considering marijuana usage for employment will no doubt follow suit. States where such changes have already taken place are also likely to implement new, more progressive regulations. Both California and Washington will see new laws take effect on January 1st restricting employers from considering pre-employment records of usage—including criminal records in California—as well as any off-duty use. Others may well follow in their footsteps. 2. FCRA Changes Taking Effect The federal government, via the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is in an ongoing process of updating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Among the more recent changes was a 2023 amendment to the Final Rule of the Summary of Rights. While these alterations were generally non-substantive, ranging from terminology changes to updated contact information, the March 2024 compliance date means that employers must soon adhere to and—more significantly—provide certain candidates with the revised version. Being mindful of this change and those that follow it is an essential measure for QSRs who wish to avoid any risk of litigation. 3. Varied Privacy Laws Limiting Data-Use The varied restrictions on marijuana screening discussed in trend no. 1 are but a single example of the highly disparate laws that govern background checks across state lines, with privacy regulations serving as another notable instance. Since no federal privacy act exists, legislation on the matter varies widely from state to state. 2024 will see that particular problem become even more complex, as the states of Washington, Texas, Oregon, Florida, and Montana are all set to implement new privacy laws that will limit the use of human resource data. As the year progresses, therefore, many fast-food employers may need to adapt and revise how such information is used. 4. Court Interpretations Complicating Regulations Court decisions create precedent, naturally, and are therefore worth the attention of any QSR employer. This is especially true in light of increasingly disparate interpretations by local and federal courts of existing laws that govern how background checks may be carried out. One significant instance is the FCRA legislation which requires authorization from an employee or candidate before employers can take certain actions within the screening process. Court decisions on this issue have been subject to change over time and place, leaving employers in uncertain positions about exactly what permissions they need or need not be granted. In that case and others, fast-food employers are advised to heed the latest local and federal verdicts. 5. AI Laws Confining Decision-Making Machines As the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for efficient hiring becomes more commonplace, state legislators are introducing regulations aimed at protecting applicants and employees from discriminatory software. These laws limit the use of “decision-making” AI in particular by providing guidelines for what AIs can consider when furthering or denying an application. Certain states, such as New York, have already put regulations in place that require any such decision-making tools used in human resources to undergo a bias audit. As AI remains a relatively new territory, QSRs will do well to be especially attentive to legal developments in this area. Bottom Line 2024 is bound to see some dramatic changes in the legal scene for QSRs across the country. What that scene will look like a year from now can only be speculated, but the five trends discussed above offer a starting point. With a pulse on these indicators, fast-food employers will be able to follow the developments of the coming year as they unfurl. Those who do so, and who adapt along the way, will screen and hire with full confidence that the law, in all its complexity and caprice, is on their side.

From resume screening to candidate matching, it’s clear AI isn’t going anywhere. However, the confusion surrounding AI’s use in various aspects of recruitment and hiring is increasing right along with it, leaving employers overwhelmed when considering their own hiring practices. AI in Hiring: Efficiency vs. Risk According to Ideal.com, 52% of talent acquisition leaders say that the most difficult part of recruitment is actually identifying the right candidates from such large applicant pools. As such, many of them view AI as the welcomed solution—a way to address and analyze large data sets quickly and efficiently, without having to review hundreds of resumes themselves, and move the hiring process along to get positions filled. It may seem simple to some, but it is anything but. According to an “AI in Hiring and Work 2024 Survey” reported in Top AI in Hiring Statistics in 2024, while 44.2% of HR leaders reported significant acceleration in the hiring process due to AI, they also reported complicated challenges, including hiring bias (40%) and data privacy concerns (37.2%). As always, these types of challenges, including the increase in legal action in such a highly regulated industry, must be given due consideration. For employers then, it’s a delicate balancing act. The lure of automation and efficiency must be weighed against the inherent risks of potential bias, ethical considerations, and legal compliance. With the stakes so high, and the drastic increase in federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and guidance that attempt to keep up with this ever-changing landscape, employers must use caution if they choose to use AI in their hiring processes. Throughout the country, employers are getting sued, and this will undoubtedly continue as more of them continue to be tempted by AI’s implicit promise of efficiency.

Regulatory Oversight Within the past couple of years, the use of AI in hiring faced increased scrutiny from U.S. government authorities. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) held public hearings to examine the use of AI by employers in hiring decisions, as well as issued guidance regarding the use of software and other technologies in hiring and various employment decisions (“selection procedures”) and its compliance with federal civil rights laws and does not impede ADA requirements. The White House also released guidance in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights regarding the use of AI in the hiring process and in other areas. Last spring, a joint statement from federal agencies, including the EEOC, highlighted the enforcement of laws and regulations regarding AI’s impact on civil rights, fair competition, and consumer protection. And by the fall of last year, these statements and declarations transformed into action as the EEOC began enforcing their position more stringently. In a clear demonstration of their “pledge to vigorously use [their] collective authorities to protect individuals’ rights regardless of whether legal violations occur through traditional means or advanced technologies,” the EEOC entered a $365,000 Joint Settlement Agreement with a tutoring company based on claims that the company used hiring software that automatically rejected applicants based on their age. AI oversight is not limited to the federal government, though. Illinois now requires employers that use AI-enabled analytics in interview videos to take certain steps to ensure transparency and unbiased decisions, while Maryland prohibits employers from using facial recognition software unless the applicant signs a waiver. Further, New York City recently passed the Automated Employment Decision Tools Law, requiring a “bias audit,” where employment decisions are to be screened and audited annually to ensure that the use of AI technology does not result in discrimination. Other states are currently considering similar legislation. How Employers can Navigate AI in Hiring As employers continue to engage in this balancing act, weighing the pros and cons of using AI in their hiring processes, all against the backdrop of increased scrutiny and regulation, they can take several measures to minimize their risks. This approach not only helps to enhance the efficiency and reliability of their screening processes but also fosters a fair and ethical hiring environment. Here are five key strategies to minimize risk using AI in hiring. 1. Transparency Employers should ensure transparency in any AI algorithms and processes used for recruiting and hiring by providing clear explanations to applicants about how AI is being utilized in decision-making. Other than this communication to the applicants, employers should also clearly update their policies and procedures to address the use of AI in their hiring practices. 2. Addressing Bias Employers may want to regularly assess their AI models for potential bias. In this way, they can implement measures to mitigate bias in algorithms and help avoid discriminatory outcomes. This may involve using diverse and representative datasets during model training. 3. Compliance with Regulations With the ever-changing regulatory landscape, employers must stay informed about relevant laws and regulations governing background screening and the use of AI in hiring. This includes compliance with data protection regulations, anti-discrimination laws, and other legal requirements at the federal, state, and local levels to avoid legal consequences. Employers should consult their legal counsel to confirm that their processes are in compliance with these laws, as well as the guidance from the EEOC, with the understanding that failure to do so could result in costly litigation. 4. Human Oversight and Decision-Making Employers don’t want to lose the human touch in any respect, and this is no exception. They can do this by incorporating consistent human oversight in the recruiting and hiring process. While AI in hiring can automate certain tasks, human judgment is crucial for contextual understanding and making final decisions, particularly in processes that specifically deal with other individuals. This also helps to balance the limitations and potential biases of AI. 5. Regular Audits and Monitoring Referencing the New York City law as a guide, regardless of where employers are located, may be a good option to consider. Conducting regular audits of AI systems used in the recruiting and hiring processes to identify and address potential issues will likely emerge as a best practice throughout the country. Employers can implement ongoing monitoring processes to ensure the continued effectiveness, fairness, and accuracy of AI models.
