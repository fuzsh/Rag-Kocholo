        "text": "From Ken Treybig: The camp website has been updated with new articles and all the camp details for 2012, including a welcome from COGWA president Jim Franks. We are finalizing a new way of doing our background checks (required of all staff members working with minors) through a company called IntelliCorp. This will allow staff applicants to enter their own information over a secure server connection instead of needing to transmit it by email or fax. We will still pay the fee for the background check, but the new system will allow staff applicants the ease of entering their own information securely at the end of their online registration. Once IntelliCorp has finished creating the customized process, which we anticipate being by early the week of March 12 at the latest, we’ll be able to open registration for this year. If you have signed up to receive updates via email, we will send you a message as soon as online registration opens.\n\nMeanwhile, you can read about each of our programs at http://camps.cogwa.org. Most are in the same location as last year with the following exceptions: We’ve added a preteen camp in Minnesota; the Challenger program this year will be in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado; and the Houston preteen camp will move to Lantern Creek (formerly High Pockets) in Montgomery, Texas.\n\nStart making plans now to attend either as a camper or staff member, and sign up early. Don’t miss out on this great opportunity to build your relationship with God, learn more about His wonderful way of life and build great friendships!"
