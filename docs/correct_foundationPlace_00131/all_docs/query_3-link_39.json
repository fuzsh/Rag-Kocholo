        "text": "Last month, Youth Protection Committee Chair John Schesta encouraged all Club Members to read and sign a one page form entitled “Rotary Club Volunteer Behavior Expectations in District 6270 while working with Youth in Activities”. At our meeting on September 5, John let everyone know that the cost for conducting backgrounds reports by the District increases on October 1 and the following notice was issued by PDG, Bob Hosch of the District:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: Youth Protection Update\n\nCurrently we obtain criminal background reports from Intellicorp at a cost of $3.15 each. Intellicorp has announced changes in the price structure and content of these reports.\n\nAs of October 1, 2014 the cost per report will be $10.00 each. On July 1 2015 the cost will increase to $14.95 each.\n\nThese reports will include a national criminal search, national sex offender search, county of residence search, address history and verification of social security number. Clubs should be aware of these increases as they could have a budgetary impact. Get your club’s criminal background checks done before October 1, 2014 and save.\n\nYouth protection training is now done on line and as in the past is valid for 3 years. You must be registered in the system in order to take the training. It takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. To register you need to provide the name, email address, and phone number of each person to be registered. Forward all registrations to PDG Bob Hosch.\n\nThank you,\n\nBob Hosch, PDG\n\nEmail: rhosch@wi.rr.com\n\nD-6270 Youth Protection Committee\n\nRotary Statement of Conduct for Working with Youth\n\nRotary International is committed to creating and maintaining the safest possible environment for all participants in Rotary activities. It is the duty of all Rotarians, Rotarians’ spouses, partners, and other volunteers to safeguard to the best of their ability the welfare of and to prevent the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of children and young people with whom they come into contact.\n\nAdopted by the RI Board of Directors, November 2002"
