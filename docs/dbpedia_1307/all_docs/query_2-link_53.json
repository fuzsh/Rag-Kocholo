Pepper's and all of the lyrics sound like In My Life.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis album is so imaginative and so wildly different than what the rest of the British Invasion survivors were putting out, and I love every minute of it. Ray Davies loves hyperbolic irony and took great pleasure in skewering British imperialism and culture, but all the while using English colloquialism and flipping things on their head. Other than \"All of My Friends Were There\", this is a desert island disc. Fav Tracks: Big Sky, Starstruck, Monica, Picture Book and The Last of the Steam-Powered Train\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nConsidered a flop at time of release, this is basically a more upbeat Belle & Sebastian album. It's great.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nI just...can't. It just doesn't work in my brain.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis album made me want to listen to The Kinks more. The only thing I didn't like about this album is that some of the songs weren't particularly memorable but there aren't any songs that I would say are bad. This album also features a lot of interesting composition and chord progressions that are fairly unique and recognizable (like Johnny Thunder for example). The whole album describes a happy, ignorat upper-middle class lifestyle in a way that is at times satirical. Phenominal Cat is a song about a fat cat and honestly Andre Lloyd Webber wishes he could have written something as good as this. The only part of this album that I dislike is the verse of All of My Friends Were There because it feels a little too cheesy. Wicked Anabella reminds me of Maxwell's Silver Hammer in that it's a 60s song about an evil person and it SLAPS. Pictures of Each Other seems even more relevant today with lyrics such as \"People take pictures of each other, just to prove that they really existed.\" I think The Kinks roasted Instagram 42 years before it existed. Favorite songs: Picture Book, Last of the Steam-Power Trains, Sitting By the Riverside, Animal Farm, Village Green, Phenomenal Cat, Wicked Annabella, People Take Pictures of Each Other Least Favorite Song: All of My Friends Were There Light 9/10\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nNothing to hate here. Very solid representation of a time and place. There's some ... we'll call it \"experimental\" engineering choices on this album that didn't exactly work out all that great but, overall, it's a chill, fun, 60s britrock album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAn early concept album, on the notion of an Englishness that even in 68 was already gone... If it ever existed. Packed with different genres from music hall to psychedelia but always sounds like The Kinks. Elements which would influence ELO, early Bowie, Pink Floyd...\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI love this album, front-to-back. It's the Kinks at their most self-consciously uncool. The backwards-looking approach gives it a unique place in the 60s pantheon. The sidestep from psychadelia, prog, and heavier rock coming into vogue pre-sages decades of power pop to follow. While, in some senses, the Kinks music would become more vaudeville and theatrical in years to follow, this concept record hits a sweet spot of thematic consistency, playfulness, and exquisitely melodic songwriting. Favourite songs: Picture Book, Starstruck, Monica\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThe best way in which I can describe the Kinks is that they sound like the Beatles, but happier. The best way in which I can describe \"The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society\" is that it has perfect mixing (how can a 50+ year album sound this bloody good?) beautiful harmonies and a delightfully gleeful sense of nostalgia. Ray Davies refers to this record as as an affectionate acknowledgement of his culture, a statement on changes in life and memories that remain, and the search for new things to give meaning and enjoyment to living. In my case, I think the Kinks got it just right. 4/5.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat! Funny and interesting songs.

Rural retreats, vast swathes of farmland, friendly neighbourhoods, tea parties, Victorian music hall, the village green. Almost fifty years before this kind of nostalgia exposed itself as a complicated, damaging, Brexit-leaning force, Ray Davies was reading Dylan Thomas and reflecting on The Kinks having been banned from touring the US. What did his country mean to him? How was it changing with more and more technological advances? What was going to happen to it? Could the British Invasion go both ways, with the increasing Americanisation of his beloved home turf? The result is The Kinks’ maturation into one of the most versatile and singular bands of the 1960s, and Ray Davies’ blossoming into the next in a great line of romantic English poets pining for the pastoral. The title track of this album, “The Village Green Preservation Society”, is a perfect distillation of these ideals: a seemingly nonsensical lyric mostly comprises jumbled pop culture references from Davies’ childhood and beyond, expressed freely with little fuss or force. Desperate Dan, Sherlock Holmes, Mrs Mopps, Dracula, Donald Duck and many more sit side by side in a cozy, Utopian vision, as Davies searches for one group or another to feel part of. The music- gently strummed acoustic guitar, ramshackle piano intro, a hypnotic backbeat, short and simple riffs on electric guitar and whistling organ, breezy vocal harmonies- is absolutely spellbinding, perfectly capturing a naive innocence which grows more desperate with every key change. The album never quite surpasses its opener, but the themes of nostalgia, memories, change and aging are returned to again and again with a range of interesting perspectives and far more nuance than most of Davies’ contemporaries would have been able to muster. “Picture Book” and the ready-made-for-the-2020s “People Take Pictures of Each Other” consider our obsession with cataloguing memories, and the forlorn hope that a picture could somehow bring it all back. In “Do You Remember Walter”, a childhood friend may be fat, married and sedate, but “memories of people can remain”. Later, “Big Sky” and “Animal Farm” are pure joys of escapism in the face of an indifferent, unfeeling world. Then there’s the astonishing album-centrepiece, “Last of the Steam-Powered Trains”, in which Davies imagines himself as a train, all soot and scum, the voice of a missing-link generation. The album is at most threat of collapsing when the Kinks dial up the whimsy and branch into “When I’m 64”-style vaudeville. “Phenomenal Cat” is a sleepy Mellotron-led number which isn’t quite as clever or timeless as it wants to be. “Sitting by the Riverside” is pleasant but doesn’t quite land its cheap attempts at “Day in the Life” style crescendos. “Wicked Annabella” feels like an early-era Kinks track tacked on towards the end. But it’s easy to overlook these half-decent songs in favour of the brilliant ones. “The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society” is never unlistenable, and at its best it is transcendent. It also deserves points for having much more of a valid hold on the “early concept album” tag than Sgt. Pepper, or Pet Sounds. This is Davies making a full set of songs out of Brian Wilson’s “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times”. Peerless and unique songwriting, pitch-perfect performances… it’s superb.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI know the Kinks for the hits, but I don't know this album, and it doesn't have any of the big hits. But it's still solid musically, hard to fault. Pretty standard '60s rock, but nothing special really. Favorite tracks: Village Green Preservation Society, Big Sky, Picture Book. Album art: Cool band photo, love the swirly neon colors. Title is a mouthful though. 3.5/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGod shit\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWell, I just spent all morning discovering the Kinks and their long history through decades and genres. I hope there are more of their albums on this list. A 5.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nSince it’s a Sunday during a three day holiday weekend and I’ve got zero pressing responsibilities today, I’m listening to Village Green on vinyl, rather than streaming from my platform of choice. I’ve got a nice, clean 1975 Reprise US pressing that I found at Double Decker Records in Allentown, PA back in 2016 or so. Shout out to Double Decker, the best record store on the East Coast. The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society is a concept album of sorts, reflecting Ray Davies’ desire to preserve the culture and traditions of England’s past…or, at least, his recollection of traditions and culture past. I think most of us can relate to that sentiment: we might look back fondly on the decade(s) and culture in which we came of age and hope for a return, but for others, those times might have been miserable and worth leaving behind. In that regard, “Picture Book”, the third track on Village Green, might act as a mission statement for the record: “Picture book of people with each other…To prove they love each other, a long time ago”. Almost as though Ray Davies is saying, “Those were the days, weren’t they? Luckily we were able to preserve them, as reminder that things used to be better”. It may be a pessimistic take on my part, I know, but after the last few years on this planet, it’s hard not to look back fondly on the days where everything was simpler and more worry-free. Despite the nostalgic concept of the record, musically, Village Green is quite forward-thinking. The songs here feel like a blueprint, written and waiting to be uncovered and referenced by a thousand punk and indie rock bands 10, 20 or 30 years in the future. Not to harp on “Picture Book”, but I recall its use in a commercial in the early aughts and thinking it could be a Shins (or similar) song. Not that it’s surprising, even the Kinks earliest songs had an edge to their sound that the Beatles and Stones lacked, it’s unsurprising that their influence would be just as long lasting. I’m not going sit here and try and convince you that the Kinks were a better band than the Beatles or the Stones. I think they are, at least for their late 60’s/early 70’s output, but that’s a realization and personal preference that you’ll have to come to on your own…or not. I’m just saying that for some fans of punk and indie rock, the Kinks’ records might resonate stronger than the Beatles or the Stones do…and I am one of those people.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI would not hesitate to put this on a list of my 10 favourite albums ever.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThe Kinks are really underrated in my opinion. Sure, they have a couple of mega-hits but if you delve deeper into their catalog they have a bunch of super catchy, iconic songs that no one seems to have noticed. Picture Book is a great example - I only became aware of it because it was used in a commercial awhile back. What an awesome song! Great album all around. 4 stars.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\na nostalgic album about what England once was. no hits on here really except for a couple of songs later used in Hot Fuzz. not commercially successful at the time.

But then I heard the third-last song, Wicked Annabella, & I thought that Spotify had moved me to a 90s playlist, so I decided to give it another try. I like the Village Green track - I'm sure I can hear a harpischord in there somewhere and the other tracks now fall into place, though at times they sound a bit like a jug band. It's hard to believe this came out 4 years after You Really Got Me! I appreciate the fact that Davies didn't sucumb to pressure to produce another hit and stuck to the obscure.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nJe ne me souviens plus de l'album alors je vais vous raconter ma journée.

As it was, I passively listened to the album (both in real-time in Norway and a month later playing catchup) and came away thinking it was a decent enough baroque pop Beatles knockoff. I can't help but feel I'm missing something that fans are seeing, so I'll be generous and give it a 3.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nIf you happen to be in desperate need for some music for your retro style kids’ show, you might get some ideas from this album.

There are timeless hooks and builds that have influenced countless bands. Not to mention consumers. Some songs, or portions of them are ubiquitous in film scores (Darjeeling Limited) and commercials. 'Picture Book' was played in an HP Commercial that played incessantly in the early 2000's. Also the intro from 'Steam-Powered Trains' is used in either some Dick Pills, or Valtrex / STD-type commercials. And why not? With lines like \"I'm the last of the good old renegades, all my friends are middle-class and gray\" and \"last of the good choo-choo trains\" big pharma was obviously looking to connect with old dudes looking to plow twenty year-olds. The selection only makes sense. Anyhow, I really love the sound of this album. It's ragged, garage-y and crusty, yet loosely unified in all the right spots... perfect for old dudes.

In fact, unless you're related to the Davies or you happen to be Wes Anderson, you likely haven't heard any song from this album. It doesn't matter. This album is fucking great. I loved every minute of it, and I'm almost embarrassed that it took this long to finally get around to hearing it. This is a million times better than all the Byrds albums we've had to listen to here.

I think I like the mono mix better but the stereo version is better quality sound. I previously avoided The Kinks b/c of only having access to deluxe/super deluxe/expanded versions; makes for annoying last.fm scrobbles and I don't like having to look up what the original album included and then have save a playlist to avoid the extra, unneeded tracks later. Anyway, I really liked People Take Pictures of Each Other and Big Sky, which has been in my head all weekend. I think I like this as much as my previous favorite Kinks, Muswell Hillbillies.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWell, 'Starstruck' and the weird, slightly unsettling 'Monica' are two of my favourite Kinks tracks; whilst 'Picture Book' is one of my favourite pop songs, full stop. Just those three songs alone warrant five stars. But you know what? The rest is a joy too - charming, ambitious and seemingly unfettered by received notions of what rock music should treat as its subject matter.

Whereas Sgt. Pepper's contrasted a drab reality with an escape into psychedelia, Village Green escapes into a nostalgia for the past - and stays more grounded in doing so. It has a more consistent and even keeled tone. Okay, it does become a bit unraveled at the end, with the oddness of \"Phenomenal Cat\" and the jerky but dreamlike \"All Of My Friends Were There.\" Other than that though, this album flows like The River Thames. These songs seem to come from a very real and direct place. The product of honest self reflection. It amazes me that Ray Davies was only 24 years old at the time of recording this album. He was able to articulate the wisdom and perspective of someone well beyond his years.

It's chock full of well crafted songs with plenty of variety yet it holds together really well. I love the punchy production which makes it a little less whimsical than the preceding 'Something Else' album. The lyrics tell imaginary tales from a Ray Davies fantasy land. Diverse fables and characters about childhood, old school friends, old photographs, wicked witches, the pleasures of idleness, god, prostitutes, 1984, cartoon characters, village fetes. To top it off there's some fabulous vocals and instrumental arrangements. Personal favorites include 'Do You Remember Walter', 'Picture Book', 'Phenomenal Cat' and 'Monica' but pretty much every track is a winner. The only (minor) quibble is the lack of a well know \"classic\" - it's a shame 'Days' was not on the UK edition.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nBeautifully complex classic piece of literature detailing the wants of preservationalists in the 70s great highlights all around can't think of anything wrong with it... for the first listen I'm confident in giving it a 9.9/10\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nTitle track tells you what this album is: a memory project, a sonic collage of a time and place. I think that time is both relative (it's the childhood of The Kinks' band members) and also definite (England after the Second World War). The past often feels like an innocent time of untouched pleasures but we know it's an illusion. Things are hidden from children that they can only see with adult eyes. After the War, the Empire was crumbling and a century of unrest was nowhere near over. Of course when you're experiencing childhood and innocence, you're not conscious of it. You turn it into story and song later, in memory, with the benefit of adult hindsight. The tone of a project like that is what The Kinks get right. The songs are not exactly cheerful but have jingly mostly-major-key melodies that often introduce a note of uncertainty or irresolution. The ascending scale in Picture Book over the chorus is a good example of this. Ditto the very end of Sitting by the Riverside where the keys suddenly become uncanny for just a bit and upset the romantic fantasy before the last refrain comes in. The songs are fairly simple pop ballads, almost reminiscent of nursery songs, if you read them straight. But I think most, given the combination of lyrics and melody, are knowingly ironic. This can be a jaded and bitter irony: \"You're taken in by the lights, think you'll never look back...\" Or more reflective: \"People take pictures of each other, and the moment can last them forever, of the time when they mattered to someone...\" Sometimes it becomes comically self-consoling out of necessity: \"I went to that old cafe where I had been in much happier days, and all of my friends were there...\" You need to really listen to hear those hidden notes. I think the comparison to The Beatles is fair and some of the songs can be a little tedious. But it's just a bit more claustrophobic and sad because it isn't committed to being a transcendent experience like Sgt. Pepper. These songs are committed to making you uncomfortable rather than giving you a good time. It makes me want to listen to them again and again to detect their deceptive nuances.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nSuch a pleasurable album. Everything feels just right. The songs are all catchy (in a way that's not corny), the arrangement is engaging, fun and organic throughout--I particularly love the spare but well-chosen use of guitars––and the lyrics are witty and biting but never too cynical either. I love it.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI feel pure joy when I listen to the kinks. They are really great at making catchy songs that are also deceptively intricate. Almost none of their songs are simple 4 chord songs like every pop song today. Their songs often change keys or have interesting chord progressions; it’s pop perfection but it’s substantial enough to keep me interested. I love their vocal harmony sound (Their following album is better than this one)\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIt's really good, enjoyed it.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAbsolutely classic, if you haven’t heard this you’ve been missing out\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nWhat a great album!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nA beautiful album from The Kinks, full of nostalgia and longing for a rural England that perhaps never quite existed. Ray could always write a gorgeous melody and Dave and the band could bring it to vibrant life.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nGreat!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nMore recognizable songs. Beetles-esque sound\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis is bloody brilliant. For me it doesn’t have any standout hits, it’s just back to back gems. Masterpiece. Listening to this only makes me wish I could’ve also rated Something Else 5* too. Great album\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAbsolutely glorious, The Kinks are such a blast! Fave track - the title track is great, but \"People Take Pictures of Each Other\" is even better - long been one of my fave Kinks tunes. If we're including tracks recorded in the same session but inexplicably omitted from the album, then \"Days\" should get a mention too, as it's utterly halcyon, even if it has been co-opted by advertising with a vengeance....\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nOur fourth album by The Kinks and their best one for me so far. I rated the other ones 4 stars - but this one is a cut above them in terms of songwriting and musicianship. Still super close to The Beatles, but to The Beatles at their best.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI really loved The Kink’s fourth studio album from a few years before this (Face to Face), so I had high hopes for this. To my great surprise, this far exceeded my high hopes! Every song on this appeals to me. This album is quirky, musically varied, and overflows fun! I wasn’t exposed to a lot of The Kinks growing up, but I’m glad to be making up some of that lost time now. I’m becoming quite a fan of The Kinks.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClever and funny and good-hearted. The Kinks can play for me any day. And talk about rhymes: Consortium - awarded them, vernacular - Dracula, affiliates - and billiards. God save Donald Duck, vaudeville, and variety!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nTotally groovy! I think that I need to expand my familiarity of The Kinks. This 60s rock sounds sweet to me.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI really enjoyed and appreciated this delightful album. It’s warmly nostalgic and so much fun to listen to.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n9/10. I do love a good concept album, though I do think the concept of this one started to wear a little thin, since you can only sing for so long about how you miss the good old days, especially if you're only going to present an idealized picture of said good old days. Still, I quite liked most of the songs, and pastoral poetry is perennially pleasant, so a high score all in all.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI had never heard this album before, but it is really, really good. Strong instrumentals and harmonies, catchy toons, excellent lyrics. I was really impressed.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\ncool\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLoved this!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this bouncy classic. Smart, pop-y bangers.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nPretty much perfect. Big Sky gets me through those days when the world seems against you.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nClassic British music.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n*chef's kiss*\n\n👍"
