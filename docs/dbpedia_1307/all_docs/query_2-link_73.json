        "text": "By\n\nIt recently occurred to me, I haven’t heard the term “hard rock” for what seems like decades. These days, it’s all heavy metal this or metal that, not to mention metal’s myriad sub groups. Once it was simple. There was hard rock and not-so-hard rock, otherwise known as pop. Soft rock was yet to become a genre.\n\nThe original Hard Rock cafe in London was great and unique when it opened in 1971. Now, of course, it’s a bit of a cliche, with branches all over the world\n\nGuys, in general, liked it hard and riff-driven. Girls usually preferred the softer songs. We’re generalising here, of course. Some girls liked it hard. And we mustn’t forget, when a certain rock & roll themed restaurant first opened its doors in London in 1971, they called it “Hard Rock” because metal wasn’t even invented.\n\nNow, in this attempt to track the development of the earliest hard rock riff, I’m taking myself back to when I was around 12 and used to sneak into what we used to call dances, rather than gigs and suchlike. We’re talking about 1962 here – before the Beatles turned the pop and rock world on its head.\n\nIn those formative years of blues-rock, inspired sets of guitar-based rhythm & blues seemed the norm in the UK, rather than the exception. Perhaps this was because I was new to live music and unable to gauge its quality like I feel I can now with all these years under my belt. Anyway, my memory says it was all fantastic.\n\nTwo of rock & roll’s greatest song writers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller\n\nwith rock & roll’s greatest solo performer. Leiber and Stoller wrote\n\n“Hound Dog” and “Jailhouse Rock” for Elvis as well as a string of\n\nclassics for the Coasters and many, many others\n\nCovers of old blues and classic American R&B from\n\nthe 1950s, in those first years of the 60s, were always guaranteed to get the\n\nroom rocking, before the usual dance hall fights erupted. Three songs from\n\nthose days stick in the mind and, remarkably, all were written by those\n\nillustrious Jewish-American song writers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, for\n\nthat seminal African-American rock & roll group, the Coasters.\n\nIndeed, as an example of Coasters’ tremendous influence\n\non rock and pop music, they were the first group to be inducted into America’s\n\nRock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Yet, when I was lucky enough to see them ‘live’,\n\nin an outer-suburban beer barn in Melbourne, Australia, in 1974, called South\n\nSide Six from memory, the Coasters had been relegated to playing second-rate\n\nout-of-town venues. Such is the fickleness of the music industry, as every\n\nmusician can testify. They were excellent, by the way.\n\nRock & Roll pioneers: the fabulous Coasters\n\nThe three Leiber/Stoller/Coasters songs all the pre-Beatles\n\nguitar bands seemed to cover were: “Poison Ivy”, “Love Potion No. 9” (given to\n\nThe Clovers first) and “I’m A Hog For You (Baby)”.\n\nThese great R&B numbers\n\nwere standard fare for every band that rocked in Britain before the Beatles\n\nexploded, including the Beatles, themselves. I’m sure that rings true for\n\nAmerica, too.\n\nA fourth U.S. R&B song also covered by the\n\nearly guitar British bands was ”Louie Louie” – a Hot Chocolate offshoot of which was recently used as the theme\n\nsong to Louis C.K.’s award-winning TV show. Written in 1955 by Richard Berry,\n\n“Louie Louie” was the catalyst for the first hard rock riff that led to metal.\n\nAnd here’s why. It’s generally accepted that The Kinks’ “You Really Got Me” was\n\nthe first hard rock riff in rock history, due to their lead guitarist Dave\n\nDavies slashing his amp’s speaker cone with a razor to get those fabulous\n\ndistorted power chords. If you’d like to remind yourself of the early Kinks\n\nwith “You Really Got Me”, they’re here below.\n\nEarly Kinks before they were banned in America\n\nLink to The Kinks’ “You Really Got\n\nMe” here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq_KQYVPadQ\n\nDave’s brother, The Kinks lead singer and main song\n\nwriter, Ray Davies, has said that he wrote “You Really Got Me” whilst trying to\n\nwork out the chords to “Louie Louie”. Whether this was Richard Berry’s 1957 original\n\ntrack, Rockin’ Robin Roberts’ adaptation in 1961 or the 1963 worldwide hit\n\nversion by Portland’s The Kingsmen, you’ll have to ask Ray Davies. The Kingsmen’s\n\ntrack, however, remains the best known of some 150 covers including by the\n\nBeatles, Beach Boys, Black Flag, Clash, Doors, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead, Iggy\n\nand the Stooges (see last post), Led Zeppelin, Otis Redding, Motorhead, Mothers\n\nof Invention (said to have fired their guitarist because she couldn’t play it),\n\nTrogs (whose “Wild Thing” uses a similar chord progression) and so on.\n\nThe original Kingsmen in 1963. It was probably their version of\n\n“Louie Louie” that inspired Ray Davies to write “You Really Got Me”.\n\nLink\n\nto The Kingsmen’s “Louie Louie” here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL20vPIXs-A\n\nHere’s\n\nThe Kinks version of “Louis Louie”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXVjhbUnOk8\n\nAnd now try\n\nThe Kinks’ “Milk Cow Blues”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwDBepAv4KU\n\nI say The Kinks’ “Milk Cow Blues” but readers of\n\nthe post- before-last will know it as Sleepy John Estes’ “Milk Cow Blues”. I’ve\n\nincluded it to give an example of just how good a blues rock band The Kinks\n\nwere before Ray’s song writing lost its youthful bite (in my opinion) and\n\nstarted bordering on the twee and comical. Funnily enough, I was working\n\nalongside their PR, Marion Rainford, in London that very year and remember my despair\n\nwhen The Kinks’ came out with “Ape Man”. Marion was truly delightful, kind and\n\nhelpful to a young boy (me) so I thought I’d check her out to see if she was\n\nstill around. I found her in a local London newspaper. Apparently she gave up\n\nrock to teach ballroom dancing. Have a read, if only to find out how rock PRs\n\ncan have a very un-rock life after rock & roll:\n\nEven though I’d seen The Kinks in the office, I\n\ndidn’t mention where I worked when inadvertently bumping into Dave Davies at\n\nthe Chesford Grange Hotel near Warwick, England, at a gig there in 1970. Being\n\n1970, pathetic English snobbery was still in full swing. In 1970, being dressed\n\nlike long-haired 20-year-olds meant not being let into the hotel’s comfortable lounge\n\nbar for a drink, rather than putting up with the hot and stuffy beer tent laid\n\non for the music punters.\n\nDave Davies didn’t just play the first hard rock/\n\nheavy metal power chords, he was a nice person, too\n\nAs we argued the point at the door, a voice\n\nboomed out, “I’m in here. Why can’t they be?” From inside the lounge bar\n\nstrode Dave Davies who proceeded to give the door monkeys what for. “They’re\n\ndressed the same as me. You can’t stop them coming in”.\n\n“Oh, yes we can. You’re a guest. They’re not.”\n\n“Well, they can come in as my guests,” said Dave,\n\ninviting an unruly group of five of us into the plush lounge and chatting amiably\n\nwith us until it was time to go on stage. Dave hadn’t a clue that I worked with\n\nMarion. We were complete strangers, which made me realise what a nice man he\n\nwas and, presumably, still is.\n\nUnfortunately, The Kinks stellar career in\n\nAmerica was cut short in 1965 by a four year ban by the American Federation of\n\nTelevision and Recording Artists, said to have arisen due to The Kinks not\n\npaying their union fees after playing a Dick Clark special on NBC. That Ray\n\nDavies had reportedly punched a union official for calling England ‘communist’\n\nwouldn’t have helped.\n\nYears later, Ray Davies said, “In many respects, that ridiculous ban took away the best\n\nyears of the Kinks’ career when the original band was performing at its peak.”\n\nI’d go even further and say that’s when Ray’s song writing\n\nlost its edge, became middle-of- the-road\n\nRay Davies. To me, Ray stopped writing great rock & roll songs\n\nand The Kinks stopped being a great rock & roll band after they\n\nwere barred from playing in America in 1965\n\nand started concentrating on\n\npredominantly English themes like “The Village Green Preservation Society” and “Arthur”.\n\nThat’s just my view, of course. The majority of British Kinks fans would violently\n\ndisagree and say this was when Ray Davies started writing his best songs like “Waterloo\n\nSunset”, “Lola” and so on.\n\nEach to their own. I preferred The Kinks playing rock-blues\n\nwith heavy riffs and just wonder how the band would have developed had they\n\nbeen allowed to regularly tour America. Let’s finish with a Kinks song from 1965,\n\nthe year they were banned in the USA; the year, for rock and The Kinks, as far\n\nas I’m concerned, the music died.\n\nFinally, The Kinks’ “All Day\n\nAnd All of the Night”: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4DV-5d6a5g\n\nShare this:\n\nSimilar Posts\n\nWeird Al Yankovic gives us the best English lesson ever\n\nBy\n\nWe dont need know educaishon STOP PRESS 25 July 2014.
