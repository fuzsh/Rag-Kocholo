        "text": "MUSIC: Ray Davies puts on stellar performance detailing 30 years\n\nof rock\n\nBy Mike Prevatt\n\nDaily Bruin Senior Staff\n\nRay Davies, former frontman of the successful ’60s rock outfit\n\nThe Kinks, delighted the near-capacity crowd Thursday night at the\n\nWadsworth Theater with a witty, moving performance of his life’s\n\nstory titled \"20th Century Man.\"\n\nRecreating his \"20th Century Man/The Storyteller\" one-man show\n\nthat aired previously on VH-1, Davies brought together older\n\ndiehards and the young, curious music fans with the nostalgic yet\n\ninfluential music that took The Kinks to the top of the charts in\n\nthe ’60s and ’70s. The mood inside the Wadsworth was enjoyably laid\n\nback and light as Davies sang the favorites and told amusing, if\n\nnot hilarious, anecdotes.\n\nDavies’ \"20th Century Man\" hardly took on responsibilities of\n\nbeing grandiose rock star, as the show itself deviated from\n\nconventional pop concert structures. Instead, the one-man show\n\n(with guitarist Pete Mathison strumming toward the back of the\n\nstage) was like the rock ‘n’ roll version of Garrison Keillor’s\n\n\"Lake Wobegon\" shows. Reading from his 1995 \"unauthorized\n\nautobiography\" titled \"X-Ray,\" Davies would tell story after story\n\nabout growing up in London with his family and eventually forming\n\nThe Kinks. Yet half of the near two-and-a-half hour \"story\" was\n\ntold using the introspective songs he wrote for his band.\n\nDavies strolled on stage to wild cheers and instantly charmed\n\nthe crowd with his friendly banter. When he asked the audience what\n\nguitar he should play – the one that reflected his poetic side or\n\nthe one that reflected his rock ‘n’ roll side – the crowd roared\n\nfor the latter. Davies chose the poetic guitar instead, quipping,\n\n\"I’m so lacking in self-confidence, I don’t even trust you!\"\n\nYet Davies represented confidence at its best. He took control\n\nof the stage without a hint of hesitancy or discomfort. Even the\n\nrock-star arrogance turned humorous and even satirical at times.\n\nThis star knew he deserved recognition and acclaim, but never put\n\nhimself or The Kinks above anyone else … especially the devoted\n\nsitting in front of him.\n\nThe crowd became instantly thrilled when Davies opened with\n\n\"Lola,\" one of The Kinks’ biggest hits, which segued into his\n\nstory-telling segment. With songs like \"Lola,\" \"Dead End Street\"\n\nand \"Rock ‘n’ Roll Fantasy,\" the audience finished lines and verses\n\nfor Davies loudly and in key. Screams filled the air when Davies\n\nlaunched into \"Victoria,\" a song about the famous Queen who ruled\n\naround the turn of the century … giving some range to the \"20th\n\nCentury Man\" title.\n\nDavies took listeners through the various stages of his life,\n\nfrom growing up with sex-starved sisters, buying his first, 8-watt\n\namplifier (\"The Green Amplifier\") and yearning to be different from\n\nall the other suburbanites in the hills of northern London. One\n\namusing yet moving story involved looking at the life of a\n\nhunchback, which led Davies at one point to seek out the experience\n\nof living like a cripple.\n\nAnd as Davies told his stories, certain songs weaved in and out.\n\nAs Mathison played bluesy licks on the lead guitar, Davies took\n\ncontrol of the rhythm on his two guitars, gulping down his \"stout\"\n\nduring the show. The music and the themes shared the same soulful\n\nemotion for the entire show, with Davies’ vocals ranging from soft\n\nand reflective (\"See My Friends\") to loud and soaring (\"Lola\").\n\nThe story reached its climax when Davies talked about the\n\nformation of The Kinks. The group included his younger brother,\n\nDave. He went into their early days of performing in front of\n\nfamily in \"the front room,\" where \"everything important happens,\"\n\nto their first gig at a club, which they got thanks to their\n\nsister’s bouncer boyfriend (who got in return advice from Dave on\n\nhow to score oral sex from the sister). Davies jammed into classics\n\nlike \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" and \"Well Respected Man.\"\n\nAll of this, of course, was a pre-cursor to \"You Really Got Me,\"\n\nthe number one single that made The Kinks huge. Within seconds of\n\nthe song’s first notes, the crowd roared as Davies gave the song\n\nclarity but kept the rock ‘n’ roll grit.\n\nFor an (extended) encore, Davies and Mathison played favorites\n\nlike \"Waterloo Sunset\" and \"Celluloid Heroes,\" signing copies of\n\nhis book for various members of the crowd who had rushed the\n\nstage.\n\nIt perfectly represented his easy-going and fan-friendly\n\npersonality. Davies still has the groupies, still has the talent to\n\nplay the hits just right – and, most importantly, still has the\n\ncharisma and attitude to wow a crowd. With stars of classic rock\n\ndigging in the vaults to milk their material for money (The\n\nBeatles) or putting on lucrative tours (The Eagles, The Rolling\n\nStones), it’s refreshing to see Ray Davies doing something that’s\n\nmore soulful and intimate, and certainly less pretentious. It would\n\nbe interesting to see others pull the same concept off too. But\n\nthen again, few artists possess the autobiographical tunes Davies\n\nhas amassed in the past 30 years, making him indeed a true pop\n\n\"storyteller\" for this century.\n\nEMI-Capitol"
