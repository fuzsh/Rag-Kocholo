        "text": "More than any of their contemporaries, the Kinks stormed through three decades with a natural survival instinct that rarely compromised their ideals. Their early garage rock days are the most celebrated, and their greatest singles come from that era. But their late-'60s albums -- starting with the terrific Something Else by the Kinks and including the classic The Village Green Preservation Society -- are more sophisticated, reflecting singer and songwriter Ray Davies' interest in Victorian society, which he juxtaposed with hippie culture and a clear-cut vision of class division through the ages. The Kinks revived their classic power chord riffs in the late '70s, which led to an early-'80s comeback and their first Top 10 single in a dozen years. Our list of the Top 10 Kinks Songs is heavy on those classic '60s singles, but you should also check out their great albums from that decade."
