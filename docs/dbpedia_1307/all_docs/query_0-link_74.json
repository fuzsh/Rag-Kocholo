        "text": "Dave Davies formed the earliest incarnations of what would become The Kinks with bassist Pete Quaife and the occasional involvement of his older brother, Ray. When Ray fully committed to the band (known variously as The Boll-Weevils, The Ravens and eventually The Kinks), they won iconic status via Dave’s remarkable guitar playing and Ray’s incomparable songwriting. However, what few realise is that some of the band’s earliest pre-Pye original material came from the pen of Dave Davies.\n\nThroughout The Kinks’ career he remained the creative lightning rod that brought their songs to the public and despite recent health issues has remained active writing and recording (he is preparing a solo album for 2013, I Will Be Me). Here, he reveals much about The Kinks’ formative influences.\n\nRC: What are your thoughts on the just-released The Kinks At The BBC box set? The sessions sound quite different to the studio recordings you made at Pye.\n\nDave Davies: Well, it was totally different. More open stage and no [baffle] screens. Studios in those days were like a loony bin: a padded cell – they dampened everything. The BBC was more like a regular stage set-up. They had soundproof screens, but just to cut down the ambience, rather than deadening the sound too much. It was more like a doing a gig than recording, the feeling, you know. You knew you’d be out in time for the pubs to open! When you go into a recording studio, you could be there all night.\n\nWhat were your experiences working with producer Shel Talmy (Kinks’ producer 1964-67)?\n\nWell funnily enough, I liked Shel and I remember we had a lot of problems with him. I think he fancied himself as the new Phil Spector. So we had a few problems at the beginning, because he was thinking in that Phil Spector mode: everything’s got to be big, with lots of long, delayed echoes. And we thought it sounded horrific, really. I mean, You Really Got Me with a four-second delay echo, reverb echo on it, all this stuff. So there was a learning curve for Shel and us. I think once he realised we wanted a bit smaller and grittier, in-your-face [sound], it started to work well.\n\nDave, you were interested in record production from the outset…\n\nRay and I were very interested in sound. “What you doing? What they doing? What does that knob do? What does that do?” Of course, when something isn’t sounding quite right, you’ll ask about the EQ and, “What kind of EQ?”, all that stuff. It was obviously a big learning curve for us all. And Ray having… when you’re writing, you have an idea in your head, a vision. You can never reproduce that. But you’re always asking questions about “What’s that? What if … ?”\n\nTell me about one of your early songs that The Kinks never recorded, One Fine Day (released by Shel Naylor on Decca in March 1964 and likely to have featured session players Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones). Did you do a demo?\n\nI bumped into someone in Denmark Street, you know, Tin Pan Alley. In Larry Page’s [one of The Kinks’ managers at the time] office, there was a guy called Shel Naylor who was looking for a song. I thought, “Shit, I can write something.” I always loved The Ventures. It’s funny: if you think back to the masses of wonderful Kinks songs, there’s a lot of them got that [Ventures’ chord progression] C, Am, G, F. You know like Walk Don’t Run and all of those things. We relied heavily on those chords: Father Christmas has got it. So many songs; Shangri-La.\n\nOne Fine Day, I just banged it out and I think they were the only chords I knew on the piano. And then we made a quick demo, but it was purely so Shel could get the song across. I did write a lot of songs. I wrote the first song we recorded, which was I Believed You [a bonus track on the Deluxe Edition of Kinks, sourced from Dave’s original acetate]. Ray sang it and Pete messes the song up in the middle. I was always writing. I think the big difference was that I was also wanting to have a good time, so I’d like to be out partying, chat up the chicks, and hanging out. And why not?\n\nLet’s talk about your early influences.\n\nI loved The Ventures. They had a much bigger influence on us than a lot [of people realise]. Johnny Cash, Buddy Holly. Eddie Cochran, for me, was like a God. He had the right clothes. He looked good. His haircut: that sort-of rock’n’roll 50s look. He was really a great guitarist when you consider that he was probably one of the most progressive electric players for his time.\n\nGreat songs too.\n\nOh! Brilliant. If you play Somethin’ Else by Eddie Cochran now, wow, man, the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. That’s why we called our album Something Else. It was all, like, little gestures and tipping your hat to stuff you got inspired by.\n\nBuddy Holly was a big, big influence on Ray’s writing. And Ray used to mimic him, singing. That’s how I used to get Ray up on the mic to sing Rave On [in our early days as The Boll-Weevils]. Ray was a great mimic. He used to mimic loads of people. Jerry Lewis [comedian/filmmaker] – he looked like him. That’s how we learned: copying people. And fortunately for me, I found it really hard to copy phrases and guitar lines, so when I used to reproduce them, they’d come out slightly different. I found out years later they call that “improvisation”! Ray was much better at playing things like Apache. We had to play it note-for-note.\n\nThe Shadows were good. The American records, The Ventures and The Champs – Tequila by The Champs was always being played in our house as a kid, growing up.\n\nYou once told me that in the 60s, you and Ray would listen to some contemporary artists like The Lovin’ Spoonful and The Byrds.\n\nOh, yeah. Big, big fans of the Spoonful and Byrds. The Byrds and The Lovin’ Spoonful, I think, were the first two contemporary influences, if you like. I mean, you can hear it in Shangri-La on Arthur. There’s a bit in the middle that sounds like Summer In The City, the chord progressions, you know. A big influence.\n\nAnd Rasa (Davies, Ray’s wife and backing vocalist on many of the group’s mid-60s recordings) liked The Mamas And The Papas?\n\nShe was a big big fan. So whenever we’d do something, sittin’ on the piano, she used to fancy herself as a bit of a singer and we’d include her. She’d sing the top harmony or an octave. Rasa was really important. Of course, Pete [Quaife] was [too], because he had input in a lot of musical and vocal ideas. It was like a singing group. We were also big fans of The Searchers and The Hollies, and they had what to us seemed like really intricate vocal harmonies, so we used to do bad Searchers covers. We were so impressed when we signed a contract with Pye, the same label as The Searchers! That’s why we wrote the songs You Do Something To Me and You Still Want Me – our first singles. They sound very Searchers-like. [And they were recorded] in the same studio. How about that!\n\nApart from the obvious blues guys, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters and earlier still, Leadbelly, all these great people [I liked] another great writer at the time, Jackie DeShannon. The Searchers covered a few of her tunes. And we were great mates with The Hollies. They liked our rough and ready edge and we liked their technical cleverness.\n\nThe Kinks used to play Manchester, The Hollies’ hometown, quite a bit.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester were our hunting grounds in the early days. Because all the main venues were there. London wasn’t as prolific as it became a bit later; after ’64, London kind of took over. We were even billed at one time as “The Kinks from Liverpool”, if you can believe that. And Pete Quaife even adopted sort of a Liverpudlian accent!\n\nOne of the best R&B records from that era is your version of Milk Cow Blues, which is an unbelievable performance on The Kink Kontroversy.\n\nI loved that. Me and Pete worked near each other when we had normal, proper jobs. We’d always meet at lunchtime and go to Dobell’s, a famous jazz/blues shop where you could get these amazing records by people like Sleepy John Estes, who nobody’d heard of. I used to think if it was somebody I didn’t know, maybe I could learn something. I was always buying these funny albums from some weird guy called John Lee Hooker and he turned out to be another big influence. Slim Harpo, haunting harp playing. Sonny Boy Williamson. So many influences. It was such an exciting time. When you spend your life growing up on great stuff like Elvis or the pop music of the 50s, finding blues records was like finding treasure. Because it was simple riffs, being able to copy the riffs was a big help, you could practice while you’re playing in a way.\n\nTell me about another blues number you picked up that you did on a BBC session and kind of rewrote: Good Luck Charm, by Spider John Koerner?\n\nI had a friend at school when I was about 14 or 15, a guy called George Harris. We learned guitar together. Skiffle, Lonnie Donegan, Bert Weedon and these people. But he had access to this guy called Spider John Koerner. And he copied these riffs from these real blues guys and he had a kind of shuffley vibe to his music, which we really liked. And it was kind of Leadbelly meets country, bit folky, sort-of rootsy, kind of fun music. Me and George, we used to go into his bedroom and he had chains and locks behind his door, because he was always paranoid about police raiding places – he was always smoking reefer. So we’d keep behind padlocks and we’d start riffing out these Spider John Koerner records, and they’re wonderful. Unfortunately, [George] died with drugs but we always thought we’d have a band together. But it wasn’t to be.\n\nYou did a studio version too of Good Luck Charm with some wild piano and mellotron work from Nicky Hopkins. It surfaced among many other oddities on your 2011 Hidden Treasures solo collection.\n\nNicky Hopkins was great on everything. Such a virtuoso. He did some inspiring work with The Kinks and The Who and other bands. But he was great with us. He was very generous, like Bobby Graham, he was a very generous person. He helped you along. Because we didn’t know what we were doing! All you needed was someone like Bobby Graham, who had been through the mill. Nicky, he understood music and arrangements and where to put colour. It was inspiring to be alongside those sorts of people.\n\nNicky added so much to Face To Face, like Rosie Won’t You Please Come Home with the harpsichord, and Session Man.\n\nAbsolutely. Wonderful. Really made the songs work. He’d take them into a different direction, almost. They’re basically folk songs, a lot of those songs, written by a family around a piano. That’s how folk music started out: little families getting together on Saturday night with a beer and talking about life and writing music. So I think Kinks’ music, in a way, grew out of a sort of folk tradition.\n\nThe Spoonful were playing like an electric, folky kind of thing. Middle-class, sort of a folky vibe. But they had some cool riffs. I don’t know who produced their records [Erik Jacobsen], but they were astonishing. Of course, The Byrds were like another step up above that. Those early Byrds’ records were phenomenal.\n\nDuring the later 60s you got into The Band.\n\nThey reminded me of an updated version of The Byrds. That sort of raw Americanness that I loved and that I looked for in the old blues. Hank Williams; I looked for it in that and got inspired. Strangers [on ’70’s Lola Vs Powerman And The Money-Go-Round, Part One] was inspired by a Hank Williams tune, I’ll Never Get Out Of This World Alive. “If I live too long, I’m afraid I’ll die.”\n\nWe were lucky because we had access to all this wonderful music. My sister Rene lived in Canada. When she used to come over, we’d hear Chuck Berry, weird stuff. But The Band had that sort of folky, rootsy, earthy, soulful white American feel, which previously belonged to a different culture: black Southern States culture.\n\nThese guys were playing this great folk music, accordions and tubas. It’s all based around the songs. It wasn’t like you got a good guitar sound like we did. You Really Got Me was about a guitar sound, really, and we put some words over it. But The Band were about songs and other meanings. A song could be about something other than what you thought it was about when you first heard it. So I really got into that multi-layer kind of thing about, “Well, maybe it’s not about that. It could be about this or that.” Beautiful, very inspiring.\n\nThe Kinks sort of adopted more of that sound for ’71’s Muswell Hillbillies, I think.\n\nWell, that was kind in a jokey way because we always loved country music. Earl Scruggs and Lester Flatt. We loved that banjo-picking. My dad played banjo. He played the five-string key banjo and I used to pluck on it and fiddle about with it. You have to think: us kids growing up in the 50s and early 60s, America was this golden place, like a treasure trove of culture of all this beautiful, amazing music. It was so inspiring.\n\nWe had OK music in England, but it lacked sonic balls. Our music was a bit poppier, a bit poncier – insipid is a bit cruel – but I mean, ordinary. I’m sure that was a lot to do with the black input into their culture. American black people had a much harsher history of slavery and I think that injected a lot into the white music and country music.\n\nWhen you think about it, Hank Williams was singing about very similar things to Leadbelly, Big Bill Broonzy. Oppression, getting drunk and getting laid and about how miserable life is. But I think Hank Williams has a lot of dark humour in his music – that storytelling thing, wonderful.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about your solo material from the late ’60s, which finally came out on Hidden Treasures. Were you happy that it finally saw the light of day?\n\nI’m glad it came out. But I was so depressed [at the time of the original recording sessions]. I didn’t really want to make an album. I’ve always been that sort of person. If I didn’t want to do it, you couldn’t force me. And that’s what happened, really. A couple of tunes went well. We did Creeping Jean, which I loved. I was trying to replicate the slide guitar I was playing. But the longer it went on, it became doomier, like that track Crying. I said, “Oh no, I’ve got to go into the fuckin’ studio again.” Crying had doomy chords.\n\nSo was it your management that was egging you on to do this solo thing?\n\nYeah. I didn’t really want to do it; the novelty of it wore off quite quickly. It seemed like hard work. I wanted to go out partyin’. In the early days, we were so supportive of each other. You’ve got to have support, family or someone financial, good management or something to help you, because it’s hell out there, man!\n\nThe Kinks opened their recording studio, Konk. What was your motivation?\n\nWell, the thing for me is that I’d always been the one that was into the equipment. And I had a little set-up at home, I was always trying to get Ray [interested in a studio]:\n\n“You should get one of these,” or “Why don’t you get that?” but he’d end up borrowing mine, so I didn’t have any! So I thought, rather than spend these tens of thousands of pounds in Morgan and all these up-and-coming, high-tech recording studios, I thought it was easy, you just lash out and buy the same and do it ourselves. Which was really my idea in the beginning; I couldn’t get Ray to sign the bloody cheque! Eventually we persuaded him and I thought, “Hell, I’m getting the biggest speakers – Altec Lansing.” It took me a year to realise they were shit. I started to realise big doesn’t always mean good. So hang on, let’s go back a bit. And we got to record all those funny, quirky albums like Soap Opera and the Preservation album. Preservation, I virtually engineered all that stuff.\n\nWe did other recordings because we had the Konk label. We had Andy Desmond and Café Society, which was Tom Robinson’s entrance into the music business. So we had a few people on the periphery of the label, the Konk label, who were trying to get recorded. And I love recording. I really like it. I grew to hate it again! In a way a part of me preferred recording stuff [as the engineer] instead of playing it.\n\nWhat did you make of Ray extending the Village Green concept in Preservation Acts I & II?\n\nI always thought that Village Green thing was sort of a bit of a black hole because we couldn’t go back to America, whereas our contemporaries were all at Woodstock. We’d sidetracked ourselves off that by getting banned [from performing due to a dispute with the American Federation Of Musicians union]. What often happened, growing up, was we turned back to family, and Village Green was very much about family and about where we lived, this history and the funny characters. People like “Johnny Thunder” were a mixture of two or three different characters from our childhood. All this started to emerge out of Ray’s writing. It was a mixture of our family memories and the support of being a family, and feeling a bit like outsiders because everybody else was doing something really different. It sort of emerged at a strange, poignant time for us. Again, it’s like folk music: getting together at the weekend with ideas and muddling through stuff.\n\nYou did some amazing guitar stuff on Village Green that’s underrated…\n\nAll my stuff’s underrated! I come from that background of listening to rock’n’roll songs. We played Chuck Berry. It was an amazing guitar sound and tone and technique. The sonic elements of it and the piano were intrinsic to Chuck Berry. And the vocals and the songs and lyrics – it’s like a composite work of art.\n\nWhen Ray and I would get together and he’d have a half-version of Sunny Afternoon, and Rasa would just be singing a few la-la-la-las, and I could see it forming – the whole thing. I’d always know something was going to do well; I had that feeling. I had great guidelines, listening to Hank Williams, and I had seen what songs told the best stories, accompanied by the best musical ideas – it’s composition we’re talking about. Like Sweet Little Sixteen. It’s a whole piece of music. It’s sensational, if you play it now. It’s got everything. If it was a painting, it’s got every shade of the time it was painted in; the colour, even the smells. You can almost smell that music.\n\nThere’s another early song of yours that The Kinks never recorded that’s really cool, She’s My Girl.\n\nIt’s when I had a Fender 12-string and was a big, big fan of The Byrds. She’s My Girl was really based on an experience I had. My first love. We had a baby, and she took her away and I never got to see her and it was a sad sort of song based on that. But it’s still like a bluesy, sort of Leadbelly riff, isn’t it? And everybody loves a good riff. You branch out from there. But that’s really how our music evolved: out of riffs. They give you like a platform for the scenery you want to paint around it.\n\nTell us about your forthcoming album…\n\nWe’ve got a working title for it, I Will Be Me. I’ve always loved the idea about The Kinks being like misfits; it’s a semi-sub-theme of the album about being an outcast and not fitting in, but celebrating the fact. “Fuck it. I’ll be who I want to be. And that’s who I am, take it or leave it.”\n\nSo it’s kind of got that attitude, which I’ve always liked about the early Kinks’ stuff. I like individuality in music. Those are recurring themes in my music, and the fight for identity, really. It’s always been the subplot of my life! Being 60 and puttin’ your feet up – I mean, what’s that all about?\n\nAVORY NICE GUY\n\nFormer Kinks Mick Avory and John Dalton now regularly tour as The Kast Off Kinks, performing deep cuts and hits from the Ray Davies songbook. Both played a formative role in many of the group’s klassic recordings. In our exclusive interviews, Mick discusses his drumming secrets, John reveals much about his stints in the band\n\nRC: Mick, tell us a bit about your numerous appearances on Saturday Club, which was Brian Matthew’s show, several of which are now featured on The Kinks At The BBC box set.\n\nMick Avory: It was basically done like a gig, rather than a recording session. If there is a mistake, start again, but usually we could get through a track quite well once we got the sound. We’d probably do a whole set of numbers, and then they’d come out and interview the band. We’d always have a single out, so he would say, “Well, this is the latest one,” and play that. It was quite enjoyable, really.\n\nAlso, we used to do The Joe Loss Show. That was at the Playhouse Theatre. It was Ross McManus, Elvis Costello’s dad [who fronted The Joe Loss Orchestra]. They used to do numbers that were currently popular – big-band versions – and the drummer’s name was Kenny Hollick. I used to talk to him. He said, “I’ve got to be Keith Moon this week, because I’m doing a Who number!” I don’t know how many numbers we did, probably two or three. We’d do one at a time. “Here are The Kinks again,” then they’d switch over to the big band, and do a couple of numbers. They were quite good programmes from a listening point of view.\n\nThe BBC sessions are your first professional recordings with The Kinks (earlier recordings featured session drummers at the behest of producer Shel Talmy). The first album that you play drums on all the way through was Face To Face, which was also supposed to have your vocal debut on a song called Lilacs And Daffodils.\n\nYeah. I don’t know what happened to that. It was just an idea that someone threw in, but obviously we didn’t pick it up. But from then on I never sang anything. When it was first mentioned, I wasn’t aware of the song anyway, to be honest. I’d sort of forgotten about it, actually.\n\nWhat did you make of Face To Face?\n\nI liked it, because I was making a debut and getting into the music and trying to do my best to fit around the songs. I wasn’t really a loud rock’n’roll drummer. I could drum songs because I listened to the music. I didn’t just listen to the bass player. A lot of drummers and bass players work together. But I don’t just listen to the rhythmic part; I listen to the vocal as well. But the only trouble is that some of the songs we used to do, we didn’t record the vocal until the end. Ray used to sort of go through all the chords or put the song together and get the arrangement and then go through it. You had to surmise what the vocal was, because we didn’t always get a vocal guide.\n\nIt is one of Ray’s peculiarities that The Kinks did most of their backing tracks without knowing the song’s vocal melody.\n\nHe didn’t want to give a song away. He was a bit secretive about it. But when he loosened up a bit, he gave us a bit better idea. If he’d prewritten the song, that is. Sometimes when you ran through them they weren’t always completed songs. He’d get the idea and put it together in the studio on some songs. We used to do rehearsals during the 60s as well around his house, which was quite a set-up. We used to record stuff that we used to play together, ’cause we used to jam and go in different sequences and rhythms. He used to record it all and he could figure out a certain feel to work into other songs. It sort of made the group more of an integral part of the song, rather than just coming down and playing it. So that was good as well.\n\nWhat was the transition between bassists Pete Quaife and John Dalton like for you as a drummer?\n\nPete played with his fingers and John Dalton plays with a pick. So it’s like a slightly different attack on the notes and the strings. John is probably a bit more rock’n’roll type of player, naturally. Pete used to make up lines derived from little pieces of instrumental [or] classical [music]. He was always playing different little things. John would never do anything like that. He was more straightforward, more proven sort of lines.\n\nThe thing is, when you play together, you get into each other’s groove. You can get a great bass player who comes in and wants to dominate everything then it doesn’t work. John played his part, like Pete did, but in a slightly different way. They were both easy to play with. They’re not complicated.\n\nPete was fond of inserting other melodies into his bass lines. Wicked Annabella for instance (from The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society) features the classical piece, Jesu, Joy Of Man’s Desiring.\n\nHe’d do it tastefully. It would come off. But John was sort of more conventional, with more conventional bass lines. He knew the business and he knew how to play rock’n’roll.\n\nPete was a bit of a strange character. You never quite knew where you were with him. He used to do off-the-wall, strange things. [The first time he quit The Kinks] he broke his foot in the van when he was going home from a gig with the road manager. He didn’t have to leave the band. It seemed to be an excuse for him to leave the band. He just wasn’t happy with it. He went to school with Ray and Dave and had gone through a lot with them already. He’d rather have done something else for a living. But it seemed a strange time to leave, when you’re having that success [Sunny Afternoon was at No 1]. But he did. Then he changed his mind because circumstances changed and he wanted to come back.\n\nBy then I’d gotten used to John Dalton, he was someone I got on quite well with because he was just a basic, regular guy. I sort of tuned into him easier. I got along with Pete, but I couldn’t get close to him because he had these weird things he used to do, sort of a different wavelength to me.\n\nWhen he came back, it was under discussion and it was really Ray and Dave who made the decision: “I liked him, I went to school with him,” etc. All that came into it. They liked him as a bass player, so they got him back. But then he wanted to leave again, so you never knew where you were.\n\nIn addition to your musical exploits, you did some modelling during the late 60s.\n\nMichael McGrath used to do the publicity for John Stephen [a fashion designer, known as “The King of Carnaby Street”], and he was a friend of the band. He got me into modelling with these girls that he used to get around his flat and took some pictures. They used to dress me up in all these costumes that were the last thing I’d ever wear! I used to wear them in publicity. There was a centrespread in the Daily Mirror. That was the biggest thing, really, apart from the music magazines. That was the most “fashion” thing I did. But it was only really a one-off thing.\n\nWhat did you make of the change in the albums, like Something Else in 1967?\n\nIt was progression to me, because it was all original songs. We’d played as a band for a while and got more decent. But I think the Village Green Preservation Society was really a landmark because it was the first theme album we did, with a story running through it. It didn’t do much at the time, but over the years on it became a top album, I believe. I still play some of those songs now – a bit better than I did then, hopefully!\n\nYou were limited at the time technology-wise, having to do lots of bounce downs to get the increasingly sophisticated productions that Ray conceived on tape. Your drum track tended to be at the bottom of those mixes, because it was the first item taped.\n\nYeah, they’d get smothered with overdubs. Ray didn’t always bring his voice forward either. He used to bury his voice sometimes, because he’s an artist and he would be involved with every bit of it. It goes on moods and emotions more with an artist. A producer sees it from a different angle. He sees it as a piece of music that he’d like to listen to on the radio. When it’s so personal, it depends on what mood Ray was in, whether the vocal was [mixed] up or down. It’s understandable. It’s just the way things are if you’re that involved with it.\n\nYou do some interesting things with the drums, like on Wicked Annabella you play with your snare turned off.\n\nYeah, I took the snare off just to get a different sound. I did that on Picture Book too. If you play with a band, you can imagine the sound that you want, even if it doesn’t ever really make perfect records, but it gets the feel right. In recording you can muck about with anything like that just to get a different sound, something that suits the track.\n\nI’ve done all sorts of things. I put newspaper over a floor tom-tom in Phenomenal Cat. Just got a deader sound, but it sounded right. Anything goes in the studio. When you’re in a band like The Kinks, there’s so many different styles of songs and things you can do that it made you try to expand your thinking a bit, which is good. You can turn the stick around the other way; you can do all sorts of things you can do if it fits the track. You have to work out what the best thing is for that track. It takes a little bit of experimentation, but when you hear it back, you can tell. When they start recording, they get the sounds together and say, “Well, come and hear it,” and then you can pick it to pieces. “No, I shouldn’t play that there. I’ll leave that out there, but I could do that there – arrange the drums yourself, because you know what fits by then.\n\nDid Ray instruct you much on what he wanted or did you have to interpret his ideas telepathically?\n\nHe had a fixed thing in his head. But a lot of the time not much of the song was written. Something like Apeman, the drum bits – he wrote that – it was part of the arrangement. You would do play it that way because it’s written into the song. But other times you can put miscellaneous embellishments in, just something that you like doing and think, “I’m quite happy with it,” and no one says, ‘No, don’t do that,” it stays. It can be either.\n\nArthur was the last record that you recorded at Pye Studios. By then you had eight-track recordings, so your drums were at last on their own separate track.\n\nI like that album, because the songs weren’t one rhythm all the way through. There were different parts to it which was new to me. Shangri-La is broken up in different ways. There are little pieces where there are rolls where you slow down a bit and come back. That is John Dalton’s favourite Kinks’ track.\n\nWhat was it like when The Kinks opened Konk?\n\nIt used to be a tobacco warehouse and everything’s on different levels and different little nooks and crannies and steps up. So we picked the biggest space at the studio and built it from there. It wasn’t all done together. It was gradual. Then we got a proper control room made by these acoustic specialists and they came in and they put one in down the other end to the one we had to begin with. That was exciting because we could do more things. But inevitably it took more time because we had our own studio. You could experiment more. Things took a bit too long sometimes, but there again, we did have a bar, so it wasn’t that bad.\n\nDid the commercial success of the records mean that much to you, or were you just happy to play? Your mid-70s run of concept albums is still misunderstood and underappreciated.\n\nIt was quite fun to do and Ray always does stuff with some humorous aspect to it. It’s something he wanted to do; it was a vehicle for his writing at the time. He didn’t view it as a separate thing from The Kinks. He involved the band with it.\n\nBut when it got to Schoolboys In Disgrace, I think the album was more of a proper album than bits and pieces of proper songs that followed the theme. It was more of a group album, and we went back to doing band albums.\n\nWhen we signed with Arista, of course, Clive Davis wanted us in the big places, the arenas and the big stadiums, but we couldn’t do it with that type of act. We had to beef it up a bit. So Ray started writing Give The People What They Want. It was a bit punky, some of it, but it worked in the big halls. When we did the US Festival [a huge 1982 outdoor concert in California] and all the bands on it would go off with a big blast and do a real hard number to kick off, Ray went out there and did Art Lover. No other band in the world would get away with that: the quietest song he could possibly do.\n\nONE OF THE SURVIVORS\n\nJohn Dalton was twice a Kink: for a short stint at the height of their fame in 1966 and again from 1969-76\n\nRC: You joined The Kinks when Sunny Afternoon was at No 1…\n\nJohn Dalton: That’s right, yeah. I’d done my audition in ’66 – if you can call it an audition. I didn’t know any of The Kinks. If I was looking at a photo of The Kinks, I didn’t know who was Ray Davies, Mick Avory [or] Dave Davies. I had no idea at all. So it was a bit awkward. And that same night, after I went for my audition, they asked me to do Top Of The Pops with Sunny Afternoon. And I hadn’t heard it before then. It was my first introduction to The Kinks. Very nerve-wracking.\n\nWhat was your first studio experience with The Kinks?\n\nRay was in the process of getting rid of Shel Talmy and starting producing us himself. That’s why we’d done two versions of Dead End Street. The first one was with Shel Talmy producing and with Pete Quaife [on bass]. And then we crept in the studio at midnight and re-recorded it the way Ray wanted it. And I was bass player on it. And I had done a couple of tracks for Face To Face, but I think they made one the B-side of Dead End Street [Big Black Smoke] instead of putting it on the album.\n\nFor the Deluxe Edition of Face To Face I used your acetate of Dead End Street for the bonus track version.\n\nThat’s right, yeah. Yeah. I’ve got both acetates because Ray gave me the first one to listen to. It was great for me ’cos I knew exactly what I could do. I recorded Little Miss Queen Of Darkness, which was on the Face To Face album. And I did record Big Black Smoke as well, but I thought that was for the album, but they must have kept it back for the B-side of Dead End Street.\n\nPete Quaife returned to the fold shortly thereafter; he’d had a long history with Dave and Ray even before Mick was in the band. Nevertheless, he left again at the time of Plastic Man and you were suddenly back in The Kinks. Were you surprised?\n\nOh, very surprised. Mick suddenly phoned me up. Because the true story is, in ’66, after about a month or so, Pete decided officially to quit the band, and so they asked me to join full-time. But then he decided to come back. Management said, “There’s not much we can do about it, because he is a quarter of Kinks Productions.” They can’t say no to him, because he’s part of the company. So that’s when I had to go.\n\nI went over the phonecall again. They said, “Pete’s definitely left this time.” I did say to Mick, well, to be quite honest, I had a good day job and I was also playing in a local band weekends, which was good fun. I had a son, so there was a baby about. My first reaction to Mick was, “I think I’m all right, Mick.” I think he was quite shocked. Let’s face it: most people would jump at it, wouldn’t they? It was one of the biggest bands. I suppose I’d been let down once and I didn’t want it to happen again. But he got back to Ray, and Ray said, well, obviously, our money’s gone up since the last time John was in the band, plus we’ll make him a quarter of the company, so he’s got something. They never did, but they promised me!\n\nAs I returned, they were negotiating going back to America. For me, who had never been to America, that was wonderful. Also, in 1970, they decided to add a keyboardist to the shows, which was going to make so much difference. When we brought John Gosling – John The Baptist – on keyboards, that sort of really filled us out. Everybody was getting on well. We were very, very friendly. I was bringing up a family exactly the same time as Dave; we seemed to have children the same age. When we went away [on tour], my wife and all the kids went over and stayed over with his wife, Lisbet. Ray played for my local football team. Everybody was really getting on well together then. It really was good.\n\nLola (June ’70) brought The Kinks back commercially.\n\nYeah, Lola resurrected us a bit. We’d gone a bit quiet. If people don’t see you on TV and no one’s playing your records, they think you’re not a band anymore. Then we come crashing back with Lola. Ray, being Ray, had just written about something that people didn’t really want to talk about: transvestites!\n\nFollowing the Lola album, you guys worked on the soundtrack for the film Percy, which had your one vocal track for The Kinks: Willesden Green.\n\nWhen they got a scene in a pub, Willesden Green was playing. That was the idea. It’s just a wonder that Ray let me sing because he’s never let anybody apart from Dave sing in the band, ever. Not on a record.\n\nI’m still getting requests for that. I don’t do it now. I just been up in Scotland on tour and people were asking, “Do Willesden Green.” So I just sang it in private to them!\n\nHow would Ray present his new songs to you? Would he play them for you or demo them up?\n\nRay’s always been the same. In the early days, I can remember going in and we laid a track down at Studio 1, and I had no idea what it was. I wrote down the chords, played the bassline. He didn’t sing any vocals to it at all, so I just laid the thing down. He normally played piano and we would just work around that. Dave was always lucky because he would just lay [his part] playing normal guitar, and he would take it away, obviously, because he’s got to do solos and that. He could work on his part and then rerecord it.\n\nI always told people that half of the time [we’d] start recording a song [at] Take One, we run through it. Now, you think there’s nothing wrong with it. Then Ray would go, “Do it again.” “Oh. All right, then.” And then 40 takes later, Ray will say, “Will you play back the first one again?… That’s the one.” Because you’ve got the energy and everybody there’s getting fed up going for the same chord sequence for hours and hours. You play back the first, because you’ve got a lot of nervous tension there when you record. It’s got that little bit of magic to it. It happened many times.\n\nWhen you left The Kinks in 1976, was it a tough decision?\n\nVery hard. You’re actually leaving one of the top bands. We spent a lot of time in America, not as much as we should, though, really. But we spent a lot of time out there. I had three children by then – a wife and three kids – and I just missed them and missed my home. And I just wasn’t reaping the benefits of being away all the time. You’ve got to get something out of it if you’re just not at home. I think most of the tours were about 12 weeks.\n\nBy then, The Kinks had opened a recording studio, so you were probably spending even more time in the studio than normal, because you weren’t watching the clock.\n\nIn Ray’s mind, I suppose, there was no rush, was there? So an album could take ages, because there’s not someone else coming into the studio at 12 o’clock. There’s not someone who has booked it on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week. It’s your studio. You can do what you like. We spent a lot of time in there. Luckily we’d built a bar. We put a bar in there and a snooker table, dartboard. So when Ray was just mixing, we’d play snooker and darts and drink.\n\nAndrew Sandoval wishes to thank Chris Metzler, Cory Frye, Mark Easter and of course The Kinks for their invaluable help in making these interviews possible.
