        "text": "It can be easy to assume that The Kinks were just a British rock band who didn’t make it quite as big as The Beatles and were pipped to the post of Kings Of Concept Albums by The Who. It’s an easy assumption and completely wrong, ignoring that The Kinks did something completely different to all their competition: at their best, they were a great rock band who captured the blandness of suburbia and the stupidity of the spoiled. They were the Gilbert & Sullivan of 20th century Britain, writers of weird little operettas of human folly.\n\nNobody captured the faux-urbanity of the English middle classes the way The Kinks did: their music is a perfect snapshot of the charm, inconsistencies and foibles of 20th-century England, able to do sweeping and epic as easily as they could perfect, potted vignettes. They are monarchs of a certain type of British sensibility: the ability to both love, and critique, the things that make us as a nation.\n\nWe at GQ have been taking a look at the artists who deserve a retread from isolation: from folk icons such as Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez to the genius of Ray Charles and the underestimated hits of Fleetwood Mac and Blondie. This week we’ll be looking at some of our favourite Kinks songs to give you a broad swath of what it is we love about them, a taster before you, invariably, are inspired to begin a longer deep dive.\n\n1. ‘You Really Got Me’ (from The Kinks)\n\nThe Kinks’ first album is just pure, delightful rock’n’roll, full of sex and Americana in a way that slowly vanishes with each passing album until they’re about as English as class warfare. There are a few standouts on the album, including the very upbeat, very crisp and clean, “I Took My Baby Home”. But The Kinks’ first smash hit single really is impossible to beat: from the opening guitar to the confused awkwardness of Ray Davies’ vocals, who seems taken aback by his ability to become obsessed, slowly building into full blown lust.\n\n2. 'Nothin' In The World Can Stop Me Worryin' ‘Bout That Girl’ (from Kinda Kinks)\n\nThere’s a lot of good stuff on The Kinks’ sophomore album: there’s vestiges of the first album’s rock, such as “Come On Now”, and the brilliant “Tired Of Waiting For You”, so lethargic and overheated that it might as well be a Tennessee Williams play. But perhaps most unusual, and yet most indicative of a certain strain of the way The Kinks can subvert and twist traditional musical forms to make contemporary statements, is “Nothin’ In The World Can Stop Me Worryin’ ‘Bout That Girl”. Part Nick Drake, part bossa nova shuffle, it sells the main character's paranoia about their flighty, unfaithful girlfriend as a kind of border ballad. You almost expect someone to cut out someone’s heart before hanging themselves in the final verse.\n\n3. ‘A Well Respected Man’ (from Kwyet Kinks)\n\nThere are two songs that mark the transformation of The Kinks: “Dedicated Follower Of Fashion”, a standalone single released in 1966 that mocked mod culture, and 1965’s “A Well Respected Man”, a searing takedown of upper-class smarminess. “A Well Respected Man” is both the first of these two game-changing singles and also, arguably, the one that casts a wider and more important net of criticism. \"And he plays at stocks and shares / And he goes to the regatta / And he adores the girl next door / Cause hes dying to get at her,” is an absolutely perfect verse, made all the better by the way Ray sings “regatta” – you can feel the venom and how undeniably accurate it is in portraying a certain type of man that is still on the same train every time in 2020.\n\n4. ‘Big Black Smoke’ (from Face To Face)\n\nFace To Face from 1966 feels like the moment something changed for The Kinks: almost entirely written by Ray Davies, who had a nervous breakdown just before they went into record, the album is much softer and more anglicised than the albums that come before it. It’s often described as a concept album, in part because it is filled with very acerbic, well-observed character studies of those who have (“Sunny Afternoon”) and those who don’t (“Dead End Street”, originally a single that’s been added into later reissues). But \"Big Black Smoke” – cut from the original album, perhaps in part because Pye Records wanted to quash Ray Davies’ use of sound effects to connect the songs – is just such an odd, brilliant song. It’s bluegrass, it’s Threepenny Opera, but it’s also a distinctly English song about disenfranchised rural youths escaping to the city. It is so deeply macabre, and they’re having so much fun with it, that it’s a real sign of what’s to come.\n\n5. ‘Two Sisters’ (from Something Else)\n\nThe album that marked Ray Davies taking over on production from Shel Talmy, you can really feel The Kinks' signature sound on here: a sort of brassier, more rotund and red-nosed version of the big, sweeping sounds you hear from other bands in the mid-to-late 1960s. It was recorded during the conception of Ray Davies’ “Village Green Project”, which you see more of in the next album.\n\nOn the album that gave us “Waterloo Sunset”, it’s the biting satire of its other tracks that deserves to be delved into. Something Else is often lauded for its baroque elements, and “Two Sisters” gives you those in spades. It’s a perfect short story, in which Percilla laments her mundane, married life and wishes he was more like her sister, Sylvilla, only to come to find triumph in the children she has created and raised. Davies is great at observation, but here that turns into something even greater: empathy.\n\n6. ‘Autumn Almanac’ (from Something Else)\n\nIncluded on the 1998 and 2004 reissues of Something Else, “Autumn Almanac” was released as a single between that and Village Green Preservation Society. Described as a “phenomenal recording” by Dave Davies, Ray’s composition is such a perfect analysis of kitsch suburban Britain that it’s almost uncomfortable to listen to, made all the more jarring by its lush, vaudevillian score. Capturing a truculent and melancholy man mourning the summer’s passing and his small world, the verse “I like my football on a Saturday / Roast beef on Sundays, all right / I go to Blackpool for my holidays / Sit in the open sunlight” is an otherworldly microcosm of a certain type of Englishness. It’s antiquated and yet fresh and has that strange sort of found-object-psychadelia that Peter Blake and Terry Gilliam captured so perfectly in their work.\n\n7. ‘The Village Green Preservation Society’ (from The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society)\n\nIf you want to picture a perfect day in British music, it is perhaps the day this album – and The Beatles' White Album – were released on November 22 1968. A commercial failure, it was described by Davies as \"the most successful ever flop”. It is England’s Under Milk Wood, a perfect bucolic concept album, a saucy postcard with a sad message on the back. If there’s an album that deserves listen after listen after listen it’s this one.\n\nIf the album is a matryoshka of delights, then its title song is a masterpiece of irony, reference and symbolism. From the moment it begins, the Greek chorus of the preservation society, here to preserve the finest parts of English culture, lists American characters (“Donald Duck”), derisive generalisations (“strawberry jam, and all the different varieties”), alter egos opposing urbanisation such as the “Office Block Persecution Affinity”, and – perhaps its darkest and yet most hidden punchline – “virginity”. There's a reason Kate Rusby’s cover soundtracked the WI parody sitcom Jam & Jerusalem in 2006: no village institution survives this song in tact and yet there is no more loving tribute to rural morality.\n\n8. ‘Rosemary Rose’ (from The Great Lost Kinks Album)\n\nWhat sounds like a treat for fans is anything but: master tapes had been shipped by the band to Reprise Records as part of contractual obligations and had been intended as “collateral” for the label. The band only found out about this album's release when they saw it charting and legal action meant the album was discontinued two years after release (most of these songs are now included in the 1998 reissues of The Kinks’ discography). While there are tons of goodies to be found among them tracks, “Rosemary Rose” is a real joy.\n\nThe first verse starts off so conventional – \"Rosemary Rose / Nature sure gave you such a beautiful nose\" – and then subverts it immediately: \"'Though you're not beautiful as someone would know / That Rosemary Rose.\" It starts off like a cover of a Restoration ballad and then descends into a strange, oddly sinister look at obsession and desperation. Nobody gets to be loved in a Kinks song if they can help it.\n\n9. ‘Australia' (from Arthur)\n\nArthur, often rightly praised as one of the great concept albums, was originally intended to be used in a Granada television play about a carpet layer. You can feel the operatic quality to what The Kinks do here more than anywhere else: down to song names such as “She’s Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina”, which falls into the sort of nomenclature you might expect for an aria or a sonnet rather than a rock song.\n\n“Australia” doesn’t really go anywhere – though, then again, The Kinks do atmosphere just as well as they do narrative – and to see it written down on the page it just seems camp and knowingly tacky. But there are few songs that do so well at showing the unravelling of a dream as “Australia”: from cowabunga dreamscape (“We'll surf like they do in the USA”) to the very collapse of the utopia it describes as the song descends into a perfectly ordered mess. It’s one of the loosest, most overtly surreal songs The Kinks ever did.\n\n10. ‘Shangri La’ (from Arthur)\n\nIt’s hard not to keep referring back to some of the great poets of Englishness (or, indeed, wider Britishness) when talking about The Kinks. Their focus on microscopic analyses of our nation’s best and worst qualities doesn’t make for stadium anthems and immortal singalongs, but it does make for work that deserves to be held next to Rudyard Kipling or John Betjeman and “Shangri La” is one of the songs that deserves that comparison most.\n\nInspired by Ray and Dave visiting their sister, Rose, after she moved with her husband to a designed community in Adelaide, it does what The Kinks do – and Arthur does over and over again – best. It takes the idea of a particular idyll, the “Shangri La” of the comfortable atomic family in a comfortable house, and explodes it for the hypocrisy and insecurity at its core. \"They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go / They tell your business in another Shangri-la” is such a perfect description of suburban mundanity that it beggars belief.\n\n11. ‘Lola’ (from Lola Versus Powerman)\n\nLola Versus Powerman was that rare thing for The Kinks: a great album that managed to be a commercial success. The album is full of corkers – “Strangers”, “Powerman”, but there's a reason “Lola” has become one of The Kinks' best known songs: it is, simply put, a piece of musical genius. It's not just catchy and simply written enough to be a truly great singalong (which is rare in the eloquent world of The Kinks), but it's also an incredibly clever song: layered yet economical, it is full of ideas of masculinity, sexuality, fluidity. Regardless of how Lola might identify now – drag queen? Transgender woman? Nonbinary club kid? – the song's compassion for all its characters means it has a Twelfth Night-ish quality: a dreamy and timeless look at human complexity.\n\n12. ‘The Way Love Used To Be’ (from Percy)\n\nThe soundtrack to the British comedy of the same name about penis transplants, this Kinks album produced some belters. Perhaps the most out there for them – and one of their most beautiful songs – is “The Way Love Used To Be”. The Kinks loved songs about dreams of a better place and this is a perfect example. It’s also one of the few instances when the romance central to the song isn’t at all complicated or difficult: unlike the crumbling love stories of many of their best songs, here the lovers want to escape together to somewhere in solitude just to find love and peace.\n\n13. ‘Here Come The People In Grey’ (from Muswell Hillbillies)\n\nMuswell Hillbillies, probably the last England-under-the-microscope album The Kinks' produced, was a commercial failure but a critical darling (which is something you can apply to pretty much every one of The Kinks’ greatest albums). After the deeply English soundscapes of the last few albums, Muswell Hillbillies toys with the formula by mixing assessments of our fellow countrymen with the sounds of bluegrass. There are wistful portraits of small dreams in songs such as “Oklahoma USA”, and there’s the dyspeptic noir of “Holloway Jail”, but “Here Come The People In Grey” is a particularly interesting use of the album’s style: what starts as the story of a man suffering under the thumb of modern Britain when a borough surveyor takes away his home turns into a political piece as he moves off the grid with his girlfriend and says, “We’re gonna buy me gun to keep the policemen away.” It is a strange look at how American individualism could sound coming from a very ordinary English man and it’s this dissonance of two cultures clashing that makes this song so interesting.\n\n14. ‘Supersonic Rocket Ship’ (from Everybody’s In Show-Biz)\n\nThis 1972 album is seen as the moment Davies dived even deeper into vaudeville and music hall as inspirations. It’s campy, it’s oddly glam, it’s no less forensic about the human condition, but it's perhaps the least interesting psychological study the band offer, considering that we’re not at any loss for songs about how hard it is to be famous. “Celluloid Heroes”, perhaps oddly for a closing track, feels like the opening of a brilliant musical, but is triter than much of their best work (the 2009 version with the Crouch End Choir is probably better than the album one, for our money.) There are some great pantomime character studies such as “Maximum Consumption”, on here, but the album’s most famous song is also, probably, its most interesting look at the pitfalls of fame. “Supersonic Rocket Ship” offers a utopian escape from the pretences and struggles of modern society that Davies spends so much of his music lampooning, again playing with calypso and reggae beats in a way that feels a little bit less awkward than his dubious accent on “Apeman”.\n\n15. ‘Sweet Lady Genevieve’ (from Preservation Act 1)\n\nDavies did a two-part rock opera for The Kinks’ next two albums and… well, they aren’t well remembered: both parts one and two not only sold poorly, but they were also slated by critics, a hellish combo the band largely avoided up until now. “Sweet Lady Genevieve”, however, a song performed to an estranged former lover, is often seen as the one shining gem from a difficult time in The Kinks’ musical output. Does it sound a bit like The Beatles’ “Buffalo Bill”? Absolutely! But it’s a beautiful transcontinental romantic rock song and a sign of the solid gold nuggets even The Kinks’ worst albums could contain.\n\n16. ‘Juke Box Music’ (from Sleepwalker)\n\nThe Kinks released albums well into the 1990s, but by the time we get to Sleepwalker, you've probably heard the best and most interesting stuff the band ever put out. There are still some gems left, though, including this album's “Juke Box Music”: back to full blown American rock‘n’roll again, it takes a fresh long at the daydreaming young women so prevalent in the genre: while this woman is obsessed with the romance and heightened emotions of music, it leads to everyone else wondering why she distances herself from reality. Even here, in a song that feels like very old-school Kinks, they manage to do something fresh thanks to Davies' idiosyncratic look at the world.\n\nHead to GQ's Vero channel for exclusive music content and commentary, all the latest music lifestyle news and insider access into the GQ world, from behind-the-scenes insight to recommendations from our editors and high-profile talent.\n\nNow read\n\nThe 14 songs that prove Joni Mitchell's genius\n\nTen Blondie songs that changed new wave\n\nThe best Fleetwood Mac songs after Rumours"
