        "text": "In 2019, Taylor Swift released the upbeat pop song “London Boy.” Five years later, she’s saying “so long” to the city with her new song “So Long London.”\n\nBoth “London Boy” and “So Long London” are the fifth songs of their respective albums: “Lover” and “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\n“London Boy” was widely received as an ode to her then-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. She and the English actor split in the spring of 2023 after six years together.\n\nRevisit our live coverage of the release of “The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\nIn “So Long London,” she appears to be saying goodbye to the city, and the relationship that put her there. Or, as the Brits might say, “Ta ta for now.”\n\nLike much of “The Tortured Poets Department,” “So Long London” is a melancholy song of heartbreak.\n\nShe captures a picture of a relationship in its final moments, with one person drifting away and another exerting themselves to keep the pair together. Or, as she puts it, “carrying the rift.”\n\nThe relationship is no longer like the joyful jaunt she describes in “London Boy,” through neighborhoods like SoHo. Instead, it’s a tough climb up a hill. Trying to “(pull) him in tighter each time he was drifting away” is taking a toll. The narrator describes the effect all that effort has on her body. She has a “split spine” and “weary bones.”\n\nSoon, the person who is trying stops and allows the distance to grow: “I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe.” The safe could be a metaphor for a closed-off person.\n\nUltimately, she gives up on the relationship, using medical language to essentially declare it dead. “I stopped CPR, after all it’s no use / The spirit was gone, we would never come to,” she sings.\n\nHer words here echo “You’re Losing Me“ from her previous album, “Midnights.” Fans interpreted that song to be about her breakup with Alwyn: “I can’t find a pulse / My heart won’t start anymore for you.”\n\nThe song also gives the perspective of onlookers and the other person in the relationship. Her friends say “It isn’t right to be scared,” in a relationship.\n\nThe man blames her, saying she “abandoned the ship.” She has another take: “I was going down with it / My white knuckle dying grip holding tight to your quiet resentment.”\n\nIn the end, comes the relationship post-mortem when she reflects on what happened, what went wrong — and how she feels now.\n\nShe looked for “clues” to support his claims that he loved her. Instead, she only felt uncertain about the commitment: “Every breath feels like rarest air / When you’re not sure if he wants to be there.”\n\nAfter dealing with this person’s blues, she’s feeling like herself again: “You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days / And I’m just getting color back into my face.” (In \"You'e Losing Me,\" she sings, \"My face was gray.\")\n\nThe song concludes with Swift going home with a feeling of resignation. She’s not “the one,” but the other person will “find someone.”\n\nPeople drift apart; that doesn’t mean the other person isn’t worthy of love. The only thing she’s “pissed off” about? “You let me give you all that youth for free.” It’s worth noting Swift and Alwyn were together from when she was 27 to 33.\n\nThis clearly isn’t the bop that “London Boy” is, but they do share some lyrical overlap.\n\nIn “London Boy,” she mashes up her country music roots with England, calling herself a “Tennessee Stella McCartney on the heath.”\n\nShe mentions heaths again here but in the context of endings. “I left all I knew / You left me at the house by the heath,” she sings. Heaths are a rare lowland habitat found in the U.K. and elsewhere in northwest Europe.\n\nRead the lyrics to ‘So Long London’\n\nI saw in my mind ferry lights through the mist\n\nI kept calm and carried the weight of the rift\n\nPulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away\n\nMy spine split from carrying us up the hill\n\nWet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill\n\nI stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe\n\nThinking how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me?\n\nOh the tragedy.\n\nSo long London.\n\nYou’ll find someone.\n\nI didn’t opt in to be your odd man out\n\nI founded the club she’s heard great things about\n\nI left all I knew you left me at the house by the Heath\n\nI stopped CPR, after all it’s no use\n\nThe spirit was gone, we would never come to\n\nAnd I’m pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free\n\nFor so long, London\n\nStitches undone\n\nTwo graves, one gun\n\nI’ll find someone\n\nAnd you say I abandoned the ship, but I was going down with it\n\nMy white knuckle dying grip holding tight to your quiet resentment\n\nAnd my friends said it isn’t right to be scared\n\nEvery day old love affair,\n\nEvery breath feels like rarest air\n\nWhen you’re not sure if he wants to be there\n\nSo how much sad did you think I had, did you think I had in me?\n\nHow much tragedy?\n\nJust how low did you think I’d go ‘fore I’d self implode?\n\n‘Fore I’d have to go be free?\n\nYou swore that you loved, me but where were the clues?\n\nI died on the altar waiting for the proof\n\nYou sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days\n\nAnd I’m just getting color back into my face\n\nI’m just mad as hell cause I loved this place for\n\nSo long, London\n\nHad a good run\n\nA moment of warm sun\n\nBut I’m not the one\n\nSo long, London\n\nStitches undone\n\nTwo graves, one gun\n\nYou’ll find someone"
