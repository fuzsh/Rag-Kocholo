        "text": "20 See, for example, the following quotations from a relatively early study of rock, Richard Middleton's Pop Music and the Blues (London, 1972). The blues is defined as the place to find black identity, both communal and individual (pp. 27, 49, etc.), and from this Middleton extrapolates about pop: ‘The pop singer's naivety, and the resulting lack of a gulf between him and his audience, is an important part of his appeal. He is the “boy next door”, just as the town blues singer is the representative of his people's experience … The relationship between the community and the individual is centred in the pop singer. Like the town bluesman, he represents the community because of his role and aura (image), and he thus distils its experience as well as his own … He is universal (the “boy next door”) and unique (the pinpoint of teenage aspiration)‘ (p. 132).Google Scholar\n\n22 Cynics such as Adorno were terrified by the individuality apparently sacrificed in this sort of listening experience in popular musics. For him, the process of identification in pop-music consumption was artificially created – resulting entirely from capitalist manipulation. Such scepticism is the other extreme to the assumption that all rock music is entirely sincere. By now, countless writers have addressed this issue; it was a burning question during the early years of rock musicology. See, for example, Middleton, Studying Popular Music, Chapter 2; Simon Frith, The Sociology of Rock (London, 1978); Dick Hebdige, Subculture: The Meaning of Style (London, 1979); Antoine Hennion, ‘The Production of Success: An Anti-Musicology of the Pop Song’, Popular Music, 3 (1983), 159–93, reprinted slightly abridged in On Record: Rock, Pop, and the Written Word, ed. Simon Frith and Andrew Goodwin (London, 1990), 185–206. It seems clear that all of this music is a balance between manipulation and ‘artistry’, between record-industry control and consumer choice, and between mediation and directness. Reception patterns, too, are partly determined by industry manipulation, but rely heavily on factors out of industry control, and it is quite possible to suspend one's disbelief during a ‘communal’ listening experience without sacrificing one's knowledge or individual subjectivity in the long run.Google Scholar\n\n23 It was not until Beatlemania that people really began to differentiate between group members. Earlier, either one personality was clearly the ‘lead singer’ and the others backup support whose ‘personae’ were grafted onto that lead singer, or else the whole group had a collective persona. Even with the Beatles, the collective mop-cut beast was usually a single persona when the group sang. Or, conversely, fans who longed passionately for, say, Paul McCartney felt that specifically he was singing to them when he crooned, and the other Beatles fell away. (Frith makes this point as well – see Performing Rites, 201.) In general, I feel that the single protagonist-composer model is applicable to the Beatles' output, at least until their later work. For an investigation of this persona, and then a rereading offering a darker view of the protagonist-composer of two early Beatles songs by John Lennon, see Daniel Beller-McKenna, ‘Beatle-John's “Alter Ego”‘, Music and Letters, 80 (1999), 254–68.Google Scholar\n\n25 Some recent analysis of gospel music has focused on dialogical readings, building on the principle of ‘signifyin(g)’ – a term honed by Henry Louis Gates, Jr, to capture the tendency toward intertextual reference (homage, pastiche, one-upmanship, etc.) characteristic of much African-American expressive culture (see his The Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African-American Literary Criticism, New York, 1988). The term has been transferred to musical analysis by Samuel A. Floyd, Jr, in ‘Ring Shout! Literary Studies, Historical Studies, and Black Music Inquiry’, Black Music Research Journal, 11 (1991), 265–87. (See also the application of these ideas in David Brackett, Interpreting Popular Music, paperback edn with new preface, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000, Chapter 4.) For Gates and Floyd, signifyin(g) musically or orally can take forms running all the way from audience ‘shouting’ and ‘testifying’ during a gospel performance to rapping, jazz improvisation or ‘playing the dozens’ (p. 271). Obviously, ‘signifyin(g)’ is an extremely broad concept (at times almost too broad to retain coherent meaning across divergent aspects of performance). Several factors suggest that call-and-response, ‘shouting’ and ‘testifying’ among gospel performers and audience members are, in general, more unifying communal activities than many other aspects that have been classified as signifyin(g). For example, Tony Heilbut's The Gospel Sound: Good News in Bad Times (New York, 1971) contains several quotations from singers and the gospel community (e.g., ‘In church we ain't ashamed to be real’, p. 15) and Heilbut responds with a typical critical reading suggesting lack of mediation: ‘But the most universal approval comes for honesty of emotion … The character is never in doubt; gospel singers look the part … Gospel singers need an audience that shares their feelings and acknowledges their efforts at self-expression … Gospel audiences also respond as one to their music … the church may shudder and roar as one, “Whoo,” “Hah,” “Yessir,” “My Lord My Lord.” … It's this feeling of a community caught up in the spiritual moment that turns gospel into a “foretaste of glory”’ (pp. 11–18). For a specific analysis of some gospel music as individual voices subsumed into a communal experience, see Marks, Morton, ‘“You Can't Sing Unless You're Saved”: Reliving the Call in Gospel Music’, African Religious Groups and Beliefs: Papers in Honor of William R. Bascom, ed. Simon Ottenberg (Meerut, India, 1982), 305–31.Google Scholar\n\n38 Frith, ‘The Sociology of Rock’, 152. Like Frith and Middleton, David Brackett has recently reproblematized the idea of authorship in all forms of popular music, making it one of the central themes of his recent book Interpreting Popular Music (see esp. pp. 2, 14–17). His chapters on Billie Holiday, Bing Crosby, Hank Williams and James Brown focus partly on how images of these stars' authenticity were constructed by different audiences. For my purposes, Brackett's consideration of personae in these cases does not seem to contradict the possibility of reading songs as emanating from a single protagonist (or the fact that it was a historical trend to read them in this way). For example, Brackett's discussion of the ‘multiple voices’ in country music (p. 106) is interesting; but hearing ‘Desire’ in ‘songs of Loss’, or vice versa, because of Hank Williams's individual performances does not undermine the centrality of Williams as protagonist-composer. Loss and desire here are intermingled aspects of the same persona, conflicted elements that make Williams ‘authentic’ as a single individual who feels complex and ambivalent emotions. In other words, the different ‘voices’ emanate from the same persona – a persona that generates both the words and the way in which they are framed, creating an overall state of mind (Brackett does not distinguish between voice and persona). It is only when Brackett approaches Elvis Costello in his last chapter that he invokes the idea of multiple and fractured personae within a song, ‘confusing the sense of “who” is speaking’ (pp. 170–1). Costello, of course, comes from the post-punk period in which many performers and audiences began to experiment with different paradigms for persona construction and reception; this is a good ten years after the Kinks' music I will discuss.Google Scholar\n\n39 One of the most important considerations here is the widening of styles resulting from the split between so-called ‘pop’ and ‘rock’ music during the mid-1960s (though elements of the distinction stretch back to the late 1950s). Strikingly, elements of the early-rock model survived in both the newer categories, which were entrenched by the mid–late sixties; but complications arose as well with both rock and pop. In ‘rock’ music, the visual and textural elements of the early model were challenged. Meanwhile, ‘pop’ preserved more of the early model in terms of presentation, but raised other questions. For example, ‘pop’ musicians generally did not write their own music and often did not play their own instruments, both of which rock musicians did do. With pop, then, there is the potential for a definite layering of voices, with producer, performer, instrumentalist and composer all surfacing at different times or simultaneously. An early example is Phil Spector's work with ‘girl groups’ in the early–mid 1960s. The lyrics and the texture of such hits as the Ronettes' ‘Be my Baby’ or ‘Baby, I Love You’ (both 1963), for example, reinforce – even take to the extreme – the image of the sincere protagonist-as-spontaneous-composer persona. On the other hand, Spector, who both wrote and produced the songs, himself developed a strong musical persona – to the point where people often fail to remember which of his groups (the Crystals, the Ronettes, etc.) sang a particular hit. Pop, then, seems to offer a wider discrepancy between possible reading modes. Perhaps the joy in mature listening comes from balancing the suspension of disbelief (that comes from identifying with the protagonist-composer) with a broader picture that recognizes the producer's mediating persona.Google Scholar\n\nBarbara Bradby has offered a very different reading of the girl-group songs (‘Do-Talk and Don't-Talk: The Division of the Subject in Girl-Group Music’, On Record, ed. Frith and Goodwin, 341–68). Bradby sees the subject (i.e. the protagonist within the song) in girl-group music as significantly less unified than that in male doo-wop, pop and rock of the time, and believes it is an error to presume that these songs emanate from a single subject, even when disregarding questions about producers and writers (pp. 346, 358–65). While I find her methodology original and provocative, I am not convinced, for example, that the chorus repeating ‘You're gonna want me for your girl’ in the fadeout of the Chiffons' ‘One Fine Day’ ‘makes a mockery of the intended sense of the line as sung by the lead singer, which envisages a time when the boy will want to stop running around with other girls and settle down with her’ (p. 361). Granted, the other singers often act as an ‘audience’ in this and other girl-group songs, but that does not undermine their fundamental fusion with the ‘protagonist’. When Bradby argues that the ‘lead’ singer is often eclipsed by the other vocalists in girl-group music, I would draw the opposite conclusion to hers: namely, that the subject is even more ‘universal’ and unified, if often ambivalent or internally torn by a romantic longing or a difficult decision. This can be supported by Bradby's own argument that the group vocals often underline uncertainty in the words (pp. 361–2); in other words, these ‘voices’ cause no friction with received models when read as uncertainty (and there does seem to be more of this here than in music with male vocalists at the time) emanating from within the protagonist. Bradby herself notes that listeners go to great lengths to hear the songs in this way – that is, to hear dialogue as different voices of a single person (p. 364, and see note 23). The example offered by Bradby that I agree does indeed force a reading as emanating from ‘multiple personae’ is the Shirelles' ‘Foolish Little Girl’, since it seems openly a dialogue between two speakers. This I still hear in relatively simple terms, though: the song has two ‘protagonists’ interacting.Google Scholar\n\n55 This trope of reception began right away. For example, Melody Maker had a column called ‘Blind Date’, in which each week a guest performer reviewed newly released singles without being told who had recorded the songs. Dave Berry was the guest reviewer for the week; he guessed the single was the Kingsmen (the Kinks were not yet known – this would become their first hit) and claimed: ‘It's fabulous this one. I like these records that sound as if they've gone into a recording studio and done what they wanted on the spot’ (Melody Maker, 8 August 1964, 11). So the reinforcement of the ‘spontaneous’ reception pattern was off to a good start.Google Scholar\n\n57 In the former, the protagonist gazes out of his window over the ‘dirty old river’ Thames and watches lovers meet on a bridge, content in his resignation to stay at home alone and watch the world go by; in the latter, the protagonist thanks an ex-lover for all the good times, but in a twist during the song's bridge section confesses that now ‘the night is long, it just brings sorrow’. Nostalgia, the emotional kernel of both songs, is an inherently ambivalent emotion, and one of the most recurrent themes in Davies's writing. These songs capture the bitter-sweet sentiments they express with haunting musical details: for example, in ‘Waterloo Sunset’ the gently ethereal backup vocals and lazy vocal phrases that begin on the beat but end off it intersect with the bass line as it descends in scalar fashion from I to IV6.Google Scholar\n\n59 Davies's comments about an early press interview are interesting here: ‘Keith Altham of the New Musical Express hated the record. I talked to him about duality and people, bisexuality and things like that, and the NME wouldn't print that sort of thing. They wanted us to be really normal, go-ahead … boys, you know, have a pint and piss off. But I wasn't like that’ (quoted in Savage, The Kinks, 60). Certainly Derek Johnson's early review of the song in the NME (30 August 1965, 4) is positive and makes no mention of sexuality. Given the chance, Davies broached the topic himself in print, perhaps frustrated that music-press reviewers were not taking the bait. The most interesting example of this is an interview with Maureen Cleave for her weekly ‘Disc Date’ column in the Evening Standard (28 August 1965, 7). Here Davies directly claimed the song was ‘about homosexuality’, about a man who is given ‘a rotten deal’ by women and turns to his ‘friends’. At the same time Davies tied himself into the equation by making provocative comments about pop music as a place to mix one's own identity with one's audience's. For example he told Cleave he was ‘writing a musical about a character who is a mixture of Hitler, John Charles, the footballer, and himself [i.e. Davies]. “It's really about everybody”, [Davies] said … “The biggest thing that could happen to me is if somebody could sit in a room all by themselves and listen to one of my songs and say: ‘That's part of me.'”’Google Scholar\n\n63 Ratner, Leonard G., Classic Music: Expression, Form, and Style (New York, 1980), 9. Especially in dealing with songs that have words, there can be confusion between ‘topic’ used in this sense and the normal meaning of the word, so I will follow Allanbrook in using the Greek version ‘topos’ (plural ‘topoi'). See Wye J. Allanbrook, Rhythmic Gesture in Mozart (Chicago and London, 1983), 2. However, it will still be necessary to use the adjective ‘topical’, as in ‘topical analysis’, etc. On the subject of topoi as ‘signs’ see V. Kofi Agawu, Playing with Signs: A Semiotic Interpretation of Classic Music (Princeton, 1991), esp. p. 17 and Chapter 2 (pp. 26–50). In rock music, Philip Tagg's ambitious dissections of Abba's song ‘Fernando’ and the theme music to Kojak (‘Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice’, Popular Music, 2 (1982), 37–67) set a precedent for semiotic analysis. Tagg breaks the sounds down into ‘musemes’ – his term for the ‘smallest possible units of musical meaning’ – and then puts these back together to create an overall reading of the song. Tagg's work is impressive in its creative approach and its exhaustive thoroughness. Whenever it is applicable, however, I believe topical analysis offers the great advantage that it naturally groups ‘musemes’ into larger units that work together. This can save a tremendous amount of time – it pre-sorts and prioritizes the parts (a step that even a supposedly ‘scientific’ study such as Tagg's must still do largely intuitively). Obviously, not all signs in the music can be accounted for by topical analysis, but I am not attempting complete semiotic analyses of the Kinks songs I will discuss. Most of the Kinks' work with voice can be examined through topoi; where it cannot I will deal with other signifiers on a case-by-case basis.Google Scholar\n\n65 In Unsung Voices, Abbate is concerned primarily with the discursive distance required for music to become narrative (as opposed to mimetic). One example she gives is the slow epilogue that closes Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Such a disruption she considers a musical parallel to the act of adding ‘he said’ onto the end of a quote (Abbate, Unsung Voices, 60). This is related to her argument that music must create a ‘past tense’ in order truly to narrate – that there must be a disjunction between the time of telling and the time that is told of (see pp. 52–4). But there is no reason why this sort of discursive voice should be limited to a narrative function. Elsewhere, Abbate has isolated similar moments of disjunction as the locus of decentred voices that are not narrative; most notably, see her discussion of the ‘envoicing’ of Salome in ‘Opera; or, the Envoicing of Women’, Musicology and Difference: Gender and Sexuality in Music Scholarship, ed. Ruth A. Solie (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993), 225–58 (pp. 246–52).Google Scholar\n\n68 Davies, X-Ray, 285. There are also numerous press interviews in which Davies is asked to, or chooses to, look back on his general ambivalence and his relation to the personae he has created in his corpus of songs. For interviews that include discussion of or allusion to the theatricality of ‘Sunny Afternoon’ specifically, see for example John Hutchinson, ‘Kontemplating the Kinks: Nothing's as Bad as Ray Davies Thinks’, Musician, January 1987, 72–80 (esp. pp. 76ff.), and Charles Shaar Murray, ‘Tales of Drunkenness and Cruelty’, Q, September 1989, 70–4 (esp. p. 73; here the connection to ‘Sunny Afternoon’ is quite abstract, but inasmuch as the article's title is a quote from the song, it seems to hover ubiquitously). For an example of Davies projecting outward from the class issue to consider his general ambivalence as a songwriter, see Mendelssohn, The Kinks Kronikles, 166–7.Google Scholar\n\n82 Of the Beatles' output from this period, ‘She's Leaving Home’ could be read this way, but there I would argue that the rest of the song represents only another facet of the same protagonists who appear in the high-pitched first-person lines of the chorus. In ‘I am the Walrus’ the protagonist is indeed abstract, yet the song has traditionally been received as a drug-induced musing from within the mind of a single protagonist – there is no manipulated distance. To my mind, the closest the Beatles came to the kind of manipulation present in Village Green Preservation Society is ‘A Day in the Life’; but even here the two parts of the song, sung by Lennon and McCartney respectively, fit together to create what might be seen as different aspects of the same protagonist persona, the reflective and the active side.Google Scholar\n\n89 These words are from Johnny Rogan's discussion of this album, one of the few to mention any musical elements at all in connection with interpreting the lyrics. His observations about the first track, ‘Village Green Preservation Society’, are as follows: ‘The [song] is a rather quaint listing of the various institutions that need to be preserved. Davies is cast in the role of the saviour of our threatened British culture, though the inclusion of Donald Duck alongside village greens and cricket suggests that the ideal has already been bastardized. The cloying sentiment and smug attitude are fully conveyed through the inane singalong chorus’ (Rogan, The Kinks, 96). Allan Moore also singles out this album to discuss the evocative qualities of the Kinks' stylistic pastiche (Rock, 101–2).Google Scholar\n\n95 It is amusing to consider Dave Davies's comments on the song in his own autobiography, for example. The younger Davies expressed his opinion that he was for the idea of preserving little shops and china cups, but thought his brother had gone a bit too far by adding virginity to the line (Kink: An Autobiography, New York, 1996, 106–7). Such a comment would never have been an issue in a song such as ‘You Really Got Me’. Ray Davies himself explained that ‘This started out to be a solo album for me but somebody just mentioned to me that the Kinks do try to preserve things – we are all for that looking back thing … All the things in the song are things I'd like to see preserved’ (Melody Maker, 30 November 1968, 8). It is also interesting to note that Peter Quaife left the group soon thereafter, apparently largely because Ray Davies was too dominant a voice in the group (see Savage, The Kinks, 104–5).Google Scholar\n\n98 To the Kinks and others in the 1964 wave, the blues genre was losing its cachet as ‘sincere’ and ‘unmediated’ as it became more and more commercial and exploited. (In 1965, Davies himself had claimed that while he loved ‘Smokestack Lightnin“, Howlin’ Wolf's new single ‘Killing Floor’ was ‘authentic rubbish and bluff’; Melody Maker, 24 April 1965, 7.) The Rolling Stones would soon bring back with some force the blues as a basis for their music, of course. But even their most recently released album at the time when Village Green was in preparation, Their Satanic Majesties Request, had been more interested in Sergeant Pepper-like effects and less inclined toward their traditional reliance on the blues.Google Scholar\n\n101 Davies's forays into other media carry on the play of voices seen in the late sixties albums. This is true not only of the autobiography but of the 1983 film Return to Waterloo. Here the medium allows the voices to come visually out of the mouths of various characters, characters who may or may not be figments of the film's protagonist's imagination, in a series of half-real events. A scene in which the voice of a television agony aunt begins to emerge from a train-station public address system is particularly notable. (The reciprocal influence of Pink Floyd's The Wall, the theatricality of which must have been influenced by Davies's work, is also palpable here.)Google Scholar"
