        "text": "Who wrote 'Nothing Compares 2 U'?\n\nThe Family - Nothing Compares 2 U\n\nPop legend Prince wrote the song. In 1985, funk band The Family was created as an outlet to release Prince's music, and a version of the song appeared on their only album, also called The Family.\n\nPrince later released a live duet version with Rosie Gaines in 1993, but his original 1984 recording was not released until 2018, when it was issued as a single by Warner Bros.\n\nPrince - Nothing Compares 2 U (Official Music Video)\n\nWhy did Sinead O'Connor cover the song?\n\nIt was Sinéad O'Connor's manager, Fachtna O'Kelly, who came up with the idea for Irish star O'Connor to cover the song.\n\nSinead O'Connor makes stunning TV comeback with 'Nothing Compares 2 U' performance\n\nChris Hill, co-director of O'Connor's label Ensign, told Mojo in 2009: \"Fachtna O'Kelly, Sinéad's manager, brought in a cassette and when I heard it I actually started crying.\n\n\"I just sat there with tears in my eyes. Then O'Kelly rang up Sinead O'Connor and went, 'Chris is crying.' 'Was it that bad?' Sinéad asked.\"\n\nWhat is the song about?\n\nLike many Prince songs, the star never fully clarified if there was any particular inspiration behind the song.\n\nO'Connor later said of the song: “I think I’m probably similar to millions of people who loved the song, and we’re all people who associated the song with a loss of some kind.”\n\nWhile many assume that the song is about a lost lover, others have said that it was actually inspired by Prince's housekeeper, Sandy Scipioni, who left him to be with her family after her father died.\n\nPrince's recording engineer Susan Rogers, later said: \"Sandy was the person who made sure he had his favourite beverage, which was Five Alive, and she made sure the house was clean and that there were fresh flowers on the piano and that the socks and underwear were washed. That might have been the inspiration.\"\n\nWho directed the music video?\n\nSinéad O'Connor - Nothing Compares 2U [Official Music Video]\n\nIts famous music video was directed by John Maybury, who also directed the video for 'West End Girls' by Pet Shop Boys, and also directed the movies The Jacket and The Edge of Love.\n\nThe video features mostly a closeup of Sinéad O'Connor's face as she sings through feelings of sadness and anger while singing the lyrics.\n\nThe other segments see her walking through the Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris. By the end of the video, two tears are seen rolling down her face, one on each cheek.\n\nO'Connor later said that the tears were real. She didn't expect to cry, but then thought, \"I should let this happen.\"\n\nShe explained that the tears came after thinking about her mother, who died in a car accident in 1985.\n\nHow did it perform in the charts?\n\nThe song was a worldwide hit, topping charts in Ireland, Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was also a top five single in France.\n\nIn the US, it spent four weeks at number one, and was the third best-selling single of 1990.\n\nIt was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1990.\n\nDid Prince ever meet Sinead O'Connor?\n\nYes, but it didn't go well according to Sinead.\n\nSpeaking about her relationship with Prince with Norwegian station NRK in November 2014, O'Connor claimed: “I did meet [Prince] a couple of times. We didn't get on at all. In fact, we had a punch-up.\n\n\"He summoned me to his house after 'Nothing Compares 2 U'. I made it without him. I'd never met him. He summoned me to his house—and it's foolish to do this to an Irish woman—he said he didn't like me saying bad words in interviews.\n\n|So I told him to f**k off. He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at five in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine.\""
