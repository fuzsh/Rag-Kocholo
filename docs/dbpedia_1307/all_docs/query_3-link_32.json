        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nSo I'm just chilling out this rainy Saturday morning (it's morning here in Central Oregon) doing small odd projects around the house and sipping coffee, and I'm loading up on a bunch of Kinks music. I thought about posting in the \"What are You Listening to\" thread, but now I'm inspired to blog out a somewhat detailed overview of Kinks. I hope there are other fans here who will add their too sense.\n\nFirst, I am in no way an authority on their history. I have read a few items, liner notes on comps and reissues, and have a basic idea. I know they started out as a gritty garage pre-punk British Invasion group and evolved into a more sophisticated album oriented group in the late 60s which caused their popularity to wane a bit (hmm, sound familiar on that latter part?). I also remember reading about them being banned from performing in the US at the time, but I don't know all the details.\n\nThe early 70s saw a bit of a resurgence due to the hit Lola and the popularity of AOR. The remaining 70s seemed to be a bit of a rollercoaster for them until another resurgence at the turn of the decade with a string of rock hits utilizing a few recycled riffs. They continued into the 80s with more good hits with a little help from MTV videos.\n\nI'm not proposing a track by track analysis, but I would like to share some thoughts on a few of the hits and almost-hits. Many of these tunes make up the track listing for the excellent comp Ultimate Kinks which is primarily what I am listening to, but with a few missing tracks shuffled in.\n\nYou Really Got Me and All Day and All of the Night--I know that this one-two punch is what put them on the map, but I have heard these two songs so often, I'm almost tired of hearing them...almost. Lots of power, but no depth. Perfect hit material.\n\nTired of Waiting for You, Who'll be the Next in Line, Set Me Free, I Need You, Till the End of the Day, and Where Have All the Good Times Gone--A great string of A and B side singles that display an evolution in sound for the group. Very catchy stuff all the way through.\n\nThe World Keeps Going Round--This one deserves special recognition for a few reasons. It appeared on the Kontroversy album, but not on any single. Imo, it should have at least been a B side. I first heard the song covered by the Smithereens, and upon seeking out the original, I was slightly blown away. Ray Davies demonstrates a somber side to his vocals that really drives home the almost sad atmosphere of the song. Why isn't this on more comps?\n\nI'm Not Like Everybody Else--This may be my all time favorite Kinks song. It's the B side to Sunny Afternoon (I actually have that 45 in my vinyl collection) and major hit-material in my book. This is garage-punk before there was that late-70s \"Punk Rock\". It's a wicked song!\n\nFACE TO FACE--This is obviously a transitional album for the Kinks, as it features more production values and some heavier subject matter. Yet it still comes off a bit as a collection of separate songs. Party Line, brother Dave's lead-off composition is a bit of a social jab, set to a somewhat Beatle-esque tune. Rosy Won't You Please Come Home is a sad bluesy song with a heartbreaking vocal by Ray about his late sister. The rest of the album jumps around through different subjects keeping in tune with slice-of-life and social scenarios.\n\nSOMETHING ELSE--This is among my favorite albums of all time. The cohesiveness of songs is in full force here and it's difficult to split them up in their own right. Waterloo Sunset is one that might stand out among the rest, due in part to it being a mild hit, but generally these are all great songs. Dave Davies is becoming a major contributor at this point with quirky and dark songs like Death of a Clown, Funny Face, and Love Me Till the Sun Shines.\n\nI'm going to stop here for now. My knowledge of the next few albums is limited, although I will come back later and continue at least with the prominent songs. If someone else would like to take the lead on the albums, please do.\n\nTo be continued...………...\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nTo pick up where I left off in my OP, I must mention a few of the non-album singles that were floating around in 1966-67. Apparently, some of these were recorded for an album or two that were never realized.\n\nDead End Street is an amazing dreary song about life on the skids. There's an alternative version that's worth hearing on the FACE TO FACE Deluxe CD set. The demo quality of the track makes it sound even darker than the original version, along with a distorted organ part throughout. But the song in any form is a pretty powerful statement set to a sort of show tune arrangement. I found this video that is both amusing and disturbing:\n\nMr. Pleasant, Autumn Almanac, and Dave Davies' Susannah's Still Alive are all good lively singles from the SOMETHING ELSE period.\n\nThis brings me back to the earlier mentioned Days from the VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY album. What a great song. Perhaps in time I'll have just as much appreciation for the entire album.\n\nMoving on, we've got Starstruck, Victoria, and Shangri La to finish out the 60s. These are all great songs with elaborate production, particularly the latter. Shangri La is a favorite of mine that starts mellow and builds up to a grandiose ending. And it makes a statement or two along the way.\n\nApparently LOLA VS. POWERMAN AND THE MONEYGOROUND is a well loved album, but all I can say is that I'm working on getting into it. The singles LOLA and APEMAN seem to be cut from the same mold stylistically (although I wish they would have boosted the vocal track when they mixed APEMAN).\n\nWell, here's another good stopping point, as I don't have much to say about their string of albums for RCA in the early to mid 1970s. I'll pick this up at a later time...."
