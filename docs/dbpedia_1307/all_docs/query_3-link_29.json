This iconic album perfectly mixes blues rock, rockabilly, and the classic Merseybeat of the 1960s that mixes R&B, skiffle, rock, and the like.\n\nIf you’re looking for that British Invasion sound, Kinks is a perfect beginning. The album was recorded in October 1964. The bands cover of ‘Long Tall Sally’ soared the charts and has the distinction of being The Kinks’s first ever single.\n\nThe band’s second success from the album is the massively popular and best-selling summertime single, ‘You Really Got Me’. It’s crunchy distorted guitar riffs, chimey solo, pounding uptempo beat and soaring harmonies, defined an entire genre.\n\nThis album is the first chapter of one of the most iconic bands in the world and a must have for any fans collection."
