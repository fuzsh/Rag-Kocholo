We get a digital beep, and then a drum machine starts, then it stops and we get the digital beeps again, and this happens a couple of times, and it gives the idea that the tempo is being adjusted, or we're switching between patterns, or something like that.\n\nDuring the sessions for \"Good Day,\" a drum machine was used instead of drummer Mick Avory, due to the conflicts between Avory and Dave Davies. Ray Davies said of this:\n\n\"Dave and Mick just couldn't get along. There were terrible fights, and I got to the point where I couldn't cope with it any more. Push came to shove, and to avoid an argument I couldn't face....we were doing a track called \"Good Day\" and I couldn't face having Mick and Dave in the studio, so I did it with a drum machine.\"\n\nGood Day was released as a single in Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, and didn't have any success in any of those countries.\n\nGood Day was actually the first single released from the album, released in August 1984, and the album followed in November ... The album was the first since Low Budget to fail to reach the US top twenty ...\n\nIt's merely speculation, but I get the impression that although this is a good Kinks song, I doubt that the drum machine, particularly so obviously being a drum machine, did the band any favours in the charts..... For example, although by this stage I become completely accepting of synths, it took a long time for me to be accepting of drum machines in rock music... I kind of expected them in pop, and particularly synth pop, but in rock music there didn't seem to be any excuse for a drum machine.\n\nI believe that the Diana referred to in the song is Diana Dors\n\nWho had sadly passed away on May 4th 1984.\n\nDiana had been a quite popular movie and tv star, also doing stage performance and a lot of other stuff. She also released a solo album, and was on several movie musical soundtracks. She released singles between 1953 and 1981....\n\nMany on here may remember her as the fairy godmother in Adam Ant's Prince Charming video...\n\nI honestly don't know that much about her, so I'll leave it to those more familiar with her to fill in the blanks. I know of her, and I know have seen her in movies and tv shows, but that's about the sum total of my knowledge.\n\nRay opens us up with the idea that although the sky is blue and it is a nice day, he has things going on in his head that are weighing on him.\n\nThen we have him in bed reading the morning paper while eating his breakfast?\n\nbut perhaps it isn't breakfast ... brunch? tea and biscuits.....News Of The World could be a tv show too.\n\nIt's here that he learns that Diana has passed away... this recalls him remembering her, and he says she wasn't necessarily a great actress, but she sure did put on a show, and more importantly for our context here \"She always smiled even when she felt low\".... He used to fancy her when he was a young lad, and it looks like she was an attractive young lady, so that's hardly surprising.\n\nWhen we hit the chorus, the first thing that strikes me is it has \"got to\" be a good day.\n\nIt almost seems like he is hoping for, rather than expecting it to be a good day... and iut gives the impression that he actually needs it to be a good day.\n\nWe move on to the idea that his socks have holes, and he can't find his shoes, but this reminds him that he has holes in his life that need mending, and they are more significant than the holes in his socks.\n\nWe end this verse with the line \"And someone just said that the world's gonna end\"....\n\nIt was the eighties, so someone almost certainly said the world's gonna end... it was the MO during the early eighties at least... I get the feeling that all through history there has been an underlying theme of \"the world is going to end\", and certainly at some point it will, and it will be out of our control anyhow, harping on it isn't useful though. We gotta \"live life\"\n\nThis chorus starts off with Today Better be a good day.\n\nIf we blow away the past with a bloody great blast,\n\nMake it fast, make it fast.\n\nSo have a good day today because it could be your last,\n\nMake it last, make it last.\n\nThis could be read several ways... from at least the village green days Ray has been lamenting the destruction of English traditions and the general race towards the future that the world has been caught up in, and so we could easily read this as being, look if you are going to destroy the past, get it over with, and stop tormenting me that there's hope...\n\nBut we get a little hint that it is more than that.\n\nBlow away the past with a bloody great blast ...\n\nwe get a closer reminder in the next lines\n\nWill it light up the sky?\n\nWill it blot out the sun?\n\nWell we've waited this long,\n\nIt seems to me Ray is talking about the ever present threat of a nuclear blast blotting out the whole human race... and we have talked about this before, because this threat loomed large over the whole of the eighties, and as I've said many times in my adult life, that was why the eighties were so colourful, and the music of pop singers was generally light and fun, it was almost creating a world to escape to, with the constant threat of obliteration in the air.\n\nIn November of 1983 the heart warming, fun and full of joy movie \"The Day After\" first aired, and I probably don't need to tell anyone from the era what that was about, but for any younger folks, the premise was about a nuclear war between NATO forces and the Warsaw pact ... The Day after is pretty self explanatory... post apocalyptic world gear.... it was a ton of fun... and I can't help but wonder if it was on Ray's mind when he wrote this one.\n\nThe Day After was the seventh highest non-sporting televised show up to that point in time, and it was the highest rating television movie in history..... a record it held until 2009 .... yea this movie had an impact.... and yes I saw it lol....\n\nSo we start to see why it better be a good day.... because it may be our last.\n\nYeah, it's gonna be a good day.\n\nHey baby, if you come back home it'll be a good day today.\n\nThey could drop a small atom bomb on the city today,\n\nBut if you walk through that door honey, you know it'll be a good day.\n\nWe have the protagonist longing for the return of a partner, and we are left with no doubt what Ray has been singing about here.\n\nHe doubles down on this idea\n\nAnd now survival is my only aim.\n\nI call friends and see if any remain.\n\nWho was that girl who used to be my flame?\n\nI'd call her if I could remember her name.\n\nHe is even thinking about long lost crushes he's had, and wishing he could remember them and seemingly see them again. Taking stock of a life in the balance like someone diagnosed with a terminal disease.... and for anyone not there, yea it did kind of feel like that.\n\nI figure I have never been very perturbed by the idea of death because all through my childhood I was being told I could die at any moment.... and then society wonders why as teens we start drinking and drugging lol .... It's a funny old world.\n\nHe brings the lyric back full circle and thinks of Diana again\n\nHey Diana, I've really got to learn to take a tip from you,\n\nPut on my makeup and try to make the world take notice of you.\n\nYeah, it's gonna be good day today.\n\nBut don't forget the key line from earlier, that may well be the key line in the song\n\nShe always smiled even when she felt low\n\nI get the impression that this is the theme of the whole song. No matter what it comes down to, we have no idea how long we have left, so don't sit wallowing in the dumps.... put on a smile and do your utmost to make today the best day ever, in spite of all the doom and gloom.\n\nIn spite of our shortcomings and the little tragedies that a/effect every one of us.... Accentuate the positive... Make today the best day it is possible for it to be, no matter what.\n\nYea, I know, easier said than done, and we all have those moments... times... days... when it weighs us down... and as unpopular as it is to say, I think at least, I'm never sure anymore, try and input some positive things when we're on that downward leaning... Avoid politics, super negative music, super negative movies and tv shows etc .. I don't believe they generally cause us to drop into depressive states, but they can help to keep us there... from my experiences at least... anyway, I'll shut up now\n\nMusically ... once we take the drum machine out of the equation, I really like this song musically...\n\nOk firstly, the drum machine... It is actually pretty well programmed, as in it has a couple of change ups, and they work well... My problem is the robotic feel that drum machines create. Very suitable for some songs, but in many ways songs like this that are very human, often feel cheapened by drum machines...... but again...\n\nThis song kind of plays into some Ray themes that are quite popular... and there is a hint of that repetitive lifestyle we have seen. So from that perspective, perhaps the robotic rhythm works as a counterpoint to the organic effort to treat every day as a good day and strive to inject yourself into life in a manner that works against the robotic nature of the world and its systems... in this instance rebelling against the system of fearmongering.\n\nWe get this organ flowing in the background and what sounds like a palm muted rhythm guitar, but it could be a keyboard I guess... later in the song it sounds keyboardy, but it's hard for me to tell at the moment.\n\nRay is delivering my favourite kind of Ray vocal. He has his regular inflection oriented style, but it is straight, human Ray.... with that slight melancholy, with a hopeful edge.\n\nWe have augmentation with harmonica (how long is it since we had harmonica? it seems like a while)\n\nWe get some nice electric accents in there and all in all it flows really well.\n\nThe bridge is excellent and it has a sort of propulsive, uplifting kind of feel to it, and also the chorus prior has a slight chordal modification that works really well too.\n\nWe build up to an excellent ending and I really like the way the keys add that sort of carillion bells kind of sound come in, and I think it is excellent.... accentuating the idea of celebrating each day... even if it is a fake it til you make it scenario. Underneath for the close out we get the real bells come in... does this signify success? The fake it til we make it idea worked, and we have a real celebratory joy kicking in?\n\nAnyway... I really like this song, I think there is a lot more to it than I had previously considered, and a lot of that would be my contention with the drum machine, which on closer inspection could have been a reasonable choice contextually, even though I would have preferred Mick to be on here ... if Mick and Dave could have sorted their crap out ... oh well.... such is life"
