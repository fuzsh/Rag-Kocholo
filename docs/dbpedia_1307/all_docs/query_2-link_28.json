        "text": "Rock is over 20 years old now, and more and more thoughtful rock composers are turning inward to the themes of what the music means, what rock careers are all about and what they themselves can hope to say in a musical culture ultimately geared to an adolescent audience.\n\nNow Ray Davies of the Kinks has turned his attention to those questions explicitly in his latest rock‐theatrical concept album, “Soap Opera,” which he and the band brought in its stage version to the Beacon Theater for a three‐night run that ended Friday.\n\nThe concert began with some older Knicks favorites, highlighted as ever by Mr. Davies's own music‐hall zaniness. He doesn't have much voice left, yet he is still a consummate vaudevillian.\n\nBut in “Soap Opera” he turns around and asks us and himself what it all means. The inquiry comes in the form of a “soap opera” in which a rock star decides to live the life of an ordinary clod for a few days; in the end, it turns out that maybe he has been the clod all along, with escapist dreams."
