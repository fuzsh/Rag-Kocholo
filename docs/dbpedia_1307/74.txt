Back in 1981 I bought the album that this song is the title track to. I had their greatest hits of mostly their sixties hits and this album was the first new Kinks album I ever bought.

The song is a pure rock song with a huge punk edge. I read where a critic wrote that The Kinks were a great punk band who could actually play their instruments and with this song you see that.

This song is my favorite song off the album. While writing Low Budget, their previous album, Ray was watching American TV including “That’s Incredible” where people did dangerous and insane stunts. He writes a fair statement about the viewing public…now and then. Parts of it are crude but is true to life. When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane, But still we watch the re-runs again and again, We all sit glued while the killer takes aim…

The song tells the truth…violence sells.

Ray Davies: “What happens is the consumer is being used to entertain, to get high ratings, to sell products to consumers. It was going around in a circle. That’s a real con. And good shows were being dropped from TV. I’ve just written an outline, and I hope we’re going to get some money from RCA to do a videodisc because it’s a media-based album.”

From Songfacts

The title track to The Kinks 1981 album, “Give The People What They Want” was written by their frontman Ray Davies in response to what he saw on American TV when he was writing songs for their previous album, Low Budget. He noticed that TV was getting more and more sensational, and that viewers were fascinated with violence and tragedy – similar to how Romans watched Christians get fed to the lions.

One show Davies watched was That’s Incredible, where regular people performed dangerous stunts.

Ray Davies said that he took out the following verse:

The French Revolution was a crazy scene

All those aristocrats getting guillotined

The promoters cleaned up

The expenses were low

An execution costs nothing

It’s a wonderful show

Taken at face value with just the title for reference, this song can appear to be about The Kinks making an effort to please their audience by delivering a hit. That interpretation is way off, however, as the song is much more a social commentary on those who pander to the masses.

The Kinks went for a monster drum sound on this one in an effort to make it arena-friendly. To get his sound, they placed corrugated iron around the walls of Konk Studios in London, where they recorded the album.

Give The People What They Want

Hey, hey, hey

Give the people what they want

Well, it’s been said before, the world is a stage

A different performance with every age

Open the history book to any old page

Bring on the lions and open the cage

Give the people what they want

You gotta give the people what they want

The more they get, the more they need

And every time they get harder and harder to please

The Roman promoters really did things right

They needed a show that would clearly excite

The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight

Threw the Christians to the lions, it sold out every night

Give the people what they want

You gotta give the people what they want

The more they get, the more they need

And every time they get harder and harder to please

Give ’em lots of sex, perversion and rape

Give ’em lots of violence, and plenty to hate

Give the people what they want

Give the people what they want

When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane

But still we watch the re-runs again and again

We all sit glued while the killer takes aim

“Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president’s brain!”
