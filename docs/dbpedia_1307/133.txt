The Kinks Biography

The Kinks were an English rock band founded in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies in Muswell Hill, north London. They are regarded as one of the 1960s’ most influential rock bands. The band rose to prominence during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and they were briefly a part of the British Invasion of the United States before being banned from touring in 1965. Their third single, “You Really Got Me,” written by Ray Davies, became an international hit, topping the charts in the UK and reaching the Top 10 in the US.

The Kinks’ music was influenced by a wide range of genres, beginning with American R&amp;B and rock and roll and progressing to British music hall, folk, and country. Ray Davies’ wittily observational writing style fueled the band’s reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, which was evident in albums such as Face to Face (1966), Something Else (1967), The Village Green Preservation Society (1968), Arthur (1969), Lola Versus Powerman (1970), and Muswell Hillbillies (1971), as well as accompanying singles such as the transatlantic hit “Lola” (1970). Following a hiatus in the mid-1970s, the band resurfaced in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the albums Sleepwalker (1977), Misfits (1978), Low Budget (1979), Give the People What They Want (1981), and State of Confusion (1983), the latter of which produced one of the band’s most successful US singles, “Come Dancing.” Furthermore, Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders, and the Romantics covered their songs, boosting the Kinks’ record sales. Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence in the 1990s.

Ray Davies (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, keyboards) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) stayed with the band for the entire 33-year run. In 1984, Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, replaced longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion). In 1969, original bass guitarist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton. Following Dalton’s departure in 1976, Andy Pyle briefly served as the band’s bassist before being replaced in 1978 by Argent bassist Jim Rodford. In the mid-to-late 1960s, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings. When keyboardist John Gosling joined the band in 1970, it became an official five-piece. Gosling left in 1978, and was replaced temporarily by ex-Pretty Things member Gordon Edwards, and then permanently by Ian Gibbons in 1979. The band’s final public performance was in 1996, and it disbanded in 1997 due to creative differences between the Davies brothers.

The Kinks have five Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100. They charted nine albums in the Top 40. They have seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums in the United Kingdom. The RIAA has certified four Kinks albums as gold, and the band has sold 50 million records worldwide. They received the Ivor Novello Award for “Outstanding Service to British Music,” among other honors. The Kinks’ original four members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. Ray and Dave Davies announced in 2018 that they were working to reform the Kinks, with longtime drummer Mick Avory also on board, after years of ruling out a reunion due to the brothers’ animosity and the difficult relationship between Avory and Dave. However, comments made by each of the Davies brothers in 2020 and 2021 would indicate that little (if any) progress has been made towards an actual Kinks reunion for a new studio band album in the years since the initial announcement.
