        "text": "Photo Credit To Wikipedia Commons/ King Charles taking his coronation oath at Holy Trinity Column outside Matthias Church, 30 December 1916\n\nBlessed Charles I of Austria was born on this day in 1887.\n\nHis mother was Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony, the wife of Archduke Otto Franz of Austria (the younger brother of the famous Archduke Franz Ferdinand). After his uncle Franz Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo in 1914, the younger Blessed Charles I of Austria became the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (his father had died back in 1906).\n\nBlessed Charles I of Austria was born in the castle Persenbeug in Lower Austria. That castle is located right next to the Danube River, some 10 km upstream from the famous Melk Abbey. It is interesting that Charles had no part in running state affairs during the reign of his granduncle, Emperor Francis Joseph, but only after the murder of Franz Ferdinand, the previous heir to the throne."
