        "text": "Old Vienna dusted off its imperial finery today to lay to rest Austria's last Empress, paying a regal tribute to a woman who remained quietly true to her lost crown and to the late Emperor through seven decades of exile.\n\nFor the first time since the 600-year Austro-Hungarian monarchy was dissolved in 1919, the ornate black imperial catafalque - borrowed from the Museum at Schonbrunn Palace -rolled past the old palaces and baroque temples of central Vienna to the imperial burial vault. There, under the Capuchin Church, Zita, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, was laid to rest among the richly decorated caskets of the Hapsburgs.\n\nThe Empress Zita, as she remained known through her long exile, died March 14 at the age of 96 in the Swiss nunnery where she lived her last years. Married in 1911, crowned in 1916, exiled in 1918 and widowed in 1922 with eight children, she lived modestly in seven different lands, including Canada and the United States during and after World War II.\n\nIt was only in 1982, after her 90th birthday, that Zita was allowed to visit Austria, and tens of thousands of Austrians turned out to welcome the quiet woman who never renounced her crown and wore only black from the day her husband died. 'This Is History'\n\nAccording to estimates, 40,000 people turned out today despite a thundershower that interrupted a sunny day as the first strains of Mozart's Requiem echoed through the Gothic arches of St. Stephen's Cathedral. The service was timed to the moment 67 years ago, on April 1, 1922, when Zita's husband, the Emperor Charles, died in Madeira. His body is still there, awaiting transfer to his wife's side in Vienna.\n\nMillions more watched the four-and-a-half-hour funeral live on Austrian State television, mesmerized by a spectacle that raised feelings ranging from nostalgia, national pride, fascination and a touch of guilt to plain curiosity.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
