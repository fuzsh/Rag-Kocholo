Charles IV is wearing the densely embroidered Hungarian coronation mantle, which dates to the eleventh century AD. This was the last time the mantle was worn for this purpose. Empress Zita is shown wearing a very elaborate coronation gown and robe that appear to have been decorated with metal thread embroidery.\n\nCharles I/Charles IV was beatified by the Catholic Church in 2004, and is since known as the Blessed Charles of Austria.\n\nWikipedia and YouTube.\n\nDigital source of illustration (retrieved 7 June 2016).\n\nGVE"
