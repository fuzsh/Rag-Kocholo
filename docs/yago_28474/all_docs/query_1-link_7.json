        "text": "I’ve written a couple of blogs about Sisi, Empress of Austria. But her successor is as impressive as she was. Who was Zita, the last Empress of Austria. Let me tell her her story.\n\nYouth\n\nPrincess Zita of Bourbon-Parma was born at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. She was the 17th (!) child among Robert’s 24 children (with two marriages).\n\nIn 1907, Zita’s father died and she and her sister Francesca were sent to a convent on the Isle of Wight. Faith was very important in the family. Three of Zita’s sisters became nuns. Zita considered it for a while, but destiny took her somewhere else.\n\nMarriage\n\nEmpress and queen\n\nCharles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the coronation there was a banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations during a time of war.\n\nCharles and Zita had by then zeven children. There would be eight in total. Click on the image below for the full family tree:\n\nEnd of Empire\n\nBy 1918, the war was closing in on the embattled Emperor. On 16 October, the emperor issued a “People’s Manifesto” proposing the empire to be restructured on federal lines with each nationality gaining its own state. Instead, each nation broke away and the empire effectively dissolved. In Vienna, ministers had been appointed by the new state of “German-Austria”, and by 11 November, together with the emperor’s spokesmen, they prepared a manifesto for Charles to sign. The Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed the next day.\n\nLife in Exile\n\nAfter a difficult few months at Eckartsau, the Imperial Family received aid from an unexpected source. Zita’s brother Prince Sixtus had met King George V and appealed to him to help the Habsburgs. George was reportedly moved by the request, it being only months since his imperial relatives in Russia had been executed by revolutionaries, and promised “We will immediately do what is necessary.”\n\nBy March 1919, the Emperor had to leave the country as soon as possible. A train to Switzerland was arranged with some difficulty. The family’s first home in exile was Wartegg Castle in Rorschach, Switzerland, a property owned by the Bourbon-Parmas. However, the Swiss authorities, was worried as the location was so close to the Austrian border. Soon the whole family moved to Villa Prangins, near Lake Geneva.\n\nEventually, it was decided that the family would stay on the Portuguese island of Madeira. First Charles and Zita went alone. The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922.\n\nDeath of Charles\n\nCharles had been in poor health for some time. After a shopping trip, he was struck by an attack of bronchitis. This rapidly worsened into pneumonia, not helped by the inadequate medical care available. Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita (at the time eight months pregnant) helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April 1922.\n\n67 years of Widowhood\n\nAfter Charles’s death, the family was to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had arranged the family to relocate to Spain. Travelling with the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal, they then arrived in Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid. Soon after her arrival, Zita gave birth to Archduchess Elisabeth. The Spanish king offered his exiled relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nContinuously on the move\n\nBy 1929, the elder children were about to go to university and it was decided to move closer to other relatives ner Brussels and the family moved to the Belgian village of Steenokkerzeel. There were some talke with the Austrian government for a Habsburg restoration with Crown Prince Otto. But the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938 stopped all descussions.\n\nWith the Nazi invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Zita and her family became war refugees. The castle was bombed by the Germans, but they survived. They fled to Zita’s brother Prince Xavier’s castle at Bostz in France. The moved on to the Spanish border, then on to Portugal. After a perilous journey overseas, they arrived in New York City in July. They eventually settled in Quebec.\n\nPost-War\n\nIn the years after the war, Zita travelled several times to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided to move back to Luxembour in 1952, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia died at the age of 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur suggested that Zita could stay in a residence that he administered at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. She accepted with ease.\n\nOn YouTube, I found this interview with her, dating from 1972. It’s really great to hear her talk:\n\nIn her final years, Zita was involved in the efforts to have her deceased husband, the “Peace Emperor” canonised. In 1982, she was allowed to return to Austria after being away for over 60 years.\n\nDeath\n\nAfter her 90th birthday, her health began to decline. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia and spent most of the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called her family to say goodbuy and she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old. She was allowed to rest in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nFollowing an ancient custom, the Empress had asked that her heart, which was placed in an urn, stay behind at Muri Abbey, in Switzerland, where the Emperor’s heart had rested for decades. In doing so, Zita assured herself that, in death, she and her husband would remain by each other’s side.\n\nOn 10 December 2009, Mgr Yves Le Saux, Bishop of Le Mans, France, opened the diocesan process for the beatification of Zita. By starting this cause, the late Empress has been accorded the title Servant of God."
