Edited by USA / Canada Delegate Suzanne Pearson, Cathy Pearson, USA / Canada Webmaster Fr. Jordan Hainsey, and Rev. Britton Hennessey, Bold Union utilizes vignettes from the life of the last-ruling imperial family of Austria-Hungary as a witness to the bond of marriage, helping to supplement the preparation a couple receives in their own diocese. Couples are invited to spend half an hour each day, for six weeks leading up to their wedding, growing in prayer and openness to each other. The structure for each day is the same: a vignette from the life or marriage of Karl and Zita, a reflection on the sacramental bond, questions for conversation, and short Catholic prayers.\n\nDesigned by USA / Canada League Webmaster and Designer, Fr. Jordan Hainsey, Bold Union: Preparing for Marriage with Karl and Zita features a luxurious soft-touch cover, with a bright white paper stock for easy reading and vibrant, saturated images.\n\nEight illustrations were commissioned by the League of Prayer U.S.A. and Canada from John Ritter, an American Post Pop artist and illustrator whose vibrant figural and cultural depictions have consistently defined the pages of The New Yorker, Time, GQ, The New York Times, and Harper's. Ritter began his career in northern California in the early-1990’s, where his unique style and deployment of color landed him a slot on the design team that created and marketed Adobe© Photoshop©. Since then, Ritter has seen his uncompromising interpretations of film, writers, musicians, and politicians work their way into the collective American psyche. Utilizing photographs from the Gebetsliga Archive, Bold Union: Preparing for Marriage with Karl and Zita, is Ritter’s first collection of religious-themed illustrations which contextualize sanctity in the 21st century and boldly reinterpret the familiar images of Karl and Zita.\n\nBold Union: Preparing for Marriage with Karl and Zita is the perfect companion for engaged couples beginning their journey together or married couples who wish to deepen their marital bond and explore the vows they made on their wedding day. Printed and bound in the U.S.A., this book carries the Imprimatur of Bishop Roger J. Foys, D.D., of the Diocese of Covington, and an accompanying Nihil Obstat.\n\n40 pages.
