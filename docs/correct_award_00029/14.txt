The Nobel Prize in Literature for 2007 is awarded to the English writer Doris Lessing “that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny”. She has written works ranging from short stories to science fiction and is especially noted for the classic The Golden Notebook. Her most recent novel is The Cleft and it tackles one of her enduring themes “how the specifics of gender affect every aspect of our existence”.

Doris is reportedly unimpressed by the honour: “I can’t say I’m overwhelmed with surprise,” Lessing said. “I’m 88 years old and they can’t give the Nobel to someone who’s dead, so I think they were probably thinking they’d probably better give it to me now before I’ve popped off.”
