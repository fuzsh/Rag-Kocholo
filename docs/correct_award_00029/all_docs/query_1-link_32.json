        "text": "Authors remember Nobel-winning writer Doris Lessing\n\nHere's a look at what's buzzing in the book world today:\n\nRemembering Doris Lessing: USA TODAY's Jocelyn McClurg remembers Nobel-winning author Doris Lessing, whose work was a linchpin for women's studies despite her rejection of the \"feminist\" label. The author of The Golden Notebook, The Grass is Singing and more than 55 novels, works of non-fiction and poetry, died Sunday at 94. At The Guardian, Margaret Atwood recalls reading Lessing on a park bench in Paris in 1963: \"Doris did everything with all her heart, all her soul, and all her might,\" Atwood writes. More: The New Yorker has linked to Lessing's various literary contributions to the magazine, and here are 10 quotes to remember her. Authors tweeted about her death, including Salman Rushdie, who wrote, \"Doris Lessing, gone at 94. Remembering her warmth, her sharp mind, her ferocity. To re-read: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8.\"\n\nRIP Barbara Park: In other sad book news, Barbara Park, the teacher-turned-best-selling children's book author of the Junie B. Jones series, has died at 66 of ovarian cancer. She wrote more than 50 books and reached No. 6 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list.\n\nNew and noteworthy: Take a look at the five hottest books on sale this week, including King and Maxwell by David Baldacci, Anjelica Huston's memoir and Takedown Twenty, a new Stephanie Plum book by Janet Evanovich.\n\nReviewed: Want to know more about revered choreographer-director Bob Fosse? Sam Wasson has written a biography of the figure, Fosse(***Â½ out of four), \"a jazzy, discursive and relentless energy well aligned with its subject.\" And The Heart of Everything That Isby Bob Drury and Tom Clavin (***) tells the \"compelling and fiery narrative\" of Red Cloud, the only American Indian chief to wage war against the U.S. army and defeat it.\n\nDestination libraries: Book lovers, get ready to read about your fantasy vacation. The New York Times profiles hotels with memorable libraries that have become literary destinations of their own. Hotels include Fogo Island Inn in Newfoundland, which \"features furnishings, crafts made by local artisans and a province-focused library.\" The Ballyfin in Ireland's ground floor is \"devoted to a library befitting a Masterpiece Theater production.\"\n\nA literary anniversary: In honor of the 15th anniversary of the Dave Eggers-founded literary magazine McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, the best-selling author is publishing an anthology of the journal's best work. Eggers and Nyuol Tong talk to NPR about McSweeney's growth into a publishing powerhouse.\n\n--"
