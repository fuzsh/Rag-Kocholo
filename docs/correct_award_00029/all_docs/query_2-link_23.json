I’m sure you’d like some uplifting remarks of some kind”, having just returned home from a visit to the supermarket.\n\nWhile we’ve seen a large number of Nobel Prizes in the sciences cross the block in recent years, the literary award remains rare at auction.\n\nAnother, the Literature prize awarded to Roman scholar and numismatist Theodor Mommsen, is selling at Heritage Auctions in January.\n\nThere’s every chance Lessing’s medal could exceed its estimate, given her literary status. Star power is a major factor in the value of Nobel prizes.\n\nThe record is $4.8m, set for the one awarded to DNA scientist James Watson – one of few recipients known to the broader public."
