        "text": "Earlier this week, Doris Lessing was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nThe Swedish Academy chose her because they felt she was the writer who was “that epicist of the female experience, who with skepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny.”\n\nSome of her novels include The Golden Notebook, The Good Terrorist, and her latest novel, The Cleft. You can search our catalog for more of her works.\n\nMore information about this award is available in a New York Times article, an AP Story, and the Nobel Prize website. More information on the author herself can be found on the official Doris Lessing website and in the NoveList database.\n\ndoris lessing, nobel prize, nobel prize for literature, 2007, chelmsford library, chelmsford public library"
