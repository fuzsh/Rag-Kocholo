        "text": "British novelist Doris Lessing, who found out about her Nobel Prize for literature from a reporter waiting outside her home, said it gave her the \"royal flush\" of prizes for writing.\n\n\"I've won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one,\" she said as she stepped out of a taxi carrying groceries. \"I'm delighted to win them all, the whole lot ... It's a royal flush.\"\n\nSitting on the step outside her front door, the telephone ringing constantly behind her, the feisty 87-year-old issued a stern anti-war message and also described how she had once been told by an official that she would never win the Nobel Prize.\n\n\"People who have never even heard of me will now go out and buy my books,\" she told about a dozen reporters and cameramen crammed into her tiny front garden. \"It's a very nice thing. So now I'm going to earn some money.\"\n\nShe only learned about the award when asked for her reaction by a Reuters television crew. She later told the media:\n\n\"I took my son to the hospital and I've been on the Heath so I didn't know [about the prize] until there were photographers,\" she said, referring to London park Hampstead Heath.\n\n\"I thought you were photographing the street for some television serial or something like that.\"\n\nLessing revealed that, once at a formal reception in Sweden, she was approached by an official connected with the Nobel Prize who told her she would never win the award.\n\n\"I hope their manners have changed,\" she said, referring to the Nobel organisers.\n\n\"Can you imagine the scene? [With] my Swedish publisher at a very, very formal dinner ... an official, he said, 'I've come to tell you you will never win the Nobel Prize,' and I hadn't asked for it, you know,\" she said.\n\n\"Can you imagine the cheek? What am I to say? 'Oh dear, I'm so sorry, why don't you like me?' \"\n\nLessing said her next book, Alfred and Emily, was an anti-war book dedicated to her parents, who were damaged by their experiences of World War I.\n\n\"I've written a book about my parents, who were very much damaged by World War I, as if there was no World War I. I've given them lives, ordinary, decent lives without war.\n\n\"In the second half is what actually happened to them in the war and actually it's pretty painful if you contrast the kind of lives they might have had with what actually happened to them.\"\n\nShe said her father was wounded just before the 1917 Battle of Passchendaele, and he suffered for the rest of his life.\n\n\"My father, months before he died, he used to lie in bed reciting the names of his men who died at Passchendaele.\"\n\nLessing had a warning for younger Europeans who had not lived through war and a message for political leaders today who started conflicts.\n\n\"I hope [something] can change the minds of people who govern us, anything that will prevent any war anywhere, because we know what it's like and you people do not know what it's like.\"\n\nShe sent the manuscript of Alfred and Emily to her agent recently, and he described the last 200 pages as \"unbearably painful\".\n\n\"Good. Let them be unbearably painful, so people know a bit what war can really be like,\" she said.\n\nLessing said that \"some very good people\" had refused Nobel Prizes in the past.\n\nWhen asked if she might do the same, she quipped: \"I hadn't thought about it. Do you think I should refuse it? I'll go and think about it very seriously now. OK?\"\n\nReuters"
