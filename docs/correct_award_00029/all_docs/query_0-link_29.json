        "text": "JOHN SPARKS:\n\nMs. Lessing's first novel was published in 1950. Dozens of works of fiction followed, along with plays and non-fiction and autobiography. She was a child of the British Empire, born in Persia and raised on a farm in Rhodesia. There was little formal learning, but her parents loved books.\n\nDORIS LESSING:\n\nWell, they also read and told stories, and my mother ordered books. Now, we're in the middle of Africa, you understand, ordering books from England. So I had the most wonderful list of books as a child.\n\nDORIS LESSING:\n\nWhen I wrote \"The Golden Notebook,\" and I wrote these things that women were saying, apparently it was absolutely astounding to everyone. \"My god, what an extraordinary revelation!\" But I was writing down what women were saying.\n\nWhat surprises me is that everyone reading that book would have heard women saying these things, but they weren't listening to what they were saying.\n\nDORIS LESSING:\n\nThis is what one has to expect from the literary establishment, I'm afraid. Well, they didn't like my so-called science fiction. Why should they? It was absolutely outside what they were used to. But in my view, my personal view, it's some of the best writing I've ever done. And when they get around to noticing it…\n\nDORIS LESSING:\n\nWell, I feel a bit like the icing on the cake. That's what it is. I mean, no one — I mean, it's such a glamorous prize, and so many good people have won it, so you can't say you don't care about it."
