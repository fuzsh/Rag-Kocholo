Museveni has been in power since 1986 and changed Uganda’s constitution to enable him to run for yet another five-year term. Running in the country’s 2021 presidential elections, Bobi Wine uses his music to denounce the dictatorial regime and support his life mission to defend the oppressed and the voiceless people of Uganda. In this fight, he must also take on the country’s police and military, which are not afraid to use violence and torture in a vain attempt to intimidate and silence him and his supporters.\n\nBACK IN THEATERS\n\nOpens Friday, February 16\n\nChicago, IL - AMC River East 21\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nLos Angeles, CA - AMC Burbank 8\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nLos Angeles, CA - Laemmle Monica Film Center\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nMemphis, TN - Malco Studio on the Square\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nMontclair, NJ - Clairidge Cinemas\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nNew York, NY - AMC Empire 25\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nSan Francisco, CA - Presidio Theatre\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nWashington, D.C. - AMC Hoffman Center 22\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nOpens Friday, February 23\n\nNew York, NY - Firehouse: DCTV's Cinema for Documentary Film\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nOpens Friday, March 1\n\nRaleigh-Durham, NC, - Chelsea 3\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nOpens Friday, March 8\n\nOmaha, NE - Dundee Theatre\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nBIOS\n\nMeet the Participants\n\nBOBI WINE\n\nPARTICIPANT\n\nRobert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, famously known as Bobi Wine, is a musician turned politician who is the current leader of the National Unity Platform (NUP) and the People Power Movement. Bobi was born in Mpigi District in Uganda on Feb. 12, 1982. He grew up in the Kamwokya slums in the northeast part of Kampala. His mother was a nurse, and his father was a veterinarian and farmer.\n\nBobi is a singer, musician, actor and activist. He has campaigned for hospital sanitization, malaria prevention, refugees’ rights and children’s education. His songs are known as peaceful protest and edutainment (a mix between education and entertainment), focusing on the struggles of Uganda’s underprivileged and low-income earners and calling upon young people to join politics and change their country’s destiny. He is married to Barbara Itungo Kyagulanyi, known as Barbie, with whom he has four children.\n\nHis characteristic enthusiasm for democratic discourse and the popularity he had earned from his prior artistic and philanthropic endeavors successfully endured his transition to politics. Bobi Wine continues to lead the NUP, the largest political opposition party in Uganda and has become the main opposition leader to President Museveni’s rule.\n\nBARBARA “BARBIE” ITUNGO KYAGULANYI\n\nPARTICIPANT\n\nBarbara “Barbie” Itungo Kyagulanyi is an author, philanthropist and human rights activist.\n\nBarbie’s 2012 book, “Golden Memories of a Village Belle,” gives insight into her early childhood experiences with village politics and local council elections, her African family unit, and the abject poverty that led to the early marriages of her childhood friends.\n\nIn 2013, Barbie founded Caring Hearts Uganda, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that seeks to champion development projects in rural areas, prioritizing health care, maternity, education and sanitary programs. The NGO supports empowering leadership in girls through HIV/AIDS eradication, menstrual hygiene instruction, and continuing education, teaching traditional Ugandan values while encouraging girls to stay in school. In the community, the NGO has extended entrepreneurship skills to teen mothers for personal development and sustainability.\n\nWith a master’s degree in human rights law from the University of London, Barbie has taken on the mantle of demanding equity and equality for women in political spaces through the women’s wing of the National Unity Platform political party, which is led by her husband, Kyagulanyi Ssentamu.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nCHRISTOPHER SHARP\n\nDIRECTOR, PRODUCER\n\nChristopher Sharp was born in Uganda and has a deep appreciation for the country’s people, culture and extraordinary natural beauty. He spent his early working life as a film editor in London and more recently has revisited the profession as director of ‘Bobi Wine: The People’s President’.\n\nHe met Bobi and Barbie in 2017 and was inspired by their courage. Christopher believed in their extraordinary capacity to enact change, and instantly knew that their enormous sacrifice and resilience needed to be documented.\n\nHe worked closely with a number of talented individuals, including Editor Paul Carlin, as well as acclaimed Producer John Battsek, Co-Director Moses Bwayo, and other inspirational cinematographers. Collectively they have made a film which he hopes gives courage to all those who struggle under oppressive regimes.\n\nMOSES BWAYO\n\nDIRECTOR, DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nMoses Bwayo is a Los Angeles-based filmmaker known for shooting and co-directing the award-winning feature documentary “Bobi Wine: The People’s President” (2023). Born in the village of Bududa on the slopes of Mount Elgon in eastern Uganda, Moses was introduced to filmmaking by peeking through cracks in the walls of local kibandas, bootleg movie theatres housed in wooden shacks. Wrapt in the exciting camerawork and storytelling of Hollywood’s martial arts films, Moses immediately fell in love with cinema.\n\nAt 19, he moved to the capital of Uganda, got a job as a portrait photographer, and began studying at Kampala University. In 2013, he graduated with honors with his Bachelor of Arts in journalism and mass communication. Moses went on to earn a postgraduate diploma at Kampala Film School, the nation’s top film and television conservatory, and started working as a production sound recordist and cinematographer.\n\nHis life changed when he met Oscar®-nominated director Mira Nair, who was facilitating a workshop for aspiring filmmakers at her Maisha Film Labs. He was chosen as a boom operator on Nair’s short documentary “A Fork, a Spoon and a Knight” (2014). Subsequently, Nair took Moses under her wing and mentored him for two years, during which he performed sundry jobs for Disney’s “Queen of Katwe” (2016), travelling to the United States for the first time for the final mix with Nair in New York.\n\nIn 2016, Moses started his own production company in Kampala, Jajja Productions, where he oversaw production and post-production services on various commercial, documentary, and feature films. Moses’ reputation as a courageous verité cinematographer and local fixer began to grow, shooting for ABC, BBC, and VICE News for their Uganda-based productions.\n\nIn late 2017 His life changed again when he began work on the feature documentary “Bobi Wine: The People’s President.” Working closely with co-director and producer Christopher, Moses spent five harrowing years following Bobi Wine, a pop star turned politician who ran for president opposing Yoweri Museveni, a dictator who has been in power since 1986. During the production, Moses was arrested, imprisoned, and shot in the face at close range while filming. Two-time Oscar winner John Battsek also produced the film. With mounting threats to him and his family for making the film, Moses fled Uganda to the United States.\n\n“Bobi Wine: The People’s President” premiered to a 10-minute standing ovation at the 2022 Venice Film Festival in September 2022, where it sold to National Geographic before making its U.S. premiere at the 2022 Telluride Film Festival. The film won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2022 Hamptons International Film Festival.\n\nJOHN BATTSEK\n\nPRODUCER\n\nJohn Battsek is one of the most successful producers in feature documentary filmmaking. Starting with Academy Award winning One Day in September, which John conceived of and produced, he has since been responsible for some of the most acclaimed documentaries in recent years.\n\nJohn’s most notable credits include Academy Award & BAFTA-winning Searching For Sugar Man, Academy Award-nominated Restrepo and Winter On Fire, and Emmy-winning Manhunt: The Story Of The Hunt For Bin Laden, The Tillman Story and Forever Pure. John served as producer on Grammy-nominee Eric Clapton: Life In 12 Bars and the BAFTA nominated & Peabody winning Listen to Me Marlon. John also served as Executive Producer on the BAFTA Award winning The Imposter and Hillsborough.\n\nIn 2020, John launched his new production company Ventureland with long-time PrettyBird collaborators Kerstin Emhoff, Ali Brown and Paul Hunter. His most recent credits include Emmy Award winning The Rescue (National Geographic), double Emmy winning Rising Phoenix (Netflix), critically acclaimed biopics Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In, and Lady Boss: The Jackie Collins Story. In 2022 John served as producer on Mary McCartney’s directorial debut, If These Walls Could Sing, the story of London’s iconic Abbey Road recording studio, which premiered at Telluride 2022 and was released on Disney+.\n\nMost recently, John produced the freediving documentary The Deepest Breath which premiered at Sundance 2023 and will be released by Netflix later this year. John also produced Alex Gibney’s portrait of former tennis legend Boris Becker (Apple TV+) and a three-part series on David Beckham directed by Fisher Stevens for Netflix.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY\n\nCREDITS\n\nDirected by Moses Bwayo, Christopher Sharp\n\nProduced by Christopher Sharp, John Battsek\n\nCo-Produced by Megan Hollinghurst\n\nExecutive Producers Humble Lukanga, Sol Guy, Alastair Siddons, Carolyn Bernstein, Kerstin Emhoff\n\nDirectors of Photography Sam Benstead, Moses Bwayo, Michele Sibiloni\n\nEdited by Paul Carlin"
