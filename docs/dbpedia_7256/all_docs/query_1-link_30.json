        "text": "Really struggles deciding if it wants to be a movie about the recording studio or a movie about The Beatles. Any time it veers too far in one direction, it takes a hard turn back to the other. Interesting watch but nothing too special.\n\nAlso, what a rough time to release a documentary with a Kanye West jump scare.\n\nThe highlight was my entire family turning to look at me every single time Noel Gallagher appeared.\n\nMusic, man. It’s pure magic, it’s spiritual, it’s everything, sometimes it’s the only thing we have. The fact that somewhere like Abbey Road exists proves that music is something so much bigger than us all - it is a current through everything and that connects each one of us to the cosmic universe. I had the immense privilege to visit Abbey Road this past summer and even just turning the corner, suddenly the feeling changes - there is magic there.\n\nThis needed to be a several parts mini series. I feel SO short-changed by this... Disney, you can't expect that after the amazing long weekend I had with the Fab Four, I'd be satisfied with a rather short hour and a half. They barely touch the Brit Pop moment from the 90s or the live performance tv show from the early 2000s - Live from Abbey Road.\n\nI've loved Mary McCartney since she was a baby, staring out at 10-year-old me from inside her father's fleece-lined leather jacket on the back of his first solo LP. And she does a fine, if a little safe, job in showing the history of the famed Abbey Road studios in London.\n\nThere's a lot more to these recording studios than The Beatles of course, with its reinvention as a film soundtrack recording studio - starting with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' - of particular interest to movie fans.\n\nThere's lots of interesting stuff in this 90-minute doc, and Mary, perhaps unsurprisingly, gets access to many of the top stars who have recorded music there.\n\nWatched on Disney+."
