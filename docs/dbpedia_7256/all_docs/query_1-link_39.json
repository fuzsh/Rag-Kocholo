        "text": "hilarious look at audiobooks, narrators and fans\n\nErin Mallon is a favorite narrator and she brought a stellar cast of narrators to the table for her debut audiobook. A funny, over the top sexy look at the world of romance audiobooks, the narrators and its listeners.\n\nI laughed, nodded and devoured this in one sitting.\n\nLaugh out loud funny!\n\nThis was the most entertaining thing I've listened to in a while. Erin is so talented. I really cannot wait to see what she comes up with next! The cast of narrators was outstanding and I loved the bloopers and sneak peek of Flirtasaurus!\n\nFantastic writing and very humorous!\n\nThe humor, the characters, and the style of writing is just amazing. So the characters! They are all well written and with completely different personalities. No one is the same but they all fit so well together. You can't help but empathize with their struggles because everyone goes through something. The central characters, Vera and Cameron, really shine here.\n\nThe narrators, of course, did a phenomenal job! The way they deliver a punchline is so on point! I couldn't stop laughing at Joe and his noises. LOL! So well done.\n\nWith all of that said, I highly recommend this audiobook especially when you need something to cheer you up. It has romance, friendship, humor, and most of all, understanding one another.\n\nHilarious, twisted story!\n\nI loved the multiple narrators in this, the hilarious play/storyline, and the laugh out loud (SEVERAL) moments!\n\nI have already recommended this to people and absolutely recommend it to anyone reading this review!\n\nJust grab it and hold on and listen! 5 LMAO stars!!!\n\nBest. Audioplay. EVER!\n\nI love Erin Mallon - her narrating, her novels, and most especially her audioplays. This is by far her best one! It is absolutely freaking hilarious!!\n\nNot only does it have a dream team of narrators (not all of my favourites are included, but every single one of these peeps is on my top faves list!! Love them all so much!), but this play is about poking fun at the entire romance genre, as well as the audio recording and listening scene! Oh, my but it is 2 hours of pure listening pleasure!\n\nYou can get this as an ebook or paperback as well, and that would be nice to have on your shelf, but when you can get this with the most amazing narrators to bring the entire thing to life (and have the best voices in your ears), you really do need to listen to this - as it's intended. You need to go out and buy it on Audible and listen now - especially with the Narwhal (Joe Arden) returning in the second installment, coming soon! YUM!\n\n(plus, they've just done an update and improved/enhanced the extra sound effects, so now I will re-listen. I listened just before the update was announced to be coming soon, as I wanted to hear it before and after)"
