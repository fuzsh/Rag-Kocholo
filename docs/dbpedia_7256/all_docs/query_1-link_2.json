It portrayed life in HMP Stone Park, a fictional women's prison. Unlike later women-in-prison TV series, Bad Girls (ITV, 1999–2006), and Australian series, Prisoner (aka Prisoner: Cell Block H, Grundy Organisation, original run: 1979–1986), and Wentworth (2013–2021), Within These Walls tended to centre its story-lines around the prison staff rather than the inmates.\n\nThe lead character was played by British film actor Googie Withers who played the well-groomed, genteel governor Faye Boswell and episodes revolved around her attempts to liberalise the prison regime while managing her personal life at home.\n\nAnother prominent character was her Chief Officer, Mrs. Armitage (Mona Bruce).\n\nGoogie Withers left after three series; in Series Four her character was replaced as governor by Helen Forrester (Katharine Blake), who in turn left to be replaced in the final Series Five by Susan Marshall (Sarah Lawson).\n\nCreator and screenwriter of the programme, David Butler, appeared in some episodes as prison chaplain, Rev. Henry Prentice.[1]\n\nAs of November 2011, Network have released all five series on DVD in the UK,[2] with the exception of \"Nowhere for the Kids\", an episode from Series Two which appears to be missing from the archives.\n\nThe programme was broadcast around 9:00 p.m. (although exact times varied around the ITV regions), but prisoners were locked in their cells 30 minutes before 9:00pm.\n\nGoogie Withers as Prison Governor - Faye Boswell\n\nKatharine Blake as Prison Governor - Helen Forrester\n\nSarah Lawson as Prison Governor - Sarah Marshall\n\nMona Bruce as Chief Officer Mrs. Armitage\n\nJerome Willis as Prison Deputy Governor Charles Radley\n\nDenys Hawthorne as Dr. Peter Mayes\n\nBeth Harris as Miss Clarke\n\nElaine Wells as Principal Prison Officer Spencer\n\nSonia Graham as Assistant Governor Martha Parrish\n\nMiranda Forbes as Prison Officer Parsons\n\nJanet Lees Price as Assistant Governor Janet Harker\n\nSuccessful alumnae from the series included Helen Worth, later widely known for her role of Gail Platt on Coronation Street. Worth appeared in an episode of season 1 alongside Cheryl Murray. The two would be reunited as flatmates in Coronation Street in 1977, when Murray joined the cast as Suzie Birchall. Shirley Cheriton and Anna Wing both appeared in the season 2 episode \"Skivers\", long before becoming original cast members of EastEnders together.\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseriesTitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air date11\"Cause for Concern\"John ReardonDavid Butler4 January 1974 ( )\n\nGovernor Faye Boswell has been in charge at Stone Park women's prison for one month when a prisoner on remand, Martha Kyle, starts to spread stories in the newspaper about her mistreatment by prison officers. As it turns out, Martha is a political activist who is taking any opportunity she can to gain publicity. Meanwhile, another prisoner, Peggy Abbot, screams whenever she's near prison officers, afraid they might beat her just for being black. Is this simply her misconception of the prison system, or is there more to it?\n\n22\"Lesson Number One\"Peter MoffattDavid Butler11 January 1974 ( )\n\nPeggy Abbot is put to work in the prison's nursery to help her cope with her children when she gets out. Initially, things go well until Peggy starts to show signs of slipping back into her old bad habits. Elsewhere, worry arises over the friendship between Lily, a domineering prison veteran, and Nora, a simple-minded first offender. Meanwhile, Faye has to decide how to spend new funding for improvements within the prison itself.\n\n33\"The Walls Came Tumbling Down\"Paul AnnettDavid Butler18 January 1974 ( )\n\nConstruction has begun in Stone Park on filling in the floors of the upper wings to give the prisoners more space. Trouble first starts over the issue of the crowded temporary conditions. Then, the work starts to slow down; it seems that the laborers, male prisoners from another institution, are in no hurry to leave. Meanwhile, Faye's son, Paul, brings a girl home with him, Sally, whose views on the prison system clash with Faye's. A few days later, when a prisoner brought to Stone Park on remand for drug offenses asks to see the governor, Faye is surprised to discover the prisoner is Sally.\n\n44\"In Her Own Right\"Tony WharmbyAdele Rose25 January 1974 ( )\n\nStone Park's Deputy Governor, Charles Radley, deals with a prisoner who threatens suicide.\n\n55\"Prisoner by Marriage\"Paul AnnettTony Hoare1 February 1974 ( )\n\nJane Brogan is transferred to Stone Park so that she can be near her husband and children. However, Jane wants out and intends to use her husband anyway she can to achieve this goal. Meanwhile, a 16-year-old borstal escapee is sent to Stone Park to await trial. Doctor Mayes is incensed by the girl's treatment by the system, which he feels has failed her. He tries to help her, but her distrust of authority figures threatens to hinder his attempts.\n\n66\"The Group\"Jim GoddardTerence Feely8 February 1974 ( )\n\nStone Park's drugs unit is one of Faye's main concerns, believing there must be a better way of treating drug addicts than imprisoning them and doping them up with legal substitutes. Dr. Mayes introduces Faye to a friend of his, Dr. Ormonde, who has tried to deal with drug addiction by using group therapy to a degree of success. Though the prison staff expresses concern because the addicts must be kept off all drugs for the therapy to work, Faye allows Dr. Mayes to set up a group. Things go reasonably well until Magda (Cheryl Hall), a hardcore addict, starts to cause trouble.\n\n77\"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back\"Tony WharmbyTony Parker15 February 1974 ( )\n\nMarilyn Hunter has been in mental hospitals since being convicted of murdering two babies left in her care 12 years earlier. Now, having been given a clean bill of health, she has been transferred to Stone Park. Faye persuades the authorities to allow her to transfer Marilyn without a guard, but her idea of stopping for tea on the way back could cost Faye her job. Meanwhile, prisoner Joan Harrison is due to be moved to a semi-open prison within days. However, Joan doesn't want to leave Stone Park; in particular, she doesn't want to leave Martha Parrish behind.\n\n88\"Failing to Report\"Christopher HodsonRosemary Anne Sisson22 February 1974 ( )\n\nAfter attending a conference as a representative of Stone Park, Charles Radley receives a summons to court over a motoring incident in which he was involved. Charles decides against telling Faye about the incident, but then the papers get hold of the story. Meanwhile, Claire Staines, a usually passive, if distant prisoner, begins to show signs of descent for no good reason.\n\n99\"Tea on St. Pancras Station\"Paul AnnettSusan Pleat1 March 1974 ( )\n\nShirley, a prisoner with mental problems who has previously passed through other institutions run by Faye, is due for release from Stone Park. With professionals dismissing Shirley as a hopeless case, Faye begins to worry about what will become of her once she's on the outside. Faye resolves to help Shirley and make sure that she doesn't end up in prison again.\n\n1010\"Guessing Game\"Bill BainPeter J.
