        "text": "UPDATE: Just a quick note to let all of you stalkers out there know that tonight at 11 p.m. PST I will be interviewed by radio host Peter Anthony Holder for his talk show Holder Tonight on Montreal‚Äôs number one English talk station, CJAD, and on their sister station CFRB, which is the number one talk station in Toronto! üôÇ Those of you who want to listen in to a live stream can do so at www.CJAD.com or www.CFRB.com. The live stream link for both stations is located on the upper left hand side of their homepage. Then tomorrow morning Kelly Green, from Tensessee‚Äôs The Farm 100.9, will be interviewing me at 7:20 a.m., but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt look like that station has streaming audio. üôÅ http://www.thefarmradio.com/greenteam.htm Hopefully they will put the interview in the archive section of their website, though, and I‚Äôll be able to post a link. Now on to the post! üôÇ\n\nA few weeks ago, I dragged Mike, from MovieShotsLA, out to a location I have been meaning to stalk for quite a while now ‚Äì Alicia Silverstone‚Äôs cute little craftsman house from the 1999 movie Blast from the Past. I had actually been wanting to stalk the adorable house ever since I first saw the movie over ten years ago, but had no idea where it was located. So, when I found out that Mike knew the address and had actually stalked the home several times previously, I begged him to take me there. üôÇ\n\nI am very happy to report that the house looks exactly the same in person as it did onscreen in Blast from the Past ‚Äì right down to the little red car parked out front! I‚Äôm not kidding ‚Äì that red car really was parked out there while we were stalking the place!!!! LOL LOL LOL I was shocked to discover, though, that the Blast from the Past house was located in Los Angeles, because, thanks to its Craftsman style architecture, it actually looks more like a Pasadena area home. Even stranger still is the fact that in the beginning of the movie, when Brendan Fraser leaves his family‚Äôs bomb shelter, his mom tells him to seek out ‚Äúa girl from Pasadena‚Äù, because she‚Äôs ‚Äúalways found girls from Pasadena to be a little bit nicer‚Äù. üôÇ So, basically, the Blast from the Past location scouts went, not to Pasadena, but to Los Angeles to find a Pasadena style home to stand in for a Pasadena girl‚Äôs residence. That‚Äôs Hollywood for you! üôÇ\n\nThe house, most notably the front door and front porch area, show up numerous times throughout the movie.\n\nAnd it is on the street in front of the home that Brendan Fraser runs away from the County Family Services people . . .\n\n. . . and crashes his rented meat truck into the County Family Service woman‚Äôs car. LOL LOL LOL\n\n[ad]\n\nI was shocked to discover, while doing research for this post, that the same home was also used in the 1974 movie Chinatown as the house where the mysterious Katherine (Belinda Palmer) hides out. It is amazing to me how similar the home still looks thirty-five years later!! According to IMDB, the same house was also featured in the 2000 made-for-TV movie If These Walls Could Talk 2, but I haven‚Äôt been able to verify that. I can say for certain, though, that it was not the main house used in the movie.\n\nUntil next time, Happy Stalking! üôÇ"
