        "text": "Filmmakers almost never stick to one singular color. Usually, they use groupings of colors in particular ways to create a color palette used throughout their movies. Some use monochromatic color groupings where different hues and saturations of the same color are used to create cohesive color throughout a film or scene. Others may use complementary colors, where colors are paired from opposite ends of the color wheel and be used to create either a sense of balance or a sense of discord within scenes. Still, others may use Analogous (where related colors close to each other on the color wheel are used) or Triadic (all the colors are equal distance away on the color wheel) groups of colors to communicate the overall tone of the film.\n\nI am always looking at beautiful film and movie poster designs for inspiration, and 2023 was a great year for movie posters! ðŸŽ¥ My last YouTube video of the year gives my TOP 10 BEST Movie Posters of 2023.

Yesterday at NAB, Eastman Kodak Company went behind the scenes of Oscar winning-pictures to reveal the secrets of shooting on film. Killers of the Flower Moon DP Rodrigo Prieto used KODAK 35mm color and B&W filmstocks to create looks that honored the heritage of the Osage people for Martin Scorsese's lauded period-thriller. \"I knew Marty wanted to tell a strong, powerful story in a visually realistic way that honored the Osage,\" said Prieto. \"So, I went back to my idea from The Irishman... evoking the memory of a certain era through stills photography of the time. I prefer to take my visual inspirations from real stills and to observe where the camera is in relation to the light.\" Prieto's words and work were inspirational because they resonate with our approach - but also remind us that ideas and clarity of thought are the real keys to successful art and design. If you have a strong vision, respect your subject and understand your audience, you'll be able to generate strong, clear ideas that resonate. The same applies to designing exhibitions and bringing brands in to focus. #nabshow #kodak #killersoftheflowermoon #film #design #vision\n\nThe Story Behind the Logo: American Sons ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The task of capturing the essence of a documentary like \"American Sons\" into a logo was both an honor and a challenge. The poignant story of Cpl. JV Villarreal, his bond with fellow Marines, his video diaries, and the tragic loss at a young ageâ€”these were the raw and genuine tales that the film delved into. Understanding the nature of independent film budgets, it was pivotal to ensure the design was economical yet effective. To achieve this, the color palette was narrowed down to red, white, and blackâ€”a departure from the typical patriotic shades or camouflage patterns. Not only does this choice make it cost-effective and easy to reproduce, but it also adds a distinctive touch while steering clear of common military-associated motifs. Considering that the film's heart lies in the footage, especially JV's intimate video diaries, the logo had to be subtle enough to not overshadow this award-winning content. It had to be easily adaptable, be it on a movie poster or even animated for film intros. The result is a design that resonates with the movie's ethos, is economical for the filmmakers, and provides the perfect visual backdrop to an extraordinary story of brotherhood, sacrifice, and the aftermath of combat. This logo is not just an emblem, but a tribute to JV, his brothers-in-arms, and the communities affected by the lasting impacts of war. Discover the journey of JV and his Marine Brothers in American Sons. https://lnkd.in/g6-mYRyS #StoryBehindTheLogo #AmericanSonsFilm #MOCreative\n\nOne of the GREATEST SCI-FI FILMS of all timeâ€¦ SKETCHED https://lnkd.in/g3Vb8FVx Most people would say that BLADE RUNNER is the Greatest Sci-Fi Film of all time. And as much as the combination of Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford and Syd Mead might be amazing (and it is)â€¦ there is another. THE FIFTH ELEMENT is certainly (along with VALERIAN) one of the most unique Sci-Fi epics ever created. This combination included Director LUC BESSON, BRUCE WILLIS and the talents of Art Greats like JEAN GIRAUD MOEBIUS. But todayâ€™s SKETCH of Korben Dallasâ€™ TAXI from THE FIFTH ELEMENT celebrates unique Sci-Fi and CARS. If youâ€™re a fan of the film, check out the GARAGE and what we have, but also WATCH THE FILM and others inspired by the work of these amazing people. https://lnkd.in/g3Vb8FVx In film, WORLD-BUILDING is key for immersion and INSPIRATION. See what others are doing and let those ideas percolate into your life. DID YOU KNOW?? The Fifth Element was a film of many firsts. Not only did it break financial records at the time, but it also achieved numerous cinematic milestones. One of the major ones involved an action scene that couldâ€™ve gone terribly wrong. Thereâ€™s a moment in the film where an explosion engulfs the Fhloston main hall in flames. While this might seem relatively trivial in a sci-fi action affair, itâ€™s important here because it was the largest indoor explosion ever filmed at the time. No CGI â€“ it was all real. #thefifthelement #fireballtimgarage #scifi"
