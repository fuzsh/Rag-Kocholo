Wollens Paralegal Daisy Otton writes this helpful guide. https://lnkd.in/e28Sq8jt\n\nAs we concluded each of this year's Night Shift Sessions, we were curious to learn about our panellists' preferred main streets worldwide and the reasons behind their choices. Today, we're spotlighting Kelly Harrington, a highly experienced major events professional and speaker at our first Night Shift Session of 2023, whose favourite main streets were in Salamanca, Hobart and Maldon, Victoria. Now, we're eager to hear from youâ€”what's your favourite main street, and what makes it special? Share your thoughts in the comments! #FavouriteMainStreets #MainStreet #MainstreetAustralia #LoveLocal #LoveYourStreet\n\nThe statistics for long terms survival of companies in the UK really isn't very good. 3 out of 5 SME's don't last 5 years. 4.5 out of 5 don't make it to 10. Since 2016 (Brexit) 38% of SME's have failed. Genoa Black is its 11th year and we have grown every one of these years, but we are aware that there is no divine right to survive. We strategise, we refine, we seek feedback and we invest in our team. Most importantly we ensure we deliver to the needs of our clients. Having advised over 800 clients across UK, Europe and North America within the Energy, Renewables, Life Sciences, Bio, Luxury, Engineering Hospitality & F&D sectors we have the context and capability to deliver growth for our clients. But don't take our word for that. 83% of our new business is referrals from past clients."
