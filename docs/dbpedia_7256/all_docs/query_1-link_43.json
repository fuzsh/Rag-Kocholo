        "text": "If these walls could talk, they’d probably scream.\n\nA woman was shocked and revulsed after realizing the “monsters” her daughter had heard were actually a swarm of 50,000 honeybees living in their walls, as detailed in a TikTok video with 9.1 million views.\n\n“What nightmares are made of,” Ashley wrote in the clip’s caption while describing having her house bugged.\n\nThe ensuing footage starts out by showing the perspective of a thermal camera pointed at the wall of her daughter’s bedroom, which depicts a large orange swathe created by the hive’s heat.\n\nThe filter then lifts to show a large hole in the wall and bees flying around the room like something out of the 1992 supernatural horror flick “Candyman.”\n\n“When your daughter has been hearing ‘monsters’ in the walls,” Ashley described in the clip. “Turns out it was 50,000 bees buzzing.”\n\nThe mom’s pop-up apiary created a firestorm of buzz as commenters wondered how she dealt with her stinging squatters.\n\nSaid Ashley in a follow-up video: “Day 1: Beekeeper removed 20,000 bees and 100+ lbs (45kg) of honeycomb from the wall. He found the queen and is able to safely take the hive to a new home.”\n\nOn day 2, meanwhile, the bee expert jettisoned another 20,000 of the interlopers and sealed off the wall to prevent anyone from getting stung, per a subsequent post.\n\nThe mother described in another clip how the bees had built the 100-plus pound honeycomb over eight months, big enough to fill up a trash bag — which, in turn, had to be “triple-bagged” as the initial layer began to break.\n\nWhen followers asked Ashley how she didn’t notice such a sprawling insect metropolis being erected under her roof, she replied: “It only takes a couple bees and a swarm that you might not be able to see to become a colony that’s 50,000 bees.”\n\nUnfortunately, that was only the tip of the insect invasion iceberg: In another clip, Ashley described how they found yet another colony with a queen within the walls, which required yet another extraction.\n\nWhile they finally managed to evict the swarm, the infestation left their house dripping with honey like a giant biscuit.\n\nTo make matters worse, the insurance company said they wouldn’t cover the damages as it “doesn’t have anything to do with the house,” per another video update.\n\nCommenters commiserated with Ashley’s skin-crawling predicament.\n\n“I would honestly rather have monsters in the wall than to have 50k bees,” declared one sympathizer, while another wrote, “I would cry before knowing it was bees.”\n\nOthers regaled fellow commenters with similar tales of these fun-sized honeymakers invading their homes.\n\n“This happened to my friend except while she was out to dinner with her husband the ceiling collapsed above their bed and showered their master bedroom in bees,” described one."
