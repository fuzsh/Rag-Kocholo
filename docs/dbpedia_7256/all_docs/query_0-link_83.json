        "text": "People put a lot of thought into naming their children (and even their pets). Well, this yearbook is your baby, so you want to give it a name that lives up to its content. We’ve put together some tips for how to get the brain juices flowing when it comes to choosing your title, and also some great title ideas we’ve come across over the years.\n\nSet Some Guardrails\n\nThe number of yearbook title ideas rivals the number of fish in the sea, so it helps to narrow your sights before you cast the net. One thing that helps is to pull the yearbooks from the last five years and take note of their titles.\n\nYou should also decide on the tone. Some like yearbook titles to be inspirational, while others like to provide a nod to the overall theme. And for some, being straightforward works best. Regardless, it’s helpful to set the scene in your mind so you can measure your options against your expectations.\n\nDifferent Approaches to Yearbook Titles\n\nThere are a few different routes to take when pursuing a title:\n\nTie it to your School. You can use the school’s name, colors, mascot, or location as a jumping off point.\n\nTime-Specific Title. Make a reference to this current point in time, by calling out the year, referencing a sign of the times like sustainability or social media, or by using a current song lyric or movie quote.\n\nTimeless Titles. These ideas capture the overall intention of a yearbook by speaking to nostalgia, memories, and the passage of time.\n\nWhether you build on your school’s spirit or pay tribute to the collection of memories within, your yearbook’s title should capture the essence of your book and give the reader a sense of the journey to come. Select a few ideas and try them on for size. Share them with your committee and gather some feedback. After you let them marinate, you’ll find that one perfect idea, and it will practically jump onto the cover itself.\n\nYearbook Title Ideas\n\nInterested in a few examples?
