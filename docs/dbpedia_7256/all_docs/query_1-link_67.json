        "text": "Monsters or Zombies\n\nI cannot imagine there are many scenarios that call for giant walls around civilian populations.\n\nSo the question is basically, what kind of threat would change the world enough to make nations build walls around their cities.\n\nIt would have to be an enemy.\n\nAn enemy that can operate freely across large amounts of a nation without serious fear of aerial attack or military confrontation.\n\nLikewise, your hypothetical enemy cannot pass en-mass as normal people. They need to be something that scouts could see coming. An army, or monsters, or aliens or something in that vein.\n\nIf they can pass as civilians and walk in the gates with a little acting, then there's not much point in having the gates/walls to begin with.\n\nYour enemy is indiscriminate and willing to harm civilians, otherwise the fortresses would be purely military and the cities would have much less defense.\n\nIt's also a sustained threat.\n\nThe military can't simply stamp it out once and for all.\n\nIn much the same way as medieval society couldn't stamp out banditry and considered its own neighbors to be sufficiently dangerous that they invested heavily in fortresses and armies.\n\nYour foe is not air-borne. They have no ability to fly over walls and paradrop in.\n\nYour foe lacks the kind of artillery that can bypass a wall.\n\nThose last two pretty much preclude any inter-nation warfare, because any nations able to attack one another like that would possess one or both of those abilities.\n\nYour foe must continue to reproduce itself despite the best efforts to kill it.\n\nIt will take years to build walls like these. The threat needs to be sustained for that entire time without being so apocalyptically dangerous that those cities were wiped out before they could do it.\n\nYour foe must be widespread enough to threaten cities across a huge region. Perhaps not the entire nation, but enough for there to be multiple cities that use this. So it's almost certainly not an environmental threat like dust-storms or suchlike, and in any case that would likely bypass the walls anyway.\n\nYour foe must be a great enough threat to make a physical wall a sensible option.\n\nWe're talking, in short, about monsters, because the conditions that made it make sense with people no longer exist.\n\nMaybe Zombie hordes. Or something else that cannot be allowed to gain a foothold in a city.\n\nPerhaps Kaiju-like giant monsters that are stopped by the physical walls and driven off or killed by the heavy defensive guns and weaponry there.\n\nSomething that takes too much time to kill to deal with before it reaches a major civilian population and inflicts massive casualties.\n\nI can think of one city on particular that remains walled to some considerable degree to this day, and that is Jerusalem.\n\nJerusalem has its main, infamous wall for the primary purpose of formalizing a boundary between the Palestinian and Israeli-controlled parts of the city. You could also reimagine the many checkpoints around Jerusalem as walls, which gives you a very strong reason for putting walls both in and around your modern city; control. It gives the powers that be very accurate information on who is where within a city, and in the event of urban warfare, it makes control over specific sectors of the city much easier. Perhaps it's more common in divided cities like Jerusalem or Berlin after the second world war, or it's an element of an authoritarian government that uses the walls and checkpoints to maintain an eternally vigilant watch on all of its citizens, for whatever reasons that might be.\n\nAs for the material specifications of the Israeli wall in Jerusalem, it is more than just one thing. It is layers of barbed wire fence and tall concrete slabs. At some points it is just a fence, and at others, it is towers of beige concrete topped with barbed wire. I would recommend that, unless the nation in control of this city has access to ridiculous wealth and resources that it is willing to put into this infrastructure project multiple times over for many cities it intends to wall up, that the walls are variable like this. No need to partition the suburbs with 20-foor high towers of imposing concrete; a tall and sturdy fence should do just fine.\n\nStrategically, including walkways on top of the walls gives a very optimal position for soldiers with long-range weapons, and sniper towers could also be added, increasing the strategic benefit.\n\nThe major reasons as I understand that we dont wall all of our cities is that modern cities are absolutely massive, they're constantly expanding and changing layout, and that walls made of strong modern materials are insanely expensive. If you walled in all of L.A. Proper, you'd have a wall that is 342 miles long. It would take about 4 and a half days to walk that if you didn't stop. In this, it just becomes less reasonable to wall a city than it was when they were so much smaller. Now, we have paratroopers and handheld missile launchers and other technologies that just make walls a lot less advantageous than they were in the middle ages.\n\nUltimately, I do not see walls being a widespread phenomenon in any state that is not 1984's Oceania levels of obsessed with the control and whereabouts of its citizens, but also, I as a fellow worldbuilder urge you to just wall the damn cities if you really want to. It sounds cool, and for me, that's usually enough. Hope this helps! ^^\n\nThe purpose of these walls should be city defense.\n\nDefense against guerrilla warfare is OK, but I would prefer the walls to also be able to defend against large-scale military assaults.\n\nPeople are still using all the techniques of modern warfare; not just a wall of infantry.\n\nFirstly, it wasn't tagged reality check, but I think you need one.\n\nWalls are undesirable for modern warfare\n\nFirstly, walls mean nothing to modern large-scale military assaults. Consider the Atlantic Wall during WWII. Not a wall per se, but a network of costal defences designed to keep any invading force at bay. It was circumvented in the Battle of Normandy in part by using the third dimension.\n\nA siege with modern weapons means artillery shells, bombs dropped by planes, missiles fired from cruisers or drones, or intercontinental missiles with any payload you want. You can look at Israel, with an (alleged) state-of-the-art missile defence system, and rockets still find their way into something. I wouldn't want to stand under that Iron Dome against an enemy with more budget and more high-tech weaponry.\n\nAnd you start getting into why walls are undesirable. Walls mean siege, and obliteration over surrender. It's the exact opposite of the open city doctrine. Nobody likes to surrender, but consider the fate of Paris in 1940 with that of Berlin in 1945. French authorities didn't defend Paris. They let the invading force in without a fight. Nazis later clinged on Berlin at significant cost. And the cost here isn't just property damage and lives, it's also historical buildings, museums, and other things you can't just replace. Popular opinion is certainly going to be divided on whether it's worth the cost, but there will be a point where the cost becomes too great.\n\nIn that kind of scenario, to defend a city you need more than static defences, simply because what you might consider modern siege weapons can be placed way beyond reach of the defender. Japan in 1945 is a great example of that. Down to ships that couldn't move and planes that couldn't take off, they were unable to stop the onslaught of bombers coming at them. The US never intended to invade. They could have kept bombing the country forever, and there's nothing Japan could have done about it, because the airbases were out of reach, and the air defences were annihilated in the course of the war. The use of that brand new weapon changed nothing. Japan had already lost at least six months prior.\n\nThat's the fate of a city with walls in a modern warfare scenario. Either you have an army left outside of your walls to try and take the threat out, or you surrender (unless of course you prefer obliteration).\n\nSo, that's one thing walls are definitely not going to be used for.\n\nWall, what is it good for?\n\nIf modern city walls are going to defend against one thing, it will be natural disasters. Floods most likely. In fact, here's a modern wall. It's a cheaper solution than moving an entire city. But it's a stop-gap fix, not a solution. Maybe a downfall of civilisation scenario where the few cities left standing have to fend off against chupacabras, walls could be useful there.\n\nIf you're thinking Berlin Wall and Iron Wall, that really didn't do much to prevent the fall of the USSR and East Germany. I think it might even have been counterproductive. These walls were more symbolic than protective. What prevented an invasion was the accumulation of forces behind the walls, and/or the sheer politics of it. These walls weren't impenetrable by far.\n\nIt will be marginally useful against intrusions from private citizens, which is why we bother putting walls around important buildings. So closed cities, or some kind of modern Forbidden City, or a Green Zone. But against any moderately organised force, and as many acts of terrorism have highlighted, no amount of physical security is undefeatable. And if it is, you stab someone standing outside of the wall.\n\nAnd if it's to keep migrants out, there are many use cases to how effective it is or isn't at the scale of a country. At the scale of the city, considering you need to interact with the outside world (where there's farms and factories, i.e. where your goods and services come from), it's going to be a lot less effective.\n\nI'm not certain about the conditions which might make building walls around cities necessary or desirable, but I can say that with modern conditions of relative wealth and ease of construction compared to premodern societies building walls around cities would be comparatively easy.\n\nI'm not certain that modern people would be okay with gates where every road crosses the wall and the resulting delays in traffic if each vehicle has to stop at the gate for a check. Of course many old time cities left the gates open all day and let anyone go in or out during the day, and only closed the gates at night. That would be far more convient for modern people than stopping every vehicle for some sort of check as in an international border checking point.\n\nEuropean cities and towns and many villages usually had walls. If a city expanded or contracted its area, new walls were often built encloser larger or smaller areas.\n\nIn the USA and many other modern countries, cities have large suburbs which constantly increase and sprad out. City walls which included surburban areas would have to constantly be be expanded.\n\nBut if a sity is built with many buildings which are say, a hundred stories tall and a mile wide each, with people living on each floor of each building, or if cities are built with only skyscaper apartment buildings and no vast suburbs of single family homes, the inhabited areas of cities could be much smaller than the sprawling automobile based cities and it would be much more practical to build walls around such cities.\n\nBut anyway, building walls around cities would be practical if desired. Premodern Chinese cities were filled with houndreds and thousands of residential compounds, each with a wall around it. And sometimes each neighborhood in a large Chinese city had a wall around it. And the entire Chinse city usually had a wall around it.\n\nAnd of course the country of China often had a wall around a large part of its permimeter. The Great Wall(s) of China blocked the northern border. I don't know how many thousands of kilometers or miles the Great Wall stretched at any one time, because entirely new great walls were built from time to timeby different governments when the border was in different locations.\n\nSo I don't now whether statements about the total length of the Great Wall include the total lengths of walls built and maintained at different times over two thousand years, or only the total length of, for example, the Ming Dynasty walls.\n\nAnyway, ancient and medieval and early modern China had countles thousands of walled household compounds in the country and in cities, and coultless walls within and around cities, and often the most recent version ofthe Great Wall. It was a country with countless thousands of kilometers or miles of walls in total.\n\nIf all the other walls in China disappeared, or were never built in the first place, and the only walls that were built and maintained were the big walls around the hundreds of Chinese cities, building and maintaining those walls would have been a lot less work than building and maintaining all the walls which actually did exist in China.\n\nBenin is the name of a country in west Africa. Benin city is in the neighboring country of Nigeria, just to confuse people. And one thing which Benin City is famous for is the Walls of Benin.\n\nThe Walls of Benin are a series of earthworks made up of banks and ditches, called Iya in the Edo language, in the area around present-day Benin City, the capital of present-day Edo, Nigeria. They consist of 15 km (9.3 mi) of city iya and an estimated 16,000 kilometres (9,900 miles) of rural iya in the area around Benin.1 The 'walls' of Benin City and surrounding areas were described as \"the world's largest earthworks carried out prior to the mechanical era\" by the Guinness book of Records.2 Some estimates suggest that the walls of Benin may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE3 and others suggest that the walls of Benin (in the Esan region) may have been constructed during the first millennium CE.3\n\nThe walls were built of a ditch and dike structure; the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Benin\n\nSo if the rural walls outside of Benin city total 16,000 kilometers or 9,900 miles, and were a single wall, they could make a square 4,000 kilometers by 4,000 kilometers, or 2,475 miles by 2,475 miles. But no doubt they are a group of many hundreds or thousands of much smaller enclosures, many of them probably connected.\n\nI note that in Europe many \"dykes\" were built, which were defensive or boundry earthworks with earthern ditches and walls, similar to the Niegerian lya, except that the ditch was usually on th eouter side and the earthen wall on the inner side.\n\nI note that Schleswig-Holstein in Germany has a defensive dyke called the Danevirke built over many centuries to defend Denmark from invasion from the south. The Danevirke was last used from military purposes during the Second Schlesvig-Holstein War in 1864.\n\nThus I suspect that European type dykes or Nigerian style lya could still be used for some military or police purposes in the 21st century.\n\nI also note that walls and fences have often been used to keep wild animals or livestock inside or outside specified areas.\n\nOne form of livestock containing wall is a ha ha.\n\nA ha-ha (French: hâ-hâ or saut de loup) is a recessed landscape design element that creates a vertical barrier (particularly on one side) while preserving an uninterrupted view of the landscape beyond from the other side.\n\nThe design can include a turfed incline that slopes downward to a sharply vertical face (typically a masonry retaining wall). Ha-has are used in landscape design to prevent access to a garden by, for example, grazing livestock, without obstructing views. In security design, the element is used to deter vehicular access to a site while minimizing visual obstruction.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha-ha\n\nIn many parts of Africa and South Asia, some farms and vilages have various forms of anti elephant ditches, walls, or fences to keep elephant herds from raiding the crops.\n\nAustralia is famous for rabbit proof fences.\n\nThe State Barrier Fence of Western Australia,1 formerly known as the Rabbit Proof Fence, the State Vermin Fence, and the Emu Fence, is a pest-exclusion fence constructed between 1901 and 1907 to keep rabbits and other agricultural pests, from the east, out of Western Australian pastoral areas.2\n\nThere are three fences in Western Australia: the original No. 1 Fence crosses the state from north to south, No. 2 Fence is smaller and further west, and No. 3 Fence is smaller still and runs east–west. The fences took six years to build. When completed in 1907, the rabbit-proof fence (including all three fences) stretched 2,023 miles (3,256 km). The cost to build each kilometre of fence at the time was about $250 (equivalent to $18,906 in 2018).3\n\nWhen it was completed in 1907, the 1,139-mile (1,833 km) No. 1 Fence was the longest unbroken fence in the world.4\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit-proof_fence\n\nThe Darling Downs–Moreton Rabbit Board fence is a pest-exclusion fence constructed between 1893 and 1997 to keep rabbits out of farming areas in Queensland, Australia. It is managed by the Darling Downs–Moreton Rabbit Board1 and is often referred to as \"The Rabbit Fence\" or \"Rabbit Board Fence\".[2][failed verification]\n\nAs of 2021 the fence has been expanded to 555km of rabbit-proof fence running from Mt Gipps to Goombi.1\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs%E2%80%93Moreton_Rabbit_Board_fence\n\nThe Dingo Fence or Dog Fence is a pest-exclusion fence that was built in Australia during the 1880s and finished in 1885, to keep dingoes out of the relatively fertile south-east part of the continent (where they had largely been exterminated) and protect the sheep flocks of southern Queensland. It is one of the longest structures in the world. It stretches 5,614 kilometres (3,488 mi)1 from Jimbour on the Darling Downs near Dalby through thousands of kilometres of arid land ending west of Eyre peninsula on cliffs of the Nullarbor Plain2 above the Great Australian Bight3 near Nundroo.4\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo_Fence\n\nThere are also barriers built for enforcing laws.\n\nThe Inland Customs Line, incorporating the Great Hedge of India (or Indian Salt Hedge1), was a customs barrier built by the British colonial rulers of India to prevent smuggling of salt from coastal regions in order to avoid the substantial salt tax.\n\nThe line was gradually expanded as more territory was brought under British control until it covered more than 2,500 miles (4,000 km), often running alongside rivers and other natural barriers. It ran from the Punjab in the northwest to the princely state of Orissa, near the Bay of Bengal, in the southeast. The line was initially made of dead, thorny material such as the Indian plum but eventually evolved into a living hedge that grew up to 12 feet (3.7 m) high and was compared to the Great Wall of China. The Inland Customs Department employed customs officers, jemadars and men to patrol the line and apprehend smugglers, reaching a peak of more than 14,000 staff in 1872.\n\nThe line and hedge were abandoned in 1879 when the British seized control of the Sambhar Salt Lake in Rajasthan and applied tax at the point of manufacture.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Customs_Line\n\nSo I can imagine that even in modern times some sort of ditches, or dykes, or walls, or fences could be built around cities to keep people or animals in or out.\n\nSuch defenses would not be very good a stopping or slowing down invasions by major military forces, but could have some degree of police or military function.\n\nIt's not really about the walls, it's about the gates.\n\nThe only way to get through your wall into the city is via the handful of carefully planned and well-defended gates. These serve as natural choke points that make it easier to defend against a ground assault. It also makes it far more difficult for spies, smugglers, or enemy sympathizers to sneak into your city.\n\nYou can even build the gates such that they allow foot traffic but not vehicle traffic (hedgehogs, bollards, or similar). You said that militaries no longer use walls of infantry, so a ground assault would make heavy use of wheeled vehicles, tanks, etc. None of these can get through your gates, so an attacker would have to try to punch a vehicle-sized hole in your wall (giving you plenty of time to counterattack from the high ground) or leave the safety of their armored vehicles and charge through the gates on foot (which you could defend against using a much smaller force).\n\nThis is similar to why modern military bases or prisons have reinforced fencing, sometimes in multiple layers. In a lot of cases it's just a chain-link fence with delusions of grandeur. An attacker could destroy it if they wanted to. However, they serve as a speed bump that requires that attacker to place themselves in a vulnerable, easily-detectable position for an extended period of time. A relatively small patrol force inside the base can defeat the attackers (or at least call for reinforcements) before the attacker has time to clear the obstacle. Surprise attacks become difficult and costly, requiring you to smash through a gate and land yourself in the middle of a kill zone.\n\nIn ancient times, walls were near-impervious obstacles. That's not practical thanks to modern weapons, but walls are still useful as a means to stall an oncoming blitz, force the attacker to waste resources, give the defender time to organize, and give some degree of control over where the fight happens.\n\ndefense\n\nIf the wall is particularly thick, it could be used as a platform for placing defensive weapons onto for a better line of sight against incoming missiles, bombs, aircraft, and whatever other threats that a wall doesn't counter. Put a large amount of CIWS guns along the wall and you could have decent protection against air targets. You could also mount large fortress guns for attacking ground targets at exceptional ranges, kind of like the German flak towers used in WW2 (though those were meant mostly for attacking enemy aircraft flying overhead anyway) They could also have an internal area for housing soldiers and equipment, as well as housing civilians temporarily in case of a bombing raid or something, though you would have to be careful with ammunition. One guy not reading the \"no smoking\" sign right outside the ammo stockpile room and now you're missing a chunk of your big wall.\n\nAnother thing, if were talking about near future tech, Laser anti munition system or LAMS. A wall is pretty big, perfect for having a place to charge up a giant laser ready to melt incoming projectiles.\n\nmorale reasons\n\nA giant wall would raise people's spirits hiding behind the wall and lower their spirits outside of it. To the people living in the city, it would be \"we are safe, we are protected from the enemy by this giant wall\" and to the enemy its \"man we have to assault this huge wall covered in guns and swarming with soldiers\" Morale is important in siege warfare, even though there aren't really sieges anymore.\n\nconclusion\n\nfor a wall to not only be viable but also for it to make any sense it would have to be VERY well defended from both air and ground targets and have to be VERY sturdy. it would only exist for siege warfare like when cannons were becoming tools that could crack castles wide open. Essentially, \"we know that given enough time and enough pressure, we will lose this siege if we don't have any reinforcements, but how long is the enemy willing to sit here and how much are they willing to give up taking this city?\""
