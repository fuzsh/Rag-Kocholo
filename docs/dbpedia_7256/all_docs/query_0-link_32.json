        "text": "When These Walls Come Tumbling Down is the sixth episode of the first season, and the sixth episode overall.\n\nOfficial Synopsis[]\n\nAn eager protégé undermines his mentor on the council as a magical tech rapidly evolves. With authorities in pursuit, Jinx must face her past. [1]\n\nPlot[]\n\nWe flash back to a scene from Viktor's childhood. While other children swim in the water, Viktor winds up a mechanical toy boat. He is seen briefly by Sky, but the girl soon returns to playing with the other kids. Viktor sets the boat in the water and it begins sailing downstream. As it picks up speed with the current, Viktor is unable to keep up with it due to his bad leg. It descends into a cave, but Viktor follows it. When it finally comes to rest, it is found by Singed, who is sitting in the cave with his pet waverider, Rio. Viktor inquires about the creature, and Singed explains that Rio is a rare mutation he cultivated, and that while she is dying, he is working to save her. Viktor offers to help, and Singed accepts.\n\nBack in the present day, Viktor sits on a ledge overlooking the same pool of water from his youth. Heimerdinger approaches, remembering the day he first met Viktor here, and offers his condolences for Viktor's prognosis. Viktor expresses envy for the professor's long and remarkable life. Heimerdinger tells him that he should be proud of his accomplishments, but Viktor believes his work will be short-lived.\n\nJayce walks in on Mel painting a picture of the Immortal Bastion from her home nation of Noxus. He apologizes for disappearing the previous night, but she remains irate. After a moment, he breaks the news that Viktor is dying. He theorizes that his illness is due to the gases he was exposed to while living in Zaun, lamenting that he wants to solve real issues, not just trade disputes, and hates feeling so useless. Mel admits that she's an exile from her family, having fallen short of \"Medarda standards.\" She tells Jayce that he should be with Viktor, saying that while we can't change fate, we don't have to face it alone.\n\nViktor stares endlessly, pondering the hex core. He begins to notice how it's changed after absorbing his blood. He touches it with his finger, and it reacts violently, causing his consciousness to slip once again.\n\nJinx visits the bar at The Last Drop. The bartender, Thieram, seems terrified of her, but pours her a drink as she pries him for information. He reveals that Silco's henchmen are searching for two women who \"did a number\" on Sevika. Jinx thanks him by attaching a grenade to his back, though it only explodes in glitter.\n\nCaitlyn and Vi continue to elude the henchmen, but Vi can barely walk due to her wound. They come to the edge of a cliffside with an abandoned water tower situated at the bottom, metal supports reaching all the way up the rock wall. Vi jumps across the beams to reach the bottom, though her condition makes her sloppy. Caitlyn follows slowly. Standing on a distant structure, the Firelight leader sees them descend. A group of henchmen sprint past the water tower, not thinking to check the hiding place below.\n\nSevika enters Silco's office, saying, \"We lost her.\" The chair swivels around to reveal Jinx in Silco's seat, and she asks who they lost. Sevika steps forward, stumbling into a tripwire and releasing a noxious green gas. Jinx dons a gas mask as Sevika attempts to reach her, but passes out. Some time later, Jinx slaps her awake; she's tied down to Silco's chair. Jinx subtly threatens to cut off her remaining arm, but Sevika is unfazed. She explains that Vi is back in town alongside an enforcer, claiming that it's only a matter of time before Jinx \"implodes\" and Silco \"gets the message\" that she's unreliable. Jinx feigns crying, but sneezes in Sevika's face, exclaiming that she knows \"just how to deliver that message.\"\n\nMarcus returns home and goes to check on his daughter, Ren. He finds her building a tower of blocks with Silco and two of his thugs. Silco reveals that Vi is loose in Zaun with an enforcer (he had been under the impression that Marcus killed her, not locked her in prison). Marcus identifies the enforcer as Caitlyn, a Kiramman clanswoman and therefore granted certain privileges that Marcus, as sheriff, cannot supersede. Nevertheless, he promises to \"fix this\" but Silco opts to do it for him. Though it goes unspoken, all adults in the room are aware that Silco means to harm Ren if Marcus fails him. Silco misplaces a block, bringing the tower tumbling down, unconvincingly pretending it was an accident.\n\nViktor demonstrates to Jayce that the hex core responds to organic matter, causing a small plant to experience massive growth, multiplying in size in a matter of seconds. Viktor theorizes that the hex core could lead to healing magic, which could augment physiology and extend life. Jayce surmises that it may be the key to saving Viktor's life, but the plant withers and dies moments later. Viktor explains that he's had the same result with every plant he's tried, but doesn't know why. He fears he may be running out of time. Trying to remain hopeful, Jayce offers to ask Heimerdinger for help.\n\nCaitlyn helps Vi to her feet. They stand before a large encampment of vagrants, all of whom appear malnourished or deformed, shying away from Caitlyn's flashlight. They turn away, retreating into the house at the base of the water tower. Caitlyn helps Vi onto a bench and reaches to dab her face with a handkerchief, but Vi swats her away. Vi is fading, and begins to see visions of her childhood, when she and Powder lived in this house with their parents. Caitlyn wants Vi to trust her, not seeming to understand why she hates Piltovans so much. Eventually, Vi allows Caitlyn to stem her still-bleeding wound with the handkerchief.\n\nViktor and Jayce introduce Heimerdinger to the hex core. They explain its various functions, but Heimerdinger is distracted. He says that he's seen nations destroyed by arcane forces which looked \"exactly like this\" and insists that the hex core be destroyed. Jayce vehemently opposes him, saying that the hex core could save Viktor's life. Heimerdinger claims that this is a violation of the Ethos and vows to have it destroyed one way or another, storming away in anger. Viktor says he knows someone else who could help, but Jayce says he needs to get ready, to which Viktor asks, \"For what?\"\n\nVi starts to lose consciousness entirely. Caitlyn exits the house but is startled to find Huck standing there, asking if Vi is all right. Caitlyn trains her rifle on Huck, but he assures her that he's a friend, owing his life to Vi's father. Caitlyn tells him that Vi needs a doctor. Huck explains that doctors are scarce around here, but he may know someone who can help. He beckons Caitlyn to follow him into the camp, where they arrive at an apothecary's stall. Huck explains that the apothecary makes potions to help with \"this,\" shamefully gesturing to the deformed purple growths on his body caused by the overuse of shimmer. The apothecary brings forth a potion, asking for a trade. Caitlyn empties the bullets from her rifle and passes it to the woman. In response, she adds a single drop of shimmer to the potion and slides it to Caitlyn. Caitlyn invites Huck to meet Vi, but Huck doesn't want Vi to see him \"like this.\" She embraces him in a hug before returning to the house.\n\nMarcus gives Jinx's grenade to Jayce, falsely stating that he found it on one of the Firelights and that he has reason to expect more attacks, though he's unsure how to stop them aside from \"searching everyone who crosses the bridges.\" Jayce says that that's exactly what they'll do. Marcus is hesistant, but Jayce insists. He also inquires about the prisoner Caitlyn released on Jayce's order, asking if there's anything he can help with, but Jayce dismisses him, saying he's \"got it covered.\"\n\nLater, at a Council meeting, Heimerdinger waxes poetic on how Piltover has lost its way, saying that greed and complacence have divided the once-united city. He urges the councilors to hold each other accountable, but Jayce retorts by asking who will hold Heimerdinger accountable. He berates the professor for failing to contain shimmer and violence in the undercity, accusing him of obstructing others' plans but never formulating his own. He continuously attacks the professor until at last, he moves that Heimerdinger be expelled from the Council. Such a motion must be unanimous, but in the end, every other councilor supports Jayce's proposal. Heimerdinger appears incredibly hurt and betrayed as his days on the Council come to a halt.\n\nCaitlyn feeds the potion to a barely conscious Vi. She screams awake, eyes briefly turning purple from the shimmer, and notices that her wound has stopped bleeding almost immediately. Caitlyn refocuses on finding Jinx, the name given to Vi by Sevika. She leans against a support beam, but quickly stands up straight as the entire tower creaks unsteadily. She notices that the beam is marked with various heights labeled \" Violet\" and \" Powder,\" realizing that Vi used to live here. She asks who Powder is, and Vi explains that it's her sister whom she needs to find. The conversation leads to Vi revealing that her parents were killed by enforcers.\n\nA commotion stirs, prompting Vi and Caitlyn to follow the noise outside. Silco is standing there with his thugs, holding vials of shimmer over a small crowd of vagrants. He drops the vials, leading the addicts to imbibe the drug voraciously. They begin to transform, marching towards Vi mindlessly. Caitlyn starts pushing on the support beam in an attempt to bring the water tower down. Vi promises to save her sister and destroy Silco's empire, turning to slam her fist into the beam, finally beginning the tower's collapse.\n\nFrom atop a distant tower in Zaun, Jinx holds the flare that Vi gave her when she was a child. She ignites it, sending blue smoke skyward, determined to attract Vi's attention.\n\nVi and Caitlyn escape in the chaos as the water tower falls apart. Enraged, Silco sends his henchmen after them and kicks Huck into the dirt until he stops moving. Vi and Caitlyn reenter the city proper, and Vi spots Jinx's plume of smoke.\n\nMarcus erects a blockade upon every bridge between Piltover and Zaun, illuminated by floodlights, with the intent of searching all who pass.\n\nBack in Viktor's childhood, the boy arrives at Singed's lab with a crate full of flowers to feed Rio. However, he finds Rio in severe pain, flailing on the ground, her body hooked up to a series of tubes. He embraces Rio in empathy, horrified at what Singed has done. Singed says he \"thought [Viktor] understood,\" and that the mutation must survive. Disgusted, Viktor absconds, trampling over the flowers as he goes.\n\nReturning once more to the present day, Singed has contained Rio within a massive glass jar full of green liquid, her unmoving body still connected to various tubes. An adult Viktor limps into Singed's lab, saying, \"I understand now.\" Singed turns to face him, his visage scarred and burnt by the fire set by Powder all those years ago.\n\nSilco retreats to his office, venting about how many problems \"one girl\" can cause. He sees a dagger stuck in his desk: on it, an arrow pointing upward, drawn in crayon. He looks up. Dangling from the ceiling is Sevika's unconscious body, vandalized with crude graffiti, including the word \"liar\" numerous times.\n\nEventually, Jinx's flare burns out, prompting her to angrily throw it to the ground below as she examines her stolen hex crystal. Finally, Vi arrives. Reunited at last, the sisters embrace in tears. The crystal slips from Jinx's grasp and clatters to the floor. She tells Vi that she's changed since Vi left, but Vi assures her that she still loves her deeply.\n\nCaitlyn catches up a moment later, prompting Jinx to draw Pow-Pow, pointed at Caitlyn. Jinx realizes that Sevika wasn't lying about Vi being with an enforcer, while Caitlyn sees the crystal and realizes that Vi's sister is Jinx. Vi attempts to calm both parties down, but Jinx becomes hostile, surmising that Vi is playing a cruel trick. Vi continuously refers to her sister as Powder, causing her to angrily assert that her name is Jinx now. She accuses Vi of manipulating her in order to obtain the hex crystal, but Vi insists she doesn't even recognize the gemstone. Jinx hears a strange noise in the distance, and suddenly, the Firelights appear.\n\nJinx opens fire on the masked hoverboarders, with Vi covering her back and fighting to fend them off. Caitlyn seizes the hex crystal before it can roll off the tower, but is then knocked unconscious by a Firelight. As the battle continues, Vi is disturbed at how unhinged and violent her sister has become, and while Vi is distracted, a Firelight knocks her out as well. Another Firelight slashes at Jinx's leg, leaving a gash. Finally, the gangsters deploy a smoke bomb and disappear with Caitlyn and Vi. Having lost her sister once again, Jinx cries out in agony.\n\nContributions[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDuring Viktor's flashback, he meets Singed and his pet waverider named Rio. Rio was originally released in the game Teamfight Tactics as an alternate skin for Piximander Little Legend.\n\nThe sewer lids that eject waste to Zaun have a skull-like shape resembling Viktor's post-augmentation mask.\n\nThe image Mel is painting is the The Immortal Bastion of Noxus.\n\nThe shot pans to Viktor sitting in a scene resembling the living structures of The Void.\n\nIn the bar scene, Jinx calls Thieram \"Chuck\" as a habit.\n\nThieram was initially introduced in The Last Drop showcased in the RiotX Arcane online visual novel.\n\nIn Marcus' daughter's room, Ren,there are several references:\n\nUrf plushie on the bed.\n\nHouse of cards in colors similar to cards used by Twisted Fate.\n\nA Teemo children's book.\n\nA teddy bear resembling Annie's Tibbers.\n\nA witch toy resembling Sorceress Lux skin (non-canonical easter egg).\n\nDuring the Battle on the platform with the Firelights gang, a crow appears perched on the pipes.\n\nMedia[]"
