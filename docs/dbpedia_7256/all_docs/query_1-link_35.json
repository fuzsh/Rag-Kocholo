        "text": "Abbey Road is probably the most famous music studio in the world, largely because The Beatles named an album after it. It certainly has the most famous pedestrian crossing in the world, immortalised on the cover of that incredible recording, and now a shrine to fans and a daily frustration to drivers in north London.\n\nI’ve crossed it many times myself, and it always feels like a thrilling privilege to pass through the gates of number 3, walk across the yard and mount the stairs of this white-fronted Georgian townhouse, gaining admittance to hallowed ground. It is a magical labyrinth inside, with corridors and stairwells lined with vintage recording machines, walls decorated by framed photographs of the musicians who used them, and doors opening onto odd spaces where some of the greatest music ever heard first came to life.\n\n“If these walls could sing, eh?” says Paul McCartney with a heavy wink during Disney+’s over-reverent yet oddly incurious documentary about the studio where he forged his reputation. It is impossible to escape the feeling that Macca is not so much spontaneously minting this catchy title phrase but rather dropping it clunkily into the conversation as a favour to the filmmaker, his daughter Mary.\n\nThe 53-year-old Mary McCartney has established a fine reputation as a talented photographer in the heavy shadows of her famous parents. Documentary-making is a natural next career step, albeit a chief qualification for helming this was presumably access to the contact book of the studio’s most famous living alumnus. Paul duly trots out over-familiar Beatles anecdotes, with an odd quality of paternal indulgence. Elton John tells a story intended to flatter Paul, as if Mary can be relied upon to pass it on (which she does in the closing credits). Liam and Noel Gallagher talk (separately, of course, to avoid unpleasantness) about the spiritual quality of recording in the home of the Beatles, drawing a veil over the unfortunate fact that the only album Oasis made at Abbey Road was their fractious 2008 swan song, Dig Out Your Soul, released less than a year before they broke up in acrimony.\n\nAll the celebrity talking heads seem to be on best behaviour, as you might expect when addressing the daughter of an important friend. Mary herself talks wistfully about the studio as a home from home, referencing her father’s sheepdog Martha, the subject of Beatles’ song Martha My Dear, which (Fabs fans will surely know) was actually recorded in Trident Studios. For a film about the hot centre of a rock and roll revolution, it is all a bit cosy.\n\nNevertheless, with subject matter this rich, you are never far from some fantastic footage and a fascinating anecdote. Jimmy Page’s account of recording Goldfinger as session guitarist for Shirley Bassey is hugely entertaining (she collapsed in a theatrical faint after the final sustained note), there is scintillating footage of cellist Jacqueline du Pré recording her final sessions and a revealing tale about Burt Bacharach’s perfectionism as he made Cilla Black sing 31 takes of Alfie. Amid the general lovie-ness, ex-members of Pink Floyd remain reliably thorny, with Roger Waters and David Gilmour still carping through teeth-gritting English politeness 40 years since they were last forced to share studio space. And, of course, the Beatles footage, photos and music remain supernaturally uplifting.\n\nStrange, then, that a film with such access should seem so slight. Too in thrall to celebrity cameos, it fails to shine much light on the background workers, engineers, technicians, producers and session players essential to the magic unfolding. Made with the studio’s cooperation as part of a promotional drive (see also David Hepworth’s recent book, Abbey Road NW8), the film is too polite to address Abbey Road’s status essentially as a legacy business.\n\nEstablished as a studio in 1931 when Edward Elgar conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, its golden period was 1958 to 1975 (Cliff Richard’s Move It to Pink Floyd’s Wish You Were Here). The Pet Shop Boys, Radiohead and Florence and the Machine have done good work within its walls in more recent decades, but as studios themselves become increasingly redundant in this era of digital computer recording, Abbey Road has become part of rock’s heritage spot, where wealthy established musicians can go to conjure proximity to former greatness. If these walls could sing, would anybody still be listening?\n\nIf These Walls Could Sing is on Disney+ now"
