        "text": "I saw this film at the Crazy 8's screening in Vancouver in the Spring. I thought it was going to be a scary film but it made me feel more angry than scared. It made me think about all the stories left untold. My gran and mom and aunties had talked about babies being buried around the Indian residential schools. I hear some bits and pieces on the news about this stuff but then the stories disappear. I want my family to see this film. We know what the truth is and know that the stories will come out and won't just disappear. I wish it was on TV so that more people could see it. I would also like to see a longer version of this film. I want to know what happened to the priests and what happened to Mary and her mother. I hope you keep making films, someone needs to tell our stories. Thanks."
