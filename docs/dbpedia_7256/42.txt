If These Walls Could Talk

Nancy Savoca’s and Cher’s star-studded episodic film presents a critical view of the ever-growing conservative forces in America that, on the one hand, scorn consultation and advice about contracaption as "immoral” and, on the other hand, bring up the guns against abortion. The film tells the story of three women who live in the same house in different decades and who are all confronted with the problem of an unwanted pregnancy. In 1952 the newly widowed nurse Clare goes and sees a back-street abortionist in order to put an end to her pregnancy. After giving birth to three children, Barbara at last has the realistic hope of finding a job again, but then a new pregnancy thwarts her plans. In 1974 abortion is already legal; however, this fact does not make it any easier for Barbara to take the right decision. In 1996 Christine, a student, consults an abortion clinic to get information on abortion. While doing this, she is being harassed by militant anti-abortionists.
