CRN recently visited Moscow, where Kaspersky Lab officials gave the press a tour of their new facility. Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of the security firm, said the facility was officially opened in March. The company had been renting office space at its former location for more than a decade.

Spanning several stories, the new facility stands beside the Moscow River and has office space for approximately 1,500 employees. It contains the central "war room," where threat engineers reverse engineer malware, flag suspicious files for further analysis and create antivirus signatures for the firm's security products.
