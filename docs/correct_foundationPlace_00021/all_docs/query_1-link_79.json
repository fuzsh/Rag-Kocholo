        "text": "Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Lab listed their take on the year's top security stories on Monday. And two quick takeaways: the cloud is dead, encryption services will come back strong.\n\nNo surprise, the IT firm led by the charismatic Eugene Kaspersky put cyber espionage on the top of their list. This year saw a steady flow of blockbuster news about U.S. spy agencies eavesdropping on their political buddies from Brazil to Germany. Even secure governments have lost their privacy.\n\nLast October, Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research & Analysis Team investigated a series of attacks against computer networks of various international diplomatic service agencies. A large scale cyber-espionage network was revealed and analyzed during the investigation: they called it Operation Red October, named after the Tom Clancy novel about a Soviet submarine captain titled \"The Hunt For The Red October\".\n\nKaspersky does not say who was beyond the attacks.\n\nRed October was not the only cyber spying program out there this year. MiniDuke stole data from government agencies and research institutions in at least 59 high profile organizations in 23 countries, including the US. Another: NetFile-801, aka NetTraveler. The program was used to compromise more than 350 organizations across 40 countries – including Russia, India and China. The targets were state organizations, including embassies, oil and gas companies, research institutions, military contractors and activists.\n\n\"This year showed that everybody is in the same boat,\" said Costin Raiu, Director of Global Research and Analysis for Kaspersky Lab. \"Any organization or person can become a victim. Not all attacks involve high profile targets, or those involved in critical infrastructure. Those who hold data could be of value to cyber criminals, or they can be used as a stepping-stone to reach other targets,\" he said.\n\nOther than the cyber espionage programs taking the most intriguing story in cyber space this year, here's the remaining on the Kaspersky Lab list.\n\nThe Cyber Mercenary\n\nAdvanced Persistent Threat malware campaigns like IceFog is high on the list. They've most performed quick hit and run data theft in Asia. The Chinese group ‘Hidden Lynx’, whose activities were reported by researchers at Symantec in September, also fall into the same mercenary category. They were responsible for an attack on Massachusetts based cyber security firm Bit9 earlier this year.\n\nThe Hactivists\n\nThis includes groups like Anonymous, targeting private and government computer systems, usually tied to a national protest going on at the time. One of the weapons of choice for those who have an ax to grind is the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack. The biggest was directed at the Spamhaus Project in March. It was estimated that the attack reached a throughput of 300 gigabits per second. The secretive internet service provider, CyberBunker, was first suspected of launching the attack because they have been battling with Spamhaus for the past two years. And CyberBunker was blacklisted by Spamhaus a few weeks before the incident began. The owners of Cyberbunker denied responsibility, but claimed to be a spokesperson for those behind it. While some of the apocalyptic \"nuclear bomb\" headlines overstated the true effects of this attack, the incident -- regardless of who orchestrated it -- highlights the impact a determined attacker can have on the internet.\n\nRansomware\n\n‘Ransomware’ programs operate like a computer-specific ‘denial-of-service’ attack – they block access to a computer’s file system, or they encrypt data files stored on the computer. The modus operandi can vary. In areas where levels of software piracy are high, for example, ransomware Trojans may claim to have identified unlicensed software on the victim's computer and demand payment to regain access to the computer. The Trojan named CryptoLocker was ransomware. It's been described as the most dangerous ransomware to pop up so far. Normally the threats are for money and the malware does not infect a computer after the ransom is paid up. Once paid, the malware files are removed from the computer by the host and so far the cyber criminals behind the program have not reinfected computers after the ransom is paid. But Crypto copy cats might not be so generous...\n\nMobile Malware\n\nThe malware targeting mobile devices mirrors the malware commonly found on infected desktops and laptops – backdoors, Trojans and Trojan-Spies. The one exception is SMS -Trojan programs – a category exclusive to smartphones. The threat isn’t just growing in volume, wrote Raiu and his colleague David Emm , a senior Kaspersky researcher in London. \" We’re seeing increased complexity. In June we analyzed the most sophisticated mobile malware Trojan we’ve seen to-date, named Obad. The threat is multi-functional: it sends messages to premium rate numbers, downloads and installs other malware, uses Bluetooth to send itself to other devices and remotely performs commands at the console.\" Check your mobile phone bill.\n\nThe Watering Hole\n\nThe watering-hole attack is used by cybe r criminals as a replacement for spear-phishing and other methods. One such attack was reported on a Tibetan refugee NGO called the Tibetan Homes Foundation. Their web site was compromised in order to distribute backdoors signed with stolen certificates. This was a classic case of a watering-hole attack – the cyber criminals had researched the preferred sites of their victims and compromised them in order to infect their computers. The technique was used again in August, when code on the Central Tibetan Administration web site started to redirect Chinese-speaking visitors to a Java exploit that dropped a backdoor used as part of a targeted attack. You don't need to be a multi-national corporation, or other high-profile organization, to become the victim of the watering-hole strategy.\n\nThe End of Privacy\n\nAlthough many people have given up their private lives by expressing their likes and dislikes on social media every day, the big picture is somewhat different. And the poster child for that big picture is the NSA's \"most wanted\", Edward Snowden, the man behind numerous U.S. government leaks about agency spying on friendly nations.\n\nOne of the first visible effects of the Snowden saga was the shutdown of the encrypted Lavabit e-mail service. Silent Circle, another encrypted e-mail provider, decided to shut down their service as well, leaving very few options for private and secure e-mail exchange. The reason why these two services shut down was their inability to provide such services under pressure from governmental agencies. Privacy is now a luxury.\n\nIn September, Belgacom, a Belgian telecommunications operator announced it was hacked. During a routine investigation, Belgacom staff identified an unknown virus in a number of servers and employee computers. Later, speculations appeared about the origin of the virus and the attack, which pointed towards the NSA. Although samples of the malware have not been made available to the security industry, further details appeared which indicate the attack took place through compromised a staffer's personal LinkedIn page that had been booby-trapped through man-in-the-middle techniques, with links pointing to computer network exploitation servers.\n\nBitcoin Under Attack\n\nOne way to be private is cash. Another way is virtual cash, or bitcoin. But bitcoin is falling prey to malware writers. Brazilian cyber criminals are trying to impersonate Bitcoin exchange houses. Bitcoin mining botnets have also appeared, as well as malware designed to steal Bitcoin wallets.\n\nOn Friday, October 25, a joint operation between the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency shut down the infamous cyber Silk Road. Silk Road was a closed, private online network designed to enable its users to buy and sell illegal drugs. It was operating on Bitcoins, which allowed both sellers and customers to remain anonymous. The FBI and DEA seized about 140,000 Bitcoins (worth approximately $56 million) from “Dread Pirate Roberts”, Silk Road’s operator. Founded in 2011, Silk Road was operating through the TOR Onion network, having amassed over 9.5 million in bit coin sales revenue.\n\nAlthough it’s clear that cyber criminals have found safe havens in Bitcoins, there are also many other users who have no malicious intentions. Yet, as Bitcoin becomes more popular, it will be interesting to see whether governments crackdown on the exchanges in a bid to put a stop to criminal elements operating in their midst.\n\nNext year will be about rebuilding trust in the internet. With lackluster trust now, new companies will sprout up, either legit or off-the-reservation, to protect privacy.\n\n\"Privacy will be a hot subject, with its ups and downs,\" said Raiu. \"Encryption will be back in fashion and we believe countless new services will appear, claiming to keep you safe from prying eyes. The Cloud, the wonder child of previous years, is now forgotten as people have lost trust and countries begin thinking more seriously about privacy implications,\" he said.\n\nNext year, financial markets will probably feel the ripples of Bitcoin, as massive amounts of money are constantly being pumped into the virtual currency from China and elsewhere.\n\nRaiu speculates that Bitcoin could reach $10,000, or perhaps crash as people start looking for more trustworthy, and less dramatic alternatives."
