        "text": "Monday was a busy news day. Judge Cannon’s verdict dismissed Jack Smith’s document case on the opening day of the Republican convention at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks. The anticipation was palpable over who former President Trump, the 2024 GOP presidential candidate, would choose as his running mate. At 3:04 p.m., Trump ended the suspense with his announcement on Truth Social that Ohio Senator JD Vance would be his running mate, a decision that will undoubtedly shape the future of U.S. politics.\n\nAmericans are now more conscious than ever about the importance of the vice-presidential pick, fueled by recent concerns over President Joe Biden's apparent mental infirmities.\n\nFor context, the TIPP Poll tested Trump's shortlist of potential running mates earlier this month. Senator Vance finished fourth behind more well-known personalities like Dr. Ben Carson, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator Tim Scott, all of whom had previously been presidential candidates in 2016 or 2024.\n\nWith Trump’s support, the 39-year-old Vance defeated Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan (53% to 47%) in the 2022 midterm election to become Ohio’s senator. In the Senate, Vance has strongly supported Trump, espousing populist, conservative ideology.\n\nJ.D. served in the Marine Corps and graduated Summa Cum Laude from Ohio State University. He is a Yale Law School graduate and was the editor of The Yale Law Journal. His bestselling book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” was adapted into a movie. After Yale, he worked at Mithril Capital, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, the former PayPal CEO.\n\nBirds of a feather flock together. If you're unfamiliar with Vance, Donald Trump Jr. is a staunch Vance supporter. Tucker Carlson supported Vance’s 2022 Senate run and holds him in high regard, saying:\n\nI feel like I’ve got a really good sense of senators, and he’s by far the smartest and the deepest of any I’ve ever met.\n\nOn the other hand, Senator Mitt Romney told his biographer in 2022, as Vance was running for the Senate:\n\nI don’t know that I can disrespect someone more than J.D. Vance.\n\nDemocrats are likely to recall Vance’s earlier positions that have changed. Vance was initially skeptical of Trump before becoming a supporter. In 2016, he wrote an essay in The Atlantic about the drug problems in Ohio, arguing that Trump was not the solution. In the essay, he said:\n\nTrump is cultural heroin. He makes some feel better for a bit, but he cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it.\n\nVance passes the litmus test by sharing concerns about election integrity and the 2020 election, which aligns with Trump’s core beliefs. Appearing on Stephanopoulos’s show in February this year, Vance said he would have acted differently than Mike Pence:\n\nIf I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that’s what we should have done.\n\nVance is skeptical about U.S. involvement in Ukraine. He is also concerned about the \"as long as it takes\" war and the unending U.S. aid amid a $35 trillion debt. He believes Ukraine must end its stance and negotiate a settlement with Russia.\n\nDuring a June Fox News interview, Vance described his vision for the economy:\n\nWe need a lot more manufacturing jobs than we have right now. If you look at the economies that really, really thrive, they've got a foundation of strong manufacturing. They're developing their own energy.\n\nVance's selection as Trump's running mate carries significant electoral weight for the GOP ticket. His appeal in Midwest battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, coupled with his successful track record in Ohio, could potentially sway the outcome of the 2024 election. Furthermore, Vance’s youth is a considerable advantage, attracting voters who may have previously supported Biden. Vance’s connections to Silicon Valley also help the GOP.\n\nJ.D. Vance offers great promise and is a smart, thoughtful pick by Trump. His lack of experience in governance is compensated by his achievements and successful business career in technology and finance. With training under Trump, America may look at eight years of J.D. Vance as president after Trump."
