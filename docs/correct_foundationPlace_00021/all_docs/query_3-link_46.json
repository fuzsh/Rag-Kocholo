        "text": "Days before a ban on sales of its security software was set to take effect, Kaspersky announced it would end its U.S. operations.\n\nAs first reported Monday by Zero Day's Kim Zetter, the security software giant is \"gradually\" closing its U.S. business and laying off fewer than 50 employees.\n\nA note on the Kaspersky homepage confirmed its U.S. exit, as well as announced a free software giveaway for existing customers as a parting gift:\n\nTo our lovely you [sic]\n\nThank you for choosing and trusting Kaspersky throughout the years. We're deeply moved with all the kind words and supportive messages received in these difficult times.\n\nWe've always strived and remain committed to provide the best cybersecurity there is -- independent, transparent and expertly managed. Unfortunately, for now, you have one less choice in defending yourself against online threats.\n\nWith Kaspersky leaving the U.S., we'd like to pay you back with the least we can: gifting you a selection of our security solutions for free for 6 months. They will be waiting for you in My Kaspersky.\n\nAnd while we are gone, here are some tips:\n\nRemember to always back up your data.\n\nBe wary of links and double-check their source before clicking.\n\nProtect your identity online, change passwords regularly and keep them long and complex.\n\nYours,\n\nKaspersky Team\n\nThe news comes less than one month after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a nationwide ban on all sales of Kaspersky security software. That ban is set to take effect on July 20, at which point the sale, resale, integration and licensing of any Kaspersky software will become subject to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nA subsequent ban on Kaspersky-issued security patches and software updates will take effect on Sept. 29.\n\nThe ban does not apply to Kaspersky's consulting services, nor to products in the Kaspersky Threat Intelligence or Kaspersky Security Training portfolios. Existing Kaspersky software customers will also not be penalized for continuing to use their products after the aforementioned dates.\n\nThe U.S. ban was the result of a \"lengthy and thorough investigation\" by the Department of Commerce that found Kaspersky, an antivirus software provider with over 400 million users worldwide, posed an \"unacceptable risk\" to the United States due to its ties to Russia. Kaspersky's eponymous parent company is headquartered in Moscow, raising concerns that it could be used as a tool for cyberespionage by the Russian government.\n\nKaspersky initially responded to the ban by denying it has any ties to the Russian government and accusing the Department of Commerce of acting \"based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns, rather than on a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky's products and services.\" It also promised to \"pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.\"\n\nBased on Monday's announcement, however, Kaspersky may have exhausted all of its available options to do business in the United States.\n\nKaspersky had been in the U.S. government's crosshairs for some time. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a ban on nearly all things Kaspersky for the entire U.S. federal government. In 2022, Kaspersky landed on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s running list of products that pose significant national security risks.\n\nIn announcing the nationwide Kaspersky ban last month, the Department of Commerce said it was only \"the first of many\" such moves it plans to make to protect U.S. cybersecurity interests."
