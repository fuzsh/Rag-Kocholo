        "text": "The Biden administration has implemented a ban on Kaspersky, a prominent Russia-based cybersecurity firm, from distributing its antivirus products within the United States.\n\nThis decision, issued by the U.S. Commerce Department, comes after extensive investigations revealed serious national security risks associated with the company’s operations.\n\nReasons for ban\n\nThe ban stems from concerns that Kaspersky’s ties to the Russian government could enable exploitation of sensitive U.S. information.\n\nAccording to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Russia has a history of leveraging Russian companies like Kaspersky for cyber espionage.\n\nRussia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponise sensitive U.S. information\n\nThe U.S commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo\n\nKaspersky’s response\n\nKaspersky, in response, criticized the decision as being influenced by geopolitical tensions rather than factual evidence.\n\nThe company emphasized its contributions to cybersecurity, asserting it does not engage in activities that threaten U.S. national security.\n\nKaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted US interests and allies\n\nKaspersky\n\nPolicy background\n\nThis ban marks the first major action under powers granted by an executive order during the Trump administration, enabling scrutiny of companies posing national security risks.\n\nOperational impact\n\nWhile the ban prohibits Kaspersky from selling antivirus software in the U.S. and adds affiliated entities to a national security concern list, it allows for continued antivirus updates until Sept. 29 to minimize disruption.\n\nGlobal presence and users\n\nDespite being headquartered in Moscow, Kaspersky operates globally with significant user bases across 31 countries and services millions of clients.\n\nAdvice to users\n\nThe Commerce Department encourages current users to transition to alternative cybersecurity providers, though the decision does not legally restrict continued use of Kaspersky products."
