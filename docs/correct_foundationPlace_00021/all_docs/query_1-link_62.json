If you have questions or need assistance on trade law matters, please contact Jeff Snyder or any member of the International Trade Group.\n\nTop Trade Developments\n\nLatest Russia Sanctions/Export Highlights\n\nRussia Sanctions: The U.S. (BIS) added a number of entities to the Entity List citing their support of the Russian and Belarusian militaries. Over the April 1 weekend, the world began to learn of the atrocities in Bucha. The U.S., UK, and EU have since responded with a number of new sanctions and restrictions.\n\nNew U.S. Prohibitions and Expanded Authority: On April 6, 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order (EO) that prohibits all “new investment in the Russian Federation by a United States person, wherever located.” The EO also permits the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) to prohibit the provision of “any category of services,” as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to persons located in Russia. Treasury has not provided any guidance about categories of services subject to this prohibition.\n\nU.S. Entity List Designations: On April 1, 2022, the U.S. (BIS) added 120 entities to the Entity List for supporting the Russian and Belarusian militaries. A “footnote 3” designation was added to 95 of the entities that were determined to be “military end users.” The footnote 3 designation subjects those entities to the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDP Rule). As discussed in our March 3, 2022 update, the FDP Rule restricts the export to Russia and Belarus of most foreign manufactured goods that use U.S.-origin software or technology as part of their manufacturing processes.\n\nFinancial Sector Restrictions: This week, the U.S. fully blocked Russia’s largest financial institution, Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (“Sberbank”), and Russia’s largest privately-owned financial institution, Joint Stock Company Alfa-Bank (“Alfa-Bank”). Both banks were previously subject to more limited sectoral sanctions, but are now both Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs). 42 Sberbank subsidiaries, six Alfa-Bank subsidiaries, and five vessels owned by one of Alfa-Bank’s subsidiaries were also added to the SDN List. The U.S. clarified that Alfa-Bank (Ukraine) is not subject to sanctions, because it is a distinct legal entity from Alfa-Bank. Separately, the UK designated Credit Bank of Moscow, and Sberbank.\n\nU.S. Sanctions on Russian State-Owned Enterprises: The U.S. designated two state-owned enterprises: (1) Alrosa, the world’s largest diamond company; (2) Joint Stock Company United Shipbuilding Corporation (“USC”), which manufactures Russian military warships, as well as the subsidiaries and board members of each.\n\nSanctioned Oligarchs and Other Individuals: The UK identified eight new oligarchs as subject to an asset freeze including: Leonid Mikhelson, who is associated with SIBUR, a petrochemical company; Viatcheslav Kantor, the Chair of Acron, a fertilizer company; Andrey Guryev, former Deputy Chair at PhosAgro, a phosphate-based fertilizer company; and several leaders of already designated entities.\n\nThe U.S. added the remaining members of Russia’s Security Council, including former president Dmitri Medvedev, to the SDN List. It also designated family members of Russian officials. Both the U.S. and UK placed sanctions on President Putin’s adult daughters.\n\nAdditional EU Sanctions: Media reports indicate that the EU has approved a fifth round of sanctions; however, the legislation has not been published. We expect the official record to be released as early as April 8, 2022.\n\nFor more information, contact: Jeff Snyder, Carlton Greene, Dj Wolff, Michelle Linderman, Caroline Brown, Nicole Succar, Anand Sithian, Brian McGrath, Laurel Saito, Rachel Schumacher\n\nBiden Administration Considers Imposing Sanctions on Kaspersky Labs\n\nAs the U.S. government continues to ratchet up sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, public reporting suggests there may be a new target in the sites of U.S. sanctions authorities: Kaspersky Labs (Kaspersky), the popular Russian cybersecurity and antivirus company. Any sanctions imposed by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would come on the heels of other recent government action against Kaspersky. On March 25, 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) added Kaspersky to its list of communications equipment and services that are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, as well as the safety and security of the American people. Kaspersky, which is headquartered in Moscow, is the first non-Chinese company added to the list that includes Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE Corporation, among others. Kaspersky has publicly disagreed with the decision.\n\nFor more, please click here.\n\nFor more information, contact: Caroline Brown, Kate Growley, Robert Holleyman, Jeff Snyder, Evan Wolff, Alexander Urbelis, Christopher Hebdon, Paul Mathis\n\nPresident Joe Biden Outlines 2023 White House Priorities in Budget Request to Congress\n\nJust days following the enactment of the omnibus appropriations law for the remainder of the current fiscal year ending on September 30, President Biden released a $5.7 trillion budget proposal for the 2023 fiscal year. The President is seeking from Congress $1.64 trillion in funding for discretionary programs, a nine percent increase from current funding levels. Of that amount, the proposed budget seeks $813 billion in defense spending and $829 billion for non-defense programs.\n\nIn contrast, almost two-thirds of the proposed budget – $3.65 trillion – is earmarked for mandatory spending including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The White House projects the proposal would result in a $1.3 trillion decline in the federal deficit due in large part to new proposed taxes, including a 15 percent minimum tax on corporate profits and a new minimum tax on households worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe release of the President’s budget is just the first step in a prolonged budget and appropriations process. The President’s budget reflects White House priorities for the upcoming fiscal year and serves as a starting point for Congress as it drafts appropriations measures to keep the government funded. Congress kicked off its appropriations and budget processes for the 2023 fiscal year on Tuesday, March 29. The House Budget Committee hosted White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who defended the President’s budget proposal and argued it will help the economy continue the strongest period of growth in nearly 40 years while paying down the deficit. House and Senate committees are expected to hold numerous hearings with individual department and agency heads in the coming weeks to consider the President’s request and will begin drafting and negotiating various components of the appropriations package following the April Congressional Recess.\n\nCongress is supposed to advance spending measures ahead of the conclusion of the previous fiscal year, though in recent years it has become common practice for Congress to pass short-term funding measures to offer lawmakers more time to negotiate the broader package. In fact, Congress only recently finalized legislation to fund the government for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year weeks ago. It is anticipated that given the upcoming midterm elections and a number of additional competing legislative priorities that Congress could once again rely on continuing resolutions to keep the government funded beyond the end of the current fiscal year on September 30.\n\nFor a non-exhaustive summary highlighting each section of the President’s budget proposal, please click here.\n\nFor more information, contact: James G.

Brown, Mary-Caitlin Ray\n\nEU Competition Authorities Respond to Ukraine Crisis: More Flexibility For State Aid And Cooperation Among Companies\n\nTwo recent initiatives have been adopted by EU competition authorities in response to the current crisis in Ukraine. On March 23, 2022, the European Commission adopted a new Temporary Crisis Framework for State aid measures to support the EU economy following Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The goal is to allow EU countries to support companies and sectors that are severely affected by the economic impact of the war or the sanctions imposed against Russia. The Framework will be in place until December 31, 2022. This initiative comes shortly after the European Competition Network issued a Joint Statement, allowing companies to cooperate to address severe disruptions caused by the Ukraine crisis.\n\nMany businesses in the EU have been directly or indirectly affected by the war, the sanctions imposed and the countermeasures taken. The negative impact may result in loss of turn-over and/or sharp input cost increases, because of shrinking demand, interruption of existing contracts and projects, or disruptions to supply chains. In addition, high energy prices have impacted several economic sectors, including agriculture, food processing and all energy-intensive businesses.\n\nFor more information, please click here.\n\nFor more information, contact: Karel Bourgeois, Flavie Van Maldegem\n\nRussia And Ukraine: The Next Wave of International Disputes\n\nWith the geopolitical and economic crisis in Russia and Ukraine growing rapidly from recent events, international commercial operations in the region will be severely impacted in some manner, and many such impacts will result in disputes. The events surrounding the peso crisis in Argentina in early 2000s, as well as those in Venezuela from the actions of Hugo Chavez, and others arising out of the Arab spring, all resulted in dozens of international disputes. We may see the same from current events, and there will be dispute options available to numerous companies with operations in either country who are experiencing severe disruptions of operations, loss of profit, or destruction of property, including, potentially: investor-State arbitration, domestic litigation, or claims tribunal recovery.\n\nFor more on this important topic, please click here.\n\nFor more information, contact: Ian A.
