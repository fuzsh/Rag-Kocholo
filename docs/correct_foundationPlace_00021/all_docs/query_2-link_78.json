        "text": "As part of its skilling programmes in Odisha, Vedanta Aluminium aims to upgrade the skills of 3,500 youth over the next three years, in partnership with OSDA and NABARD, around its alumina refinery operations in Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district (Odisha).\n\nThe Indian producer of aluminium has announced the expansion of its skill-development initiatives across its locations on the occasion of World Youth Skills Day. These placement-linked programmes are aimed at enhancing the skillsets of rural youth, so that they go from being unskilled to semi-skilled. Vedanta Aluminium has trained almost 14,000 youth through its skill development initiatives and institutional collaborations till date.\n\nThe company has tied up with several coveted training institutions such as the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Odisha Skill Development Authority (OSDA) and Skill Development Institute (SDI) for these programmes.\n\nThe objective is to help youth across India achieve sustainable livelihoods and contribute to the socio-economic development of their communities and the nation. After training, these youth become eligible for higher-paying job opportunities, offering them secure employment and the potential for salary growth over time. Naturally, the success of these trainees inspires others to enrol in the programmes, fostering continuous improvement and much-needed learning culture. The training sessions cover the trades that are in constant demand and meet ongoing industry needs.\n\nJohn Slaven, CEO, Vedanta Aluminium, said,“Skilling the younger population is integral to our vision of elevating the socio-economic status of regions where we operate. By equipping them with market-relevant skills and fostering a culture of continuous learning, we are not only helping them to secure their future but also bringing remote areas of the country to the socio-economic mainstream.”\n\nVedanta’s skill training centres at Lanjigarh and Bhawanipatna offer training courses for roles in food and beverage, hospitality and electrical maintenance, to name a few. Graduates of these programmes have secured placements with prominent organisations such as Club Mahindra, Minerva Group of Hotels and Restaurants, Honda showrooms and Sarovar Hotels and Resorts. In this fiscal year, the programme successfully placed 77 per cent of the trainees.\n\nAt the aluminium plant in Jharsuguda, Odisha, the company has collaborated with Ashok Leyland and the Odisha government for the light motor vehicle and heavy motor vehicle training programme. Many of these trainees are employed at Vedanta’s operations and in nearby industries.\n\nThe company also provides technical training for youth in mechatronics, mechanical and electrical services at the World Skill Centre, Bhubaneswar.\n\nAt its mining operations at Jamkhani in Sundargarh, Odisha, Vedanta Aluminium has partnered with SDI, Bhubaneswar and the State Institute of Hotel Management, Balangir, to train more than 60 candidates across various programmes.\n\nBALCO, a unit of Vedanta has a manufacturing facility in Korba, Chattishgarh, where it is imparting vocational training to rural youth, dropouts, and unemployed population through three centres of Vedanta Skill School. The schools impart skilling in relevant trades like electrical maintenance, welding, hospitality, fitter andsolar technician, and link them with gainful employment opportunities. In FY24, a staggering 81% of trainees secured jobs or pursued entrepreneurship after training.\n\nThe company has collaborated with the Vedanta Foundation to establish a cutting-edge computer lab at Queen Mary Government High School, in Andhra Pradesh, where Vedanta runs the Vizag General Cargo Berth (VGCB) port operations. This lab has empowered over 1,100 young beneficiaries, significantly bridging the digital divide in the area.\n\nIt has also partnered with Centre of Excellence for Maritime & Shipbuilding (CEMS) for the training and placement of 100 youth as computer numerical control(CNC)operators, electricians and inventory controllers,with the inventory controller training batch comprising only female candidates.\n\nKnown for its sustainable practices, Vedanta Aluminium fulfils its mission of spurring emerging applications of aluminium as the ‘Metal of the Future’ for a greener tomorrow."
