        "text": "Summary\n\nOur team conducted an interview with Elena Sivenkova, Head of Marketing Department for KasperskyOS. She told us about Cyber Immune \"Thin Client.\"\n\nKaspersky created a Cyber Immune Thin Client, an endpoint device that does not require additional cybersecurity tools. The product, named ‘Kaspersky Thin Client’, includes an operating system for thin clients based on the microkernel KasperskyOS, which is pre-installed on the hardware platform.\n\nKaspersky's strategy shows a tendency to move from physical to electronic media, and the company is increasingly reducing the production of physical products. Similarly, the main feature of the thin clients is using the cloud instead of local physical devices for storing the data. If more developers adopted this approach, it would contribute to SDG 12. The innovations developed by the company contribute to the creation of a secure information space. In addition, as mentioned above, the innovations can also be used in the field of medicine, industry, retail and energy. All this contributes to the achievement of SDG 9.\n\nInnovation\n\nKaspersky created a Cyber Immune Thin Client as an endpoint device that does not require additional cybersecurity tools. It includes an operating system for thin clients based on the microkernel KasperskyOS, which is pre-installed on the hardware platform.\n\nThin Client is a portable small computer, which costs less than a laptop. Using a thin client, the user gains access to his virtual desktop, which is located on the server. Thus, most computing tasks and information storage are performed in the cloud. An important feature of the Kaspersky Thin Client is that it is secure by design.\n\nAccording to information provided by Elena, Kaspersky Thin Client is one of the future trends to be used in the education area — at universities and schools. The customers will not need to backup the data regularly, because the data is stored in the cloud. Using thin clients, students can only connect to the required services. Thin clients allow to quickly deploy a learning environment for laboratory practice. They also have a relatively long service life, but if the device breaks down you can just buy a new one, which is not so costly as buying a new laptop.\n\nThe main prerequisite for creating such a product is a wish of the company to move from cyber security to Cyber Immunity. It means that the device will not need any antiviruses, if it is based on Kaspersky operating system, because it will be already secured. It is so called “built-in security”.\n\nDue to its Cyber Immune operating system, KasperskyOS guarantees the integrity of data exchanged among users, remote desktops, the centralized management server, and connection and logging broker servers. It also facilitates certificate management and secure updates. The interface of Kaspersky Thin Client provides users and administrators with access to language and network settings, along with desktop display preferences.\n\nKey features of the innovation:\n\n● Quick deployment of thin client (from 2 minutes);\n\n● High update speed thanks to compact OS image size;\n\n● A single console for centralized management of Kaspersky security products;\n\n● Updating via Kaspersky Security Center;\n\n● Manage and monitor thin client infrastructure from anywhere in the corporate network;\n\n● VDI connection, terminal connection, direct connection;\n\n● Connect to remote desktops running Windows and Linux;\n\n● Out-of-the-box device security thanks to KasperskyOS architecture;\n\n● Efficient operation of thin client infrastructures is facilitated through centralized management of settings and operating system image updates on thin clients.\n\nThe innovation can be used in different spheres. For example, in the public sector, education, healthcare, industrial automation, energy, gas and oil, finance services, etc.\n\nInspiration\n\nKaspersky's corporate mission transcends the realm of technology, aspiring to forge a cyber-secure world where every user can confidently navigate the digital landscape enveloped in a shield of safety and protection. The bedrock of this ambitious goal lies in the unified dedication of employees, a collective force that propels the company towards innovative solutions in the cybersecurity domain.\n\nElena Sivenkova, at the helm of the KasperskyOS marketing department, articulates a personal and professional evolution tethered to a profound connection with her colleagues. She emphasizes a preference for collaboration with those who share common ideals, fostering an environment where ideas intertwine seamlessly with purposeful action.\n\nEvgeniy Kaspersky's visionary outlook serves as a guiding beacon for the company's workforce, instilling inspiration that reverberates throughout the organization. This shared vision, a tapestry of collective aspirations, becomes the catalyst for pioneering initiatives in cybersecurity, exemplified by breakthroughs like the Kaspersky Thin Client.\n\nSivenkova amplifies this sentiment, expressing admiration for Evgeniy Kaspersky's ideas and vision.
