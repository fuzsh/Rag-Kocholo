Dozens of staff were convicted after the Fujitsu-supplied system pointed to an array of financial misdemeanors that bewildered the postal workers. Six others had their convictions quashed previously, while another 700 or so workers also are believed to have been prosecuted between 2000 and 2014... Jobs, homes and marriages were lost as a result of wrongful convictions, and some did not live long enough to see their names cleared by Britain's Court of Appeals.\n\nConfirmation that the convictions were quashed was met with cheers and tears. A few bottles of bubbly were also popped.\n\nMartin S. (Slashdot reader #98,249) writes, \"As a software geek, the part I find most troubling is that blind faith that those in authority placed in the software without proper accounting...\" The BBC reports some desperate sub-postmasters even \"attempted to plug the gap with their own money, even remortgaging their homes, in an (often fruitless) attempt to correct an error.\"\n\nThe judge in the case complains that for years the Post Office had \"consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable\" and \"effectively steamrolled over any subpostmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy,\" according to an article in The Scotsman: Nick Read, Post Office chief executive said: \"I am in no doubt about the human cost of the Post Office's past failures and the deep pain that has been caused to people affected. Many of those postmasters involved have been fighting for justice for a considerable length of time and sadly there are some who are not here to see the outcome today and whose families have taken forward appeals in their memory. I am very moved by their courage.\"\n\nThere were 73 convictions in Scotland caused by the failure. Although a total of 47 postmasters in England and Wales have had their cases referred to the Appeal Court, there has never been similar action in Scotland.\n\nHowever, now the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has written to the people it believes may also have been the victims of possible miscarriages of justice in Scotland relating to the Horizon computer system."
