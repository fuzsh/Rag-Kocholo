And in fulfilling that mission we aim to become the global leader in cybersecurity – by securing technology to make sure that the possibilities it brings become opportunities for each and every one of us. Bring on endless possibilities. Bring on a safer tomorrow.” - Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky\n\nWe are a global company, with a global vision and a focus on international markets. We operate in 200 countries and territories and have 34 offices in more than 30 countries. Our team consists of more than 4,000 highly-qualified specialists.\n\nOur mission is to build a safer world. We believe in a tomorrow where technology improves all of our lives.\n\nWhich is why we secure it, so everyone everywhere has the endless opportunities it brings. In the modern world, cybersecurity is about more than just protecting devices, but developing an ecosystem where everything connected through technology is immune to cyber threats. That’s why we have moved beyond the anti-virus laboratory to provide cybersecurity technology that people can trust, and our business focus has evolved towards the wider concept of “cyber-immunity”.\n\nWe are forever innovating, delivering protection that’s effective, usable and accessible. We pride ourselves on developing world-leading security that keeps us – and every one of our 400 million users protected by our technologies, and 220,000 corporate clients – one step ahead of potential threats.\n\nOur unique experience and knowledge\n\nAs the world has become more digitized and globalized, we at Kaspersky have become a technology leader with an advanced and comprehensive portfolio of security solutions and services. Now our business focus is continuing to evolve from “cybersecurity” towards the wider concept of “cyber-immunity”.\n\nA safer world without borders\n\nCollaboration is the most effective way of building a safer world and fighting cybercriminals. We share our expertise, knowledge and technical findings with the world’s security community. We are proud to collaborate with global IT security vendors, international organizations, and national and regional law enforcement agencies all over the world in fighting cybercrime.\n\nKaspersky’s solutions and services\n\nThe cornerstone of our business strategy is to transform our leading security intelligence into real protection for our clients, to enable them to use technologies in their lives and businesses safely and trust them. Our goal is to bring on the future for our customers.\n\nGlobal Brand Initiatives\n\nWe contribute to the development of science and modern art, help preserve the world and provide the opportunity for sportspeople to achieve their full potential.\n\nSupporting art, science and sports\n\nWe are always delighted to work with companies that are as passionate about what they do as we are. We also participate in various racing series and support talented drivers, including Giancarlo Fisichella, Antonio Giovinazzi and Amna Al Qubaisi – the first Arab woman to compete in Formula 4.\n\nWe also support key sporting events which celebrate strategic and forward thinking. Kaspersky is an official cybersecurity partner of the FIDE World Championship series – the world's most prestigious chess tournament. The company also supports young chess players from Russia including Andrey Tsvetkov, Mikhail Antipov and Victoria Loskutova. We sponsor the Kaspersky Riga Masters tournament, a professional snooker ranking event. Snooker requires a sharp mind and a high level of strategic thinking. These traits are essential to Kaspersky too. Our mission to build a safer world depends upon the dedication, creativity and skills of our experts all around the globe.\n\nWe understand the importance of preserving past cultures, for the benefit of future generations. That is why Kaspersky has been cooperating with the Archeological Society at Athens (ASA) since 2015, to develop its Akrotiri project. This project is saving the remains of the historic Cycladic/Minoan settlement on Santorini Island, known as “the Greek Pompeii”. Kaspersky has become the major sponsor of the project, providing support for a number of activities to help the scientists further their work. This includes the restoration of the excavations, the conservation of spectacular wall paintings and the project’s building conservation work.\n\nKaspersky is also supporting Starmus, renowned as the world's most ambitious science and music festival. Starmus was founded to celebrate science and the arts with the goal of bringing an understanding and appreciation of science to the general public. It gathers highly reputable speakers, including international scientists, cosmonauts and astronauts, artists and musicians, writers, business leaders, and more.\n\nMoreover, Kaspersky became a partner of the Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center – the facility in Star City where cosmonauts from all over the world prepare to go to space. As part of this collaboration, in September 2019, our experts from the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) held a special training for cosmonauts, as well as IT specialists at the center, to educate them on the current cybersecurity landscape.\n\nKaspersky is interested in initiatives that combine human excellence, art and IT. That is why we are proud to support a number of different cultural endeavors and sporting events, including sponsorship of the first Antarctic Biennale in 2017 that involved a hundred people from all over the world, including artists, architects, researchers, and philosophers. In 2018 Kaspersky was a general sponsor for the first ever all-woman Euro-Arabian North Pole expedition – an eight day polar adventure to foster greater dialogue and understanding between women from Western and Arabian cultures. Since 2014 we have partnered with Moniker International Art Fair in London, supporting special commissions from internationally-acclaimed artists, such as Ben Eine. In 2018, Kaspersky boosted a significant creative collaboration with British multimedia street artist D*Face through the ‘Save the World’ theme. As a part of the continuous commitment to the field of contemporary art, Kaspersky partnered with the British street artist SHOK-1, famous for his X-ray paintings. Together we presented an X-ray artwork - of Kaspersky’s mascot Midori Kuma that expresses both the artist’s and Kaspersky’s shared value of transparency and its importance in today’s world."
