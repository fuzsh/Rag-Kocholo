        "text": "Careers at Kaspersky Lab\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of Kaspersky Lab is to provide the world’s most effective, responsive and efficient protection against cyber threats: those from malware, spam, hackers, DDoS attacks, sophisticated cyber espionage tools, and cyber weapons that target countries’ critical infrastructure with potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\nBusiness Segments\n\nKaspersky Lab incorporates two business segments:\n\nSecurity for Home - Includes PC, Mac and Android users concerned about protection of their information from viruses and safe web browsing.\n\nSecurity for Business - Provides adequate cyber protection to businesses, enterprises and corporations with the help of business anti-malware solutions and protection of data reserves.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was through an accident that Eugene Kaspersky was introduced to cybersecurity. In 1989, his computer became infected with the ‘Cascade’ virus. Eugene, with the help of his specialized education in cryptography, studied the encrypted virus, comprehended its behavior, and created a tool for its removal. This encounter with computer technology, of successfully removing the virus, increased his passion and curiosity for the field and pushed him to delve more into analysis of malicious programs and development of disinfection modules for them. His entire collection including disinfection tools and antivirus modules eventually went on to become the foundation for Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus database, making it one of the most thorough and extensive collections in cybersecurity, protecting systems from more than 100 million malicious programs.\n\nEugene began to put together a team of passionate and enthusiastic researchers in 1990 to produce the AVP Toolkit Pro antivirus program. This program later went on to gain immense acclaim and recognition and was recognized as the most effective antivirus software in the world by the University of Hamburg in 1994.\n\nFollowing this success, Eugene and his colleagues then decided to found their own independent company. As a result, in 1997 Kaspersky Lab was established. In 2007, Eugene was named Kaspersky Lab’s CEO.\n\nToday, Kaspersky Lab is the world’s largest privately-held vendor of endpoint protection, active in almost 200 countries and global territories. The company boasts more than 3,000 professionals and IT security specialists in dedicated regional offices across 30 countries and its cybersecurity technologies protect over 400 million users worldwide.\n\nBenefits at Kaspersky Lab"
