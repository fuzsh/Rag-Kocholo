Settling into our new space in this strategic location will meet our business needs for accessibility and more. Harbourfront will cater all these needs,\" says Stephan Neumeier, Managing Director of Kaspersky Lab Asia Pacific.\n\nCommenting on the opening of the relocated office, Eugene Kaspersky, chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said: “There is so much positive energy about this move. We’re glad to be staying in Singapore which has been our home in the region since we reallocated from Hong Kong two years ago. Moving to a bigger office after just two years is soon but we’re ushering in a new chapter for the APAC team. Being in the fastest growing region in the global economy, we’re determined to explore the APAC market’s full potential and we’re ready to move ahead with greater achievements.”"
