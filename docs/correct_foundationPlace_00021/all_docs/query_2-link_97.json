        "text": "Anyone who frequents this blog, owns a Kaspersky Lab product, or has seen one of our advertisements knows our company’s mission is to save the world. This may sound clichéd, but you can’t save the world if you don’t look to make your local community a better place.\n\nEach year, employees of Kaspersky Lab’s offices around the globe take time from their workdays and invest in helping out nonprofit organizations within their local communities. For Kaspersky Lab North America, this means heading into the greater Boston community (and some company events) and helping out their neighbors. In the first half of 2018, the team has looked to make an impact with more than 11 organizations since January. Below is a roundup of the events that the team has participated in during 2018:\n\nLittle Brothers Friends of the Elderly, Jewish Community Housing for the Elderly, and Ethos\n\nTwo dozen employees gathered to create more than 150 handmade greeting cards for isolated elderly people in need. The recipients received the cards on their birthdays and Valentine’s Day.\n\nAmerican Cancer Society\n\nAt the company’s annual kick-off, raffle tickets were purchased with all proceeds going to a charity of the winner’s choice. As a result, the American Cancer Society was named the beneficiary of a $1,000 donation.\n\nStoneham Public Library\n\nKaspersky Lab North America hosted a reading circle at the Stoneham Public Library for a group of local children and their families. The company’s mascot, Midori Kuma, was in attendance and children received copies of a Kaspersky Lab children’s book on how to stay safe online.\n\nMore Than Words\n\nDuring an in-office book drive, employees donated more than 100 books to More Than Words, a nonprofit organization that empowers underprivileged youth to operate a business by running a used book shop.\n\nThe Windham Windup — Team 3467 (Windham High School, Windham, New Hampshire)\n\nFor the third year in a row, the company sponsored the Windham Windup (Team 3467) in the FIRST Robotics Competition, a high school robotics competition for students ages 14–18.\n\nRosie’s Place\n\nMore than a dozen employees served lunches for 101 women and children at Rosie’s Place, which serves more than 100,000 meals to underprivileged families each year.\n\nEspirito Santo Parochial School\n\nMidori Kuma and friends visited the Espirito Santo Parochial School, a K–8 school in Fall River, Massachusetts, where close to 80 children and staff were educated on cybersecurity best practices.\n\nMSPCA\n\nFollowing a companywide blind auction for Boston Celtics playoff tickets, the $1,500 winning bid was donated to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (MSPCA).\n\nChild Crisis Arizona\n\nDuring the company’s annual NA Partner Conference, Kaspersky Lab North America employees and their guests, through Child Crisis Arizona, stuffed more than 100 backpacks with school supplies for children in need.\n\nAmerican Legion/Lindenwood Cemetery\n\nMore than a dozen employees honored our nation’s veterans by placing US flags on the graves of these brave heroes before Memorial Day.\n\nBoston Children’s Hospital\n\nA team of 20 employees participated in the Boston Children’s Hospital Corporate Cup, competing in fun obstacles and sports games against local companies for a great cause."
