        "text": "Kaspersky Lab has announced the opening of a new location in Singapore for its regional HQ to support the expansion of its business in Asia-Pacific. The aim is to better serve the requirements of its growing numbers of partners and customers across the region.\n\nAs the company was attracted to the city-state because of its technology-pervasive atmosphere, and the strength of, and government support for the cybersecurity industry, it chose the location for its regional headquarters.\n\nAccording to the company, not only serving as a hub for administrative, sales, marketing, and channel departments, the new Singapore office will also represent the regional base of the company’s research and development team headed by Vitaly Kamluk, Director of the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) at Kaspersky Lab APAC. The new address, at the Harbourfront Tower One, will provide more office space for the growing global cybersecurity company as well as closer proximity to the partners it collaborates with frequently.\n\n“The move to our current location will allow us to grow and will deliver greater efficiencies. It will enable us to deliver key results to the company. Settling into our new space in this strategic location will meet our business needs for accessibility and more.Harbourfront will cater all these needs,\" says Stephan Neumeier, Managing Director of Kaspersky Lab Asia-Pacific.\n\nCommenting on the opening of the relocated office, Eugene Kaspersky, Chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said, “There is so much positive energy about this move. We’re glad to be staying in Singapore which has been our home in the region since we reallocated from Hong Kong two years ago. Moving to a bigger office after just two years is soon but we’re ushering in a new chapter for the APAC team. Being in the fastest-growing region in the global economy, we’re determined to explore the APAC market’s full potential and we’re ready to move ahead with greater achievements.”"
