        "text": "“Our mission is simple – building a safer world. And in fulfilling that mission we aim to become the global leader in cybersecurity – by securing technology to make sure that the possibilities it brings become opportunities for each and every one of us. Bring on endless possibilities. Bring on a safer tomorrow.” - Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky\n\nWe are a global company, with a global vision and a focus on international markets. We operate in 200 countries and territories and have 34 offices in more than 30 countries. Our team consists of more than 4,000 highly-qualified specialists. Our mission is to build a safer world. We believe in a tomorrow where technology improves all of our lives.\n\nWhich is why we secure it, so everyone everywhere has the endless opportunities it brings. In the modern world, cybersecurity is about more than just protecting devices, but developing an ecosystem where everything connected through technology is protected. That’s why we have moved beyond the anti-virus laboratory to provide cybersecurity technology that people can trust, and our business focus has evolved towards the wider concept of “cyber-immunity”.\n\nWe are forever innovating, delivering protection that’s effective, usable and accessible. We pride ourselves on developing world-leading security that keeps us – and every one of our 400 million users protected by our technologies, and 220,000 corporate clients – one step ahead of potential threats.\n\nOur unique experience and knowledge\n\nThe rapid proliferation of new technologies provides people with new opportunities. However, the resultant, growing dependence on IT makes cybersecurity not just the responsibility of IT-specialists, but also one of the main concerns for business leaders across all industries.\n\nA safer world without borders\n\nCollaboration is the most effective way of building a safer world and fighting cybercriminals. We believe there are no borders to providing security. To this end, we share our expertise, knowledge and technical findings with the world’s security community.\n\nKaspersky’s solutions and services\n\nThe cornerstone of our business strategy is to transform our leading security intelligence into real protection for our clients, to enable them to use technologies in their lives and businesses safely and trust them. Our goal is to bring on the future for our customers.\n\nGlobal Transparency Initiative\n\nKaspersky is committed to protecting customers from cyberthreats, regardless of their origin or purpose. The company’s Global Transparency Initiative (GTI) is aimed at engaging the broader information security community and other stakeholders in validating and verifying the trustworthiness of our products, internal processes, and business operations. It also introduces additional accountability mechanisms by which the company can further demonstrate that it addresses any security issues promptly and thoroughly.\n\nKaspersky’s Global Transparency Initiative includes a number of actionable and concrete measures:\n\nIndependent review of the company’s source code, software updates and threat detection rules;\n\nIndependent review of the company’s secure development lifecycle processes, and its software and supply chain risk mitigation strategies;\n\nTransparency Centers across the globe to address any security concerns, together with customers, trusted partners and government stakeholders. The first center was opened in Zurich, Switzerland in November 2018 and serves as a facility for such partners to access company code reviews, software updates, and threat detection rules, along with other activities. In June 2019 Kaspersky also opened a Transparency Center in Madrid, and the third Transparency Center in Malaysia will be open by 2020;\n\nIncreased bug bounty rewards up to $100,000 for the most severe vulnerabilities found under Kaspersky’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program. Also, we support the Disclose.io framework which provides Safe Harbor for vulnerability researchers concerned about negative legal consequences of their discoveries.\n\nWithin the framework of our initiative, we are also relocating the data storage and processing of user data from some regions shared voluntarily with the Kaspersky Security Network, as well as our software development infrastructure, to Switzerland. In November 2018 we began processing malicious and suspicious files shared by European customers.\n\nIn addition, in July 2019 we successfully completed the Service Organization Control for Service Organizations (SOC 2) Type 1 audit undertaken by one of the Big Four accounting professional services firms, which confirms that the development and release of our antivirus databases are protected from unauthorized changes by strong security controls.\n\nCSR and Global Brand Initiatives\n\nOur ultimate mission – to build a safer world – shows the company’s commitment to making our world a better place, where everyone everywhere has endless opportunities and we protect what matters most to people.\n\nThis vision also unites the company’s business goals and approach to corporate social responsibility.\n\nSupporting art, science and sports\n\nWe are always delighted to work with companies that are as passionate about what they do as we are. We also participate in various racing series and support talented drivers, including Giancarlo Fisichella, Antonio Giovinazzi and Amna Al Qubaisi – the first Arab woman to compete in Formula 4.\n\nWe also support key sporting events which celebrate strategic and forward thinking. Kaspersky is an official cybersecurity partner of the FIDE World Championship series – the world's most prestigious chess tournament. The company also supports young chess players from Russia including Andrey Tsvetkov, Mikhail Antipov and Victoria Loskutova. We sponsor the Kaspersky Riga Masters tournament, a professional snooker ranking event. Snooker requires a sharp mind and a high level of strategic thinking. These traits are essential to Kaspersky too. Our mission to build a safer world depends upon the dedication, creativity and skills of our experts all around the globe.\n\nWe understand the importance of preserving past cultures, for the benefit of future generations. That is why Kaspersky has been cooperating with the Archeological Society at Athens (ASA) since 2015, to develop its Akrotiri project. This project is saving the remains of the historic Cycladic/Minoan settlement on Santorini Island, known as “the Greek Pompeii”. Kaspersky has become the major sponsor of the project, providing support for a number of activities to help the scientists further their work. This includes the restoration of the excavations, the conservation of spectacular wall paintings and the project’s building conservation work.\n\nKaspersky is also supporting Starmus, renowned as the world's most ambitious science and music festival. Starmus was founded to celebrate science and the arts with the goal of bringing an understanding and appreciation of science to the general public. It gathers highly reputable speakers, including international scientists, cosmonauts and astronauts, artists and musicians, writers, business leaders, and more.\n\nMoreover, Kaspersky has become a partner of the Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center – the facility in Star City where cosmonauts from all over the world prepare to go to space. As part of this collaboration, in September 2019, our experts from the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) will hold special training for cosmonauts, as well as IT specialists at the center, to educate them on the current cybersecurity landscape.\n\nKaspersky is interested in initiatives that combine human excellence, art and IT. That is why we are proud to support a number of different cultural endeavors and sporting events, including sponsorship of the first Antarctic Biennale in 2017 that involved a hundred people from all over the world, including artists, architects, researchers, and philosophers. In 2018 Kaspersky was a general sponsor for the first ever all-woman Euro-Arabian North Pole expedition – an eight day polar adventure to foster greater dialogue and understanding between women from Western and Arabian cultures. Since 2014 we have partnered with Moniker International Art Fair in London, supporting special commissions from internationally-acclaimed artists, such as Ben Eine. In 2018, Kaspersky boosted a significant creative collaboration with British multimedia street artist D*Face through the ‘Save the World’ theme.\n\nOur educational initiatives\n\nWe believe that encouraging dialog and launching educational programs are essential steps towards international collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. That is why we operate the Kaspersky Academy – an international educational project established by Kaspersky in 2010. We promote cybersecurity knowledge worldwide by supporting young talent in IT and contributing to the development of high-quality cybersecurity educational programs.\n\nKaspersky also runs the Secur’IT Cup – a global competition open to students from all over the world and from any academic background. Participants have the chance to win $10,000, as well as benefit from competing alongside like-minded students and building an understanding of what it is like to work in the industry. They are welcome to suggest their own project ideas that help to solve global cybersecurity issues.\n\nAs for school education, we distribute globally the children’s book “Kasper, Sky and the Green Bear” – a joint publication by Kaspersky and Dutch writer Marlies Slegers. It is intended to educate young users on being safe online. We implement an educational project, Kaspersky School, based in Moscow, Russia, aimed at giving schoolchildren fundamental mathematical knowledge that will allow them to choose what they will study in the future. The project is also intended to educate schoolchildren and teachers on cybersecurity basics.\n\nWe believe cybersecurity is one of the main concerns for leaders of numerous businesses of all different sizes and across all industries. At the C-suite level, companies must understand cybersecurity issues and become more engaged in threat management. That’s why Kaspersky collaborates with business schools, such as INSEAD, one of the of the top three schools for Executive Education and leading MBA programs in the world and introduces students to the cybersecurity field through keynote lectures.\n\nOur social projects\n\nAs we create a safer future, we are not only concerned about the well-being of the world in a digital capacity. Gender equality, accessible knowledge, volunteering, paying attention to children, animal protection and other similar issues are really important for us. Kaspersky creates many social projects aimed at changing the everyday lives of people for the better.\n\nKaspersky created an online community, Women in Cybersecurity, that helps supercharge the career growth of women entering the cybersecurity industry and those already working in the field. We’ve also launched initiatives such as the Women’s Network in London, UK, with a goal to further building bridges between our community of women and men at all levels of the company through networking, mentoring, and knowledge sharing – helping to create a working environment where every woman can reach her full potential. In Boston, USA, the company hosts industry events such as CyberStarts – an event aimed to empower the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. CyberStarts features discussions addressing the industry's skills shortage, unconventional career paths, leadership in the workplace, as well as actions to reduce the gender gap in cybersecurity. Speakers at this event are usually outstanding women from the technology business and the cybersecurity industry.\n\nKaspersky has been at the forefront of protecting victims of stalkerware – a type of a commercial spyware deemed to be legal, but which may lead to domestic abuse as it can be used to secretly monitor and track a partner’s device activity. The company is the first in the industry to have updated its product, so users of Kaspersky Internet Security for Android receive a Privacy Alert – a new feature that warns the user if their private information is being covertly monitored by a third party. Furthermore, the company cooperates with Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nIn July 2019, Kaspersky sponsored a 12-day expedition to the Kuril Islands with a renowned team of environmentalists, film makers and photographers, aimed at giving people the opportunity to explore the remarkable nature of the islands and bring attention to the current ecological situation faced by the region. The expedition was also supported by WWF Russia, helping the team understand the current environmental challenges in the area.\n\nOur charity initiatives\n\nKaspersky is committed to social responsibility through volunteering and philanthropy in the different regions where the company operates. We cooperate with non-profit organizations, support charity initiatives and create our own ones.\n\nWe support charitable foundations worldwide that fight for people's wellbeing. For instance, Kaspersky sponsors a New Year's Eve charity auction that supports children with cancer, held by the fund Gift of Life in London, UK. Amongst others, the company cooperates with the Vera Hospice Charity Fund – the only non-profit organization in Russia that systematically supports patients of hospices throughout the country. Moreover, the company hosts Blood Donor days regularly.\n\nKaspersky works with children's funds and supports orphanages and hospitals. Its regional offices are involved in various local initiatives. For instance, in 2018, 100 backpacks filled with school supplies were donated to Child Crisis Arizona. In addition, the company has recently partnered with the non-profit organization Gulf for Good based in Dubai, UAE that helps children around the world through education, healthcare and housing. Kaspersky also donated necessity supplies to the Rumah Bakti Nur Syaheera orphanage in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nIn addition, the company’s staff collects and delivers items for the elderly and people with disabilities on a regular basis. As for local initiatives, the team in our regional office in the USA sorted food at the Greater Boston Food Bank as part of the company’s Month of Giving, and donated meals to the critically ill in need through the company’s Pie in the Sky initiative via Community Servings. In Australia, the company sponsored the Dandelion Support Network – a group of volunteers providing families with essential nursery items.\n\nWe also participate in sports charity events. Kaspersky employees across the globe support people with special needs by getting involved with fun activities, like playing football and volleyball, riding bicycles and dancing. For instance, staff members from the Moscow office participate in the Running Hearts event to raise funds for charity.\n\nKaspersky loves animals. In 2018, the company sponsored the Woofstock festival and raised $45,000 for the Buddy Dog Humane Society – an organization maintaining a shelter for homeless cats and dogs. Additionally, American Kaspersky staff members donated money to The Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nWe are incredibly proud to support a wide range of worldwide initiatives. Our team members are not only committed to helping the world become a safer place online, they are also dedicated to showing how Kaspersky can be a force for good beyond the cybersecurity landscape. We continue to proactively help people and donate both time and funds to improve their lives for the better."
