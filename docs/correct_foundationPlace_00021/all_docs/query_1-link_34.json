        "text": "Friday, December 15, 2017\n\nSignificance\n\nKaspersky is a top global cybersecurity firm based in Russia. US Senators and the Department of Homeland Security have accused Kaspersky of having links with Russian officials and allowing Moscow to use its software to spy on US politicians.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe allegations of links to Russian intelligence could force Kaspersky to retrench its operations.\n\nThey are likely to especially hurt the company in the US market.\n\nThe Kaspersky case will also make it harder for small start-ups unconnected to state institutions to enter the global market.\n\nRelated articles"
