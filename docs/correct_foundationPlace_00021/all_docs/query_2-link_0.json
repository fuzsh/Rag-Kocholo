        "text": "Founded in 2004, Kaspersky North America is a Massachusetts corporation and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its holding company, Kaspersky Labs Limited, based in the United Kingdom.\n\nWe are one of the world’s largest privately owned cybersecurity companies [i]. We operate in 200 countries and territories and have 35 offices in 31 countries. Over 4,000 highly-qualified specialists work for Kaspersky.\n\nWe are a global company, with a global vision and a focus on international markets. Our global unaudited IFRS revenue for 2017 totaled USD 698 million.\n\nOur independence allows us to be more agile; to think differently and act faster. We are forever innovating, delivering protection that’s effective, usable and accessible. We pride ourselves on developing world-leading security that keeps us – and every one of our 400 million users protected by our technologies, and 220,000 corporate clients – one step ahead of potential threats.\n\nOur commitment to people, as well as advanced technology, also keeps us ahead of the competition. Our company has been named a Leader in endpoint protection by analyst firm Forrester [ii]. Firmly positioned as one of the top four leading endpoint security vendors, we continue to improve our market position. Kaspersky has been recognized for its customer satisfaction ratings, being named a Gartner Peer Insights Customers’ Choice for Endpoint Protection Platforms in 2017 and 2018 [iii].\n\nEndpoint security has always been the core of our business, especially in the small-to-medium-sized business segment. At the same time, over the next few years, we expect one of our main growth drivers to be in the enterprise market, particularly in the non-endpoint security area. Our customers’ needs change in line with the evolution of the threat landscape. Therefore, we are constantly expanding our enterprise portfolio with security solutions and services strengthened by Kaspersky’s global cybersecurity intelligence.\n\nKaspersky Corporate Profile\n\nOur unique experience and knowledge\n\nThe rapid proliferation of new technologies provides people with new opportunities. However, the resultant, growing dependence on IT makes cyberthreats a global problem. Since the IT industry has become so important to the world, expertise in IT security has become doubly so. We at Kaspersky Lab understand the global cyberthreat landscape and our experts possess immense knowledge and experience in detecting and neutralizing all forms of malicious programs, regardless of their origin or purpose. The wealth of expertise we have gained over years of combating major IT threats is our most valuable asset.\n\nSecurity without borders\n\nCollaboration is the most effective way of fighting cybercriminals. We believe there are no borders to providing security. To this end, we share our expertise, knowledge and technical findings with the world’s security community.\n\nWe are proud to collaborate with global IT security vendors, international organizations, and national and regional law enforcement agencies all over the world in fighting cybercrime.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s solutions and services\n\nThe cornerstone of our business strategy is to transform our leading security intelligence into real protection for our clients, to address current and emerging cyberthreats.\n\nOur portfolio encompasses solutions to suit a wide range of customers. We protect consumers, small companies, medium-sized businesses and enterprises from different types of threats and provide them with convenient tools to control and manage their security.\n\nGlobal Transparency Initiative\n\nKaspersky Lab is committed to protecting customers from cyberthreats, regardless of their origin or purpose. The company’s Global Transparency Initiative (GTI) is aimed at engaging the broader information security community and other stakeholders in validating and verifying the trustworthiness of its products, internal processes, and business operations. It also introduces additional accountability mechanisms by which the company can further demonstrate that it addresses any security issues promptly and thoroughly.\n\nKaspersky Lab’s Global Transparency Initiative includes a number of actionable and concrete measures:\n\nIndependent review of the company’s source code, software updates and threat detection rules;\n\nIndependent review of the company’s secure development lifecycle processes, and its software and supply chain risk mitigation strategies;\n\nThree Transparency centers globally to address any security concerns, together with customers, trusted partners and government stakeholders. The first center was opened in Zurich, Switzerland in November 2018 and serves as a facility for such partners to access company code reviews, software updates, and threat detection rules, along with other activities. Other Transparency Centers will open in Asia and North America by 2020;\n\nIncreased bug bounty rewards up to $100k for the most severe vulnerabilities found under Kaspersky Lab’s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure program.\n\nWithin the framework of our initiative, we are also relocating the data storage and processing of user data from some regions shared voluntarily with the Kaspersky Security Network, as well as our software development infrastructure, to Switzerland. In November 2018 we began data processing for European customers.\n\nCSR and Global Brand Initiatives\n\nOur ultimate mission - to save the world - shows the company’s commitment to making cyberspace safer and to protect what matters most to people. This vision unites the company’s business goals and approach to corporate social responsibility.\n\nSupporting art, science and sports\n\nWe are always delighted to work with companies that are as passionate about what they do as we are. We understand the importance of preserving past cultures, for the benefit of future generations. That is why Kaspersky Lab has been cooperating with the Archeological Society at Athens (ASA) since 2015, to develop its Akrotiri project. This project is saving the remains of the historic Cycladic/Minoan settlement on Santorini Island, known as the Greek “Pompeii”. The company has become the major sponsor of the project, providing support for a number of activities to help the scientists further their work. This includes the restoration of the excavations, the conservation of spectacular wall paintings and the project’s building conservation work.\n\nKaspersky Lab is interested in initiatives that combine human excellence, art and IT. That is why we are proud to support a number of different cultural endeavors and sporting events. Kaspersky Lab is a general sponsor for the first ever all-woman Euro-Arabian North Pole expedition. This is an eight day polar adventure to foster greater dialogue and understanding between women from Western and Arabian cultures. In 2017, Kaspersky Lab was a general sponsor of the 1st Antarctic Biennale, a creative journey that involves a hundred people from all over the world - artists, architects, researchers, and philosophers - who will explore and create a universal cultural future for Antarctica. We are also supporting Starmus, renowned to be the world's most ambitious science and music festival. Starmus was founded to celebrate science and the arts with the goal of bringing an understanding and appreciation of science to the general public. It gathers the most reputable speakers – international scientists, cosmonauts and astronauts, artists and musicians, writers, business leaders, and more.\n\nWe also support key sporting events which celebrate strategic and forward-thinking. Kaspersky Lab supports and protects FIDE and the World Chess Championship 2017-18, as official cybersecurity partner. Since 2016, we have also sponsored chess Grandmaster and World Vice Champion Sergey Karjakin; and since 2012, we have supported a young candidate master Andrey Tsvetkov, as well as Grandmaster and world junior chess champion Mikhail Antipov.\n\nOur educational initiatives\n\nWe believe that encouraging dialog and launching educational programs are essential steps towards international collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. That is why we operate the Kaspersky Academy: a series of projects dedicated to supporting young talent in IT security.\n\nKLNA CSR Report 2019\n\n[i]The company was rated fourth in the IDC ‘Worldwide Endpoint Security Market Shares, 2015: Currency Volatility Headwind Vendors’ report (IDC # US41867116, 2015 - Nov 2016)\n\n[ii]The Forrester Wave™: Endpoint Security Suites, Q4 2016"
