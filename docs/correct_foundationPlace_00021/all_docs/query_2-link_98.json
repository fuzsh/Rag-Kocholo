        "text": "Kaspersky Lab today announces that it has added Singapore to its ever-expanding worldwide network of offices. The new office is the 34th representative division of the company. Kaspersky Lab offices are now located in 31 countries on five continents.\n\nThe new office in Singapore is to oversee national business development, while also becoming the future focal point for the company’s R&D in the region. Eventually it will also become the regional HQ, acting as a business hub for the wider Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe Singapore location was not chosen by chance – it was a strategic decision of the management of the company based on the city-state’s being the ‘place to be’ in APAC – a region that holds great potential in terms of business opportunities, especially in the corporate and governmental sectors.\n\nSingapore is also the location of INTERPOL’s newly opened Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI), with which Kaspersky Lab is working closely. The company is to provide the world’s largest international police organization with its top-level threat intelligence, update it on the global malware landscape on a regular basis, assist in investigations of cyber-incidents, and train officers. One of our top security researchers has moved to Singapore to support the launch of the IGCI’s Digital Forensics Laboratory and to provide high-level advice on site. He’ll be joined soon by colleagues – other top Kaspersky Lab security experts – to make up a full team of researchers located in Singapore.\n\nCommenting on the office opening, Eugene Kaspersky, chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said: “Singapore is one of the most technologically developed countries in the world, while at the same time one of the main financial hubs on the planet. A strong presence here is simply essential for a successful international company. What’s also important is that the Singapore government fully understands the importance of cybersecurity and creates perfect conditions for a business like ours. As Singapore progresses with its plan to become one of the world’s Smart Nations, we’re ideally placed to support and help the city-state grow and prosper. We’re very excited about the opportunity to be ahead in both thought and technology in the APAC region.”\n\nConcurrent with the new office opening Kaspersky Lab has already begun cooperation with the Singapore Economic Development Board in welcoming Singaporean students to pass a traineeship at the global headquarters of the company."
