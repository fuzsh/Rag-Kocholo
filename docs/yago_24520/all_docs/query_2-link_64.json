        "text": "Joe Phillips â¦. . DEAR ME .. . â¦ 19 August 2024\n\nIt isn't exciting anymore.\n\nSome people worry more than others.\n\nMy cousin Waymond grew up across the highway from Taylor's Ridge but never walked the curving paved road to the top.\n\nA few miles south the popular Pinhoti Trail accommodates hikers of various abilities.\n\nI walked far enough down the trail to know I wasn't prepared for it and went back to the truck.\n\nI suggested to Waymond that we take a walk down the Pinhoti. He responded that it would be âdare someâ and âsomething might happen.â\n\nHe came by his cautious nature honestly.\n\nThere are many reasons why seniors draw back from the edge.\n\nThe first is that by the time we hit senior status, we've seen a lot of things happen.\n\nWhile walking to the mail box I thought about how much fun it was to be a kid.\n\nI think more seniors should be jumping off the high diving board. They are in the deep end and as long as you land sort of perpendicular it doesn't hurt much.\n\nThe worst part was the climb to the top and the view from up there. Take your pick on which was worse but maybe there could be a middle board for seniors.\n\nPlaying Tag involved trying to run a slower kid down so you could tag them to take your place. A slow-motion game of tag could work.\n\nMagnolia trees are easily climbed. Limbs sprout on opposite sides of the trunk sort of like steps.\n\nI think senior centers should have more climbing trees.\n\nI've heard that you never forget how to ride a bike and if true why don't seniors ride bikes?\n\nThere are paved trails on old railroad beds that are miles long. I've heard of people riding bikes all the way to Alabama. Some do it on skates.\n\nIf the two-wheeler is too much there is always the trike for adults, bringing to mind that we start on a trike and circle back to one.\n\nI think seniors would benefit from more time playing in the dirt. Gardening would be good but so would a fast or slow game of marbles. There is a variety store still selling sells marbles by the bag.\n\nA game could have some therapeutic value in stretching and flexing trying to get up\n\noff the ground.\n\nThere used to be a game called âTwister.â It was a lot of fun and maybe I should re-visit that but there is that getting up from the floor thing again.\n\nThere is usually enough wind to fly a kite and the game of âCorn Holeâ shouldn't require you to toss bags of corn. The game would last longer if you tossed in the corn a kernel at a time.\n\nAs a boy, I used to swim in lakes and go hand fishing in creeks. I've seen enough television to leave those alone now.\n\nBeing a Senior doesn't have to mean you sit still. Move. Move something.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nFor eons, it was impossible to know what time it was. Rather than being tied to a clock they were tied to crowing roosters and cows bellowing for someone to relieve them of milk.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used solar clocks to determine the hour but it would be a long time before those hours were divided into minutes and seconds. Knowing the hour was close enough.\n\nIn the 1800's some men carried a pocket watch that was wound by a key. We have one of those in the Douglas County Museum of History and Art.\n\nMobile phones grab the correct time from somewhere and display it. Fewer people wear or carry a watch.\n\nThe watch I wear provides more information than I need. It was on sale at the big box wholesale store and I just could not resist it at the price. It has worked faultlessly.\n\nA tiny receiver sets the watch sometime after midnight on a signal from Boulder, CO.\n\nI could buy a digital watch for a dollar but this watch does so many things. It includes a stopwatch as well as a count-down timer and a compass. I don't trust the thermometer and don't know how to use the altimeter function.\n\nMy great-grandfather didn't own a clock or even a âdollar watch.â Noon was when the sun was straight up. Otherwise, it was before or after noon.\n\nPhones and GPS receivers contain maps and display your location from the satellite which has very sensitive clocks on board.\n\nMy father loved striking clocks and owned several. In this house, we have different ideas on the desirability of striking clocks. After a while, you don't hear them all going off at once.\n\nAlabama friends live a few feet into the state line which is also the line between Central and Eastern time zones They go through life living in both zines. I don't know how they are on time for anything.\n\nTrips to Newfoundland include setting my watch 90 minutes behind Eastern time.\n\nFour of the world's thirty-eight time zones are in the lower 48 states but what about the other two states?\n\nMost of Alaska is in the same zone as the west coast but what about the Aleutian Islands that swing out into the Pacific towards Russia?\n\nThey are in the zone with Hawaii and most of the time they are six hours behind local time here.\n\nMy mother had a small rose garden behind their house. She was very proud of the garden and the walkway made of old brick. In the middle was a sundial. She loved that sundial and constantly compared it to her kitchen clock.\n\nIt was never close.\n\nBob Seger's âMain Streetâ played in the juke box of my mind as the Interstate morphed into state and county roads and a few brick-paved Main Streets of small towns of my road trip.\n\nA stroll of small towns once home to me led from door to door on Main Street.\n\nâDime Storesâ thrived on low-priced items. A balsa glider, if it survived, cost a dime and was good for a full day. Some boys made it climb and soar, but other boys (me) crashed them in seconds.\n\nLooking like a bank building, which it was, faced with red bricks and imitation concrete columns suggested âstabilityâ A partial sign reading ântistâ is on a second-floor window opaque with dust. I wonder how long patients climbed the stairs until he moved along. Or maybe he never did.\n\nMr. Deroy Elder's son, âBen,â and I were classmates. Mr. Elder owned and operated a local shoe repair shop. He and his wife, Dorothy, died two months apart.\n\nOnly one telephone operator worked on the second floor of âMiller's Dry Goods Store.â Standing in front of M. G. Richardson's store I wonder at the young women who looked out of the window to watch the action on the street, when there was action.\n\nTrains stopped running decades ago followed by bus lines until they permanently parked.\n\nâPhil and Mil'sâ cafe' caught traveling traffic and visits by locals. There is nothing there, as gone as if it never existed.\n\nHolding a picture of the cafe' I try to place it exactly. The picture was taken on a day when spring was bringing renewal to all but the cafe'.\n\nThe âSanitary Barber Shopâ very likely was but boys dreaded the place because Mr. Carter grabbed a boy's head like a soft ball and held it in place while the clippers hummed on.\n\nThe independent gas station was replaced by a convenience store selling fuel. The doctor who delivered half the town retired and was not replaced. A Nurse Practitioner sees non-emergency patients and the small hospital closed.\n\nThere is one locally owned grocery store. Others were squeezed shut in favor of a big box store twenty miles away and the low profit remains are picked over by a dollar type store.\n\nThe obdurate lumber yard hangs on while locals shop for building materials forty miles away. The county and city rarely use local contractors. They could. They should.\n\nShopping local is the key to keeping a viable business community. Sometimes as few as a dozen shoppers makes the difference in whether a business operates at a profit or loss on any particular day.\n\nThe brick chimney will continue to lean, grass growing in the sidewalk cracks and mortar drying and blowing from between bricks.\n\nGone are the pool rooms, soft drink bottlers, drug stores, small shops, retired men sitting on benches. My father called them âsidewalk superintendents.â They are gone also.\n\nJoe Phillips . . . DEAR ME 19 May 2024\n\nFree light show!\n\nAlabama friends sent pictures of their Northern Lights last week attaching a note that made me feel they had earned their lights and I didn't.\n\nThey were mostly green and it looked like a waterfall or a thin curtain.\n\nThe Alabama folks were proud of their lights and they are so cheap they probably tried to catch some in a jar.\n\nI know people who traveled to Norway to see the lights and related the experience in spiritual terms, laced with adverbs, and then were quiet for a while as if they just come down from a trip on LSD.\n\nThat tugged at a memory of catching fireflies in a Mason jar for a lantern that didn't produce any light but who can forget the firefly smell on your hands?\n\nI'd like to see the Northern Lights someday in Alaska or a place where they run all night.\n\nI fired back that there are natural lights in the sky we do not see due to âlight pollutionâ but they are there. I've seen the edge of the Milky Way as a Boy Scout while camping in a field near the Okefenokee Swamp.\n\nThe city of Waycross was the nearest town but their lights were hidden by a forest.\n\nWe didn't know it but we were close to a spot that one day would be certified as a âDark Sky Place.â\n\nWe lay on blankets waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dark, watching for passing airplanes and our patience was soon rewarded. There is a fantastic light show above your head if only you can find a place dark enough to see it.\n\nThe âMilky Wayâ is the edge of our galaxy containing billions of stars and planets; so much so that it looks like a cloud. On a clear night, you can see it with unaided eyes.\n\nAt home, I gushed to my parents at what I had seen but it was no news to them. They both grew up on farms in a day when homes were lighted by kerosene lanterns when they were lighted at all.\n\nTheir night skies were free of light pollution and they knew the stars and constellations by name.\n\nIf you can get far enough away from town and security lights you will be amazed at how a clear night sky can be populated like sprinkled sugar on black velvet.\n\nThere are summer meteor showers that might be visible in town but certainly on a lightly traveled road. They were called âfalling starsâ but they were not falling nor were the stars.\n\nMy brother-in-law and I used to our talking on the dirt road that ran by his grandparent's Kansas farmhouse. There was too much ambient light to fully gain our night sight but after a half hour of no traffic, we were almost there.\n\nThen a deputy came to investigate why two guys were standing in the middle of the road.\n\nWe thanked him for his service and for running our night vision with his blue strobes.\n\nI don't know when, if ever, I'll see the Northern Lights but until I do I can be content with the night light show at hand.\n\nIt's Friday.\n\nWell, sort of. It is Friday as I start this note to you.\n\nThe Glenn Miller Orchestra made two films in 1941 and 1942. Actress Lynn Bari starred in both as âgirl singersâ of the Miller Orchestra.\n\nApparently, Miss Bari didn't sing, or didn't sing well enough, so the studio employed a âghost singer, Patricia Friday, professionally known as âPat Friday.â\n\nGhost singers were paid for their work but did not receive credit.\n\nMiss Friday and her husband were neighbors of a struggling radio actor/producer who sought to make a career from cop dramas, Jack Webb.\n\nWebb was wildly successful with his radio, then television shows. He created âJoe Fridayâ admitting he borrowed the last name from his neighbor.\n\nThe show's theme song is identifiable to anyone who heard âDUM â de â DUM â DUM.â\n\nPat Friday didn't have the looks of a Lynn Bari, few women did. She had marginal success as a singer under her own name but found her niche as a ghost singer.\n\nIn the film âSun Valley Serenadeâ Miss Friday is heard with Ray Eberle singing the original version of âAt Lastâ which was written for that film and made famous again by Etta James in 1960.\n\nThe same song writers penned âI Know Why and So Do Youâ which featured Miss Friday but not in the 78 rpm recordings of both songs.\n\nIf you enjoyed Marni Nixon's singing you didn't know it.\n\nMs. Nixon was another âghost singerâ whose voice was dubbed for Debra Kerr in âThe King and I,â Natalie Wood in âWestside Story,â and Audrey Hepburn in âMy Fair Lady.â\n\nWhile the actresses were very well paid for their performances Ms. Nixon wasn't paid enough to buy a used car.\n\nAll three of these films were nominated for Academy Awards and soundtrack recordings added to the pile of cash. It was Ms. Nixon's un-credited voice on the recordings. Nope, not even a used car.\n\nShe finally appeared as a voice with a face and a name. She was cast as one of the singing nuns in the film, âThe Sound of Music.â\n\nAlso, in that film it was not Christopher Plummer singing âEdelweissâ but ghost singer, Bill Lee.\n\nMs. Nixon died in New York City in 2016, the same year we lost Patricia Vinson at age 94 in Fredericksburg, Texas.\n\nTime for another cemetery tour."
