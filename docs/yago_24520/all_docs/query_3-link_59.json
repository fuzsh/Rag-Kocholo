        "text": "Not quite, R4.\n\nIf she were born later, she’d have been diagnosed bipolar and medicated. And, quite likely, doing a lot of DBT to address her Borderline tendencies.\n\nI just don’t think, particularly given the limited understanding of Bipolar Disorder (and BOD) in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, that she had the autonomy to “throw it away”. It’s a painful, wildly unstable diagnosis and one will do what they can to ease the pain.\n\nYou’re stupid, R4.\n\nHaving read a few bios of Judy, as well as a day-to-day timeline. It interested me how she had a lot of trouble showing up for work at MGM - going back to the middle 1940s. But right after leaving MGM, she did a show on Broadway at the Palace (winning a Tony) and was able to show up for that every night on time and give an amazing live performance. She also repeated this in London at the Palladium. After she was fired from MGM, Bing Crosby immediately had her on his radio show for numerous appearances. She also later seemed to be there for her TV show and appearances on shows like The Hollywood Palace. I have no answers but have wondered about the discrepancy.\n\nShe had sleep problems (probably stemming from when her sleep pattern was disrupted by MGM and given drugs). She had a lot of insomnia, and migraines. She had a hard time getting to a movie studio early in the morning (or even later in the day). She was no morning person. And I think she had a lot of passive-aggressive tendencies towards MGM, a love-hate relationship. Maybe making movies just was not her thing.\n\nI always think of how she called people late at night. Many friends were very indulgent to her about it. I read about how she would always call June Allyson and one night Dick Powell had to get on the phone and remind her June had to get up in the morning and go to work! Poor Judy, poor friends.\n\nRipped off by David Begelman:\n\n[quote]In 1993, a book by Coyne Steven Sanders, Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show (Morrow 1990), about the history of Judy Garland's CBS Television series The Judy Garland Show (1963–1964), devoted a chapter to possible embezzlement of Garland's funds by Begelman. Garland's estranged husband at the time, Sid Luft, hired an attorney to audit her income from the time Begelman began representing her with fellow agent Freddie Fields. It was discovered that several hundred thousand dollars were missing, much of it written in checks to \"Cash\" and endorsed by Begelman at various casinos in Las Vegas. Other entries in her accounts showed large sums paid for \"protection\" with no authorization, all approved by Begelman, though Garland had no personal security. In addition, a 1963 Cadillac convertible, given to Garland as partial payment for appearances on Jack Paar's television program, was titled to Begelman. Garland never knew the car was part of her compensation for her appearance.\n\n[quote]In addition, Begelman told Garland a photo existed of her, partially nude, having her stomach pumped in a hospital emergency room after a drug overdose in London, and that blackmailers were demanding $50,000 to turn over the picture and all negatives. As she was in negotiations with CBS at the time for her new television series, Garland paid rather than face the adverse publicity and potentially damaging the deal's prospects. Luft's attorney eventually determined that the check went to a holding company with a business address in New York City owned by Begelman, and was further traced to a personal account of Begelman.\n\nKirk Douglas said a good illustration of Hollywood was that David Begelman got a standing ovation at the Academy Awards, while Cliff Robertson (who Begelman ripped off and embezzled from) was blacklisted for revealing the truth about Begelman.\n\nShe wasnt exploited any more than any other show business phenom. Her mother introduced her to amphetamines and barbiturates before she was 12. Whitney as well was introduced to drugs by her brothers long before her first success. There are examples of great talent going down the drain in a haze of substance abuse and examples of those who do not. Having great talent and huge success early in life is hard to handle. For whatever reasons, neither Whitney, nor Judy had there wherewithal to handle it. Sure sharks were all around- but that does not consign blame to them.\n\nPS, Judy was long gone and lost well before Begelman took advantage of her. He tried to step in on early Streisand too and got nowhere. Judy simply never had the ability to take care of herself from a very early age. She was, like a good addict, incredibly adept at keeping the flow c of substances going, even when broke- normal addict behavior.\n\nI am a huge fan of Garland. Her talent was gargantuan and her work, show biz genius. But her life was in large part was incredibly tragic. And I gather her addictions turned her into a bit of a monster, which very normal in those as deep into it as she was-\n\n[quote] PS, Judy was long gone and lost well before Begelman took advantage of her. He tried to step in on early Streisand too and got nowhere. Judy simply never had the ability to take care of herself from a very early age.\n\nI don't understand, are you victim-blaming? The things he did were serious crimes. It doesn't matter who he did them to. She had as much right to her earnings as anyone else. She literally got ripped off, which is the subject of the thread.\n\n[quote]I always think of how she called people late at night. Many friends were very indulgent to her about it. I read about how she would always call June Allyson and one night Dick Powell had to get on the phone and remind her June had to get up in the morning and go to work! Poor Judy, poor friends.\n\nMontgomery Clift was the same way. He was a lonely, needy, insomniac who would call friends at all hours of the night, chatting endlessly with exhausted and exasperated friends. Eventually, those friends abandoned him to save their health and sanity. Not surprisingly, Monty and Judy were good friends. They probably had the same dealer.\n\nThe fact that these people were friends, and put up with more than one late night phone call, ought to prove to anyone that there was something there that was worth putting up with.\n\nJudy was good to a lot of people and a lot of people liked her. Leslie Caron said the person she remembered being the most sincerely friendly and welcoming when she came to Hollywood was Judy. Yeah, later most of them were sick of her because she was chaotic. I don't think she was as bad earlier as she got to be later.\n\nI feel bad for Ethel Gumm in certain ways. She was married to a gay man who was getting involved with teenage boys and got run out of town. She had a boyfriend, who followed then to California when they moved from Minnesota...but I don't blame her. She probably needed to turn to someone. Judy resented her for making her get an abortion for her career when she was married to David Rose. I don't blame Judy for that. Also, not unusually (for young Hollywood stars, then), Judy more or less supported the mom and sisters and they lived in Judy's house. It must be weird supporting your family when you're a teenager. Judy's estranged mom died while working as a file clerk in Santa Monica and was found slumped between two cars in her work parking lot, in her late 50s. Judy's dad (ten years older than her mom) had died at 49.\n\nGrand Rapids, Minnesota was in the \"Goiter Belt\" (where food was grown in iodine-depleted soil) and both parents suffered from the condition.\n\n[quote]She needed medication for bi-polar. No amount of drying out can help that.\n\nWhere does this diagnosis come from? It's modern gibberish. Judy had a drug and later drug + booze problem. I'm certain amphetamine use mimics mania to a degree. Those things get worse if not treated and hers got worse.\n\nA therapist in Boston told her flat out she was too much Judy Garland and not enough Frances Gumm, which Judy refuted explaining that everyone LOVED \"Judy Garland\", so what could being more Frances Gumm ever do for her. It's a very basic question. It never resolved in her favor.\n\nPatty Duke said she believed Judy was bi-polar, and if anyone knew how to recognize bi-polar...\n\nI agree. I love them both. Keep in mind also, that cunt Ethel didn't want any more children, then along came Frances. Ethel would go out of her way to tell anyone who would listen Judy was unwanted and a burden, always making sure Judy was within earshot. That's gotta fuck with your head, which is probably why the fat bitch did it. I don't think Ethel was playing with a full deck herself.\n\nPopularity of wines and wine brands change over time. Wine drinking was not that popular then. There weren't these wine stores with thousands of wines. That was a popular brand at the time.\n\nOne of Judy's biographers said Judy had asthma as a kid, and that Ethel would bed her down in the back seat of their car and drive out to the desert (when they lived in Lancaster, CA) and drive her around all night so she could sleep, in the dry air. That sounds like a pretty devoted mother.\n\nAlso - amphetamines were given for asthma in those days. Maybe that's when Judy first encountered them.\n\nJudy was basically sold by her mother to MGM. Judy didn't know the business side if things; why wud she. She didn't know how to be a business person and she didn't know her worth. When she needed rest she wasn't allowed enough time off. When they eventually fired her, she was set adrift..and wasn't rich. Sid Luft steered her to huge success but once again Judy didn't understand business and She ended up owing the taxman. She had little or no other avenues to take; she wasn't educated; she had to keep on that treadmill and everyone took advantage. It seems eerily similar with Britney and Whitney too..they weren't qualified to do anything else and people were making money so they had to keep singing. Judy was absolutely not responsible. She was a sweetheart.\n\nr41, Judy had A LOT invested in making her mother the villain in her life. To be sure, Ethel Gum was an ambitious and driven stage mother who acted out her own ambitions on her daughters, but much of her story was embellished by Judy after Ethel died.\n\nOn later review it has been determined that for a financial layman Ethel did a good job managing Judy's finances on the whole. She also adamantly argued with Mayer and MGM that they were overworking her daughter and damaging her health. In early 1943 when Judy was still twenty and considered a minor, Ethel was banned from the lot and that was her done, Judy's last real advocate.\n\nOn Youtube there's color home movie footage of Judy and Ethel gardening and repotting plants in what looks like 1947 (based on baby Liza's age in them). This was during the disastrous year of \"The Pirate\", but you'd never know it from looking at them getting along just fine. I believe things really went south for them in 1949, where Judy later claims Ethel suggested a frontal lobotomy as treatment for her daughter. In her defense, it was currently being done for people with issues.\n\nR22. I am not victim blaming. Begelman I believe committed suicide due to his being brought to justice. Sid Luft (ironically) knew he was ripping her off- tried to intervene but Judy being Judy fucked up. Judy was broke and in debt most of her life because she put herself in the hands of people like Begelman. Mickie Deans was using her as well at the end of her life.\n\nJudy could not take care of herself from the get go. And unfortunately, like most addicts, she attracted to worst. Surely life experience has taught you this R22. Gave you ever known a long term addict and alcoholic, like Judy? Ditto Whitney only she was luckier than Judy. Clive Davis was not a crook. But she married a total gutter dweller. Why? Because that’s where her addictions lived.\n\nSad, sad, sad.\n\nR52 Begelman was a major agent and VP, with MCA. He left in the early 60s and formed CMA with Freddie Fields. They had big clients including, yes, Steisand, and Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, McQueen, Astaire, etc. They told Judy they were going to return her to movies (they did - Judgment at Nuremburg, I Could Go On Singing, Gay Puree) and get her into TV (The Judy Garland Show), and get her a recording contract - etc. She wasn't stupid to sign with them, she didn't know what was going to happen.\n\nQuite a few performers in those days were addicted to drugs and alcohol. Marilyn Monroe. Sinatra drank a fifth of Scotch a day. Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn, Robert Young, Dana Andrews and Clark Gable were alcoholics. So was Jack Lemmon. Begelman still ripped Judy off.\n\nR52 I think she was only broke and in debt after the 1950s. She didn't always attract the worst. She was married to a successful composer-arranger (Rose) a successful director (Minnelli). She had romances with some people one would hardly call \"the worst\" - Tyrone Power, for one. She had friends like Bogart and Bacall, June Allyson and Dick Powell. Kay Thompson (who went south later, but was doing okay then), Syvia Sidney. I agree she was a mess due to her addiction (which might actually have been her self-medicating, due to other mental and emotional issues). Even in her mid to late 20s. She also didn't have a normal childhood at all, being on the road in vaudeville, then at MGM.\n\nR37, one of the most salient facts about addiction is that the only person who can change it, is the addict. Garland and Whitney could not and therefore they lived with the wolves. Do you know any addicts or alcoholics R37? There were many other film stars at Metro, and Clive Davis managed many other singers. But Whitney married Bobby Brown and Judy put herself in the hands of a grifter who enabled her habit late in her short life- he even put minders on her to both feed and try to control the habit. That is why she went into business with him- she paid no attention to money or taxes. Bobby was an addict too- so Whitney married him. I have loved at least one addict and it nearly killed me to try and help him until I realized I could not- ever. Many circumstances get someone into trouble with substances. Only one thing gets them out (themself). Until that time their entire lives are one huge mess- that often hurt others and end in an early demise- all which happened to Judy and Whitney and countless others both famous and not famous.\n\nR77\n\n[quote]Immediately after the repeal of Prohibition, wine consumption dropped as Americans had renewed access to spirits and beer. From the repeal of Prohibition to the late 1950s, high-alcohol dessert and fortified wines dominated the market. These were the darkest days of the history of wine production and consumption. Many fortified wines were produced and sold extremely cheaply, and catered to the \"misery market\". \"Winos\" drank these overly alcoholic concoctions because they were the cheapest way to get drunk. In the quest for short-term profits, unscrupulous producers stamped a black mark on the history of wine in America.\n\n[quote]From 1934 to the early 1950s, immigrant families consumed the majority of table wines. Unfortunately, many of their offspring did not follow their parents traditional drink choices and began consuming beer and cocktails as they assimilated into American society. Table wine was a mysterious beverage to most Americans and was associated with high-society and recent arrivals from Southern and Central Europe.\n\n[quote]America's taste for non-fortified wines finally began to develop in the early 1960s. The majority of these new wine drinkers were young, well-traveled, and relatively affluent. As the Baby Boom generation came of age, the ranks of wine drinkers increased. Even still, the majority of consumers bought simple, sweet wines.\n\nBlue Nun (Liebfraumilch) is a simple, sweet wine.\n\nLet me know which part of any of this you can't understand.\n\nTo me, Streisand is not a moving singer, though it's apples and oranges. I just happen to like apples (Judy) more than oranges. Streisand is a mediocre actress, besides. Not saying she's bad. But Judy was a much better actress. I mean you can debate how well she utilized that talent, but she had the talent.\n\nI took a wine tasting course at college with a well-regarded professor. He said Blue Nun was a good, inexpensive wine to have with certain foods, like American Chinese. He said it in a \"no kidding\" kind of way - he wasn't a wine snob. Blue Nun was looked down on but that took a while. In the early 60s (when Judy was into it) it was still sort of trendy.\n\nIt is no surprise that Judy drank Blue Nun, she fit the demographic of people who did, as outlined in R82. As mentioned above Blue Nun had an add campaign in the late 60s with Stiller and Meara; another wine that advertised heavily at the time was Mateus Rose. These were inexpensive, sweet wines that were marketed to the lower and middle middle classes. Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill - even cheaper and sweeter - was pitched to the college and high school crowd.\n\nThere was nothing about any of them that wine-snobs would like, but there were many fewer wine snobs in America at the time. There was also nothing about them that more experienced wine drinkers would really enjoy, but there weren't many of those in mass-market America at that time either.\n\nBette Davis’s mother, Ruthie, always reminded Bette about the sacrifices she made on Bette’s behalf. She indeed worked tirelessly and sacrificed a great deal before Bette became a star.\n\nOnce Bette was rich and famous, her mother was a parasite. If Bette bought a mink coat, Ruthie wanted one, too. She bought cars, jewelry and spent Bette’s money lavishly. Bette fought with her constantly, for her feckless and spendthrift ways. Bette allowed it out of guilt. Before Ruthie died, she asked Bette to bury her in a solid silver casket. She got her wish, though Bette was enraged.\n\nBette Davis was extravagant, herself. Had she saved her money and invested it wisely, could’ve selected better projects, like Katharine Hepburn did. Hepburn was wealthy, Bette was wasn’t.\n\nIt's a pity Judy Garland fell apart before her time because she was a courageous entertainer. Fearless. And could surprise you. A Child Is Waiting, 2nd to last film, is a good performance. Bette Davis was fearless and if her lack of wealth forced her to take odd projects, she didn't phone in her performances. I say even Joan Crawford managed creative and surprising performances in middle age and beyond. Katharine Hepburn's most compelling work was in the 1940s, for crissakes! IMO. The 50s were uneven. I don't find surprising performances by Hepburn after the 40s but I haven't seen all the second half of career. She annoys me and I don't like spending 2 hours with her.\n\nRight, [R113], but was there any type of organization specifically for actors/actresses that could have helped Judy with finances, housing, rehab? I thought they existed, but maybe not. She’s someone who never should have had to struggle financially. She’s a Hollywood legend. Hollywood should have had her back.\n\nIn the film Judy, she was portrayed as not having enough money for housing and couldn’t afford to pay her hotel bills. You’d think someone in Hollywood would have housed her. Frank Sinatra used to take care of stars in various capacities. Who helped Judy?\n\nShe was only 47. She had a long career ahead of her. Concerts, film, Love Boat. She'd have only been mid sixties in the late eighties... she could have done a night time soap and ridden that trend wave of hiring great stars for TV. Judy Garland is Constance Colby. Judy Garland is Jacqueline Perrault. Or Judy Garland is Miss fucking Ellie.\n\nWhat she needed, poor lady, was to beat the pills and the booze to the extent it was a problem. Did the care exist then to make it happen? Or had so many years passed her brain was so changed there was never any hope?\n\n47 was very young to die, even if you'd crammed eighty years of hard living into it.\n\nYears ago, somebody here posted this of Garland singing an obscure, wrist-slasher, December holidays song called \"After the Holidays\".\n\nI thought I'd plumbed every emotion one can have about December holidays until I heard and saw this. And, to me anyway, it only adds to the unbearable poignancy that Garland's voice is shot.\n\nAnd, if you've ever felt the inevitability of a break-up around the holidays, this is tooo much.\n\nMy dad watched The Wizard Of Oz with me (on its yearly broadcast) and my mom used to play her Carnegie Hall album. They liked her and like many people almost never talked a lot about her drug use, drinking, or suicide attempts. I hear a lot more about that now than when she was alive. You can’t look at any Youtube video featuring Judy that don’t have comments sections full of posts about her drug addiction and how sad her life was. Over and over.\n\nSomeone asked why people in Hollywood didn’t try to help her- they did- over and over. Sinatra rescued her financially a number of times. I’m surprised that many on this thread are a bit naive of the cost of serious addiction. She was an addict and alcoholic. No one can rescue anyone from that. No one. Only the addict. I have lost several friends and one uncle to addiction. All were offered help repeatedly over the years of their addictions until finally killed by them. I also have friends who have recovered. And they did so by some fiat of luck that made them realize they had to stop. And yes, in Judy’s time AA and NA were fledgling 12-steps. But she was in at least two dry out clinics. It just never stuck for her.\n\nI agree 142- it sounds easy but of course it is not. My point is that it’s the addict that has to hit a bottom of some sort that gets them to stop. I’ve seen an intervention work. But for every time someone has somehow stopped, I know of more who could not and it destroyed them. I might add that the desire to stop usually requires help- lots of it. But the desire has to come from the addict.\n\nR172 Well, I just meant - he was some guy in Hollywood (reminding me of Steve Crane, who was a grifter who eventually made good) - a test pilot - who married first Lynn Bari, then Judy. He was trying to be an entrepreneur, he became a producer - he produced a Bowery Boys movie, somehow - then A Star Is Born - and never produced another film. Did he ever have a job, after that? As you say, he pissed away Judy’s money. hat doesn’t sound like it was his own money. Did he make his own money?\n\nI've been watching her TV show lately. She was great but it wasn't always a great show. I fast forwarded through a few of the guests' numbers. I enjoyed the show with June Allyson and the one with Streisand. The one with Liza was annoying because Liza was annoying. She got better later. She wanted to be a dancer to begin with but she wasn't a great dancer. She reminded me of her Punchy Players parody. Also enjoyed a conversation with Steve Allen."
