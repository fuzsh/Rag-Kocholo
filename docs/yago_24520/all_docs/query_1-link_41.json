Other elements of the movie, like Garland's wedding to Mickey Deans and her performances with her youngest children, are inspired by recorded events as well.\n\nRead more: Renée Zellweger gives a heartbreaking, Oscar-worthy performance as troubled Judy Garland\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also flashbacks to younger Judy Garland throughout the movie.\n\nHere's what Judy Garland looked like in the mid 1940s, several years after her breakout role in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nRead more: 7 of Judy Garland's most iconic films\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActress Darci Shaw plays Garland for the period of time when she was cast in the legendary film \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nThe costume design and hair/makeup styling in \"Judy\" does wonders to help match both Zellweger and Shaw to Judy Garland's iconic look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiza Minnelli is Judy Garland's eldest child, born in 1946.\n\nGarland married director Vincente Minnelli (\"Meet Me in St. Louis\") in 1945, and they divorced in 1951.\n\nMinnelli, played by Gemma-Leah Devereux in \"Judy,\" was 22 years old when her mother died.\n\nMinnelli makes an appearance in the movie, along with Garland's other two children (whom she had with her third husband).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarland married her tour manager and producer Sidney \"Sid\" Luft in 1952.\n\nThey were married for 13 years and divorced around the same time Garland remarried.\n\nSid Luft is played by Rufus Sewell in \"Judy.\"\n\nThe film deals with Garland and Luft's custody dispute over their two children, Lorna and Joey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorna and Joey Luft were born in 1952 and 1955, respectively, and performed several shows with their mother.\n\nJust as Liza Minnelli had before them, Garland's two children sang and played music with her on stage for some of her public performances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoey and Lorna Luft appear as characters in \"Judy,\" played by Lewin Lloyd and Bella Ramsey.\n\nYou probably recognize actress Bella Ramsey from HBO's \"Game of Thrones,\" where she played the young Lady Lyanna Mormont.\n\nRead more: What 41 actors who were killed on 'Game of Thrones' are doing now\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarland's fifth, and last, husband was actor Mickey Deans.\n\nDeans was the manager of a nightclub and a musician. He married Garland shortly before she died. He was her fifth husband.\n\nDeans is played by Finn Wittrock in \"Judy,\" and has a large presence in the movie during Garland's final year of living.\n\nThe movie makes no mention of Garland's fourth husband, Mark Herron, focusing on her relationship with Sid Luft and Deans instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Judy\" features scenes straight from Garland and Deans' real relationship, including some from their wedding day.\n\nIn this photo, snapped at the Chelsea Register Office in London, Garland embraces both Deans (right) and best man Johnnie Ray.\n\nThe wedding scene was recreated for \"Judy,\" with actor John Mackay playing Johnnie Ray.\n\nThe film even brought to life Garland's memorable matching blue hat and dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast but certainly not least, \"Judy\" features the production assistant, Rosalyn Wilder, who worked closely with Garland in her final months.\n\nPlayed by actress Jessie Buckley, Wilder appears in the movie as one of the key people surrounding Garland as she attempted her comeback tour on stage.\n\nThe real Wilder was a behind-the-scenes person in Garland's life, and therefore was not often publicly photographed with the singer, but she visited the set of the movie and talked with Buckley about her experience with Garland.\n\n\"Judy\" arrives in theaters this Friday.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
