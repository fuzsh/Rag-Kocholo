        "text": "ET sat down with the late Judy Garland's daughters, Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft, for a special ET exclusive, and they shared priceless memories of growing up with the beloved movie star as their mother.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz star would have been 100 years old on June 10, but she died in 1969 of an accidental drug overdose. She was 47 years old. Garland had 75-year-old Minnelli with her second husband, Vincente Minnelli, and 69-year-old Luft is Garland's daughter with her third husband, Sidney Luft. The two talked to ET's Kevin Frazier about getting to spend time with legendary stars growing up thanks to their mother, including Humphrey Bogart, Lana Turner and Sammy Cahn.\n\n\"But it was so funny, if Momma was in the room, nobody cared,\" Minnelli notes about Garland's charisma even amid other stars. \"She was so funny. She was fun.\"\n\nLuft adds, \"I know this is going to sound strange, but I've said it so many times, it was our normal. We didn't know they were famous; we didn't know they were different. They were our parents' friends. That was the neighborhood.\"\n\nLiza is a nice woman and a huge talent in her own right who will forever be remembered for starring in Cabaret which may be the best movie musical ever. It remains a timeless film- not dated. I gave enormous sympathy for her family. Judy was a genius and I believe she loved her children, and they her. But she was a self destructive addict of the first order and as brilliant as she was, she was tragic and essentially abandoned by her family in the last few years of her life because she was so impossible- literally unsafe as a mother to her children. Her daughters never talk about this. They okay this down because they don’t want addiction to be Garjands legacy. I think they know otherwise because as much as they each have had show business success, Garlands legacy played out in their own addictions. It’s harrowing to read about Garlands life- she could be a maniac both professionally and in private.. It’s painful at times to watch her perform as great as she was- she is high and drunk much of the time, even when she’s in relatively good voice. She literally had not slept for 2 days before the famous Carnegie Hall concert. You know how she got through it. What would she have been if not an addict?\n\nI don't think Sid Lift was as bad as he's been made out to be. The Atlantic did a piece about him called \"The Least Worst Man\" which depicted him as the husband who stuck by Judy the longest and who truly cared about her:\n\n\"Sid Luft was the nearest Judy Garland came to the man that didn't get away. By the end the nights were bitter, the star had lost her glitter, but he was hanging in there. The longest-lasting of her five husbands, he played Mister Judy Garland from 1952 to 1965—or half her adult life, if one can call it that. Unlike his predecessor, he was not \"musical,\" in either the artistic or the euphemistic sense; unlike his successor, he was not voraciously gay. A scrappy, gravelly little guy known as One-Punch Luft, he was an all but unique figure: a rare friend of Judy who wasn't a friend of Dorothy. And as a result, folks can't figure out what he saw in her. For a long time the received wisdom was that he was a sleazy opportunist who'd hitched himself to her coattails and then milked her as long as he could. Yet insofar as there was a second act to Garland's career, he was its impresario: A Star Is Born, the great Capitol albums, Carnegie Hall and the London Palladium, the TV specials and weekly variety show that got closer than anything to the real Judy—all these are from the Luft years.\"\n\nAfter their divorce Judy raked him over the coals, depicting him as terrible and blaming him for her money problems. But Judy was largely full of shit. From the time she became an adult Judy Garland was to blame for ALL of her problems. But she always blamed somebody else for her miseries, as addicts and alcoholics tend to do.\n\nR125, yes they take that pose and I’m sure they loved their Mom and she them. I can understand why they want their mother to be remembered for her body of work. And yes it’s extraordinary from film, to record to stage. I’mn the other hand Facts are Sid had to take Lorna and Joey away from Judy in about 1966 or 7 because she was unfit. Liza stopped taking her calls as did just about every one. She sang for $100 a night at a small gay bar on the Upper East Side on Manhattan. Read some of the serious biographies of her life- heck, read Lorna’s book! It’s harrowing. Peter (what becomes a legend most) Rogers told me about her shoot in NYC- she never slept, trashed her hotel room etc. I also found it strange that as she grew older in the 1969s Judy acquired this sort of society women ascent and affect. One of the reasons I couldn’t watch the Rene Z film of her last London gig was because it was about as close to the truth as Trump is. Her teeth and gums needed big time work- she could barely stand much less finish a sentence. She was dying. Liza and Lorna know all of this.\n\nRelationships are complicated. Sid Luft was a grifter who lived off women--he did the same thing to his first wife, B-movie star Lynn Bari--but he also could have sincerely loved Judy and wanted her to be happy and successful. She had her most stable adult years when she was with Sid, after suffering a serious nervous breakdown while married to Minnelli (which was partly post-partum depression and partly the result of years of overwork and pill abuse). Once she and Sid broke up, Judy never really had a stable life again.\n\nI read Stevie Phillips' book, and while it was a juicy read, I wonder if some things were exaggerated. She was not a totally stable personality herself by her own admission--she went through three disastrous marriages of her own as well as problems with alcohol. It was also clear she still bore a grudge against Liza for firing her as a manager, and that could have colored some of her recollections.\n\nJudy's husbands:\n\nDavid Rose. Her starter marriage. She married him when she was a teenager, probably in large part just to be independent of her mother. But she was not ready to be married and be in charge of a household. He was a nice, if boring, guy. She had an abortion while married to him. He was a very talented musician who made a good living on his own, so he was not after her money. Their parting was amicable.\n\nVincente Minnelli. Gay. It was obvious that he was, but she considered his penchant for doing things like wearing makeup just his \"artistic flair.\" He was the first director to make her look beautiful on film, which made her attracted to him. He didn't need her money either; he was a top Hollywood director. They had Liza, and for a while they were quite a Hollywood couple. But very few marriages where the husband likes cock is going to last. They divorced and later Judy said nasty, untrue things like saying she'd raised Liza all on her own. Of course she didn't.\n\nSid Luft. He seemed to have no real profession, although he was called \"a show business figure.\" He stayed with Judy the longest; 13 years. He helped rejuvenate her career with his efforts. They had one of those violent, up and down, Hollywood relationships. They had two children and she had at least one abortion during their relationship. He had his faults but he stuck by her the longest. Later she'd rake him over the coals saying he abused her and squandered her money. I suppose there was truth to that but Judy was not the most credible person in the world.\n\nMark Herron. Gay. A younger man, an actor. Judy needed a man and he was willing to be her husband. They separated after five months of marriage. She claimed he beat but he said he only struck in in \"self defense.\" I believe that. Herron supposedly had sex with Peter Allen while Allen was married to LIza Minnelli. How gross.\n\nMickey Deans. Gay. He's been described as a disco owner, jazz pianist, and drug dealer.\" He was quite dreadful, a sleazy nobody. Judy gushed that she'd never known true love \"until I met Mickey.\" By the time they married she was half dead. Photos of her at that time show her looking like a rotting corpse. They'd barely been married before he found her seated on the toilet, dead.\n\nJudy sure could pick 'em.\n\nLiza exercised her independence very early. At a young age she was a popular performer, making very good money. She loved Judy but she also knew Judy was nuts and an addict and I'm sure she wanted to get away from the craziness.\n\nGerald Clarke, an idiot biographer of Judy who wrote the sleazy tome \"Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland\" said that Judy wanted to keep little Liza away from her grandmother Ethel because Ethel was trying to \"push\" Liza into show business the way she'd \"pushed\" poor Judy. What horseshit! Liza Minnelli needed NO \"pushing\" into the entertainment industry. From childhood she was singing and acting and wanted to be a star, and she obtained success early. She needed no '\"pushing\" from anyone. Neither, for that matter, did Judy Garland. She was first brought onto a stage as a toddler; she loved the applause so much she practically had to be dragged off. Judy Garland, also from a very young age, wanted to sing and act and be a star. No \"pushing\" was needed.\n\nR202 Agreed she was, or could be. The great \"what if\" is would she have been such a piece of work with different adults in her life, different husbands, different agents.\n\nSid may have \"come to the rescue' post-MGM, but he also helped dig the financial hole she couldn't get out of, and then Begelman and Fields came along made it worse...as well as the high tax percentages that no one pays anymore. The woman did the work and was a top earner until nearly the very end of her life. She is culpable in her situation, as we all are in our own, but it's worth remembering that as smart as she was, she only had an MGM schoolhouse level formal education.\n\nNot Freed, but Pasternak apparently did the best job managing her late in her MGM career by simply treating her kindly and not starving her.\n\n[quote] I read that she was fired from Valley of the Dolls because she was found passed on out a pool table, flashing everyone who passed her pussy.\n\nI recall that scenario from Gerald Clarke's sleazy biography of Judy entitled \"Get Happy.\" Clarke is a big old Judy queen; he adores her and believes everything she said, not seeming to realize that Judy loved to make up stories in order to entertain an audience and that drug addicts are notorious liars. He believes her when she said that when she started work at age at MGM studios at age 13 all the men were after her plump little humpbacked bod, including Louis B. Mayer. He portrays her as the blameless victim of everybody around her, especially her mother, who he depicts as evil incarnate and solely to blame for Judy's lifelong love affair with drugs. When poor Ethel Gumm laments \"Why does she hate me so?\" Clarke answers that question for her in so many words: \"Because you're an evil, wicked woman who forced her into show business and made her a drug addict!\" Yes, Clarke does love his Judy. But he also has no qualms about digging up all the sleazy dirt he can on her. For instance, he claimed that she would fellate her gay lovers under tables in restaurants. He said one of her lovers asked her to sing a few bars of \"Over The Rainbow\" for him after she'd just given him a blow job; she obliged and sang for him \"through a mouthful of semen.\" And he claims that she enjoyed the lesbo sex, saying \"when you've eaten everything in the world there is to eat you have to find new things.\" But he says lesbo sex with just a \"side dish\" on Judy's sexual menu; men were always \"the main course.\"\n\n[quote] you're appalled by Clarke's tawdry writing, but you proceed to rewrite all his sleazy tales here in DETAIL?!\n\nThis is DATALOUNGE, hon! THE place for \"sleazy tales.\" At any rate, I read his nasty book out of curiosity, to see if he had anything interesting or new to say about Garland. He didn't. He just talked about how mistreated she was and recounted gross stuff about her sex life and her drunk/drugged out behavior, like the pool table story. The folks at \"Valley of the Dolls\" wanted to make Judy happy so they gave her an antique pool table to amuse herself with (she liked playing pool) in her nice dressing room. Well, in a drug or alcohol haze she trashed the dressing room, damaged the pool table and was found lying on top of it with her dress hiked up so that her pubic hair was visible. Thanks for sharing that with us, Gerald! I've read several Judy Garland biographies. \"Get Happy\" is one of the worst ones.\n\nThe Gerold Frank bio from the 70s is one of the best. It was approved by her family and has exhaustive detail, especially on Judy's early life. It doesn't dwell on the worst of Judy's excesses while not completely giving her a pass. However, because it was published 50 years ago and had family input, Judy's father and all of her husbands are portrayed as heterosexual--which is probably why there is very little detail on Mark Herron or Mickey Deans (or Liza's husband Peter, for that matter).\n\nThere are a lot of Judy books that show how bad she got in later years, including Stevie Phillip's book, Rainbow's End (about her ill-fated TV show), and Lorna's Me and My Shadows. There are too many books by too many people for it not to be obvious that Judy was a fall-down fucking mess from the late 50s onwards.\n\nNow you've done it, R264. I have to post this clip. She made the credits but got there as the show was in its last season for 19 episodes, according to IMDB. They had the synthy theme that year instead of the caffeinated percussion-heavy version from earlier seasons.\n\nIt seems like Lorna almost happened in the 80s between features like Grease 2, Where the Boys Are '84, and a role on a series like Trapper John MD. Plus episodic guest shots like Murder She Wrote. And she was working in the theatre too, she did Extremities off-Broadway with Farrah.\n\nShe never had a label behind her singing career in the way Judy had Decca and Capitol, and Liza had Capitol and A&M.\n\nShe's about to do a concert in White Plains at the end of the month. How much does she make for a show like that?\n\nLorna was in her early 30s by the mid-80s. That was too old to really hit it big as a female star.\n\nBesides her lack of IT factor, Lorna was also an entitled bitch. Even in her biography she talks about losing out on auditions because she had too much \"New York attitude.\" Her agent told her to fake being nice if she couldn't be nice, and that helped, but it was still too late for her by then. If she'd gotten Grizabella and Gloria in the early 70s, she could have made it big, but that was her window and she missed it.\n\n[quote] The guy on these threads who always says that Judy brought everything on herself because, even as a toddler, she wanted to be a star, creeps me out more than almost any other of our Datalounge creeps. \"She was 3 years old, she made her choices, she asked for every bad thing that ever happened to her!\"\n\nWho ever said that? I think you're confused. At any rate, even as a small child Judy Garland was destined to be a performer. It was in her blood. And when she became an adult it was her own decisions that shaped her life, no one else's. Do you consider Judy a blameless victim? If so you much love her very much.\n\n[quote] Martha Raye. Wow. Talk about somebody who's totally forgotten today.\n\nShe was a star in a long gone era. Unless you're interested in performers from other eras she wouldn't be someone most people would have heard of. I remember a few things about her. She did a great deal of performing for troops during wartime and won honors for her efforts. She was politically conservative. She did a series of commercials for Polident, a denture cleaner. And when she was half dead and in her seventies she married a forty something, giggling, gay as a goose golddigger named Mark Harris. She was married a total of SEVEN times. She had one child, a daughter. She was evidently a terrible mother; she once said she regretted not having aborted her daughter. The daughter ended up committing suicide. Martha Raye sounds like she was a very unpleasant person.\n\n[quote] here is no indication on the Internet that her daughter, Melodye Condos(77), is deceased.\n\nI thought I heard somewhere that she killed herself. Anyway, she sued to get control of Raye's affairs, saying she was being used by her awful gold digging husband and of course that was true I don't know how the lawsuit came out, but I don't thinks she prevailed. As for Raye's husband Mark Harris...well, he is a piece of work. There was an article about him in the Washington Post that described the \"merry widower\" like this:\n\nThe Widow Raye is in a kittenish mood.\n\n\"What becomes a legend's husband the most,\" he vamps, slithering on the carpet of his Washington hotel suite wrapped in an ebony opera-length mink coat over a leopard-print blazer, camping it up like a 46-year-old Catskills hairdresser turned Vegas lounge lizard turned seventh husband of the recently deceased septuagenarian comedian Martha Raye.\n\nHis eyes are pale violet (\"I have Elizabeth Taylor eyes\") and he appears to be wearing eyeliner.\n\nOhh boyhhh!\n\nIn the annals of May-December marriages, stranger unions have occurred, especially in Hollywood, where men not unlike the fame-obsessed, pinkie-ringed, liposuctioned bisexual Mark Harris have been known to prey on older, wealthy divas with equal parts devotion and disdain.\n\nFor a monthly allowance, they blow-dry what's left of the diva's hair, do the shopping and cooking, remind the diva on a daily basis what a fabulous star she still is, and every so often are invited to share the diva's bed, although sexual performance is secondary to slavish attention and the will to gossip. They also are expected to listen patiently while the star drones on about Sammy Goldwyn or Hedda Hopper or the Brown Derby, often late into the night over several bottles of wine. In return, the young men -- usually frustrated performers -- bask in the fading glow of the spotlight, desperately cranking up the publicity machine like a teenager trying to push-start a '57 Chevy.\n\nThey also must learn the cliches: wishing they had been born earlier, feeling blessed they have even a short time together, and of course, not caring about the money. Estate? She left it to moi?"
