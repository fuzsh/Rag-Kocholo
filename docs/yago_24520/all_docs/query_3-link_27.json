        "text": "A Los Angeles U.S. District judge barred him from selling the replacement Juvenile Oscar Judy Garland received for \"The Wizard of Oz.\" He was also ordered to pay nearly $60,000 to The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to end their second lawsuit against him for repeatedly trying to sell the statuette. (September 2002)\n\nWas not on speaking terms with daughter Lorna Luft after the publishing of her unflattering memoir and the resulting TV-movie \"Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows\" in 2001.\n\nHad 4 children: a daughter (b. August 1945 but died shortly thereafter) & son, John Michael Luft (b. September 18, 1948) with 2nd ex-wife, Lynn Bari and daughter, Lorna Luft (b. November 21, 1952) & son, Joey Luft (b. March 29, 1955) with 3rd ex-wife, Judy Garland.\n\nWhile reviving her career at the London Palladium and the Palace Theatre in the early 1950s, it was his idea to have wife Judy Garland come down to the edge of the stage and sing \"Over the Rainbow\" for dramatic effect.\n\nJoined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1940 and later served as a World War II test pilot for Douglas Aircraft. He survived a near-fatal plane crash that caused severe burns to his legs and hands.\n\nThe ruggedly handsome and streetwise Luft, who grew up in a tough section of New York, was known for his heavy drinking and barroom brawling. He claims to have broken four noses in various altercations.\n\nA sometime producer and showman, he once worked as a talent agent in the late 40s."
