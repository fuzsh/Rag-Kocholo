A curvaceous, dark-haired WWII pin-up beauty (aka \"The Woo Woo Girl\" and \"The Girl with the Million Dollar Figure\"), \"B\" film star Lynn Bari had the requisite looks and talent but few of the lucky breaks needed to penetrate the \"A\" rankings during her extensive Hollywood career.

        "text": "While on the set of Shock (1946) one day, she was talking with co-star Anabel Shaw and mentioned that she was a direct descendant, on her mother's side, of Revolutionary War hero Alexander Hamilton. Shaw revealed that she was a direct descendant of Aaron Burr--the man who killed Hamilton in the famous duel.\n\nSecond only to Betty Grable in WWII pin-up popularity according to a GI's poll taken at the time.\n\nLynn had two children by former husband Sidney Luft, who later married and divorced Judy Garland. Her first, a daughter, was born in August of 1945 but died shortly thereafter. Lynn never quite got over the loss. Her second child, John Michael, was born on 18 September 1948.\n\nShe was tested for the prime female role in KÃ¶nig der Toreros (1941) opposite Tyrone Power but lost the part because her dancing skills were below par. Rita Hayworth won the role and Lynn was cast as Tyrone's sister instead.\n\nHer stage name was derived from the names of stage legend Lynn Fontanne and author J.M. Barrie (without the second \"r\" and the \"e\").\n\nAccording to a 1987 interview by Colin Briggs, published in \"Classic Images\", April 2016, she confirmed the date of her birth as 19 December 1919; she graduated from Beverly Hills grammar school in the spring of 1933.\n\nShe was a staunch Republican who gave much of her time and money to various conservative political causes. She also attended several Republican National Conventions, fund-raisers, galas, was an honorary member of the Republican National Committee, and was active in the campaigns of Wendell Willkie, Thomas E. Dewey, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan."
