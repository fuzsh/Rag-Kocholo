        "text": "In the 1950s and 1960s, former screen actress Mamie Van Doren (b. 1931) was, along with Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, the personification of glamour and beauty. While Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield died prematurely in the 1960s—the trio was known as ‘The Three M’s’—Ms. Van Doren’s career had skyrocketed as a leading lady in a number of juvenile delinquent rock ‘n’ roll pictures during the late 1950s.\n\nNow at age 86, the former actress, singer, model and sex symbol who was discovered by Howard Hughes when she was still a teenager, had a nightclub act and appeared on the stage after she was no longer in demand as a film actress. She wrote her autobiography “Playing the Field: My Story” (1987), and maintained her own website and a blog until a few years ago.\n\nThis interview was conducted in Los Angeles back in August 2000. As we sat down, she gracefully took the time to talk about Marilyn Monroe, what it was like working in Hollywood during the 1950s and not working there at all from the 1960s, the impact of B movies, and—first things first—how she entered the film business.\n\nMs. Van Doren, how did your career take off in the late 1940s?\n\nWhen I was fifteen, turning sixteen, my mom and I went to Palm Springs for a vacation, where we stayed in a little motel. They had a contest there for Miss Palm Springs, and they asked if I wanted to represent the motel. The contest was held at the Chi Chi Club on Palm Canyon Drive—and I won. Howard Hughes was out there in the audience, and later on, I got a call from RKO, the studio he owned, and that was the beginning for me. Jimmy McHugh, who had written a lot of famous songs, became my manager. He sent me to private schools and dramatic schools. At RKO, the roles I played were mostly bit parts, but I was working and getting a salary. I didn’t really have the background of acting, so Jimmy McHugh, who had been managing quite a few ladies, put me through schooling. I also appeared in about five plays, two of them were directed by Aaron Spelling. He was having a hard time back then, he didn’t have any money. In fact, I loaned him a hundred dollars at one time. We were all trying to make it in those days. Then I was discovered in the play “Come Back, Little Sheba” by a scout from Universal. I went over to the studio, and it is very funny, they were looking for a nightclub singer for a film called “Forbidden” [1953] with Tony Curtis. I got the job after director Rudolph Mathé heard me sing ‘I Can’t Give You Anything But Love, Baby.’ That was on Friday, and they were going to start shooting the following Monday, so I had just the weekend to learn the song ‘You Belong to Me,’ prerecorded by someone else, but I had to match my mouth to the record. I was learning the song, learning the mouth movements and everything, and it turned to be just fine. They offered me a seven-year contract, and I started at $260 a week. In those days, that was a lot. By then, I thought I was in.\n\nAnd you were?\n\nNo, not at all. Once you got in the studio, that was only the beginning, really. You had to work to keep your contract. They had sixty people under contract, all fighting for those roles. You had to get out and get publicity, perfect your diction; it was like going to school. Unlike other studios, Universal had a talent department. They would teach you, and the training you got was incredible. Then you’d go to the set, you’d watch Joan Crawford or James Stewart work, you’d learn how to walk in front of the camera, etc. I was tested for my first role with Tony Curtis, “The All-American” [1953], and the next one was “Yankee Pasha” [1954] with Jeff Chandler. You had to fight for every role. The film industry was very male-oriented; there were no women with any power. So as a young woman, I was there pretty much on my own and had to find my own way. But I did one movie after another, I was out there the whole time, later on also doing publicity and dating stars of the top studios, and that’s how you became known. And I met Ray Anthony, a very popular bandleader, and I got pregnant, but I couldn’t hide it after the fourth month, so we got married. The studio wasn’t too happy with that: a sex symbol wasn’t supposed to get married and have babies.\n\nHow would you describe yourself, looking back to your early years as an actress?\n\nI was really pre-feminist. I never really did the things most women did. When I got my contract, I knew I would never give in to something I didn’t want to do. Now, it’s like I’m post-feminist—I fought the system before anyone else did. Hollywood was very conservative back then, and when Ronald Reagan was President of the Screen Actors Guild [1947-52], Hollywood was super conservative. But I continued on and did some movies that today are more popular than some of the big A movies. Albert Zugsmith produced some of my movies, like “The Beat Generation” [1959] which had to do with the hippies at the end of the 1950s, or “High School Confidential!” [1958] at MGM—those movies were all ahead of their time, and were not given the approval of the Legion of Decency, which was something that had to be given by the Catholic Church. They sort of blacklisted me and told people not to see any of my movies; it was really quite bad. I was blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1960s to the point that I couldn’t even get anybody to raise any money for my movies. I was considered too sexy—I guess that’s what you should call it, I don’t know what it was—and whatever I had, I had to cover myself from my neck down, but that still didn’t help me any further. I just had a name that was very hard to sell.\n\nLater on, you went to Vietnam to entertain the troops. What impact did this have on you?\n\nWell, you know, Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, Jayne Mansfield passed away five years later—both in their mid-thirties—and that was just a very, very bad thing. Hollywood didn’t want to be reminded of blondes at that time, which was also one of the reasons why they didn’t want me anymore. It was a very difficult time in my life; I really had to hang on. So my son and I moved to Orange County, and we’ve lived here ever since. I simply had to get away from Hollywood, especially since I couldn’t get a job. Then I was asked to go to Vietnam—at a time when everybody was afraid to go over there—and I decided to go. I took a big insurance policy out for my son, my mother, and my father, and I just went over there. I really risked my life, but what changed my entire life was going over there and seeing that war: seeing all these wounded and sick kids who were trying to hang on to their life, while I thought I was going through a difficult time in my life. Now, when I look back at it, I just can’t believe I did that. It’s hard to describe how I felt and what was going on in my mind. When I came back, I was invited to the White House—I was Henry Kissinger’s date at the time. He was a peacemaker, trying to bring Hanoi and Washington closer together in Paris.\n\nBut your career was basically over?\n\nI couldn’t get any screen roles. I was not in that genre of movie stars at that time, and they also had new actresses coming up. Americans are also different from Europeans. Here it is ‘hot and cold’: one year, you’re popular, and the next year nobody hears from you. It’s the same with rock stars. They don’t stay behind their people, unlike in Europe where they stayed behind Brigitte Bardot, for example—actresses over there have a following.\n\nIs there anyone you would call your mentor?\n\nMae West was, in many ways. She was the one who went to jail for having the word ‘sex’ in a show she did in New York, she was the one who fought an entire system, and when she came to Hollywood, she opened the door for a lot of people. Then there was Jean Harlow—she was more a glamorous type—and then Marilyn came along in the 1950s. She really opened the door for me. When I got my contract at Universal, I was their answer to Marilyn Monroe. They made my hair platinum, and they gave me a lot of sexy roles—dumb roles, actually. The studio didn’t really know how to groom a female star because they only had male stars—Rock Hudson, Jeff Chandler, Tony Curtis. So they didn’t know what to do with a well-endowed blonde, except giving her dumb roles.\n\nHow well did you know Marilyn Monroe?\n\nI knew her since I was twelve years old when I lived behind the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. During the war years, when I was about twelve, I always went to the swimming pool, I used to go there all the time, sneak in the back and swim there. Marilyn was with a modeling agency, and one day, they were there taking pictures of her. Once I got in the way when they were taking a shot of her, and the photographer got mad. So he said, ‘Get out of the way, kid,’ but she thought I stayed at the hotel with my mom and dad. She said, ‘Well, you have no right to say that to her.’ That was our first meeting, and later, when we were both in pictures, we ran into each other all the time at parties. The last time I saw her was a few months before she died. I was doing a play in New York called “Wildcat.” It was late afternoon; I was having an early dinner in the Russian Tea Room, so I wouldn’t have a big stomach when I got on stage—I always ate early in the afternoon—she was sitting there too. Previously, I had done a movie in Italy, at the same time when she got the David di Donatello Award for her performance in “The Prince and the Showgirl” [1957] in Taormina, Sicily. That was the equivalent of the Academy Award. Since I was in Italy at the time, Marilyn had asked me if I could pick it up for her. So I did, and later, when I saw her again at the Russian Tea Room, I asked if she had received the statue. She had, but she wasn’t doing well then. She had not been living well, she had been drinking heavily that day, and she really looked disturbed. Marilyn was being used, she knew that and she was trying to cope with it. And the drugs made things much, much worse. It exaggerated everything. She was so vulnerable to the world, but what a sweet person she really was, lovable, compassionate—I have nothing but grace for Marilyn, and she should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award for “Bus Stop” [1956]. But in those days, they preferred to nominate the Bette Davis kind of stars. You know, talking about Marilyn Monroe is strange. To me, she’s a person; to most people, she’s an idea.\n\nWhat about Jayne Mansfield?\n\nJayne Mansfield became popular through a New York play that was written for me, called “Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?” I had turned it down because it was a satire on Marilyn, and I didn’t want to be compared to her anymore. So it was then given to an unknown, named Jayne Mansfield. Whether she would have become famous otherwise, I don’t know. In films, she played mostly character roles, while Marilyn did more sophisticated movies, and I did several rock ‘n’ roll movies. The three of us were often compared, maybe because we had blonde hair, but all three of us were very different.\n\nYou will always be associated with your rock ‘n’ roll movies, I suppose? How instrumental was producer Albert Zugsmith in this particular era of your career?\n\nI met Zuggy at Universal, he was one of the producers on the lot, and he wanted me in “Star In the Dust” [1956], a Western with John Agar. They said I wasn’t the type for it, so they put a dark blonde wig on me. They wanted me to look like Grace Kelly with breasts. I got that role, and after I left Universal, he left too and went to MGM, where he got a four-picture contract. That’s where I did movies like “The Beat Generation,” “Girls Town,” and “The Big Operator” [all 1959]. At Warner Brothers, I worked with Howard W. Koch on two movies, “Born Reckless” [1958] and “Untamed Youth” [1957], still one of the most famous and most popular of today when it comes to rock ‘n’ roll. I was the first girl to do rock ‘n’ roll on the silver screen—they didn’t even know what rock ‘n’ roll was. Nobody had ever seen a woman do it. So they brought a choreographer in to teach me the steps, but I said, ‘You don’t learn rock ‘n’ roll, it must come from inside!’\n\n“Untamed Youth” (1957, trailer)\n\nThe films you mention now were quite the opposite of the romantic comedy “Teacher’s Pet” [1958] which you made with Clark Gable and Doris Day. How did you get cast for that movie?\n\nI was at the commissary, and Clark Gable saw me. Later that day, I got a call from my agent; he told me that Gable had seen me, and wanted me in his movie. So they sent me the script, but my role of Peggy DeFore, a stripper, was much larger in the script than what it was in the movie, you know. They cut a lot of it out.\n\n“Teacher’s Pet” is also one of the few major features—’A movies’—that you appeared in, isn’t it? What’s in your opinion the difference between A and B movies?\n\nYou knew, in those days, there were hardly any women who headlined movies. Men always had first billing, unless it was a Joan Crawford or Bette Davis movie. But I starred in most of my so-called B movies. Those movies didn’t have a leading man with a name, and that’s why they were called B movies. It was hard for a man to want somebody like me to play opposite. Men always wanted something that will make them look better—except Gable; he was different. He had played with Jean Harlow, Vivien Leigh, Marilyn Monroe; he never felt that somebody would upstage him. He was one hell of a man. When Marilyn did a movie, she usually had a male over her. She should have been starring in her movies. The only one she really starred in, was “Bus Stop” [1956]. That was not a B movie, but—give me a break—“The Misfits” [1961] wasn’t a B movie because Clark Gable was in it. B movies were always more fun for me, and I think it’s unfair to say that I made B movies simply because I was in them. In my opinion, none of my movies were B movies; they were just as A as you could get. Because I didn’t have a big male lead opposite of me, I don’t think that should put any of those movies in another category. I knew I made a lot of money for the people who backed my movies; they put their money in, and they always got it back. They made more money than those big movies, like the “Ma and Pa Kettle” and “Frances the Talking Mule” series which kept Universal’s payroll going. I have done A movies too, but I preferred doing B movies—if that’s what people want to call them, then so be it. Elvis Presley did B movies; Jack Nicholson did B movies,… So when I am referred to as ‘The Queen of the B Movies,’ I leave that to the person who reads it. If I could become popular and people could see that we were ahead of our time, then that’s great for me. Take “Running Wild” [1955], “Untamed Youth” [1957], or “The Beat Generation” [1959], all those movies we did, I think they’re great. And you have to remember we had wonderful stars in our pictures, people like Louis Armstrong, Eddie Cochran, Paul Anka—I mean, are those B people? Being ahead of our time was like, ‘Oh, you don’t dare to do this.’ Or, ‘Well, you can’t do that.’ So you’re fighting the system all the time, and that’s what I did all those years.\n\nMamie Van Doren singing ‘The Girl Who Invented Rock and Roll’ in “Teacher’s Pet,” directed by George Seaton, and written by Fay and Michael Kanin\n\nIs there anything you regret, wrong decisions you might have made, for example?\n\nNo, not really. You know, the one thing that was so great in those days was that a woman named Brigitte Bardot came along with “Et Dieu créa la femme” [1956, a.k.a. “And God Created Woman”]. Over here, we were fighting censorship in the 1950s and 1960s when you couldn’t even show you had a bust. We had to cover everything, and when Bardot’s movie was released in an art house in Los Angeles, my God, people were lining up all the way down Wilshire Boulevard to see it. I also stood in line, and I thought, ‘Why can’t I do that?’\n\nDid you ever hope to make a come-back after staying away from the Hollywood limelight for such a long time?\n\nAfter Vietnam, I went to the White House in 1973, the following year, I met my husband-to-be [Thomas Dixon], and then I didn’t go back to Hollywood for the next eighteen years. I was invited to come up once in a while, but I would never go because I thought nobody would remember me. About eight or nine years ago, a personal friend of mine, Skip E. Lowell, who has a cable show called “Skip E. Low Looks at Hollywood,” asked me to go to a Hollywood party. I thought it would be embarrassing; people might not even know who I am. My husband urged me to go, so I wore a very simple black dress, and when I got out of the car, people still recognized me. I realized that they still knew me. I had also written my autobiography “Playing the Field” a few years before. At first, when I wrote it, I thought, ‘My God, nobody is going to buy that book.’ But when it was published, I was invited on all the top shows, “Today” two mornings in a row, “Larry King” twice, etc., so it really took off, and the book did well considering I had been away for so many years. So I started going back to Hollywood. I wrote my book back then on a small Apple when you had to save every chapter, otherwise, it would get lost. I have been familiar with computers since 1985, and recently, I celebrated the second anniversary of my website [not available anymore]. I started that not to make money, but I wanted people to know me through my own eyes instead of through someone writing about me. My husband and I started this whole thing.\n\nDo you maybe have one more final thought you’d like to share before we say goodbye?\n\nI have always been very open about my life; I never felt I had anything to hide. I have never been in any scandal; I always kept away from scandals, I have a sense of knowing when to get out of it and when not to, and I have never done anything to hurt anyone. So now I’m just glad to be waltzing around and enjoy my life more than I ever have.\n\nAnd health-wise? Because you’re still in great shape.\n\nDon’t smoke, don’t drink, don’t do drugs, and get enough sleep. A healthy lifestyle will increase your lifespan considerably.\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nAugust 2000\n\nFILMS\n\nJET PILOT (1949, release delayed until 1957) DIR Josef von Sternberg PROD – SCR Jules Furthman CAM Philip G.
