        "text": "A Los Angeles U.S. District judge barred him from selling the replacement Juvenile Oscar Judy Garland received for \"The Wizard of Oz.\" He was also ordered to pay nearly $60,000 to The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to end their second lawsuit against him for repeatedly trying to sell the statuette. (September 2002)\n\nWhile reviving her career at the London Palladium and the Palace Theatre in the early 1950s, it was his idea to have wife Judy Garland come down to the edge of the stage and sing \"Over the Rainbow\" for dramatic effect.\n\nWhatever bad things happened, you don't fall out of love with somebody like her. All I know is that, if anyone tried to save a woman who was breaking apart, I did. I know that I did the best I could do, and it still wasn't enough. -- following Garland's accidental drug death in 1969\n\nI loved her and didn't want to see her kicked around. If MGM couldn't handle her, that was their problem. But she was so incredibly talented that I knew she could land on her feet if she had some help. So what if the movies didn't want her? She could always sing. I wasn't going to let her fail. -- referring to his part in resurrecting Garland's career via the concert circuit\n\nWhen we got married in the early '50s, Judy was still very beautiful. She was only 5-foot tall -- just a shrimp of a girl, really -- but she had a very sensuous body, and up close, her skin was like porcelain, pure white. I was crazy about her. She had incredibly kissable lips. -- referring to ex-wife Judy Garland"
