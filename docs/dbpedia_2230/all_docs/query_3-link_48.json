        "text": "TARPON SPRINGS, Fla., Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The mother of Deborah Jeane Palfrey, the so-called \"D.C. Madam,\" says photographs of her daughter's suicide in Tarpon Springs, Fla., should not be released.\n\nBlanche Palfrey has filed a lawsuit in Pinellas County Circuit Court as part of her attempt to block the release of the crime scene photos taken following Palfrey's May 1 suicide, the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times said Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe surviving Palfrey's attorney, Serbo Simeoni, alleges in the Florida lawsuit that the Tarpon Springs Police Department photos are \"inappropriate, unacceptable and personally harmful\" to the elderly woman.\n\nThe Times said prior to her death, the \"D.C. Madam\" was facing a maximum prison sentence of eight years after being convicted of money laundering and racketeering while operating a prostitution service."
