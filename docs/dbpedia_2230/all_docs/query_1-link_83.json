        "text": "The Vallejo home from which “D.C. Madam” Deborah Jeane Palfrey ran her infamous escort service likely will sell for nearly a half-million dollars less than its original 2007 asking price.\n\nA federal judge recently approved the sale of Palfrey’s two-bedroom Capitol Street historic home, with the money to be put into escrow, since Palfrey’s assets remain frozen as they move through probate. Palfrey hanged herself at age 52, in a shed at her mother’s Florida home two weeks after her May 2008 conviction for running a prostitution service that catered to members of Washington’s political elite.\n\nRecords show Palfrey’s two-story, 1865 Greco-Italinate-style home was listed in May 2007 for $748,500. Its last listing was $290,940.\n\n“She originally wanted $1 million for it in 2006, but that was way, way too much,” local Realtor Corrine Oakes said.\n\nThough the home was beautifully restored, even winning a city award for best restored house in 2006, other, larger historic homes were selling for significantly less than what Palfrey wanted, Oakes said. She said she told Palfrey at the time that a price of about $550,000 was more reasonable.\n\n“She wasn’t very pleased with that,” Oakes said. “Obviously, she’d poured her heart and soul into that place and the fact that it was a historic home carried a lot of weight with her. And she did a beautiful job redoing it.”\n\nThe current asking price is likely about right, Oakes said, adding the home’s been on the market for a whopping 663 days.\n\nKatherine Schuster of Vacaville’s Schuster Real Estate is the property’s listing agent, and represents Palfrey’s mother, Blanche Palfrey. Schuster said a couple of people are already looking at the house. While its historic significance is a draw, its most recent infamy doesn’t seem to be generating interest, she added.\n\n“All proceeds from the sale of the house will go to The Innocence Project. That’s what she wanted to do,” Schuster said. The organization is dedicated to legally freeing those believed wrongly convicted of serious crimes. Any sale is contingent upon court approval of all terms and conditions, Schuster said.\n\nPalfrey’s extreme privacy requirements for showing the property likely was another reason the home failed to sell while Palfrey was alive, Oakes said. Palfrey had seemed a recluse to her Vallejo neighbors, avoiding contact with locals while running the Washington, D.C. prostitution ring.\n\n“Once the news broke about her, all that made sense,” Oakes said.\n\nPalfrey’s only connection to Vallejo was the house she bought here after serving 18 months in prison for a 1991 conviction for operating a prostitution business in California.\n\nPalfrey told the Times-Herald in an interview following her 2007 arrest, that she left San Diego in 1991, after her prison stint, in search of affordable housing.\n\n“I wanted to buy a pretty, old historical home and remodel it or restore it,” she said at the time. “I have no ties whatsoever to Vallejo. I didn’t go to school here … I never worked in the area.”\n\nPalfrey, who lived in Vallejo for 16 years, spent two years remodeling the home — Vallejo’s landmark No. 16 — one of only 10 residential landmarks in town.\n\nIn 2007, a federal grand jury indicted her on racketeering and money-laundering charges stemming from the operation of Pamela Martin and Associates escort service, which she operated through the 1990s with more than 100 college-educated escorts, generating about $2 million in income.\n\nOver the years, she’d put her Vallejo house on the market several times, the last time in 2007, when she hoped to move to Germany after getting her confiscated passport back.\n\nContact staff writer Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at (707) 553-6824 or RachelZ@thnewsnet.com."
