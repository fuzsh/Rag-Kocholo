        "text": "Clearwater\n\nA judge ordered Friday that crime scene photographs taken by police during the suicide investigation of Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also known as the D.C. Madam, are public - to an extent.\n\nPalfrey's mother, Blanche Palfrey, 76, had requested the court prohibit the release of photos taken by Tarpon Springs police in the hours immediately after her daughter's death by hanging.\n\nSixth Circuit Judge Linda Allan said the public could view the photos, but she prohibited their duplication or publication.\n\nAllan said the order struck a balance between the public's right to know and Blanche Palfrey's right to privacy.\n\nThe younger Palfrey, 52, committed suicide May 1 in a shed outside her mother's home. Palfrey had been convicted two weeks earlier of racketeering and money laundering while running a prostitution service.\n\nThe order is a temporary injunction that could be revisited , Allan said.\n\nAttorney Tom Reynolds, representing the St. Petersburg Times, which had requested access to the photos, said he didn't plan to appeal the motion at this time."
