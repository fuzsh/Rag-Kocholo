        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. David Vitter, R-La., is scheduled to be called as a witness for the defense in the so-called \"D.C. Madam\" trial that began this morning in federal court, the woman's attorney told jurors.\n\nVitter is among six witnesses attorney Preston Burton told potential jurors he planned to call during the racketeering and money-laundering trial of Deborah Jeane Palfrey, who ran an escort service for 13 years in the nation's capital. Prosecutors say that Palfrey's $300 per hour service was a front for prostitution. Vitter has not been charged. His phone number showed up several times in Palfrey's phone records between 1999 and 2001 when he was a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nVitter has refused to discuss his involvement with the escort service except to say last July that he had committed a \"very serious sin.\" Vitter issued a statement Friday saying \"how sorry I am to have hurt the people I love so deeply, starting with my family and certainly including the people of Louisiana.\"\n\nOn Friday, Vitter's attorney sought to quash a subpoena but was denied by U.S. District Judge James Robertson. The attorney, Henry Asbill, indicated that his client planned to refuse to answer questions by invoking his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nAlso named as a defense witness was former Deputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias. Another alleged client of the escort service, Harlan Ullman, a military analyst who coined the term \"shock and awe\" was listed as a witness for the prosecution along with more than a dozen women who worked as escorts and have been granted immunity from criminal prosecution."
