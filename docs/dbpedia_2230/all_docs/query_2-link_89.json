Palfrey had big plans to revitalize her hometown of Charleroi that took shape after she launched a social networking Web site for graduates of her high school.\n\tPalfrey’s Internet site, founded in 2002, attracted numerous fans, including a Washington County judge, who used it to reconnect with their old classmates. She drew even more interest after being profiled last year in a Mon Valley newspaper about her lofty goals to return Charleroi to its pristine roots.\n\tNow, people in her hometown have been distancing themselves from Palfrey, shocked by news of her March 1 indictment on accusations she ran a prostitution ring catering to the Washington, D.C., area.\n\t“I was excited about this Web site thing she set up because it looked like a good vehicle for the community where I grew up and my parents still live, Charleroi,” said Washington County Judge Mark Mascara, who attended Charleroi Area High School in the 1970s with Palfrey. “Once I read the indictment, my connection to the Web site ended.”\n\tMost of the people who had registered to Palfrey’s site, <a href=\"http://www.charleroipahsalumni.org\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.charleroipahsalumni.org</a>, severed their ties to it after she became known as the “D.C. madam” in news articles and blogs that have flooded the Internet.\n\tPalfrey, 50, of Vallejo, Calif., is facing federal racketeering charges that she made nearly $2 million from prostitution-related activities over 13 years. She reportedly hired young college-educated women, who charged men in the D.C. area between $275 and $300 for sex. The prostitutes turned over half of the income to Palfrey in money orders, the indictment indicates.\n\tPalfrey has considered selling 46 pounds of her telephone records to raise money for her legal defense, according to another Web site she created to tell her side of the case. \n\tShe claims she is innocent, that she operated a “legal escort service” and paid the women incomes that were reported to the IRS.
