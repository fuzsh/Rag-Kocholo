        "text": "When I learned that Deborah Jeane Palfrey, the infamous D.C. Madam, was found hanging in a shed, my first thought was: Could she have been murdered?\n\nThere is so much room for speculation!\n\nPalfrey would not have been sentenced till July and her mother said that she did not seem suicidal, so this seems like a strange time to off herself. But that is beside the point. What I want to know is: How can you make every minute detail of a murder scene look like the site of a suicide?\n\nIn this case, which may have been a legitimate suicide, the victim left several notes. To create a scene like that, you couldn't just force her head into a noose. You would need to coerce her, possibly by threatening her family and explaining that she would be killed one way or another within the span of hours.\n\nEven if there wasn't a suicide note, making it look like an intentional act of self-destruction would be tricky. When you try to drown someone, or hang them, they usually fight back. Medical examiners would notice the scratches and bruises. Drugs might take some fight out of the victim, but they would show up in a toxicology screen.\n\n__What do you think of the Palfrey case? How would you make a murder look like suicide?\n\n__\n\nPhoto: MacAllenBrothers / flickr\n\nThe Race for Space-Based Solar Power\n\nOnce a sci-fi staple, the ability to beam solar power from space now seems closer than ever—but a lot of work remains.\n\nCutting-Edge Technology Could Massively Reduce the Amount of Energy Used for Air Conditioning\n\nRoughly 10 percent of the world’s energy is used for cooling, with much of the necessary electricity generated by fossil fuels.
