        "text": "9/11 Conspiracy Connection To DC Madam Murder\n\nPalfrey told former NSA official that call girls had picked up information concerning foreknowledge of attacks\n\nPaul Joseph Watson\n\nMonday, May 5, 2008\n\n|\n\nFormer NSA analyst and Navy intelligence officer Wayne Madsen tells the The Alex Jones Show that one of the key motives behind the DC Madam's murder may have been the information her call girls picked up from Washington's top brass concerning foreknowledge and government complicity in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMadsen also connected another suspicious death - that of former CIA agent Roland Carnaby who was gunned down by Houston police last week - to another individual who was involved in both the 9/11 cover-up and the D.C. Madam scandal, disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\nNoting that Palfrey and her defense team had tried to invoke the Classified Information Procedures Act in the U.S. District Court in Washington, which is only used when classified information or the names of people who are intelligence officers needs to be discussed, Madsen said Palfrey, \"Had information which could have a bearing on the 9/11 attacks that some of her employees may have picked up information beforehand that would have been very useful to the 9/11 investigation.\"\n\nMadsen added that most of Palfrey's call girls had been active around the area of McLean Virginia, which is where the CIA and other intelligence agencies are based and where Dick Cheney lived at the time.\n\nHost Alex Jones recalled that during interviews Palfrey had told him that her escort service was in fact being used as an intelligence operation to gather intelligence on individuals who used the service, particularly those connected to the military.\n\nMadsen, who spoke personally to Palfrey on numerous occasions, recalls one conversation at dinner about a month a go with Palfrey and her asset forfeiture lawyer where Palfrey told him, 'I have information that would have been of great interest to the 9/11 Commission - there's information that they have (her call girls) that would have been very important for the 9/11 Commission to know having to do with intelligence they picked up about 9/11 before it happened'.\n\nThe former NSA official noted that some of Palfrey's call girls were being chauffeured by Sherlington Limousines to poker parties attended by former CIA director and co-chair of the Joint 9/11 Intelligence Inquiry Porter Goss. One of the reasons cited for Goss' abrupt resignation in May 2006 was his alleged involvement in a prostitution scandal where lobbyists were holding parties for GOP lawmakers that featured hookers and gambling at the Watergate Hotel in D.C.\n\nOn the morning of 9/11, Goss was having breakfast with the head of Pakistanâ€™s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) General Mahmoud Ahmad, the man who ordered a wire transfer of $100,000 to alleged lead hijacker Mohammed Atta.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey.\n\nIn addition, Madsen pointed out that Jack Abramoff, who was also connected to the DC Madam scandal, allowed at least two of the 9/11 hijackers to use one of his casino boats in the days before 9/11, and this is what Palfrey was probably referring to when she spoke about her call girls picking up information about 9/11 before it happened.\n\n\"There's the link, when you've got Abramoff and you had two of those hijackers on his casino boat a few days before 9/11 - I just wonder if that's what Jeane was talking about,\" said Madsen, \"Because now I'm looking at this crazy incident in Houston with Roland Carnaby, a retired CIA guy who was still contracted to the CIA, being gunned down in broad daylight by the Houston police department - now I've been told by Agency sources in Houston that one of the people he was looking at was Abramhoff and the casino boats - so here you've got two people in the same week, looks like they were both assassinated in broad daylight,\" he concluded.\n\nMany readers will recall that Newsweek reported that military brass in Washington received a warning the night before the 9/11 attacks which led to a September 11 flight being cancelled. \"NEWSWEEK has learned that while U.S. intelligence received no specific warning, the state of alert had been high during the past two weeks, and a particularly urgent warning may have been received the night before the attacks, causing some top Pentagon brass to cancel a trip. Why that same information was not available to the 266 people who died aboard the four hijacked commercial aircraft may become a hot topic on the Hill,\" according to the September 13 2001 issue.\n\nThe connection to 9/11 is tantalizing and provides a key motive for why numerous power brokers would have wanted Palfrey to be shut up for good before she had the opportunity to release information in court that her call girls picked up about 9/11 pointing to foreknowledge and government complicity in the attacks.\n\nOverwhelming Evidence Points To Murder Of DC Madam\n\n\"She insinuated that there is a contract out for her and I fully believe they succeeded,\" says Condo manager\n\nPaul Joseph Watson\n\nSaturday, May 3, 2008\n\nEvidence is stacking up to suggest that the alleged \"suicide\" of DC Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey was in fact a calculated murder, as the manager of Palfrey's Florida Condo reveals that Palfrey was not suicidal when he spoke to her Monday and told him of her fears about a contract being out on her life.\n\nThe new testimony is backed up by at least four other recorded public statements on behalf of Palfrey attesting to the fact that she would never commit suicide and if she was found dead to immediately suspect murder.\n\nDespite these on-the-record statements, the majority of the corporate media has ignored each one and instead given credence to the unverified claim of a professional conspiracy debunker who has been caught fabricating statements in the past.\n\nThe building manager of Park Lake Towers in Orlando, where Palfrey owned a condo, told WESH 2 news channel that he spoke to Palfrey on Monday as she was packing to leave for her mother's house and she did not seem upset or suicidal.\n\n\"Jean Palfrey was a class act. She wore very good clothes. She was well educated. Her way out of this world certainly would not have been in an aluminum shed attached to a mobile home in Tarpon Springs, Florida,\" said the manager, who did not want to be named.\n\nThe manager said that Palfrey had told him of her fears that a contract hit was out on her life.\n\n\"She insinuated that there is a contract out for her and I fully believe they succeeded,\" he stated.\n\nAccording to the manger, Palfrey left for her mother's house with some suitcases and a box.\n\n\"She had one white paper file box that she told me had some important paper with her and then she just kind of raised her eyebrows like you're supposed to think oh yeah, that's all the information that she had on her business in Washington,\" her building manager said.\n\nIf Palfrey was planning to commit suicide just three days later then why did she leave with several suitcases and a box of files?\n\nAccording to an AP report, \"Blanche Palfrey (her mother) had no sign that her daughter was suicidal, and there was no immediate indication that alcohol or drugs were involved, police Capt. Jeffrey Young said,\" .\n\nOn at least four previous occasions, both in the past and more recently, Palfrey publicly stated that she would never commit suicide.\n\nTwice on The Alex Jones Show, the most recent example being less than two months ago, Palfrey made clear her intention never to kill herself (Click here for MP3).\n\n\"No I'm not planning to commit suicide,\" Palfrey told The Alex Jones Show on her last appearance in March, \"I'm planning on going into court and defending myself vigorously and exposing the government,\" she said.\n\n\"Not to be concerned, I have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me....and I'm not planning to commit suicide either,\" said Palfrey on a separate occasion.\n\nAlex Jones also talked directly to Palfrey during show breaks and she re-stated her intention never to commit suicide and made it clear that if she was found dead to consider it murder. GCN Live radio board operators are also witnesses to these statements.\n\nThough never confirmed directly, Palfrey strongly insinuated that both Dick Cheney and John McCain were possibly involved in the DC Madam scandal, and this could have been one of the primary reasons why she was murdered.\n\nDuring a May 2007 interview with Carol Joynt, host of the Q&amp;A Cafe interview series, during a discussion about the alleged suicide of Palfrey's former call girl Brandy Britton, Palfrey stated, \"I don't want to be like her. I don't want to end up like her.\"\n\nDuring another appearance on The Alex Jones Show, Palfrey said she thought it was possible that Britton's \"suicide\" was actually murder because none of Britton's loved ones considered her to be suicidal.\n\nPalfrey is on record as warning that any \"suicide\" would just be a cover-story for murder as far back as 1991.\n\n\"If taken into custody, my physical safety and most probably my very life would be jeopardized,\" she wrote in August 1991 following an attempt to bring her to trial, \"Rape, beating, maiming, disfigurement and more than likely murder disguised in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would await me,\" said Palfrey in a handwritten letter to the judge accusing the San Diego police vice squad of having a vendetta against her.\n\nDespite these four separate examples of Palfrey stating - on the record - that she would not commit suicide - the corporate media, within hours of the announcement of her death, immediately afforded credence to the claim of a \"friend,\" investigative journalist Dan Moldea, who said Palfrey had told him of her intention to commit suicide.\n\nMoldea has no tape, he has no other eyewitnesses, and he has been caught fabricating statements in the past, and yet the media took his words as gospel. In addition, if Moldea was aware of Palfrey's intention to kill herself then why, if he was her \"friend\" as he claims, didn't he try to stop her from doing so?\n\nThe numerous examples of Palfrey stating that she would never commit suicide in addition to her condo manager and her own mother stating that she was not suicidal clearly provide justification for an exhaustive police and FBI investigation to be undertaken. Despite these glaring factors, the police who discovered Palfrey's body immediately ruled that no foul play was involved and closed the book.\n\nThe knowledge that Palfrey had about members of Washington's elite being involved in and using her escort service for the purposes of hiring prostitutes would have been enough to end scores of careers and wreck the lives of countless influential power brokers. This alone, allied with Palfrey's on the record statements, demand an immediate and thorough investigation in an attempt to bring to justice the murderers of Deborah Jeane Palfrey.\n\nMadsen also connected another suspicious death - that of former CIA agent Roland Carnaby who was gunned down by Houston police last week - to another individual who was involved in both the 9/11 cover-up and the D.C. Madam scandal, disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff.\n\nApril 30, 2008, 8:36PM\n\nHPD: Carnaby flashed CIA card before deadly chase\n\nKilled man known to his friends as a federal intelligence officer\n\nBy MIKE TOLSON, LINDSAY WISE and MIKE GLENN\n\nCopyright 2008 Houston Chronicle\n\nThe man Houston police fatally shot after an hourlong chase Tuesday had shown a card identifying him as a CIA employee to officers who stopped him earlier for speeding, authorities said Wednesday.\n\n\"He (the officer) did not know what federal credentials looked like,\" said Capt. Steve Jett, with Houston Police Department's homicide division. \"They look authentic, but you can do a lot of things with a computer.\"\n\nOfficers shot and killed 52-year-old Roland Vincent Carnaby, saying they feared for their lives when he reached under the seat of his Jeep sport utility vehicle after the chase had ended and he'd gotten out of his car.\n\nThe shiny object that Carnaby was apparently reaching for was a personal assistant-cellular phone, Jett said Wednesday.\n\nOfficers found three weapons inside the Jeep after it was impounded. One pistol was under the passenger-side floor mat while a second was between the seats. A pistol-grip shotgun was on the floor board of the back seat.\n\n\"We believe they are all legal,\" Jett said. \"We have no reason to believe he didn't own them.\"\n\nHouston Police Chief Harold Hurtt also reiterated that he had no connection â€” personal or professional â€” with Carnaby.\n\n\"I didn't recall his name or realize who he was until I saw his photo\" on the news, Hurtt said.\n\nA photograph of the two men was taken at an HPD ball within the last year or so, Hurtt said.\n\n\"I've taken pictures with probably another thousand Houstonians in the last four years,\" Hurtt said.\n\nWho Carnaby was remains a mystery to many.\n\nHe held himself out as a federal intelligence agent but was sometimes cagey about his precise job and employer. At times he mentioned the Central Intelligence Agency or the Department of Homeland Security. He was the president of the local chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers, a legitimate national organization whose board contains luminaries such as former President George H.W. Bush. Friends said they have seen him in the company socially of local law enforcement officials and high-level CIA bureaucrats.\n\nCIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said that Carnaby was not employed by the agency.\n\n\"While we do not as a rule publicly deny or confirm employment, I will tell you in this case that Mr. Carnaby was not an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency,\" Gimigliano said. \"He was never a CIA officer.\"\n\nWife: He worked for CIA for 30 years\n\nSusan Carnaby said her husband has worked for the agency for 30 years.\n\nHe often travelled overseas, leaving for months at a time. If he was in Washington, he would tell her, but most of the time she had no idea where he had gone, she said. It was top secret, he told her.\n\n\"Just tried to keep myself busy as much as I can,\" she said Wednesday. \"Obviously he'd tell me who he worked for but he never could talk to me about the cases that he did. But that was for my own protection. I really didn't want to know.\"\n\nCarnaby described her husband as a patriot.\n\n\"He just loved his country,\" she said. \"I think that's his main motivation. He's just very devoted to it and he enjoyed what he did. I guess it made him feel important.\"\n\nThe last time she saw him was in March, she said. They kept in touch regularly by e-mail and phone.\n\nThat government officials deny her husband worked for the CIA or the FBI doesn't surprise her.\n\n\"No, because why would they even admit it?\" she said. \"How many cases could that blow? I think that's not their policy to make comments on that type of thing. Roland always told me that if anything ever happened to him don't expect anyone to stand up and say that's what he did for a living. They keep these things undercover for a reason.\"\n\nCar dealer's close friend\n\nCar dealer Alan Helfman met Carnaby more than a decade ago when \"a mutual friend high in law enforcement\" brought him by the dealership. \"He bought eight or nine cars from me over the years,\" Helfman said.\n\nCarnaby told Helfman he was a federal officer who worked in intelligence. The two men struck up a close friendship.\n\n\"He was always teasing me about being a reserve constable,\" said Helfman, who volunteers for Harris County Precinct 7.\n\nFriends insist Carnaby was very much who he said he was, even if he was less than specific about his duties. One recalled a recent party in Washington that they both attended for retired intelligence agents.\n\n'A blank page'\n\n\"Most of what he does is so classified that regular homicide (detectives) will come up with a blank page and then a question about why you are asking,\" said Fred Platt, the vice president of the local chapter of intelligence agents. \"He's here because of homeland security. The port and the airport. He knows everybody on the command staff of every agency.\"\n\nLocal law enforcement officials, however, say they don't know him, including Hurtt and Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas. The local FBI office also claims to have no knowledge of him.\n\nCarnaby traveled frequently for work, Helfman said, but whenever he was in Houston, he visited the dealership on a daily basis. Helfman said Carnaby spoke seven languages and always carried an arsenal of weapons, including several guns and a knife.\n\n\"He was always showing me his knife tricks,\" he said. \"He was real good at karate, too.\"\n\nCarnaby was tight-lipped about his work and his private life, and Helfman said he didn't question him.\n\n\"His entire life has always been clandestine. His girlfriends didn't even know what he was doing,\" Helfman said.\n\nEven mundane details of Carnaby's life were tinged with mystery. His address listed with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles is a private mailbox at a UPS Store near downtown. The address at which he registered his Jeep Commander was a different UPS Store in Pearland.\n\nWhatever his real story, Carnaby's life came to an end about 11 a.m. Tuesday after police forced his vehicle to a stop. He didn't acknowledge the officers who encircled him with guns drawn. And he \"refused to put his hands where the officers could see him,\" said Houston Police Sgt. John Chomiak.\n\n\"The driver refused to comply, talk or roll down the window,\" Chomiak said.\n\nHe opened the driver's side door only after one of the officers smashed the passenger-side window, police said.\n\n\"He stepped out of his vehicle, turned around and reached under the seat,\" Chomiak said.\n\nWhen he did, two officers each fired one time, authorities said. The officers were identified by police officials as HPD Sgt. A.J. Washington and officer C.A. Foster. Carnaby was later pronounced dead at Ben Taub Hospital.\n\nThe incident lasted most of an hour. It began with a routine traffic stop when Carnaby was pulled over for speeding along Texas 288 near Orem. Carnaby raced away after the officers learned he had a license to carry a concealed weapon, police said.\n\n120-mph chase\n\nWith the officers in close pursuit, the Jeep raced north along the South Freeway, with speeds reaching 120 mph toward downtown Houston before heading west on the Katy Freeway. Carnaby then headed south along the West Loop, exiting at Woodway where the chase finally came to an end.\n\nHarris County medical examiners said the autopsy probably would be performed Wednesday.\n\nWashington, a 22-year HPD veteran, and Foster, who has been on the force for about 15 years, later told investigators they fired because they were in fear for their safety, police said.\n\nPolice said the shooting was apparently captured by the dashboard cameras of the HPD patrol cars.\n\nCarnaby slumped to the ground after the officers began firing. He was motionless when they placed him in handcuffs.\n\n'This doesn't smell right'\n\nThe frontage road was closed for several hours Tuesday as investigators questioned the officers behind long lines of crime scene tape.\n\n\"What's going on?\" a passing motorist shouted out as he crawled along the clogged West Loop.\n\nThat's the question his friends want answered. They say Carnaby had no reason to run or disobey police.\n\nPlatt said he had dined with Carnaby both Saturday and Sunday and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Carnaby was engaged to be married, he said, and led a happy life.\n\n\"I can't fathom any reason why he would be running from the police because he is the police,\" Platt said. \"This doesn't make any sense. I can't understand him running or why they opened up on him. This doesn't smell right.\"\n\nStaff reporter Cindy George contributed to this report.\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]"
