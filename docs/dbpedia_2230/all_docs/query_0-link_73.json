        "text": "Palfrey was furious when, after 13 years, the federal authorities suddenly decided that what she was doing was illegal. She swore that all she had done was run an escort agency. The women who worked for her, she said, were educated and refined and, for about $US300 ($360) an hour, would visit men in their homes or hotel rooms for the purpose of administering an \"erotic massage\".\n\n\"All the women signed contracts to the effect that they were providing only erotic services and not sex,\" she says. \"Yes, they might have been naked, but as long as the men remained on their stomachs, no offence was being committed.\"\n\nThe trouble with this defence, of course, was that it was so improbable. So in order to prove that Palfrey offered non-sexual services, Sibley decided that the only way to get witnesses to come forward to testify to that fact was to release the phone records of clients. To ABC News.\n\nWhen some of these clients were, inevitably, fingered by ABC, they would then be asked to testify in court that all they received from the women supplied by Palfrey was a massage.\n\nSibley was outraged, he said, by suggestions that this was really a form of blackmail signalling to the federal authorities that if they persisted with the charges against Palfrey, she would be forced to reveal the names of some of her more illustrious clients.\n\nSome of these men, Sibley said at a news conference, with Palfrey nodding in agreement, held senior government positions and included civilian and uniformed officers at the Pentagon.\n\n\"We're looking for witnesses,\" he said. \"If there's a bank robbery, you want to see who's at the scene of the crime so they can testify to the identity of the bank robbers. It's no different.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Palfrey's website - of course she has a website - she has posted part of her phone bill. The Washington Post says some numbers were for the Pentagon and the nearby five-star Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City.\n\nSibley says girls were regularly sent to the Ritz Carlton on \"dates\".\n\nNo wonder Palfrey is attracting attention. Her sense of injustice, that she faces jail while the men who used her services can remain anonymous and free to continue their successful careers, is genuine and affecting.\n\nPalfrey's life story has been the subject of a number of \"investigative\" specials in a number of newspapers and TV current affairs programs. Even The Washington Post has given her what some critics say is an inordinate amount of coverage.\n\nPalfrey, 50, single, who is a law school dropout, is not the world's most successful madam. Although Pamela Martin & Associates, her escort service, has been in business for 13 years and has, Palfrey says, employed only \"high-class women with college degrees or better\", federal authorities concede she never made more than $100,000 a year - and that only in the \"really good years\".\n\nPalfrey says that while her success has been modest, some of the women who have worked for her escort service have gone on to achieve great success in business and government. She is proud of these women, she says.\n\nUnlike Palfrey's, Randall Tobias's life had until now been an American success story. He was a highly regarded wealthy chief executive of a big US drug company when George Bush, in 2003, appointed him to run the Administration's $15 billion global AIDS program. Tobias had no previous experience for this task, but he was a safe conservative, a supporter of the Administration's position of funding AIDS programs focused on abstinence.\n\nLast year Bush promoted Tobias, appointing him deputy secretary of state and putting him in charge of all US foreign aid programs. At 64, Tobias, married with grown-up children, was a highly respected figure in conservative circles, even if he was little known outside Washington.\n\nHe is certainly well known outside Washington now. Just over a week ago he was contacted by federal authorities and asked if he had ever used Palfrey's escort service. Soon after, he was contacted by an ABC News reporter, Brian Ross, who asked him to confirm that he was a Palfrey client.\n\nTobias contacted the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to tell her he was resigning immediately. The State Department then put out a short statement announcing the resignation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ross reported on ABC News that Tobias had confirmed that he was a regular client of Pamela Martin & Associates, but had said that no sex had been involved in his assignations.\n\n\"They had my number because I called to have gals come over to the condo to give me a massage,\" he is quoted as telling Ross. \"I have now changed services to one with Central American gals.\"\n\nBush said he was saddened by the Tobias resignation, but that it was \"the right thing to do\".\n\nAt the very least, Tobias is open to the charge of hypocrisy. The Bush Administration insists that countries and non-government organisations seeking funds for AIDS programs first officially denounce and make clear that they oppose prostitution. What is more, they must agree to use the funding in the main for abstinence programs, rather, for instance, than to provide condoms to prostitutes and their clients.\n\nThe burning question now is how many like Tobias will be exposed in the coming days and weeks? Sibley is telling journalists that the ABC has identified 1000 customers and could name between five and 10 men whose \"public roles or positions conflict with hiring escorts\".\n\nAn ABC News spokesman said no decision had been made, but if any people were named it would be on the basis of public interest.\n\nMeanwhile, federal officials say they will pursue the case against Palfrey, having lined up as witnesses for the prosecution a number of women who worked for Pamela Martin & Associates and who are apparently prepared to say that they were prostitutes.\n\nSome reports also say several men are prepared to testify that they paid for sex with women working for Palfrey.\n\nIt is not known how many of these men are prominent, but Dick Morris, the former senior Clinton administration adviser who was exposed as a regular user of escorts, has been mentioned as a possible witness. He has refused to comment on reports that he has given a deposition to prosecutors.\n\nPalfrey is begging reporters to forget about the list of phone numbers and focus on the fact that she is being unfairly treated by the federal authorities.\n\n\"Put aside the titillation of the 'who's on the list' question and instead investigate the disturbing genesis, the confounding evolution and the equally alarming continuation of this matter,\" she says. \"I believe there is something very rotten at the core of my circumstance.\""
