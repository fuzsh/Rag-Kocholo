        "text": "WASHINGTON -- A federal jury yesterday convicted a woman of running a prostitution service that catered to members of Washington's political elite.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey, 52, sighed as the verdict was read. She repeatedly had denied the escort service engaged in prostitution, saying that if any of the women had sex for money, they did so without her knowledge.\n\nPalfrey caused a sensation last year when she announced that to raise money for her defense, she intended to sell her phone records to any news outlet willing to pay. Palfrey said her defunct business, Pamela Martin & Associates, was \"a legal, high-end erotic fantasy service\" that catered to elite clients.\n\nShe was convicted on all counts she faced: money laundering, using the mail for illegal purposes, and racketeering.\n\nThree of Palfrey's clients testified during the weeklong trial in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, explaining how they found the service, how often they called, what they were hoping for, and whether they got it during their visits.\n\nBut the trial concluded without revealing many new details about the service or its clients. Sen. David Vitter, R-La., was among possible witnesses but did not take the stand.\n\nVitter has acknowledged being involved with Palfrey's escort service. But after issuing brief statements apologizing for \"a very serious sin,\" he has avoided follow-up questions.\n\nPalfrey, who faces a maximum of 55 years in prison, will remain free pending her sentencing July 24."
