        "text": "THE woman dubbed the \"DC Madam\" killed herself, police said, just weeks after she was convicted of running a callgirl ring that catered to highly placed US Government officials.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey, 52, became a tabloid celebrity in America after her escort ring led to criminal charges and she threatened to reveal the names of the men who patronised her \"erotic fantasy\" service.\n\nPalfrey took her own life at her mother's home in the town of Tarpon Springs, Florida. Her body was discovered in a shed on the property. Florida police said there was a suicide note, but did not disclose its contents or how she killed herself.\n\nPalfrey's lawyer, who represented Monica Lewinsky during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, argued that she marketed legal fantasies and was unaware that her employees sold sex. She was due for sentencing in July and faced a maximum sentence of 55 years.\n\nPalfrey caused a storm in Washington when she revealed she had a client list of more than 10,000 including political officials, chief executive officers and other members of the Washington elite.\n\nAt one point she sought to sell her list of telephone numbers to help pay for her looming costs. But a judge blocked her, and ultimately few big fish were caught in the net. Randall Tobias, an ally of President George Bush and senior official in the State Department, resigned immediately after he surfaced as a Palfrey client."
