Madam” accused of running a Washington, D.C., prostitution ring under the guise of an upscale escort service has been convicted on all charges.\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey, 52, was convicted today of racketeering, money laundering and two counts of using the mail for illegal purposes, reports the Washington Post. She will be sentenced in July.\n\nThe defense in the high-profile case, which involved several lawyers as clients and witnesses at trial, contended that Palfrey wasn’t aware that her clients and employees were having sex."
