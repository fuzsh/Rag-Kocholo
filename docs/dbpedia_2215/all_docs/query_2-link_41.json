The iconic psychedelic raver backed with the original b-side of the single, Tried To Hide. The art is by John Cleveland, and originally adorned the bass drum of the John Ike Waltonâs kit in the band.

The A-side unveils a spacey, beautiful version of âBeri Beriâ from 1982âs Environmental Studies. Stripping back the furious layers of percussion from the mix that appeared on the album, this version throws more light onto Deadly Headly Bennettâs gorgeous sax work and the irrestistable slow motion funk of the rhythm track. Disco as heard in one of the nightclubs from Blade Runner, or a lost balearic anthem from an alternate reality where JA sound systems invade 80s Ibiza. On the flip, the completely unheard âRealigned Dubâ is a masterclass in overlapping rhythms, with drum track and dub-filtered percussion dovetailing around a nonchalant bassline somehow holding the whole thing together. Olatunji-meets-Cymnade! To close proceedings, a sequel to a track from 1981âs My Life In The Hole In The Ground subtracts some of the distinctive boing of the African kuwenge heard in Part 1, but adds melodica drops administered by Doctor Pablo, and some spooky tape-mangled voices from the ether. Cut from the original tapes by CGB at dubplates & mastering in Berlin, this is an essential piece of African Head Charge history which sounds as effective as an immersive headphone listen as it does blasting out of a wall of speakers.\n\nA) 1 - Beri Version - 06:17 B) 2 - Realigned Dub - 04:25, 3 - The Race Part II (3:50)\n\nSuper Mystic Brakes African Head Charge African Head Charge On-U Sound 10\" Vinyl RSD Limited Run / Regional Focus 1000\n\nAfrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force\n\n\"Planet Rock\"\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/16/2016\n\nFormat: 12\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Big Beat/Atlantic/Boysnoize Reco\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThis Record Store Day 12\" features two exclusive remixs of this groundbreaking single that changed the face of hip-hop/dance/electronica when it was originally released in 1982.

Originally self-released by Nick Saloman and limited to just 500 copies, the debut from The Bevis Frond marked the beginning of a highly influential career in underground British neo-psych-rock. Armed with a four-track portastudio, the success of 1986âs âMiasmaâ saw it unexpectedly sell-out quickly with a repress not far behind. Sounding as bracing today as it did then, it collects some of Salomanâs finest songs. Having played in bands since the late 60âs, and constantly writing, Saloman had founded The Von Trap Family and played in Room 13 among others. In fact, he had almost called it a day, but it was the popularity of âMiasmaâ that saw him continue onward and establish himself as an underground legend. A labour of love and fiercely independent, his prolific output has seen as many releases in as many years, an uncompromising vision all under his own label Woronzow. Hailed as âa Hendrix devotee ever bit as tough and contemporary as the serrated guitar chorales of Sonic Youth and Pixiesâ by Rolling Stoneâs David Fricke, his immense psych-stoner-rock has seen him become a cult figure in his own right. The Bevis Frondâs legion of loyal fans includes Teenage Fanclub, Dinosaur Jr and Mary Lou Lord, who have all covered his music.\n\n1. Garden Gate\n\n2. She's In Love With Time\n\n3. Wild Mind\n\n4.

Twenty years after their unceremonious dissolution, drummer Stephens recruited Posies' Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow and a wary Alex Chilton to reform Big Star at the request of two fanatical student DJs from University of Missouri. This two LP Record Store Day gatefold package finally captures that full historic set for the first time on a commercial release, mastered at high resolution from the original master tapes, and adding five previously unreleased performances to itâs original release in 1993 and now accurately re-titled, Complete Columbia: Live at University of Missouri 4/25/93.

On \"Let Me Go Bar Bell Stylee\" Bitty covers his hit over a riddim built using a loop from a 1975 Barbell production. Side B features the late great Bunny Rugs, one of Jamaica's most recognizable voices, better known as the lead singer of mega group Third World. In 2009 Rugs booked studio time to record new songs and in 2009 in Paris to work with producer and Sly & Robbie associate Guillaume Bougard on a new solo album produced with Sly & Robbie. This RSD release features a poignant and soulful cover of \"Rumours\", one of Gregory's biggest hits.

The trio's affection for Peel dated to a very early tour in 1995, when they were lost among the tumbleweeds of a barren Texas landscape. As the band turned the crackling radio dial, the celebrated radio presenter's Northern English accent suddenly piped through their van's speakers with high praiseÂ for the track \"Violent Life\" from their recently released sophomore LP, La Mia Vita Violenta. This unexpected bit of encouragement from Peel helped give the young, extremely road weary and relatively unknown trio the confidence and validation to press on in what had proven to be an arduousÂ road expedition. Five years later, the seasoned threesome eventually played live for Peel's show, and it seemed only fitting that the they christen a brand new, yet-to-be-titled song after their only session with the man held deep in their collective heart. Remastered and released here for the first time on vinyl, \"Where is John?\" b/w \"Missile ++\" speaks not only of a band in the prime of their celebrated sound, but also of the people who helped along the way.\n\n\"Where Is John?\"/\"Missile\"\n\nPeel Sessions Blonde Redhead Blonde Redhead NUMERO GROUP 7\" Vinyl 'RSD First' 1500\n\nBonobo\n\nHenri Texier - Les LeBas (Bonobo Remix)\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/16/2016\n\nFormat: 12\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Ninja Tune\n\nQuantity: 1500\n\nRelease type: 'RSD First'\n\nMORE INFO\n\nIn 2012 Bonobo posted his unofficial remix of the 1977 gem 'Les \"LÃ -Basâ by french jazz legend Henri Texier.

Chicagoâs Jamal Moss records as Hieroglyphic Being, as well as a dizzying number of other names including The Sun God, Insane Black Man, Interplanetary Prophets (with Ital) and Face Of Drums (with Steve Poindexter). His typically raw and distorted re-work of âhi-hats bring the hissâ blends elements of acid house, industrial, and Sun Ra-style synth arpeggios, conjuring up a sense of blown out speakers at a subterranean 4am rave. A US-born, London-based producer, Karen Gwyer has released records for Opal Tapes, No Pain In Pop and Nous. Slowing down âvoid beatâ to a glacial shuffle, subtle shifting textures drift somewhere in between stoned dub disco, fractured techno and the hypnotically repeating motifs of the best kosmische music.

Under the infuence of I-tal Rastafarian vegetarian cooking, (featuring cho-cho and dasheen, amongst a variety of other root vegetables) roots music, and high on Mother Earth, we wrote of the hustlers in Negril, and the ocean's white caps (aka grey horse), galloping across a sea of raw energy, in a foreign land. We then found ourselves in Ocho Rios recording with some of the greats. By day, in the upstairs strip-mall studio, we watched \"Speckles\" (the epic drummer), commanding impossible rhythms out of otherwise mundane tambourines, and Barry O'hare \"playing\" the mix, live, dub-style, like a magical new instrument. By night, we slept under a historic tin roof, in the jungle rain forest with crystal clear river swimming holes, banana spiders, evidence of rats, and lessons in Dominoes, by a man called \"Doggie,\" and a man called \"Manly.\" Cool Pool Reggae is the result.\"\n\n1.

Hard to believe as this is one of Dr. Dreâs earliest production efforts outside of N.W.A. and the full-length also stands as one of his best, and most over-looked, releases. The critical and commercial success of the release was undeniable with the project peaking at Number 20 on the Billboard Top 200 and going on to achieve platinum status. The D.O.C. was a monster on the mic, though his career was cut short due to suffering from a crushed larynx in an automobile accident just 5 months after the release of No One Can Do It Better. Perhaps if that accident had never happened, this album would stand in the hip hop pantheon alongside Straight Out Of Compton and The Chronic. Musically, it is certainly deserving. In addition to Dreâs production, the album features contributions from all members of N.W.A.

Lead vocalist Peter Zaremba came up with the blatantly '60s track, âCardboard Casanovaâ. Besides the beat, the song features the type of lyrical content you'd expect from that era. A punk lead singer, angrily denouncing some girl's preference for the rich guy, who in actuality doesn't 'make it' as a lover anyway. What will she decide? Strangely relevant today. Mike Mills of REM joins in on vocals, and Fleshtones founding member Jan Marek Pakulski might also be somewhere in the mix as well. The 45's sleeve was designed by Herve Peroncini of the rocking Italian band The Peawees. The photos were taken by Jacopo Benessi before a Fleshtones show in La Spezia, Italy. And the songs were recorded with longtime friend of The Fleshtones, Florent Barbier, at Cold Cut Productions Studios.

This Record Store Day Elite Eecords releases Duct Tape Messiah by exceptional Texan Folk artist Blaze Foley for the first time ever on vinyl. The soundtrack to the 2011 documentary film about the turbulent life of Townes Van Zandt's companion and close friend literally spans Blaze's whole musical life. It includes rare archival tracks never released on vinyl before as well as tracks from posthumously released Blaze albums. The limited RSD edition comes with a DVD including the full documentary film. The film beautifully draws the picture of Blaze's life and times and his extraordinary character. Born in Arkansas, Foley was shot to death way before his time, under circumstances still to be fully clarified. As a homeless, he traveled the streets of the Texan cities to share his music with people in nightclubs and bars. Foley always stood up for the weak, which eventually cost his life. Finally, after a life of rejections and blown opportunities, his work is now gaining recognition. In 2008 his biography Living In The Woods In A Tree was published, followed by the acclaimed documentary about Foley!s underdog life: Duct Tape Messiah. The filmâs soundtrack comprises of 14 carefully selected songs from all stations in Blazeâs life and gives an insight into his straight and genuine songwriting. Blaze!s musical heritage was close to being forgotten and much material used on the record are chance discoveries from record shops and old master tapes. Hits like If I Could Only Fly and Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac showcase Foleyâs sound between classic American Country and modern Folk along with his cunning political lyrics and a both punchy and emotional tone. Today, Foley is admired not only by leading American Folk musicians like Nelson, Haggard or Prine, but also by independent artists like Kings Of Leon-singer Caleb Followill.
