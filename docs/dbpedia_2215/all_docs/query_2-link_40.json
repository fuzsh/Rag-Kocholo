        "text": "West African Fiddles in Deep East Texas1\n\nby John Minton\n\n“The fiddles we had then made music,” boasted Bert Strong, born July 1864 near the Louisiana line in Harrison County, Texas, the slave of Dave Cavin. Entering life over a year after the Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863), and only a year before Juneteenth (June 19, 1865, the day Federal troops finally arrived in Galveston to enforce that directive in Texas), Bert, like many of Cavin's thirty-odd slaves, remained with his “old Master” for ten years after freedom, maintaining Cavin's plantation in conditions for the most part unchanged by Lincoln's Proclamation, the Federal Occupation, or the 13th Amendment. Over a half century later, Strong dictated his memoirs to an interviewer for the Depression-era WPA ex-slave narratives project. Of the weekly entertainments on Cavin's 400-acre farm, he recalled, “My old Master give the chil'ren a candy pulling every Saturday night and had them wrestling and knocking each other about. The big fo'ks had dances and parties. They had fiddles but they warn't like these things they have now. The fiddles we had then made music.”2\n\nWhile Bert Strong may have been a bit hard on twentieth-century fiddling, his disdain is understandable nevertheless. Although black fiddle music didn't disappear entirely after 1900, it indisputably diminished, especially relative to earlier years, when black violinists dominated music-making within their own communities—and held considerable sway among whites as well. Fiddling slaves were remarked in the American colonies as early as the 1600s; from then until the end of the nineteenth century, the violin proved the most popular of all instruments among black musicians, surpassing even the banjo, an instrument of known African origin.\n\nBy the turn of this century, however, all that had changed, a shift conveniently illustrated by the contrast between Texas's great “songster” Mance Lipscomb (1895–1976) and his father, Charles. Born a slave in Alabama, Charles Lipscomb was “sold away” from his parents as a child and brought to the Brazos bottoms. Here he fashioned his first fiddle from a cigar box and, following Emancipation, advanced to the status of full-time professional—still something of a rarity in that time and place—playing dances for blacks and whites alike. It was at such functions that Charles’ son Bowdie Glenn—or “Mance” as he came to be known—gained his first experience as a performer, seconding his father not on the violin or even the banjo but on the guitar, the instrument that in the twentieth-century would eclipse all others among southern blacks, assuming the first place once held by the fiddle. And although throughout his life Mance continued to perform many of the genres characterizing his father's generation—dance tunes and ballads, love lyrics and spirituals, even Tin Pan Alley compositions filtered through oral tradition—he also excelled in a newer idiom inextricably linked to the guitar: the blues.3\n\nBut if black fiddlers were in this century largely drowned out by guitar-playing bluesmen, their influence is audible to this day in the playing of their white counterparts, reflecting the lasting though largely neglected African-American contribution to American fiddling generally. Ironically, while this tradition is popularly viewed as a quintessential expression of America's Anglo-Saxon-cum-Celtic heritage, its truly distinctive character arguably derives from its African-American roots. As Roger Abrahams has written, the fiddle music of nineteenth-century blacks “was not African, though the tunes were made uniquely Afro-American as they were rendered by slaves.” Even if “the fiddler played a European instrument,” he usually succeeded in “bending it to his own aesthetic purpose,…working within the constraints of [both] the intensely melodic [European] as well as metrically layered [African] tradition.”4 Moreover, just as blacks adopted the European violin, whites quickly assimilated the Africanized idioms that resulted. Accordingly, by the end of the nineteenth-century, American fiddling—whether performed by blacks or whites—was distinguished from its British and Irish antecedents largely by its “blackness,” apparent, for instance, in the syncopated rhythms blending African-American metrical concepts and European-American melodic forms such as the reel, jig, and hornpipe, or in the minor tonalities or “blue notes” similarly reflecting the influence of black tradition.\n\nCuriously, few figures in American music are at once as renowned and recondite as the black fiddler. Notwithstanding the fiddle's longstanding preeminence in American black music, the most conspicuous evidence for that long tenure is its mere passing mention. Such is the case, for example, with the notorious notices for fugitive slaves, often described for would-be pursuers as “fond of playing upon the fiddle,” having “played well on the violin,” and so forth.5 More detailed accounts do exist, of course, scattered throughout printed ephemera from the colonial period to the present. It is only recently, however, as more benign detectives have tracked these fugitive sources, that a fuller, more humanistic portrait of the African-American fiddler has began to emerge, exemplified by Abrahams's Singing the Master.\n\nActually, Abrahams's interest in fiddling is incidental to its role in the cornshucking as a cultural institution in the plantation South simultaneously revealing the perpetuation or reinterpretation of African, the assimilation or adaptation of European, and the creation and dissemination of distinctively African-American traditions. More fundamentally, Abrahams and I also share as a primary resource the astounding body of narratives gathered from ex-slaves during the 1930s by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Works Progress Administration, truly one of the more promising vistas in black music research. Not that previous scholars have neglected these data. In the half century between the appearance of Benjamin Botkin's Lay My Burden Down (1945)—the first major publication drawn from the WPA's collection—and Singing the Master (1992)—only one of the more recent—there have appeared literally dozens of books and articles drawn wholly or in part from the WPA corpus.6 Still, there remain many unexplored byways, testimony to the breadth and richness of the ex-slave narratives. In Texas alone, the Project's fieldworkers interviewed over six hundred former slaves, whose reminiscences fill nearly six thousand pages of typescript. Moreover, it is only relatively recently that the full range of this material has become generally available. Long relegated to the Rare Book Room of the Library of Congress, or lying fallow in regional archives, the WPA oeuvre has over the past two decades been published almost in its entirety, an inestimable boon to researchers of black music and song.7\n\nIt is primarily from these narratives, then, and primarily from the Texas materials, that I have attempted to sketch one underappreciated facet of American black fiddling. It is, in fact, from one of these narrators that I have taken my cue. While some might dismiss Bert Strong's reminiscences as mere nostalgic bluster or off-hand hyperbole—perhaps that's even what he intended, we'll never know for sure—there's nonetheless more than a bit of truth behind his boasting. In one sense, of course, black fiddling and fiddlers indisputably were more prevalent in Strong's younger years—that much is certain. But maybe Bert Strong wasn't just stating the obvious. Because in reality, many of the fiddles that transported Africans played really weren't like these things we have now: they really were literally, physically, objectively different from the instruments we now know as fiddles. And these very real, objective differences, and their very real and lasting influence on the subjective responses of black musicians and their communities, may well explain why the music these fiddles made seemed so much more real, so much more like real music, to an East Texan only a generation or two removed from West Africa. I think we should take Bert Strong at his word, then, especially given the other overwhelming evidence that many of the fiddles that enslaved Africans played really weren't like these things they have now; rather, the things they had then still drew directly on American fiddling's West African background.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the facility with which enslaved Africans in the New World adopted, and adapted to, the European violin is attributable in large part to the prevalence of fiddles of various types throughout sub-Saharan Africa. And, in fact, many of the fiddles played by American blacks weren't European at all. Reports of homemade instruments like Charles Lipscomb's “cigarbox fiddle” are commonplace, and, while descriptions are often scanty, it only makes sense that these ostensibly unorthodox items at least partly perpetuated African traditions rather than merely imitating their European counterparts. Take the case of Jack Maddox. Born in Georgia in 1849 but brought to Mount Enterprise, Texas, about 1853, he recalled that “Judge Maddox [his owner] bought a nigger man who had a three string fiddle. I used to hear him play and sing.” Clearly, at least, this wasn't a four-string European violin; more likely, it derived from West Africa, where one commonly finds fiddles of from one to five strings, including numerous three-string varieties.\n\nOther evidence for West African fiddles in East Texas is still more conclusive. For instance, ninety-six-year-old Harre Quarls of Madisonville testified “Massa tells us we's free June ’teenth. I leaves. I made a fiddle out of a gourd ’fore freedom and larns to play it. I played for dances after I's free.” Born March 12, 1844, in Rusk County, Anderson Edwards also recalled fiddles fashioned from gourds: “On Saturday nights we'd sing and dance,” he declared. “We made our own instruments, which was gourd fiddles and quill flutes.” So did Litt Young, born in 1850 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, but since 1865 a resident of Harrison County. “We had small dances on Saturday night and play ring plays, and have banjo and fiddle playing and knock bones together,” he affirmed. “There was all kinds of fiddles made from gourds and things.”\n\nYoung, Edwards, and Quarls are describing the gourd fiddle found throughout much of West Africa—and most of the American South. The Englishman Hugh Clapperton observed such an instrument in Dahomey (now the West African state of Benin) in the 1820s, constructed of “three strings of horse hair, not in single hairs but a number for each string untwisted, the bow the same; the body of the violin was formed of half a long gourd; the bridge, two cross sticks; the top, the skin of a guana [iguana] stretched tightly over the edges; the neck was about two feet long, ornamented with plates of brass, having a hollow brass knob at the end.”8 A year or two later, another British traveler, John Finch, encountered the same artifact in the United States, where, he reported, “A black boy will make an excellent fiddle out of a gourd and some string.”9 Actually, as in Africa, the American article was usually strung with horsehair—in the South the gourd fiddle was even called the “gourd-and-horsehair”—and covered with hide. Tellingly, although it was bowed instead of strummed or plucked, the gourd fiddle was of a kind with the banjo, which in its earliest stages also consisted of a gourd resonator fitted with a hide membrane and strung with horse hair. (In fact, the cast-off materials employed in other homemade fiddles—besides cigar boxes, sardine cans, tobacco tins, and the like were also commonly used—may simply have been ready substitutes for the traditional calabash.)\n\nDespite occasional, casual commentaries from observers like Finch, the best evidence for the gourd fiddle's currency in North America comes from the ex-slave narratives, establishing that, at the very least, this instrument was known among slaves and their descendants in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas, with the most examples by far coming from the last.10 Whatever the limitations of our documentation, then, the gourd fiddle's American currency seems impressive indeed, spanning seven contiguous southern states from the Atlantic to the Brazos bottoms and hinting at an even wider provenience, assuming, that is, that these confirmed cases are but a fraction of the actual total. This is just supposition, of course. Moreover, as with other African traits and traditions, the gourd fiddle clearly underwent various modifications in the New World, obscuring its precise lineage, even in those rare instances where we have reasonably concrete descriptions. However, its most likely ancestor is the one-string West African fiddle usually known as the goge. Typically consisting of a calabash resonator covered with the skin of a reptile (lizard, alligator, or snake) and strung with horsehair, the goge is played throughout the Sudan or savannah belt region, an area accounting for most New World slaves. Admittedly, many African-American fiddles are described as having two or more strings, but then so do many West African instruments, even within the goge's provenience. And one-string fiddles, whether made from gourds or otherwise, were until fairly recently common among American blacks. (In one striking example, Ruben Laird, born in 1850 in Panola County, Mississippi, remembered that on the plantation where he was raised “music was provided principally by a ‘fiddle,’ an improvised instrument made by bending a stick in the shape of a bow, holding it in shape with a string and sawing on it with a crude violin bow made of the hair of a horse's mane and tail.”11) Anyway, we're probably safe in assuming that many if not most of the homemade fiddles played by black southerners are at least distant relatives of the West African goge.12\n\nSometimes, moreover, even the most casual mention of such homemade instruments is sufficient to implicate, if not precisely to demarcate, the profound cultural continuities within the African diaspora. Consider the recollections of another Harrison County native, Simp Campbell, or the corroborative testimony of Georgian Chaney Mack. Born in 1860, the slave of W. L. Sloan, Campbell exclaimed, “On Saturday night you'd hear them fiddles, banjoes and guitars playing and the darkies singing. All the music gadgets was home-made. The banjoes was made of round pieces of wood, civered (covered) with sheepskin and strung with catgut strings. One of the oldest fiddlers of slavery time teached my brother Flint to play the fiddle.” Chaney Mack was also born around 1860, but in Georgia, where his father had been transported directly from Africa at the age of eighteen. “He made himself a fiddle outa pine bark and usta play fer us to dance,” Mack related of his father.\n\nUnfortunately for us, Campbell doesn't elaborate on the construction of all the “music gadgets” he mentions, nor does Chaney Mack explain exactly how a fiddle might be made of pine bark; nonetheless these narrators quite pointedly intimate how African fiddles and fiddling style might have endured for generations past the Middle Passage.\n\nThis isn't to say that these traditions retained their original form or existed in a vacuum, especially given the constant interactions of black and white musicians. On the one hand, white youngsters were also tutored by black musicians. W. S. Needham, Jr. (one of eight elderly whites interviewed as part of the Texas ex-slave narratives project) was born in Alabama but raised in Mississippi and Texas, where he learned to fiddle from one of his father's slaves, “a nigger by the name of Mance.”\n\nMance was a good fiddler. He loved to teach me to play, and I picked it up right away. By rights, a nigger by the name of “Friday” gave me my first lesson, when I wasn't but three years old, but dad gave him to my oldest sister when she married. When I was six, Mance taught me to jig and play such pieces as “Turkey in the Straw,” “Molly Put de Kittle On,” “Run Nigger Run,” “Old Dan Tucker,” and such pieces, and taught me to go on like they did. I just picked it right up now, and made a many a dollar by playing for dances and such after I got grown.\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that white fiddling bears the imprint of black tradition. Of course, influences also flowed in the other direction. Born in 1850 in Louisiana but brought to Texas around 1860, Guy Stewart was just one of dozens of former slaves remarking that circumstance. “De Marster am a good fiddler,” he recollected. “He larns some ob de niggers hows to play de fiddle and some de banjo. Lots ob times us all gets tugather, weuns den plays de music, sing and dance.”\n\nGranted, too, most black fiddlers eventually forsook homemade instruments for the European violin. As early as the 1830s, John Finch qualified his observation that “a black boy will make an excellent fiddle out of a gourd and some string” by adding that “the supreme ambition of every negro is to procure a real violin.”14 Finch is actually describing a common progression, since many black fiddlers learned to play on homemade instruments, only later securing the “fotched-on” variety. As an anonymous ex-slave from Tennessee told Ophelia Settle Egypt, “I used to be a great fiddler. I fust learned how to play on a long gourd with horsehair strings on it. ‘Course I couldn't go very high on it, but it done pretty well. That was the fust of my learning to play. After a while I bought me a fiddle for $1.80, and after so long a time I bought me a fiddle sure enough.”15 Born in the 1830s near Buckhead, Georgia, Henry Wright offered a similar account. “I made a fiddle out of a large sized gourd,” he related. “A long wooden handle was used as the neck, and the hair from a horse's tail was used for the bow. The strings were made of cat-gut. After I learned to play this I bought a better violin.”16 Aside from its cultural consequence or practical advantages (for obvious reasons, the acquisition of such a valuable object as a violin could prove a bit problematic for persons themselves regarded as chattel), the pattern obviously also encouraged the transposition of tunes and techniques from the gourd fiddle to the “store-boughten” article.\n\nIntriguingly, Henry Wright's reference to cat-gut strings also suggests that, just as black and white fiddle styles merged, African and European instruments were sometimes literally combined, and other descriptions of gourd fiddles confirm that some of these incorporated features of the European violin. (The most dramatic illustration of this hybridization that I've encountered is an instrument fashioned by an anonymous Southern black around 1900, in which a gourd resonator is fitted with the neck, head, and tailpiece of a European-style violin.17) Again, the evidence is clear on one point: even as African-Americans selectively assimilated instruments, tunes, or techniques from their white neighbors, they re-tooled these according to indigenous templates.\n\nSuch tendencies were further reinforced by other instrumental traditions. True, the fiddle was not only the most popular instrument among nineteenth-century blacks; it was often the only instrument, as confirmed by innumerable ex-slaves. (Harry Johnson, for instance, insisted “I never seen no kind of music but a fiddle till I was grown,” while Willie [Uncle Bill] Blackwell averred “We had lots of dances dem days [he was one hundred and three at the time of the interview] and with jus’ one fiddle.”) Just as often, however, black fiddlers performed with ensembles, sometimes composed entirely of homemade instruments based on African prototypes. The banjo is the best-known of these, of course (Emma Weeks of Austin even remembered a banjo picker called “Joe Slick” who'd been brought directly from Africa). However, the “quills” recollected by Anderson Edwards were also routinely paired with the fiddle. Actually, this term was applied both to pan pipes and, less frequently, to homemade fifes, both easily fashioned from East Texas's abundant cane or reeds, though green willow was sometimes used for the latter. Like Edwards, Bill Homer (born 1850) recalled the typical dance band as “de fiddle an’ de quill.”\n\nW'at am de quill? I's splain, dey am made f'om de willow stick w'en de sap am up. Yous takes de stick an’ poun's on de bahk ’til it am loose, den slips de bahk off. Aftah dat, slit de wood in one end, an’ down one side. Put holes in de bahk, an’ den put de bahk back on de stick. De quill am den ready to play lak de flute. Some ob de niggers larn to be good quill players.\n\nOphelia Porter, by contrast, remembered that “quills [were] made out of joints of canes ’bout de size of you finger; dey would plait dese togedder with twine an’ blow through dem like dey was a French harp [i.e., a harmonica].”18\n\nAdmittedly, pan pipes and cane fifes aren't unique to Africa, but they do figure prominently in African traditions, dispelling any doubt about the immediate antecedents of African-American quills. The same can be said of the bones remembered by Litt Young and others—take, for example, Louisiana native Charley Williams, who also recalled how the slaves would “go back to de quarter and git de gourd fiddles and de clapping bones made out'n beef ribs, and bring em back so we could have some music”19—merely one of many percussion instruments with African pedigrees, most of them teamed with the fiddle at one time or another. As with the gourd fiddle, these African archetypes were in the New World adapted to the ready-made or readily available. Thus the principle behind the bones was eventually transferred to the spoons. The African scraper or rasp also assumed a number of new forms in the New World, for example, the jawbone (the mandible of a draft animal played by raking its teeth with a key or the like), itself gradually replaced by the washboard or even an ordinary garden hoe. Joe Oliver was born in 1847 in Hill County. Describing white dances around Waco in the 1870s and 1880s, he noted that “If de w'ite folks fiddler did not come den dey has de ole black fiddler whose name wuz Caleb, he plays de fiddle, ‘nother plays de jews harp, an’ still ‘nother one plays de hoe by scrapin’ on hit wid a case knife.” Sometimes a handsaw was put to the same use, an arrangement still closer to the jawbone. With a saw, though, one could even second the fiddle's melody line. George Strickland, a slave in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, recounted how “De wimmen folks had a big time at quiltings and somebody would play old gourds with horse-hair strings, called ‘old gourd and horsehair dance.’ Cornshucking was de greatest thing er tall, master took a jug er licker ‘roun’ and got dem tight and when dey got full, dey would histe master up and toat him ‘roun’ and holler, then the fun started and dey would play de old gourd and horse-hair dance, the hand-saw and case knife, dey could run dey hand up and down de saw to change de tune.”20\n\nSo while circumstance often determined the stuff of such performances, style and function still depended largely on African precedents, discernible in even the most seemingly pedestrian instruments. For example, cowbells, skillets, and kettles were also beaten to keep time for fiddles, recalling the bell-shaped West African agogo, while the jugs lending their names to “jug bands” (which frequently included fiddlers) are relatives of the “hollow vessels that, in African music, are blown to represent the voices of ancestral spirits.”21 Cymbals or gongs too were improvised from common household items, as revealed by Josephine Tippit Compton. Born near Waco in 1862, she remembered: “When we had de crowds to come to our house for dances we had a fiddle fur music an’ kept time wid skillet lids hit together.” Tambourines were sometimes specially fashioned from hides stretched over small wooden frames or bisected gourds—the similarity to the construction of banjos and African fiddles is hardly coincidental—but tin pans could also be used in a pinch. Indeed, the compound “banjo picking and tin pan beating” occurs so frequently in the ex-slave narratives as to suggest a distinct musical genre (almost predictably, tin pans were themselves sometimes used as resonators in homemade banjos), but tambourines (and tin pans) just as often kept time for the fiddle. Sarah Wilson, for instance, confided that “Dey [her owners] didn't ’low me to ’tend de nigger parties, but I ‘member ’bout de fiddles an’ de tamborenes dey had an’ played.”\n\nEven lacking instruments, dancers and bystanders contributed, or contributed to, the fiddle's accompaniment by clapping and patting, shuffling and stamping, snapping their fingers, and so forth. Finally, the fiddle itself sometimes doubled as a percussion instrument, most notably, through the practice called “beating straws.” Freestone County's Sam Forge (born c. 1850) described the technique in a wonderful early account of that venerable Texas institution, the fiddlers’ contest. “W'en de contest start each man plays his best,” he explained. “An’ most of de time he has somebody to accompany him, sometimes wid a straw lookin’ piece he put across de strings of de fiddle, den he bounce hit up an’ down on de strings an’ beat out his accompanyin’ de fiddler, de faster de fiddler plays de faster de boy jig his ‘companying for him.” Actually, the second musician was more often equipped with a pair of straws (sticks, bones, or knitting needles were all popular alternatives), though the fiddler alone could achieve this same effect simply by striking the bow against the strings or the fingerboard. The practice of beating straws is also widespread among southern whites (in fact, it's unclear from Forge's description whether the fiddlers in question are white or black or, probably, both). It has even been attributed to European tradition, though the evidence for that claim is unconvincing. More likely, the custom originated in North America, where it is entirely more consistent with black traditions, which routinely exploit the percussive possibilities of melodic instruments (or the melodic possibilities of percussion instruments), often in contrast to white approaches to the same items.22\n\nRanking among the most consistent and striking components of American black fiddling, these percussive traditions accordingly offer still another direct link to Africa, where most of the same percussion instruments—or, for that matter, gourd lutes prefiguring the banjo or cane flutes not unlike the quills—are traditionally played with the fiddle. Tellingly, too, a gourd fiddle figures in one of the most comprehensive accounts of such practices on American soil, the narrative of ex-slave Wash Wilson. Born in 1842 in Louisiana, Wash was eighteen or so when he and his family were brought to Texas; the music he heard both in Ouachita Parish and later in the Brazos bottoms was, however, barely distinguishable from that of his African forebears. “Dar wuzn't no money ter buy er muzic insterment,” he remembered.\n\nUs ’ud take pieces of sheep's rib, er a cow's jaw, er a piece ob iron wid an old kettle er a piece ob wood, a hollow gourd an’ er few horse hairs an’ make er drum er things ter make muzic wid. Some times dey ’ud git a piece ob de trunk ob a tree, hollowed out an’ stretch er sheep er a goat's skin ober um. Dese ’ud be from one to four feet high an’ six to er leetle more dan er foot ercross…. Dar wuz in general two togedder ter play wid dar fingers er two sticks on dis drum. Nebber seed meny in Texas. Dey had ’em in Louisiana an’ on our place in Texas. Dey ’ud take er bufferlo horn an’ scrape hit out an’ make er flute. Dat ’ud shore be heard er long ways off. Den dey ’ud take er mule's jawbone an’ rattle a stick ercross its teef’. Dey ’ud sometimes take er barrel an’ stretch er ox's hide ercross one end an’ er man ’ud set astride de barrel an’ beat upon de hide wid he hands, he feet, an’ effen he git ter feelin’ de muzic in he bones, he'd beat on de barrel wid he haid. Anodder man ’ud beat on de wooden side wid sticks.\n\nActually, Wilson doesn't specify whether the “hollow gourd an’ er few horse hairs” was bowed as a fiddle or plucked like a banjo, though circumstantial evidence indicates the former. In any case, the instrument is intrinsically suited to an ensemble as typical of West Africa as East Texas or Western Louisiana.23\n\nObviously the gourd fiddle never attained the banjo's popularity. Even so, it was widely adopted by southern whites. In the southern Appalachians especially, gourd fiddles (as well as gourd banjos) were at one time quite common among white musicians.24 However, the most striking example I've found is an isolated instance from far West Texas, the case of Alexander Campbell “Eck” Robertson, undisputed patriarch of modern “Texas style” fiddling. Actually, Robertson was born November 20, 1887 in northeastern Arkansas. When he was three, however, his family moved from the Ozarks to Amarillo, where Eck was soon experimenting with the fiddle, eventually taking up the guitar and banjo as well. By the early 1920s, he had already established a reputation as one of West Texas's best old-time fiddlers, playing at dances and contests, in medicine shows, for silent movies, even traveling regularly to the Southeast to perform at the Annual Old Confederate Soldiers’ Reunions. It was during one such event, held at Richmond in 1922, that Eck and Oklahoma fiddler Henry C. Gilliland detoured to New York and persuaded the Victor Company to record a few of their tunes. The results were some of the first commercial recordings of white country music, including Robertson's now-legendary “Sally Goodin,” which, with its dozen-odd variations on a single melodic strain, remains to this day an article of faith among acolytes of Texas-style fiddling.25\n\nIn his later years, Robertson reckoned as his all-time favorite instrument a Jacob Stainer violin he inherited from his brother—“one of the best fiddles I ever pulled a bow on,” as he characterized it.26 Many a classically trained musician might have agreed. Jacob Stainer (1621–1683) was the greatest of all German violin makers, judged the rival of Stradivarius. A Stainer was a high-toned instrument indeed for a West Texas fiddler. It was also of a quite different order from Eck Robertson's first fiddle, which he fashioned himself at the age of five from a long necked gourd topped with a tanned cat hide.27\n\nConsidering the short shrift sometimes accorded black fiddlers, at least relative to their white counterparts, it's rather revealing, not to mention more than a little ironic, that such a seminal figure in “Anglo-American” fiddling as A. C. Robertson learned to play on an African instrument. It's ironic, too, that we may still hear a distant echo of West African fiddling in the playing of white Texans.\n\nNot that black fiddling ever disappeared altogether. To the contrary, literally dozens of black fiddlers appeared on “race records” during the 1920s and 1930s; many others have been recorded by folklorists in the field. Some of these performances recall nineteenth-century traditions, others reflect black tradition's inherent resilience. In fact, while the guitar has always been the blues instrument par excellence, there is an established tradition of blues fiddling that persists to the present, for instance, in the playing of Texas blues great Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown. Individually, Brown embodies the generational shift represented by Charles and Mance Lipscomb, while taking that transition a step further still. Although he is among the last living exponents of the African-American fiddling tradition, he first made a name for himself as one of a school of Texas recording artists who in the post-War years adapted the rural blues to the electric guitar and the urban swing band.28\n\nEven though the blues thus signaled a definite shift in African-American music, the break with nineteenth-century traditions was hardly absolute. To the contrary, during the early twentieth century especially, much of what went before was still being performed under the rubric of blues. Clearly that characterization applies to Big Joe Williams's “Baby Please Don't Go,” one of the most influential blues records of the pre-World War II era, one of the most popular blues compositions of all time, in fact. First issued by the Bluebird label in 1935, Williams's original version features the Mississippi-born singer/composer on his own creation, the nine-string guitar, accompanied by a washboard—and a one-string fiddle.29\n\nRecorded a century after the end of the African slave trade, an ocean and half a continent away from the African “slave coast,” “Baby Please Don't Go” points us both back to West Africa and a half century ahead, both replicating and anticipating the work of contemporary Malian guitarist Ali Farka Touré. Often likened to such American bluesmen as John Lee Hooker or Lightnin’ Hopkins, Touré's own bluesy performances bear comparison to the work of Joe Williams as well: alternating between acoustic and electric guitar, Touré, Mali's premier recording artist, is typically accompanied only by a calabash rattle, an instrument sounding distinctly like a washboard, and the njarka, the local version of West Africa's single-string gourd fiddle.30\n\nGatemouth Brown and Mance Lipscomb, Ali Farka Touré and Joe Williams, Bert Strong—and Eck Robertson. These are but a few links in a recursive chain of continual change and startling continuities stretching from the Western Sudan to East and even West Texas. Admittedly, the black fiddler's day appears to have passed, on this side of the Atlantic anyway. But folk traditions seldom really disappear, nor does their creative energy simply dissipate. So it is that today, the ingenuity and inspiration once spent on the fiddle are merely re-channeled into other pursuits.\n\nThere's no denying that Bert Strong and the many ex-slaves who voiced the same sentiments were at least partly right: black fiddles don't make music like they used to. Certainly, too, we share in that loss. But how lucky we are for those few that remain—and for these things we have now.\n\nCritical References With Bibliography\n\nTwo solid preliminary surveys of instrumental traditions in the WPA collection are Bruce A. MacLeod, “The Musical Instruments of North American Slaves,” Mississippi Folklore Register 11 (1977): 34–49, and Robert B. Winans, “Black Instrumental Music Traditions in the Ex-Slave Narratives,” Black Music Research Journal 10 (1990): 43–53. For an annotated index of music and song generally in the ex-slave narratives, see Eileen Southern and Josephine Wright, African-American Traditions in Song, Sermon, Tale, and Dance, 1600s-1920: An Annotated Bibliography of Literature, Collections, and Artworks (New York: Greenwood Press, 1990), pp. 208–26. This source should be used with some caution, however, as it omits many examples, also a factor in Jacobs's, Index to the American Slave, which features headings for “Slave Dancing,” “Slave Music and Songs,” “Spirituals,” and so forth.
