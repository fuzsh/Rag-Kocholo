        "text": "Beginning of the article: \"‘Popular culture’ is a broad term, especially if the meaning of ‘culture’ is understood as referring to “[…] whatever is distinctive about the ‘way of life’ of a people, community, nation or social group.” (Hall 1997: 2) However, for the purpose of this collection of articles, a useful distinction is between cultural practices such as drinking, eating, sports, fashion or religion and those forms of popular culture which are, in a more narrow sense, artistic cultural expressions, encompassing different genres such as music, theatre, dance, visual arts and literature. As Barber (1997: 1) points out, music is the first form of popular culture in Africa which has been (noticed and) studied outside the African continent. (cf. Fabian 1997 [1978]: 18) The still rather strong focus on music in the study of popular culture is also reflected in this special issue which is almost exclusively dedicated to this genre. 1 Popular culture has long been regarded as an unworthy subject of academic study (cf. Fabian 1997 [1978]: 18, Street 2001: 302, Marchart 2008: 11) – an attitude which was upheld perhaps even more strongly by academics in Africa as Wa Mungai (2008: 58) notes with reference to Kenya. This rejection was largely based on a perception of popular culture as “trash”, as an inferior kind of culture. (cf. Newell 2002: 3, cf. Hobsbawm 1995 [1994]: 514) Scholarly discussions of popular culture in Africa have for long revolved around the question of ‘authenticity’; especially with regard to popular music the introduction of musical elements from Western musical styles has often been viewed as a loss of it. (Kirkegaard 2002: 13) [...]\" Full reference: Englert, Birgit. 2008. Popular Music and Politics in Africa – Some Introductory Reflections. In: Stichproben.
