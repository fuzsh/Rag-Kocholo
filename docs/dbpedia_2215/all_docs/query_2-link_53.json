Dead Moon was my friends favorite band and soon to become one of mine. It was the first of many shows he booked for them and I was lucky enough to get to know and play along side Fred, Toody and Andrew. They played before a band and proceeded to usurp the room with their straight up, stripped back, raw honesty and unbelievably great songs. Since joining A Place To Bury Strangers, we haven't recorded a single cover, until now. I like that APTBS has never made carbon copy versions of covers and has always made each song their own.Â When Oliver came up with the idea to do Strange Moon, itÂ sounded like such an exciting and interesting project. A Place To Bury Strangers doing Dead Moon?

One of the highlights of Captain Beefheartâs 1968 tour of the UKwas the concert at Frank Freemanâs Dance Club in Kidderminster. Fortunately legendary DJ John Peel brought his tape recorder and recorded four brilliant numbers from the show which appear on this album along with four other tracks from that era. Pride of place on the front cover of the LP goes to one of the recently discovered 1968 screen printed posters for the Frank Freemanâs Beefheart show. With Beefheart coming from a country where band names like Quicksilver Messenger Service and Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen were de rigeur, when Peel told Captain Beefheart he was driving him to a concert venue in Kidderminster called Frank Freemanâs Dance Club , Beefheart said âWhat a groovy nameâ thinking it was in the same hippy west coast vibe as the aforementioned bands. Peel explained it wasnât a groovy name but simply a Dance Club run by Frank Freeman.\n\nTrack list : Side 1 : Rollin and Tumblin, Well well well, Electricity, Neon meat dreams of a octafish.

His music, which could be described as \"proto champeta\", is the result of many influences: Congolese music, cumbia, disco, Afrobeat, pop, Haitian compas, psychedelic guitarâ¦ Abelardo's trademark is the ability to recycle bits of just about anything into a captivating rhythmic groove which has no equal.\n\nMuÃ©vela / La negra del negrerÃ­o\n\nMuevela / La Negra Del Negrerio Abelardo Carbono Carbono, Abelardo Vampisoul 7\" Vinyl RSD Exclusive 200\n\nNeal Casal\n\nMountains of the Moon / Grimes' Surf Story\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nFormat: 7\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: The Royal Potato Family\n\nQuantity: 500\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\n\"Mountains of the Moon\"/\"Grimes' Surf Story\" -\n\n7-Inch featuring Neal's remake of the Grateful Dead classic song\"\n\nMountains of the Moon / Grimes' Surf Story Neal Casal Casal, Neal The Royal Potato Family 7\" Vinyl RSD Exclusive 500\n\nThe Casket Girls\n\nThe Casket Girls\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nLabel: Graveface Records\n\nQuantity: 500\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThe Casket Girls is a new three-piece band hailing from Savannah, GA.

This particular house happens to be the historical Star Theater in downtown Portland Oregon. Built in 1911, the theater has a rich and seedy past. Known for many years as a house of ill-repute it hosted burlesque in the 40s (regularly featuring such legendary dancers as Tempest Storm, Candy Renee and Arabella Andre), adult films in the 60s, and an all nude revue in the 70s and 80s. Ultimately the building was shut down and left empty after being busted for housing a ''modern day speakeasy''. In 2011, 100 years after erection, the building was remodeled to look as it did in its heyday. The old neon marquee was rebuilt and the interior fully restored. The Historic Star Theater now hosts live concerts, variety shows, and of course burlesque. Cooper cut her performance teeth as a burlesque singer in Portland and jumped at the chance to play a show at this beautiful venue with a sordid past in the City of Roses.\n\nCOOPER\n\nIt has been a year and a half since Cooper packed up her VW van in Portland, OR and made the quest to Nashville, TN. The flame haired songstress had paid her dues in Portland playing in several bands, working two jobs to pay for college, and moonlighting as a burlesque performer at the wildly popular Sinferno Cabaret downtown. It was time to take a shot at her lifetime dream of recording her songs and forming a road band in music city. After months of knocking on doors, typical hard luck, and sleeping on an air mattress in a 60's hotel room-turned studio apartment, Cooper was able to make some headway. She assembled a twelve piece soul band in both Nashville and Portland and began rehearsing both. She started writing the record she had always dreamed of making, drawing from her love of old Soul and Motown records and her 60's and 70's Rock n Roll influences. Cooper played her first gig in Nashville opening for the Queen of Rock and Roll herself: Wanda Jackson, at a birthday bash held for fashion icon Manuel. Her music caught the ear of music industry notables and she recorded her full length album at one of Nashville's top recording studios: The Tracking Room.\n\nSIDE A- I WANNA LOVE YOU\n\nA retro nod to the likes of Ike and Tina Tuner, ''I Wanna Love You'' packs a punch. Sprinkled with soulful snaps and groovy back up vocals, the song sneaks up on the listener like a sugary spoonful of turpentine. Cooper's buttery vocals glide over the melody, then suddenly blast into a wild fit of raspy funk and sexy abandon. The thick bass line holds down the groove while the horns pour over the top. This dynamic and explosive tune fills the beautiful arched ceiling of the Star Theater and reflects off of the excited crowd lucky enough to have been there that night. The mix is sweet and is the type of music that was made to go straight to vinyl.\n\nSIDE B- BABY I LOVE YOU\n\nCooper covers this Aretha Franklin superhit with a tenacity not many young women can muster. Her powerful voice is soaked in soul and belts the tune with a voluptuous ease. This live recording is warm and full. The band is smokin' hot and includes a ripping tenor sax solo as well as a funky slap bass breakdown. Cooper's fiery vocal personality sets the recording ablaze and leaves the listener reaching for a cigarette, or at least a cold drink.\n\nFOR FANS OF: Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Duffy, Joss Stone, Mayer Hawthorne, Stax Records, Motown Records\n\nHOMETOWN: Nashville TN\n\nKEY MARKETS: Nashville TN, Portland OR, Austin TX, San Francisco CA, Tokyo Japan\n\nI Wanna Love You / Baby I Love You [7''] (Live at the Historic Star Theater) Cooper Cooper Violet Fire Records 7\" Vinyl RSD Exclusive 500\n\nCountry Joe and the Fish\n\nI Feel Like I'm Fixin To Die\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nFormat: 12\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Vanguard\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\nRe-issue of Country Joe & the Fishâs landmark 1967 psychedelic album.

A friend of mine recently described Cuntz as \"evil\". I hear Flipper-esque barbs in the lead singer Ben Mackie's delivery, whilst the sounds remind me of '80s Melbourne noise miscreants Venom P. Stinger. These young guys that make up Cuntz were not even born when these two bands were (originally) around. Topping it off, and my personal favourite distinguishing feature is the understated guitar shards behind it all, never over-bearing, but traces of the The Birthday Party abound. There's also some synth parts played on a few tracks, which only adds to the feelings of a down-trodden existence that I attempt to explain below.\n\nIs it any coincidence then, with comparisons to Flipper, Venom P. Stinger and The Birthday Party, that the subject matter of Aloha seems to focus firmly on the seedier aspects of society and life in general? Tracks like opener \"Homeless\" with it's slacker vibe (a common theme present here) and downer tone is never more obvious than \"Mate, I don't have a dollar/You just asked me 10 minutes ago/I don't have any spare change/Only to make a phone call?/Only to make a fucking phone call?!\" Substance use and abuse is another common topic with \"Over Again\" (One more line and it's over again/Just another pill and it's over again), \"Casual Drinker\" (It's a career/Cheque or savings), \"Meth\" (Crystal methamphetamine/In my eyes and in my dreams) and \"Yum Yum Yum\" (I'm hungry/No money/Junkies and scum). Gambling addiction is also tackled in \"Punt\". Strangely, this whole downer and depressing assault on one's sense is brought up a notch by the silly antics apparent on album closer \"Birthday\".\n\nHaving supposedly already written the follow up album to 'Aloha' and from hearing those tracks in a live setting, I can already see the progression in songwriting by Cuntz. No doubt, once the second LP is released and comparisons to Total Control are made, folk will be scrambling to find a copy of this debut, but at just 300 vinyl copies pressed, I imagine those will be long gone...\" - user snapstruly (rateyourmusic.com)\n\n1.Â Â Homeless 02:57Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Casual Drinker 01:48Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Over Again 01:45Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Lost 03:44Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Meth 02:35Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Yum Yum Yum 01:43Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Hip Hop 03:32Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Punt 04:40Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Hoonin' 01:19Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Insect Woman 03:16Â Â Â Â Â Â 11.Â Â Mum 07:27Â Â Â Â Â Â 12.Â Â Birthday 01:26\n\nAloha Cuntz Permanent Records RSD Exclusive 300\n\nThe Cure\n\nKiss me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nFormat: 12\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Rhino\n\nQuantity: 3200\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\n2 LP Red Vinyl, Numbered.

As avid Wu-Tang fans, not only were the band leaders thrilled with the opportunity, but Michels found that the âCinematic Soulâ sound was consistent with the moods of RZAâs gritty soundscapes on the classic Wu-Tang releases. The concert was such as success, El Michels Affair went on to play several more concerts nationwide backing Raekwon and other members of the Clan, and the shows led to the recording of two smash 7â singles featuring instrumental reinterpretations of the Wu-Tang classic songs âC.R.E.A.M.â and âBring Da Ruckus.â The singles combined to sell an extraordinary amount of over 7,000 units worldwide, and their success led to a contract in 2007 with indie hip hop powerhouse Fat Beats Records to record an entire album of Wu-Tang Clan interpolations entitled Enter the 37th Chamber.\"Â\n\n1.

To celebrate the forthcoming release of the first three solo albums by 13th Floor Elevators man Roky Erickson, thereâs a faithful reissue of the snarling Mine Mine Mind 7\", remastered from the original tapes.\n\nPresented in an exclusive, hand-numbered edition, the single comes in an exact reproduction of the original picture sleeve and is pressed on psychedelic swirl vinyl, exactly as it should be.\n\nErickson was just 15 when he wrote âYouâre Gonna Miss Meâ, the song that epitomized the garage rock movement and inspired punks, rockers and noisemakers ever since. In another life, Erickson and his Austin-based band could have been as big as any of the â60s legends still making music today. But life took Erickson down a meandering path.\n\nIndeed, he wound up writing âMine Mine Mindâ on his release from the Houston psychiatric hospital where he was institutionalized for almost a decade following a diagnosis with paranoid schizophrenia in 1968.\n\nEricksonâs experiences in the hospital proved to be fertile inspiration for his music â on leaving, he formed the group Roky Erickson and The Aliens and channelled his experiences into the 1980 album The Evil One, from which âMine Mine Mindâ, with its disturbed lyrics about âgoblins, demons and gremlinsâ, and B-side âBloody Hammerâ, is taken.\n\nIn the coming year, Light In The Attic will release a number of Ericksonâs early solo masterworks, all expanded and lavishly packaged on CD, LP & Digital. Beginning with The Evil One, holding a lens to this unique artist beloved of Sonic Youth, Spacemen 3, Jack White and many more.\n\n1. Mine, Mine, Mind\n\n2.

A deal with Twin/Tone was thought to be in the bag but was derailed by the fall 1980 signing of the Replacementsâ HuÌsker DuÌâs then-chief rival. Spurned on by Twin/Toneâs rejection, a scathing version of âAmusementâ was thrashed out live at Duffyâs, and plans were made for a four song 10â, with Blackberry Way cuts âStatues,â âWriterâs Cramp,â and âLetâs Go Dieâ making up the balance. The enormous start up cost for a debut release forced a format change, and in January of 1981 Reflex Records #A, âAmusementâ b/w âStatues,â found its way to market. The single would find two pressings over the next few years, but fall out of print as the bandâs style changed from Metal Box-esque post-punk to Los Angeles-inspired hardcore.\n\nFor Record Store Day 2013, Numero will issue âAmusementâ b/w âStatuesâ and the studio alternates âWriterâs Crampâ and âLetâs Go Dieâ as a 2x7â. The Blackberry Way cuts have been remastered from a first generation sub-master (the originals have long been lost), while âAmusementâ was cut from the original live board tape. Grant Hartâs Fake Name Graphix artwork remains untouched, beefed up by a 28pt board gatefold jacket. Pressed in an edition of 4000, this deluxe reissue should satiate a new generation of HuÌsker lovers. For at least another 33 years, anyhow.\n\nAmusement\n\nStatues\n\nWriterâs Cramp\n\nLetâs Go Die\n\nAmusement Husker Du Husker Du Numero Group 7\" Vinyl RSD Exclusive 2700\n\nImagine Dragons\n\nLive at Independent Records\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nFormat: CD\n\nLabel: Interscope Geffen\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\nImagine Dragons live at a record store!--Independent Records in Colorado\n\nLive at Independent Records Imagine Dragons Imagine Dragons Interscope Geffen CD RSD Exclusive\n\nInvisible Hands\n\nInsect Dilemma/Disallowed 7\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 4/20/2013\n\nFormat: 7\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Abduction\n\nQuantity: 300\n\nRelease type: RSD Exclusive\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThis is the brand new project of Alvarius B.
