THOUGH Cory Doctorow's first novel takes place in Florida, its amiable, laid-back utopia creates a distinctly California mood. We begin ''sometime late-XXI'' after the rise of the ''Bitchun Society.'' There is no more death, just a voluntary hibernation called ''deadheading,'' and money has gone the way of ''Whuffie,'' your level of public capital or good will. Disney World is run by ''ad-hocracy,'' loose organizations of young people with cellphones implanted in their inner ears and networked PC's wired to their brains. These ''castmembers'' work together to improve the park through new technologies and feel-good crowd management. One character, Keep A-Movin' Dan, describes the vibe of the new social order: ''We can't remember what it was like to work to earn our keep; to worry that there might not be enough, that we might get sick or get hit by a bus.'' Doctorow may be writing science fiction, but I'd call this San Francisco circa 1999.
