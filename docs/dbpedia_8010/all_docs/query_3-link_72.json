        "text": "1. Cory Doctorow was born in Canada but obtained dual citizenship with the United Kingdom in 2011. He is known for his championing of digital rights and open-source technologies.\n\n2. Despite being a science fiction writer known for his tech-savviness, Doctorow has never owned a mobile phone or had a social media presence. He believes in the importance of privacy and has expressed concerns about the effects of technology on society.\n\n3. Doctorow has been a strong advocate for copyright reform and has released many of his own books under Creative Commons licenses, allowing others to freely distribute, remix, and adapt his work. This unique approach to intellectual property has contributed to his popularity and influence in the digital rights movement.\n\n4. In addition to writing, Doctorow is also an accomplished activist and blogger. He co-founded the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and served as its European Affairs Coordinator for several years. He frequently writes about issues related to digital rights, privacy, and copyright reform on his popular blog, boingboing.net."
