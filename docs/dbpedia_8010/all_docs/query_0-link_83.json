        "text": "im just reading james patterson marymary and theres a few pages init where they go to disneyland park and then back to disneyland hotel, and i got me thinking are there any books with wdw in it.it was quite fun reading it. i dont mean factual books theres prob thousands of them, but and storys set in or around 'the world'\n\nKingdom Keepers is supposed to be the first of a series, from what I understand. Ridley has been working with humourist Dave Barry on Peter Pan stories as well - one story about how Peter became the Pan was very cool.\n\nDown and Out is an excellent story. The whole concept of popularity as currency was rather forward looking if you think about MySpace and Facebook. Also, thinking of pseudo-political groups managing the parks...personally I loved it.\n\nPlus, do a Google on Walt Disney World + Fanfic to get some neat stories. Here's one link to a source http://www.fanfiction.net/c2/25503/3/0/1/\n\nI like the fanfic concept since I've written some myself, although I should get around to posting it on the web. One concept surrounded WDW actually being a nexus to alternate dimensions with the portals being located in the attractions. It sprung from my 'geekier' days from long ago (20 years) when I still played D&D. One series of adventures in a campaign found the characters chasing some bad guys through a portal, only to end up in WDW. Unfortunately for the guests, most of the CBR was burned to the ground in a spell fight...\n\nI know a couple of kids books!\n\nOne is \"The Mystery at Walt Disney World\" by Carol Marsh. It's a whole series of mystery books for kids all set in different locations. One is at Disney World and my dd loved it!\n\nWe also had a Mary Kate and Ashley book at Disney World - lol!! I don't remembe the exact title. This was in their younger days and it's a big book with tons of great full photo pictures.\n\nAlthough it has been previosly mentioned, I also recommend Kingdom Keepers. It is really neat and after reading it, you just wonder, could/does it really happen?\n\nAlso, the two Peter Pan books (Peter and the Starcathers #1, and Peter and the Shadow thieves #2) by Barry and Pearson are really good. They are not set in any Disney parks, but it answers any questions you might have had about Peter Pan and his friends."
