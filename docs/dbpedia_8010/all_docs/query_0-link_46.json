Signed by author Cory Doctorow on its title page with a charming inscription: \"For Erik -- People who bought this book also bought clean underwear\". This book and its dust jacket are in fine condition. Its binding is tight and square, with no spine crease. Covers are unmarked and unworn, with bright metallic green titles on its spine. Pages are unworn and -- other than the author's inscription -- unmarked. Not a remainder. Its dust jacket, now protected by a removable mylar cover, is whole, bright, unmarked, and unworn. I will ship this book in a moisture proof zip-loc bag, padded in bubble wrap, inside a sturdy box to assure it reaches its new owner in the same condition as my description. - Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom [SIGNED]",

        "text": "\"He sparkles! He fizzes! He does backflips and breaks the furniture! Science fiction needs Cory Doctorow.\"\n\n--Bruce Sterling, author of The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction\n\nOn The Skids In The Transhuman Future\n\nJules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and compose three symphonies...and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.\n\nDisney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth century. Now in the keeping of a network of \"ad-hocs\" who keep the classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only the smallest high-tech touches.\n\nNow, though, the \"ad hocs\" are under attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself.\n\nWorse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war...."
