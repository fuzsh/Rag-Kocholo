        "text": "The prophetic debut novel from the visionary author fo LITTLE BROTHER, now published for the first time in the UK.\n\nJules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and compose three symphonies ... and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.\n\nDisney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth century. Now overseen by a network of 'ad hocs' who keep the classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only the smallest high-tech touches.\n\nBut the ad hocs are under attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of Presidents and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself.\n\nWorse: it appears that this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival after all.) Now it's war.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nCanadian-born Cory Doctorow is the author of the New York Times bestselling novel Little Brother. He has won the Locus Award for his fiction three times, been nominated for both the Hugo and the Nebula, and is the only author to have won both the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the Campbell Award for best SF Novel of the Year. He is the co-editor of BoingBoing.net, writes columns for Make, Information Week, the Guardian online and Locus and has been named one of the internet's top 25 influencers by Forbes magazine and a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. Cory Doctorow lives in London with his wife and daughter.\n\nReviews\n\nPraise for DOWN AND OUT IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM:\n\n'Impressively imagined' New York Times\n\n'Cory Doctorow doesn't just write about the future - I think he lives there.'

Bruce Sterling\n\nPraise for Cory Doctorow:\n\n'Fresh and full of thought-provoking ideas, a book about tomorrow that demands to be read now.' The Times\n\n'I'd recommend 'Little Brother' over pretty much any book I've read this year. Because I think it'll change lives. It's a wonderful, important book' Neil Gaiman\n\n'A glorious book unlike any book you've ever read' Gene Wolfe\n\n'A cracking read' Guardian\n\n'Doctorow brilliantly shows us a near-future that's equally wondrous, inspiring and terrifying' BBC Focus\n\nBook Information\n\nISBN 9780007327935\n\nAuthor Cory Doctorow\n\nFormat Paperback\n\nPage Count 208\n\nImprint HarperVoyager\n\nPublisher HarperCollins Publishers\n\nWeight(grams) 150g\n\nDimensions(mm) 198mm * 129mm * 13mm"
