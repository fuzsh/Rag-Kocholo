        "text": "Kurt Schiller\n\nGod, if one is to believe fictional renegade AIs, is a dream of good government. If that’s true, then Cory Doctorow’s 2023 novel The Lost Cause may well be its gospel: an exhaustive and often frustrating paean to liberal democracy and well-run institutions.\n\nThis is a novel where packed council meetings and circuit court hearings are pivotal plot points; where social media arguments and DSA Slack channels take on great tactical significance; and where clever urban planning in the face of climate change becomes a practically Messianic movement. Its heroes recall both Occupy Wall Street and Sixties counterculture; its villains feel ripped from Twitter circa 2020. To call it “very online” would be an understatement.\n\nIn a practical sense, The Lost Cause is part near-future climate thriller, part cyberpunk-lite adventure, and part young adult romance. It follows 19-year-old Burbank resident and recent graduate Brooks Pallazzo, who struggles to find his way through a polycrisis of climate change, economic collapse, and cultural transformation. The novel is set in the mid-2030s, in the wake of back-to-back progressive presidents who implemented a far-reaching version of the Green New Deal along with immigration and housing reform, a jobs guarantee, and a slate of other progressive policy dreams. Unfortunately, a newly elected conservative president (a barely disguised Trump analog) and a backlash from the remnants of the American far-right threaten to undo it completely.\n\nAccompanying Brooks through a largely slice-of-life plot is a diverse group of upbeat, politically engaged teens and young adults—the “first generation in a century that doesn’t fear the future,” as the book repeatedly tells us. They spend their days doing government-assigned gig work and eating lavishly described home-cooked food; one day they’re helping out an elderly neighbor, the next they’re shoring up sea walls with specially engineered hydrophilic sandbags. These vignettes of near-future daily life are realistically and believably rendered, but their preponderance makes the novel feel aimless and at-times repetitive—a quality it never quite manages to shake, even once an actual plot arrives in the third act.\n\nWhile Brooks and his friends charge headlong into a difficult but still-hopeful future, the forces of the old world—well-meaning but foot-dragging bureaucrats, offshore crypto moguls, and old-fashioned MAGA grampas with rusty AR-15s and dogeared copies of conservative sci-fi novels—threaten to drag it back down into chaos and decay. They slow-roll essential aid to climate refugees, destroy housing projects and green technology, and file court injunctions against important climate infrastructure; combating these efforts provides the majority of the novel’s plot and forward momentum.\n\nThe Lost Cause has been called both an eco-thriller and an example of “solarpunk”— exciting eco-tech is the key to thwarting a violent conservative uprising funded by the world’s remaining billionaires—and it is indeed filled with glimpses of interesting eco-technology, including carbon-neutral pre-fab housing and 3D-printed biodegradable packaging. Unfortunately, few of these ideas get more than a brief description before they vanish without a trace, never to return.\n\nThe same is true of the novel’s near-future society. It’s revealed, for instance, that all children are taught mindfulness exercises to help them avoid excessive smartphone and social media use, an interesting idea that unfortunately goes unexplored and underutilized. The situation isn’t helped by Doctorow’s bone-dry prose and YA-inflected dialogue; the most evocative portion of The Lost Cause is its brief afterword, in which Doctorow describes writing beneath a red-stained and fire-scorched sky, as ashes fell tremblingly around him. It’s unfortunate such surreal and powerful imagery is largely absent from the novel itself.\n\nThe real hero of The Lost Cause is not Brooks’ gang of peppy Gen Alphas, but the transformative power of liberal democracy and radical (but not too radical) progressivism. Most plot points are resolved not by character action, but by bureaucratic shifts that play out in council meetings, court hearings, and livestreams. Long stretches of the book also consist of political lectures to various theoretical audiences: for the disengaged, there are speeches about getting involved and making a difference; for cringing environmentalists, there’s a scene where weaponized environmental impact studies delay critical infrastructure projects; and, for NIMBYs, a sequence in which a city councilperson is literally moved to tears by the splendor of an urban planning proposal.\n\n(Tellingly, there are no fewer than three lectures about the futility of violent resistance to fascism—culminating in a truly unbelievable scene where a hostage situation with armed Nazis is resolved by running away and waiting for the police to show up. This, despite the novel’s repeated criticisms of police complicity and racism.)\n\nThis late turn into thudding, leaden didacticism is unfortunate, but it also seems pointedly intentional. The idea of fiction as a blueprint for the future is a common theme throughout—whether it’s the MAGA remnants’ fixation on the books of Robert Heinlein, the tongue-in-cheek evocation of Snow Crash’s floating anarcho-capitalist paradise, or an in-universe Atlas Shrugged knockoff that turns out to be a literal handbook for fascist counter-revolution. It’s hard not to come away thinking Doctorow explicitly set out to write his own handbook for an onrushing future (a sentiment he more-or-less confirms in the afterward).\n\nAnd the success of that exercise? As a handbook, The Lost Cause is both promising and deeply frustrating. Promising, because many of The Lost Cause’s constituent parts—such as its insistence on direct action in the face of government inadequacy—are sincere, thoughtful, and even inspiring; and frustrating, because the book’s political sentiments feel less like a reflection of reality than of the author’s own personal hang-ups and unfinished social media arguments.\n\nIn the end, it’s unlikely that The Lost Cause will win many fans not already converted to its vision of technocratic progressivism, and fully unpacking its confused if well-meaning ideology would take far more space than is available here. But as messages for the future go, you could do a lot worse than “stop posting and start doing something about it.”\n\nWhatever the novel’s other shortcomings, here’s hoping that we do just that.\n\nKurt Schiller is a Pennsylvania-based writer and editor. He is the editor in chief of Blood Knife magazine and co-host of Podside Picnic, a podcast dedicated to the literature of the fantastic.\n\nTransparency Statement\n\nThis article was commissioned by an emailed pitch from ARB’s calls for reviews and essays.
