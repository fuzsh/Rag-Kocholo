        "text": "by Steven Shaviro\n\nCory Doctorow is an Internet celebrity. As outreach coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, he's done important work defending open Net access, and online freedom of expression, against both government and corporate interference. He is also co-editor of the blog Boing Boing, one of the most entertaining and informative sites on the web, updated daily with reports on everything from cool new gadgets to truly demented performance art.\n\nBut in his science-fiction novel Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, Doctorow takes a sly, sideways look at the promises and problems of network culture. Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom envisions a future world in which many of the last decade's utopian fantasies about bio-, nano-, and digital technology have literally come true. The Bitchun Society (as it is called, presumably after that rancid bit of surfer slang, bitchin') is a post-scarcity world. Since all material goods are available in abundance, there is no mandatory work, and no money. Since the network is direct-wired into every- body's brain, there is instant communication and easy access to information. In the absence of money, wealth or prestige is measured in Whuffie, which is something like a weighted average of your reputation among your peers. (Think of a more advanced version of the system on eBay where buyers and sellers rate one another.) Everyone is always evaluating everyone else, and the results are continually updated in real time.\n\nEven death has been overcome, because people can back up their memories at regular intervals, and download them as needed into newly cloned bodies. If you die, or get sick or injured, or even if you are just feeling a bit worn down, you can have yourself cloned and restored from the last backup. And if you're bored, or really tired of your life, you can \"deadhead,\" or go into deep storage for a while, with the assurance of being revived again whenever you want.\n\nOne problem with utopias is that they can be boring, both to read about and to actually live in. Doctorow is aware of this danger, and he makes it one of the themes of the book. This is why the novel is set, as its title implies, in Disney World. The Bitchun Society covers the entire globe; but Disney World is an especially important place, because it is taken to be a pinnacle of artistic achievement, perhaps even the greatest accomplishment of the human spirit. In a world of plenitude, where everything comes easily, people have an insatiable appetite for simulation rides and games. There isn't really that much else to do. Disney World is always \"jammed with happy guests, bright and cheerful and ready for a day of steady, hypermediated fun.\" Julius, the narrator, goes further, choosing to live in Disney World, full time. He's a \"castmember,\" also known as an \"ad-hoc,\" spending his days as a volunteer caretaker at the Haunted Mansion.\n\nDoctorow doesn't undermine this adulation of Disney World with cheap irony. Rather, he presents it entirely on its own terms. The novel itself can't really be called ironic; instead, it is permeated by a deadpan, slightly creepy sense of effusive sincerity. The characters are all \"twittering, Pollyannic\" people. They display a sort of dampened affect: a distant, impersonal warmth, unburdened by any hint of anxiety, let alone tragedy. They \"can't help but be friendly\"; they have a \"look of chirpy helpfulness at their instant disposal.\" Sometimes the older folks, who still remember the pre- Bitchun world of scarcity and work, complain that the younger generation lacks fire and passion. But this crit-icism is simply unintelligible to those who have grown up with the Bitchun Society, and spent their entire lives in Disney World.\n\nNone of this means, however, that the Bitchun Society is free of deviousness and conflict. There may be no fighting over food or money, but people still rub each other the wrong way, and the competition for Whuffie gets quite nasty at times. The plot of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom concerns the narrator's dispute with the other ad-hocs about upgrading the rides in Disney World. Julius wants to keep the Disney imagineers' original vision intact; the others want to replace it with the latest virtual technology. Doctorow pulls off the unlikely feat of making this dispute compelling. It doesn't hurt that things go consistently wrong for Julius throughout the book. The fact that he is murdered early on is the least of his problems. That's no big deal, since he is immediately revived from a backup. But then his girlfriend dumps him, his best friend betrays him in numerous ways, and---worst of all--he finds himself slipping offline, as a result of faulty hardware.\n\nThe Bitchun Society is not perfect, then. It has gotten rid of things like \"dying, starving, freezing, broiling, killing, cruelty and ignorance and pain and misery.\" In their place, it has created a PG-13, Disneyfied world, filled with people who cannot imagine anything different. Doctorow refuses to make a facile judgment, either way, as to whether the gain in pleasure, security, and comfort is worth the loss of intense feeling. In any case, even without real trauma, there's still plenty of room for complaint. In the Bitchun Society, people still get bored and frus- trated, feel the need to change their lives, and sometimes even decide just to check out of it all.\n\nFuturistic speculation is often caught between opposing extremes. Either the future will be more marvelous than we can possibly imagine, or else it will be a nightmarish horror. Doctorow has written a new sort of futuristic narrative, one that eschews both utopia and dystopia, and settles instead for a wry account of everyday life, under circumstances that may well be extraordinary for us, but are merely banal for the people who live among them."
