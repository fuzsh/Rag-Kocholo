        "text": "Where to live\n\nWhere to live\n\nAmsterdam Neighbourhood: the peaceful Plantage\n\nThe Plantage, the ‘cultural garden of Amsterdam’, is an easy-to-access, quiet residential area located in the heart of the city; however, it also offers a peaceful and relaxing place surrounded by nature and greenery.\n\nIt’s just a 15 minute walk from Central Station but a whole world away from the hustle and bustle of the vibrant city centre. No wonder the Plantage (or East Canal) district is considered by locals and visitors alike to be one of the best neighbourhoods in Amsterdam right now. Hop on a bike or head out for a casual stroll and you’ll find museums, parks, bars and restaurants along the many canals that crisscross the area.\n\nThings to see and do\n\nFor the perfect place to chill-out, hop over the canal to Hortus Bontanicus – one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world. Wander through the desert and jungle environments that stretch throughout the magnificent glasshouses. Flutter with butterflies or stroll around superb gardens – which once provided the locals with medicinal herbs – before finishing off with your own choice of pick-me-up at the café’s sunny terrace. If fauna is more your thing (although there’s no reason you can’t do both) then head over to the Artis Royal Zoo. This impressive zoological garden dates back to 1838 and gives you the opportunity to say “hallo” to a wide variety of animals from all around the world. Attached to the zoo you’ll find Micropia, which offers a totally fascinating insight into microbes and their impact on our daily lives. Sure, a museum about microbes is a hard thing to sell – but take our word for it, it really is worth a visit! To enjoy an afternoon of iconic culture, walk (or cycle, or take a boat) down the Nieuwe Keiszersgracht canal to the world famous Hermitage Gallery’s Dutch outpost. With a combination of permanent and temporary exhibitions from the main St Petersburg collection, its a varied and interesting museum that is completely manageable in size – not too big or daunting but still with a large enough treasure trove of art pieces to inspire you.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tropenmuseum is an entirely different experience – a mixture of anthropological exhibits from every corner of the world, with something of interest for everyone. The\n\nTropenmuseum is located next to the beautiful Oosterpark, Amsterdam’s first large scale public park dating back to the 1890s, which was recently renovated. Check out the sculpture park, which holds many world-renowned pieces – or just hang out in this peaceful green space among the enchanting wildlife. More traditional culture is on your doorstep at the Dutch National Opera and Ballet. Home to the Dutch National Opera and Dutch National Ballet, this Cees Dam and Wilhelm Holzbauer-designed building also houses Amsterdam’s city hall. Behind it you’ll find the world famous Waterlooplein Flea Market, a colourful collection of stalls selling everything under the sun, the perfect place to go if you want to find classic Dutch souvenirs.\n\nPlaces to eat and drink\n\nFeeling hungry or thirsty? You won’t be disappointed. Ten minutes away you’ll find De Groene Olifant which is a tiny bar with bags of character. Cosy and old fashioned on the inside, it also has a great terrace for relaxing on a summer’s day. If you’re feeling adventurous you can always jump on a number 10 tram and head up to Brouwerij ’t IJ for a real Dutch treat: a local brewery with its very own windmill. Or head west over the famous Skinny Bridge (Magere Brug) to Onder de Ooievaar, a traditional Dutch bar right on the Prinsengracht canal.\n\nFood-wise, try the intimate atmosphere and amazing tastes at Elkaar near the Tropenmuseum, or wander over to Noara’s for an Arabic food journey with hints of French cuisine thrown in. Other great dining options are right by the zoo: De Plantage is an elegant affair in spectacular surroundings while Tempura is a great Japanese restaurant with similarly affordable prices. Burgermeester is also in the district if you fancy a juicy organic burger, and Pizzabakkers has the best pizzas this side of Italy.\n\nGetting around\n\nYou can easily walk to and from Amsterdam Central Station, but there are many other transportation options if you prefer.\n\nCycling is probably the best way to get around and fit in with the locals – although not for the faint-hearted – and it’s very easy to rent bikes in Amsterdam (one of the cheapest options is to get an OV bike).\n\nThe closest tram stops are at Artis, Plantage Lepellaan and Weesperplein, for tram lines numbers 9, 10 and 14.\n\nThe nearest metro stations are Waterlooplein and Weesperplein, where you can catch metro lines 51, 53 or 54.\n\nThree great reasons to move to Eindhoven\n\nMany expats pick Amsterdam when they have a choice of where to move in the Netherlands, but there are other great cities to explore, and Eindhoven is one of them, with such great advantages as a thriving tech scene, a relaxed atmosphere, and a lower cost of living.\n\nEindhoven, affectionately known as Lichtstad (‘City of Light’), is the home of globally famous electronics giant Philips. It is a city steeped in industrial heritage yet successfully re-invented as a technology, R&D and design hub: an entrepreneur’s paradise. And now, for an increasing number of expatriates, a place to call home.\n\nExpat Mortgages, which specialises in securing home financing for expats in the Netherlands and beyond, explains why this innovative south-eastern city is a smart alternative to Amsterdam.\n\nTech transformation\n\nThe Netherlands’ fifth largest city — with a population of roughly 220,000 — may be synonymous with Philips, but today it is a shining example of innovation and design, attracting skilled people from around the world into a knowledge ecosystem which the city itself calls Brainport. Forbes magazine has described Eindhoven as “hands down the most inventive city in the world”, while Fortune has boldly suggested that “the next Silicon Valley could well be in Eindhoven”.\n\nIt’s clearly an exciting time to be in the capital of North Brabant province. For one, the economy is in good shape: according to Statistics Netherlands, the 3.6% growth it experienced in 2016 was above the national average, with strong performance in hi-tech industries, manufacturing and commercial services creating high-quality jobs. No place in the country matched Eindhoven’s 1.3% fall in unemployment in 2016, leading North Brabant province’s Social Economic Council to warn of potential skills shortages.\n\nLife and liveability in Eindhoven\n\n“Eindhoven has a relaxed vibe and the people are really friendly”, says Roy Schreurs from Expat Mortgages, which just opened an office in Eindhoven. “The city offers an enviable quality of life, just minutes away from Belgium and Germany ” While Amsterdam’s infrastructure groans under the weight of soaring demand and its public areas teem with crowds, Eindhoven’s residents enjoy more green space than any other Dutch city. And what the compact Eindhoven city centre lacks in historic architectural grandeur, it more than makes up for in edgy modern aesthetics, and an easily accessible (and affordable) arts, culture, entertainment and leisure scene. “It’s a very welcoming and familiar city for expats”, adds Roy, who says that with about one-third of the city’s population being foreign, you’re as likely to hear English spoken on the streets of cosmopolitan Eindhoven as you are the rich Brabantian dialect. Multinational corporations, sought-after schools for third-culture kids, a world-class technical university and globally-renowned design academy create a true melting pot.\n\nAn affordable alternative to Amsterdam\n\nThe Eindhoven cost of living is also easier on the pocket than Amsterdam. Numbeo’s recent Cost of Living Plus Rent Index states that “you would need around €3,519.67 in Eindhoven to maintain the same standard of life that you can have with €4,500 in Amsterdam.” Notably, it points out that local purchasing power in Eindhoven is 22.28% higher than in Amsterdam.\n\nThe housing market in the Netherlands reflects this. Many expats are now being priced out of the “overheated” capital, with housing shortages that mainly affect Amsterdam and Utrecht. The Dutch government has encouraged locals and expats in Amsterdam to consider surrounding cities rather than stay in an already-crowded market; living in Eindhoven is an enticing solution. For Eindhoven, the upside potential of this shift for those prepared to buy property is already happening. In a 2017 market review, De Nederlandsche Bank stated that, like their larger cousins, medium-sized cities are “witnessing stronger house price rises than the rest of the Netherlands.”\n\nCompelling case for buying a house in Eindhoven\n\nFor many expats the dilemma remains: to buy or not to buy? There appears to be a consensus in the current market.\n\n“Of course it is a personal decision. But the mortgage interest deductions and the current low interest rates convince more and more expats to buy a property instead of renting”, says Roy of Expat Mortgages. Indeed, the numbers from Centraal Planbureau show that the average housing expenses of mid-income homeowners are about a fifth of their disposable income, while tenants spend a third of that income on rent. Roy adds that investing money in property is a much smarter financial bet than… just throwing it out the window on rent.\n\nFor expats who choose to take the plunge, Eindhoven’s diverse housing stock reflects its status as a regional urban centre.\n\nSingle people or couples without children often prefer city centre apartments close to all the amenities, but these inevitably attract a price premium. Families may opt for larger houses in the suburbs and villages skirting the city, which are seamlessly connected to the city for work and schools and within easy reach of the central train station, road networks and airport.\n\nThe decision often revolves around your budget, and the best way to determine your price range and navigate the practicalities of a mortgage application is to hire a dedicated mortgage adviser.\n\nAmsterdam it is not, but an increasing number of expats are being drawn to Eindhoven’s bright lights, much as Philips’ founders might have envisaged more than 125 years ago.\n\nWhy move to the north of the Netherlands\n\nThe northern Netherlands provinces of Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe offer a Dutch experience with a unique flavour and at a gentler pace. The region is growing thanks to recent investment, and there are many opportunities for expats interested in relocating to the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Welcome Center North (IWCN), a one-stop shop offering services, advice and events for expats in the northern Netherlands, explains why there has never been a better time to move to one of the top Dutch regions.\n\nJob opportunities in a growing region\n\nThe Dutch provinces in the north have seen immense growth and development over the last decade, and the region is one of the fastest growing parts of the country. Investment in the area has increased largely due to the Northern Netherlands Provinces alliance (Samenswerkingsverband Nord Nederland – SNN) which has attracted nearly EUR 1.5 billion of EU development funding since 2000. This in on top of more than EUR 1.2 billion of foreign investment (NOM Foreign Direct Investment) in new projects which has created thousands of new jobs.\n\nThese more rural provinces of the Netherlands have traditionally had a strong agricultural sector, but there are a number of other key growing industries including healthcare, energy, technology and life sciences. There are approximately 600 international companies operating in the northern Netherlands, including many Dutch and German multinationals as well as US giants such as IBM and Google.\n\nExpats looking for skilled work will find many opportunities, particularly in metropolitan areas. The city of Groningen – the capital of Groningen province – is the largest city in northern Netherlands with a research university and vast student population. Leeuwarden, with its ancient architectural delights, is the economic hub of Friesland. Assen, the capital of Drenthe, is the fastest-growing city in the region, with strong healthcare and service sectors.\n\nIf you’re a budding entrepreneur, there is a subsidy scheme in the region for people looking to start up small or medium-sized businesses. Citizens from EU/EFTA nations can move freely to the northern Netherlands to look for work. Those from outside the EU/EFTA will need to apply for the relevant work permit, like they would anywhere else in the country.\n\nStudy at one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands\n\nIf you’re looking to study in the Netherlands, the northern Dutch provinces boast one of the most reputable universities in the country. Founded in 1614, the University of Groningen is the second oldest university in the Netherlands and is currently the 80th ranked university in the world according to Times Higher Education. The university hosts over 30,000 students from 120 nationalities and is a distinguished research institution specialising in energy, healthy ageing and sustainable society.\n\nThere are also a number of universities of applied sciences that offer English-speaking higher education to expats, including the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen and the Stenden University of Applied Sciences with locations in Leeuwarden and Drenthe. If you’re after something part-time or less formal, all three Dutch provinces in the north offer distance learning through Open University and a wide range of courses through the Volksuniversiteit (folk university). A basic level of Dutch is usually needed for these, which can be learned at one of the many language schools in the area. Expats who want to enrol their children in English-speaking international schools have options at both primary and secondary school level, including the International School Eerde and the International School Groningen.\n\nA more relaxed lifestyle\n\nThe northern provinces of the Netherlands are known for being quieter, more sparsely populated and generally having a gentler pace of life than larger cities such as Amsterdam or Rotterdam, while still maintaining a high quality of life. This makes them ideal for expats wanting to escape the everyday hustle and bustle of the city while remaining within easy reach of it.\n\nBut that’s not to say there is not plenty to do in the north. Each province offers its own distinct Dutch experience. Friesland has the historic, culturally rich city of Leeuwarden, as well as five West Frisian Islands which can be reached by ferry or – during low tide of the Wadden Sea – by mudflat hiking. In exceptionally cold winter, the lakes of the province host the popular ‘Eleven Cities’ speed skating competition – though the last time this was able to be held was in 1997.\n\nThe city of Groningen, with its large student population, is known as the ‘metropolis of the north’, with a young, vibrant cultural and party scene. It was even found to have the most contented citizens in a EU study of 75 cities in 2007. Assen is home to the world-famous TT Circuit racing track, known as the ‘Cathedral of Motorcycling’ to sports fans. The northern Netherlands provinces offer high living standards, including low crime and pollution levels, at a lower price than other Dutch regions. The cost of living in Groningen is around 25 percent cheaper than in Amsterdam.\n\nSample the distinct culture of the top Dutch region of the north\n\nThe three northern Dutch provinces all pride themselves on having a distinct regional identity, different from what might be deemed typical of the country as a whole. It’s an area where old meets new, where many traditions are maintained but newcomers are welcomed, and where your word is sacred – one of the region’s most popular sayings is “een man een man, een woord een woord,” meaning that promises, once made, are kept. Nowhere is this more evident than in Friesland, with its own distinct language and sense of pride in its idiosyncratic outlook. In 2018, its capital Leeuwarden will attract more visitors than ever before as one of the year’s European Capitals of Culture.\n\nExpats new to the area will have no shortage of opportunities to immerse themselves in the local culture and environment, from the numerous local festivals and celebrations in each town, to sampling local delights such as poffert or beerenburg, to soaking up the village-like atmosphere of northern Netherlands city life.\n\nLiving in Laren: Netherlands’ historic gem\n\nJust outside Amsterdam are towns and villages that offer access to the big city without the noise and crowding, and with plenty of space for the kids – and one of the most beautiful is Laren.\n\nLaren, North Holland, may be small, but it has a big reputation – its tree-lined streets and historic charm are attractive to those who want to be close to Amsterdam but with a little more room to live with the children. Expatica explains why this little village has become one of the most coveted places to live outside Amsterdam for families.\n\nLaren: Netherlands’ close-knit community\n\nNestled in Het Gooi, a region in the Netherlands known for its gently rolling hills, greenery and majestic villas, Laren is a gem: its history as a farming village-turned-art colony has made it one of the coveted places to live outside Amsterdam. The village developed largely into a farming community, but the introduction of a tram line in the 19th century changed everything, as those who worked in Amsterdam could now travel.\n\nBut commuters weren’t the only ones coming to Laren in that time period. As the major cities of Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam industrialised, the artists saw their once pristine landscapes become brick and iron. Dutch painter Jozef Israëls, a member of the Hague School, discovered the area as a new place to paint – and soon, the area captivated even more artists. The Laren School gained such esteem that painters from across the world took notice. American painter William Henry Singer moved to Laren in the early 20th century and build a villa, then called De Wilde Zwanen (The Wild Swans); the villa was turned into the Singer Laren museum and concert hall, dedicated to preserving the Laren School and Singer’s art collection.\n\nLiving in Laren, NH for families\n\nSince then, Laren has become an affluent village known for its charming homes, spacious streets and friendly neighbours. Its location just outside Hilversum, Amsterdam and Utrecht make it ideal for those who work in one of the cities but don’t wish to downsize to cramped apartments, live on noisy streets and have little to no outside green space in which the kids can play. Though the three surrounding cities offer their own art, culture, education and nature, Laren may have them all beat – and all within a half-hour drive.\n\nArt and culture in Laren\n\nLaren has still held onto its roots as an art colony – as exemplified by the busy Singer Laren museum and numerous art organisations such as Kunst in Laren (Art in Laren), which present numerous art exhibitions each year. Besides the Singer Laren, the town also boasts the Geological Museum Hofland, which explores the earth’s history in an interactive way — perfect for children.\n\nMany events in Laren take place at the Singer Laren museum, but because the village atmosphere is close-knit and friendly, plenty of local annual events take place each year, such as the arrival of Sinterklaas. In the larger cities, these types of events are generally very crowded; in Laren, it’s like your own private event.\n\nEducation in Laren\n\nEducation is important in Laren. For such a small town, Laren boasts five primary schools, some of which focus on international mindedness; there are also two secondary schools, and one international secondary school. The Geological Museum Hofland often works with the schools in Laren to provide hands-on, entertaining educational outings and activities that allow the children to truly enjoy learning. With such commitment to education, the area becomes even more attractive for expat parents looking to raise their children in a small town but still maintain global perspectives.\n\nNature in Laren\n\nBeing in the centre of Het Gooi, there is no shortage of nature in Laren. The town is surrounded by nature reserves and forests, the closest by being the so-called Blukbos. Golf parks and country clubs also dot the area, providing a little bit more entertainment when admiring the nature — but a walk through the untouched woods can be a much-needed family adventure.\n\nFor such a small town, Laren has a lot going on in terms of art, culture, nature and beyond. A close-knit but private community, Laren offers expats the best of both: a small town with an international atmosphere.\n\nLiving and working in Twente\n\nIf you’re thinking of moving to the Netherlands for work, think about Twente: an entrepreneurial, high-tech region in the east of the Netherlands.

Additionally, the Netherlands has a reliable and effective train network, making it easy to commute from one town or city to another. This is particularly advantageous if you and your partner want to work or study in different cities. It’s not uncommon for students to live at home and travel the length of the country to attend lectures. Bicycles are welcome on most trains, although not at rush hour, and stations have extensive cycle parking. Travelling by car is typically fraught with expensive parking and often rare parking spaces.\n\nIf you’re looking for a home in Amsterdam itself, check out our article on where to live in Amsterdam and our guide to Amsterdam’s neighbourhoods.

Maastricht is a city with an international environment that combines top technology with high life-quality. It also has some of the best historic sites in the Netherlands, comprising the second highest number of heritage sites in the country, after Amsterdam.\n\nMaastricht is the capital city of the Dutch province of Limburg, and is well-connected to many main European cities: Aachen, Cologne, Frankfurt, Brussels, Antwerp, Paris, as well as cities in Luxemburg, are all nearby.\n\nIt’s a diverse and colourful city with great historical significance. Its impressive past is reflected in the picturesque historic centre and location along the Meuse river. The ancient but vibrant city of Maastricht remains a popular destination for the international community who come to the capital of Limburg for education and work.\n\nThe Maastricht University is the most international university in the Netherlands, with more than 45 percent students from abroad. In the hilly countryside new technologies on chemicals and new materials, life sciences and smart services are booming. The three Brightlands campuses in the region are at the heart of global innovation. Maastricht is also centered in the Euregio area, which incorporates a collection of towns in the Netherlands and Germany that facilitate cross-border cooperation and activities.\n\nThe main historical points\n\nMaastricht’s wealth of churches, mansions and treasure houses bear witness to its prosperous past, while the remains of the city walls and fortifications are relics of its more turbulent periods.\n\nArtifacts on view in the city’s Bonnefantenmuseum provide evidence of Roman occupation of Maastricht during the rule of Augustus Caesar in the 1st century AD. Some 2,000 years ago it was an important Roman outpost called ‘Mosae Trajectum’, implying that it lay at the junction of the river Maas with roads leading to other Roman settlements. Merchants, farmers and traders gathered at this point and business burgeoned.\n\nSt Servatius, a bishop from Belgium, moved to Maastricht in the fourth century to establish a Christian community in the city. His legacy remains obvious with the oldest church and bridge in the city being named after him.\n\nLater in the Middle Ages, the city became a trade centre prospering until the religious wars of the 16th and 17th century when the city was conquered and fell under the rule of the Spanish and later the French. Following secession in 1830 during the Belgian Revolution, Maastricht became the capital of Limburg, pledging loyalty to the Dutch kingdom under the reign of William I.\n\nMaastricht remained a neutral territory during the First World War, resulting in an influx of refugees to the city. For the next 40 years economic hardship hit the city, which also suffered under German occupation during WWII. Maastricht was also the birthplace of the Maastricht Treaty, which gave birth to the European Union and the euro currency.\n\nMaastricht today\n\nToday, Maastricht is a vibrant cultural, educational and political centre full of bon vivants. Ceramics, paper, beer and cement are its main products. Students from the six universities in the area add to the city’s vitality. The centre of Maastricht is declared a protected area, and walking is the best way to enjoy it.\n\nMaastricht is a popular destination for both local and foreign tourists. Churches, museums, parks, caves and ancient ruins ensure there is something for all interests. Maastricht also has a full calendar of festivals and events throughout the year including the colourful three-day Carnival held in February. The attractive city squares are perfect places for sampling café food and drinks, relaxing and taking in the gezelligheid of Maastricht.\n\nCombine Maastricht’s 20 centuries of history, art, culture, historic buildings and tradition with a lively international atmosphere, pavement cafés, good food and shopping and international education, and you’ll understand why the capital of Limburg is growing in popularity with expats.\n\nWhat language is that?\n\nAlthough Dutch remains the dominant language of the city, the local dialect, Limburgish, can still be heard. During the 18th century, French was the predominant language in the city, especially in upper class circles. The French influence remains evident in some street names within the old city centre. Nowadays, German is also widely spoken due to the proximity of Maastricht to the German border. Similarly, English is becoming more widely spoken, particularly in educational settings like Maastricht University where many courses are taught in the English language.\n\nGetting to the city\n\nMaastricht has its own airport referred to by locals as Beek, just 10km north of the city centre. Another seven airports can be reached in less than an hour by car. The main train station is close to the Centrum. The smaller station, Maastricht Randwyck, is close to the university and business district. High-speed trains stop in Maastricht en route to Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Cologne, London and Paris. In addition to regular bus services, visitors to Maastricht can travel by boat from Belgium and the rest of the Netherlands and arrive at Beatrixhaven.\n\nWhere to live in Maastricht\n\nCity Centre\n\nHistoric buildings dating back to the 17th century jostle with shops, cafes, restaurants and weekly markets in the centre of Maastricht. Vrijthof square is a beautiful place to sit and enjoy the surroundings, and on the right day, an open-air concert or event. Daily, hundreds of people visit Onze Lieve Vrouwebasiliek (the cathedral) and the exclusive stores located in the Stokstraatkwartier. Encompassing city walls, university buildings and the municipal park (Stadspark), the Jekerkwartier has an artistic slant that entices creative types and students.\n\nRight Bank\n\nAcross the river lies the old neighbourhood of Wyck, famous for specialty stores selling antiques, art and delicious food. Further south is the new district of Ceramique, previously a large industrial ceramic manufacturing area. Since 1995 the area has been developed into a modern residential, business and museum district, favoured by expats and locals wanting modern accommodation in an inner-city suburb with all amenities and services.\n\nBassin and Belvedere\n\nThe inner-city harbour, ‘t Bassin, is found on the northwest side of Maastricht and encompasses the districts of Bosscherveld, Lanakerveld, Front Quarter and some parts of Statenkwartier and Boschstraatkwartier. Since redevelopment started in 1999, this area has turned into a residential and commercial global village.\n\nSint Pieter and surroundings\n\nThis green residential area sits along Jeker valley and St Petersberg Hill, yet is still within walking distance to the city centre or into Belgium. The Sint Pietersberg tunnels – quarried into the marlstone to create underground shelter for protection against invasion by foreign forces – plus Marl Caves and St Pieter’s Fortare are all popular tourist attractions.\n\nCity limits and surroundings\n\nThere are spacious surrounding landscapes decorated with vineyards, orchards and the occasional restaurant and hotel. Golfing, water sports and outdoor recreational activities are plenty for those who enjoy an active life.\n\nFacts and links\n\n• Population:122,185 (www.maastricht.incijfers.nl)\n\n• International residents: 29 percent\n\n• Information about Maastricht: www.maastricht.nl, www.maastrichtregion.com\n\n• Information about Limburg: www.zuidlimburg.nl\n\n• International Schools: United World College (primary and secondary sections) www.uwcmaastricht.com\n\n• Expat Information: www.expatsinmaastricht.com\n\n• An infographic on the Maastricht/Limburg area\n\nGet an idea of Maastricht from the tourist office‘s video.\n\nWhere to live in Groningen\n\nDiscover historical Groningen, a vibrant university city in the north of the Netherlands that has one of the country’s youngest populations.\n\nHistorical Groningen is a vibrant university city in the north of the Netherlands. The many benefits of having the youngest population in the country includes a yearly programme of arts, culture and music that is enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.\n\nAn ancient history\n\nEstimates based on archaeological evidence from this region, dates human activity in the area as starting sometime between 3950-3720BC, although the first major settlement was established later in the third century AD. The city ‘villa Cruoninga’ is noted in the official records of 1040, making this city founded on the northernmost point of the Hondsrug region, an historical treasure.\n\nFrom early times, Groningen was an important trade centre in Northern Europe. A wall was constructed around the perimeters to protect the inhabitants and a local dialect was adopted as the dominant language.\n\nOver the following centuries, Groningen was ruled by the Spanish (during the Eighty Years War 1568-1648, also referred to as the Dutch War of Independence) before again regaining independence under the leadership of William of Orange; fought an attack from the Bishop of Munster and his forces during the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672); and had its city centre destroyed during the Battle of Groningen in the second World War (1945).\n\nModern times\n\nGroningen is situated close to the German border, which gives local industry easy accessibility to eastern and northern European countries. The over 9000 companies provide 123,000 jobs in the area. Organisations include the world’s largest sugar factory, CSM Vierverlaten; Hooghoudt (of jenever fame); Woolters-Noordhoff publishing house; Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil (each owning 50percent share in the largest natural gas fields in Western Europe).\n\nA centre for education\n\nImportant institutions for education, service provision and research the University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, and Hanze University of Applied Sciences (hogeschool) all attract international students as well as national.\n\nThe energy of youth\n\nWith a population over 190,000, Groningen is the seventh largest city in the Netherlands and the capital city in the north of the country. More than 60 percent of the inhabitants are under the age of 40, with 20 percent being students. Students often choose to continue enjoying what the city offers, by remaining in Groningen to work and raise their future families.\n\nArts & culture\n\nArt, culture and entertainment thrive in this environment. Groningen city centre boasts around 160 bars, cafés, open-air terraces and nightclubs with more liberal opening hours than Amsterdam. Many international bands consider Groningen a worthy venue to play during a European tour. Subsequently, the city is sometimes seen as a rock capital, especially as many local bands have launched a successful career from the annual Eurosonic or Noorderslag festival held in Groningen.\n\nOther attractions include the Museum of Groningen; Anatomical Museum; Northern Maritime Museum; Niemeijer Tobacco Museum; Natural History Museum; Gerardus van der Leeuw Anthropological Museum; Museum of Graphic Arts; and, the University Museum. Every August, the 11-day Noorderzon performing arts festival gives young talent, new productions and established performers a chance to showcase their work.\n\nGetting around\n\nGroningen has its own airport, 10 kilometres south of the city centre. Cheap flights to European cities are also available across the border from Bremen airport. Three train stations provide a regular service to most Dutch cities: Groningen, Groningen Noord, and Groningen Europapark. Qbuzz runs the inner and intercity bus transportation. By car, the journey to Amsterdam takes around 2.20 hours; or three hours to The Hague or Rotterdam. Driving to Germany means that you can be in Hamburg in three hours or Bremen within around two.\n\nHousing\n\nIn 2010, Groningen ranked second in an EU quality of life survey comparing 75 EU cities. Researchers collected data on the happiness of inhabitants in regards to subjects like transport, health and cultural facilities. The survey found that 60 percent of all journeys made in Groningen were by bicycle.\n\nWhere to live in Groningen\n\nCity Centre\n\nThe centre of Groningen (Centrum) is popular with students and young singles perhaps, most likely due to the proximity of shops, restaurants, cafes and bars.\n\nSchilderswijk and Zeeheldenbuurt\n\nHistorical area with 19th century buildings, close to the beautiful Noorderplantsoen park that is frequented by the locals, especially on sunny days. Mixed residential population, although again popular with students due to the nearby University. Slightly larger houses, some with gardens.\n\nOosterport\n\nHome to the popular theatre, De Oosterpoort, and a number of bars and cafes, this area is sought after by young professional couples and students. Historical buildings, including ‘schipperswoning’ or traditional Dutch fishermen houses are located in this neighbourhood.\n\nRivierenbuurt\n\nBehind Central Station and close to Stadspark (outside festival venue), this area has easy accessibility to Groningen Centrum. Favoured by students.\n\nKorrewegwijk and Indische Buurt\n\nTwo neighbourhoods that have merged to become one: Korrewegwijk. Cheap accommodation available in this diverse neighbourhood, with a strong Asian influence. A large discount supermarket is based here.\n\nOosterpark\n\nAnother diverse neighbourhood to the northeast of Centrum, old monuments and some cheaper accommodation available. Green areas around a popular park.\n\nVinkhuizen\n\nFurther out and offering larger homes with gardens, this area is popular with young couples and families. The Zernikecomplex is located here.\n\nSelwerd/Paddepoel\n\nTwo large, university apartment blocks for international students are located here. Also the ACLO sport complex.\n\nWijert/Beijum/Lewenborg\n\nA 20-minute bike ride from the Centrum, these residential areas are close to both natural and manmade recreational areas.\n\nFacts and Links\n\n• Population: 189,991 www.cbs.nl\n\n• Number of non-dutch: 39,326 www.cbs.nl\n\n• International Schools: International School Groningen – Primary Department at Groningse Schoolvereniging: www.g-s-v.nl, Secondary Department at St Maartens College: www.maartenscollege.nl\n\n• Online Magazine for University Students: www.groningenlife.nl\n\n• Local Council: www.gemeente.groningen.nl\n\n• Local Politics: www.politiekgroningen.nl\n\n• Neighborhood Information: www.groningenlife.nl\n\nWhere to live in Leeuwarden\n\nLeeuwarden offers an affordable and comfortable lifestyle in a beautiful old city surrounded by green spaces and waterways.\n\nLeeuwarden was founded along the shores of the Middelzee in the second century AD, and is around 2 hrs 20 minutes from Amsterdam by train, or 1.5 hours by car. Originally a farming centre, Leeuwarden enjoyed good trade relations until the 15th century when the waterway silted up, effectively stopping all trade by boat. In 1435, Leeuwarden was granted town-rights, becoming the capital city of the region in 1504. At this time the central government and jurisdiction settled here and the city became the residence of the Frisian stadtholders.\n\nModern Leeuwarden\n\nToday Leeuwarden is the administrative, economic, educational and cultural heart of Friesland (625,000 inhabitants), which has its own language: Stadsfries or Stadfries – a mixture of Hollandic dialect vocabulary and West Frisian grammar.\n\nThe city is the centre of local government; home to financial services (including Friesland Bank) and insurance companies (Achmea and Aegon); and has a growing creative industry based on ‘Serious Gaming’. Other important industries in the area include metal processing, water technology, and agricultural-nutritional business (Koninklijke Friesland Foods NV).\n\nLeeuwarden accommodates a number of highly respected universities of applied science (HBO) including the Noordelijke Hogeschool Leeuwarden, Van Hall Institute and Stenden University. There are also campuses for Wageningen University, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, and Universiteit Twente. With the inclusion of the two MBO schools, Friese Poort and Friesland College, Leeuwarden has a student population of over 30,000.\n\nThe famous Dutch 200km speed skating race (extremely cold weather permitting) Elfstedentocht starts and begins in Leeuwarden which is also the host city for the annual international domino festival.\n\nLocal celebrities\n\nThroughout the centuries Leeuwarden has been a source of intriguing characters in literature, science and politics.\n\nErotic dancer Mata Hari, who was controversially executed by the French in 1917 for allegedly spying for the Germans during the First World War, was a native of the city. Born Margaretha Zelle in Leeuwarden on 7 August 1876, the city has taken her to its heart and still campaigns for her exoneration, claiming she was wrongly convicted.\n\nOther notable locals range from Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972) one of the world’s most famous graphic artists – to the relatively unknown, Titia Bergsma, the first Western woman to be allowed into sealed-from-the-inside Japan. Ironically, she is more famous in Japan than in the Netherlands.\n\nHousing\n\nWith property prices considerably less than the Dutch national average, Leeuwarden is an ideal place for young families and first-time home-buyers. Friesland does not have such large expat communities as seen in the Randstad, so moving to the area may initially seem isolating. What makes the area enticing is more space at an affordable price in a child-friendly environment (with more than 40 primary schools) as well as the beautiful surrounding countryside.\n\nWhere to live in Leeuwarden\n\nCity Centre\n\nAs with many Dutch cities, Leeuwarden Centre has the charm of old homes set on old streets and canals. The centre has been renovated over the past 25 years, giving the city a cleaner, and more spacious feel. There are three cinemas, a beautiful library with a good selection of English books, and a plethora of bars, cafes and restaurants (although many are aimed at the student market). Naturally, living in the Centrum also increases your chances of English conversations while you are still learning the Dutch language.\n\nNorth\n\nThe northern suburbs offer easy proximity to most water-sport activities, especially sailing and rowing. Suburbs that are within two kilometers from the centre of Leeuwarden include the Liberty District (popular with students); Oldegalileën (homes from the 1930s, and residential mix of young and old); Rengerspark (includes a beautiful park, university campus and stately homes); Bloemenbuurt (diverse, colourful neighborhood with lovely 1930s houses); Transvaal (upmarket and desired area); and Boniface (expensive houses including large villas with gardens. Popular with families).\n\nEast\n\nAccording to estimates of property values (WOZ) in the east of Leeuwarden, there is a variation of almost 100 percent between the Indian neighbourhood (close to the Cambuur football Stadium, with a range of housing dating from the 1930s–1960s) and the suburb of Camminghaburen (spacious homes on large lots built in the 1980s and 1990s). Also upscale and close to the city centre is Orange District (Dutch mansions built around 100 years ago) and Tulpenburg (accommodation more suited to singles and couples, including some converted warehouses). Established, and less expensive areas with a full array of interesting services are Welgelegen and Zeeheldenbuurt.\n\nWest\n\nMany families choose to live in the western regions of Leeuwarden, especially in the more affluent areas of Helicon, Westeinde and Vosse Park. These areas offer spacious homes in green neighbourhoods. Similarly, Vogelwijk is a green residential area with homes dating back to the 1930s (for both the young and old). Singles prefer Sonnenborgh and students tend to find cheaper accommodation in the Valerius Quarter.\n\nSouth\n\nThe suburbs of Wielenpolle (long-stay Dutch residents), Julianepark (large 30s style houses popular with families) and Huizum (well-maintained houses and gardens close to the city centre) are sought after by first home buyers looking to settle down. If you are looking for a condominium with views, maybe head to the historical area of Nijlan (favoured by older residents). Further from the city centre are the districts of Zuiderburen which offer large, newer homes (waterside, so perfect if you need to park your boat nearby), and Techum (houses on large blocks – on what was previously an area of small farms).\n\nFacts and Links\n\n• Population: 94,838 www.cbs.nl\n\n• Non-Dutch residents: 16,503\n\n• Leeuwarden info: www.livingleeuwarden.nl\n\n• Friesland province info: www.fryslan.nl\n\nWhere to live in Haarlem\n\nHaarlem is a beautiful old city, close to the beach, and only 15 minutes by train from Amsterdam Central Station.\n\nHaarlem, the capital of the province of Noord Holland , has a population of over 150,000 inhabitants and is the thirteenth largest city in the Netherlands. Within the greater Haarlem area referred to as Kennemerland and including the neighbourhoods of Bloemendaal, Aerdenhout, Bentveld, Heemstede, Overveen, Sant-poort, and Schalkwijk, the population count increases to about 215,000.\n\nBeautiful and vibrant old city\n\nHaarlem, as the historical centre of the tulip bulb growing district, is also known as the Bloemenstad, translated as flower city. The Spaarne River winds its way through the city, which was once a port town exporting local chocolate, beer, linen and silk.\n\nFor the past 700 years, weekly markets have been held in the Grote Markt, in the foregrounds of the impressive cathedral, the Grote Kerk. Ten streets converge onto this central market place, and each street is worth wandering along just to look at the beautiful facades – often a mix of local homes, quaint shops, cafes, bars and restaurants. The Grote Markt hosts an assortment of music concerts and fairs throughout the year, and on any day is just a great place to relax over a drink and watch the world go by.\n\nActivities\n\nOn a sunny day, cycling the 25 minutes to the beach at Zandvoort or Bloemendaal aan Zee is popular. Walking, running and cycling in the dunes and local parklands are yearlong favourites. Haarlem hosts many sporting clubs with something for everyone including climbing walls, cricket, outside swimming pools and honkball. Both hockey and football fans are well catered for, with numerous clubs located within the area.\n\nArts and culture\n\nFor art and culture lovers, the Teylers museum is one of the oldest museums in the Netherlands with art, science and natural history exhibitions. Painting by the Dutch masters can be found at the Frans Hals museum, with more modern work located in De Hallen. Definitely worth a visit is Het Dolhuys – a museum for psychiatry, close to Central Station. Haarlem also hosts many music events including the annual Haarlem Jazzstad (jazz music festival), Haarlemhoutfestival (music and theatre) and Bevrijdingspop (May 5).\n\nGetting around\n\nHaarlem is relatively small for a Dutch city and is easy to navigate on foot or bicycle. To access the surrounding areas there are regular Connexxion bus services. Similarly taking the bus to Schipol and Amsterdam is generally faster and cheaper than going by car. The train service to Amsterdam leaves around every 10 minutes and will get you there in 15 minutes. There is a direct train service to Den Haag, Rotterdam, Leiden and Dordrecht. Local trains to Bloemendaal, Zandvoort, Heemstede-Aerdenhout leave regularly.\n\nWhere to live in and around Haarlem\n\nHaarlem offers varied accommodation and is more costly in the city centre. Living in the old city centre is popular, although houses tend to be smaller and less viable for families. Popular areas for families due to space and location of schools include Kleverparkbuurt, Leidesbuurt, Garenkokerskwartier, Bosch en Vaart, and Koninginnebuurt. The surrounding towns of Bloemendaal, Heemstede and Aerdenhout are also popular, although usually more pricey choices.\n\nIf you’re looking to buy a home or apartment in Haarlem, note that you’ll need to be a registered resident of the city for two years to buy accommodation that costs EUR 136,135 or less. Due to the cost of Haarlem properties, this is generally not a problem. Average rent for a three-bedroom apartment in the city centre is EUR 1450 per month, and median monthly disposable salary after tax is EUR 1800.\n\nHaarlem facts and links\n\n• Population: 151.841, including 25.7percent from foreign extraction\n\n• International Schools: International School Haarlem.

Since I spent a little more than five years in Amsterdam before moving here, it seems fitting to write a post comparing life experiences in the two cities.\n\nGetting around\n\nIn 2001, moving to Amsterdam from the Midwest was a huge culture shock in terms of transportation. I went from a car-loving culture to mastering the art of bike riding again. Once I got over the frequent crashes, I loved the freedom of biking instead of driving. And Amsterdam was the perfect size to get around on two wheels. Healthy, environmentally friendly, and fast – what a winning combination!\n\nIn Leiden, the bikes are plentiful. But since we live smack dab in the centre of a rather small village, I’ve discovered a new, even more convenient way to get around: walking! Like Amsterdam, everything is within 15 minutes from my front door, but now I just have to put on a pair of shoes and pop an umbrella in my purse. Sometimes I think I’ve been ruined for life in many places–especially if I insist on having everything within easy reach of home. Both cities provide a great quality of life. No getting behind the wheel every time I need anything.\n\nThe tourists\n\nI adore Amsterdam and always will. But I still grit my teeth when I remember the hordes of tourists that flooded its streets, especially in the summer. Fair weather days were an exercise in dodging map-toting individuals unfamiliar with the meaning of bike lanes. Even worse were the groups that hopped on rental bikes and clogged the roads with their rusty peddling skills.\n\nLeiden, I dare to argue, is just as beautiful as Amsterdam, but is strangely almost tourist free. I’m not sure how this charming city has stayed off the mainstream tourist circuit, but thus far it has.\n\nCultural offerings\n\nAmsterdam wins in terms of quantity of museums. World-famous offerings like the Anne Frank House and the Van Gogh Museum in a relatively short distance from each other? You can’t beat that. I’m also a regular visitor to Amsterdam for English-language cultural events, like through the John Adams Institute.\n\nLeiden does have its share of noteworthy museums, and even more than Amsterdam is a city structured around its world-famous university. The city is less international (though still very much so) and the expat community is thriving, but I do miss having a plethora of options like I had in Amsterdam. Not to mention a little more English in the air. Both cities are built around gorgeous canals, allowing for breathtaking scenery all year round and the option of boating through the city when the weather allows. I will admit the bar and restaurant scene is far superior in Amsterdam, though Leiden boasts its share of visit-worthy gastronomy. And nothing can beat the cosmopolitan vibe of Amsterdam. But it is just a half-hour train ride from Leiden. I may have found the best of both worlds.\n\nWhere to live in The Hague\n\nDen Haag is the third most populated Dutch city, and has a lively expat population due to a hoard of international organisations, schools and embassies.\n\nDen Haag is a mixture of modern skylines with a historic city centre, and the scenery and activities are as diverse as its mix of residents. Den Haag is the third most populated city in the Netherlands, the capital of South Holland, the seat of government, and home to the Dutch royal family.\n\nDen Haag’s history\n\nDen Haag is a multicultural, bureaucratic hub with four centuries of international integration.\n\nIt has grown as an outpost for most of the world’s human rights organisations including the International Court of Justice. Many embassies are based here and, with numerous international schools, it’s a comfortable place for relocation.\n\nIt’s also known as ‘s-Gravenhage (literally, the counts’ hedge), dating back to the 13th century when the Count of Holland’s hunting lodge was founded here. History, ritual and tradition play their part in this city, with terrific museums and cultural events.\n\nThe Hague today\n\nSmart areas nearby such as Rijswijk and Voorburg have a sprinkling of Michelin-starred restaurants, though Den Haag itself is most famous for Indonesian cuisine. Building development has been active in past years (www.wonenindenhaag.nl), and newly-built residential neighbourhoods on the city’s outskirts, such as Leidschenveen-Ypenburg and Wateringse Veld, are expected to be in demand as the city approaches some 520,000 residents in 2020.\n\nWhere to live in The Hague\n\nWassenaar\n\nThe gated villas of Wassenaar house diplomats and upmarket expats, as well as members of the House of Orange. This district is known by some as the Beverly Hills of the Netherlands, and it remains a favourite among expat families with large budgets for housing, situated in close proximity to several of the area’s international schools.\n\nArchipelbuurt/ Willemspark\n\nThis city centre area of beautiful 19th-century houses and apartments is full of character, with broad streets and big town houses and villas. This is embassy land and a top location where prices are premium and parking space problematic.\n\nStaten quartier/ Duinoord\n\nThis area has a similar feel to Archipel, with charming, spacious and elegant homes. Close to shops and cafes, it is a popular area. Typically smaller housing can be found in Duinoord, which also has a creative ambiance.\n\nBenoordenhout\n\nIt’s a green, quiet location but still close to motorway and other transport links with woodlands to the north and east. There are traditional, beautiful 1930s villas inhabited by wealthy older residents, and some single-family homes. Considering the space and environs, it is a good option for young families with children. Also in this area is Mariahoeve, which has the benefit of being on the train line and close to the British primary school.\n\nScheveningen\n\nIf you want something less genteel, head for the seaside town of Scheveningen with its casino on the beachfront (below) and long, sandy beach in either direction.\n\nDen Haag facts and links\n\n• Population: 515,880 (www.denhaag.buurtmonitor.nl)\n\n• International residents: 50.5 percent\n\n• International schools:\n\n• The American School of the Hague: www.ash.nl;\n\n• The British School in the Netherlands (BSN/IBDP): www.britishschool.nl;\n\n• Deutsche Internationale Schule: www.disdh.nl;\n\n• The European School of The Hague: www.eshthehague.nl;\n\n• Haagsche Schoolvereeniging, HSV (Dutch international primary school): www.hsvdenhaag.nl;\n\n• The International School of the Hague: www.ishthehague.nl;\n\n• Le Lycée Français Vincent van Gogh: www.lyceevangogh.nl;\n\n• Szkola Polska/Polish Embassy School in The Hague: www.spk-haga.nl;\n\n• Sekolah Indonesia/The Indonesian Embassy School in the Netherlands: www.sekolahindonesia.nl.\n\n• Links: www.denhaag.nl, www.thehagueonline.com, www.thehagueinternationalcentre.nl.\n\nThis video by the tourist office gives you a quick glimpse into The Hague.\n\nWhere to live in Het Gooi\n\nWith its lush green forests, rolling hills and affluent neighbourhoods, Het Gooi is one of the most coveted places to live in the Netherlands.\n\nThe region of Het Gooi – a cluster of villages southeast of Amsterdam and north of Utrecht on the hill ridge – is known as the home of the rich and famous. Some of the top-earning and most well-known Dutch celebrities and business people call its ritzy villages home.\n\nExpats in the Netherlands can live among the rich and famous in Het Gooi, too, as well as close to pristine nature reserves that are still easily accessible by private and public transportation – the only question is where. Expatica gives a short overview of the area, and how to select a new home in Het Gooi.\n\nA short history of Het Gooi\n\nThe name Het Gooi comes from the word gouw in Dutch, which refers to an old Germanic term for a region within a country – but the history of Het Gooi is much older than its name. Prehistoric pottery and burial mounds from the Bronze Age have been found in Hilversum, and the region remained largely undeveloped until the beginning of the 14th century.\n\nNaarden was the first city in Het Gooi, and has preserved much of its history as well as its remarkable form: the pointed star shape of medieval bastion forts. The region continued to grow thanks to the waterways built between the 16th and 18th century, leading from Amsterdam. As a result, rich merchants and other wealthy individuals flocked to Het Gooi to build their massive villas.\n\nHet Gooi is often combined with the Vechtstreek region and Eemland, which is just to the west of Het Gooi and includes the Vecht River as well as Eemnes, Baarn and Soest; the two regions make up the protected North Holland region of Gooi and Vechtstreek. While the actual composition of the region is debatable, Het Gooi typically comprises Blaricum, Hilversum, Huizen, Laren and Gooise Meren, the latter of which became a municipality in 2016 and includes Bussum, Muiden and Naarden. The Gooi and Vechtstreek region comprises the municipalities of Het Gooi, as well as Vechtstreek municipalities Weesp and Wijdemeren. The municipality Stichtse Vecht is also considered part of the Vechtstreek region, which includes Nigtevecht and Breukelen, among others.\n\nThe top three places to live in Het Gooi\n\nHilversum\n\nHilversum, as the centre of Het Gooi and the Hollywood of Holland, is one of the best places to live in the Netherlands for young expats. The city is thriving, with nearly 90,000 inhabitants and the famous Media Park – a business park that houses Dutch public broadcasting system NPO and media company RTL, among others – which provides ample job opportunities and an international atmosphere. A shopping district – the largest in Het Gooi – and plenty of festivals and events make it popular for the younger crowd, but kid-friendly neighbourhoods and a large number of international schools in Hilversum make it ideal for parents as well.\n\nNaarden\n\nThose who want to live near Amsterdam in a city with a rich history can opt to live in Naarden, part of the Gooise Meren municipality – which, according to Elsevier, is one of the top 10 best municipalities in the whole of the Netherlands. The town is located within the impressive star fort, and is a quiet, family-friendly place to live, with large houses and streets as well as ample parking space (unlike many Dutch cities that feature narrow roads and limited parking).\n\nBussum\n\nSouth of Naarden is Bussum, once just a small hamlet that grew into one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in the Netherlands. Het Spiegel, a residential area on the west side of the village, contains a number of majestic 19th- and 20th-century villas, many of which are available to rent. The Naarden-Bussum railway station is located in the northeast of Bussum, providing easy transportation to Hilversum and Almere (10 minutes) and Amsterdam, including Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (about 30 minutes).\n\nTop three places to live in Gooi and Vechtstreek\n\nEemnes\n\nAlthough not technically part of Het Gooi, Eemnes is often considered as a member of the club. With tons of green space and just about 9,000 residents, it’s a paradise for families with young children or those looking to get away from the bustle of the city but still remain within reach. Eemnes is also known as one of the most accessible places in the Netherlands, with one report claiming that one could travel to any place in the Netherlands within 78 minutes – ideal for those who are always on the move.\n\nBlaricum\n\nThe current Blaricum municipality exists alongside the old village and the neighbourhoods Crailo and the Bijvanck.\n\nBlaricum is a village with a friendly and open character. The village is adjacent to the water first and the other side is surrounded by moorland, beautiful forest and Engen. Blaricum is surrounded by greenery and agricultural history still makes her proud. The old farmhouses in the village recall times when agriculture was the main source of income. The beautiful villas around it indicate a rich history.\n\nThose who drive into the old village of Blaricum, immediately see the farms with thatched roofs. Some of these farms have been from known artists and visionaries. Blaricum has a lot of valuable architectural buildings built by famous architects. Characteristic of the old village are the winding roads, the workers and the beautiful green hedges. The fields with rye and buckwheat offer a beautiful sight.\n\nBlaricum has cosy restaurants such as the Red Sun, Tretorria Bruno, Moeke Spijkstra and the Oude Tak, as well as unusual shops. One of its ice cream shops was named the best ice cream maker of the Netherlands in 2009.\n\nLaren\n\nThe small village Laren is located in the heart of the Gooi area. It also is the oldest village in the area. Although this used to be a farmers villages nowadays it is one of the places to be.\n\nIn the heart of the village, the Brink, you will find interesting shops, cosy cafes and excellent restaurants. There is also St John’s Basilica and in the summer season a pancake stall. Under the old oak is regularly played bocce. On the Brink, you find a variety of activities like the May 4 Memorial, Queen’s festivities and ice skating in winter.\n\nIn the nice centre of Laren, you find more than 80 mode boutiques and can discover the delights of shopping. Or you settle down at one of the many terraces and look at the shoppers. Laren creates beautiful, varied walks along the picturesque Saxon farmhouses. In the surrounding nature, you find different tracks. Also, a bike ride is a fun way to get to know the area.\n\nLoosdrecht\n\nThe highlight of Loosdrecht, a town within the municipality of Wijdemeren, is its lakes – the Loosdrechtse Plassen become holiday hotspots in the warmer months. Here you can rent a boat, start sailing lessons or water-skiing. The area is actually divided in two: Oud-Loosdrecht is to the west, right on the lake where the residences are mostly lakeside villas. Nieuw-Loosdrecht is further east and is more urban than its leisurely counterpart.\n\nNigtevecht\n\nFor truly small-town living, Nigtevecht is a favourite. With a population of just over 1,000, Nigtevecht has far more green areas (and blue, thanks to its many lakes) than people; it’s one of the reasons it is a generally a holiday spot. Older couples looking to settle down or families with outdoorsy children may find their perfect home in Nigtevecht.\n\nWhere to live in Amstelveen\n\nAmstelveen is a leafy, prosperous, family-oriented suburb close to Amsterdam, which has a growing population of international residents.\n\n“I’m glad I’m living in Amstelveen; it’s greener than Amsterdam, but you still have the advantage of living next to a big city.” – G.B., Latvian, Amstelveen\n\nGreen and leafy, nestled between Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport and flanked by the huge park Amsterdamse Bos, Amstelveen is suburban and family-oriented with a middle- to up-scale feel.\n\nAs a suburb of Amersterdam, prices are slightly cheaper than in the centre and there’s more family-style housing with gardens (80 percent built after 1960). There are many green areas, excellent shopping and local amenities, particularly for sporty types. The extra space means parking is not a problem and many homes have garages. Amstelveen’s population is booming, expected to reach almost 86,000 citizens by 2020. Some 3,000 houses are estimated to be built by 2023, with more than half on the edge of the Westwijk area.\n\nWhat does Amstelveen offer?\n\nClose proximity to both Schipol airport and Amsterdam make Amstelveen attractive for international companies, and high living standards appeal to a growing expat community. The International School of Amsterdam is based here with more than 1,000 students from over 50 countries, but pupils attending Amsterdam’s other international schools (such as the British School) often live in Amstelveen. The area is flanked by Amsterdam’s largest park, the Amsterdamse Bos, and the CoBrA Museum adds of a dash of culture.\n\nWhere to live in Amstelveen\n\nHet Oude Dorp\n\n‘The Old Village’ is the historic hub of the original settlement (1278) with the Amsterdamse Bos to the west and the town centre to the east. There’s a mix of older detached houses, farms, terraced houses, and apartments.\n\nWestwijk\n\nWestwijk is a relatively new area of Amstelveen, which is more modern and spacious and lined with small canals. The one central shopping zone in the centre of the neighbourhood preserves the feeling of a residential area. Larger detached family homes and villas are available here, in green and tranquil settings that offer a lot of individual privacy. These are premium properties, so expect to pay premium prices.\n\nElsrijk\n\nDirectly north of the town centre, this is considered classic Amstelveen with its wide streets, huge trees and post-war housing next to small parks. There are terraces, semidetached houses and villas.\n\nPatrimonium\n\nRunning along the Amsterdamse Bos, there’s a mix of housing, shops and businesses in a variety of styles and periods. The Prinsessenbuurt in the north west of Patrimonium is known for large open spaces and detached houses, set among some of the oldest small parks in the area.\n\nAmstelveen facts and links\n\n• Population: 85,749 (www.amstelveen.incijfers.nl)\n\n• International residents: 14 percent\n\n• International schools:\n\n• Florencius International School: www.florenciusinternationalschool.nl\n\n• International School of Amsterdam: www.isa.nl\n\n• Links: www.amstelveen.nl, www.amstelveenweb.com\n\nA guide to the neighbourhoods of Amsterdam\n\nMoving to Amsterdam? Here’s a guided tour through the best parts of the Dutch capital, which remains one of Europe’s best cities to live in.\n\nWith some 100km of canals and more bicycles than residents, Amsterdam’s scenic and quirky centre offers a diverse living experience for its dynamic population. 180 different nationalities make up around 50 percent of the city’s residents. There are many distinct neighbourhoods densely packed together and competition for housing is fierce. An estimated average range of rental prices in 2018 is EUR 18-EUR 23 per sqm.\n\nAccording to Patrick Daas from Expats Amsterdam, a company that provides a range of expat-related services from visas to mortgages, Amsterdam is expected to have a population of 850,000 by 2025. This growth will be made possible by new residential developments: IJburg and Zeeburgereiland in Oost, and Bongerd and Overhoeks in Noord; these neighbourhoods offered some of the most modern, spacious deals in 2018.\n\nHere’s a quick guide to Amsterdam’s neighbourhoods, with some tips from Patrick on the best places to live.\n\nCentre and canals\n\nIn the centre, apartments veer towards snug rather than spacious and stairs are steep. Prices on the canal ring (grachtengordel) lined with 17th- and 18th-century houses are vertiginous, although many expats enjoy the ‘typically Dutch’ experience in grandeur surrounds.\n\nJordaan\n\n“This district just west of the grachtengordel and north of Amsterdam’s shopping district is an exceptionally desirable neighbourhood”, says Daas. Its beautiful canals and quirky, narrow streets are occupied by a bohemian mixture of yuppies and expats, with a core of young families and business-owning locals. Prices have exploded in recent years and in terms of price per square metre, it offers poor value and accommodation is often cramped. In the bordering district of Westerpark, housing development on former industrial sites have filled the need for affordable three to four bedroom houses, with the benefit of a huge park nearby.\n\nDe Pijp\n\nDirectly south of the centre lies the regenerated ‘De Pijp’, or so-called Latin Quarter, which is a vibrant, funky neighbourhood that has benefited from government regeneration and initiatives to increase private-home ownership opportunities, to the benefit of many expats. Rising prices reflect its newfound status as a desired neighbourhood among Dutch college students, creative professionals and artists.\n\nSouth (Oud-Zuid)\n\nOud-Zuid is a popular upmarket location for expats with easy access to international schools, the Vondelpark and spacious, privately-owned housing. This is a wealthy part of the city, and its demographics have supported its uptown spirit for decades. There’s a leafy, gracious-living feel with cafes and shopping streets to match. Duivelseiland is one desirable part with apartment accommodation, numerous cafes and market shops.\n\nEast (Oost)\n\n“My husband and I moved to Amsterdam with high expectations about living in a vibrant, international, liberal and tolerant place. So far I haven’t been disappointed.” – Aliye Kurt-Suedhoff, Turkish-Canadian, Amsterdam\n\nPast De Pijp on the other side of the Amstel river lie Oost and the Indische Buurt. “Things were cheaper here until a gentrification movement of young professionals and creative experts introduced trendy cafes and shops and spiked rental and housing prices” says Daas, but still, the bonus of the river, newly-renovated Oosterpark, and the area’s proximity to nature reserves and rivers make this zone very appealing to a wide variety of Amsterdam dwellers. From students to internationals, young families to retirees, expats to long-time residents, Oost side is a melting pot of culture.\n\nWest (Oud-West)\n\nWest of the Vondelpark is Oud West, similar to Oost in demographics, where housing is cheaper (and smaller) yet very popular with expats, particularly districts such as Helmersbuurt, which is a little more urban and edgy than Oud-Zuid and not as expensive for buyers. As an up-and-coming area of the city, it’s an exciting place to be, and prices are rising as bars and shops make way for renovations and new neighbours. With the recent creation of De Hallen, a shopping/cultural centre which is home to popular gourmet food court Food Hallen, the neighbourhood has also seen a slew of new residential developments crop up, attracting young families and internationals.\n\nNoord\n\nThere are many quaint, green areas of Noord with curving streets of small English-country-inspired houses; and these are highly coveted now that the district is going through a tremendous cultural revival. But Noord covers a lot of land (all the way to the charming country villages of Broek in Waterland and Uitdam), and the formerly industrial areas are being reclaimed by creative developers who are entirely reshaping the area’s skyline. New housing is sprouting up like flowers in Spring, not only along the IJ River but also in the more rural areas as well. “Noord is the new hot spot to settle down” says Daas, who explains that amenities, transportation, infrastructures, and especially entertainment and culture are following suit.\n\nZeeburg, KNSM and Docklands\n\nBehind Centraal Station lies a very different Amsterdam. Zeeburg (which comprises Oostelijk Havengebeid, the Indische Buurt and the new islands of Ijburg) offers architecturally interesting surroundings in one of Amsterdam’s hottest development areas. It’s a little less family friendly, but a growing area. Further west and growing in popularity are KNSM Island and the Eastern Docklands.\n\n“Cycling along the water to work is a daily joy. What a difference from the misery of London commuting!” – C.F., British, Amsterdam. This former working port established on four artificial island peninsulas is becoming home to locals and expats who enjoy their modern accommodation options with a twist of traditional Dutch streetscapes and buildings. According to Daas, “the area is a good bet, as it offers more space for your housing budget, while remaining easily accessible to central Amsterdam.”\n\nLiving on a boat\n\nOf course, you can always consider living on a Dutch barge.\n\nAmsterdam facts and links:\n\n• Population: 844,952 as of January 2017 (www.os.amsterdam.nl)\n\n• International residents: 50.6 percent\n\n• International schools:\n\n• Amsterdam International Community School: www.aics.espritscholen.nl\n\n• Annexe du Lycée Français Vincent van Gogh: www.lyceevangogh.nl\n\n• British School of Amsterdam: www.britams.nl\n\n• International School Amsterdam (in Amstelveen): www.isa.nl\n\n• The Japanese School of Amsterdam: www.jsa.nl\n\n• Links: Expats Amsterdam, www.amsterdam.nl, www.iamsterdam.com (English site)\n\nWhere to live in Delft\n\nWedged between The Hague and Rotterdam, Delft is a beautiful historical town that attracts those seeking a quieter lifestyle with good city connections.\n\nDelft is home to the famous Delft blue earthenware, the acclaimed Delft University of Technology, Johannes ‘Girl-with-a-pearl-earring’ Vermeer, and a beautiful old church full of dead royals.\n\nLocated in the province of South Holland in between the cities of The Hague and Rotterdam, Delft with a population of around 100,000 inhabitants is proving to be a popular option for people wanting a more tranquil lifestyle with easy access to the larger cities in the area. It is particularly popular with young families seeking a quieter, safer and more spacious home environment, and the area is surrounded by nature.\n\nRoyal connection\n\nDelft is more than 750 years old and has historically been linked to the Dutch royal family. In 1584 William of Orange was shot and killed in Het Prinsenhof.\n\nNow a museum, the bullet holes can still be seen although over the years they have more than tripled in size because of all the visitors who felt the need to stick their fingers in them. William, like most of the royal family, lies buried in the crypt of the Nieuwe Kerk which stands majestically in the heart of Delft’s historic city centre.\n\nDelftware\n\nKnown worldwide for its Delftware, Delft is a favourite with day trippers and tourists who come by the bus loads to admire and buy the ceramics.\n\nThese days most of the blue and white that is for sale isn’t actually Delftware but cheap reproductions made overseas. If you are seeking the real thing, head to one of the two remaining factories that produce authentic Delftware: the Porceleyne Fles and the Delftse Pauw.\n\nCulture, food and taking the train home\n\nDelft is in essence a miniature version of Amsterdam. There are the same pretty canals and stately canal houses. Museums like the new Science Centre, the Tobacco Museum, Prinsenhof Museum and the Army Museum provide interesting outings for rainy days.\n\nThere is an abundance of bars and cafes, a few cinemas, and even the odd coffee shop. This is after all a college town, yet if Delft’s nightlife seems a little quieter than you desire, The Hague, Rotterdam and even Amsterdam are only a relatively short train ride away.\n\nIn fact transportation links in Delft are excellent. There is a tram line that connects the city to The Hague and the seaside town of Scheveningen and there are regular trains to and from the cities that surround Delft (The Hague is just 5 minutes by train, Rotterdam 15 minutes, Amsterdam 50 minutes). Delft has numerous recommended restaurants including the Micheli-starred ‘Aan de Zweth‘ in Zweth. Less upmarket, yet very popular with both locals and tourists due to its delicious homemade apple tart is Kobus Kuch situated on the Beestenmarkt.\n\nWhere to live in Delft\n\nCentre\n\nDelft’s inner city resembles Amsterdam’s swanky canals when it comes to the architecture and to real estate prices. A house on the Oude Delft, the equivalent of the Keizersgracht, can run in the millions and even the smaller, former working-class houses in the narrow streets of Delft’s historic city centre can cost anything from €300,000 and up. The university and the accessibility to larger Dutch cities places a greater demand on housing in Delft. Despite the high prices, the areas of Hof van Delft and the Westerkwartier remain popular with property buyers.\n\nTanthof\n\nYoung families and middle-income earners often prefer to live in the southern suburb of Tanthof. This residential area built in the 1970’s is a family neighbourhood with schools and services geared toward young families. More than 80% of residents are of Dutch origin.\n\nHof van Delft\n\nSimilar to Tanthof, this area is inhabited predominantly by young dutch families in single-family homes built before 1940. Location has the benefit of being walking distance to the railway station and central shopping area.\n\nVrijenban\n\nTo the north of the centre is Vrijenban, a green district which borders the recreation area of Delftse Hout. This is an older district, with more than 40% of homes more than 70 years old. More diversity in the ages and cultural backgrounds of residents than in Tanthof. Tram service and easy access to motorway.\n\nBuitenhof\n\nMainly high-rise rental flats in this spacious suburb. Colourful and diverse area due to cultural mix of local population. More than a third of the inhabitants are under 25.\n\nVoorhof\n\nSimilar to Buitenhof and with the population density twice the Delft average due to the proliferation of flats and high-rise buildings.\n\nAdjacent Towns\n\nRecommended options further afield are the small towns of Pijnacker, Delfgauw and Nootdorp. Collectively these towns are in a beautiful green municipality with just over 50,000 inhabitants, with an average 17% of foreign residents. Nootdorp has a local tram service and is connected to The Hague by train and bus.

The region accounts for around half of the country’s R&D (research and development) investment and is officially known as ‘Brainport’.\n\nAimed to be among the top 10 regions by 2020 in terms of technology and economy, this southeast area is a hub for start-up companies and employment opportunities. The creation of the collaborative Brainport Talent Centre (www.talentbox.nl) helps place skilled workers in international companies. Eindhoven is well connected with the railway station close to the centre and the airport 3km away has good international access and serviced by low-cost airlines.\n\nExpats in Eindhoven\n\nToday, thanks to hi-tech and multinational employers, there’s a large community of expats in Eindhoven. Eindhoven also has a world-class Technical University and the Design Academy Eindhoven which attract many international students.\n\nThere’s vibrant nightlife along Stratumseind – the Netherland’s longest café and bar strip – but also strong links to the nearby countryside and extensive sporting facilities. Phillips has sinced moved several operations to Amsterdam. The renovation of the former Philips terrain, Strijp-S, is adding an extra dimension of cultural, residential and commercial facilities to the city.\n\nHousing in Eindhoven\n\nUntil the arrival of Dr Philips in 1891, Eindhoven was not much more than a collection of villages. Because of 19th-century urban planning decisions, there are no canals, and pre-1940 architecture was destroyed by wartime bombing. But over the years things have changed immensely and for the better.\n\nThe centre of Eindhoven is popular especially for people seeking apartment housing in Eindhoven. Many expat families choose to live in the villages that surround this industrial city, where housing tends to be larger and with more green space. Access to Eindhoven centre is easy through a good road system, and the area is well connected to other cities via train and plane, so looking at housing surrounding Eindhoven is a viable option.\n\nWhere to live in Eindhoven\n\nLiving in Eindhoven Centre\n\nPeople living in the centre have plenty of facilities, including a shopping mall and scores of international restaurants. Accommodation is mainly in new, pricey apartments, which are popular with single expats and couples without children. International schools (attended by children from Den Bosch and Tilburg) and the PSV football stadium are also located here.\n\nNorth Eindhoven (Woensel)\n\nThe area north of the centre is divided by wide, tree-lined boulevards, and is mainly residential in nature. Housing is mostly newbuild with apartments and terraced houses for all budgets. Woensel South is cheaper and there’s a great market for ethnic shopping.\n\nEast Eindhoven\n\nSituated around the Karpendonkse Lake and Eckart Forest, the area has a range of housing including some exclusive detached properties.\n\nSouth Eindhoven\n\nThe Philips High-Tech Campus is situated at Gestel along with the International Primary School, the Open-air Museum and the Tongelreep International Swimming Complex. Expats also gravitate towards Stratum, with its wide range of modestly priced to exclusive housing.\n\nEindhoven real estate in surrounding villages\n\nThe villages closely surrounding Eindhoven’s centre are popular with expat families. Some international schools in the Netherlands are still within cycling distance and the sense of community is greater.\n\nNuenen was home to Vincent van Gogh (1883–1885) and the older centre stretches around a leafy village green. There’s some detached housing; outer areas are newer and mid-priced.\n\nVeldhoven is virtually a southwest suburb (the other side of the A2 from Eindhoven).
