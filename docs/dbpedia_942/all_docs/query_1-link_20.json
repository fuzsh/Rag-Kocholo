        "text": "This paper investigates by means of a scenario analysis which conditions have to be fulfilled for a successful introduction of electric vehicles in the city of Amsterdam. First, a short introduction to Amsterdam and electric vehicles is given. Next, four scenarios are constructed by means of the so-called Spider-model. The four quadrants of the model represent policy concerns about (inter)national flanking policies, local economic developments, local spatial policies and public transport policies, respectively. Four scenarios are constructed: &#39;Prosperous Amsterdam&#39;, &#39;Sustainable Amsterdam&#39;, &#39;Pauperized Amsterdam&#39; and &#39;Lonely Amsterdam&#39;. It is concluded that flanking policies at both the (inter)national and local level as well as a positive economic development are a sine qua non for a successful introduction and adoption of the electric vehicle. When these conditions are fulfilled, the electric vehicle may decisively contribute to the achievement of a...\n\nThe growing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions at the international level have shifted American and European policies to invest in sustainable mobility. Although substantial steps have been made in recent years, electric mobility is still not an integral part of today's transport systems. The aim of the study is to provide a comparative overview of the Italian approach to electric mobility and to define future approaches that could be used. Our research used a web-based survey, applying standard statistical methods to data processing. From these results the authors defined the playing field of the current results, and the variables for the future development of electric urban mobility. This analysis has shown a gap in the knowledge of the results reached in recent years by consumers and displayed an interest in new types of ecological fuels. Regarding Italian policies, it is clear that major efforts in economic and infrastructural facilitations are needed. In addition, this analysis can be used in the future to check for any developments and to generate a larger dataset with other partners."
