Act One: Stockholm City Hall was built between 1911 and 1923 in the style of a Venetian Renaissance palace. It contains the famous Golden Hall, which was designed to resemble a Viking longhouse of the type that might have been used to hold the thing, the meetings of the free men of the community. Its north wall features an enormous mosaic depicting the Queen of Mälaren − as Stockholm was historically known − seated on the bank of the eponymous lake as she receives homage from East and West. Act Two: Drawing on archaeological evidence, a young British-based academic recently revealed that the Vikings did not simply pillage and depart after arriving in East Anglia in the late eighth century, a fact that runs counter to the traditional belief. Instead, they established settlements, traded and conducted explorations. Finally, like the barbarians at the limes, the frontier of the Roman Empire, they intermingled with the population of the territory that became known as the English Danelaw, or ‘land of the Danish law’, one century later. There is no better example of this process of intermixing than the monetary regime then in operation, which featured two different forms of currency simultaneously in circulation. On the one hand, there were the coins still produced by Anglo-Saxon kings, and on the other, there was the silver currency whose value depended on its ‘weight’ − ingots and foreign coins that were diced or cubed − used in the Scandinavian countries. However, this system had simply been imported from the Islamic world, where, after being struck, the dirham was subdivided into regulated weights. From the eighth to the eleventh centuries, the Vikings, embodying that symbolic fresco in Stockholm’s Golden Hall, extended as far as the boundaries of Russia before pushing further to the Black Sea and the Byzantine Empire, as well as leaving an enduring mark in England and north-western France. They colonized Ireland and Greenland, and penetrated into the Mediterranean as far as the coasts of al-Andalous in the Iberian Peninsula and Sicily. They may also have reached what was later to be known as America. But what remains of the long and complex history of their presence in our collective academic, national, popular and European memories? As yet, no truly European narrative has arisen to rectify that dark legend once and for all – a legend of brutal conquerors who plundered monasteries, of heathen pirates who shamelessly pounced on the riches of the Romanized and later Frankish\n\n2\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nprovinces of Latin Christianity and of clans so factionalized that they would have seen exterior conquest merely as an outlet for their disunited state. In short, their world is seen as irreligious, kingless, lawless and rootless. It is the inverted version of the image that the clerics of former times and the modern historians who came after them were already elevating as the ‘true’ fountainhead of the Christian, civilized Latin West. There is no clearer proof of this deficiency than the great revival of the popularity of Nordic myths and sagas that has been taking place over the last twenty years or so. Often set against the background of Richard Wagner’s The Ring of the Nibelung, the stories are presented in films, games and literature in a magical or fantastical context, as a means of escape or a substitute for a supposedly disenchanted, postmodern world. Finally, as we have just seen with the example of the Vikings, the untrue often casts light on the true, and the periphery often reveals the centre. This second volume is intended to reflect that accumulation of reference points and their changing images in the modern memory, that interlocking and to-ing and fro-ing involving fiction and reality, and those imaginaries, our own and others’, as they have been briefly revealed using the Nordic lands by way of illustration. This is the reason why the singular noun, ‘Europe’, has been given the plural form. The subjects presented here are examined from a long-term perspective and in all their multiple facets, confirming the aptness of this use of the plural. They include cities carrying multiple historical layers such as Byzantium/Constantinople/ Istanbul and Vilnius/Wilno/Wilna/Vilne. They also include ‘chameleon’ figures such as Napoleon in his many different versions – French, German, Polish, English and Russian – as well as the Julius Caesar of Rome and Egypt, the Alexander the Great of Greece and India and the Habsburgs as seen through Austrian, Belgian, Spanish and Amerindian eyes. Some cities stand at a crossroads, such as Venice and Saint Petersburg; together with the isthmuses of the Balkans, the Adriatic and the Baltic, they form the outlines of the European peninsula. In this way, the history of this continent is one of frontiers, both physical and phantasmal − from Berlin’s fallen Wall, a frontier in the intellectual sense, to Chernobyl, a ‘non-place’ and a frontier of catastrophe. Readers will therefore be able to gain a full picture of these subjects as they circulate among heroic and cursed figures, inhabited and imaginary landscapes, exploring blind and voracious passions, regressive or transgressive routes and archived and invented languages. Most importantly, the process of selecting the list of subjects presented here was governed by the refractive and diffractive powers attributed to them by Europeans during the course of history. The great figures chosen, for instance, are all exemplary cases associated with moments that established a European identity, for better or for worse and involving both tyranny and genius. This was a Europe at the forefront of conquest (Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte), language (William Shakespeare), science, war (Joan of Arc and Winston Churchill), and where specific intellectual approaches were used to gain greater understanding of the world (Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes Gutenberg and Erasmus). Yet, each case is located at the edges between approbation at national level,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nlegendary status at European level and global significance, whether acknowledged or unconscious. This multidimensional character is also evident in the perception of the ‘Europes’ whose space is outlined here. It is a cohesive interior space, with its rural areas, churches, cities and squares and its three orders of society; following centuries of sedimentation, these produce a perennial impression of familiarity all the more distinct for being viewed from the outside. It is, equally, a fragmented space with its different forms of Catholicism, the Reformation adding to the existing Schism between Latin and Greek Christianity that occurred in 1054, and its dividing line separating the Catholic lands with their vineyards from the Protestant lands with their hops. It is a space bounded by seas – the Mediterranean, of course, but also Northern seas, circulation zones that provide routes from Saint Petersburg to Amsterdam, Venice and Istanbul. It has its rivers and mountains too; sometimes these have served as walls and ramparts, and sometimes as calls to transgression and migration, the ultimate nomadic practice being that of the Wandering Jew, whose eternal return unfailingly raises the question of European identity. By now it will have become clear that the ‘Europes’ explored in this section have not been presented as an exhaustive list but through a process of categorization. This encompasses its fears (plagues, wolves and the devil); its myths, often forged through literary exchange in the form of reuse or translation (Faust, Carmen, Don Quixote, traditional tales, etc.); its emotions (involving love and death, the search for meaning and dreams) and its boundaries. Each conveys the meaning of the whole, marking a point at which the indigenous and the hybrid meet. Like a pilgrim on the road to Santiago de Compostella, every individual will trace their own route through the ‘realms of memory’ brought together here − personalities, places, collective imaginaries and shared or disputed terms. For if there can be such a thing as shared memory, it could not emerge at the behest of historians; instead, it would only arise from a sense of appropriation experienced by readers as they assimilate the fifty or so essays comprising this section of The European Way, immersing themselves, as it were, in the depths of a still-living history. The structure chosen for this second volume of the work therefore presents both all the advantages and all the shortcomings of a selection made collectively by a team of authors. Fortunately, they represent a variety of cultures and languages to be found between the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Urals. Some choices may arouse curiosity. Why Churchill but not Charlemagne? Why an emperor but no pope? Why Shakespeare but not Dante? Why Europe’s two seas but no oceans? Why Prague or Saint Petersburg but not Vienna? Other notable omissions could be added to this list of absences: great monuments, great literary works, momentous dates and so on. Yet, although additions of this encyclopaedic nature would obviously have expanded the volume, they would not have altered its line of development, its spirit or the dynamics of its reflections, which were guided by the aim of treating Europe as totality, its interior as well as its exterior. This approach enables the reader to apprehend the different layers of a threefold memory: contemporary, sedimented and considered.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nAlexander and Caesar Power through arms OLAF B. RADER\n\nAlexander the Great of Macedonia and Julius Caesar of Rome quickly gained mythical status − one as a warrior hero and the embodiment of a conqueror, the other as the archetypal martial sovereign. They continue to shape the European memory, an impact that extends to epic ‘sword-and-sandal’ movies and comic books. In a scene in the 1963 cinema epic Cleopatra, Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) and the Queen of Egypt (Elizabeth Taylor) stand beside the alabaster sarcophagus of Alexander the Great. There, next to the general’s remains, they discuss the development of a new world order. Would the presence of his body have had a positive effect on their plans? This we do not know, yet the spectator’s attention is captured by something else; at a physical level, those two warriors would never again be in such close proximity to one another. In his Parallel Lives, Plutarch (ca. 45–ca. 125 CE) associated Alexander the Great of Macedonia (ca. 356–323 BCE) with Julius Caesar of Rome (100–44 BCE); had he guessed that over the next two millennia those two names would be used in Europe as reference points for certain ways of exercising power? One was to become the very incarnation of a conqueror, while the other was to create a regime that would bear his name. And as each embodied the archetypal charismatic warrior hero keen to enhance his power by endowing himself with a sacred aura, both were to influence a great many other domains in European history.\n\nTWO FIGUREHEADS Much has been written about their military campaigns and their policies. Yet, as is the case with so many major figures, their histories have taken the form of a series of legends that are constantly being rewritten. Indeed, both serve as exemplary illustrations of the ways in which these processes of transformation and recreation manifest themselves. Bertolt Brecht once pointedly asked whether the two generals had accomplished their feats without comrades in arms: ‘The young Alexander conquered India. Single-handedly? Caesar crushed the Gauls. But surely he brought\n\n8\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\na cook, at least?’ Yet, while they were obviously not alone, their actions were those of exceptional individuals rather than implementers of a collective will. And immediately after their deaths they began to serve as frameworks of reference and forces of legitimation. Alexander’s body was the focus of an actual war between the Diadochi, his generals and companions in arms, with each seeking to appropriate the king’s remains and thereby gain legitimacy as his successor. Later, the Roman emperors, beginning with Caesar and followed by Augustus, adopted the practice of visiting the tomb of Alexander, conqueror of the East. This tradition continued until the third century CE, after which knowledge of its location was lost. From then on, following their deaths, Alexander and Caesar became more than tokens of legitimacy for their heirs – they also provided them with a genuine directive, as those in possession of the remains of a dead sovereign inherited the power that had been vested in him. In this way, the name of Caesar was given to Roman emperors as a title, before becoming an indication of sovereignty independent of the individual exercising it. It is the origin of the German word Kaiser − meaning ‘emperor’ − and of the Ostrogoth term kaisar before it. The title tsar, which emerged in the old Slavic languages to designate Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian forms of monarchy, shares the same root. The most widely read work in the Middle Ages, after the Bible, was the Roman d’Alexandre (The Romance of Alexander), for the simple reason that the text, of which there were multiple versions, provided answers to certain questions: how should a good knight and an explorer avid for new discoveries conduct himself? How should a generous and wise king act? During the Renaissance, spectacular recreations of the triumphal progress of these two warrior heroes became highly popular, as the generals of the day were keen to vanquish their foes and witness the latter’s subjugation in the same manner. One example of this is provided by the Italian painter Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506). His series entitled The Triumphs of Caesar, created for the palace of the Dukes of Gonzaga at Mantua, comprises nine large paintings depicting a military parade complete with multiple spoils of war and captives. This reference to the victorious generals no doubt allowed the Gonzaga family to believe that it too could triumph over its enemies just as Caesar had done. In the history of ideas, Alexander and Caesar have constantly served as touchstones in discourses on the highest office of the state, or as models for human action, for example in the works of William Shakespeare and George Frideric Handel. In his Lectures on the Philosophy of History, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel included Caesar among ‘these World-Historical persons, whose vocation it was to be the agents of the World-Spirit’.1 For Theodor Mommsen, Caesar was above all ‘an accomplished statesman’, and Mommsen saw this as something that differentiated him from Alexander, Hannibal and Napoleon. To mark the transfer of Napoleon’s remains from Saint Helena to Paris in 1840, Victor Hugo composed a poem, ‘The Return of the Emperor’, in which he appears as the equal of the Homeric gods, Alexander and Caesar. One of the two invincible heroes who had been in such close proximity to one another at Alexandria has now met his match. The fact that a small village in Gaul\n\nALEXANDER AND CAESAR\n\n9\n\ndared to defy that military genius, Caesar − at least in the humorous comic books by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo – was certainly down to a magic potion brewed by a druid and much appreciated by Asterix and Obelix. Yet the stories are also a nod from the present day to the Roman general and the admiration he inspired.\n\nNOTE 1.

Napoleon shaped the face of Europe and made a lasting impact on collective memories. Whether they celebrate his victories or his defeats, each European country has now appropriated him in its own way. A French emperor who imposed his rule on Europe by war and was responsible for the deaths of millions of its citizens – civilians as well as soldiers – may seem an unlikely hero for the twenty-first century. Yet Napoleon’s name continues to be cited and often revered; after two centuries he remains the stuff of legends, his reputation as one of the greatest generals of all time still intact. During the recent bicentenary of the empire, Napoleon’s battles have been lovingly recreated, as re-enactors from across Europe have turned out in their thousands on fields from Marengo to Austerlitz and from Borodino to Waterloo. Military enthusiasts from countries that once battled against him now vie for the honour of serving in his imperial guard. Napoleon and his campaigns still elicit feelings of profound nostalgia.\n\nBICENTENARY COMMEMORATION States across Europe have pumped public funding into acts of commemoration on an epic scale. Often, of course, they have been celebrating their own history as much as Napoleon’s memory. Britain – arguably the country that profited most from Napoleon’s downfall – was prominent among them, seemingly eager to revive the memory of victories won under Nelson and Wellington. Most remarkably, on the bicentenary of Trafalgar in 2005, Britain staged a huge naval review, attended by the queen and boasting the participation of thirty-six foreign navies and more than a hundred warships. The French gamely took part, even though their fleet had been destroyed at Trafalgar, sending, somewhat bizarrely, the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle to join the line of ships assembled on the Solent. So in 2012, Russia celebrated the bicentenary of the Battle of Borodino – known in France as La Moskowa – with great pomp and state ceremonial. Vladimir Putin, who\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n11\n\nhad evoked the battle as a symbol of Russian unity during his re-election campaign earlier in the year, was present on the battlefield, cheering a re-enactment by more than three thousand actors and laying a wreath in remembrance of those who fell. It was an impressive occasion which attracted huge crowds as the Smolensk Icon of the Virgin Mary returned to the battlefield for only the second time, to be blessed by the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. The icon was heavy with symbolism for all those present, a link between past and present. On the eve of the battle in 1812 Russian generals and soldiers had prayed to the Virgin for strength and victory. For the centenary in 1912, when Tsar Nicholas II had led the celebrations, the icon had been solemnly paraded around the battlefield. Significantly, the bicentenary celebrations placed great emphasis on the icon and on God’s intervention to save Russia. At the close of the ceremony it was taken from the battlefield to Moscow’s Christ the Saviour Cathedral, which had been built as an act of thanksgiving for the battle, and here a prayer vigil was attended by some seventeen thousand people. The importance which Russia still attaches to Borodino is a powerful illustration of Napoleon’s impact across Europe. His memory has not been allowed to die. And if the re-enactment for the bicentenary was staged on a heroic scale, there are regular re-enactments every year, on the first Sunday of September, as a reminder of the struggle of the Russian people against an invader commanding a mass army recruited across Europe. Successive Russian regimes have gloried in that memory. The Soviet Union built a huge panorama of the battle on Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow to mark the 150th anniversary in 1962 and issued a special commemorative coin twenty-five years later. And of course the battle has an honoured place in Russian literature, in Lermontov’s poem Borodino or in Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Napoleon, it is clear, has left a profound mark on the collective memory of Europe, giving birth to myths and legends across the continent and beyond. In France a cult developed around him, especially after his death in 1821 and the publication two years later of Las Cases’s Mémorial de Sainte-Hélène. Peasants collected the brightly coloured images (images d’Epinal) of his soldiers that were sold at local markets or listened to Béranger’s verses, urging them to keep the faith, to believe that he was not dead and that, as with Christ, there would be a Second Coming. His legend emphasized honour and glory, sacrifice and masculinity, qualities consonant with a great military hero. That is the aspect of Napoleon that lives on most strongly in popular culture: in films, on radio and television, in cartoon books and in the seemingly inexhaustible range of electronic war games which replay his battles and deconstruct his tactical genius. For the young, especially, Napoleon remains, first and foremost, a god of war.\n\nTHE LEGACY OF THE EMPIRE The Napoleonic Empire brought more than guns and bloodshed to the lands he conquered; in much of Europe it was associated with new institutions, with the end of feudalism and the introduction of modern systems of governance and justice. The Napoleon of popular legend overturned thrones and created kings almost at\n\n12\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nwill. A stroke of his pen consigned the Holy Roman Empire, and with it a thousand years of history, to oblivion. For many he was a liberator whose name, for much of the nineteenth century, conjured up images of modernity and national pride. That memory, too, lives on. In the Museum of the Risorgimento in Milan the first three rooms are devoted to Arcola, Marengo and the French invasion of Italy. In Croatia, where Napoleon’s memory is sustained in folk art and song, a monument was erected to him in Ljubljana in 1929 at a ceremony to mark the 120th anniversary of the creation of the Illyrian provinces. In Poland, to this day, the national anthem recalls Dąbrowski’s march and sings to the glory of Napoleon’s Polish troops, fighting in the name of his Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Sweden even chose a Napoleonic marshal, Bernadotte, to rule as its new king. Everywhere, it seemed, a new world was dawning; or, as the great German historian Leopold von Ranke memorably phrased it, ‘in the beginning was Napoleon’. Not everywhere, of course, has his memory been honoured. In some European states, like Russia, Prussia and Spain, Napoleon’s foremost contribution was an inadvertent one, in that he contributed to the construction of a new national identity in opposition to his regime. For north Germans, in particular, the turning point was the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig, which would often be represented – with more than a grain of imagination – as the moment when Germans had come together as a nation to expel a foreign invader from their lands. Indeed, one of the earliest organizations set up after 1815 to promote cultural nationalism among Germans, the Burschenschaft movement, wallowed tirelessly in the memory and the myth of Leipzig. Other victories against Napoleon may have entered the military and naval legends of the countries that fought in them: for the Russians Borodino, for the British Waterloo and – at sea – Trafalgar. His invasion of Spain was the catalyst for an anti-French reaction that spread to Cuba and Spanish Central America. But none was turned into a foundation myth of a nation quite like Leipzig. The battle would inspire succeeding generations of Germans and underpin the new German Reich after 1871; it would become a place of pilgrimage for Prussian generals; and it would be commemorated on its centenary in 1913 with an unashamedly militaristic memorial – the Völkerschlachtdenkmal – in the outskirts of the Saxon capital. For the cultural nationalists of nineteenth-century Germany, it was important to keep the battle’s memory alive: here, as in many other parts of Europe, Napoleon and the Napoleonic Wars were indeed a lieu de mémoire. In Spain’s South American colonies Napoleon’s legacy proved equally profound, both through soldiers and political leaders like Miranda and Simon Bolivar, and through institutions like the Code. In the early nineteenth century, the Code Napoléon was introduced into Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it is still in force. Bolivia and Chile borrowed heavily from it, and the Chilean code would be copied in turn by Ecuador and Colombia, closely followed by Uruguay and Argentina. In the United States, too, Napoleon’s influence can still be felt: towns in seven different states are called ‘Napoleon’, and two others ‘Bonaparte’. In 1815, after Waterloo, Napoleon’s first thought had been to seek refuge across the Atlantic, and many of his officers and soldiers, deprived of their livelihood in France, had sought new adventures in the Americas.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n13\n\nNAPOLEON AND EUROPEAN UNITY But today, two hundred years after his defeat at Waterloo and his second abdication, how secure is Napoleon’s place in history? He may have claimed the idea of Europe as his own, aiming to unite the continent through his imperial project in a way that seemed to presage the Europe of the post-1945 world. But in the age of the European Union, that notion of unification, by conquest and imposition rather than by agreement among equals, can seem outmoded, especially in a Germany which since 1945 has been resolute in its opposition to the use of armed force in war. Besides, after Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 few European leaders were prepared to listen to that narrative, and at Leipzig in 1813 ruler after ruler, persuaded that Napoleon’s star had deserted him, abandoned the empire to join a new coalition aligned against him. Most of the other heads of state were agreed that European unity could not be achieved by applying Napoleon’s military model; indeed, most came to regard him, as the British press had consistently done, as a usurper who was incapable of living at peace with his neighbours. For them no compromise was possible, and St Helena, a distant rock in the storm-battered South Atlantic, was the only conceivable destination for a man whose ambition made his continued presence in Europe a threat to public order. The caricatures that were published at the moment of his downfall, portraying him as a criminal, a devil, a miscreant to be punished or a wild beast to be caged, express more eloquently than any words the anger and relief that were felt across the continent in 1815 when Napoleon, as Britain’s prisoner on the Northumberland, sailed south from Plymouth. And the caricatures published in London, by Thomas Cruickshank, James Gillray or William Elmes, had their counterparts in most of continental Europe, in Holland, Germany, Russia and, of course, in Bourbon France itself. Napoleon did not, as his enemies hoped, disappear into oblivion on St Helena; he lived on in public memory to become one of the defining figures of the nineteenth century, worshipped by some, reviled by others. For his detractors he was a warmonger who had condemned millions of their people to death and misery – an image that was most famously captured in Francesco Goya’s heartrending drawings of The Disasters of War, a set of eighty-two pictures that chronicled the sufferings of the Spanish people and helped to forge a patriotic myth of the Spanish guerrilla fighter martyred in the nation’s cause. Napoleon was held personally to blame, for the spread of war, the invasion of their territory and the conscription of their sons for the army. He had desecrated their churches, burned their towns, raped their women and ordered the slaughter of their priests. In Spain, Portugal and some other parts of Mediterranean Europe, while a Napoleonic legend would persist, it was a dark legend, unleavened by experience of justice or good governance. So in those European cities that had suffered at his hands, like Hamburg and Leipzig, Burgos and Moscow, it would prove impossible to separate the memory of the empire from the devastation of siege and war. Here Napoleon’s memory was not that of a great lawgiver; rather, it was of a tyrant who had condemned them to plague and massacre and who had finally united their country against him. It was not far removed from the image of the ogre with which British mothers in the years after Waterloo sought to frighten their children into obedience.\n\n14\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nBut still, Napoleon’s memory lived on. Even those writers who had feared or distrusted him could not ignore him. Walter Scott wrote a biography of him; Chateaubriand confessed a fascination for him; while romantic writers like Hugo and Stendhal, Goethe and Heine acknowledged him to be the greatest man of his age. To his supporters, Napoleon was a hero to be compared to the greatest rulers in history, an emperor – as he had portrayed himself – in the glorious traditions of Antiquity, a fitting successor to Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire of the High Middle Ages. In 1840, with the Return of the Ashes and his burial in Les Invalides, his heritage was assured. Henceforth, in the words of the Minister of the Interior Charles de Rémusat, ‘France, and France alone, will possess all the remains of Napoleon. His tomb, as his fame, will belong to no-one but to the nation as a whole.’\n\nTHE NAPOLEONIC NARRATIVE TODAY While Napoleon undoubtedly remains a part of Europe’s collective memory, that memory has tended to fade with time. The centenary celebrations for the First World War – a war which killed millions of men in Europe’s armies, as Napoleon’s wars had done, but whose victims seem closer to us today – are a reminder of how deeply the shadows it cast still impact on people’s lives a hundred years later. Those alive today lost grandparents in the First World War, fathers in the Second; they were people known to them, loved by them, whose lives had been recorded in photographs or in the letters and poems they left behind, whose sacrifice was celebrated in the images of war that they saw in newsreels and on film. The survivors of the Napoleonic Wars are necessarily more shadowy figures fading in the mists of time. In the nineteenth century it was very different: in all the combatant nations men returned from the army, pensioned off or placed on half-pay, to face the rigours of civilian existence at a time of mechanization and high unemployment. Those who had survived the war often lived long lives, and many of them looked back nostalgically on their years in uniform. When Napoleon III issued the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène in 1857 to all who had served in the armies of his great-uncle, he discovered – forty-two years after Waterloo – that there were still over four hundred thousand survivors. The last of Napoleon’s French soldiers did not die until 1894, and the last known soldier of the Grande Armée – who was a Pole – only in 1901. It would be the twentieth century before all communicative memory ceased, and Napoleon’s grognards were forced to cede ground to the Tommies and poilus of the Great War, to Rommel’s Afrika Korps and the Red Army’s defence of Stalingrad. Each generation has its heroes, and each has its losses to mourn. Just as important, however, is the political climate in Europe today. As France and Germany stand side by side at the core of the new Europe, what interest have they in stirring memories of Austerlitz or Jena (a battle so conclusive that it allowed Napoleon to deprive Prussia of one-third of its territory in the peace that followed)? Why should Britain, which has been allied to France in every war since 1815, wish to celebrate France’s (as well as Napoleon’s) defeat? The restrained tones of bicentennial events in much of western Europe, the desire to commemorate rather\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n15\n\nthan celebrate, the educational focus of so many of the historical exhibitions and, most of all, the failure of the French themselves to stage any public celebration for the greatest Napoleonic victories (Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram) suggest a reluctance to cause international embarrassment in an age when the relations between European powers are defined by cooperation and internationalism. The French government has been particularly discreet in its approach to public display, to the point where, in December 2005, at the very moment when several thousand enthusiasts celebrated the bicentenary of Austerlitz in the Czech Republic, neither the president of the Republic, Jacques Chirac, nor his prime minister chose to make an appearance. To many it seemed a humiliating gesture of political correctness, not least as the prime minister at the time, Dominique de Villepin, was himself a published author on the Napoleonic era. This prudent approach may also imply a degree of ambivalence, an uncertainty about how best to represent Napoleon at a time when it is less acceptable to public opinion to gloat over victory or to glorify war. France also, as a republic, is uncertain how enthusiastic it can be seen to be in praise of empire. In recent years this ambivalence has been made more acute by the issue of ethnic integration, since in African and Caribbean communities in France today Napoleon is remembered primarily as the man who restored slavery to the colonies and sought to re-establish the Atlantic slave trade. One of a number of anti-Napoleonic polemicists, Claude Ribbe, went further, accusing Napoleon of exterminating whole populations in the French West Indies on racial grounds. Though Ribbe may have exaggerated the degree of what he calls Napoleon’s ‘crimes’, he did raise an important question: can he be a fitting hero for the multicultural world of the twenty-first century, a world in which Toussaint Louverture and the ‘Black Jacobins’ of Haiti arguably enjoy greater popularity and esteem?\n\nFRANCE’S DIVIDED POLITICAL CULTURE This ambivalence also reflects unresolved divisions within French political culture, where, since the early nineteenth century, the commemoration of Napoleon has been heavy with political overtones and reflective of the political regime of the day. The Restoration monarchy attempted to ban all reference to the deposed emperor, setting agents and police spies to report on those bent on idolizing his memory. In contrast, the July Monarchy sought to gain political kudos by associating itself with Napoleon’s memory, Louis-Philippe surrounding himself with four Napoleonic marshals at his coronation ceremony before inaugurating the Vendome Column in 1834 and the Arc de Triomphe in 1836. And in 1848, following another revolution in Paris, it was to the Napoleonic tradition that the French people turned when they voted for Louis-Napoleon as their president, before, in Karl Marx’s memorable phrase, history repeated itself as farce when, in 1851, the president staged a military coup and had himself crowned emperor. The Second Empire was, predictably, the high point of the cult of Napoleon, the years when it was most acceptable to boast of one’s service in Napoleon’s armies and when memoirs written by officers of the Grande Armée achieved a new vogue.\n\n16\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nBut after 1870, with the return of the republic, France was again keen to divorce itself from the imperial legend. In the modern era, France has been firmly embedded in a republican tradition that is committed to upholding the ideals of 1789 – the tradition of 1789, of the revolution, not of the empire. For the first time since Napoleon’s death in 1821 the Napoleonic legend was divorced from party politics. One could be nostalgic without being Bonapartist: nostalgic for glory, for the army, for a world that was lost. Edouard Detaille’s paintings of the 1880s and 1890s are good examples of the spirit of the fin de siècle in France. It allowed the Napoleonic legend to be revived in the broader context of popular culture. Napoleon could now be presented as a historical figure that was above politics, a patriotic hero whom both republicans and royalists might seek to emulate – as a ruler, as a soldier and, above all, as a human being.\n\nNAPOLEON AND THE PUBLIC In plays like Rostand’s L’Aiglon and Sardou’s Madame Sans-Gêne Napoleon is reduced to a supporting role, presenting a more intimate and less public figure, fashioned by individuals’ needs and consumed as popular entertainment. This trend was not confined to France – as witness the popular novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of the Six Napoleons, where the clue that allowed Sherlock Holmes to solve a murder mystery lay in mass-produced busts of the emperor, still popular in England at the time of the novel’s publication in 1904. The Staffordshire porcelain industry had done good business out of Napoleonic memorabilia in the later nineteenth century, as did ceramic firms from Limoges to Dresden. In the twentieth century he would be an iconic figure in world cinema, with hundreds of films produced – from Russia to Hollywood, Egypt to Brazil – recounting episodes from his life or revelling in the exploits of his army. Abel Gance’s Napoléon of 1927 is probably the most famous; but there have been many since, among them several screen versions of Waterloo and of War and Peace. In Germany, the Napoleonic Wars have been presented as one of the ‘great epochs’ of modern history, and, both during the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich, were one of the favourite themes of German cinema, offering powerfully gendered images of resolution and masculinity. Whether he was presented as a hero or a villain, it seems that Napoleon continued to inspire cinema audiences across the globe. The world wars of the twentieth century brought Napoleon’s conquests into new focus as countries again found themselves the victims of attack and invasion. In Russia, in particular, comparisons with Hitler’s invasion were almost unavoidable, and Stalin called on his fellow citizens to resist the invasion in 1941 just as their ancestors had done in 1812. He was not alone. In Britain the government made direct comparisons between Operation Sea Lion and Napoleon’s camp at Boulogne. And even in France itself the Free French could not resist cross-referencing Hitler’s decision to invade Russia with Napoleon’s dreams of European conquest. Both, it was implied, plunged the world into war in pursuit of conquest; and both were condemned to fail. Some have, of course, gone further, suggesting, somewhat\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n17\n\nimplausibly, that Napoleon’s expansionist ambitions directly presaged Hitler’s and that the two men shared a common purpose in launching their wars of aggrandizement. Though direct comparisons between Napoleon and Hitler are unsustainable, what is clear is that Hitler took a personal interest in the history of Napoleonic Europe and profited from his visit to Paris in 1940 to visit the emperor’s tomb. Overall, the experience of the Second World War helped revive memories of the Napoleonic Wars and did much to undermine Napoleon’s reputation in ways that have been reflected in the recent commemorations. While politicians have hesitated to give their imprimatur to the celebration of Napoleon, and the academy in France has tended to eschew political biography, Napoleon has continued to enjoy popularity with the general public. People still crowd to the Invalides to stand respectfully before Napoleon’s tomb; and of the many thousands of visitors to the Butte du Lion at Waterloo, the majority come not to see the spot where Wellington triumphed but to look out over Victor Hugo’s morne plaine, the field where Napoleon’s heroic dream was finally doomed to fail. Polls have consistently placed Napoleon among the ‘greatest Frenchmen’ in the eyes of the French people, though today he is unable to compete with the most admired figure of the twentieth century, Charles de Gaulle. And television, which tends to privilege biography and the story of ‘great men’ in its presentation of history, has shown a continuing interest in his career and, of course, in his love life, from Josephine to Maria Walewska. To commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of his birth in 1969 French television channels broadcast around forty-six hours of programmes over a nine-month period, and Napoleonic themes have remained popular subjects for history and literary programmes. But such programming is no longer unreservedly uncritical. In recent years there have been repeated attempts to undermine the cult of the emperor on television and to challenge his place in the pantheon of great Frenchmen, to question what Jean Tulard has called ‘the myth of the Saviour’. For the French Republic it has not always been a comfortable myth to live with.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Bluche, Frédéric, Le bonapartisme: aux origines de la droite autoritaire, Paris, Nouvelles Éditions Latines, 1980.

If we define a tyrant (the word could simply mean ‘sovereign’ in ancient Greek) as someone who violates human or divine laws in the exercise of power, then the phenomenon is certainly not exclusive to Europe and nor did it originate here. The history of other continents abounds in despotic princes, each more cruel than the last. On the other hand, the concept is probably a European invention. This story has early origins, beginning in the year 514 BCE with the tyrannicides of ancient Athens. These refer to the actions of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who plotted to assassinate Hippias and Hipparchus, members of the Peisistratid family, achieving this aim in the case of Hipparchus. The Peisistratids had abused their power for their own profit, robbing the Athenian people of their autonomy. Democratic Athens paid due honour to the ‘slayers of tyrants’ by erecting statues to them; these adorned the city for a considerable time. The Peisistratids were subsequently condemned to a form of damnation in the collective memory based on their extraneity; owing to their tyrannical characters and actions, they were regarded for ever afterwards as alien to the city. The same was true of despotic ancient Roman principes such as Caligula and Nero, who were denounced as foreign − ‘Orientals’ in this instance − and therefore strangers to Roman tradition and culture. In the case of Caligula, who had been brought up in Egypt, this was partially accurate.\n\nFROM THE KING OF THE PERSIANS TO THE GREAT TURK A tyrant was therefore someone who ruled over other peoples, a notion that likewise dates back to the ancient Greeks. It is enough to read Herodotus, Thucydides and the Greek tragedians to understand that the Greeks were very well able to govern themselves, while the Orientals (essentially the Persians) were incapable of doing so.\n\n20\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nAn amorphous, indolent mass, the latter could only be brought to bestir themselves when under the merciless dominion of an evil king who was himself under the sway of his own evil passions. Freedom, like reason, was the prerogative of the Greeks. This mindset persisted throughout European history until the twentieth century. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers engaged in political thought, the foremost among them being Montesquieu, presented the ‘tyrant’ or the ‘despot’ as an Oriental figure in the purest classical tradition. The archetypal tyrant was now the ‘Great Turk’, seen as the distant heir of the king of the Persians or as his re-embodiment. He was dreaded in the continent’s frontier territories (a dread that extended as far as Vienna!) and mocked as the ‘Grand Mamamouchi’ in Molière’s comedies. The figure of the ‘Great Turk’ proved a highly convenient means of indirectly criticizing certain abuses of power in Europe and escaping censorship. A particular focus of attack was the concept of the ‘absolute monarch’ totally unbound by law that had been developing since the sixteenth century. Countering this new notion of princehood, European aristocrats such as Bodin, Bainville and Montesquieu extolled the mythical memory of ‘Germanic’ − in other words, European − freedom as a contrast to the malevolent figure of the Oriental tyrant. From this standpoint, Montesquieu’s Lettres persanes is a masterly demonstration of condemnation and irony, in which one of the subjects of the Great Turk indulges in a criticism of the power exerted by Louis XIV. Was the Sun King, therefore, a worse tyrant than the sultan? Not so, replied those who championed the system known as Absolute Monarchy − a Christian king is subject to the laws of God. Europe appeared preoccupied by two major forces of tyranny in the nineteenth century. This first of these was Napoleon, the insignificant Corsican from the minor nobility who rose to imperial dominance. Significantly, it was the ruling aristocratic powers, reacting with fear and disgust, which had him exiled to the margins of the continent. The ‘Corsican ogre’ was a wild islander, a stranger to Europe and its laws; he had wrought havoc in the cosmos, whose order had been created by an age-old power. The aptly named ‘Restoration’ brought his tyranny to an end, re-establishing the ‘Holy Alliance’, sealing the accord made in 1815 between the tsar, the king of Prussia and the emperor of Austria, and quashing the evil unleashed by a godless Revolution and the Devil from Corsica. The second force of tyranny was that of the Russian autocrats, who reigned over a nation of serfs. In this case too, the tyrant was driven to the edges of the continent, towards the remote wilderness of the steppes. It was by exploiting the most commonplace stereotypes of Russian tyranny that the most murderous dictator in history, Adolf Hitler, was able to justify his power and his actions, and this in the middle of the twentieth century. The Nazis ceaselessly condemned the ‘Asiatic’ power of the ‘Judeo-Bolsheviks’ led by Joseph Stalin, whom they likened to such figures as Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan, also regarded as enemies of man and God in their day. The most atrocious figures of tyranny were seen as invariably emerging, at regular intervals, from the margins of Europe, where civilization ended. And in order to defend European civilization, the ‘Asiatic’ barbarian had to be defeated. After 1945, this repeated refrain used in Nazi\n\nTHE TYRANT, OR THE PERVERSION OF POWER\n\n21\n\npropaganda resurfaced as ‘background music’ to the message delivered by the ‘free world’ to the Soviet ‘bear’. Once again, threats to liberty were external; they came from the margins, or the area that lay beyond the Iron Curtain. Europe’s representation of itself is therefore solidly anchored in the age-old belief that it is indisputably the continent of freedom − despite colonization, the Great War, fascism and Nazism. As has been the case since the ancient Greeks, tyranny remains a foreign phenomenon.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Azoulay, Vincent, Les Tyrannicides d’Athènes, Paris, Le Seuil, 2014.

Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill (1874–1965) began his career as a soldier, journalist and author and served in the British Parliament for over six decades. He held a wide variety of offices, including two spells as prime minister (1940–5, 1951– 5). Whereas it is in many ways natural that he should be chiefly remembered for the Second World War, the era of his greatest achievements, it is nonetheless the case that memories of him are shaped by a very specific iconography which is reinforced by a series of lieux de mémoire, which themselves are frequently shown in TV documentaries and filmed dramatizations of Churchill’s life. It must be emphasized that Churchill remains a contested figure, and even positive memories of him are not homogenous. Within mainland Europe, Churchill is often hailed, with debatable plausibility, as one of the forefathers of the EU, whereas in Britain he is most usually taken as a symbol of patriotic identity, frequently to the point of chauvinism. Churchill did a great deal to cultivate his own historical reputation, not least through the publication of his voluminous First and Second World War memoirs, which themselves also contributed to him winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953. But if he could shape his reputation he could never have hoped to fully control it. Even before 1914, he was both a globally known figure and, in terms of domestic politics, a highly controversial one. Moreover, the failed Dardanelles campaign of 1915 is something that will always be associated with his name. Such episodes of poor Churchillian judgement resonate differently according to location. For example, the Bengal famine of 1943, in respect of which Churchill displayed considerable callousness and racism, is unsurprisingly much more of a sore point in India than in the UK. In the final stages of Churchill’s life, would-be custodians of his memory – ‘reputational entrepreneurs’ to use Gary Alan Fine’s terms – began the process of cementing his legacy. The first generation of these ‘entrepreneurs’ had strong\n\nCHURCHILL\n\n23\n\nconnections to Churchill personally in some way, and genuinely wished to protect his memory against assault by detractors. For example, John Colville, Churchill’s former private secretary, poured effort into the creation of Churchill College, Cambridge, which reflected Colville’s concern both to memorialize Churchill and to promote scientific education in Britain. The college, which has a strong focus on mathematics, science and technology, received its royal charter in 1960. Colville additionally threw his energy into the creation of the Churchill Archives Centre, based at the college and opened in 1973, which preserves Churchill’s own papers and those of many of his associates. Perhaps the most recognizable piece of Churchill iconography of all is the statue in Parliament Square, by Ivor Roberts-Jones. Within Parliament itself another statue stands by the Churchill Arch that leads into the Commons chamber. Damaged by wartime bombing, the arch was rebuilt from the rubble in order to symbolize ‘the continuity of our institutions’, as The Times wrote on October 1950. There are also several other iconic sites. Chartwell, Churchill’s country home in Kent, is owned by the National Trust. Perhaps inevitably, the Churchill presented to visitors is a domesticized and depoliticized version. The military Churchill is more in evidence at the Cabinet War Rooms, the Whitehall bunker off St James’s Park, which were opened to the public in 1984. Of all the Churchill lieux de mémoire, one of the most remarkable is the US National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, the location of the 1946 ‘iron curtain’ speech. It is housed in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury. Ruined by the London Blitz, the church was subsequently reconstructed on the campus of Westminster College. In the years since his retirement and death, many American politicians have sought to make use of his reputation for their own purposes or to cast themselves in his image. Especially noteworthy was the way in which President George W. Bush placed an Epstein bust of Churchill, loaned by the British government, prominently within the Oval Office. Churchill has been represented many times on the screen, including many fictional treatments. Arguably the greatest cinema portrayal was by Simon Ward in Young Winston (1972) and the best TV characterization was by Albert Finney in The Gathering Storm (2002). In artistic terms, these are superb, but although they do show Churchill as a complex figure, they ultimately reinforce rather than challenge his myth. On the other hand, stage plays such as Rolf Hochhuth’s Soldiers (1968) and Howard Brenton’s The Churchill Play (1974) were deliberately iconoclastic. The contrast between screen and theatre portrayals is probably a good reflection of how Churchill stands today. He remains a saleable brand – even the most trivial historical ‘revelation’ is considered newsworthy – and also, to many, a hero. Yet, in line with his reputation during his own lifetime, he is nowhere an uncontested hero, even if the contestation remains a minority pursuit.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Bédarida, François, Churchill, Paris, Fayard, 1999.

GERD KRUMEICH\n\nJoan of Arc fascinated the Europeans of her time well before she became the central figure in several twentieth-century films. Both she herself and her military exploits attracted extensive commentary. Seen either as a saint or a sorceress depending on standpoints or eras, she was belatedly acknowledged by the Church and by France, which turned her into an icon. Joan of Arc was a European figure well before she became a French national heroine. This young peasant girl from Lorraine, who was probably born around 1412, was seventeen or so when she became one of the most feared and hated figures in Europe − as well as one of the most admired, venerated and loved. This was the Europe of the Holy Roman Church, or what Joan herself understood as the Ecclesia militans − the Church Militant − an active force in the world as opposed to the Ecclesia triumphans, the universal and timeless kingdom of God. And, as a Church Militant, it was the principal power in Europe, a power before which emperors, kings and princes, whatever their origins, had to bend the knee if they wanted to avoid eternal damnation. The Church had the last word on all matters concerning man’s relationship with God and also played a central role in agreements between the ruling princes of the time. One day, that seventeen-year-old girl, the uneducated daughter of a peasant family from Domrémy, came knocking at the door of secular power. This was embodied in the person of Robert de Baudricourt, captain of the garrison at Vaucouleurs, the chief town in the region. Claiming to have heard voices, she declared that God Himself had given her the mission of assisting the dauphin, Charles, France’s rightful king, to claim his throne. To this end, she sought an audience with the king so that together they could raise an army with which she would liberate the city of Orléans, besieged by the English. She also wanted to bring the king to Reims to be crowned so that decades of quarrels to determine France’s legitimate sovereign would be ended by the coronation of Charles VII.\n\n‘SENT BY GOD’ After some equivocation, Baudricourt finally acceded to this request. The king’s situation seemed desperate, but the Lord was known to move in mysterious ways and He too was sometimes pleased to let the weaker side win in an unequal contest.\n\n26\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nCharles and his court doubtless shared this view. At his request, high-ranking Church dignitaries met at Poitiers to deliberate over the claims made by the Pucelle. They came to the following conclusion: The King, given his necessity and that of his kingdom, and considering the continuous prayers of his poor people to God and to all others who love peace and justice, ought not to turn away nor reject the Maid who says she is sent by God for his succor, even though her promises consist only of human works.1 The conclusions of the expert commission were transmitted in writing to the courts of Europe, as confirmed by the Chronicle written at the same time by Eberhard of Windecken, who took his quotations from the document. The phenomenon reoccurred with the famous ‘Letter to the English’ sent by Joan, then still in Poitiers, to the Duke of Bedford, who was serving as regent of France. Headed with the words Jhesus Maria, the letter contained the following statements: King of England and you, Duke of Bedford, who call yourself Regent of the Kingdom of France; you, William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; John, Lord of Talbot; and you, Thomas, Lord Scales, who call yourselves Bedford’s lieutenants, do right by the King of Heaven. Hand over to the Maiden, who is sent here by God the King of Heaven, the keys to all the towns which you have taken and violated in France. She has come here in the name of God to support the Royal family. She is quite prepared to make peace, if you are willing to do right, so long as you give up France and make amends for occupying it.2\n\nA EUROPEAN MATTER A German translation of this letter was also in circulation at the time, contributing to the process of ‘Europeanizing’ the history of the Maid of Orléans. Joan’s great exploits were definitively established as a European event shortly afterwards, when she effectively lifted the siege of Orléans with a (limited) number of noblemen faithful to the French king and their entourage. Yet she was also spurred on by the enthusiasm and active participation of the common people and the bourgeoisie. She practically drove the English troops before her on her way to Reims, urging uncooperative towns to give up their keys to her. Finally, on 18 July 1429, Joan arrived in Reims, where the king’s coronation immediately took place. She was then at the height of her success; her character and incredible feats were the focus of discussion all over Europe, gaining a mythical status. Here is an eloquent example taken from the previously mentioned contemporary chronicle written by Eberhard of Windecken: Item, when the King was crowned at Reims, there were a great many people around the city, outside among the vineyards, who ruined all the vines with their horses and by other means. And shortly after the King had left Reims and gone on his way, all the vines reappeared and began once more to flourish,\n\nJOAN THE ICONIC!\n\n27\n\nproducing more grapes than ever before so that they had to be left, even until Saint Martin’s Day.3 We form some idea of the widespread enthusiasm that the Maid inspired in other European countries through a letter sent from Reims, probably on 16 July 1429, by Jean Desch, the municipal secretary of the Free Imperial City of Metz, to an unnamed high-ranking dignitary. He gives a detailed report of the deliverance of the cities of Troyes and Châlons, and of the hopes of the people of Reims just before the arrival of Joan and the royal army. According to his fanciful account, Joan would be accompanied by thirty-three thousand mounted troops and forty thousand infantrymen. And after describing at some length the heroic deeds performed by the Maid and the irresistible fascination she exerted, Desch adds, ‘Many knights are leaving these German lands for Reims, where they want to see the Dauphin.’4 In Italy, too, these events clearly gave rise to substantial commentaries. This is particularly evident from the records kept by Antonio Morosini, a member of the Great Council of the Republic of Venice, whose Journal contains copies of numerous business letters and informative accounts sent home by Venetian merchants and aristocrats from France and elsewhere. Page after page reveals the immense fascination and admiration − but also the scepticism – aroused everywhere by Joan of Arc’s prophecies and her military feats and triumphs. We include just one example, in the form of an extract from a long letter sent from Bruges on 10 May 1429 by the nobleman Marco Giustiani to his father in Venice. He begins by recounting in detail all the talk he has heard of the liberation of Orléans by the royal troops and of a maiden, who had guarded sheep, born near the borders of Lorraine. A month and a half ago she went to the dauphin, wanting to speak with him alone, to the exclusion of anyone else; and in sum, she revealed to him that God had sent her to him, and told him that between that day and the feast of Saint John in the month of June he would certainly enter Paris [. . .] indeed, I do not know what I should believe of the things I have been told, save that God’s power is great.5\n\nSAINT OR SORCERESS Although the deeds performed by Joan were astonishing, every Christian at the time believed them to be possible, God being the master of the world. The only problem was that the devil too had the power to lead men into temptation, inducing them to commit monstrous acts. These questions were much debated at her trial in 1431, but scholars throughout Europe were likewise striving to identify the plausible aspects, the truths and the falsehoods. The thoughts expressed by Heinrich von Gorkum, a doctor of theology at the University of Cologne, are revealing in this respect. He probably recorded them in June 1429, during the period when the Maid was achieving her military victories between Orléans and Reims. He mentions the fact that the question of whether Joan was a saint or a witch was debated ‘everywhere’. While it was said that she\n\n28\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nunquestionably possessed the qualities of a military leader and handled weapons with great skill, this could also be the work of the devil, which explains Gorkum’s uncertainty over the subject. He does, however, assert that God could never have ordered Joan to wear male clothing. The fall of Joan of Arc came shortly afterwards. We will set aside the question of whether this was due to treachery or hubris. She was convicted of heresy by an ecclesiastical tribunal composed exclusively of French dignitaries from the University of Paris and overseen by the ‘secular arm’ in the form of the English lords in Normandy, where she had been imprisoned. She was burnt alive on 30 May 1431. The conviction and execution of Joan of Arc also had European dimensions. On 8 June 1431, a week after the execution, the English king Henry VI (who was also king of France) sent a long letter to the representatives of ‘all the Christian nations’, in other words, the kings, princes and religious dignitaries of Europe. He asserted that in pursuing Joan of Arc and putting her to death, he had worked for the good of the whole Christian world, which was imperilled by such heresies. All who had participated in the trial would also be protected from possible attacks by Joan’s supporters, who ‘would unlawfully try, or seek to try, out of hatred, vengeance or for other reasons, to undermine the true judgements of our Holy Mother the Church’.6 It has been effectively established that these letters were sent to the Emperor Sigismund, the kings of Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, Denmark, Scotland and Poland, the rulers of Milan, the doges of Venice and the city of Genoa,7 suggesting that Henry felt a strong need to justify himself.\n\nA SHAKESPEARIAN CHARACTER A little later, however, the incredible story of Joan of Arc left the collective memory and was transformed into a vague myth discussed only in erudite circles, as a historical curiosity. Joan gradually came to be regarded as a confirmation of the French monarchy’s divine right to rule − when she was not seen as an instrument manipulated by powerful lords or as a stratagem of war as understood by Niccolò Machiavelli, the most celebrated author of the day. The memory retained in England of the deeds performed by Joan, which had been so detrimental to the country, were characterized by negation and hatred. The letter sent by Henry VI cited earlier was included in the works of sixteenth-century historians such as Edward Hall and Raphael Holinshed. They were the principal sources used by William Shakespeare for his play Henry VI, in which Joan is given characteristics that played an extremely important role in the tradition associated with her. Presented there as a witch, she becomes ‘Joan Puzel’, an allusion both to her virginity (La Pucelle) and to her enigmatic, puzzling character, while her supporters are seen as allying themselves with the devil. It is not specified whether she was a shepherdess or a serving girl (with the bad company that implied), although it is true that she could have been both at once. Shakespeare is relatively untroubled by historical accuracy here; in the play, the English general Lord John Talbot,\n\nJOAN THE ICONIC!\n\n29\n\nwhom she defeated, dies before Joan, although he probably survived her by twenty years. Above all, he would have thought it important to show that she was finally abandoned by the evil spirits that had guided her − indeed, she had even discredited her voices and repudiated her misdeeds shortly before her death. This standpoint places him squarely within the traditional English narrative relating to Joan. Shakespeare finally has her dishonour herself by using a cushion to feign pregnancy in order to avoid being burnt at the stake. This act, together with the fact that the child has several possible fathers, arouses general derision among the characters in the play. According to Shakespeare, who followed English historical sources on the subject, France therefore owed its victory to a sorceress and a strumpet.\n\nSCHILLER VERSUS VOLTAIRE This derision was echoed throughout Europe during the ‘Classical’ era. It surely found its most vivid expression in Voltaire’s La Pucelle d’Orléans. This long satirical poem, which first appeared in 1762, had already been circulating around Europe since the 1730s, when it was written, and was on everyone’s lips. Unauthorized, abridged or forged versions were published in a number of European cities as of 1755. No fewer than ten different editions had appeared before 1762 in London alone; by 1797, twenty others had emerged. Europe laughed heartily at the image of that virgin sitting astride the winged ass that carried her away to adventures in an aristocratic world rife with criminality and infamy. This was a world that had lost its bearings and where everyone was sleeping together in one way or another. The important point to remember here, however, is that Voltaire was certainly less concerned with presenting the Maid as an object of ridicule than with lampooning the institutions that had surrounded her in her lifetime. These had been just as responsible for her death as for her future rehabilitation as the servant of an ‘absolute’ monarch. Of course, although Voltaire’s Pucelle was clearly a major European cultural event, the poem was resolutely countered by a number of other works. We note just one example here: Friedrich Schiller’s The Maid of Orléans. The public reacted with intense emotion to this play, which was performed for the first time in 1801. It reflected a new spirit, based on the ‘Romantic’ treatment of the subject, where the emphasis was as much on love and humanity as on personal heroism and the spirit of self-sacrifice. Between its creation and the late 1850s there were no fewer than 252 different productions of the tragedy, many of which were presented in France and other European countries.\n\nPOLITICAL JOAN During the nineteenth century, an age of nationalism, Joan of Arc was likewise the focus of a new and unprecedented form of ‘nationalization’. Elevated by France’s Liberal and Romantic historians, she had become the embodiment of the people and was seen as initiating the process through which they obtained their freedom,\n\n30\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nculminating in the French Revolution. In this way, the Maid quickly became a bone of contention between the French ‘Left’ and ‘Right’. While for the Left Joan was (as she often still is) a heroine of the people, betrayed by her king and burnt alive by the Church, the Right saw her as the instrument of God, who had used this means to demonstrate that the French monarchy was truly sacred in His eyes. When the royalist star finally faded in the 1870s, the way was likewise clear for the Church to acknowledge that Joan of Arc had indeed been wrongfully convicted and executed. In 1869, the bishops of France, headed by Monseigneur Félix Dupanloup, bishop of Orléans, petitioned the Vatican to initiate the process of her beatification, as Joan of Arc had engaged in wholehearted combat for her faith and had consequently suffered the death of a true martyr. The long-drawn-out procedure was interrupted on several occasions, the last of these being the First World War, after which it was rapidly concluded. And on 16 May 1920, Joan was canonized by the Vatican. Just one week later, on 24 May, the Chamber of Deputies (known as the ‘Blue Horizon Chamber’) decided to establish a national holiday in her honour, following a proposal by Maurice Barrès. This dual operation set the seal, as it were, on a new understanding between the Catholic Church and the French Republic, which was now ready to accept Conservative Catholics as an integral part of its political landscape. Yet, through her canonization and the public holiday inaugurated for her, the Maid became both a national and a global saint, making it harder for both the Left and the extreme nationalist forces of the 1920s and 1930s to instrumentalize her. Interestingly, after the First World War, when Joan of Arc had only minor importance as a subject of political debate, she regained her status as a figure in world literature for the first time since Schiller. George Bernard Shaw’s play Saint Joan (1923) is both empathetic and full of bitter irony. It still remains an exemplary work of poetic reflection on the power of free thinking and the annihilation of individual greatness by the bureaucratic obligation to save souls. While Joan was seen by Shaw as ‘one of the first Protestant martyrs’, her story is presented as a social parable in various adaptations by Bertolt Brecht: Saint Joan of the Stockyards, The Visions of Simone Machard and the Trial of Joan of Arc at Rouen, 1431. Brecht was particularly concerned with the relationship between power and faith, and between individual protest and social constraints. The Trial of Joan of Arc at Rouen contains a number of extracts from the records of the proceedings, attesting to the perennial influence still exerted by Joan today through the statements she made at her trial in 1431.\n\nA MODERN HEROINE In the 1900s, Joan of Arc’s story was also adopted by that then-new medium, the cinema. Between 1898 and 1928, she was the subject of six movies. The year 1928 saw the release of the silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc, by the Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer. This portrayal of a defenceless, yet noble and fearless individual surrounded by hate-filled, implacable powers and dogmatic Church\n\nJOAN THE ICONIC!\n\n31\n\nauthorities intent on her destruction has had a lasting global impact. It has made even more of a mark than Otto Preminger’s 1957 drama Saint Joan (starring Jean Seberg) or Victor Fleming’s Joan of Arc (1948), which starred Ingrid Bergman, in a performance overly inclined towards pathos, clad in cumbersome armour. Joan’s story was brought to the big screen again in the 1990s. Jacques Rivette certainly created a unique atmosphere with his Jeanne la Pucelle (Joan the Maiden, 1994), but his limited budget made it impossible for him to include the all-important action scenes; this was something that Luc Besson achieved with great success in his Jeanne d’Arc (The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, 1999), although neither movie has the makings of a classic. Besson’s film shows too little regard for historical accuracy; Joan’s conflicted conscience, for instance, is a complete fabrication, as is the portrayal of her accuser, Bishop Cauchon, as a benevolent figure with her interests very much at heart. This brief glimpse of the filmography devoted to the Maid of Orléans confirms Joan of Arc’s status as a ‘transnational’ character, something she effectively became in the twentieth century. Her reach now extends well beyond the European collective memory. As we have seen with the few examples cited here, Joan’s story has long been of interest to historians, writers and directors. That interest has spread as far as Japan. In the 1960s she was the focus of an exhibition held in Tokyo that attracted much attention; she has now become a manga and video game heroine, presented as a heroic young girl who emerges victorious from all kinds of battles with monsters and dangerous characters of every description. Joan of Arc, a major figure in European memory, is now firmly established in the cultural memory of humanity.\n\nNOTES 1. Joan of Arc: The Early Debate, Deborah A.

With these words, Alfred Jarry introduced the first act of his play Ubu roi (1896). Its chief character, the crazed François Ubu, aspires to the throne of Poland, a land by then deprived of its statehood. Marie Curie (née Skłodowska) and Rozalia − known as ‘Rosa’ − Luxemburg left that very same ‘no-man’s land’ for the Western European cities of Paris and Berlin, where they would make a lasting impact on science, politics and the perception of women. Their personalities could not have been more different – Marie was rather timid, Rosa, larger than life. Yet this has had no bearing on their accession to the pantheon of great European figures inscribed in the collective imaginary. Both worked relentlessly to establish themselves, an imperative in that male-dominated time. The research conducted by Marie Curie − and by her husband, the physicist Pierre Curie – continued the work carried out by Henri Becquerel, who, in 1896, had demonstrated that uranium emitted radiation. Working with minute attention to detail and in extremely hazardous conditions, Marie Curie and her husband applied themselves to discovering other elements that also released radiation. The two researchers succeeded in their investigations with the aid of an electrometer developed by Pierre. They discovered polonium and radium and coined the evocative term ‘radioactivity’ to denote the emission of radiation in the form of rays or particles. Her revolutionary work on radiation earned Marie Curie the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics. The first woman to become a Nobel Laureate, she shared the award with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel. In 1911, she received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The reception of her Treatise on Radioactivity (1910), a reference work on the emerging research into radiation, extended well beyond France. Despite these\n\n34\n\nUNITED AND DIVIDED EUROPES\n\nindisputable distinctions, her application to become a member of the Académie des sciences was rejected due to the gender-based prejudices of that institution. No woman was admitted into its illustrious circle until 1979, when the mathematician Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was elected to become a full member. Yet Marie Curie attached little importance to such accolades. A born scientist, she devoted her life to discovering medical uses for radioactivity. The research institutes she founded in Paris and Warsaw have remained at the forefront of this domain. Following long years of research on radioactive substances, she died of leukaemia in 1934. One of Europe’s most prestigious fellowship programmes, intended to enhance researcher mobility, bears her name today. Rosa Luxemburg also had a remarkable destiny. Her tireless commitment to creating a better world, particularly for the international working class, coupled with her resistance to the warmongering pursued in her era, led to several years of imprisonment. This did not break her resolve. She co-founded the Communist Party of Germany (the KPD), and her convictions led her to join the anti-monarchist revolution of November 1918. This act resulted in her assassination, a few months later, by members of the Freikorps. The Nazis lost no time in dismantling Rosa Luxemburg’s political legacy, beginning with the burning of her works after they came to power in 1933. And in 1935, they destroyed the memorial to the Spartacist uprising that stood in Berlin’s Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery and had been partly dedicated to her.\n\nTWO CHARACTERS FOR THE BIG SCREEN The lives of these two women have great narrative potential, which has been exploited in a number of films. In Margarethe von Trotta’s Rosa Luxemburg (1985), the actor Barbara Sukowa emphasizes Luxemburg’s feisty nature and the difficulties in her relationship with the activist Leo Jogiches. The latter, crushed by his companion’s growing fame, embarks on numerous affairs. Marie Curie’s love life likewise drew attention away from her career; after Pierre’s death she began an affair with the physicist Paul Langevin, a married man. Their relationship came to light in 1911 and the popular press pounced on the story, even going to far as to publish the couple’s correspondence. Marie was portrayed as a foreign homewrecker and her reputation remained tarnished for quite some time. Marie Curie’s rehabilitation occurred in the 1920s, thanks to the American journalist Marie Meloney. Keen to support her research, Meloney organized a fundraising operation and invited the scientist to embark on a lecture tour in the United States. She launched a vast press campaign, presenting Marie’s career as an exemplary triumph and highlighting her tireless fight against cancer. Marie Curie was also the subject of a posthumous tribute in the form of the Hollywood movie Madame Curie (1943). This makes no mention of her relationship with Langevin, concentrating instead on her love for Pierre and her passion for research. The year 1995 marked the high point in the construction of the legend, when the ashes of\n\nINTERSECTING DESTINIES\n\n35\n\nPierre and Marie Curie were transferred to the Panthéon. François Mitterrand invited the Polish president Lech Wałęsa to Paris for the occasion. Marie had retained her concern for the Polish cause throughout her life in her adopted land; the eightyfourth element of the periodic table was given the name ‘polonium’ as a sign of her deep attachment to the country of her birth. According to the results of an opinion poll carried out in January 20031 in Europe’s six most highly populated countries (Germany, France, Poland, Spain, Italy and the UK), Marie Curie was the second most iconic figure in Europe. She placed before Charles de Gaulle and only Winston Churchill was ranked before her. It is impossible to present such a consistent and idealized memorial portrait of Rosa Luxemburg. She is virtually unknown in Poland, although anti-Communist feeling, which was particularly vehement after 1989, is not sufficient in itself to explain this. The lack of knowledge about her may equally be attributed to the fact that, unlike Marie Curie, Rosa Luxemburg argued from a postnational perspective and was not specifically committed to the cause of Polish independence. However, it is important to emphasize that she is one of the few revolutionary figures whose legacy was not only claimed by the 1968 movement but also survived the collapse of ‘Real Socialism’. Her maxim, ‘Freedom is always, and exclusively, freedom for the one who thinks differently’, represented a threat to the uniform thinking and repressive machinery of the Communist parties east of the Berlin Wall, distinguishing her stance from Lenin’s anti-democratic approach. And while busts and statues of Lenin were destroyed after 1989, public squares and political foundations bear her name today. One such organization is the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, which has close connections with the left-wing Die Linke party. Social problems and nationalism seem likely to be ongoing issues.\n\nNOTE 1.

With his countless talents and the aura of mystery that continues to surround him, he seems to mirror today’s creative energies, as the precursor of so many aspects of modern life. In 2003, a polling institute conducted a survey in six different countries (Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Italy and Poland) to find out which historical figure was thought to be the best embodiment of ‘European identity’. Leonardo da Vinci won by a considerable margin, ranking before Christopher Columbus and Winston Churchill. The remarkable thing about his score was that there was only a very slight connection between the nationality of those polled and the results. Although most of the Italians chose Dante Alighieri, the British, William Shakespeare, the Spanish, Miguel de Cervantes and the Germans, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, only Leonardo garnered the majority of European votes as a whole. How might we explain the tremendous fame of the individual described by Jules Michelet as ‘Faust’s Italian brother’? First, by remembering that ever since his death he has been regarded as the personification of genius and of the Renaissance, in the heroic mode as a superhuman intelligence and as a tragic figure with Promethean ambitions; both carry within them an aspiration towards universality. This encapsulates the significance of a remarkable destiny; it led to an engineer who executed commissions of every kind for princely courts becoming the incarnation of Universal Man in the era of Humanism.\n\nINVENTING LEONARDO Historically speaking, this was Leonardo’s ingenium; he possessed the extraordinary art of being in the right place at the right time, thereby bringing about his own meteoric social ascension. Born in 1452 in Vinci, near Florence, Leonardo, the\n\nLEONARDO\n\n37\n\nillegitimate son of a local Tuscan notary, died near Amboise, in the manor house at Cloux gifted to him by François I, king of France. The latter is said to have wept when told of the death of the elderly master. Today, Le Clos-Lucé is one of Europe’s principal sites of memory associated with Leonardo, together with the Leonardo da Vinci Museum, the museums of technology in Milan and Florence, and the major art museums that hold the few paintings he left, most of them unfinished. The majority may be found in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and the Louvre in Paris, but others are held in Milan, London, Munich, Krakow, Saint Petersburg and Washington, DC. Le Clos-Lucé contains a museum where visitors can see reconstructions of some of Leonardo’s famous ‘devices’. These include a diving suit, ball bearings, a parachute, a metal rolling mill, a canal lock and a bicycle; is there anything he didn’t invent? When speaking to the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini, François I is said to have declared: ‘Leonardo da Vinci is not only an excellent painter, but a true Archimedes.’ ‘Leonardo’s inventions’ have been celebrated since the nineteenth century as advances in European technical engineering − yet who invented the figure of Leonardo himself? His successive biographers and admirers obviously did so, but Leonardo was able to ensure that his own life became a permanent spectacle of ever-developing renown. In 1467, Leonardo began an apprenticeship at Andrea del Verrocchio’s bottega in Florence. At that time, a bottega was a laboratory for technical activity as well as an artists’ workshop, and Verrocchio’s was certainly the most prestigious in Italy. There Leonardo rubbed shoulders with the future great masters of the fifteenthcentury Central Italian tradition: Domenico Ghirlandaio, Pietro Perugino and Sandro Botticelli.
