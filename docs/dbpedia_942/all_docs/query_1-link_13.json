        "text": "In the last ten to fifteen years development-led archaeology has boosted the number of prospections and subsequent excavations in the Netherlands. Despite the number of excavations and the availability of much data little is known with regard to the actual gain of knowledge in connection to the wide range of research questions and topics of the National Archaeological Research Agenda. This book reports on a synthetic analysis of reports produced in the context of development-led projects over the past 10-15 years and concerning the early prehistory of the Netherlands. The degree to which development-led work permits to take major steps forward is highly variable. A limited number of topics has profited from the generated data, and in some cases development-led research has shown to be on the forefront of innovative approaches. A larger number of topics and research questions, however, appear to remain unanswerable; data have been generated, but remain of an anecdotal nature. This volume discusses various issues with regard to the gain of knowledge regarding the early prehistory of the Netherlands, and identifies problems, yet also provides possible solutions. This scientific report is aimed at archaeologists and other professionals occupied with Archaeology. With knowledge and advice the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands gives the future a past.\n\nIn 1992, the member states of the Council of Europe co-signed the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage in Valletta (Malta) This has led to the development-led archaeology in many countries, also in the Netherlands, especially from 2001 onwards. But has Development-led archaeology been able to generate new knowledge about the past? Has increased prospection and excavation activity payed of? Should we continue in the same style, or should we formulate new kinds of research questions? These are the kinds of questions that the present book aims to discuss. The main goal is to assess the gain in knowledge resulting from development-led archaeology, notably for remains of the period 2850-1500 cal BC: the Late Neolithic, the Early Bronze Age and the start of the Middle Bronze Age. We know this period very well from burial mounds and bronze hoards. Bronze objects and burial assemblages are widely discussed in international literature, for the Bell Beaker period even with the Netherlands as a typological role model. The question we raise in this book is whether development-led archaeology has confirmed this picture, or whether large scale excavations in ‘Malta-context’ have generated other types of evidence. Have we been able to detect houses from these periods, or settlements? Are these comparable for all regions or are there regional differences? Do we have indications for social stratification; for migrations? The answers to such questions are hidden in the many reports that development-led archaeology has produced in the last 15 years. The problem is that so many site reports have been, that it is a large task to synthesise these data and translate them into coherent models. Therefor the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE) commissioned the authors to go over all the data assembled in the last 15 years, present them to the wider public in a synthesised form, and answer a number of research questions. Because these data are published in Dutch language site reports, this book has been written in English to make the data available to a European (scientific) public. Relevant sites have all been summarised in Chapter 7, which therefore has become the central part of this publication. A synthesis of the Dutch data was formulated in Chapter 8, demonstrating that especially settlement evidence has dramatically changed our perception of the period. The traditional image based on burial data needs to be altered completely. This has implications for the international discourse on the Beaker period as well. The book ends with a large number of methodical and theoretical avenues that can be followed to gain more knowledge in the next fifteen years of development-led archaeology. We plea for a far more integrated approach between all specialists involved in archaeological excavation and post-excavation analysis. Only then we will be really able to generate new knowledge about the past.\n\nT he ongoing transcription, translation, and publication of the colonial Dutch records of New Netherland is of critical importance to both historians and archaeologists. Archaeologists are specialized historians who use, in addition to documents, the buried physical evidence of the New Netherland Dutch. Archaeological sites are a vast primary source of information that is not available anywhere else. Archaeological artifacts and the contexts from which they are excavated provide a more complete understanding of New Netherland than scholars can possibly obtain in the limited extant documents. Excavations at Dutch sites beginning in the early 1970s have already produced new insights and new sources of information. However, archaeological sites, like documents, are not infinite in number. They are vulnerable to destruction through new development, and whenever destruction cannot be avoided, it must be a priority to conduct excavations and rescue all possible information. Archaeological excavation is itself the carefully controlled destruction of a site, and sites that have been protected and set aside on public land should be excavated only when a project is well-funded and when there are well-defined, specific research goals. These sites are non-renewable resources; unlike documents, they cannot be re-read and re-translated. The collections that they yield (consisting of artifacts, field records, and other documentation) are sources that should be carefully curated and made available to future generations of scholars for study and interpretation. This essay examines the current state of archaeological work on New Netherland and the many research possibilities still available to archaeologists and historians."
