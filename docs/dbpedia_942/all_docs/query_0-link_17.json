Examples of the latest scientific results and technical developments, across the whole breadth of the research fields covered at PSI, are presented in short articles, supplemented by the most important statistical data. The Report is written in English, \"by scientists for scientists\". For the more general public, the Institute publishes \"Fenster zur Forschung\" in German, in which selected research topics are presented in a popular form."
