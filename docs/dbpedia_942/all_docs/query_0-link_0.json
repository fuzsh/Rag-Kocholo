        "text": "Northeasternmost province of the Netherlands\n\nProvince of the Netherlands\n\nGroningen ( GROH-ning-ən, GRON-ing-ən,[5][6] Dutch: [ˈɣroːnɪŋə(n)] ⓘ; Gronings: Grunn; West Frisian: Grinslân) is the northeasternmost province of the Netherlands. It borders on Friesland to the west, Drenthe to the south, the German state of Lower Saxony to the east, and the Wadden Sea to the north. As of January 2023, Groningen had a population of about 596,000,[7] and a total area of 2,955 km2 (1,141 sq mi).\n\nHistorically the area was at different times part of Frisia, the Frankish Empire, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Dutch Republic, the precursor state of the modern Netherlands. In the 14th century, the city of Groningen became a member of the Hanseatic League.\n\nThe provincial capital and the largest city in the province is the city of Groningen (231,299 inhabitants[8]). Since 2016, René Paas has been the King's Commissioner in the province. A coalition of GroenLinks, the Labour Party, ChristianUnion, People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, Democrats 66, and Christian Democratic Appeal forms the executive branch. The province is divided into 10 municipalities.\n\nThe land is mainly used for agriculture. There are seaports in Delfzijl and Eemshaven. The Groningen gas field, one of the world's largest, was discovered in 1959. The province is home to the University of Groningen and Hanze University of Applied Sciences.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGroningen was originally a part of Frisia. It became a part of the Frankish Empire around 785. Charlemagne assigned the Christianization of this new possession to Ludger.\n\nIn the 11th century, the city of Groningen was a village in Drenthe that belonged to the Bishopric of Utrecht, while most of the province was in the Prince-Bishopric of Münster.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, central control was remote, and the city of Groningen acted as a city-state, exerting a dominating influence on the surrounding Ommelanden. In the 14th century, Groningen became one of the towns within the Hanseatic League.[9] In the years after, Groningen expanded its influence. At its peak almost all of the current province Friesland was under the influence and control of Groningen.\n\nShortly before 1498, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor gave Groningen and Friesland to Albert III, Duke of Saxony, who could however not establish permanent control. In 1514/15 Groningen came to the Duchy of Guelders, and in 1536 as the Lordship of Groningen to the Habsburg Netherlands.\n\nIn 1594, Groningen was conquered from the Spanish by the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, precursor state of the Netherlands, to which it belonged henceforth.\n\nDuring World War II, the Netherlands were occupied by Nazi Germany. In April 1945, the 2nd Canadian Division fought in the Battle of Groningen, which resulted in the liberation of the city and in the death of 130, the capture of 5,212, and the fleeing of 2,000 German soldiers. In May 1945, another 3,000 German soldiers were captured in the Battle of Delfzijl by the 5th Canadian Division, after which all of the northern provinces were liberated.[10]\n\nEast Groningen was the scene of a particularly fierce class struggle in the 19th and 20th centuries. Perhaps not coincidentally, Groningen boasts the only municipality (Beerta) where the Communist Party of the Netherlands has ever had a mayor (Hanneke Jagersma).[11]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nGroningen is situated at in the northeast of the Netherlands. To the west is the province Friesland, to the south is the province Drenthe, to the east the German districts are Leer and Emsland in the state Lower Saxony, and to the north the North Sea, Ems, and Dollart. The northernmost point of the Netherlands is on Rottumerplaat[12] at ; the easternmost point of the Netherlands is in Bad Nieuweschans[12] at .\n\nGroningen is the 7th largest province of the Netherlands. It has a total area of 2,955 km2 (1,141 sq mi), with 2,316 km2 (894 sq mi) of land and 639 km2 (247 sq mi) of water. About 80% of the land or 1,876 km2 (724 sq mi) is used for agriculture. The rest of the land is: 9% or 158 km2 (61 sq mi) of built-up or semi built-up area, 6% or 144 km2 (56 sq mi) of nature, 3% or 66 km2 (25 sq mi) of infrastructure, and 2% or 43 km2 (17 sq mi) of recreational area.[13]\n\nThe land in Groningen is flat. A large area of the province is below sea level.[14] The Hasseberg near Sellingen of 14.6 m (48 ft) above sea level is the highest point.[15]\n\nThe Groningen gas field near Slochteren is the 8th largest[16] natural gas field in the world. Since 1986, the exploitation of this gas field has caused earthquakes in the region with magnitudes up to 3.6.[17]\n\nIn the Wadden Sea of Groningen, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009,[18] are the sandbank Simonszand and the natural reserve Rottum consisting of the three uninhabited islands Rottumeroog, Rottumerplaat, and Zuiderduintjes. The national park Lauwersmeer (IUCN category II) is located on the border between Groningen and Friesland.\n\nSubdivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe province of Groningen is also called Stad en Ommelanden, which means the city of Groningen and its surrounding lands, which are the historical regions of Fivelingo, Hunsingo, Oldambt, Westerkwartier, and Westerwolde.[19]\n\nThe province (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics or NUTS level 2) is divided into three COROP regions (NUTS level 3): East Groningen, Delfzijl and surroundings, and the rest of Groningen. The COROP regions are used for statistical purposes.[20]\n\nThe province is also divided into ten municipalities, each with its own local government. Currently, Groningen is the most populated and most densely populated municipality,[21][22] containing the largest city.[22]\n\nMunicipality Population[21] Total Area[22] Population density[21][22] COROP Region Eemsdelta Delfzijl and surroundings Groningen 233,273 197.96 km2 (76.43 sq mi) 1,257/km2 (3,260/sq mi) Rest of Groningen Het Hogeland Rest of Groningen Midden-Groningen Rest of Groningen Oldambt 38,277 295.96 km2 (114.27 sq mi) 169/km2 (440/sq mi) East Groningen Pekela 12,176 50.20 km2 (19.38 sq mi) 248/km2 (640/sq mi) East Groningen Stadskanaal 31,754 119.94 km2 (46.31 sq mi) 270/km2 (700/sq mi) East Groningen Veendam 27,417 78.68 km2 (30.38 sq mi) 361/km2 (930/sq mi) East Groningen Westerkwartier Rest of Groningen Westerwolde East Groningen\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe province of Groningen has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb).\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±% p.a.1899 299,602— 1930 392,436+0.87%1942 430,271+0.77%1950 459,819+0.83%1960 474,657+0.32%1965 497,472+0.94%1970 517,305+0.78%1975 536,106+0.72%1980 553,709+0.65%1985 561,119+0.27%1990 553,862−0.26%1995 557,995+0.15%2000 562,646+0.17%2005 575,072+0.44%2010 576,668+0.06%2015 582,649+0.21%2020 585,866+0.11%Source: CBS[24][25][26][27]\n\nOn 1 January 2023, the province of Groningen had a population of 596,075 and a population density of 257/km2 (670/sq mi), which make it the 9th most populous province and 8th most densely populated province of the Netherlands.[13][28] The city of Groningen is the most populous city in the province and the 6th most populous city in the Netherlands.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, 92.2% of the total provincial population was born in the Netherlands; and of the 7.8% that was born abroad, the ten most common foreign countries of origin are the neighbour Germany (1.09%), the former colonies and dependencies Indonesia (0.60%), Netherlands Antilles and Aruba (0.55%), Suriname (0.54%), and other countries Turkey (0.41%), Soviet Union (0.36%), China (0.32%), Poland (0,26%), Yugoslavia (0.26%), and United Kingdom (0.18%).[29]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, 18.7% of the population belonged to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands while 4.9% was Roman Catholic, 1.3% was Muslim and 6.7% belonged to other churches or faiths. Over half (68.4%) of the population identified as non-religious.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Groningen is the economic center of the province.[31] In the 14th century, the city became a member of the Hanseatic League.[9] Currently some of the city's major employers[31] are University Medical Center Groningen with 12,141 employees,[32] University of Groningen with 5,591 employees,[33] Municipality of Groningen with 3,063 employees,[34] Education Implementation Service (DUO) with 2,000 employees,[35] and Gasunie with 1,748 employees.[36]\n\nThe other economically important area is the Ems delta with the sea ports of Delfzijl and Eemshaven.[31][37] In 2015, a total of 11,589 cargo vessels arrived at the two Groningen Seaports combined, 7,111 sea vessels and 4,478 inland vessels. The ports had a cargo throughput of 11,309,000 tonnes.[38] The chemical industry near Delfzijl is located at the Chemie Park in Farmsum, with factories of AkzoNobel, Lubrizol, and Teijin Aramid.[39] Both GDF Suez[40] and Vattenfall[41] have a natural gas-fired power plant in Eemshaven, and Essent[42] is building a coal-fired power plant there.\n\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 25 billion € in 2018, accounting for 3.2% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 37,300 € or 124% of the EU27 average in the same year.[43]\n\nIn 1959, the Groningen gas field near Slochteren was discovered,[44] and the NAM started to exploit the field in 1963.[17] This caused Dutch disease and induced earthquakes.\n\nIn 2013, Groningen had a labor force of 268,000 people and unemployment rate of 9.6%, which is the second highest unemployment for a province in the Netherlands.[45]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nGroningen is home to the Low Saxon dialect called Gronings (Grönnegs / Grunnegs in Gronings regional language), In the eastern part of Friesland variations of the Groninger 'language' is spoken. Gronings has local nuances, for example, the people in the eastern part speak Gronings with more German influence.[citation needed] Nowadays, many inhabitants of the province do not speak the dialect, especially in the city of Groningen where many outsiders have moved.\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditional dishes and delicacies from Groningen are boerenkoolstamppot, droge worst, krentjebrij, oudewijvenkoek, poffert, and spekdik.
