        "text": "What is a folk instrument is very much like the question \"what is folk music\"... it's a question that can be difficult to exactly define, and can be kind of subjective.\n\nI think this may be helpful:\n\nHere is Wiki's definition of \"folk music\".\n\nAnd here is Wiki's definition of \"folk instrument\".\n\n--\n\nSite Owner\n\nThose irritated by grain of sand best avoid beach.\n\n-Strumelia proverb c.1990\n\nWhat makes it a folk instrument? Being played by folks, of course! Not fancy musicianers or college educated theoreticians, or masters of stage.... just folks. Lol, but seriously I think that the interpersonal nature of folk tradition and instruction really defines a folk instrument, like Dusty said.\n\nI also think that, more importantly, folk music and folk instrument tend to be words that people self describe with, denoting a modesty and sincerity to either the style of music or to the instrument. The word \"folk\" tells me that I can expect music that is intimate and genuine and not under some allusion of being excessively formal or pretentious.\n\nupdated by @nate: 05/31/24 06:51:14PM\n\nI'll go along with three \"keys\" to being a folk instrument:\n\n(1) Not usually encountered in a standardized form, with variations limited to size and materials.\n\n(2) Not formally taught in conservatories (or equivalent) over a multi-year period.\n\n(3) Not typically used to play from written scores in standard notation.\n\nUsing an instrument to play \"folk music\" doesn't make it a \"folk instrument.\" Mozart played the country music of his day rather well, as I recall, and I think he jammed as well.\n\nThings get complicated, though. I think the Russian Balalaika is still probably classified as a folk instrument, although it fails all three of my tests.\n\nI think Dusty hits it square in the middle.\n\nBut an exploration of the edges brings me to feel \"folk\" vs \"some other kind\" is notional, communal, and somewhat conventional —and more than a bit bizarre and ultimately uninteresting. I remember the '90s, for instance when arguments raged about the 'rightness' of putting a 6-1/2 fret on a dulcimer. The addition robbed the dulcimer of its folk status for some people, and cast it into some undefined state in which they seemed to imagine the proponents wanted to play chords and render Broadway hits music, which outraged them.\n\nAnd that did come to pass! And some dulcimers are now commissioned as chromatic, not diatonic instruments at all. Blue Grass, jazz, renditions of classical music are arranged for dulcimers, either diatonic, altered diatonic or chromatice. DF#A is a well-known tuning scheme for playing Broadway musicals.\n\nAnother such edge is the status of the banjo, the ukulele, the African kalimba (thumb piano).\n\nThere are serious stylists and accomplished masters of all these instruments, yet only a few can walk onto a stage for an evening's solo concert and come away with much more cash than enough to pay their hotel and travel expenses.\n\nThat seems to imply another 'edge' to the consideration of whether an instrument is 'folk' or is somehow otherwise meant for 'serious' music —in other words, music people are willing to pay $50-$100 for a ticket.\n\nIn the world of rock, pop music, currently, people are paying truly fabulous amounts for leading singers and bands, while other very worthwhile, serious musicians keep squeaking by financially for the love of the music. Yet no consideration is in evidence about whether they are 'folk performers' or not. Is what Taylor Swift sings 'folk?' Nobody cares about the answer.\n\nIn sum, I think the love of the music is a much more interesting way to consider an instrument, those who play it, and the breadth of its repertoire, than whether it is a folk instrument. In the end, isn't any instrument available to and actively used by ordinary people a folk instrument?\n\nBTW, a good friend of mine is a master of the hammer dulcimer. She made her first mountain dulcimer in my basement—while playing the French horn in high school. And she may still have a French horn. I'll have to ask her sometime.\n\nupdated by @dwain-wilder: 05/31/24 05:09:35PM"
