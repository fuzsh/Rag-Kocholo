        "text": "Thomas Rhett appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert to perform his song “Angels,” offering an intimate rendition of the track from his recent album, Where We Started, which dropped April 1 via Valory Music. Backed by a six-piece band — including the emotive pedal steel of Whit Wright — Rhett delivered a distinctly country performance of the ballad. “Maybe angels don’t always have wings,” he sang in the payoff line.\n\nWhere We Started, featuring the single “Slow Down Summer” and a duet with Katy Perry on the title track, follows Rhett’s 2021 project Country Again: Side A — which was intended to serve as the first half of a double album. (Plans for Side B have not yet been announced.)\n\n“For me, there was probably a five- or six-year journey I was into a lot of different stuff, listening to a lot of different types of music and trying to make that uniquely me,” Rhett told Rolling Stone last year. “Once I started to slow down and look back at my life a little bit, I was like, ‘Dang, I haven’t really sat down with a guitar in a very long time and just tried to tell a real, honest story from the heart.’”\n\nRhett was recently nominated for Best Country Song for “Country Again” at the 2022 Grammys, but lost to Chris Stapleton’s “Cold."
