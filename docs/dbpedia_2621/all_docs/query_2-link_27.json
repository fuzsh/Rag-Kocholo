        "text": "Francesca Royster remembers waking up the morning after the Super Bowl to numerous excited text messages from friends: Beyoncé had just dropped two new country-tinged singles, and her forthcoming album—the second act in her purported Renaissance trilogy—would be a celebration of country music.\n\n“It’s awakened such a discussion,” says Royster, an English professor at DePaul University and author of the 2022 book Black Country Music. “Students, friends, old friends from college have been calling, wanting to talk about this topic that, for a long time, has felt like a closet obsession.”\n\nWhile many contemporary music listeners’ first experience with Black country music came with Lil’ Nas X’s 2018 “country-trap” novelty hit “Old Town Road,” Black folks have been writing, performing, and recording country music since it first became popular in the 1920s. In fact, country music wouldn’t exist as it does today without the contributions and innovations of Black musicians.\n\n“One of the biggest lies this nation has ever told is that Black people are not country,” wrote culture critic Taylor Crumpton in the days following Beyoncé’s announcement. “Black people have always lived in the country. It is where we prayed. It is where we sang. It is where we worshiped.”\n\nAs more young and emerging Black country artists receive critical attention and accolades, there’s hope that this represents a step toward a more inclusive representation of country music—rather than just a passing trend.\n\nCountry music’s legacy\n\nThe presence of Black folks in country music, while not quite universally acknowledged, is not exactly a secret. The distinctive sound of the Carter Family, the “First Family of Country Music,” was influenced in the 1920s by Lesley Riddle, a Black blues and gospel guitar player and folklorist. As a boy in the 1930s, Hank Williams learned his craft from Black guitar player Rufus “Tee Tot” Payne, just as Johnny Cash would learn from Black musician Gus Cannon some two decades later.\n\nBlack harmonica player DeFord Bailey was the first performer on the Grand Ole Opry and helped turn Nashville into a country music mecca. Thanks to the tireless advocacy work of musicians Rhiannon Giddens and Dom Flemons, we know about the banjo’s African roots and its prominence in early Black folk music. Plus, musicians such as Charley Pride and Darius Rucker broke numerous barriers as two of the first African American country music superstars.\n\nBut what isn’t as often acknowledged is how Black singers, across all genres, have historically dabbled in country. Beyoncé is by no means the first. Ray Charles, Solomon Burke, Bobby Womack, Esther Philips, Otis Williams, Millie Jackson, and Tina Turner (to name a few) have recorded country albums. More recently, rap and R & B artists Ludacris, LL Cool J, Nelly, and Snoop Dogg have each collaborated with country music superstars. Even so, the misconception of Black people being innately averse to country music has stubbornly persisted throughout the years.\n\n(A mecca for rap has emerged in the birthplace of jazz and blues.)\n\n“As a country music fan, I did not feel safe in country music spaces,” says Black Opry founder Holly G. “It is not confusing to me that Black people have been hesitant to come into this space.”\n\nThe country music industry and White country fans alike have done little to welcome non-White artists—either by gatekeeping who is allowed to appear on country charts, refusing to play certain artists on country radio, or displaying Confederate flags at prestigious country music festivals (a practice that was only recently banned).\n\nThe new faces in country\n\nFounded in April 2021, Black Opry began as a website highlighting Black country, folk, and Americana artists. In January 2022, Holly and Tanner Davenport cofounded the Black Opry Revue, an artist collective that performs around the U.S.\n\n“I’m hoping that now, their eyes will be opened to the fact that there is a way to consume it safely and with people who look like you,” says Holly.\n\nHolly remembers how, in the months before starting Black Opry, she would search online for ‘Black country artists,’ and the same few names would appear. Even today, most media attention continues to fall on a handful of megastars—Kane Brown, Mickey Guyton, and Darius Rucker—but today’s field of Black country music is manifold.\n\n(Discover the history of Tennessee’s forgotten music empire.)\n\nWhile emerging artists like Dalton Dover, Michael Warren, Chauncey Jones, Rodell Duff, and Aaron Vance skew toward a more traditional and acoustic country sound, other singers such as Breland, Willie Jones, RVSHVD, and Tanner Adell are melding trap and R & B elements with country—a musical alchemy that can be heard on Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em.”\n\nTwenty-six-year-old singer and songwriter Reyna Roberts—who borrows equally from country, rock, and pop—attributes her distinctive sound to the broad scope of music she’d been exposed to as a child. “I grew up listening to country, trap, hip hop, classical music, pop, everything,” she says. “But, as a songwriter, I realized that a lot of the songs I was writing were country songs.”\n\nRoberts says she’s seen a dramatic increase in listeners and social media followers following Beyoncé’s Super Bowl announcement, gaining close to 400,000 new followers.\n\nOther Black female country and roots artists, like Adell, who released the trap-country “Buckle Bunny” in the summer of 2023, and Linda Martell, the first black female solo artist to play the Grand Ole Opry, have also seen sharp increases in streams and downloads in recent weeks.\n\n(Here’s how the Harlem Renaissance helped forge a new sense of Black identity.)\n\nBlack Opry’s Holly G is guardedly optimistic that the current excitement surrounding Beyoncé’s foray into country will continue to inspire listeners and critics to learn about the many other talented, wide-ranging, and innovative Black country artists who have been here all along.\n\n“There’s so much diversity even within Black country music,” she says, “and that’s what I hope people are eventually able to see and take away from this.”"
