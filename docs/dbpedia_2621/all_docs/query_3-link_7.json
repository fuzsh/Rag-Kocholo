        "text": "Thereâs a whole world of music out there (the medal for the most obvious statement goes to us). Itâs estimated that there are anywhere between 97 and 230 million songs in the world.\n\nUs humans like order. We like to put things into boxes so they make sense to us. And we like to use these boxes to help us form an identity ourselves. Thatâs why music genres are so important.Â\n\nWe already have a wrap up on what genre is, and a deep dive into pop, rock and hip-hop, so now itâs time to look at the world of country music.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat is country music?\n\nWhen people talk about âcountry musicâ they usually mean American country music (sometimes also referred to as Country & Western).\n\nCountry music is a genre of popular music that originated in the Southern United States in the early 20th century. It takes its roots from various folk traditions, and combines elements of folk, blues, Western, and gospel music.\n\nCountry music is often seen as a style and genre of largely string-accompanied American popular music, usually vocalised, generally simple in form and harmony. The songs in the genre are generally romantic or melancholy ballads, accompanied by acoustic or electric guitar, banjo, violin and harmonicas.\n\nItâs a vast musical genre taking in everything from Bluegrass (which originated in the Blue Mountains of Virginia), Honky Tonk (featuring fiddles and steel guitars), Hillbilly and Outlaw, to more modern genres such as Alt-country.\n\nThe sound\n\nThere are a few ways to identify a country song:\n\nInstrumentation: Country music typically features instruments such as guitars (acoustic, electric, and steel), banjos, fiddles, harmonicas, and mandolins.\n\nLyrics: The lyrics often tell stories and focus on themes such as love, heartbreak, family, hard work, and rural life. They tend to be straightforward and relatable.\n\nVocal Style: The vocal delivery in country music is often characterised by a twang or drawl, which reflects its Southern origins.\n\nBut as country music developed throughout the 20th Century, all kinds of instruments began to be used, including drums, electric guitars, zithers and mandolins.Â\n\nLike all genres, subgenres of country music have developed over time:\n\nBluegrass: Focuses on acoustic string instruments and harmonies, exemplified by artists like Bill Monroe.\n\nOutlaw Country: A reaction against the polished Nashville sound, with a raw, rebellious edge, popularised by Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings.\n\nCountry Pop: A blend of country and pop music, often featuring a more polished production style, associated with artists like Shania Twain and Taylor Swift.\n\nâ\n\nThe historyÂ\n\nCountry musicâs earliest roots are in the 17th Century, when predominantly British and Irish immigrants brought their instruments, songs and musical traditions to the USA. Many settled in the Appalachian region (an area that runs from southern New York to northern Mississippi in the eastern US).\n\nThe genre really took off with the arrival of radio in the 1920s. Early radio shows like Grand Ole Opry, which began in 1924 and was based in Nashville, Tennessee before later being broadcast nationwide, gave country music exposure - allowing people to listen to, and become fans of bands that werenât from their local area.\n\nThen during the Great Depression, rural people were increasingly forced into big cities in search of work, taking their favourite music with them and exposing it to new audiences.\n\nEarly Influences: Early country music was influenced by the folk music of European immigrants and the blues from African American communities.\n\n1920s-1930s: The genre began to gain popularity with artists like Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, who are considered pioneers.\n\n1940s-1950s: This period saw the rise of honky-tonk and Western swing, with artists such as Hank Williams and Bob Wills.\n\n1960s-1970s: Country music began to merge with pop music, leading to the development of the \"Nashville Sound\" with artists like Patsy Cline and Jim Reeves.\n\n1980s-Present: The genre continued to evolve, incorporating rock and pop influences, leading to the success of artists like Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, and more recently, artists like Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan.\n\nThe Country Music Association reported that streaming of country stars rose by almost 50% between 2020 and 2022 and its popularity on these shores is still growing.Â\n\nâ\n\nIdentifiable country artistsÂ\n\nAccording to YouGov, the top 5 most popular country artists in the UK are:\n\nDolly Parton\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nShania Twain\n\nBonnie Tyler\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nReal life application\n\nCountry music has a characteristic authenticity which makes it particularly suited to those venues looking to set a familiar tone. The instrumentation found in classic country tracks gives this kind of music a very human feel which helps to reinforce approachable atmospheres - perfect for cosy pubs (when used in moderation). On the other hand, with Country music exploding in recent years due to artists like TS, Morgan Wallen, and Luke Combs, we are seeing adjacent genres pop up all over the place - artists taking country influences and packaging them through different musical lenses. These fusion genres are more suited to those venues looking to set a younger and more modern tone, whilst still maintaining a feeling of realness.\n\nMagnus, our Music Consultant (and genius)\n\nâ"
