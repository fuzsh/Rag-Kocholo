        "text": "I am not a country music fan, so maybe I am a bit biased. I was ready to whip out a banjo, put on some cowboy boots and start learning how to do the two-step. “Girls’ Night Out,” an album with a compilation of female country artists arranged for a Country Music Television special, showed me that country music has come a long way from the bluegrass tunes that it is more commonly associated with.The CD features songs by Sara Evans, Mindy McCready, Martina McBride and Lorrie Morgan. Any female country fan would most likely enjoy the CD’s variety. From the Patsy Cline era to modernized country music, each artist brings a different flavor to the CD.The CD showcases the talents of female country artists who are sometimes overlooked by non-country fans with songs from their previous CD’s. The CD’s themes seem to be the strength of the modern woman and the rise of popularity among female country singers. Sara Evans opens up the CD with her tune “Cryin’ Game.” Evans has two albums and is currently working on a new project which has spun “Cryin’ Game.” Despite being somewhat of a newcomer on the Nashville circuit, Evans’ songs are a lot like songs from names that made country famous again, such as Reba and the Judds. It is upbeat and Evans’ strong, deep voice make it a solid song.The next song, “Almost New,” was written for the movie “Clay Pigeons.” The slow song sounds like an old Patsy Cline hit. Her last effort on the CD is “Three Chords and the Truth.” It is similar to “Cryin’ Game” in terms of melody and the era of country music that she sings.Next up is Martina McBride with her three hits, all previously released. “Independence Day,” a song about an abusive husband and the wife protecting her child. The wife burns down the house with herself and her husband in it while the child is enjoying fireworks. It is a very strong song, feeling McBride’s effort and her usage of historical song references such as “by dawn’s early light” and “let freedom ring” looks at Independence Day in a whole new way.McBride’s other two songs are “‘Til I Can Make it on my Own,” a tribute to Tammy Wynette, and “Happy Girl.” “‘Til I Can Make it on my Own” sounds less like a country song and more like a slow song heard on a popular music station. “Happy Girl,” an upbeat song that is an epitome of modern country got me dancing and singing along with its strong harmonica chords. Following is Mindy McCready’s distinct country twang. But her songs on “Girls’ Night Out” do not have much of a country melody. The CD includes “Ten Thousand Angels,” her debut song. All of her songs sound like they have potential to crossover into popular music stations like Shania Twain and Leann Rimes. “Over and Over” sounds like a country-rock song, almost like a female group from the 1980s. “Long, Long Time,” a remake of a Linda Ronstadt song, is similar to “Ten Thousand Angels” but much slower.Last on the CD is Lorrie Morgan, a singer of a more traditional form of country. Not quite as extreme as banjos and big belt buckles, the songs are more for the baby boomers and country music fans who have been around before the “new country” trend.”The Heart That Jack Broke” is the first track by Morgan. The name alone is a dead give away that it’s a country tune. It sounds like a typical country song about the beer-drinkin’, heart-breakin’ man. Although her next song, “Go Away,” has such a stronger twang and guitar music that it almost got me doing the “tush push,” a country line dance for those country-illiterate folks out there. The lyrics “I’m a wishy washy girl but it’s a wishy washy world” in the strongest southern twang makes her fit right in at Nashville.After listening to the CD several times, I found myself singing the songs. I hate to admit it, but I kind of enjoyed “Girls’ Night Out.” I realized that country music isn’t all about banjos and a knee-slappin’, clap happy good time. It sure beats a lot of other music out there. You can sing and dance along. By the way, when is the last time you turned on a country radio station?"
