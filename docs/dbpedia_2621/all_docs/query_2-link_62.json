        "text": "So who are some of the richest country music stars in 2023, according to Celebrity Net Worth? We take a look …\n\n7-8. Tim McGraw, 56, and Faith Hill, 56: US$200 million\n\nComing in at No 7 and 8 with a combined net worth of US$200 million is country music power couple Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, per Celebrity Net Worth. After meeting in 1996 when McGraw opened for Hill on her Spontaneous Combustion Tour, they fell in love, she became pregnant, and they got hitched that same year.\n\nSince then, the pair has remained one of country’s most powerful duos, even embarking on a co-headlining tour called the Soul2Soul II Tour between 2006-2007. It grossed over US$140 million, per Billboard, becoming one of the highest-earning country tours of all time.\n\n6. George Strait, 71: US$300 million\n\nWidely known as the “King of Country”, George Strait is one of the most popular recording artists of all time, having sold over 100 million records. In 2012, Strait announced his retirement and a final tour, The Cowboy Rides Away Tour. The last show in Arlington, Texas was attended by 104,790 people – the largest ever single-show attendance in US history at the time, according to his website. Fortunately for fans, he started performing again in recent years and has since announced his official return to the stage with a 2024 stadium tour.\n\n5. Toby Keith, 62: US$370 million to US$400 million\n\nToby Keith arrived in Nashville during the early 1990s where he busked on the city’s famous Music Row. Little did he know he would eventually become one of country music’s most successful and wealthiest stars.\n\nNot only does Keith earn millions as a country singer, songwriter, actor and music producer, he’s also an entrepreneur who’s invested in various businesses, from a record label and golf course to restaurant chains.\n\n4. Shania Twain, 58: US$400 million\n\nShe’s often labelled the “Queen of Country Pop” and her 1997 album Come On Over holds the record for both the bestselling studio album of all time by a female artist and the bestselling country album of all time, selling more than 40 million copies since its release, per the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nTwain is a savvy businesswoman too, partnering with brands like Coty, Proctor & Gamble, Revlon and Diet Coke over the years. Following her battle with Lyme disease that saw her retreat from the public eye, she’s increased her net worth in recent years by going back on tour. Her last Las Vegas residency was earning her a reported US$1 million per show, with more shows scheduled in 2024.\n\n2-3. Garth Brooks, 61, and Trisha Yearwood, 59: US$350 million to US$400 million\n\nAnother popular couple in country music, Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood have amassed an immense combined net worth over the years. So much so that Brooks publicly retired back in 2000. However, due to popular demand, he came out of retirement in 2014 and has been raking in millions with new music and sell-out tours since then. In fact, his Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace is currently in full swing and has been extended to December 2024.\n\nAnd while Brooks brings in most the couple’s fortune, his wife Yearwood is also a country icon who earns big money as a recording artist, author and TV host.\n\n1. Dolly Parton, 77: US$650 million\n\nIn 2021, Dollywood, her legendary theme park, was estimated to be making US$3 million in revenue a year and, according to Fox Business, is worth an estimated US$165 million. Other lucrative business endeavours include Splash Country water park, DreamMore Resort and Spa, and eight restaurants surrounding the Dollywood theme park."
