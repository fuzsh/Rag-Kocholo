        "text": "As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing\n\nThe tune about the wild side of life\n\nAs I listen to the words you are saying\n\nIt brings memories when I was a trusting wife\n\nIt wasn′t God who made Honky Tonk angels\n\nAs you said in the words of your song\n\nToo many times married men think they're still single\n\nThat has caused many a good girl to go wrong\n\nIt′s a shame that all the blame is on us women\n\nIt's not true that only you men feel the same\n\nFrom the start most every heart that's ever broken\n\nWas because there always was a man to blame\n\nIt wasn′t God who made Honky Tonk angels\n\nAs you said in the words of your song\n\nToo many times married men think they′re still single\n\nThat has caused many a good girl to go wrong\n\nWriter(s): J.d. Miller<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
