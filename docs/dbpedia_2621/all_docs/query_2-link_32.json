        "text": "outlaw music, movement of American country music in the 1970s spearheaded by Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings (b. June 15, 1937, Littlefield, Texas, U.S.—d. February 13, 2002, Chandler, Arizona). Sometimes called progressive country, outlaw music was an attempt to escape the formulaic constraints of the Nashville Sound (simple songs, the use of studio musicians, and lush production), country’s dominant style in the 1960s. An outgrowth of the honky-tonk style pioneered by Hank Williams, it mixed folk’s introspective lyrics, rock’s rhythms, and country’s instrumentation. Like Southern rock and the country rock that developed in Los Angeles, outlaw music was a rock and roots music hybrid that had a local flavour.\n\nIn 1971 Nelson left Nashville, Tennessee, and returned to his native Texas. Cultivating a long-haired image that violated country’s social conservatism, he restarted his career in Austin, where hippies and rednecks mingled in clubs such as the Armadillo World Headquarters. The movement spawned by this scene took its name from Ladies Love Outlaws (1972), an album by Jennings (a onetime disc jockey who had played bass in Buddy Holly’s band before eventually going to Nashville in the mid-1960s to write and record). Nelson’s Wild West concept album, Red Headed Stranger (1975), had production so spare that Columbia fought against its release. Yet that album, featuring “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,” captivated a large crossover audience with its Western storytelling and lean artiness, as did Wanted: The Outlaws (1976), recorded by Jennings; his wife, Jessi Colter; Nelson; and Tompall Glaser. The movement risked falling into its own formula as other outlaws appeared, but Jennings remained an eclectic, if inconsistent, performer, while Nelson branched out in other musical directions."
