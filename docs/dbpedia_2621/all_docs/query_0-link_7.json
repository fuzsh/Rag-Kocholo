We're on the side of angels, If we believe this love is pure. Is it so hard to trust it, 'Cause we've been wrong before? There comes a time in every life, We find the heart we're waiting for. After all the might-have-beens, The close and distant calls After all the try-agains, Don't be afraid to fall We're on the side of angels after all. Every time you touch me, Don't you feel it too? The gentle hand that's guiding us You to me, me to you After all the might-have-beens, The close and distant calls After all the try-agains, Don't be afraid to fall We're on the side of angels after all. Heaven only knows Why this took so long But only Heaven knows A love is right or wrong After all the might-have-beens, The close and distant calls After all the try-agains, Don't be afraid to fall We're on the side of angels, On the side of angels We're on the side of angels After all, Oh, yeah On the side of Angels Oh\n\nBecome A Better Singer In Only 30 Days, With Easy Video Lessons!\n\n4 fans\n\nSheet Music PDF Playlist\n\nWritten by: GERRY HOUSE, GARY S.
