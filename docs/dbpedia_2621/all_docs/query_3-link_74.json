        "text": "When you think of musical instruments you likely imagine a guitar or piano, but those are just the basics. In fact, the world is full of unusual musical instruments that have been crafted and perfected over centuries and are instantly recognisable in their respective regions. However, within mainstream music, it is rare that these instruments ever get the attention they deserve, and many of them look like alterations of flutes or combinations of other instruments found in the western world.\n\nSo with that in mind, we take a look at the lesser-known instruments from around the world. We aim to show you the finest selection of instruments and explain just what they offer. Below you will be able to discover the most unusual music instruments that are found throughout different cultures and whilst all of our products are unique, these ones that I have selected are by far the most different.\n\n1. Gobijeu\n\nAn extremely unique stringed musical instrument from India. This one is similar to the guitar but features only 1 string that can be adjusted whilst playing to create something out of this world. As the pitch can be adjusted by the wooden dowel, this allows for some intense creativity. Whilst plucking the string you can create some natural phasing sounds that is amplified by the bottom chamber to create resonance. We have assorted gobijeus in a variety of colours, each one is finished in a hand painted dot design.\n\nThis multicoloured Indian instrument is fantastic for sound designers that work in TV and film, but also for music producers who are looking for something unusual for their next hit single. Stand away from the competition and do something different! Not just for professionals, these are a great instrument for general fun. Kids and beginner instrumentalists will love experimenting with it and will enjoy exploring its capabilities. A gobijeu is made from thick bamboo, wood, rope and recycled plastic.\n\n2. Erhu\n\nThe Erhu is a type of violin but looks very different from a conventional model. It features a drum resonator on the bottom of the instrument, usually made from a snakeskin membrane, and it can be played as a solo instrument or used as part of a small or large orchestra.\n\n3. Tarka flute\n\nThe hand carved Peruvian Tarka flute is an unusual woodwind instrument that is made by the tribes people of Peru. Each flute is colourful and has a different carving. The flute is easy to play but difficult to play well. The word ‘Tarka’ is of Hungarian origin and translates in English to ‘accurate’.\n\nThis is a word used to describe the traditional way of making the instrument. It is one of the weirdest block flutes. In fact, it is more of a recorder, although it is much shorter than the regular type which means that it will require more breath to play. The sound is darker and more penetrative, this is one of the smallest Tarka flutes but they do come in many sizes.\n\n4. Shime daiko\n\nThe Shine Daiko is a small drum with broad drum heads. This drum is played with Bachi. The drum heads are taught thanks to the construction process where they are stretched over iron hoops, then the body, then bound to each other. As a result, this produces a much more high pitched sound to the traditional Taiko.\n\n5. Indian Bulb Horn\n\nThis retro Indian brass bulb horn is somewhat a classic, it has a vintage look and when squeezed sounds like one of those horns that come from a clowns car, or nose. It may feature a unique look in your music video or perhaps the sound will take you to the circus. It would suit a festival scene or school music class. The horn from India features a rubber handle and solid metal frame.\n\nThe classic horn is cheap to buy and is a replica of an old classic. Making a loud noise with these is simple, just squeeze the balloon shaped rubber handle. You could use this instrument as a sound effect in your music. The source of where you get your honky horn is very important, as there is a cheaper copy of this item online that is defective. With customers complaining that it doesn’t make a noise. Our honky horn is the best and we always test it before sending it out.\n\n6. Dizi\n\nThe Dizi is a traditional Chinese flute that has been played in the Chinese orchestra for centuries. This flute is often carved from white or coloured bamboo and has a tissue-thin membrane made from reed. This instrument has been around in Chinese culture for over 9,000 years and remains a popular, lightweight instrument for the Chinese population to learn to this day.\n\n7. Ruan\n\nThe Ruan is a type of lute with a fretted neck, a circular body and four strings. This instrument was initially made with 13 frets and silk strings, but the modern Ruan is made with steel strings and 24 frets with 12 semitones per string. The traditional Ruan has an ivory fretboard, but this has been swapped for steel in more modern models.\n\n8. Rindik Bunga Xylophone\n\nYou're probably thinking I have heard of an xylophone, what is special about this one? Well, this one features stunning hand-painted flowers on top, and underneath it has resonance chambers made from naturally carved gourds. The word Rindik is a Balinese word that literally means tool, Bunga means strong connection but can also be relevant to the Bunga deity that was worshipped throughout Asia.\n\nThis is a rare to find unusual musical instrument that would make a great gift for the passionate music person. To play the Rindik Xylophone use the beaters provided and simply struck each note to a melody. Alternatively you can struck multiple notes at a time to play a chord as you would with any other instrument. We sell these at a great price. The Rindik Bunga is suited to many styles, and can even be used for orchestra style music.\n\n9. Ocarina Pendant\n\nThese cute little woodwind instruments are handmade from clay and comes in hand painted designs. This one is small in size and is best suited for children over the age of three. In fact, the ocarina started off as a toy in Italy but was transformed by Giuseppe Donati from Budrio, into a musical instrument.\n\nThe original ocarina had a somewhat submarine style shape but this one is more rounded and the thing that makes this one look unusual is its Peruvian inspired design. This specific instrument is suitable for a beginner. Kids love it because it can be worn as a necklace and be blown as a whistle. There are many guides and resources online as well as videos of the instrument being played to give you a rough idea of what to expect.\n\n10. Koto\n\nThe Koto is a half tube zephyr instrument and is regarded as the national instrument of Japan. These instruments usually have 13 strings and several moving bridges. However, they can have 17 strings in some cases. These instruments are typically made from Paulownia wood, and musicians will tend to pluck three strings to make melodies.\n\n11. Shamisen\n\nThe Shamisen is a three-string instrument that is often used to support the kabuki. It has a small soundbox, a long, thin neck with no frets and traditional models would use dog and cat skin for the resonating body. However, more modern instruments tend to be made from plastic. These instruments are often used during puppet shows.\n\n12. Cha Cha Bracelet\n\nThe cha cha shaker is a natural bracelet that is worn on the wrist or the ankle. It is made of nuts and colourful beads in Peru. They are great for parties, festivals and any occasion that is suited to making noise effortlessly. The sound is made by the nuts clanging together and sounds like pebbles clashing together in the sea water. Elasticated and will fit most wrist sizes.\n\n13. Sonajas Shaker\n\nThe sonajas shaker is made from straw and metal. The Peruvian shaker comes in many colours and is slightly weird looking. Its design features a big closed hoop for a handle, which is perfect for a child over the age of three to grip onto and give a shake. In Spanish sonajas and sonajero translates to rattle.\n\n14. Veena\n\nThis is a chordophone instrument that is helped for the lute and the arched harp. It has a large, hollow body, four melodic strings and three auxiliary strings and is played with a mixture of plucking and strumming motions. It can produce sounds on a three-octave range and is usually made from gourd or jackwood. However, more modern models are made from fibreglass.\n\n15. Sarangi\n\nA sarangi is a short, bow and stringed instrument which has the innate ability to mimic the human voice, producing truly unique melodic sounds. This instrument is carved from a block of red cedar wood and has three hollowed-out resonance chambers, each producing various sounds that get progressively deeper.\n\n16. Damaru\n\nThis Twist drum from India is similar to a monkey drum in the way that you play it, only it can be done in one hand instead of two. Featuring striped assorted colours. The damaru is one of the smallest Indian drums. The next size up would be a dholak, then a dhol and finally a fancy drum.\n\n17. Hichiriki\n\nThis double reeded Japanese flute is revered as a sacred instrument and usually features in Shinto wedding ceremonies. It is crafted like an oboe but sounds more like a clarinet due to the cylindrical bore and bamboo. The sound of this instrument is regularly described as 'haunting'.\n\n18. Tonkori\n\nThe Tonkori is a plucked string instrument that is constructed in the shape of a sword. It has a long neck with no frets, five strings, is made from Jezo spruce wood, strings made from deer tendon and during construction, a pebble is placed within the body cavity of the instrument, granting it a soul.\n\n19. Thunder drum\n\nHear the thunder roar. This is not your usual drum. The thunder drum is not played the same way as other drums. It consists of a tubular shape made from hardened cardboard with a metal spring in the centre. The bottom features recycled PVC which amplifies the sound when knocked.\n\nTo play this instrument simply hold it up and allow the spring to move around creating the fascinating sound effects of thunder. Looking at the instrument it is difficult to comprehend the sound. This is a must have instrument for any sound designer and uses a similar concept to the spring sound that brought you Star Wars.\n\n20. Pipa\n\nA Pipa is a stringed instrument modelled after the lute and is often called the 'Chinese Lute'. This instrument can be crafted in many ways and can have anywhere from 12 to 31 frets. This instrument is played by plucking the various strings and was played in modern music by bands like Bjork and Incubus.\n\n21. Guqin\n\nThe Gujin, or 'the instrument of the sages', is a long, seven-string, plucked instrument played in ancient Chinese culture. This instrument is without frets but has a movable bridge underneath each string. This instrument was showcased at the Beijing Olympic opening ceremony, and a version of this instrument called a Song Period was sold for $22 million in 2010.\n\n22. Sanxian\n\nThe Sanxian is another lute style instrument with a substantial, fretless neck, three strings and a small body commonly made from snakeskin. This instrument can be strummed or plucked and has a sound that is not too dissimilar to a Banjo.\n\n23.
