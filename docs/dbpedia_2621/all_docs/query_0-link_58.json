        "text": "LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:\n\nCountry music singer Mindy McCready was found dead on the porch of her Arkansas home yesterday. Police said she died from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nMindy McCready released her first album in 1996 and it went multiplatinum. The title track, \"Ten Thousand Angels,\" was one of her biggest hits.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TEN THOUSAND ANGELS\")\n\nMINDY MCCREADY: (Singing) I need 10,000 angels watching over me tonight...\n\nWERTHEIMER: In recent years, the 37-year-old was better known for her personal problems than her music. She struggled with drug addiction and child-custody issues. The father of one of her children died last month. That death is still being investigated.\n\nMindy McCready leaves behind two young sons.\n\nCopyright © 2013 NPR. All rights reserved.
