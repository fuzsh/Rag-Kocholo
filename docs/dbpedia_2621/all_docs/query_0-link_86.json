        "text": "There is a group of guardian angels looking out for the kids and young adults of Baton Rouge, and they’ve been handed the keys to a big old red brick church on Government Street. Their goal of converting this old church into a multi-faceted youth center isn’t exactly conventional, but neither is the community they intend to benefit with their creative—and ambitious—plans for it.\n\nThe project is the fruit of a collaboration between four nonprofits: Front Yard Bikes, the Big Buddy Program, Humanities Amped, and Line4Line; appropriately, they call themselves the “Angel Coalition”. Though each organization brings something uniquely important to the new youth center, the overarching goal is unified: “If we invest in our community’s greatest asset—our youth—we will see huge social and economic returns on our investment.” And the planned investment is not a small one. The Angel Coalition still needs $550K to pay off the note on the former church and to complete building renovations. “So that challenge lies ahead,” explained Anna West, Executive Director of Humanities Amped. “We’re hoping that some true believers will step in with the donors who have gotten us this far up the path and help us get the job finished.”\n\nThe coalition is not only asking for donations, but for ideas and help from the community. Skilled workers, input, and even a name for the upcoming center are all still needed.\n\n“We each respect the work already being done by each partner, and immediately recognized how this project would be bigger and more impactful than we could ever be as individual agencies,” said Gaylynne Mack, Executive Director of Big Buddy in Baton Rouge.\n\nThough each organization brings something uniquely important to the new youth center, the overarching goal is unified: “If we invest in our community’s greatest asset—our youth—we will see huge social and economic returns on our investment.”\n\nThe mission is for the building to be filled out with contributions from the four organizations, each providing an outlet for personal, as well as professional, development. The Front Yard Bikes Mid City Bike Shop, a community-owned shop providing sales, repairs, and classes, will offer youth professional development courses and certification classes, while employing young people. Big Buddy will contribute skill development workshops, further workforce experiences, and support for young folks as they obtain industry-recognized certifications that have the potential to lead to well-paid employment. Humanities Amped plans to include an after-school studio with peer-supported tutoring and healing circles, spoken word poetry open mics, civic engagement projects and conferences, and a wide array of training for educators, youth, and peer leaders. Line4Line will complete the center with a Barber & Beauty Shop, a full-service salon offering not only haircuts, but hands-on training and employment opportunities. A community reading room will also provide access to books and literary support, along with creative after school programs focused on teaching marketable technical art and craft skills.\n\n“Our vision is to ensure that Baton Rouge youth have access to a vibrant and inviting space,” Mack expressed, “And a network of opportunities through which youth can experience joy, purpose, belonging, and the chance to imagine and contribute to a better world.”\n\nIf you’d like to contribute in the form of donations, work, ideas, or name suggestions, visit any of the four organizations’ Facebook pages. You can donate through Cash App ($AngelsCoalition), any of the organizations’ websites, or through the 225 Gives Campaign, which can result in your donation being doubled or even tripled.\n\nfrontyardbikes.com\n\nbigbuddyprogram.org\n\nhumanitiesamped.com"
