        "text": "Jazz was born in New Orleans about 100 years ago (early 20th century), but its roots can be found in the musical traditions of both Africa and Europe; in fact, some people say that jazz is a union of African and European music.\n\nNew Orleans was the perfect city for all of these elements to come together, as it was a port city (with people arriving from all parts of the world), a meeting place for people of different ethnic groups, and a city with a nightlife in which musicians had the opportunity to play together, learn from each other, and blend all of these elements.\n\nThe most important jazz originator and first truly great jazz soloist (improviser) was trumpet player Louis Armstrong. Listen to “Dippermouth Blues” on The Instrumental History of Jazz2 or \"Working Man's Blues\" by clicking below:\n\nJazz is always incorporating what came before with what’s coming next; some like to say that the best jazz musicians have one foot in the past and the other in the future (see the accompanying booklet to The Instrumental History of Jazz for the names and brief descriptions of the main styles of jazz that have evolved to date).\n\nToday, jazz is played and listened to by people of all ages, cultures, and ethnicities and includes musical elements and styles from all over the world; jazz has gone from being America’s music to being the world’s music."
