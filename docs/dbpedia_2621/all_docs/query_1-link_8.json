        "text": "Twenty years ago this week, the soundtrack to the Meg Ryan/Nicholas Cage romantic tragedy City of Angels was released and my crying in my room game really leveled up. To be clear, my crying in my room game was pretty 100 at this point. I was a teenager and I had every feeling. I repeatedly submitted myself to the TED Organization but they seemed uninterested in my talk entitled \"All the Feelings: I have had them and they are a lot.\"\n\nWhile I waited for a response from TED or Ken Burns or someone, I spent a lot of time sitting up in my room like Brandy, listening to music on a Discman. 1998 in particular was an excellent year for music, cry-inducing and otherwise. Madonna's Ray of Light, OutKast's Aquemini, DMX's It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, Fatboy Slim's You've Come A Long Way Baby and Alanis Morissette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie all dropped that year. My ears were shewk. And in August, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was released, blessing the world with possibly the best collection of music ever created. It was a great year for listening to music through foam headphones connected to a device that played small silver circles.\n\nAll of those albums fit a certain mood and phase of teenage development for which I am eternally grateful. But when I was feeling my most Angela Chase, the only music for me was the soundtrack to a movie in which Nicholas Cage plays an angel who wears a trench coat and sort of stalks Meg Ryan because he has too many feelings.\n\nYou may be thinking, \"Wait, don't you mean John Travolta played a trench coat-wearing angel?\" But no, he was in the other movie about an angel who wears a trench coat and falls in love with a human woman and romcom queen. You're thinking of Michael, co-starring Andie McDowell. Also, very excellent soundtrack, but hard to cry to.\n\nIn City of Angels, Nicholas Cage plays a morose celestial being whose days consist of taking people from life to death and hanging out with other angels on the beach like the cast of an MTV reality TV show.\n\nOne day at work, Nicholas Cage the Angel (that was his character's name, I think) meets a determined surgeon who seems to be able to see him even though angels are invisible. She is played by Meg Ryan, who at this time is also at her most angelic. Seeing Meg Ryan in an operating room being a boss but also very relatable, one wonders why she hasn't been given a multi-episode arc with spinoff possibilities on Grey's Anatomy yet. She's magnetic. Nicholas Cage thinks so, too. And so he follows her around for a bit and then makes himself visible to her. He falls in love and decides that he wants to become human so he can be with her. But as an angel of death he knows that as a human he would ::dramatic pause:: die.\n\nAre you already feeling so many feelings?! This movie takes place in San Francisco, so Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage spend many maudlin days wandering through the fog, alternating between being existentially sad and banging each other. And both of these things are blanketed with some of the most evocative songs ever pressed into a metallic coaster or cassette player and sold at a Sam Goody.\n\nIn retrospect, the soundtrack to City of Angels actually served a number of important, non-crying purposes. Obviously, it scored the lush film, smoothing over all the edges of implausibility. But it also served as a promotional tool for Alanis Morissette's second album, following Jagged Little Pill, and the Goo Goo Doll's sixth album, Dizzy Up the Girl. Morissette's \"Uninvited\" and the Goo Goo Doll's \"Iris\" were both written for the soundtrack, and they were instantly huge hits as singles, igniting massive interest in the soundtrack and in the artists' forthcoming releases. It was a win-win for sales and strong emotions everywhere. These two songs, along with the third single from City of Angels, Sarah McLachlan's \"Angel,\" provide a perfect snapshot of late '90s musical chest-beating. McLachlan's ballad is characteristically vulnerable, dripping with pathos and mourning. It's, of course, probably best known nowadays as the soundtrack to the saddest animal cruelty commercials ever created. To get a sense of how dramatically affecting the song was when it came out, take the way you feel when you see sad dogs, add the dulcet sounds of Delilah and imagine you're the titular character in Lady Bird.\n\nIt's intense.\n\nEqually intense but on the opposite side of the Lilith Fair spectrum is Alanis' \"Uninvited,\" a haunting, yawp of a song that drips recrimination and messy relationship drama in every note. While \"Angel\" is a great song for general sadness, \"Uninvited\" is the perfect song for when you're sad but also mad at your friends for going to Claire's to get their ears pierced without you.\n\nAnd then there's the anthem \"Iris,\" long a staple of \"Hits of the 80s, 90s, and today\" radioland. A moody guitar-heavy alternative classic, \"Iris\" is the Jordan Catalano of songs. It's cool but also incredibly emo. This is a song that repeatedly yells at you to not look at it while it stalks around dramatically. \"Iris\" is perfect for that thing where you're sad because you're so in love and no one has ever felt like this.\n\nCombined, the three singles cover just about every phase of high school crying I could muster. And when they didn't do the trick, Peter Gabriel's mournful ode to death, aptly titled \"I Grieve,\" came galloping to the rescue. While not written specifically for the soundtrack, its inclusion feels seamless, both musically and tonally. Sliding from \"Iris\" to \"I Grieve\" the album seems to dare you to not feel something. Or everything.\n\nCity of Angels isn't just a comfortable home for sob songs, however. Listening to it again, I was pleasantly shocked at the forthright sexuality of Paula Cole's \"Feelin' Love.\" Paula is here to remind you that when you're a maudlin angel who becomes human for love, you get to do a lot of sex stuff and it's pretty great. Combined with Jimi Hendrix' classic \"Red House\", \"Feelin' Love\" gives the album a saucy undercurrent that I definitely was not mature enough to get back in the day.\n\nThe album is bookended by U2's \"If God Will Send His Angels\" and Eric Clapton's blues \"Further On Up the Road,\" both great recordings put to good use here. They're great rocking intro and outros to this swirling world of emotion but they're not the ones doing the heavy-lifting. Good to jam to, hard to cry at.\n\nEven if you're not interested in staring plaintively out of your teenage bedroom window while having a lot of stuff going on inside, it's hard not to be impressed by the soundtrack to City of Angels. The '90s were a golden age of movie soundtracks—The Bodyguard, Waiting to Exhale, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Philadelphia all boasted serious track listings and produced decade-defining hits. Even Space Jam has some bangers. All of them have their rightful place in the pantheon of great albums, but City of Angels pulled off the remarkable feat of being a perfect snapshot of late-90s angst while also remaining imminently listenable two decades later. It's a classic, plain and simple. Now, if you'll excuse me, my Discman is skipping and it's really got me in my feelings."
