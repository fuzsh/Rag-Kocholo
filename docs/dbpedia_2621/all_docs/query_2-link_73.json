        "text": "In this second installment of Hallowed Sound, journalists from the USA TODAY Network examine the state of race in country music, scour the South in search of untold stories and shine a light on a new, eclectic generation of Black artists.\n\nMy mom had a whole bunch of records, and one of those big Hi-Fis. When I got to 6 or 7, I would put records on. I remember finding a Charley Pride record. I asked my mom, \"Is this that country guy that we saw on 'Hee Haw?'\" It was a great thing for me. I was just a little kid and I was getting flak from my family for the music I listened to. Here was somebody that looked like me singing country music – that wasn't supposed to be.\n\nWe took elements of all those different musical genres and made it country. The banjo originated in Africa. It came over with slaves, and now it's one of the biggest instruments in country music. Hank Williams Sr. listened to all of those blues players. I think African Americans have had a profound effect on country music.\n\nWhen I came to Nashville 14 years ago, I was going into the radio stations and being told that they didn't think it was going to work because I was African American. That was tough. But I was glad to get the truth, and it was what it was. When I had three number ones in a row on my first record, I think that made people go, \"Well, maybe we were wrong.\"\n\nAnd it was great for me, but I felt even better when I saw Kane Brown getting a deal, and Jimmie Allen getting a deal, and Mickey Guyton coming out and doing her thing.\n\nWhen you have people that talented, it's important to get them represented. And the more that happens, the bigger our audience is going to get, because there's going to be more people of color looking at country music in a different way and saying, \"You know, I do like that.\" And I guarantee you, if you give it a shot, you'll find something you like.\n\nThe one thing I’ve found, in the places I've been and with the things I've tried to do – which were always unconventional – is that you can change people's hearts. You can change people's minds. You can change the way people see the world, if they love you, and if they're friends with you.\n\nCountry music has this stigma of rebel flags and racism, and that's changing. I think it's changing drastically. And I'm just glad. I hope I'm remembered as one of the people that tried to fight that, and one of the reasons that changed.\n\nHallowed Sound, Vol. 2"
