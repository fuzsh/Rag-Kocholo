It began in recordings by Southern Appalachian fiddle players who were recording in the late 1910s.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t until the early 1920s (in Southern USA), that Country Music as a viable recorded genre took hold. Eck Robertson made the first commercial country record in 1922 on the Victor Records label. From there it’s popularity grew exponentially.\n\nThe genre grew as musicians received record deals. Having their music played on the radio, made it accessible to the average person. However, by the late 1960s, Western music, in particular the cowboy ballad, was in decline.\n\nArtists were relegated to the ‘Country and Western’ genre by marketing agencies. From this, a new Country sound was born, and ever since, each new chapter hears a slight slant on the original sound but with the core values still in check.\n\nInterestingly in 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, its popularity dwarfing other much-loved genres.\n\nCountry Music Artists\n\nThere have been so many pioneers of Country Music. These include; Waylon Jennings, Patsy Cline, Emmylou Harris, George Jones, Townes Van Zandt, Merle Haggard, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, and Johnny Cash, to name a few.\n\nThe Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers’s performances strongly influenced later musicians. Their early recordings were of ballads and country dance tunes.\n\nThey featured the fiddle and guitar as lead instruments over a rhythmic foundation of guitar or banjo. An arrangement that still features today.\n\nNotably, In 1969 Linda Martell the American rhythm and blues and country music singer became the first African-American woman to perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1969.\n\nHer singing ability was honed in a gospel group she formed with her brothers, and she evolved into country music.\n\n“Country music has the great stories.” – Etta James\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame\n\nThe Country Music Hall of Fame is located in Nashville, Tennessee, and is arguably the world’s largest music museum.\n\nOpened in 1964 it has amassed an enormous music collection. They hold nearly 200,000 sound recordings, approximately 500,000 photographs, and more than 30,000 moving images.\n\nArtists Membership into the Country Music Hall of Fame is one of the biggest honours an artist can receive.\n\nWhere is Country Music in 2020?\n\nIn 2020, the purpose of country music hasn’t changed too much. Its core principles are the same. However, it has somewhat evolved with the times.\n\nThe lyric and the melody still grow together and have to move the listener. However, there has been a certain amount of diversification to the style.\n\nRock music heavily features these days, and we have witnessed the introduction of sub genres such as Country-Rock and Country-Pop. Artists such as Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift have once again brought Country Music to the forefront of popular music.\n\nConclusion\n\nCountry Music is a shared passion by many. If you are looking to learn a country music instrument, you are in good company.\n\nThe resurgence of the genre is always present and will continue to be a much-loved genre of music. String instruments feature heavily. So, whether you are a beginner or a seasoned professional, there is something for everyone.\n\n“There’s a longing in country music that can soften even the rockiest heart.” – Glen Campbell\n\nRelated Posts\n\nMXL 770 Condenser Microphone: All You Need To Know\n\nTypes of Instruments: ULTIMATE Guide (2021)"
