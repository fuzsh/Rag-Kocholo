The music often consists of ballads blended with Celtic and Irish fiddle songs. Country musicians were also often influenced by jazz and blues of African American tradition.\n\nThe term country music gained popularity during the 1940s. It eventually included many regional genres such as honky tonk, country boogie, western swing, and others.\n\nDuring its century-old history, country music has given birth to many stars and legends. In the past two years, the world lost many legendary country musicians. Here we talk about 8 of the oldest country musicians and their works.\n\n8.
