life?\"\n\n02 of 95\n\n\"The Bones,\" by Maren Morris\n\nLyrics of Love: \"When the bones are good, the rest don't matter/The paint could peel, the glass could shatter/Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same/When there ain't a crack in the foundation\"\n\n03 of 95\n\n\"Watermelon Moonshine,\" by Lainey Wilson\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Drinkin' watermelon moonshine/We cut the burn with a little

weak here in my knees/You put me right where I'm supposed to be/In your blue-eyed sea/And I wanna sail away\"\n\n05 of 95\n\n\"Forever After All,\" by Luke Combs\n\nLyrics of Love: \"They say nothing lasts forever/But they ain't seen us together/Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes/Just a t-shirt in the kitchen/With no make-up and a million/Other things that I could look at my whole life/A love like that makes a man have second thoughts/Maybe some things last forever after all\"\n\n06 of 95\n\n\"Diamonds or Twine,\" by Ryan Hurd\n\nLyrics of Love: \"When I look at you now/I see all I

\"You gotta dance with the one that brought you\n\nAnd stay with the one that want's you/The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home/Don't let the green grass fool you/Don't let the moon get to you/Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong\"\n\n08 of 95\n\n\"All of It,\" by Cole Swindell\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I wanna see you all city light lit up/I wanna see you in a pair of cut-up jeans/I wanna fall for all your magic/Feel all your teardrops drippin' on me\"\n\n09 of 95\n\n\"All to Myself,\" by Dan + Shay\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I'm jealous of the song that you've been singin'/And the way it's rollin' off your lips/It might be selfish but I'm thinkin'/I don't need nothin' between you/Leanin' for another kiss, yeah\"\n\n10 of 95\n\n\"Closer To You,\" by Carly Pearce\n\nLyrics of Love: \"There's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town/With the moon hanging for me and you, baby/We can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around\"\n\n11 of 95\n\n\"5 Foot 9,\" by Tyler Hubbard\n\nLyrics of Love: \"God makes five foot nine, brown eyes, and a sundress/Loves Tim McGraw and a small town accent/Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love/Jack makes good whiskey/but God makes the good stuff\"\n\n12 of 95\n\n\"Yours,\" by Russell Dickerson\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I came to life when I first kissed you/The best me has his arms around you/You make me better than I was before/Thank God I'm yours\"\n\n13 of 95\n\n\"Young Love & Saturday Nights,\" by Chris Young\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Here's to good girls that can't keep from falling/For bad boys that their daddies don't like/Small towns that keep staying small/Here's to old trucks, young love, and Saturday nights\"\n\n14 of 95\n\n\"Knockin' Boots,\" by

95\n\n\"Think I'm in Love With You,\" by Chris Stapleton\n\nLyrics of Love: I think I'm in love with you/I didn't know it at the time/I know what I want to do/It's making me lose my mind/I thought about thinking it through/And every time I do I find/I wanna make your dreams come true/I think I'm in love with you\n\n16 of 95\n\n\"Our World,\" by Smithfield\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Those were the nights that had no tomorrow/They went on and on and on just like tires on a '95 Bronco/Nobody to slow us down/Baby we were falling too fast\"\n\n17 of 95\n\n\"Love Story,\" by Taylor Swift\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone/I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run/You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess/It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'\"\n\n18 of 95\n\n\"God Gave Me To You,\" by Blake Shelton\n\nLyrics of Love: \"'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs/God gave me you for the days of doubt/For when I think I've lost my way/There are no words here left to say, it's true/God gave me you\"\n\n19 of 95\n\n\"Just a Kiss,\" by Lady A\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight/Just a touch of the fire burning so

like northern stars/Pointing me on my way into your loving arms/This much I know is true/That God blessed the broken road/That led me straight to you\"\n\n21 of 95\n\n\"Making Memories of Us,\" by Keith Urban\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I'm gonna be here for you baby/I'll be a man of my word/Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard/I wanna sleep with you forever\"\n\n22 of 95\n\n\"This Kiss,\" by Faith Hill\n\nLyrics of Love: \"It's the way you love me/It's a feeling like this/It's centrifugal motion/It's perpetual bliss/It's that pivotal moment/It's impossible/This kiss, this kiss\"\n\n23 of 95\n\n\"I Want Crazy,\" by Hunter Hayes\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I've searched the world and I know now/It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind/Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy/Are you with me baby? Let's be crazy\"\n\n24 of 95\n\n\"To Make You Feel My Love,\" by Garth Brooks\n\nLyrics of Love: \"When the evening shadows and the stars appear/And there is no one to dry your tears/I could hold you for a million years/To make you feel my love\"\n\n25 of 95\n\n\"Deeper than the Holler,\" by Randy Travis\n\nLyrics of Love: \"My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers/Higher than

Hill\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Better than I was/More than I am/And all of this happened/By taking your hand/And who I am now/Is who I wanted to be/And now that we're together/I'm stronger than ever, I'm happy and free\"\n\n28 of 95\n\n\"From This Moment On,\" by Shania Twain\n\nLyrics of Love: \"From this moment, life has begun/From this moment, you are the one/Right beside you is where I belong/From this moment on/From this moment, I have been blessed\"\n\n29 of 95\n\n\"Me and You,\" by Kenny Chesney\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Ordinary no, really don't think so/Not a love this true/Common destiny/We were meant to be/Me and you\"\n\n30 of 95\n\n\"Like Jesus Does,\" by Eric Church\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I always thought she'd give up on me one day/Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway/But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday/That she loves me like Jesus does\"\n\n31 of 95\n\n\"Cowboys and Angels,\" by Dustin Lynch\n\nLyrics of Love: \"We ride side by side/A cloud of
