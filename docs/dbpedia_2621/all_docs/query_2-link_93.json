African music is deeply rooted in the culture and history of the African people. African music has evolved over time, influenced by both the indigenous traditions of the continent and by the various cultures that have interacted with Africa over the centuries.\n\nToday, African music is enjoyed all over the world. African musical traditions have been incorporated into the music of many different cultures, resulting in a truly global phenomenon.\n\nSpread of African Music\n\nAfrican music has spread all over the world by the African diaspora. African musical traditions have been carried to other parts of the world by African Americans, who have played a significant role in shaping the music of many different cultures. African music has also been taken up by non-African cultures, such as Brazil and Cuba.\n\nThe popularity of African music continues to grow, as more and more people are exposed to its infectious rhythms and catchy melodies. African music is now enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds, all over the globe.\n\nIt truly is a truly global phenomenon, enjoyed by people of all cultures and backgrounds. The style of music has something to offer everyone, with its rich variety of traditions.\n\nThe Origins of African Music\n\nAfrican music was first recorded by Egyptian musicians in the 3rd millennium BC. The Egyptians used a wide variety of musical instruments, including harps, flutes, drums, and cymbals. African music was also influenced by the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD. Islamic music exerted a strong influence on African musical traditions, particularly in North Africa.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, traditional African music has been influenced by a number of factors, including the African slave trade, European colonialism, and the spread of Christianity. African music has also been influenced by African-American music, particularly in the form of jazz and blues.\n\nThere are a number of theories about the origins of African music. Some scholars believe that it originated with the sounds of animals and nature, while others believe that it was first created by humans as a way to express themselves. Whatever its origins, African music is an important part of the continent’s culture and history.\n\nThe Instruments of African Music\n\nAfrican music is characterized by a wide variety of musical instruments. The most commonly used African musical instruments include drums, xylophones, flutes, and horns.\n\nDrums are the most important African musical instruments. African drums come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and are used for a variety of purposes. African drums are used to keep time, to communicate, and to generate excitement.\n\nXylophones are another type of African musical instrument that is commonly used. Xylophones are percussion instruments that consist of a series of wooden bars that are struck with mallets. Xylophones originated in Africa, and their use has spread to other parts of the world as well. They are even a common instrument in today’s modern western symphony orchestra!\n\nFlutes and horns are also frequently used African musical instruments. Flutes are often used to provide accompaniment for singers, while horns are typically used as solo instruments.\n\nSome of the African musical instruments prevalent across the continent, in Sub-Saharan Africa, are as follows:\n\nMembranophones – drums of all types, including the talking drums which are used to communicate over long distances.\n\nAerophones – flutes, horns, and whistles.\n\nChordophones – stringed instruments such as the African harp, the kora, and the ngoni.\n\nIdiophones – percussion instruments such as the xylophone, maracas, and African bells.\n\nPercussion Instrument – include clapsticks, rain sticks, bells, gongs and pots\n\nThe Music of Africa Today\n\nAfrican music has evolved over time, influenced by both the indigenous traditions of the continent and by the various cultures that have interacted with Africa over the centuries. Today, African music is enjoyed all over the world. African musical traditions have been incorporated into the music of many different cultures, resulting in a truly global phenomenon.\n\nContemporary African music is a genre of music that includes a wide range of styles and influences from across the continent. contemporary African music is characterised by its use of traditional instruments, rhythms, and melodies, as well as its fusion with Western genres such as pop, rock, and hip-hop.\n\nThe Contemporary African music genre has become increasingly popular in recent years, with artists such as Wizkid, Yemi Alade, and Davido gaining international recognition. This music is a powerful force for unity and expression, and its popularity is only growing.\n\nGlossary\n\nA lot of terminologies used in African music are fairly unknown in the West. So we thought it would be useful to give you a list of the key terms used to represent styles of music:\n\nAfrobeat\n\nA term used by Fela Anikulapo Kuti to describe his fusion of West African with black American music.\n\nApala\n\nYoruba style of talking drum percussion from Nigeria.\n\nAxe\n\nYoruba word meaning “life force”, used to describe the Bahian style of Brazilian pop music popular in that country.\n\nBenga\n\nOriginating from the Luo people of Western Kenya, this style is widely popular throughout the country.\n\nChimurenga\n\nA popular style of music from the Shona people of Zimbabwe. Also called mbira-based music, one of the best examples of this sound is the music of Thomas Mapfumo.\n\nFuji\n\nNigerian Yoruba voice and percussion style using original African percussion instruments popularised by Kollington, Barrister, and Adewale Ayuba. A percussion conversation.\n\nGnawa\n\nMorrocan music of people descended from the slaves brought from Mali in the 16th century. This music features the stringed instruments sintir or gimbri, singing in unison, and hand clapping. Most often played at healing ceremonies.\n\nGriot\n\nGeneric term for a West African oral historian-cum-minstrel; a storyteller.\n\nHighlife\n\nDance music from Ghana and Eastern Nigeria originates from the popular kpanlogo rhythm developed in Ghana in the 60s.\n\nIsicathamiya\n\nTraditional Zulu call-and-response a cappella choral music sung by men from South Africa. Ladysmith Black Mambazo is the premier example of this style of music.\n\nJali\n\nManding word for a West African oral historian-cum-minstrel; a storyteller.\n\nJit\n\nHard, fast percussive Zimbabwean dance music, influenced by mbira-based guitar styles.\n\nJive\n\nGeneric South African term for popular music.\n\nJuju\n\nI.K. Dairo was credited with being the first modern Juju star. This popular style from Nigeria relies on the traditional Yoruba rhythms, but instead of being played on all percussive instruments as tradition demands the instruments in Juju are more Western in origin. Drum kit, guitars, keyboards, often pedal steel guitar and sometimes accordion (squeeze box) are used along with the traditional dun-dun (talking drum, or squeeze drum). King Sunny Ade is the most well-known of all Juju performers.\n\nKwassa Kwassa\n\nShake-your-booty dance style began in Zaire in the late ’80s popularised by Kanda Bongo Man.\n\nKwela\n\nSouth African pennywhistle (tin flute) music.\n\nMakossa\n\nCameroonian dance rhythm from the Douala region, also the name of the country’s most popular pop style typified by Manu Dibango.\n\nMarabi\n\nSouth African three-chord township music of the 1930s-1960s evolved into “African Jazz”.\n\nMarrabenta\n\nMozambique’s popular roots-based urban rhythm, a distinctive dance sound.\n\nMbalax\n\n(pronounced M’balah) Senegalese (Wolof) percussion music modernised by Youssou N’Dour, characterised by a sweet, funky combination of Afro-Cuban rhythms, Wolof drumming, and American pop.\n\nMbaqanga\n\nAlso sometimes called “Township Jive”, this South African township music was first popularised in the ’60s. Johnny Clegg and the Mahotella Queens are good examples of this sound.\n\nMorna\n\nfrom Cape Verde is a soulful genre often sung in Creole-Portuguese and played in a minor key emotional tone, mixing sentimental folk tunes filled with longing and sadness with the acoustic sounds of guitar, cavaquinho, violin, accordion, and clarinet.\n\nPalm Wine\n\nmusic originates in tropical Sierra Leone located on the far West coast of Africa. Typical of the Palm Wine sound are the light and airy guitar riffs originally played on acoustic guitar accompanied by traditional percussion instruments. Palm Wine is the sweet milky sap extracted from the palm tree. It ferments quickly and is a popular drink at bars and dance halls, as well as at social occasions where the music originated.\n\nRai\n\nYouthful pop music from Algeria. Rai’s typical themes of love and drinking have brought Rai singers into conflict with Islamic militants.\n\nReggae\n\nOriginally from Jamaica, this internationally played sound dominated by bass, drums (or often drum machine), and guitar chops is associated with the Rastafarian religion, liberation politics, and Ganga.\n\nSalsa\n\nNew York Puerto Rican adaption of Afro-Cuban music.\n\nSamba\n\nThe basic underlying rhythm that typifies most Brazilian music.\n\nSamba Reggae\n\n(pronounced sam-ba heg-gay), grew out of the blocos afros (Black carnival associations) a tradition begun in 1974 in Bahia, Salvador. The Bahian Carnival Associations with their afoxe (pronounced ah-fo-shay) drum sections are similar to Rio’s samba schools, with many surdos (big bass drums of varying sizes) and repineques (smaller, high-pitched drums) comprising the bulk of the rhythm section. Olodum is one of the first groups to popularise the sound.\n\nSOCA\n\ncomes from combining the words “soul” and “calypso”, is modern Trinidadian pop music.\n\nSoukous\n\nis a musical style that grew out of ’50s Cuban rumba music mixing the kwassa kwassa dance rhythm with zouk and rhumba. Many African artists, originally from the Congo (or Zaire), relocated to Paris, which became a popular expatriate community for them, and where they are mostly still based.\n\nWassoulou\n\na musical style from Mali typified by a strong Arabic feel along with the sound of the scraping kain yang, women play the fle, a calabash strung with cowrie shells, which they spin and throw into the air in time to the music.\n\nWere\n\nA Muslim style of music is performed most often as a wake-up call for early breakfast and prayers during Ramadan celebrations.\n\nZouk\n\nCreole slang word for “party.” Modern hi-tech Antillean music is produced mostly in Paris.\n\nKey African Artists\n\nLastly, we thought it would be helpful to list all the key artists who have made a difference in the world of African music.
