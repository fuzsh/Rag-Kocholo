        "text": "Learning an instrument can be one of the most rewarding experiences in life. Save The Music donates instruments to students and teachers across the country so that they may experience the joy and power of making music. These students who are just starting to learn music may choose to play the flute, trombone, recorder, or guitar. We hear from teachers that their students get better and better and continue to play into adulthood. Playing an instrument helps to build confidence, it gets your brain working in more complex ways, and makes you practice hard work and determination.\n\nPicking up an instrument for the first time is exciting and the musical skills you learn will last for a long time. Whenever you decide to learn an instrument, it will surely make a positive impact on your life. It’s not only a fun activity you can enjoy but also an opportunity to meet others and create music together.\n\nBut for any of that to happen, you need to find the best instrument to learn for your situation. Even though there are many easy instruments to learn for you to choose from, other factors for deciding what to play exist as well.\n\nSo, if you’re asking, “what instrument should I play?” or if you want to consider the available options before committing, you’re at the right place.\n\nWe’ll explore the key factors to consider when selecting instruments to learn, go through a list of the easiest instruments to learn, and explore a few helpful tips for mastering the instrument you end up choosing.\n\nDeciding Which Instrument to Learn\n\nCommitting to an instrument is a big decision. So you need to consider the key factors that might impact what is the easiest instrument to learn.\n\n• Your Goals. Think about what type of music you would like to play. Maybe the instrument you choose should help you play that type of music. If you would like to sing along with your instrument, the best instruments to learn would be keyboard or acoustic guitar. If you want to start a rock band, the best instruments to learn may be bass guitar or drums. Modern musicians, however, have learned to apply almost any instrument to different genres, so don’t be discouraged if the instrument you really want to play isn’t traditionally associated with your musical taste.\n\n• Abilities. If you can, it might be a good idea to try out a few instruments to see what feels more natural. Check out your local music retailer and ask to try holding some of the instruments in the store. You could also ask a friend or family member to try an instrument they may own. Finger size, hand size, coordination, and a variety of other factors can influence which instruments will be better suited for you. And if you have an easier time learning an instrument, that will help you stay motivated when lessons inevitably get tougher.\n\n• Cost. You can probably find a beginner-level option for any instrument that you might choose that will be most affordable. Keep in mind some instruments have a lower price tag than others, for example, an acoustic guitar or electric keyboard. Instruments like a grand piano, tuba, or double bass will be more expensive.\n\n• Passion. If you are interested and invested in an instrument you love, that means you will play it more often which means you will get better and better at playing it!\n\n5 Easy Instruments to Learn\n\nSome instruments are simply easier to learn than others. For example, a violin requires many years of practice to master, while you can pick up a guitar and be playing tunes much more quickly.\n\nIf you’re looking for an easy instrument to learn, any of these options fit the bill:\n\n1. HARMONICA\n\nOne of the easiest instruments you can try, which is also very popular in a variety of styles, is the harmonica. The great thing about harmonicas is that no matter what note you play, it will be in key, which means even complete beginners can sound good. Plus, you can easily fit it in your pocket, allowing you to practice on the go!\n\n2. GUITAR\n\nThere’s a reason why so many people start playing the guitar, usually, the acoustic guitar. Part of the popularity is the variety of styles you can play, but it’s also the accessibility and relative ease of learning that the instrument offers. Achieving the highest proficiency levels can take decades, but learning to play your favorite songs is much simpler, making it one of the easiest instrument to learn in many aspects.\n\n3. UKULELE\n\nNo list of the best musical instruments for beginners would be complete without the ukulele (one of my personal favorites). It’s seen a big rise in popularity over the last few years because it’s even simpler to learn than the guitar. The reduced number of strings means less time getting used to the fingerings, and the ukulele has a unique sound that can make any song sound great. As an added perk, ukuleles are also very affordable.\n\n4. KEYBOARD\n\nA keyboard, or electric piano, is a great way to learn how to read music and play your favorite songs. There are many beginner keyboards and songbooks that are available for a low cost. Keyboards also take up less space in your home than an acoustic piano. On an electric keyboard, you can control the volume, use special sound effects, and even compose your own music in no time.\n\n5. DRUMS\n\nA drum set you may see in a rock band may be too challenging to start with, but percussion instruments are good when looking for easy instruments to learn. Bongos, congas, or snare drums are all great options for learning how to keep a steady beat and create rhythmic patterns. This can be tough to master, but you will also need less musical theory to get started playing with others. Drums are also great for experimenting with rhythm and musical style.\n\nTips For Mastering Your Musical Instrument\n\nNo matter which instrument you end up choosing, one thing remains the same: setting up a good routine with fun, easy-to-use resources will help you get better at your instrument. Understanding the process of how to consistently improve and stay on course throughout the learning experience is as important as the instrument you choose.\n\nConsider these tips:\n\n• Choose the best instrument for you. As mentioned before, picking the right instrument for you is an integral part of sticking with it and enjoying even the more repetitive elements of the learning experience.\n\n• Develop a practice schedule. Even though there are many easy instruments to learn, you won’t master them overnight. The only way to get good is to practice at least a little each day, so try to work a practice time into your schedule and stick to it.\n\n• Seek out an education. Music is a complicated subject that encompasses music theory, performance, technique, and many other aspects. To help make sense of it all and track your progress, it’s a good idea to seek out music education that can keep you on the right track. There are many free learning materials and beginner musician apps out there. Check out our online music education resources page for ideas and programs."
