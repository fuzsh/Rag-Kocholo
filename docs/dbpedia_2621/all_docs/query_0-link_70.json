        "text": "\"Wait In The Truck\" -- HARDY and Lainey Wilson's just-released \"murder ballad\" collaboration -- highlights how two artists who readily discuss being steeped in the genre's traditions have successfully mirrored the genre's classic tropes in the modern era.\n\nThe soul-stirrer tells the story of an abused, hitchhiking woman who is physically and emotionally pained when picked up on the side of the road. Upon realizing she is a domestic abuse victim, and without question, the man who has picked her up decides to take retribution into his own hands. He drives back to the trailer where the abused woman's mate resides and shoots him. Five years later, the abuse victim, now married, visits the bittersweet, resolute, and morally justified assailant in prison.\n\nWilson's words on the chorus, as underscored by an acoustic guitar pluck -- and before a gospel choir wails a refrain -- are poignant:\n\n\"I don't know if he's an angel / Cause angels don't do what he did\n\nHe was hell-bent to find the man behind / All the whiskey scars I hid\n\nI never thought my day of justice / Would come from a judge under his seat\n\nBut I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me\n\nWait in the truck / Just wait in the truck\"\n\n\"The topic isn't talked about a lot; these are things that [often] happen behind closed doors,\" Wilson -- whose latest album, Bell Bottom Country, will be released on October 28 -- noted, exclusive for the Tennessean, on the red carpet of the recent ACM Honors event at the Ryman Auditorium. She then name-dropped Garth Brooks' 1990 classic \"The Thunder Rolls\" and The Chicks' 1999-released \"Goodbye Earl\" for the legendary artistic cues that inspired her performance.\n\n\"This one is going to start a conversation that a lot of people don't want to have, but it is our job as artists to sing about things that people are [sometimes] scared to talk about,\" Wilson added. \"Domestic abuse is a fragile subject, but I hope this song brings light to a situation that is more common than we’d like to admit. For the abusers, I hope this song haunts them. For the victims, I hope they know they’re not alone.\"\n\nHARDY has ridden the back of four years of hit singles written and performed by himself and myriad other artists, including breakaway country superstar Morgan Wallen, to achieve country music acclaim in 2022. Now that the genre's fans are back outside in multitudes and can scream along in unison to his collection of tracks that blossomed as favorites during quarantine, he's achieved a new level of fame.\n\nA press release notes that this song is \"launching HARDY's next chapter of hits.\"\n\n\"'Wait in the Truck’ has got to be one of, if not my best, work so far. Something very spiritual happened the day that we wrote that song,\" says HARDY about his work with the song'a trio of writers, Hunter Phelps, Jordan Schmidt, and Renee Blair.\n\n\"We just kind of looked down at our pen and paper and we looked up and the song was written, it was amazing to be a part of it. It speaks on something very important, domestic violence. At the end of the day I just really hope that this gives somebody a platform to speak out.\""
