        "text": "I'm a little skeptical of the threatened lawsuit angle here. I've done a lot of reading about country music over the years, and am very familiar with the story of how the tune was passed down through several iterations. (In fact, you actually missed one that predates The Carter Family: \"Thrills I Can't Forget\" by John Ferguson from 1927.) And I've never before heard of a lawsuit involving Hank's song and Kitty's answer to it.\n\nIn doing a fairly robust Google Search just now, I found only ONE reference (from a somewhat questionable source) to a lawsuit being threatened over Kitty's response to Hank's hit. This includes several rather extensive stories about the two songs and their genesis. Yet none of these stories mentioned this.\n\nAnd the fact is, Hank Thompson would have had no grounds for a lawsuit in any case â€” only the song's composer would have.\n\nGiven the long tradition of \"answer songs\" in all genres of music (not just country), I don't see how anyone could have seriously considered this course of action.\n\nDo you have a specific cite for the notion you put forth? That is, that someone contemplated a lawsuit over \"The Wild Side of Life\"/\"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky-Tonk Angels\"?\n\nGood find on Thrills I Can't Forget, never came across it before.\n\nAfter a little searching, you may well be right about there never having been the threat of a lawsuit over Kitty's answer record. Not sure where I first heard the story, probably somebody I had a gig with, but I've been telling the story forever!"
