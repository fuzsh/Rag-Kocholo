        "text": "\"Angel of the Morning\" is a popular song written by Chip Taylor that has been recorded numerous times and has been a hit single for various artists includingMerrilee Rush, Juice Newton, Nina Simone, P.P. Arnold, Olivia Newton-John, The Pretenders/Chrissie Hynde, Dusty Springfield, Mary Mason, Melba Montgomery, and Billie Davis.\n\nContents[]\n\n[hide] *1 Original and charting versions\n\n2 Versions by Chip Taylor\n\n3 Non-charting cover versions\n\n4 Translated versions\n\n5 Film and television\n\n6 Versions (English language-chronology)\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nOriginal and charting versions[edit][]\n\nWritten and composed by New York-born songwriter Chip Taylor, \"Angel of the Morning\" was originally offered to Connie Francis to sing, but she turned it down because she thought that it was too risqué for her career.[citation needed] The song's narrator describes the breakup of a presumably illicit love affair: \"If morning's echo says we've sinned, well, it was what I wanted now.\"\n\nTaylor produced a recording of the song with Evie Sands but the financial straits of Cameo-Parkway Records, who had Sands on their roster, reportedly prevented either that version's release or its distribution. Other early recordings of \"Angel of the Morning\" were made in 1967 by Danny Michaels for Lee Hazelwood's LHI label and by UK vocalist Billie Davis.\n\n\"Angel of the Morning\" finally became a hit in the spring and summer of 1968 via a recording by Merrilee Rush made that January at American Sound Studios in Memphis with Chips Moman and Tommy Cogbill producing. Rush had come to Memphis through the group she fronted: the Turnabouts, being the opening act for a Paul Revere and the Raiders tour; while in Memphis the Raiders recorded the albumGoing to Memphis at American Sound Studios, an association which led to Rush's discovery by Tommy Cogbill who'd been hoping to find the right voice for the song \"Angel of the Morning\" - he'd kept a tape of the demo of that song constantly in his pocket for several months. Rush recorded \"Angel of the Morning\" and the tracks which would comprise her Angel of the Morning album with the American Sound houseband although the single and the album would be credited to the group Merrilee Rush & the Turnabouts.[1] The \"Angel of the Morning\" single was released in February 1968 to reach the Top 10 on theBillboard Hot 100 that June peaking at No. 7. A No. 1 hit in Canada,[2] Australia and New Zealand, \"Angel of the Morning\" also afforded Rush a hit in the Netherlands (No. 4). \"Angel of the Morning\" earned Rush a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary-Pop Vocal Performance, Female. Rush would cut a new version of the song for her 1977 eponymous album release. Rush's version of \"Angel of the Morning\" would be featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Girl, Interrupted - whose time frame is 1967-68 - in which composer Chip Taylor's niece Angelina Jolie had a starring role.\n\nIn the United Kingdom where the Merrilee Rush version had failed to reach the Top 50 stalling at No. 55, \"Angel of the Morning\" reached No. 29 in August 1968 via a rendition by P.P. Arnold[3] who had sung background on the 1967 Billie Davis version; Arnold's version was produced by Andrew Loog Oldham. In 1977 Mary Mason also had a UK Top 30 hit with her version (in fact a medley of two Chip Taylor songs: \"Angel of the Morning - Any Way That You Want Me\"), which reached No. 27.[4] British act Guys 'n' Dolls had a hit in the Netherlands in 1977 with \"Angel of the Morning\", their version reaching No. 11 on the Dutch chart.\n\nThe most successful C&W version of the song - tying with the Juice Newton version discussed in the paragraph below - is the 1978 release by Melba Montgomery which reached No. 22 on the Billboard C&W chart. Previously \"Angel of the Morning\" had appeared on the Billboard C&W chart via a rendition by Connie Eaton (No. 34, 1970).\n\nThe highest-charting and best-selling version in the United States was recorded and released in 1981 by country-rock singer Juice Newton for her album Juice, released on Capitol Records. Newton remade the song at the suggestion of Steve Meyer who promoted Capitol Records product to radio stations and felt \"Angel of the Morning\" would be a strong candidate to attain airplay for Newton.[5] Newton's version reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 22 on the Billboard country music chart, and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart in April of that year.[6][7] The recording also earned Newton a Grammy nomination in the same category as Rush's 1968 hit. More than 1 million units of Newton's single of the song were sold in the United States, and the single reached the Top 10 in a number of other countries, including Canada and Australia. In the UK, this recording reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart, marking the song's third appearance on that chart without becoming a truly major hit.[8] Newton recorded the song again in 1998 for her The Trouble with Angels album.\n\nThe Shaggy song \"Angel\" heavily samples \"Angel of the Morning\", using the melody with different words for the sung refrain.\n\nSwedish singer Jill Johnson released \"Angel of the Morning\", with lyrics in English, in 2007 from her cover album Music Row. This version peaked at No. 30 at the Swedish singles chart.\n\nVersions by Chip Taylor[edit][]\n\nIn 1972, Taylor released a version on Buddah 325.

The UK release (Trojan TR-622) had \"Love Letters\" by Phyllis Dillon and Alton Ellis as the B-side. It also appeared on the compilation album Soul Of Jamaica a.k.a.

The song was released as a single but did not chart.\n\nThe short-lived British girl band Thunderbugs recorded an upbeat version of the song for their 1999 debut album, Delicious.\n\nIn 2003 Maggie Reilly recorded \"Angel of the Morning\" for her album Save It for a Rainy Day.\n\nThe Boston-based band Tijuana Sweetheart (then named VAGIANT) released a cover on their debut album, Public Display of Infection.\n\nThe Atlanta-based band Girlyman released a cover on its 2007 live album, Somewhere Different Now.\n\nVintage British Invasion group The Tremeloes recorded the song in 1987 as an attempted comeback single.\n\nTranslated versions[edit][]\n\nA number of non-English versions of \"Angel of the Morning\" have been recorded including the following:\n\nIn Czech as \"Dál jen vejdi\" a 1989 single by Věra Martinová\n\nIn Dutch as \"Vlinder van een zomer\" a 1968 single by Willeke Alberti.\n\nIn French as \"Au revoir et à demain\" a 1967 single by Liliane Saint-Pierre.\n\nIn Finnish as \"Kaipuu\" a 1968 single by Pertti Willberg and also as \"Jos Itket Silloin\" recorded by Pirjo Lehti for her 1985 Se On Rakkautta Oikeaa album.\n\nIn Italian as \"Gli occhi verdi dell'amore\" which was a 1969 hit in Italy at No. 9 for I Profeti.\n\nIn German as \"Der Engel der Verdammten\" by Juliane Werding on her 1975 album Wenn du denkst, dass du denkst, dann denkst du nur, du denkst and also as \" \"Ich bin dein Engel bis zum Morgen\" a 1981 single by Suzanne Klee.\n\nIn Spanish as \"Ángel de la Mañana\" by Enrique Guzmán in 1975.\n\nIn Swedish as \"En enda morgon\" recorded by Elisabeth Andreassen for her 1981 album Angel of the Morning and also as \"Nattens sista ängel\" recorded by Wizex for their 1982 album Nattfjäril.

The Rush version is also played during a scene in the 1978 film Fingers, where it is used to accentuate the conflicted nature of the main character played by Harvey Keitel. The song was performed live by Chrissie Hynde in a 1995 episode of Friends titled \"The One with the Baby on the Bus\", and that version also appears in that show's soundtrack album. The song also makes an appearance in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire, with Tom Cruise's titular character singing what appears to be the original version, enthusiastically if badly. More recently, Conan O'Brien has referenced the track, during periodic ironic pledges to cease his show's use of arbitrary & stupid humor in which he presents a gorilla dressed as a nurse who uses an old-fashioned abdominal exerciser while enjoying the song.
