        "text": "Wednesday, 2 November 2022. Tonight we have Hank Thompson, known to me from one of the records my sister got with the purchase of her house and from the Kitty Wells song “It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels”, a rebuttal to his 1952 smash hit “The Wild Side Of Life”.\n\nWednesday, 10 November 2021. Finished listening to American IV: The Man Comes Around and I think the second half isn’t quite as strong as the first half. Still a great album though! “Tear Stained Letter” was my favourite today."
