        "text": "Post by austin on\n\nOh ok. This does nothing for me as a single but I know it‚Äôs one of the few people were raving about when the album came out, so I hope it does well even if I change the station.\n\nI actually still love this album but I was hoping for something else, either ‚ÄúChurch Boots,‚Äù ‚ÄúUs Someday‚Äù or even the duet with Katy Perry.\n\nPost by raylatch98 on\n\nUgh, the Katy Perry duet is right there and has potential to be huge, not to mention Male/Female duets are pretty huge right now (in the year end Country Aircheck Top 100 for this year 3 of the Top 15 songs are male/female duets not to mention a total of 10 duets in general make up the Top 50).\n\nThis is fine but it feels like another one of his singles that is gonna go to #1 or close to it and be forgotten of within a year or two outside of the diehard Thomas Rhett fans.\n\nPost by someguy on\n\nThis is a disappointing single choice. I don't think that Where We Started is the greatest album, but there were some much better choices. I don't understand the thinking that this is a better choice than the title track. That should absolutely be the next single.\n\nPost by üå∫CountryLineDancer on\n\nThis is fine, has a solid melody, but not really memorable. I'm honestly okay with this choice, as I don't love most of the songs on this album, except for the first two singles, and Katy Perry duet is rather disappointing. I'm ready for Country Again #2, if that ever happens.\n\nPost by Music Fan on\n\nSo after spending money on a (admittedly mediocre) video, getting Katy to perform the song with TR a few times, and seeing a good public reception to \"Where We Started,\" they decided to go another route? How is that even logical lol.\n\nPost by recordyear on\n\nApparently the new billing actually means new version of this song, which is just released today. Big Machine Label Group artists (Jackson Dean, Callista Clark in last two weeks) surely like to release new versions of new radio singles lately.\n\nPost by austin on\n\nI understand wanting to re-produce this for radio to make it sound more like a hit but this new version lacks emotion, in my opinion. I don‚Äôt care too much for the original anyway but I particularly didn‚Äôt like this.\n\nPost by .indulgecountry on\n\nThis has had the oddest chart run of any Thomas Rhett single in recent history. It started off at radio like it was going to be his biggest smash in awhile, then it kinda fell off for a bit, then it got a nice second wind, and then it has started to plateau again. Kinda odd hot-and-cold reception to this one so far.\n\nLiterally the Katy Perry duet is right there begging to smash. Please be next.\n\nI'd be shocked if we get another single from this era. I'm almost certain they'll move on to new music once this peaks. He's already teased a side B to the Country Again project, and he hasn't gone more than 3-deep on an album in five years.\n\nPost by zaclord üåà on\n\nAs someone who has enjoyed TR's output more than most here, the 3 singles from this album have all been underwhelming, as was this whole record. Let's move onto the next era once \"Angels\" tops out (which is hopefully sooner rather than later) please.\n\nPost by üå∫CountryLineDancer on\n\nI am reviving Thomas Rhett RD here, so hope to see many of you joining!!\n\nThis song is growing on me after going to his concert, as I quite enjoyed his vocal performance on this one. That said, this is one of the most underwhelming singles from him, so I hope he has a stronger lead single and album on its way.\n\nPost by zdm1998 on\n\nFeel like this has been a relatively quiet single for him. I remember it started off relatively strong to where many thought it would be a big hit, but seems to have just been quietly climbing the chart, with little impact.\n\nPost by recordyear on\n\nJust realized that he was not in ACM Awards nor CMA Fest which is strange especially considering he won an Entertainer of the Year not long ago. Seems Big Machine is all in Carly Pearce instead.\n\nPost by austin on\n\nFeel like this has been a relatively quiet single for him. I remember it started off relatively strong to where many thought it would be a big hit, but seems to have just been quietly climbing the chart, with little impact.\n\nYeah, I never liked this as a single but I was excited to see it appear to be taking off but now it‚Äôs such a non-event I am back to being upset it‚Äôs released lol. This album was a step up from his recent work, IMO, but this song isn‚Äôt one I ever revisit.\n\nPost by er1c612 on\n\nI like this song, and I‚Äôm a pretty big fan of Thomas Rhett, but his single choices as of late don‚Äôt make a lot of since to me. I guess if it goes to #1 then it‚Äôs a success, but it seems like the duet with Katy Perry ‚ÄúWhere We Started‚Äù should‚Äôve been released over ‚ÄúHalf of Me‚Äù and I would‚Äôve preferred Church Boots over this. Really, aside from Slow Down Summer, I feel like his single choices have been questionable since when he didn‚Äôt release Notice off the Center Point Road album to radio."
