"Holiday in Your Heart" Promotion[]

"On the Side of Angels" was featured in the 1997 TV movie Holiday in Your Heart, which starred Rimes herself. Being in the movie caused the song to gain unexpected success and acknowledgement, which caused some to consider the song as an "unofficial/promotional single". The live performance of the song from the movie has been misinterpreted on YouTube, often circulating around with the label "music video".

Lyrics[]

Lyrics taken from Metrolyrics.[1]

I've never been so certain

I've never been sure

We're on the side of angels

If we believe this love is pure

Is it so hard to trust it

'Cause we've been wrong before?

There comes a time in every life

We find the heart we're waiting for

After all the 'Might-have-beens'

The close and distant calls

After all the 'Try-agains'

Don't be afraid to fall

We're on the side of angels after all

Every time you touch me

Don't you feel it too?

The gentle hand that's guiding us

You to me, me to you

After all the 'Might-have-beens'

The close and distant calls

After all the 'Try-agains'

Don't be afraid to fall

We're on the side of angels after all

Heaven only knows

Why this took so long

But only Heaven knows

A love is right or wrong

After all the 'Might-have-beens'

The close and distant calls

After all the 'Try-agains'

Don't be afraid to fall

We're on the side of angels

On the side of angels

On the side of angels, after all

Ooh, yeah

On the side of angels

Ooh
