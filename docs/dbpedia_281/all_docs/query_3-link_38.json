        "text": "Little known to most, Iran’s northern crescent is home to some of the world’s most pristine temperate rain forests. This area, on the northern side of the Alborz Mountains, includes over 1,000 kilometers of coastline and spans four different provinces. Gilan, sometimes written Guilan, is the most picturesque of these provinces and is easily accessible, from Tehran, Iran’s capital.\n\nFor all tips for travel to Rasht and Gilan, read on.\n\nClimate & Geography\n\nAs you travel north into Gilan, there is an abrupt change in the terrain. The border town of Rudbar welcomes visitors to Gilan with its roadside restaurants and shops selling local produce such as olives, pickles, and pottery. Passing through Rudbar, you cross the Sefid River, a fast-flowing snow-fed stream that flows all the way to the Caspian Sea. Travel 20 kilometers further into Gilan and all signs of aridness disappear, giving way to thick, green forests. Welcome to Gilan!\n\nThe forests are what make Gilan so special. Temperate rain forests are quite uncommon, only existing in a handful of locations globally. The quintessential features of these forests are high rainfall and low temperatures which allow for lots of moss and ferns. Gilan’s botanical biodiversity will not disappoint. Beech, Elm, Poplar, Oak and the prized Persian Ironwood grow everywhere. Stopping anywhere on the road side, you can graze on the wild raspberries and pomegranate. To top it off, poppies, St John’s Wort, Milk Thistle, Oregano, Camomile, and other medicinal plants grow wild in the mountains.\n\nAlso check out: The best road trips in Iran\n\nVisitors can enjoy a unique Gilan experience year round.

Winters are cold and the mountains will be snowcapped from December through to March- April. Gilan is much wetter than the majority of Iran, so you can expect rains anytime during the year and long rainy periods are also common.\n\nPeople & Culture\n\nBoth linguistically and ethnically unique, the people of Gilan are renowned for their cuisine, relaxed lifestyle and bossy women. Gilan has two languages – Gilaki and Talashi. Gilaki was traditionally spoken by the low-land people and Talashi is the tongue of the mountain people.
