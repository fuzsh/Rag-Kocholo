She died on Friday, plunging the country into social unrest.\n\nThe protests on Monday were reminiscent of large demonstrations in 2009, as thousands of women seemed to be leading the movement, with the critical difference that after 13 years many Iranians have come to reject the clerical system as a whole rather than any particular policy or decision.\n\nMany women took off their headscarves not only in Tehran but even small, traditional towns, to protests the policy of forced hijab. Protesters also chanted slogans against the country’s aging ruler, Ali Khamenei who has increasingly tightened the rule of religious hardliners and his own loyal supporters. He has also resisted reaching an agreement with the United States that would lift sanctions and help the ailing economy.\n\nAlthough the demonstration at the bazaar has already started, activists have called for more protests in central parts of Tehran at 6:00 pm local time or 9:30 am Washington DC time.
