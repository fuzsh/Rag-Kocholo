        "text": "Everywhere in the world, food is the most important thing and represents the culture and history of the people. Nothing influences the food of a region as much as geography. In Gilan province a unique climate (seas, rivers, forests, rainfall, and lush areas) has brought a variety of agricultural products to this area.\n\nThe diversity of food (170 recipes) in the city of Rasht has led to the registration as the creative city of food in UNESCO. Some of this foods have been registered nationally.\n\nIt’s interesting to know that Gilani people have special pots which name is Gamaj. These pots are made from clay.

To make Mirza Ghasemi you need eggplants (with smoky taste), garlic, tomatoes and eggs. You can eat this delicious meal with bread as well as rice.

He was into cooking very much. After his returning from St. Petersburg to Iran, he invented this food and made it famous in Rasht under his own name.\n\nTorshi Tareh\n\nTo cook this famous Rashti dish, you will need a variety of indigenous herbs of Gilan such as parsley, coriander, spinach, beetroot, raw garlic, eggs and spices. Adding flour to this stew is optional and helps its taste to seem better. It can be served along with bread, rice and salty or smoky fish.\n\nBaghali Ghatogh\n\nBaghali Ghatogh is one of the most beloved stews in Gilan, with its unique smell and taste. It’s prepared with the combination of dill, garlic, turmeric, salt and eggs and as its name implies special kind of bean known as peeled bean or Pache Baghala. Unlike other grains, these beans are sold without skin, dusted and fresh. Eat this stew especially along with Iranian rice once, you will love it forever.\n\nFesenjan\n\nFor cooking this excellent food, you need chopped nuts) walnut, almond, hazelnut (, pomegranate sauce and meat, mostly chicken’s or bird’s meat.\n\nFesenjan is a formal Iranian food that served in weddings or Nowrouz (New Year) ceremony and this kind of occasions. In some expert’s opinion, it is considered as the oldest Iranian food and its history is attributed to the Gilan County, as well as researchers attribute its age to the Sassanid era. In different parts of Iran this food has different recipe. For example, in the central region of Iran, it is cooked in sweet form.\n\nAnarbij\n\nUsing meat, scented vegetables such as leek, parsley, coriander, walnut, pomegranate sauce and pomegranate seeds, Gilani people make a food called Anarbig. This food which is so similar to Fesenjan is served as a main dish along with unrivaled Gilan’s rice.\n\nKal Kabab\n\nKalkabab is known as a Gilani gourmet appetizer with a majestic taste. Its recipe is so easy and you will need grilled eggplant, garlic, pomegranate, pomegranate juice, fragrant vegetable and crushed walnuts.

Most of the time, it’s served with Kateh (boiled rice)\n\nMorgh-e Torsh (Sour Chicken)\n\nSour chicken stew is one of Gilani’s most popular and tasty dishes in Gilan. As we don’t use pomegranate juice in its recipe, it is different from the Mazandarani form of Sour Chicken. Needed ingredients for Gilani Sour Chicken are chicken, onion, egg, garlic, beans, fragrant herbs (turmeric, parsley, coriander, peppermint and grapefruit), orange juice, salt, pepper, turmeric. Serve it along with rice and other Gilani appetizers and enjoy a new, different and of course delicious flavor.\n\nKateh-Kebab\n\nKateh-Kabab or Rashti Polo Kebab is one of the main traditional cuisines in Gilan. It’s also one of the most common and preferable ones. For preparing this meal, people in Gilan lay down meat, mostly beef, in yogurt, olive oil, onion water, salt and pepper for more than ten hours. After that, they grill the meat. Eating this food along with rice will be a delightful experience for you.\n\nFish\n\nFish is one of the main food in Gilan and has lots of fans and of course lots of species and recipes. We want to introduce you smoky kind of it. The Smoky or salty fish that is prepared ready-made from the daily market is so well-known in Gilan. The method of preparing smoky fish is putting a small piece of fish in a bowl of preparing rice. As it’s so salty, this kind of fish isn’t considered as a main dish but it serves with a variety of stews."
