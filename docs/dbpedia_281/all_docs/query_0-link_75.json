        "meta_description": "The first and most important goal of all governments is development. Surely one of the most important factors of development is economic development, but this is not the only parameter since development is not merely an economic phenomenon. Intense population focus and imbalance are characteristic of third world countries, resulting from polarized growth policies. So, a limited number of areas have key roles and the other areas act as marginal. The first step to solve this problem is to understand disparities in economic, social, and cultural aspects. This research seeks to measure the degree of development of the cities of Gilan province, Iran. According to some development indexes in order to obtain the rates and causes of regional inequalities along with a way to reduce the underdevelopment of the region. Therefore, economic indexes have been used. After the analysis of the model, the results indicated that there is a fundamental difference among the cities with respect to development indexes; they are ranked based on developmental degrees as follow: Rasht, Bandar Anzali, Astaneh Ashrafieh, Lahijan, Roudbar, Masal, Rudsar, Amlash, Siahkal, Some'esara, Langrood, Shaft, Astara, Rezvanshahr, Fuman, and Talesh.",
