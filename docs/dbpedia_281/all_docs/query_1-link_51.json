        "text": "Evaluation of information systems is needed to determine the quality of system use. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the success of an information system, one of which is the DeLone and McLean model, which consists of six factors measuring the success of an information system. SIAMIK is an academic information system designed to meet the minimum requirements needed in processing academic information. This research is divided into several stages to test the 10 initial hypotheses. The data collected were 1560 correspondents from questionnaires distributed to students as SIAMIK users. Furthermore, the results of the validity and reliability tests were continued with SEM analysis for hypothesis testing. The evaluation results were obtained for the 10 hypotheses that have been formed. there are 3 accepted hypotheses and 7 rejected hypotheses. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of SIAMIK within the scope of Atma Jaya Makassar University has not been successful.\n\nAim: Studies have been conducted focusing on citizens' participation in urban planning and their right to the city, which have been raised as a criticism of non-participatory and non-communicative urban planning. In this research, an attempt has been made to explain the process of changing the site of Takab Hospital, using the theory of the production of space and Lefebverian trialectics, to be able to identify the dimensions of this site change and its consequences. Material & Method: With a descriptive-analytic method and applicative approach, with the help of the network analyst tool in ArcMap, the access status of citizens to the new hospital was evaluated in front of the old hospital by building a new area instrument at a standard distance, as one of the examples of their lived space. Finding: The analysis showed that citizens' access to the new hospital within the standard access radius was about one-third of the access to the old hospital. Conclusion: This case is inferred as an example of inattention to the urban lived space and a manifestation of the distance between the planner and the citizen, which shows the lack of correct understanding of the citizens as the audience of the programs. As a result, the city planners' action to change the hospital's site reveals its negative effect in the form of an increase in the access distance of the citizens to the hospital. Innovation: The innovative aspect of this article is integrating Henri Lefebvre's Production Of Space theory with communicative turn in urban planning; it is avoided only addressing and analyzing the spatial dimensions of the hospital site change. However, social and linguistic aspects also intervene in this spatial analysis."
