        "text": "Rasht is the capital city of Gilan Province, Iran. Also known as the “City of Rain” , it had a population of 956,971 as of the 2016 census and is the most densely populated city of Iran.\n\nRasht is the largest city on Iran’s Caspian Sea coast. Due to being between the coast and the mountains, the local environment is rainy with humid subtropical and mediterranean influences. It also has temperate rainforest to its south, contrasting to the mostly arid Iran. It is a major trade center between Caucasia, Russia, and Iran using the port of Bandar-e Anzali. Rasht is also a major tourist center with the resort of Masouleh in the adjacent mountains and the beaches of Caspian as some of the major attractions.\n\nHistorically, Rasht was a major transport and business center which connected Iran to Russia and the rest of Europe, and because of this was known as the “Gate of Europe”. The city has a history that goes back to the 13th century but its modern history dates back to the Safavid era during which Rasht was a major silk trade center with numerous textile workshops.\n\nHistoric Municipality of Municipality\n\nOne of the famous buildings in the city of Rasht, the city of rain, is the municipality building of Rasht, which is also known as the mansion or the palace of the municipality. According to sources, the construction of this beautiful mansion took between three and four years, about six years, and was designed by a German-Armenian architect named Sardarov who lived in Rasht. The architect took a broad look at the buildings built in the city of St. Petersburg, the former capital of Russia and one of its current famous cities."
