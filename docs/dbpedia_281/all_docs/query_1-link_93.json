Did you know that Rasht City, the capital of Gilan Province, is one of the only 26 cities in the entire world that is a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy? The city doesn’t only preserve ancient Persian recipes but traditional cooking methods, cookware and utensils as well. Rasht’s must-try dishes include Mirza Qasemi, Torsh-e Tareh, Anar-Bij, Sir-Qelyeh, Baqali-Qatoq, kal Kabab, Aloo Mosamma and sour Kebab just to name a few. Are you salivating? Cause we are!"
