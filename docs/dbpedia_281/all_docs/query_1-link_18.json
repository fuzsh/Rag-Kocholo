But in terms of urban history, the first time Hamda … Mostofi mentioned it in the eighth century AH. The old name for Rasht was Daralmorz or Daralaman, which was referred to as Bihar before the two.\n\nIn the dictionaries, the river or estuary has been designated between the two rivers, and it seems that the reason for its naming is to be located between the two rivers, which were considered as shields and walls of the city. Rashti’s facade in desatir culture means gypsum to solidify the foundations, stones and bricks, and in the dictionaries of Ara, Anandraj, Fars Asadi, Shoushtari local vocabulary, Argument, Nazim al-Ataba and Jahangiri vocabulary: something that Collapse; everything that collapses and collapses; the wall facing down. The plaster is also said to make the house white; the sludge; the soils; the soils;\n\nDehkhoda believes that since the city of Rasht was built in the year AH, so the name of this place has been used as a matter of history and the word Rasht is in the name of Abjad.\n\nThe development of the city of Rasht started from the time of Shah Abbas Safavi, who was then a Qusayr, and during the Qajar period, due to the economic development of Iran and Russia, the old name of the localities of the city of Rasht, which mostly reflects the occupation of its inhabitants. , Are also included in travelogues, with the exception of two or three of which are known and known by their old names, most of which are:\n\nSagharisazan; Roadbartan; Zahedan Kheyran; Daghaghian; Kozhran; Chehelan Khomehan; Chahar Khaneh; The city of Rasht is considered. This ancient texture, while being a part of the cultural heritage and reminiscent of the relics, traditions and traditions of ancient times, can be one of the significant problems in the urban context of this city. Rasht, known as the city of silver rains. It is the capital of Guilan province, and for the first time its name is mentioned in the book about al-Alam, written in the year AH, with a large area.\n\nRasht became the capital of Guilan Province and the center of the Noghan and Silk Transactions of Shah Abbas from 6 AH at the time, the first product of Gilan. This led to the great owners and Iranian, Russian, Greek, and Armenian merchants who were silk merchants of Silk, and the city of Rasht grew dramatically.\n\nMurgunov, a Russian tourist who had traveled to Rasht in the year 6 AH, wrote in his memoirs that the city had two houses, a shop, and two people at that time. In his view, Rasht was a city well endowed with beautiful seaside homes where traders from India, Bukhara, Rome and the Ottomans traveled in silk soda. Guilan became one of the focal points of Iran’s political, social and economic developments during the constitutional period and afterwards. The independence movement of the jungle, the expansion of cities, the establishment of numerous schools and the promotion of the culture of the citizens of Rasht made it one of the most progressive cities in the country."
