        "text": "Rasht\n\nCapital of the Gilan province, Rasht is a major city in the Caspian Sea region. It is a distribution center of agricultural products from fertile lands in the north of the country, and a main transportation hub between the Caucasus, Russia and Iran; thus, a major trading center.\n\nA lively and active life style is apparent in the trade activities all over the city in the daytime, and in the busy restaurants, movie theatres, and crowded streets in the city center at night.\n\nRasht's Bazaar\n\nRasht is known for its unique cuisine, particularly its seafood and its traditional rustic life style. This can be best observed during the day in its open air bazaar, with its many small food stores and vendors from surrounding villages offering fresh produce, eggs, live chickens and ducks, olives, fish... and shoppers busy bargaining in the packed alleys in the baazar and adjacent streets.\n\nLahijan-Langerud\n\nLahijan - This attractive city is surrounded by rice paddies and gentle mountains blanketed with tea plantations. It is known for its tea leaves and its Kolucheh (pastry filled with walnut-paste).\n\nA township east of Lahijan built on the slopes of the Alborz mountains and irrigated by the Langerud river. The river flows into the Caspian Sea 8 km from Langerud at the site of the popular beach resort of Chamkhaleh.\n\nDistricts of Rasht\n\nThe city of Rasht is located in the center of the Gilan province, surrounded by forests and diverse agricultural regions. In the south, it borders the olive groves of Rudbar, known as the olive capital of the country; in the east, Kuchesfehan and Lasht-e Nesha are two of the major rice growing regions of the province, and in the west, the Fuman area cultivates rice as well as tea. In the north, Anzaly is Iran's largest seaport on the Caspian Sea."
