        "text": "Rasht is a city in the north of Iran around 40 km from the shore of the Caspian Sea. Rasht is known in Iran for its beauty and its parks. People for all around the country come there to experience much wetter and colder climate than the rest of the country. It is the capital of the northern Iranian province of Guilan. All in all Rasht and its surroundings offer a starkly different experience from southern Iran.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nFirstly you must see the Golsar area in the north of the city. It's the most modernized section of the city, you can find the youth roaming over there, beautiful shops and restaurants. You find yourself in a European country in the middle of an Asian civilization.\n\nGolsar, pronounced golsâr (Persian: گلسار), is a suburb of Rasht. Golsar used to be a very small neighborhood so that a chain gate had been put at the entrance before 1979. A few security guards were always monitoring and taking care of this gate. During the past couple of decades the demand for living in Golsar raised so that the area of this neighborhood started to grow rapidly. This area of Rasht is now the most expensive place in the city to purchase a house or apartment.\n\nGolsar is filled with shops, restaurants, boutiques and coffee shops, and is the most popular place for teenagers and young adults to meet and socialize with peers. This crowd is due to an opportunity for young girls and guys to meet each other and exchange their phone numbers for either long-term or short-term relationships.\n\nMasouleh historical village is a spectacular little village built on such a steep slope that the roads inside the village lie on the roofs of the houses below. A walk around town is very pleasant.\n\nBandar-e-Anzali is Iran's main Caspian port. You will see fish markets and large ships from the countries around the Caspian. For 200,000 rials per hour for an entire boat you can go on a motorboat ride through the harbor and into the large lagoon. The boat drivers often suggest that since you are in \"Lagoonland\" women should be allowed to remove their headscarves. It is a good opportunity since after wearing the scarf for long a breeze through the hair on a motorboat is most welcome!\n\nRudkhan Castle medieval castle made of brick and stone. It is located 50 km southwest of Rasht and driving there takes about 1 hr. From the parking area you hike up to the castle (1 hr) through the forest passing waterfalls and tea shops. 200,000 rials entrance fee is paid at the castle.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nRasht and the surrounding towns of the Caspian province are a great place to try still-warm, walnut-filled koloocheh cookies. Look for stores selling cookies with round patterns embossed on them (they say the best ones are sold in nearby Fuman). You can buy some kind of dooghs, the traditional drink of the area. Sara is the most famous doogh in Iran. A traditional breakfast is cooked cow head.\n\nDue to the fertile soil northern Iran offers a great variety of food. In Rasht this includes Shami Rashti, Ardabij (Anar Bij) and Baghala ghatogh."
