        "text": "Northern belt of Iran, including the green provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan, which embrace the southern parts of the Caspian sea, is a very popular attraction among both domestic and foreign tourists.\n\nThe Caspian Sea was part of the Tethys Sea in the past, which connected the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. The sea is sometimes referred to as the largest lake in the world and sometimes as the smallest self-sufficient sea on the planet! Its welcoming waves and shore host people from Iran and abroad who come to the north to enjoy a swim or simply have a nice day on the beach.\n\nNorth’s Hyrcanian forests, which have existed since the Ice Age are known as a natural museum, and by entering each part, it is as if one has encountered a magical world, one resembling that of “Lost”, the great series. The fact that a significant part of the north of Iran is forest and mountains makes it possible to travel on mountain roads that pass through the forests and encounter enchanting landscapes. In the middle of these forests, sometimes one will be situated among the clouds and can watch the whole city under one’s feet from above!\n\nFrom the moment you enter the northern belt, you will go with the flow of its people’s life. Vibrant nightlife and the lively presence of people give meaning to the cities’ identity.\n\nOne of the most unique experiences you will have in the northern provinces is the food. You are blessed with hundreds of heavenly tastes in this land and maybe that is why Rasht, the capital city of Gilan province, has been registered as the creative city of food!\n\nAnother attraction of the northern provinces is its local markets and bazaars. Every day in one of the cities, you come across a local market or bazaar that is full of aromas, colours, and tastes, and you see men and women of different ages selling products in their local clothes. They bring their products to the market for sale and introduce them with their sweet northern dialect."
