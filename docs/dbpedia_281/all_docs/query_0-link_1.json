        "text": "City in Gilan province, Iran\n\nFor the administrative division of Gilan province, see Rasht County. For the valley in Tajikistan, see Rasht Valley.\n\nCity in Gilan, Iran\n\nRasht (Persian: رشت; [ɾæʃt] ⓘ)[a] is a city in the Central District of Rasht County, Gilan province, in Iran. Rasht serves as capital of the province, the county, and the district.[5] The city is also known as the \"City of Rain\" (شهر باران, Šahr-e Bārān) and, with a population of 679,995 in 2016,[3] is the most populous city of northern Iran.\n\nRasht is the largest city on Iran's Caspian Sea coast. Due to being between the coast and the mountains, the local environment is rainy with a humid subtropical climate. It also has temperate rainforest to its south, contrasting to the mostly arid Iran.\n\nIt is a major trade center between Caucasia, Russia, and Iran using the port of Bandar-e Anzali. Rasht is also a major tourist center with the resort of Masouleh in the adjacent mountains and the beaches of Caspian as some of the major attractions.\n\nHistorically, Rasht was a major transport and business center which connected Iran to Russia and the rest of Europe, and because of this was known as the \"Gate of Europe\". The city has a history that goes back to the 13th century but its modern history dates back to the Safavid era during which Rasht was a major silk trade center with numerous textile workshops. In 2015, this city joined the network of creative cities of the world as a creative gastronomy city under the supervision of UNESCO.\n\nSome of the famous neighbourhoods of Rasht include: Golsar, Safsar, Kordmahaleh and Khamiran.[6]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are multiple views about the city's name:[7][8]\n\nThe root of the city's name is the word resh (Persian: \"رش\") meaning very light rain. The word Varesh (fa: وارش) meaning \"rain\" in gilaki, indicates that this word is a combination of Va+ resh (fa:وا+رش)\n\nAnother point of view is that the correct pronunciation of the city's name is Resht (fa: رِشت) that is taken from the root Risidan (fa: ریسیدن) or Reshtan (fa: رشتن, both meaning spin)[9] and the reason for this name is the importance of the city in the production of silk threads.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: History of Gilan and Gīlān Province § History\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\n682: Rasht was first mentioned in Umayyad historical documents.\n\n1669: Stenka Razin, a Cossack warlord, plundered the city.\n\n1714: Rasht destroyed by earthquake.\n\n1722–1732: Occupation by the Russians due to the Russo-Persian War.\n\n1901: A major epidemic plague devastates the city.\n\n1917–1920: The Russian and British armed forces fight in the port city of Bandar-e Anzali and Rasht. The British retreat and the Russians occupy the area.\n\n1920–1921: The short-lived Gilan Soviet Socialist Republic was established with its capital in Rasht.\n\n1937: A revolt, sparked by the desire to collect a \"road tax\" from the Russians, was suppressed.\n\n1974: First university established in Rasht.\n\nRasht was first mentioned in Umayyad historical documents in 682 CE, but it is certainly older than this and appears on the Peutinger Map of late antiquity. It has seen the Sassanid era, the Rashidun conquest, the armies of Peter the Great and later Russian rulers, and British colonialism. The people of Rasht also played a major role in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran.\n\nRasht has, along with regions around Tabriz and Tehran, one of the earliest industry plants during the last quarter of the 19th century, prominently in fields such as fishing, caviar production, the Caspian sea oil pipeline construction and textiles. During the 20th century, until the mid-70s, Gilan and the Rasht region was the third-ranking industrial city in Iran by number of workers and per capital productivity. It lost its cultural and industrial status to a large extent after the 1970s.\n\nThe people of Rasht played a prominent role in instigation and radicalization of the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1905–1907). Rasht is the birthplace of Mīrzā Kūchak Khān, one of the leading figures of the Constitutional Revolution. His own movement in Gilan, which went by the name of Jangalis, represented a pro-modern and social democratic program for reformation of Muslim rituals and traditions. Mirza established the short-lived Persian Socialist Soviet Republic in 1920 after the defeat of the constitutional forces and in coalition with Iranian communists.\n\nThe republic had the support of the newly established Russian Red Army. The Soviet Government, after a turn of military and political strategy proposed by Trotsky, withdrew its support and the republic itself was tormented by the inner conflicts between the newly established Iranian Communist Party (1919) and the Jangalis and other factions. The republic was finally defeated by the Iranian army under the command of Reza Shah.\n\nThe first national library of Iran was established in Rasht under the Qajar dynasty. Nasim-e-Shomal, the first[citation needed] modern newspaper of Iran after the constitutional revolution, has been initially published in Rasht. First Public Library of Iran was built in Rasht City.[3] First Branch of the First Iranian Bank (Sepah Bank) was located in Rasht City.[10] First branch of 24/7 pharmacy (Karoon pharmacy) was built in Rasht City. First school for girls and first fire station in Iran were also built in Rasht City. The city of Rasht was the center of Gilan and the center of the first province of the country.\n\nDuring the Qajar period, along with economic development between Iran and Russia, Noghan trade and other products expanded. Thus, Rasht became the gateway to Europe in the 19th century. Grigoriy Melgunov [ru], a Russian orientalist and writer who visited Rasht at the end of 1860, wrote in his published notes that the city at that time had 5463 houses, 1021 shops, 22 mosques, 34 schools and 17 bathhouses, and a population of 27,314.[11] At that time, Rasht's political credibility was such that the Russian, British, and Ottoman governments had consulates in Rasht.[12]\n\nModern day\n\n[edit]\n\nRasht is turning into an industrialized town like most of the Iranian large cities and province capitals. Enjoying the Kadus International Hotel and hundreds of tourist attractions, Rasht receives thousands of foreign tourists annually, mostly from Austria, Germany, Netherlands, France, Australia, Japan and African countries like Senegal and Cameroon as well as countries from Oceania like Micronesia.\n\nRasht is known for its famous municipal building, located in the Square of Municipality, which was constructed circa 1900, and has been renovated each year. Due to the high amount of humidity in Rasht which damages and destroys the aged buildings, the native, older architectural texture of Rasht is gradually being replaced with the modern skyscrapers and apartments.\n\nThe culture of consumerism is prevalent among the people of Rasht as a cultural and urban center which is historically engaged in close commercial and political ties with the United Kingdom, Russia and France. Due to this background which makes the inhabitants much familiar with the industrial, cultural and political developments of the west, the finance and credit institutions are more willing to open representative offices and bureaus in Rasht and it has made the city a center of various banks and financial organizations.\n\nThere are many commercial centers, malls and financial institutions in Rasht including one branch of the Exports Development Bank of Iran which is an international bank dealing with the Iranian exports. The organizers and directors of national Iranian or non-Iranian banks afford to spend considerable amounts of budgets to construct attractive and modern buildings for their offices in Rasht.\n\nSince the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran, there have always been requests on behalf of Russian, Turkish and Azeri banks to open branches in Rasht and that is why the city is endowed as the \"gate of Europe\" in Iran. The head consulate of the Russian Federation government is located in Rasht and some of the other Caspian region countries are also keen to establish representative headquarters in Rasht alongside their embassies in Tehran.\n\nSome evidences are the University of Gilan which was constructed jointly by the governments of Iran and West Germany about 40 years ago, the building of IRIB representatives in Rasht which was constructed jointly by the Iranian and Belgian engineers.\n\nBigler-Beigi Pavilion, from Qajar dynasty\n\nMohtasham Park in Rasht\n\nRasht Municipality\n\nRasht Saravan Park\n\nGovernor Building of Guilan in Rasht\n\nFirst of Iran\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first branch of Bank Sepah and first Bank of Iran was established in Rasht in 1925[13]\n\nThe first girls' school in Iran was established in Rasht[14][15]\n\nThe first day & night pharmacy in Iran was established in Rasht[16]\n\nThe first sanatorium for the elderly and disabled in Iran was established in Rasht[17]\n\nThe first National Library of Iran was established in Rasht in 1920[14]\n\nThe first bus Iran arrived in Rasht[18]\n\nThe first city in which the sewage system was established\n\nThe first city in which the Russian, British, French and Ottoman governments opened their consulates and had political representatives.[14]\n\nThe first silk factory in Iran[19]\n\nThe first national hospital in Iran named Poursina Hospital[20]\n\nThe first classical theater in Iran[21]\n\nStreets and boulevards\n\n[edit]\n\nGolsar Street\n\nImam Ali Boulevard\n\nShahid Chamran Boulevard\n\nAyatollah Taleghani Boulevard\n\nResalat Street\n\nShohaday-e Gomnam Boulevard\n\nOstadsara Street\n\nEsteghamat Street\n\nDeylaman Boulevard\n\nMoallem Boulevard\n\nImam Khomeini Boulevard\n\nValiasr Street\n\nEnghelab Street\n\nAzadi Street\n\nAzadegan Boulevard\n\nShahid Ansari Street\n\nFarhang Street\n\nParastar Boulevard\n\nBastani Shoaar Street\n\nAfakhra Street\n\nPasdaran Street\n\n22 Bahman Boulevard\n\nAlamolhoda Street\n\nSaadi Street\n\nTohid Street\n\nNavab Street\n\nGilan Boulevard\n\nGholipour Boulevard\n\nHabibzadeh Boulevard\n\nAnsari Boulevard\n\nSuleman Darab Boulevard\n\nTakhti Street\n\nBisotun Street\n\nGolsar Street\n\nGolsar Street\n\nGilan Street\n\nAnsari Street\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nRasht has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa, Trewartha: Cf).

They spend the leisure times going to cinemas, art exhibitions, music concerts and international book fairs that are being held in the city most of times in a year. Also the municipality kicks off sports, cultural or IT-related competitions to involve the youth in healthy and constructive activities. The most beloved competition is the annual blogging competition which awards the top young bloggers each year.\n\nRasht has played a major role in Iranian history. It was Iran's gateway to Russia and Europe; therefore it was influenced by western architecture. Iran's first public library was built here and it was the first city in Iran where girls were allowed to go to school.\n\nIranian cities of Isfahan and Rasht were accepted to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network on December 11, 2015.

Zeitoun Parvardeh is a kind of delicacy prepared from olives and pomegranates; it is a popular seasoning in the city.[38]\n\nRose de Rescht\n\n[edit]\n\nRosa 'de Rescht', like many old garden roses, presents an interesting historical background story. This cultivar, originating in Iran, was reported at the end of 19th century in England, but it was then forgotten. It was rediscovered near the Iranian provincial capital of Rascht by Miss Nancy Lindsay in 1945, and was brought back to the United Kingdom, where it was re-introduced around 1950. Today it is shown in the Victorian Class, winning many trophies.[39]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThe people of Rasht have always been regular fans of football which is the beloved sport in the city.

Sardar Jangal Stadium is the city's second stadium.\n\nFollowing football, wrestling, judo and weightlifting are the most popular sports of youth in Rasht and that is due to the enchanting appearance of Iranian wrestlers and weightlifters in the international competitions like Olympics. The outstanding figure of world weightlifting and the two-time olympics Gold medal winner Hossein Rezazadeh is a main inspirer of Rasht youth to try Weightlifting as their professional job. Asghar Ebrahimi who was the squad captain of Iranian weightlifting team at the 2008 Olympics is from Rasht and a successful example of those youth from Rasht who tried this national field of sport after Hossein Rezazadeh.\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversity of Gilan\n\nGilan university of medical sciences\n\nIslamic Azad University of Rasht\n\nJaber ebn Hayyan Institute of Higher Education\n\nPayame Noor University\n\nInstitute of Higher Education for Academic Jihad of Rasht\n\nGuilan Technical & Vocational Training Organization[40]\n\nGilan Advanced Skills Training Center[41]\n\nRasht Technical and Vocational Institute[42]\n\nGuilan University of Applied and Scientific Technology[43]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThis city is greatly important based on its geographical situation (locating on the central plain and its large width, fertile lands and soil, being the most important region of the province and Iran in terms of rice cultivation), communicative situation (locating among Tehran–Qazvin-Anzali-Astara roads, in one hand, and the main road from Gilan to Mazandaran and the east of Gilan, on the other hand), political–administrative situation (situating as the capital city of Gilan province) and economic development, towns expansion and industrial factories and the following increase in the agricultural-commercial activities and in the number of science and technology centers.\n\nThe most residents of this city are active in service, trading and industrial jobs and paddy is the main activities of the villagers in this region.[44][45][46] Rasht has long been one of the most prominent customs cities in Iran.
