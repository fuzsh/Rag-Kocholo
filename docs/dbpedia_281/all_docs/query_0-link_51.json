        "text": "Rasht is the capital of Gilan Province. It is one of the most beautiful cities in Iran. This city is the largest and most populous city on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. The seashore is about 25 kilometers from the city. If you are planning to travel to this vibrant city, one of the places you should visit is Mohtasham Garden.\n\nAlso known as the “City Park,” Mohtasham Garden holds the distinction of being the oldest park in Rasht. Situated on Hafez Street, in the southern part of the city, the park is located next to the picturesque Gohar River, which was once a popular spot for fishing. Today, Mohtasham Garden serves as the main park and major recreational center for residents and visitors alike. This beautiful park was constructed during the Qajar period (1794-1925).\n\nHistory\n\nThe park has its roots in the Qajar dynasty. Akbar Khan Biglarbegi, who was one of the wealthiest and most prominent individuals in Iran during Nasser al-Din Shah’s reign, initiated the primary project for the park. The small and delicate saplings that were planted at that time have now grown into magnificent trees. Additionally, the interior of the garden was paved, and a splendid summer mansion was constructed in the center, which was named Kolah Farangi Mansion. Akbar Khan, who passed away in 1901, was responsible for overseeing the work carried out by his people.\n\nFollowing the death of Akbar Khan, his daughter inherited the garden and the summer mansion. She was married to her cousin, Sadeq Khan Akbar Mohtasham al-Mulk, and the garden was subsequently renamed Mohtasham Garden. However, during the Pahlavi era (1925-1979 CE), the government claimed the garden in exchange for outstanding tax debts. Since then, the garden has transformed into the City Park of Rasht, and has remained open to the public, inviting everyone to enjoy its beauty and tranquility.\n\nIn the past, this park was so vast that, without a guide, one could easily get lost in it. However, with the expansion of Rasht and the need for new streets, the park gradually had to be reduced in size. After the Islamic Revolution of Iran, an amusement park and the Gilan governor’s office were constructed within the park, further reducing the available interior space.\n\nKolah Farangi Mansion\n\nThe Kolah Farangi Mansion is one of the most beautiful and captivating features of this garden, dating back to the Qajar period. It is a popular tourist attraction in Rasht, thanks to its stunning views and unique architecture. Despite being a four-story building, it appears as a three-story structure from the outside. The first and second floors each contain two rooms, while the upper floor boasts a large octagonal room with windows on all sides. These windows not only offer breathtaking views but also provide ample lighting and ventilation during hot seasons.\n\nBrick and wood were the primary materials used in the construction of this impressive summer building, which boasts a 360-degree balcony offering breathtaking views from every angle.\n\nOriginally designed as a residence for government officials and dignitaries, the Kolah Farangi Mansion has witnessed a diverse range of uses throughout history. It has served as a chess house, a restaurant, and even a traditional arts training center. This versatile edifice remains a testament to the rich heritage and adaptive nature of architectural marvels.\n\nDespite its unassuming simplicity, the building’s embellishments elevate its magnificence and allure to astonishing heights. The delicate wooden lion heads, meticulously carved columns, and breathtaking balcony railings are but a glimpse into the plethora of exquisite details that bedeck this time-honored edifice. Each ornate element harmoniously contributes to the overall splendor and unrivaled beauty of this historic architectural gem.\n\nWhere recreation and beauty meet\n\nMohtasham Garden, Rasht’s premier park, encompasses all the quintessential features one would anticipate in a grand park. Here, you can delight in a plethora of amenities designed to cater to diverse preferences. From myriad sports fields and playgrounds tailored for both children and teenagers, to immaculate restrooms, a serene prayer hall, wooden seating enclaves, public sports equipment, and captivating fountains, the park leaves no stone unturned in providing an all-encompassing recreational experience. With its wealth of facilities and enticing attractions, Mohtasham Garden is an undeniable hub of enjoyment and enchantment, guaranteed to bestow upon visitors unforgettable moments.\n\nA city of rain and wonder\n\nSituated in the heart of Rasht, this remarkable park welcomes visitors all year round, providing an opportunity to relish the distinct allure of each passing season. However, it is worth noting that Rasht has earned the nickname “Rain City” due to its frequent rainfall, especially during the colder months. To ensure a pleasant and gratifying visit, we highly recommend checking the weather forecast in advance. This way, you can equip yourself with suitable attire and prepare for a comfortable and delightful experience.\n\nRasht presents a captivating array of experiences that are bound to delight you in every way. From awe-inspiring natural landscapes to captivating historical sites, the city has it all. And let’s not forget about the irresistible gastronomy that Rasht proudly offers.\n\nAdditionally, within close proximity, you’ll find enchanting attractions like Shahrdari Square, Rasht Grand Bazaar, and the Gilan Rural Heritage Museum, each offering its own unique charm and cultural significance."
