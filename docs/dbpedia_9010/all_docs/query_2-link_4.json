For the non-canon Marine, see Drake (Non-Canon).\n\n\"Red Flag\" X Drake (pronounced as \"Diez Drake\") is the captain of the Marine Secret Special Unit SWORD. In order to go undercover as a pirate, he publicly defected from his position as rear admiral[8] and founded the Drake Pirates.[2][1] He is one of twelve pirates referred to as the \"Worst Generation\",[13] and before the two-year timeskip had a bounty of 222,000,000.[1]\n\nDrake is the son of the Marine-turned-pirate Diez Barrels, and was affiliated with the Barrels Pirates until he defected to the Marines. As a young adult, he was called Dory.[6][14]\n\nIn Drake's endeavor as an undercover spy,[2] he and his crew became subordinate to the Beasts Pirates, led by Kaidou of the Four Emperors, over the two-year timeskip.[3] Drake served as one of the crew's Shinuchi, specifically one of strongest six called Tobiroppo.[4] His treachery was eventually uncovered, however, leading him to ally himself with the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance.[5]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nDrake is a tall, lean, and muscular man who wears what appears to be a combination of a white-plumed cocked hat with his crew's Jolly Roger on the side and a domino mask over his eyes. Underneath this headgear, Drake's hair is reddish brown, with brush-like sideburns. On his broad chin he has an \"X\" (not confirmed to be either a scar or tattoo) and on his chest and upper body he also has another large \"X\". The \"X's\", as well as that in his name, represents the Roman Numeral X for 10, not the English letter. When seen from above, his bicorne greatly resembles the head of a Pterodactyl.\n\nHe wears armor on his relatively thin legs and arms consisting of knee-high boots and gloves that go up past his elbows, respectively. The openings to both the gloves and the boots are also secured by the armor, which is rounded for the gloves and a sharp maple leaf pattern for the boots at the front of his knees. On the rest of his body, he wears leather pants and a leather shirt. A belt with a large ornately designed circular belt buckle secures Drake's pants as well as his sword and axe to his waist. He also wears a black cape, which, from the inside, is crimson-colored, with a white fur lining around the neck.[1]\n\nAfter the Summit War, he is seen wearing a scarf that is tied around his neck when he appeared on a winter island that was apparently under the protection of Kaidou.[15]\n\nIn SBS Volume 64, Oda drew the Supernovas as children. Drake is shown wearing a small tattered Marine uniform, showing that he aspired to become a Marine since he was very young. He had a rounder face, shorter hair, and a wooden sword at his side. He did not have the \"X\" on his chin yet. He appears to have been a playful and cheerful boy, as opposed to the stern and serious man he grew up to be.[16]\n\nAs a young adult, Drake wore a tattered, bloodied shirt with pants and boots on the snowy Minion Island while with the Barrels Pirates,[17] though later on during a supposed escape, he managed to acquire a somewhat tattered, thick winter coat with a hood as well as a pair of dark gloves.[6] Due to the mental and physical abuse he suffered from his father, he was undersized for his age and easily mistaken as a child by the Donquixote Pirates.[14]\n\nAfter the timeskip, Drake no longer has his bicorne, exposing his now light orange hair spiked into a fauxhawk. In place of his bicorne, he now has a black headband with an eyehole cut out of it and his crew's Jolly Roger next to the hole. The headband is slanted so it goes over his left eye, and a thin piece of cloth from it, presumably cut from the hole, is fitted over his right eye.[18]\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain Series[]\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nOther[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nIn his childhood, Drake was a Marine enthusiast and deeply admired his father, Diez Barrels, who served the organization as an officer. When Barrels turned to piracy, Drake still thought of his father as a good man and kept following him.[14]\n\nAs a young man thirteen years ago, Drake appeared to be the reluctant, submissive type, obeying his father despite the abusive treatment he was given. Barrels once stated that despite his strength, Drake was a coward and rarely contributed to his crew's operations. Indeed, by that point, Drake ran away when the opportunity presented itself, displaying no loyalty to his family.[6] In the present, Drake seemingly has not regretted this decision, holding no grudge towards the perpetrators of his father's death.[3]\n\nIn spite of the horrible treatment his father gave him, Drake still remains loyal to the Marines, putting his life at risk in order to infiltrate the crew of one of the Four Emperors. Even when presented with the threat of torture, Drake stated that he would rather die than reveal his true allegiance, only deciding to keep fighting because he still had a mission to accomplish. Drake is flexible with his beliefs of Justice as he is not picky about potential allies in criminals and outlaws, going as far as request to join forces with Monkey D. Luffy, an enemy of the World Government, just because of the Straw Hat's friendship with Koby, Drake's subordinate.[5] An honorable man, Drake has declared that he intends to repay Luffy for accepting him as an ally in a time of need.[19]\n\nCurrently, Drake displays a stern, dead-serious disposition at all times. Patient and observant, he appears to be a pirate who avoids needless violence, aware that such a thing would attract unwanted attention. In fact, he may even intervene in fights where he is not involved at all, doing so in the middle of confrontation between Killer and Urouge in an attempt to pacify both of his fellow Super Rookies.[1] However, when a situation calls for violence, Drake reveals a surprisingly ruthless and bloodthirsty streak. Trafalgar Law once implied that Drake had killed a significant amount of people in his career, reinforcing the notion that the former rear admiral is actually not opposed to conflict at all.[1] Later, Drake fearlessly attacked a Pacifista head-on, employing a brutal biting attack in his Zoan form. Drake is bold enough to even challenge a subordinate of the Four Emperors, knowing full well that such an action would put him in the crosshairs of the Emperor himself.[15]\n\nAs one of the Tobiroppo, Drake is very much mission-oriented, always prioritizing the job assigned to him, although he might think his presence in certain tasks may be overkill, like assassinating the owner of a small noodle shop.[4] This professionalism and dutifulness also extend to his job as a Marine spy, reporting everything of note that he ends up witnessing in his cover.[2] Despite holding a high position in the Beasts Pirates, Drake self-admittedly has no interest in raising further in the ranks, unlike some of his fellow Tobiroppo.[4]\n\nIn spite of his generally serious attitude, Drake is known to sometimes lose his composure in certain situations. In particular, naked women easily fluster him to the point of fainting at the sight of one, making him wary of entering places like bathhouses. Nevertheless, he still denies this weakness even if it's obviously the case.[20]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nDiez Barrels[]\n\nBarrels was Drake's father, and when he was a Marine Officer, Drake wanted to become just like him. However, when Barrels became a pirate, he was known to physically abuse his son. Drake remained with his father as he continued to see the past good of the man, but his loyalty started to waver. When Doflamingo attacked Barrels and his crew with the Birdcage, Drake fled and left them behind.[14] Thirteen years later, Drake was seen acknowledging Doflamingo as his father's killer, but stated that he held no grudge.[3]\n\nBarrels Pirates[]\n\n13 years ago, he was a member of the Barrels Pirates. However, he was barely (if at all) loyal to the crew, considered \"always a no show\", and he simply ran for his own life instead of saving anyone when Doflamingo attacked.[17][6]\n\nMarines[]\n\nIt appeared that as a child, he hoped to be a Marine,[16] possibly because of his father's previous affiliation with them. Thirteen years ago, Drake fled the Barrels Pirates and was saved by the Marines.[6]\n\nAt some point in the past, he joined the Marines and became a rear admiral,[8] but to public knowledge, he quit to become a pirate. He seemed to be aware of the Pacifista project, but had only recently learned of its completion while fighting one of them at Sabaody Archipelago.[8]\n\nIn secret, he is still a member of the Marines, serving as the captain of the special forces unit SWORD.[2] His steadfast loyalty to the organization is that he would choose death over confession to the enemies, even if it means enduring torture, and he intends to return to the Marines in full eventually, which he did as he is recovering in the Marine GS General Hospital.[5]\n\nKoby[]\n\nThey appear to have a trusted professional relationship due to Koby being one of the few people who is aware that Drake's return to piracy was a ruse and he is still affiliated with the Marines as a commanding officer of the SWORD unit.[2] He also trusts Koby's views about Luffy as a benevolent pirate, as Drake requested to join Luffy's alliance after remembering Koby praising Luffy, believing that any remaining hope for his mission to defeat the Beasts Pirates lies in cooperation with the Straw Hat captain.[5]\n\nWorld Government[]\n\nDuring his time with the Marines, Drake is loyal to the World Government. He did his best to follow the government's orders, but he has come to question them by noting the contradictions in their policies. His conversation with his fellow officer Koby demonstrates this by informing his colleague that CP0 is conducting negotiations with pirates in Wano Country despite their own laws forbidding the practice. Drake states he is fearful of the government's collusion with criminals and he was shocked that he could not think properly.[2]\n\nAt Onigashima, Drake entered in direct conflict with CP0 agents, who were aware of his position at SWORD. They attempted to assassinate him, leading Drake to even team up with Apoo (who he otherwise despises) to fight them off.\n\nSengoku[]\n\nSengoku did not just take care of Corazon like a father, but also did the same for Drake after he fled his father's crew.[12]\n\nEnemies[]\n\nBeasts Pirates[]\n\nPrior to the timeskip, Drake seemed to be interested in meeting Kaidou, having willingly provoked his subordinates in the New World in order to gain the Emperor's attention. Proving his loyalty, Drake squashed a rebellion led by Caribou (who was posing as Gaburu) on an island affiliated with the Emperor and destroyed Amigasa Village, defeating the five samurai who protected the community.[21] However, as Drake remained in secret a member of the Marines, he was reporting Kaidou's on-goings to his subordinates outside of Wano and secretly helping the rebels.[2]\n\nDuring the Fire Festival, Queen and Who's-Who wanted to kill him after learning that he was the one who helped free Law from prison. While his true allegiance was not exposed, his actions were enough to make him an enemy of the Beasts Pirates.\n\nScratchmen Apoo[]\n\nDrake seemingly hates Scratchmen Apoo, a fellow member of the Worst Generation and looked forward to crushing him for personal reasons. Apoo similarly holds some disdain for Drake, based on his comments about the latter's alliance with Luffy.\n\nWhen Apoo later wanted to pursue Drake into forming an alliance with him to take down the victor of the war, Drake openly displayed his distrust in Apoo's proposal. When they were both attacked by members of the CP0, they reluctantly formed a temporary teamup to take on the agents, but not before bickering at each other.\n\nBasil Hawkins[]\n\nDrake and Hawkins worked together at the Flower Capital during certain points of the Wano Country Arc. When Drake was sent to the capital alongside Page One to deal with Sangoro, Hawkins accompanied him due to having his own target to hunt as well. They also both participated in the rebellion crackdown and Yasuie's execution, both organized by Orochi. Because of his status as a mole, Drake was seemingly interested in the possibility of Hawkins defecting from the Beasts Pirates due to his forced recruitment by Kaidou, but the Magician shot down the idea.\n\nHawkins already suspected Drake for releasing Law from captivity at the Flower Capital and joined Who's-Who and Queen in questioning the undercover Marine, citing that there was no other likely candidate for the deed. From that point on, they became enemies.\n\nAfter the Raid on Onigashima, both were heavily injured and Hawkins stumbled to Drake questioning him on being apart of the Marines, with Drake refusing to answer. Hawkins then revealed to Drake that the man who he divined as having a one percent chance of survival was him all along, and proceeded to collapse from his injuries.[22]\n\nOther[]\n\nStraw Hat Pirates[]\n\nWhile working for the Beasts Pirates, Drake was an active enemy of the Straw Hat Pirates throughout the Wano Country Arc. However, with his cover blown during the raid on Onigashima, Drake was left with no choice but to join forces with Luffy and his friends in order to accomplish his duty. During the raid, he planned on repaying Luffy for his trust and accepting him into the alliance once the raid was over.\n\nWhile Luffy had no qualms in letting Drake assist them, Roronoa Zoro, Franky and Jinbe all held their reservations towards the Marine, mostly because he kept his reasons for defecting unclear and were suspicious of his true affiliations.\n\nRoronoa Zoro[]\n\nAmong the Straw Hats, Zoro was the one who distrusted Drake the most when the latter sought their alliance, briefly clashing with him while questioning his true motives and allegiance. Zoro, however, accepted to team up with Drake once Apoo started summoning Numbers and Queen began shooting at them. Once Apoo was dealt with and Zoro headed off to the Skull Dome's rooftop, he praised Drake for helping hold the fort at the Live Floor and betting on the alliance's win.\n\nSanji[]\n\nBecause of Sanji's transgression against the Kyoshiro Family, Drake was one of two people sent to punish him.[4] After Page One failed to kill Sanji, Drake continued with his mission to hunt down Sanji and was relentless in attacking him at Rasetsu Town. Drake recognized Sanji as O-Soba Mask and brought up on how he heard that Sanji is from the Vinsmoke Family, much to the latter's irritation.[23]\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo[]\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo was the one responsible for the deaths of his father and his crew back on Minion Island. However, Drake never held a grudge against the Ex-Warlord for this due to having lost all respect for his father.\n\nAbilities and Powers[]\n\nAs captain of the Marine Headquarters' secret special force, SWORD and the Drake Pirates, Drake has great authority over his subordinates.[2][1] Even during his youth, he was the strongest member of the Barrels Pirates,[6] and he later achieved the rank of Rear Admiral in the Marines, prior to his public defection. He is a member of the Worst Generation that survived one of the seven harsh and dangerous routes through Paradise, the first half of the Grand Line, earning a bounty of 222,000,000 before entering the New World.[13] Despite his attack on a favorite island of the Emperor Kaidou,[15] Drake survived the experience and made a greater name for himself.[24] At some point during the two-year timeskip, he became one of the Tobiroppo, the six strongest Shinuchi of the Beasts Pirates, holding a high position in the crew with authority over the lower-ranking members, before his treason was exposed and he left the crew.[5]\n\nDrake is an extremely formidable combatant; he stopped a fight between two other Supernovas with just one move,[1] effortlessly defeated a Super Rookie,[21] and was one of the few pirates on the Sabaody Archipelago capable of injuring a Pacifista without outside help.[25] According to Kouzuki Sukiyaki, Drake single-handedly defeated the five samurai who guarded Amigasa Village, and destroyed the town.[7] During the raid on Onigashima, Drake defeated the drunken ancient giant, Juki, with a single attack,[5] and despite having lost his battle against CP0, his sheer toughness was still praised by Guernica.[26]\n\nWhile a powerful person in his own right, he has a surprising weakness in that he becomes faint at the sight of a naked female.[20]\n\nPhysical Abilities[]\n\nDrake has immense strength; he blocked simultaneous blows from Urouge and Killer, fellow members of the Worst Generation, with little effort,[1] and knocked a Pacifista into a building with a mere two hits.[27] He has vast reserves of stamina and a great tolerance for pain, as he exhibited little discomfort after having a laser pierce through his abdomen,[28] remained conscious (though heavily wounded) after being kicked by Kizaru into a building at the speed of light,[29] and he quickly recovered after being defeated by CPO, retaining enough strength to impale an agent with his sword.[30] Drake also managed to survived being stab in the neck for some time.\n\nTactical Skills[]\n\nAdditionally, Drake is quite intelligent, interrupting Killer and Urouge's battle because he knew that it would only draw more unwanted attention,[1] and possesses a deep understanding of the workings of the World Government, being aware of the Pacifista and Vegapunk.[8] He successfully went undercover as a pirate captain and founded his own crew for an unknown purpose. After he left the Beasts Pirates, Drake quickly took advantage of his what he had previously heard about Luffy from Koby in order to convince him that he was on his side.\n\nSwordsmanship and Axemanship[]\n\nDrake dual wields both a rapier and a four-bladed axe and is extremely skilled in wielding them simultaneously.[1]\n\nTechniques[]\n\nX Calibur (X（エクス）狩場（カリバー）, Ekusu Karibā?, literally meaning \"X Hunting Ground\"): From above, Drake swings his sword to his right and his axe to his left, striking down upon an enemy with both weapons simultaneously. The attack was first seen used against an inebriated Juki, successfully knocking out the artificial ancient giant. Drake was in his allosaurus-hybrid form while performing the attack, likely enhancing its power.[5][31] The attack's name is a nod to the famous sword Excalibur from Arthurian legend, with the name's kanji representing a pun: 狩場 (\"hunting ground\") would normally be read as kariba, matching the Japanese pronunciation of \"-calibur\" (カリバー, karibā?), with the preceding \"X\" a play on Drake's name.\n\nDevil Fruit[]\n\nFurther information: Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Allosaurus\n\nDrake ate the Ryu Ryu no Mi, Model: Allosaurus, an Ancient Zoan-type Devil Fruit[8] that allows him to transform into a full allosaurus and a human-allosaurus hybrid at will.[4]\n\nAs a carnivorous Zoan, Drake gains a significant enhancement to his physical abilities in close combat. He also gains advantageous bodily characteristics, including extremely hard and sharp teeth and powerful jaws that are strong enough to bite through the stronger-than-steel body of a Pacifista, causing it to bleed. His great reptilian tail is also a powerful weapon, capable of slamming people with great force.[23] He also gains sharp claws on his feet, augmenting his kicks.\n\nHaki[]\n\nMain article: Haki\n\nBusoshoku Haki[]\n\nDrake has shown that he is capable of using Busoshoku Haki when he easily defeated Caribou, a Logia user.[21] He is also capable of imbuing his weapons with Busoshoku Haki to augment the power of his attacks.[32]\n\nKenbunshoku Haki[]\n\nDrake possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki.[12]\n\nHistory[]\n\nPast[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nDrake was born to Diez Barrels and an unknown woman. He aspired to be like his father and join the Marines. However, Barrels later became a pirate, and started physically abusing his son. However, Drake remained with his father as he continued to see the past good of the man.[14]\n\nThirteen years ago, Drake was on Minion Island with the Barrels Pirates waiting for a trade deal of 5,000,000,000 in exchange for the Ope Ope no Mi. During that time, he was said to be a \"brat\" by Barrels. While on Minion Island, he narrowly missed being captured by Donquixote Doflamingo's Birdcage and ran away from it instead of helping the pirates from Barrels' crew escape.[6] He was later found and taken in by the Marines, who reported it.[33]\n\nMarine and Piracy[]\n\nAfter the incident on Minion Island, Drake became a Marine and rose to the rank of Rear Admiral.[8] He then became part of the secret Marine organization SWORD, becoming its captain afterwards. Four years before the current storyline, Drake and other Marines accompanied Kizaru to Egghead to deal with an episode involving Vegapunk and a certain pirate.[34]\n\nAt some point Drake went undercover as a pirate,[2] with his cover story being that he defected from the Marines to form a pirate crew, the Drake Pirates.[1] Drake was committed to his undercover role, and used his past experience to further his Piracy career, to the point that his cover story became well known and he became infamous enough to earn a bounty of 222,000,000. His crew traveled through the Grand Line and eventually would make it to Sabaody Archipelago.\n\nSummit War Saga[]\n\nSabaody Archipelago Arc[]\n\nAfter a long voyage following one of the Log Pose routes of the Grand Line, Drake and his crew came to the Sabaody Archipelago to prepare themselves for the New World. While there, he noticed two other pirates, Urouge and Killer, fighting each other. Knowing full well what would happen if they caused too much of a scene, Drake stopped their battle and told them to hold it off until they reach the New World. The two fortunately complied with Drake's request. As Drake and his crew walked away from the two pirates, he was momentarily egged on by Trafalgar Law to fight. However, Drake was not swayed by the latter's behavior.[1]\n\nAs Drake continued with the rest of his crew around Sabaody, he noticed that there were very few Marines on the mangrove. This puzzled Drake a bit since Sabaody was right next to the Marine Headquarters. However, it did not take long for Drake to figure things out as he received a newspaper with late-breaking news while traversing Grove 24. Written on it, as he told the rest of his crew, was news that Portgas D. Ace, the recently captured second division commander of Whitebeard's crew, was sentenced to public execution. Knowing that Whitebeard would definitely retaliate, Drake figured that the Marines would definitely need all the manpower they could get for the battle that would come, hence the shortage of Marines in the mangrove. All these disturbed Drake as he was wondering if the World Government and the Marines were asking for war.[35]\n\nWhen the news of Monkey D. Luffy's attack of a World Noble spread over the archipelago, Drake ordered his men to prepare the ship for departure immediately, but he also stated an interest as to which of the three admirals would be sent to deal with the situation.[36] After Admiral Kizaru arrived on the island, Drake was forced to attack him to save fellow Supernovas Basil Hawkins and Urouge in the midst of dealing with him and one of several Pacifistas invading the island.[37] After Scratchmen Apoo made his surprise attack, he was quickly dispatched by Kizaru, who then took down Drake and Hawkins with little effort.[38]\n\nMarineford Arc[]\n\nDespite the confrontation with Kizaru, Drake and his crew managed to escape capture. He later watched the war at Marineford televised at Sabaody.[39] At the end of the war, the Drake Pirates approached Marineford and watched it to its conclusion from a safe distance on their ship while listening to Marine war intel through a Black Den Den Mushi. Drake commented that, with the conclusion of the war, the Marines would need to change.[40]\n\nPost-War Arc[]\n\nDrake and his crew successfully made it into the New World. They stopped at a winter island and encountered \"Iron Boy\" Scotch, a subordinate of Kaidou. Scotch told Drake that the island is a favorite of the Emperor and is under his control. Drake questioned that if he were to attack Scotch, then he would get the attention of Kaidou, in which Scotch replied \"yes\". With this confirmed, Drake gladly activated his Devil Fruit and began his attack.[15]\n\nDuring the Timeskip[]\n\nSometime during the two-year timeskip, Drake joined Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates[41] and became one of the crew's Shinuchi and one of the Tobiroppo. He assisted in the destruction of Amigasa Village at Wano Country.[7]\n\nDressrosa Saga[]\n\nCaribou's Kehihihihi in the New World[]\n\nAfter Caribou (who was posing as Gaburu) defeated Scotch and destroyed a factory on the same winter island under Kaidou's control, Drake (in dinosaur form) appeared and attacked him, his crew, and Gaburu's revolutionaries while they were celebrating. After defeating Caribou, Drake then dragged him away.[21] After Caribou received a meat pie from Gaburu's grandmother, Drake took Caribou away on his ship.[42]\n\nDressrosa Arc[]\n\nAfter Doflamingo's defeat, Drake read about Luffy and Law's victory from a newspaper. He acknowledged that Doflamingo killed his father but did not hold a grudge.[3]\n\nWano Country Saga[]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nOne Piece: Stampede[]\n\nDrake and his crew attended the Pirates Festival on Delta Island. He participated in the main event, the Treasure Race, safely sailing up the Knock Up Stream and landing on the central Treasure Island, where all the pirates raced for Gol D. Roger's treasure, all the while battling other Worst Generation members. When Buggy ended up exposing himself after snatching the treasure, Drake and his crew chased after the Warlord. However, the Treasure Race was cut short, when someone threw a galleon at the island, destroying it, and sending everything plummeting back to the surface. When Drake realized that the one who did this was Douglas Bullet, he was quite surprised. In the end, he gave into Bullet's taunting, and together with the other Worst Generation members (except for Zoro and Law) attacked the Demon Heir. At first the Worst Generation pirates managed to deal a few good blows on the veteran, but when the opponent revealed his Gasha Gasha no Mi powers, the battle quickly ended in their defeat.\n\nLater, after Bullet was defeated, his crew along with the other Worst Generation pirates and several other crews attempted to breakthrough the Marines encirclement surrounding the island. They were able to successfully escape thanks to Sabo and Ann creating a blazing barrier to protect them.[43]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nWano Country Arc[]\n\nAt the Flower Capital, Drake and Page One were sent to punish a soba shop owner for beating up some of Kyoshiro's men. They were accompanied by Hawkins as well.[4]\n\nThe next day, Drake and Hawkins led a group to raid a bathhouse and look for people with the Kouzuki Family's crescent moon symbol on their ankles. Drake came into the bathhouse after hearing about Sanji's presence. Upon seeing Sanji in his Raid Suit, Hawkins and Drake recognized him as Stealth Black.[20] After Sanji and his group escaped the bathhouse, Drake and Hawkins continued with their patrol in the capital.[44]\n\nDrake and Hawkins later stood guard at the prison in the Rasetsu District where Shimotsuki Yasuie was imprisoned and scheduled to be executed. As crowds of people gathered, Drake commented that all the attention and commotion from Komurasaki's funeral shifted to the execution.[45] When Shogun Kurozumi Orochi tried to kill Toko after executing Yasuie, Drake and Hawkins witnessed Roronoa Zoro and Sanji saving the girl.[46] With Sanji present, Drake transformed into his Zoan form and proceeded to attack him.[47] After Sanji handed Toko to Usopp, Drake slammed Sanji into the ground with his tail when the chef tried to strike back. Drake continued with his attack with Sanji evading and dashing off.[23]\n\nAfter Hawkins captured Law, Drake secretly helped Law subdue Hawkins and let him escape.[48][49] Later, in an abandoned residence somewhere on the outskirts of Ebisu, Drake spoke with Koby via Den Den Mushi in secret and informed him of the recent events in Wano such as Kaidou and Big Mom's alliance and CP0's arrival.[2]\n\nOn the day of the Fire Festival, Drake arrived at Onigashima with the rest of the Tobiroppo.[50] They then sat down to wait to meet with Kaidou and bickered amongst themselves.[51] When Kaidou arrived, he gave them the mission of finding his son Yamato, saying he would let them battle one of the All-Stars for their position if they succeeded.[52]\n\nAs the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance waged war in Onigashima, Drake was speaking with Hawkins when Who's-Who approached them. Who's-Who asked Drake to join him in killing Queen. Though he had no interest in taking part of their feud, Drake followed Who's-Who anyway. He was then lured into an ambush, where Who's-Who and Queen attacked him. They accused Drake of treachery and questioned him, but an explosion enabled Drake to flee.\n\nAfter weighing his options, he attacked one of the Numbers. Having become an enemy of the Beasts Pirates, Drake requested Luffy to let him join the Alliance's side.[5] Zoro, Franky, and Jinbe did not trust him, and Zoro clashed with Drake. They finally joined forces when Apoo and Queen entered the fray. Drake was alarmed when Queen used Excite Bullets against the rebels[53] and unleashed the Ice Oni virus.[54]\n\nThe virus spread, affecting both ally and foe alike. Queen tossed the only vial containing the antidote to Apoo and gave everyone the challenge to take the cure from him. As Apoo fled from his pursuers, Drake and Zoro attacked him together.[55] Drake continued clashing with Apoo until Zoro struck down the latter and grabbed the antidote vial.[56] After Chopper was given the antidote vial, Apoo recovered and tried to retrieve the vial, but Drake stopped him. He then told Zoro to go to the roof while he stayed to guard Chopper and the mass-production of the antidote.[57]\n\nDrake and Hyougoro continued fighting Apoo and the other Beasts Pirates, preventing them from reaching Chopper.[58][59] Drake was impressed by Hyougoro's strength after the yakuza singlehandedly defeated most of the Orochi Oniwabanshu and Mimawarigumi. Once Chopper had released the Chopperphage and cured the infected, he transformed into his Monster Point and slapped Queen, while exclaiming that he was not a \"tanuki\". Drake inwardly apologized for having called him such.[60]\n\nDrake later retreated into the Cave Chamber with Apoo and three Numbers. Apoo proposed another alliance to form with Drake to finish off the war's victor and come out victorious after the raid, to which Drake skeptically questioned Apoo's honesty and loyalty.[61] Drake rejected the proposal and, having figured out the workings of Apoo's Devil Fruit ability, engaged him in battle. Their skirmish, however, was interrupted by Yamato, who barged into the chamber and attacked Drake, unaware that he had renounced his Tobiroppo title. With Apoo showing interest in teaming up with Yamato, Drake followed after them.[62]\n\nHaving pursued Yamato and Apoo into the second floor of the castle's basement, Drake witnessed the Kazenbo falling through the floor and burning several Beasts Pirates and the CP0 agents Guernica and Maha who were chasing after Nico Robin and Brook. Guernica struck Apoo down for photographing them and revealed to Drake that they had figured out his identity as an undercover Marine. Just as they were about to silence him, Apoo, who had survived his prior assassination attempt, managed to counter the attack meant for Drake. The two Worst Generation pirates then started bickering, but ultimately decided to join forces against the government agents.[63]\n\nDespite holding them back for a while, Drake was defeated alongside Zanki after Apoo fled.[26] After Izou and Maha defeated each other, Drake overheard Guernica receive orders to kill Luffy. Refusing to let that happen, Drake stood back up[64] and stabbed Guernica from behind; however, the agent survived and stabbed Drake in the neck with Shigan.[30]\n\nAfter Kaidou had been defeated and Onigashima had landed, Drake was found by Hawkins and questioned if he was a Marine, but Drake refused to answer. As Hawkins slumped against a column, Hawkins admitted that although he had predicted his own high chance of death, he could not bring himself to betray Kaidou and return to Kid's side, making Drake remember their past conversation and rightfully concluding that Hawkins was referring to himself back then right before Hawkins collapsed to the floor.[22]\n\nFinal Saga[]\n\nEgghead Arc[]\n\nAfter the Raid on Onigashima, Drake's status and whereabouts were seemingly unknown as SWORD lost contact with him since then.[65]\n\nThe next day, having been reuniting with the Marines, Drake recovered at the Marine GS General Hospital. After being visited by Kujaku and wanting space, he listened to Vegapunk's speech to the world while recuperating from his injuries.[66]\n\nMajor Battles[]\n\nInterrupted the fight between Killer and Urouge\n\nX Drake, Urouge, Scratchmen Apoo and Basil Hawkins vs. Kizaru and a Pacifista\n\nX Drake vs. Scotch\n\nX Drake vs. Caribou Pirates\n\nX Drake vs. Sanji\n\nX Drake vs. Juki\n\nX Drake vs. Roronoa Zoro\n\nX Drake and Zoro vs. Apoo\n\nX Drake, Scratchmen Apoo, Inbi, and Zanki vs. Maha and Guernica\n\nFiller Battles[]\n\nX Drake and Basil Hawkins vs. Sanji (Flower Capital bathhouse)\n\nEleven Supernovas (minus Law and Zoro) vs. Douglas Bullet\n\nTranslation and Dub Issues[]\n\nWhile written as is, the X in his name is meant to be read as diez (as \"X\" is the Roman numeral for \"ten\"), which means \"ten\" in Spanish, and can also be used as a surname.\n\nEarly Concepts[]\n\nIn the eighth volume of One Piece Magazine, several early design sketches for Drake were revealed, some of which included different variations of his hat.[67]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nPlayable Appearances[]\n\nOne Piece: Gigant Battle! 2 New World\n\nOne Py Berry Match\n\nOne Piece Treasure Cruise\n\nOne Piece: Dance Battle\n\nOne Piece: Burning Blood\n\nOne Piece Thousand Storm\n\nJumputi Heroes\n\nOne Piece Bounty Rush\n\nOne Piece Bon!

This befits Drake's Devil Fruit.\n\nDrake is the only Marine to have eaten an Ancient Zoan Devil Fruit.\n\nDrake is the first person to be revealed to have eaten an Ancient Zoan Devil Fruit, when its concept is first introduced.\n\nIn Blue Deep databook, Drake was given a birthday of October 10, when his birthday had already been given as October 24.[68] This makes him one of two characters, along with Viola, to have been given two different birthdays.\n\nDrake has a revolution theme. His birthday, October 24, is a date of the beginning of the October Revolution according to the Julian calendar. His epithet may be a reference to a real-world red flag, an international symbol of socialism and communism.\n\nIn the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th fan polls of most popular characters, Drake was ranked 35th, 58th, 90th, and 41st, respectively.\n\nSBS-Based Trivia[]\n\nDrake's birthday, October 24, is a reference to his surname X, since it is 10 in Roman numerals and the 24th letter in the English alphabet.[11]\n\nCoincidentally, he shares his birthday with the music artist Drake.\n\nDrake's name was taken from 16th century English adventurer and privateer Francis Drake.[69]\n\nDrake is the only member of the Tobiroppo not named after a card game.[70] He is also the only member not to have horns.\n\nHowever, his epithet may refer to Red Flags, the \"game of terrible dates\", a card game where the goal is to create the best date.\n\nDrake's favorite food is chicken rice, and his least favorite food is eggs.[71]\n\nDrake's animal resemblance is a allosaurus, a reference to his Devil Fruit's abilities.[72]\n\nIf One Piece was set in the real world, then Drake would be from Turkey.[73]\n\nWhen a fan asked which flower Drake resembles the most, Oda answered he most resembles a gentian.[72]\n\nIf Drake was not a pirate, then he would be a zookeeper.[73]\n\nDrake's hobbies are being a reptile maniac and studying astrophysics.[74]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nFrancis Drake – Wikipedia article on the real-life privateer Drake is named after.\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nFormer MarinesMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nTransportationShip(s):Vehicles:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesMarine Bases:Groups:Events:Concepts:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Specials, Featurettes and OVAs:Other:\n\nPersonnel:Associates:\n\nMonkey D.
