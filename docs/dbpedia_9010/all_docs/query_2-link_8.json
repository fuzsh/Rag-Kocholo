        "text": "This is an abridged version of Charles Xavier's history. For a complete history see Charles Xavier's Expanded History\n\nEarly Years[]\n\nCharles Francis Xavier was the mutant son of a wealthy nuclear researcher, Dr. Brian Xavier, and his wife, Sharon.[41] The Nuclear Research Facility where Dr. Xavier worked in Alamogordo, New Mexico[33] was actually a cover for the study of genetic mutations,[42] secretly run by Dr. Nathan Milbury, which was one of Mister Sinister's many aliases.[16] While still gestating in his mother's womb, Charles recognized his twin as a malignant presence which he preemptively tried to kill with his nascent psychic abilities, causing the fetus' miscarriage.[43] Since a very young age, Charles was subjected to Sinister's experiments, alongside Carter Ryking, his best friend and son of one of Dr. Xavier's colleagues, Dr. Alexander Ryking.[44][45]\n\nWhen Charles was nine, Dr. Xavier died in an accident in Alamogordo and the project was deactivated.[41][44] Sharon moved to their ancestral mansion in Westchester after marrying her late husband's ex-colleague, Dr. Kurt Marko, in hopes of maintaining a well-structured family for Charles. However, Dr. Marko had married her for her wealth and due to being jealous of Dr. Xavier,[41] though it might also have been due to Mister Sinister's machinations, as a way to keep Charles under his watch through Marko.[46] Charles faced problems with his new family when Marko brought his teenage son, Cain Marko to live in the mansion, as Cain constantly bullied Charles. To make matters worse, Dr. Marko violently abused Sharon. With his growing telepathic powers, Charles attempted to alleviate her pain by sharing it. However, Charles could not prevent his mother's ruin, as she succumbed to alcoholism and died of a broken heart.[41][39][46]\n\nWhen Cain attempted to extort money from Dr. Marko by accusing him of murdering Dr. Xavier, a fight erupted between father and son, causing some of Dr. Marko's lab equipment to explode. Dr. Marko was mortally wounded but managed to drag the two children to safety before dying, begging forgiveness for not saving Dr. Xavier when he had the chance and telling Charles to keep his powers secret from Cain. From then on, the orphans Xavier and Marko lived as enemies under the same roof as Xavier realized the potential of his mutant powers. Due to his telepathy, which gradually cost him his hair, Xavier excelled in most activities he engaged in, causing Marko's jealousy to escalate to the point he provoked Xavier into a car crash, badly injuring him and making him part ways with his step-brother.[41] A brilliant student, throughout his educational career Xavier attended Harvard University in his early teens graduating when he was sixteen years old.[11]\n\nMoira[]\n\nIntent on undertaking graduate studies, Xavier won a scholarship to England's Oxford University, to gain his Ph.Ds. in Genetics and Biophysics. Studying the consequences of genetic mutations in society, Xavier dreamt of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans.[47] During a fair in Oxford, he was approached by Moira Kinross, who questioned his wonderful dream for the future of mutants. As Xavier established telepathic contact by her request, she revealed herself to be a mutant who had lived several lives, knowing Xavier in many of them. Completely crushed by the experience, Xavier was left thunderstruck by the revelation that despite his best efforts, mutantkind would always lose. In her tenth and tentatively last life cycle, Moira declared they must break all rules and unite mutantkind.[36][48]\n\nIn Moira, Xavier had found an academic peer with whom he could openly discuss his ideas and plans. Xavier was put into contact with her advisor, a revolutionary geneticist at Oxford, without knowing his true identity as Mister Sinister.[11] Moreover, Moira was romantically involved with lance corporal Joe MacTaggert, though, after Xavier rescued Moira from the wrecks of a car accident caused by MacTaggert, the two geniuses fell in love.[35]\n\nAround this period, Xavier was confronted on campus by two mutants named Logan and Victor Creed who, upon learning that the US government was actively imprisoning mutants, were seeking to band mutants together in a common group. Xavier flat out turned Logan and Creed down.[49] At some point in his life, Xavier also worked alongside Karl Lykos, a fellow scholar who was interested in mutation.[50]\n\nAfter experiencing the happiest period of his life following his engagement to Moira, Xavier was drafted and sent to Korea.[34] In the Korean War, Xavier and his step-brother Cain Marko served in the same unit. Attempting to bring back the deserting Marko, Xavier witnessed Marko discovering a mystical ruby in the Temple of Cyttorak that transformed him into the unstoppable Juggernaut. Just then, enemy high explosive bombardment caused a cave-in and Marko was buried under several thousand tons of rock.[41] Xavier also served alongside Carmen Pryde on search and rescue missions, where he earned the nickname \"the Good Shepherd\".[11] Xavier survived and, while he recovered from his battlefield wounds, he received a letter from Moira announcing their engagement's end.[34]\n\nMeeting His Shadows[]\n\nAfter his failed engagement, Xavier traveled abroad, bumming around the Mediterranean, eventually settling in the island of Kirinos, where he found himself helping people, a therapeutic experience for him. From Kirinos, Xavier moved on to Cairo, Egypt, where in the city's main bazaar, he was pickpocketed by a young girl thief. While trying to establish contact with her, Xavier was smashed down by a powerful psychic attack, leading him to a nearby saloon. There, he met and battled Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King, the first malicious mutant he had ever met. After defeating his foe, Xavier realized how deadly mutant powers could be in the wrong hands. This spurred Xavier towards what would become his life's work as he decided to bring mankind and its mutant children together in peace and harmony, aiming to protect humanity from evil mutants and innocent mutants from human oppression, believing that both could peacefully coexist.[34]\n\nXavier next went to the seaport city of Haifa, Israel, to meet with an old friend of his, the head of a clinic for traumatized Holocaust victims, psychiatrist Daniel Shomron. One of Shomron's worst cases was the catatonic Gabrielle Haller, whom Xavier awoke by secretly using his telepathy and eventually fell in love with. Moira's journals would later reveal that she and Charles had hatched the idea for a group of mutants that could combine their powers to resurrect the dead. Lacking a mutant with the ability to warp reality, Moira used her experience as a geneticist to identify potential matches for her and Charles that might result in such a mutant. This match was Gabrielle Haller, suggesting Charles had purposefully sought her out in Israel.[48]\n\nHelping at the clinic, Xavier also became friends with a man known as Magnus, a volunteer who was a survivor of Auschwitz. Over the weeks that followed, Xavier and Magnus debated hypothetical scenarios regarding what would happen if humanity was faced with a new super-powered race of humans, with Xavier unaware that Magnus himself was also a mutant. While Xavier was optimistic, Magnus' experiences in the Holocaust led him to believe that humanity would ultimately oppress the new race of humans, as they had done with other minorities. The two friends ultimately revealed their powers to each other when they fought Nazi Baron von Strucker, and his Hydra agents, who had kidnapped Gabrielle since she knew the location of their secret cache of gold. Magnus attempted to kill von Strucker, but Xavier stopped him. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations were incompatible, Magnus left with the gold. Xavier stayed in Israel for some time before he and Haller separated on good terms.[37]\n\nXavier went in search for other mutants like himself. Still relying only on his powers and rumours, he finally made contact with another mutant; Prince Namor of Atlantis. Xavier revealed Namor's mutant heritage to the prince and convinced him to help him search for others of their kind. The pair had little luck, and Xavier was often forced to use his telepathy to temper Namor's rage, as the prince was still haunted by his experiences in World War II. After a misadventure with an escaped mutant named Tim Rhodes, Xavier tried to force Namor to face his past in an effort to finally mend his psyche. Xavier's attempt backfired, further shattering Namor's mind and leaving Xavier to wander alone once more.[51] At some point, following years of distinguished experiences, Xavier reunited with Moira to discuss the possibility of using her research results to help his crusade of guiding mutants. Her initial reaction was opposing to his proposition, claiming his hubris could cloud his potential for corruption.[12]\n\nParalyzed[]\n\nDuring his journeys, Xavier became fascinated by a mysterious, unexplored walled city in the Himalayas, which he managed to infiltrate with his mental powers. There, he encountered an alien named Lucifer, the advance scout for an invasion. Xavier foiled his plans by inciting a rebellion. In retaliation, Lucifer dropped a huge stone block on Xavier, leaving him trapped.[38] Xavier was found and freed by a young mutant rebel who had heard his telepathic cries for help.[52] Xavier was airlifted to Bombay, India. Unfortunately, the rock had permanently damaged his legs, rendering them unusable. During his recovery, as he fell into a deep depression due to losing the use of his legs, he was treated by Amelia Voght, a young American nurse, who made cheering him up her pet project. The two soon fell in love. While living in an apartment together in Bombay, Amelia found Xavier's notes on a device called Cerebro, that could detect mutants. Voght confronted Xavier, believing he had approached her as an experiment, since she was secretly a mutant herself. Realizing that he too was a mutant as he spoke to her telepathically, the couple grew even closer, and Xavier continued his plans with Amelia by his side.[39]\n\nReturning to America, Professor Xavier put himself into contact with various mutants, trying to help them control their powers. One of his pupils was the young Jean Grey, who had been under his supervision after her powers traumatically awakened as she telepathically experienced the emotions of a dying friend.[53] He also secretly trained the young girl who rescued him in the Himalayas as a spy, forging an identity for her as \"Tessa\", in order for her to work as a secretary for Sebastian Shaw, a wealthy mutant industrialist.[54] Xavier also helped a young mutant named Jamie Madrox, by keeping contact with his parents and providing them with resources to help the young Madrox keep his mutant abilities under control.[55]\n\nX-Men[]\n\nHaving collected data on various mutants whose gifts had manifested, Professor Xavier shared with Moira his intentions of creating a task force to train and prepare mutants to carry on his dream.[56] To this end, he formed an alliance with Fred Duncan, an FBI agent investigating the growing number of mutants. Xavier shared with Duncan his plan to locate young mutants and enroll them in his School for Gifted Youngsters, using his ancestral mansion home as a base to train them to use their powers, as well as provide them conventional educations, for humanity's benefit.[57] Vought stayed with Professor Xavier, partially because she loved him, but also to convince him to give up what she felt were nonsensical ideas.[39] Expecting the public return of his old friend, Xavier, accompanied by Voght, decided to meet with Magnus, who had revamped himself as the costumed terrorist Magneto, now sporting a helmet to shield him from telepathy. Xavier unsuccessfully pleaded with Magneto that the path of mutant supremacy would lead to results no different from what he had suffered during his childhood. As both men reminded each other that they had the power to destroy one another, Magneto left, with Professor Xavier hoping that he would see the error in his ways.[58]\n\nSupported by Duncan's intel, Xavier rescued the young mutant orphan Scott Summers from the clutches of Jack o' Diamonds, recruiting him as Cyclops, the first member of a group of mutants who would fight to improve the relations between mutants and humans.[59] Voght left Professor Xavier as Summers moved into the mansion, believing the best solution to the \"mutant problem\" being for mutants to lay low. Professor Xavier tried to force her to stay with his mental powers, but, immediately ashamed by this, he let her go.[39] Over the following months, Professor Xavier assembled his original team of X-Men: Cyclops, Iceman,[60] Angel,[61] Beast,[62] and Jean Grey, who took the name Marvel Girl. At Xavier's, Professor X tested his X-Men in the Danger Room, a facility that contained training machinery.[33]\n\nAfter months of preparation, Magneto made his first move against humanity, by seizing control of a military base in Cape Citadel in order to launch its missiles on human targets. He was unexpectedly confronted by the X-Men and escaped before being defeated.[33] Xavier's connections with Duncan placed the X-Men against their next foe, the teleporting thief Vanisher, who was defeated with Professor X's mental powers.[10] Professor X and the X-Men kept monitoring and interacting with other so-called evil mutants, such as the Blob,[63] and Magneto's own group, the Brotherhood – when Xavier pretended to have lost his mental powers after an accident to push the X-Men to the limit.[64] The X-Men and the Brotherhood faced each other again, when both Professor Xavier and Magneto unsuccessfully attempted to recruit Prince Namor of Atlantis.[65]\n\nProfessor X had to deal with a menace by his own, Lucifer, and left the X-Men under Cyclops' leadership.[66] As Xavier located Lucifer's hidden cave in Europe, he alerted his X-Men. As the X-Men traveled to help him, they were followed by the Avengers, who agreed to give the X-Men a chance to prove their might against the villain. With the diabolical Lucifer defeated, Xavier returned to his X-Men[67] and guided the team in investigating the mysterious Savage Land[68] and confronting the malignant Stranger.[69] A ghost from Xavier's past unexpectedly returned when his step-brother, Cain Marko, after years of being imprisoned in the ruins of the Korean temple where Xavier had last saw him, attacked Xavier's School as the unstoppable Juggernaut. Immune to Xavier's telepathy due to his helmet, Juggernaut was attacked by the X-Men and the Human Torch, who managed to remove the helmet, allowing Xavier to knock him out and arrest him.[70]\n\nA new threat emerged for mutantkind in the form of the anti-mutant activist, Bolivar Trask. Xavier proposed a debate against Trask to be broadcasted on TV as a way to counterattack his attempts of elevating anti-mutant hysteria. During the debate, Xavier was introduced to the Sentinels, robots created by Trask to defend humanity against mutants. However, the Sentinels rebelled against Trask's orders and captured him. Xavier led his X-Men to rescue Trask and eliminate the Sentinel-creating machine, the Master Mold. Xavier worked with the police to destroy the Sentinel base, and with the X-Men's actions and Trask's sacrifice, the menace was over for the moment.[71] During the crisis with the Master Mold, Magneto invaded the X-Mansion and incapacitated the X-Men upon their return.[72] Trapped in a floating gondola with his students, Professor X coordinated his X-Men to escape and summoned the Stranger to scare Magneto off.[73]\n\nLucifer resurfaced for a third time, seeking revenge against Professor X and planning to invade the whole world under his master's orders. He manipulated Blob and Unus into masquerading as members of the X-Men to ruin their reputation and orchestrated a direct mental attack against Xavier.[38] As the X-Men went to Lucifer's hidden base, Xavier was captured by his enemy's automatons and learned about his plans of operating the Dominus, a world-level brainwashing machine. After the X-Men destroyed Lucifer's robots, foiling his plans, his furious master cast him into an eternal exile, and Professor Xavier was finally free of him.[74]\n\nAfter training them for several years, Professor Xavier went underground, hiding from all of his original students save Jean, to prepare for the invasion of the alien Z'nox. He was aided by the reformed and dying villain, Changeling, who posed as him after receiving a portion of his telepathic power. The X-Men disbanded after \"Xavier\" was killed by Grotesk and Professor Xavier left all of his belongings to Scott. The real Professor Xavier returned with Havok and Lorna Dane to stop the invasion of the Z'Nox. Prof. Xavier probed every human mind on the planet and was left in a weakened state, but was revived using a device created by Bruce Banner.[75]\n\nIlluminati[]\n\nShortly after the Kree-Skrull War, Tony Stark called a meeting of some of the world's most influential superhuman figures; himself, Black Panther, Prince Namor, Doctor Strange, Reed Richards, Black Bolt, and Xavier. Stark felt that the Kree-Skrull war had shown the importance of uniting the Earth's disparate superhuman communities, in order to better defend the planet. The group discussed how best to do this, and eventually settled on a secret council, where they would convene to discuss potential threats and how best to tackle them. Black Panther declined the invitation, believing they were wrong to take the fate of the Earth into their own hands, but agreed to keep their secret.[76]\n\nThroughout the years, Xavier and the Illuminati covertly handled many crises. While they were instrumental in averting catastrophes, their actions would also endanger the world on many occasions. Xavier raised the group's first issue; the island of Krakoa.[77][76]\n\nSecond and Third Team of X-Men[]\n\nYears later, when most of his original students were captured by the mutant island Krakoa, Professor Xavier sent another team comprised of Dr. MacTaggert's students, Kid Vulcan (who was Cyclops' unknown brother), Petra, Darwin, and Sway, all of whom he gave quick, mental combat experience, to rescue his original students. Professor Xavier also approached Emma Frost, to be the team's telepath, but she refused, and the Professor erased the event from her memory. After the team freed Cyclops and Kid Vulcan revealed their connection, the entire team was seemingly killed. Cyclops escaped, but, when he made it back to Professor Xavier, the Professor wiped the traumatizing knowledge that his new-found brother had died saving him from Cyclops' memories, believing Cyclops could not carry on with the burden of this knowledge. Professor Xavier assembled another team of X-Men, including Banshee (former Factor Three operative), Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Sunfire, Thunderbird, and Wolverine to rescue the others on Krakoa, never revealing anything about Dr. MacTaggert's students. The mission was successful, and the team stayed together, save for Sunfire.[78]\n\nTheir next mission was to stop Count Nefaria and his Ani-Men, during which Thunderbird was killed attempting to stop Count Nefaria's escape.[79] The team went on to battle Kierrok[80] and Professor Xavier was captured by Stephen Lang's Sentinels and taken to his space station, where his X-Men rescued him.[81] After, Professor Xavier stayed with an injured Jean in the hospital, after she had piloted the shuttle back to Earth and declared herself the Phoenix.[82] At this time, Professor X had somehow also acquired a RS-150 Blackbird from S.H.I.E.L.D., as the X-Men's new transportation.[83] Lilandra Neramani, princess of the alien Shi'ar race managed to establish an intense psychic bond with Xavier across the vast distance that separated their two planets. She came to Earth to implore Prof. Xavier for his help against her mad, tyrannical brother, D'Ken Neramani, and he instantly, aided her by deploying his X-Men.[84][85] They journeyed to the M'kraan Crystal's homeworld to battle the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.[86]\n\nAfter briefly battling Weapon Alpha,[87] and, later, Warhawk,[88] Phoenix returned from the Savage Land to tell Professor X that all the X-Men were dead.[89] Prof. Xavier shut down the school and traveled with Lilandra to her kingdom, where she was crowned Empress. They fell in love, and, for a time, Professor Xavier lived on Chandilar, the Shi'ar throneworld, as Lilandra's consort.[34][90][91]\n\nProf. Xavier returned to Earth and resumed his position at the school. Professor X then located Kitty Pryde with Cerebro. Professor Xavier and three of the X-Men (Colossus, Storm, and Wolverine) set out for Deerfield, Illinois to contact her and possibly recruit her as a member of the X-Men. Unknown to Prof. Xavier, the mercenary, Warhawk, had planted a device that enabled his employers in the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club to monitor Cerebro's activities. The Inner Circle, thus, also learned about Kitty, and one of its leaders, Emma, now the White Queen, also went to contact her.[92] The X-Men then went on to battle the Hellfire Club while attempting to recruit Dazzler.[93] When trying to understand the motives of the Hellfire Club, Angel set-up an invite to a Hellfire Club party, where the Phoenix fell under Mastermind and the Hellfire Club's control and transformed into the Black Queen.[94] After the X-Men battled the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle, Phoenix underwent another transformation into the Dark Phoenix and soared through the universe, where she devoured an entire star and the five billion inhabitants of one of its planets.[95] When Phoenix returned to Earth, she threatened to kill everyone, but Professor X was able to keep Phoenix under control and helped her will herself back to normal. The X-Men were then teleported away by the Shi'ar.[96] The Shi'ar Empire had witnessed Dark Phoenix consuming the star, so Professor Xavier had no other choice but to challenge the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to a duel over the fate of the Phoenix. The battle triggered her transformation into Dark Phoenix once more and she understood that she would never be able to fully control the dark hunger inside and sacrificed herself on the Moon.[97][98]\n\nAt some point, Xavier and Moira visited Magneto on Island M. Xavier shared Moira's memories of her previous lives with Magneto, revealing to him that mutantkind was doomed to failure. Despite his initial mistrust, Magneto agreed with Xavier and Moira's proposal and joined them in their long-term plan for the survival of the mutant race.[99] Without Moira's knowing, both Xavier and Magneto then travelled to Bar Sinister to meet Mister Sinister, asking him for his help regarding the genetic collection of mutant DNA that he had acquired over the years. Mister Sinister wasn't interested in the deal but was suddenly killed by another Sinister who was enticed by the proposal since he himself possessed a functional X-Gene (Thunderbird's). Sinister agreed to the compromise but ended up having his memories of the encounter repressed so he would be sent on his course without knowing Xavier and Magneto's involvement until the day they prompted him to remember.[100]\n\nThe team went on to battle the Sentinels and during a coupe, first met the alien Brood and battled Deathbird and Admiral Samédàr to restore Lilandra to the Shi'ar throne, where Prof. Xavier was sent into a coma.[101] Unknown to anyone, Professor X had been implanted with a Brood Queen egg at the time.[102] Professor X woke from his coma to learn that his X-Men and Lilandra had left him. Around this time, Professor X aided Spider-Man in battling Mentallo and was unable to rebuild Anthony Power's son, Matthew's, comatose mind.[103] Professor Xavier was able to help Dr. Lykos, who had been trapped as Sauron. Professor X found that Dr. Lykos was infected with a genetic virus that mutated him and isolated the alien element in his DNA matrix, which cured him.[104]\n\nNew Mutants[]\n\nAfter a call from Reed Richards about a powerful, young mutant whose powers were out of control and with encouragement by Dr. MacTaggert, Prof. Xavier took Xuân Cao Mạnh to his mansion and Dr. MacTaggert also brought her foster daughter, Rahne Sinclair. Donald Pierce was determined to kill Prof. Xavier, as well as other superhuman mutants and had Danielle Moonstar's grandfather, Black Eagle, murdered. Prof. Xavier and the girls went to Moonstar's aid. After Dani joined the others rescued Roberto Da Costa and Samuel Guthrie. After being captured by Pierce, the youths rescued Professor X and he decided to take on a new class of mutant students whom he aptly named the New Mutants.[105]\n\nProfessor Xavier also employed a small staff to help with the raising of the students, beginning with the human Stevie Hunter, and Xi'an, as the school's secretary. Professor Xavier initially had brought the team together to use as embryos as the Brood Queen was beginning to exert its influence over him. After mysteriously trapping Psyche in the Danger Room, Professor X used her powers to attack the New Mutants.[106]\n\nThe X-Men returned from space with the knowledge that Professor X had been infected with an embryo and the Brood Queen revealed herself by transforming him. The mind of Professor Xavier asserted long enough to ask Cyclops to kill him, but Cyclops refused. Dr. MacTaggert and the X-Men's space-faring allies, the Starjammers, saved Prof. Xavier by transferring his mind into a newly cloned, somewhat younger body with functional legs. The experience made Professor Xavier feel like a \"whole man\", but his legs still had trouble working.[107]\n\nAfter Professor X had a televised debate with Reverend William Stryker, he, Scott, and Ororo were kidnapped by the Purifiers. While in captivity, Professor X was hooked to a machine operated by Dr. Phillip Ramsey, attempting to turn him against mutants with illusions of the X-Men killing him and Reverend Stryker saving him. After Professor X was brainwashed, he fired mental bolts at Scott and Ororo, seemingly killing them. Stryker had him taken to Madison Square Garden, where he was attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living mutants. Magneto, with his psi-shielded helmet, was able to distract the Professor enough for the X-Men to destroy the machine. Later at the mansion, Xavier admitted that Magneto had been right about humanity and began to accept his offer to join him until Scott stopped him and stated that he believed in the Professor's dream and would fight to see it come true. Professor X returned to his senses and declined Magneto's offer. Magneto left, calling them fools.[108]\n\nAt the return of the X-Men, Professor Xavier, initially, demoted Kitty Pryde (Sprite) to the New Mutants, an act that enraged her, until Kitty impressed him by defeating two Sidri, with the help of Lockheed.[109] While attending a fair the New Mutants were attacked by Viper and the Silver Samurai and Psyche was kidnapped. Professor Xavier decided to aid Team America and the New Mutants left without his permission to save Dani. Xi'an was lost to the New Mutants in an explosion. Sensing the Shadow King in Xi'an's disappearance, Professor Xavier ordered the New Mutants to take a vacation.[110]\n\nMutant terrorist Rogue came to Professor Xavier asking for help controlling her powers, which had caused her to absorb Carol Danvers' personality. Professor Xavier accepted her into his school and the X-Men, even after all the X-Men and Danvers herself stated they would quit if she was admitted. Eventually, the team reluctantly agreed. Professor Xavier and Lilandra continuously tried to understand why he felt intense pain every time he would attempt to walk, and she stated that she would soon have to leave to stop her sister from starting a war in her kingdom. After battling Mastermind again Professor Xavier hosted Cyclops' marriage to Madelyne Pryor at his mansion home.[111]\n\nProfessor Xavier later, bid farewell to his love, Lilandra, as she returned to Shi'ar space with the Starjammers. The X-Men battled the Brotherhood, as Mystique attempted to \"rescue\" her foster-daughter Rogue from the X-Men, believing Xavier had forced her leave from the Brotherhood, only to have Rogue tell her that she left of her own freewill. Professor Xavier shocked everyone with the full use of his legs.[112][113]\n\nProfessor Xavier maintained his principle of never rejecting a troubled soul and, after rescuing Rachel Summers from Selene, Professor X scanned her and welcomed her to his school and the X-Men. After the New Mutants battled a Demon Bear, Professor X invited Sharon Friedlander and Tom Corsi, two more humans, to work at his school. After returning to a ruined home, Professor X allowed Warlock to join the New Mutants.[114][115]\n\nAt this time, Professor X took a visiting professorship in genetics at Columbia University, where he was beaten by a hate crime driven, anti-mutant group of students. He was helped by the Morlock Healer. Professor X and the X-Men next battled James Proudstar, brother to the original Thunderbird who blamed Prof. Xavier for his brother's death, and the Hellions to rescue Banshee. Professor X, eventually, convinced Thunderbird that his brother died a hero's death, and he released them, stating Professor Xavier was an honorable man. To rescue Banshee, the X-Men had to infiltrate the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command), and the X-Men were officially outlawed.[116] After repeated assaults, from publicly announcing she was a mutant, Dazzler returned to Professor X and asked for training in the Danger Room. After her training, Professor X provided her with a new uniform that amplified and gave precision to her powers.[117]\n\nProfessor X met with his former lover, Gabrielle, on Muir Island and discovered that he was her teenage son's father. The boy, David Haller, suffered from multiple personality disorder and had vast psionic powers beyond even his father. After helping him and the New Mutants to escape from David's mind, Professor Xavier promised he would always be there for him.[118]\n\nStarjammers[]\n\nFeeling the return of the Beyonder, Magneto once again joined forces with the X-Men. This time, due to Prof. Xavier's weakened state from being attacked by a group of mutant haters, the Professor asked Magneto to temporarily join the team. After stopping a scheme of Loki's, Magneto went on trial in front of the World Court and was attacked by Fenris, Andreas and Andrea von Strucker, the children of Baron von Strucker. Professor Xavier suffered physical injuries and psychic strains that left him on the brink of death and asked Magneto to become his successor as headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters and as mentor of the New Mutants. Lilandra and the Starjammers returned and took Professor Xavier into outer space, where they used Shi'ar technology to restore him to health, but due to damage sustained by their ship, were not able to return him.[119]\n\nWhile on the run from the Shi'ar, Professor Xavier was reunited with Illyana. Illyana had been attacked by the Magus, lost her teammates, and battled all the demons of Limbo, who had been infected with the Transmode Virus. Prof. Xavier was Illyana's last thought, and she was sent to the planet that he was on with the Starjammers and, with the Professor, Lilandra, and Binary, she returned to Limbo. After defeating S'ym, they gathered all of her teammates throughout time and space and returned to the planet that the Professor was on with the Starjammers and Cypher and Warlock re-wrote the Magus' DNA, effectively reducing him to infancy. During this time, Professor Xavier scanned his students for current affairs and learned of the Marauders, the loss of Nightcrawler, Colossus, and Shadowcat, and the fact that his original students were the mutant hunting team of X-Factor. Professor X, initially, decided to return, but later decided to stay-on and continue to aid the Starjammers, who he believed he owed his life to, and used Karma to mentally control Illyana into sending the New Mutants back home.[120]\n\nMuir Island Saga[]\n\nAfter an extended sojourn in space with the Starjammers, Xavier finally returned to Earth. Both the original and second teams of X-Men reassembled under his leadership, along with new recruits like Gambit and Jubilee. Xavier led the X-Men against the Shadow King, only to have his spine broken in the Astral Plane battling his son, leaving him crippled and confined to a wheelchair once more.[121]\n\nXavier enhanced the X-Mansion's technology with help from Forge, re-establishing the X-Men in Westchester.[42] At some point, he then commissioned Forge with adding a new functionality into Cerebro: the ability to store every mutant’s thoughts and personality traits.[122] At the same time, an ideological schism broke out once again between Magneto and Xavier. Magneto was enraged after the revelation that Moira had secretly manipulated his genome in order to minimize the effects of his magnetic powers on his personality. This led to a confrontation between Xavier's X-Men and Magneto's new group of followers, the Acolytes.[123] After the confrontation, Xavier and Moira lost Magneto as an ally for their plan.[48]\n\nX-Cutioner's Song[]\n\nWhile holding a mutant rights speech, Xavier was nearly assassinated by Stryfe, being infected with the fatal Techno-Organic Virus but was saved by none other than Apocalypse. As a temporary side-effect he gained full use of his legs and devoted his precious time to the youngest recruit on his team, Jubilee.[124]\n\nSince the X-Men were all now highly trained adults, Xavier renamed the school in his mansion the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. He took control of a private school, the Massachusetts Academy, and made it the new School for Gifted Youngsters, where yet another new class of young mutants, Generation X, were taught.[125]\n\nOnslaught[]\n\nIn a battle with Magneto, Xavier lost his temper over his old friend ripping the Adamantium from Wolverine's body and used his mental powers to shut down Magneto's conscious mind by transferring it into his own.[126] In the process Xavier's mind was inadvertently infected by the malice within Magneto's psyche. The result was that the dark sides of Magneto's and Xavier's minds combined and physically manifested themselves as the nearly invincible entity called Onslaught, who usurped Xavier's psionic powers.[127] The world's greatest super heroes narrowly defeated Onslaught, who appeared to perish. However, to ensure that Xavier never again spawned a being like Onslaught, Dr. Valerie Cooper of the United States government took him into custody. Although Xavier was willing to serve as a prisoner of the United States government, he was appalled when it turned him over to the custody of Bastion, head of the anti-mutant Operation: Zero Tolerance.[128][129]\n\nThe Brotherhood & Cadre K[]\n\nXavier was eventually freed and found by Cerebro. He briefly led the Brotherhood during this time.[130] He then left Earth to train a group of mutant Skrulls called Cadre K.[131]\n\nDream's End[]\n\nWhen Mystique blew up Moira MacTaggert's laboratory complex, fatally wounding her, Charles went to the Astral Plane to meet with her and retrieve information on the cure to the Legacy Virus, but after gathering the information he did not want to leave her alone. If not for Jean pulling him back, the Professor would have died with his first love, who stated she had no regrets.[132] Later, it was revealed that Moira faked her death using a Shi'ar golem in an experiment designed with help from Xavier, being the first experience Xavier had with the mutant resurrection process he would refine years later.[48]\n\nEve of Destruction[]\n\nAfter the Legacy Virus was cured, Magneto assembled an army on his mutant nation of Genosha. Xavier went to try and dissuade him, but it took an interim X-Men team to stop Magneto, who had crucified Xavier in Magda Square, and former lover and disenchanted Acolyte Amelia Voght to free him.[133] Genosha was eventually destroyed, and Magneto presumed killed, through the machinations of Cassandra Nova.[134]\n\nGoing Public[]\n\nXavier regathered his X-Men as a public team and created the X-Corp in light of the incidents with Cassandra Nova Xavier, his 'evil twin.' She had revealed his mutation to the world, something he needed to do but did not want to sully his reputation over.[135]\n\nIn the wake of Cassandra Nova's attack on the Shi'ar, Lilandra had gone insane and tried to assassinate Charles on a trip to the X-Corporation branch in Mumbai. Lilandra, believing that too much disaster had come from the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men, annulled her marriage to Xavier.[17]\n\nHis stepbrother, the Juggernaut, defected to the X-Men once Xavier reached out to him while he had nowhere to go. Cain redeemed himself, and the brothers finally came to understand one another.[136]\n\nShortly thereafter, Kuan-Yin Xorn revealed himself as Magneto and attacked the School and killed Jean Grey, before being killed by Wolverine. However, Xavier was apparently aware that Xorn had merely impersonated Magneto, and that the real Magneto was still on Genosha. Traveling there, he and Magneto once again set aside their differences and tried to rebuild Genosha.[137]\n\nDanger[]\n\nXavier briefly returned to help Cyclops' team with Danger, whom he revealed was a sentient entity kept in the Danger Room to help make it a unique and realistic training setting. The revelation that Xavier had known Danger was sentient but had ignored this in order to further the X-Men's training caused the X-Men to bitterly reject him.[138]\n\nHouse of M[]\n\nAfter the Scarlet Witch lost control of her powers and suffered a nervous breakdown, leading to the murder of several Avengers, Magneto brought her to Xavier in order for him to help repair her shattered psyche. Despite his best efforts, Xavier was unable to help Wanda, and her grip on reality began to slip further and further away. He called a meeting of the X-Men and Avengers to discuss the best course of action, and several of those present argued for euthanizing the Scarlet Witch, as her reality warping powers placed all of existence in danger. Quicksilver overheard this meeting, and when a tired and hopeless Magneto echoed this sentiment, Quicksilver convinced his sister to use her powers to alter reality and create a world where their friends and family had all they wanted.[139][140]\n\nThe result was a world where mutants were the majority, and Magneto was ruler of the world. Cracks in this new world began to appear, however. After the mutant Layla Miller restored the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they traveled to Genosha where they discovered that Magneto had erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. They were horrified until Cloak faded into the grave and discovered there was nobody inside. A battle soon broke out, and after Magneto's memories were restored and he realized what his children had done, he lashed out, and killed Quicksilver. Wanda, mad with grief, resurrected her brother and restrained her father and everyone else. Bitterly accusing her father of loving mutantkind more than his own children, an angry Wanda restored reality with one caveat: no more mutants. Doctor Strange and Emma Frost managed to rescue a handful of mutants from being de-powered, but Professor Xavier was one of countless mutants that lost their powers.[141]\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire[]\n\nThe truth about Xavier sending Moira's students to Krakoa all those years ago was finally discovered when an energy-mass comprised of all the depowered mutants' powers revived Kid Vulcan, now known simply as Vulcan. In a rage he attacked the X-Men, causing Xavier to come out of hiding. Use of his legs had been restored to him after the House of M, though he was no longer a mutant. Vulcan made Xavier tell the X-Men what he had done. After Vulcan was defeated and flew off into space, Cyclops told Xavier that he was no longer welcome at the X-Mansion for what he had done, though some of his other former students were more forgiving, including Beast.[142]\n\nEven though Xavier was no longer welcome at the Institute, he nevertheless formed a new team composed of Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Nightcrawler, Warpath, and Polaris for the express purpose of tracking down Vulcan before he could enact his vengeance against the Shi'ar Empire. In the midst of a coup involving Vulcan and the Shi'ar royal family, Xavier was imprisoned and briefly tortured, and then thrown into the M'kraan Crystal by Vulcan, who wished to claim his revenge against the Professor by killing him. Xavier drifted into the crystal but was rescued by Darwin. When he emerged from the crystal, he found that it had restored his powers. He returned to Earth and then began to search for his old colleague Magneto, who had also been de-powered.[143]\n\nAfter the Hulk returned to Earth after being exiled by the Illuminati he came to the mansion demanding to know whether or not Xavier would have voted in favor of exiling him to outer space, as Xavier had been missing during the time when the Illuminati made this decision. Xavier gave an honest answer, that he would have, and the Hulk proceeded to try and capture him, so that he could face punishment with the other Illuminati. Despite their anger towards him, his students came to his protection, and a myriad of X-Men teams fought the Hulk in order to save the Professor. All were defeated with ease however, and the Professor refused to flee, feeling that he needed to own up to his sins. However, the Hulk was swayed from killing Xavier by Mercury, who angrily and desperately told him that the X-Men had suffered enough death after the Decimation. Seeing the many gravestones on the grounds of the mansion, the Hulk surmised that their deaths had at least partly been Xavier's fault, and he decided to spare Xavier's life so that he could live with his guilt. Xavier was also made the steward of the Mind Gem, as part of the Illuminati's attempt to keep the Infinity Gauntlet from falling into the wrong hands.[144][145]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nXavier's relationship with the X-Men became even more strained when he tried to get involved in the crisis that erupted after the birth of the first mutant baby since M-Day. Still angry and distrustful, Cyclops refused his help.[146] He agreed to step back, but was brought back to the mix when Cable asked for his assistance in securing the baby and finding an escape route.[147][148] After the final bloody battle had taken place and Cable jumped into the future with the baby, Bishop fired a shot to kill Cable, but instead hit Xavier in the head.[149]\n\nProfessor Xavier was rescued from the brink of death by Exodus and his Acolytes, who quietly took him to their hideout, New Avalon. There, away from the intervention of the X-Men, Exodus telekinetically dismantled Xavier's brain to work on repairing it. As a result, many of Xavier's memories were destroyed. As part of the healing process, Exodus enlisted a familiar face to help Xavier, his shadow and nemesis, Magneto.[12] Still depowered from the mutant decimation, Magneto's very existance was seen by his former acolytes as blasphemous. As Xavier was revived from his catatonic state, he and Magneto were attacked by Frenzy. Magneto was able to subdue her, sparking the ire of Exodus. The amnesiac Xavier then engaged Exodus in psychic combat to protect himself and Magneto.[150] After emerging victorious, Exodus surprisingly offered him leadership of the Acolytes. He immediately refused the offer, instead choosing to rebuild the missing parts of his past and his lost connections.[151]\n\nThe first step Xavier took when restructuring his life's story was visiting Carter Ryking, who was still insane and now depowered in a mental facility.[152] This coincided with Xavier being targeted for assassination by the Assassins Guild. He was protected by his former student Gambit, a member of the rival Thieves Guild. Gambit informed Xavier that the Assassins Guild had a hit list that consisted of mutants formerly experimented on by Mister Sinister in Alamogordo, including Xavier, Ryking, Cain Marko, and Sebastian Shaw. When visiting Ryking a second time, Xavier found out he had suddenly passed away, supposedly of natural causes. In the ruins of the facility in Alamogordo, the Assassins Guild struck again.[46] Having investigated the mystery as well, Shaw joined Xavier and Gambit. Xavier was captured by the guild's employer: Amanda Müeller, a former research scientist from Alamogordo and a subject of Sinister herself. She exposed how Mister Sinister had a secret plan to resurrect himself if he ever perished in battle. Those he experimented on as children were part of Project Cronus, having been inserted with enough of Sinister's genetic material to be supplanted by his own personality. Müeller wanted to eliminate the potential candidates so she could host Mister Sinister's powers while suppressing his psyche. To that end, she mortally wounded Xavier, but unexpectedly caused Mister Sinister to take his body.[153] Possessing Xavier's body, Mister Sinister put Müeller down. However, as Gambit and Shaw destroyed the Cronus machine that kept his consciousness in the host body, Xavier was able to prevail and rid his mind of his enemy's influence.[154]\n\nWorried that Mister Sinister had also hidden his essence in Cyclops, Professor Xavier finally chose to reveal himself to his former pupil. In the woods surrounding the X-Men's new base in San Francisco, Xavier telepathically probed Cyclops' mind without his full consent. In retaliation, Cyclops had Emma Frost prepare herself to psychically attack Xavier in order to investigate Sinister's possible return.[155] After being punished by Frost with his own sins, Xavier recollected some crucial lost memories. At peace, he departed, leaving the X-Men under Cyclops' leadership.[9] Wolverine realized Xavier was, in fact, alive. Enraged at Cyclops and Frost for keeping this information from him, he searched for Xavier by himself. The two old friends reunited with each other as Wolverine needed help with psychically deprogramming his amnesiac and murderous son, Daken.[156] In coalition with Sinister's reincarnated self, Miss Sinister, Shaw attempted to manipulate Daken to serve as his private assassin in an attempt to perform a coup d'etat in the Hellfire Club. Simultaneously, Xavier and Wolverine went on a mission to assess the situation.[157] Despite not approving Wolverine's brutal methods,[158] Xavier joined him in a final showdown against Shaw and Sinister, who were bested in combat. However, when Xavier accessed Daken's mind, he could not anticipate a mental backlash that put him out of commission. Free from any machinations, Daken rebelled against all present.[8] In the end, Xavier showed Daken the truth about his tragic origin to calm him down. Wolverine parted ways with Xavier afterwards, forgiving him for having manipulated the course of his life.[159]\n\nResuming his journey, Xavier turned his attention towards his stepbrother Juggernaut next. Wishing for reconciliation, Xavier soon realized the brutal Juggernaut, who had returned to his criminal ways to regain the power of Cyttorak, would have murdered him without a second though. As a response, Xavier trapped Juggernaut in a mental illusion, forcing him to never cross his path again.[160] His next mission involved Rogue, whom he wished to finally cure from the affliction her powers caused her. He enlisted Gambit to accompany him to the Australian Outback, where she resided in isolation.[161] Upon arrival, Xavier and Gambit found the ghost town where Rogue was supposed to be as a massive conglomerate of different environments.[162] Xavier identified the cause of the odd circumstances was Danger, who had reverted to her function as a virtual reality simulator after being targeted and corrupted by Shi'ar bounty-hunters.[163] To cease her erratic behavior, Xavier once again trapped her into a compliant program[164] with the subsequent intention of releasing her completely of any bounds. Fully free, Danger defeated the criminals, forgave Xavier, and assisted him in finding a solution to Rogue's uncontrollable abilities.[165] As his next step, Xavier returned to New Avalon, this time to fully destroy it and put an end to Exodus' activities permanently. He convinced the Acolytes to disband, with most of them joining the X-Men in San Francisco, afterwards.[166]\n\nUtopia[]\n\nAfter coercing Exodus to disband the Acolytes, Xavier was approached by Norman Osborn, who had ascended as head of national security.[166] Osborn incarcerated Xavier alongside other mutants in one of H.A.M.M.E.R.'s bases in Alcatraz Island, where his powers were siphoned by the Omega Machine.[167] Meanwhile, Osborn had Mystique impersonate Xavier to the public as part of his agenda to discredit the X-Men in San Francisco.[168] Osborn believed he had an ally in Emma Frost, who led his own dark version of the X-Men. In fact, she was an infiltrator and identified Xavier as one of the captives.[169] Cyclops had the X-Club repurpose the ruins of Asteroid M into an island-nation named Utopia, to which all of the mutants residing in San Francisco relocated to, outside Osborn's reach. With their people safe, Frost had her X-Men rebel against Osborn and liberate the inmates.[170] Frost and Xavier joined forces to stop Osborn's main weapon, the nigh-omnipotent Sentry. Although successful, Frost was partially infected with the essence of the Sentry's dark half, the Void. Freed from Osborn, mutantkind resettled on Utopia.[171]\n\nJoining the X-Men on Utopia, Xavier tried to advise Cyclops. His advice was often ignored by his former student, who still had issues trusting the Professor. With his son having returned to Earth through the machinations of Magik, Xavier dedicated himself to repairing his son's psyche, aided by Dr. Nemesis. When Nemesis proposed a radical new therapy to remove the multiple personalities from David's mind, Xavier objected, believing it was causing too much damage to David's psyche. Xavier was proven right; when he entered David's mind, he was attacked by a new personality, which had been created as a reaction to Nemesis' therapy. Xavier fought the entity but lost. The new personality used its powers to warp reality, creating a world where mutantkind was a besieged and dying people, and where David was a hero. Xavier and other telepaths were kept sedated, as they were still able to remember reality as it had been.\n\nXavier was eventually freed from his coma, and helped his son to see the truth, and convinced him to absorb the rogue personality and put reality back into its proper order.[172]\n\nAfter Legion regained consciousness from his creation of the Age of X universe, Charles together with a team of X-Men helped him find his lost personalities. After Legion suffered a massive shock to his nervous system, Charles continued to care for him, nursing him back to health.[173]\n\nDeath of a Mentor[]\n\nCharles was seen on the shores of Utopia with his son in intense pain, together with various other psychics as the Phoenix arrived to claim its host. Through the misguided intervention of the Avengers, the Phoenix was divided and possessed five X-Men. Later, after the battle of Wakanda, Charles telepathically contacted the Phoenix-possessed Scott Summers to express his severe disappointment in their recent actions and made it clear that unless they ended their madness right away, he would have to take action and use the appropriate force to bring the possessed X-Men down.[22]\n\nAfter the power of the Phoenix was redistributed between Scott and Emma Frost, pushing them even further over the edge, Charles aided the Avengers and X-Men in taking them down. His powers managed to nullify Scott's for a small period of time in which the Avengers attacked. Knowing he couldn't defeat the Avengers without the whole Phoenix Force, Scott took the final portion from Emma. Xavier attacked again and demanded he stop but Cyclops finally lost control and killed Xavier before turning into Dark Phoenix.[22]\n\nRed Shadow[]\n\nCharles' death triggered a mental shock wave that caused his son Legion to lose control over his powers and birth a new persona that at first took the shape of a yellow goblin-like creature,[174] and later the form of Charles Xavier himself.[175] After recovering, David made it his mission to uphold his father's legacy.[175] Professor X's spirit was later seen in the Heaven dimension along with Nightcrawler's spirit at the time when Azazel invaded Heaven.[176] As part of his will and testament, Xavier left his Infinity Gem to Beast, leading to Beast being inducted into the Illuminati as Charles' replacement.[177]\n\nAfter his death, Charles Xavier's brain was harvested by a clone of the Red Skull, who took Xavier's vast psionic powers for himself.[178] A fragment of Xavier's psyche, which had escaped the scrubbing of his memories, still existed in the Red Skull's mind preventing him from unleashing the full potential of his powers.[179]\n\nShmidt's Red Onslaught persona emerged once Magneto killed him in Genosha.[180] In order to defeat him, the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom cast a spell to invert the axis of Skull's mind and bring out a fragment of Charles Xavier still present in Shmidt's mind. The spell was a success, and the Red Skull was knocked unconscious and reverted from his Red Onslaught form. Before the Skull could wake up to reveal whether Charles Xavier was now in control or not, as the X-Men wanted, the Avengers decided to be cautious and take the Red Skull to Stark Tower.[181]\n\nIn order to help cast a reinversion spell, due to the original having also accidentally affected heroes and villains and made them become their moral opposites, Steve Rogers freed the Red Skull, now known as the \"White Skull\" in his inverted form. In this form, it appeared that Charles' fragment was the dominant personality. Once the reinversion spell was cast, the Red Skull became the dominant persona once more.[182]\n\nMonths later, the Avengers Unity Division finally put an end to the Red Skull's abuse of Charles' gifts. After successfully apprehending the villain, Rogue took him to Beast,[183] who performed brain surgery on him to remove those segments that belonged to Xavier. At Rogue's request, the Human Torch incinerated those parts, to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands again, and in order to finally put Xavier to rest.[184]\n\nA Man Called X[]\n\nA portion of Charles' spirit was collected by the Shadow King and brought to the Astral Plane, where Xavier was forced to partake in an endless battle against his dire enemy using their psychic powers. After what felt like, or might have been, a thousand years in the Astral Plane, Charles tricked the Shadow King into luring members of the X-Men into their game, hoping their presence could give him the advantage to put an end to the confrontation.[185] The X-Men ultimately defeated the Shadow King and Fantomex donated his body to Professor X's astral form while his mind remained in the Astral Plane.[1] Using Fantomex's body, Xavier built himself a new, younger body.[186] He additionally decided to go simply by \"X,\" believing that it didn't feel right to go by his real name just yet since he had been reborn.\n\nThe Shadow King's defeat unleashed his source of power, Proteus.[187] The X-Men followed him to Fetters Hill, a small village from which he intended to merge the real world with the Astral Plane.[186] After Proteus launched seeds into many cities of the world to transform them,[188] X convinced Psylocke to create a network between the world's psychics and use their power to push back Proteus' influence. The Shadow King had planted a portion of himself into X's mind, which allowed him to take advantage of the network to escape from the Astral Plane into the real world.[189] After the Shadow King defeated the X-Men, X managed to recover and worked together with Psylocke to create a deeper psychic network to destroy the monster. X erased the memories of all of the X-Men involved in his return, but not before using his telepathy to soothe their minds in various ways, as thanks for their aid. The sole exception was Psylocke, who was spared so she could watch over him in case the Shadow King wasn't truly gone from his mind.[190]\n\nHouse of X[]\n\nSeveral months later, Xavier, Magneto and Moira set to work realizing a plan that had been in the making for decades; uniting all of mutantkind under one sovereign state. Xavier made contact with Krakoa, which agreed to a partnership with mutantkind. Xavier brought Cypher to the island, allowing the omnilingual mutant to enter into contact with the true entity of the island (its genius loci). Cypher conversed deeply with Krakoa, learning about its language (called \"Krakoan\") and some of its history. Charles then tasked Cypher with building an interface system on Krakoa to allow mutantkind to inhabit the island. Also, Cypher helped create four different systems involving transit, monitoring, defense, and observation.[100] With the help of both Sinister and Forge, Xavier ended up refining Moira's studies of resurrection, establishing “the Five”, a group of mutants assembled to resurrect all mutants who had died premature deaths.[191]\n\nMoira and Xavier tasked several technopath mutants (such as Cypher and Sage) with creating a system called \"Sleeping Giant\" to monitor for Nimrod technological thresholds being reached and/or the attempted creation of a \"Mother Mold\": a replicating, adaptive Sentinel factory that was self-aware and capable of creating Master Molds. After detecting a Mother Mold in orbit around the Sun, Xavier and Magneto tasked the X-Men with destroying it and preventing the creation of Nimrod, whose rise had doomed mutantkind in Moira's ninth life.[191] In addition, Charles Xavier bought world leading pharmaceutical companies with his vast wealth to produce three new super drugs from Krakoan flowers, offering them to every country that formally recognized Krakoa as a nation. These drugs operated as an adaptive antibiotic, extended the human lifespan by five years, and prevented human \"diseases of the mind\" respectively.\n\nXavier and Magneto recruited various mutants, both friends such as Emma Frost and former enemies such as Sebastian Shaw, to help build the foundations of their nation and help secure international recognition of Krakoa as a mutant state. With the foundations set, Xavier extended a telepathic invitation to all of mutantkind, regardless of their past crimes, offering sanctuary on Krakoa.[122]\n\nPrior to the first meeting of Krakoa's new ruling body, the Quiet Council, Professor X and Magneto revealed to Moira the new council members. When they told her they had promised Mystique they would resurrect her dead wife Destiny in exchange for her taking a seat on the Council, Moira warned them against it, telling them there could be no pre-cogs on Krakoa because they would learn the truth; that in all of Moira's many lives, mutantkind always loses. Xavier and Magneto tried to assuage her fears, telling her that things would be different because now, they were different.[48]\n\nDawn of X[]\n\nWhile peace reigns on Krakoa, a mysterious team of assassins named XENO dropped onto the island and assassinated Xavier.[23] His death was brief as he was quickly resurrected by the Five.[24] Xavier focused his efforts on consolidating Krakoa's many gains, both through continued diplomacy with mankind and through his work on the Quiet Council, approving the creation of several new mutant teams, chief among them a new X-Force in response to his assassination. [192] [193] [194]\n\nXavier and Krakoa faced their first serious challenge due to Apocalypse's efforts to reach Arakko, the island's other half, which had been swallowed by the demonic world of Amenth. Apocalypse managed to establish a path to the demonic world through Otherworld, despite the disapproval of Xavier and the Quiet Council, but was shocked to learn that Arakko had already fallen under the control of Annihilation and its demonic horde. With all of Earth threatened, the Krakoans and Arakki agreed to settle their conflict through a tournament mediated by Saturnyne.[195]\n\nThe Krakoan champions won, freeing the Arakki from the grasp of Annihilation. However, this would result in Apocalypse joining his estranged wife Genesis in Amenth in exchange for Arakko being transported to Earth. During the final battle against Amenth, Jean Grey had chosen to depart the Quiet Council to reform the X-Men.[196]\n\nReign of X[]\n\nXavier and Magneto led diplomatic overtures with their Arakki counterparts, the Great Ring of Arakko. Finding that the warlike mutants of Arakko were ill suited to life on Earth, Magneto received the Quiet Council's support in terraforming Mars and creating a new home for the Arakki on the Red Planet. Mutantkind celebrated this great achievement with the first Hellfire Gala.[197]\n\nXavier was also reunited with his son, Legion. Legion had been captured by Orchis and was freed in death by Nightcrawler. Despite Legion's resurrection, Xavier initially refused to restore his mind to his shell, afraid that his son was simply too unstable to be allowed on the island. To his shock, Legion was able to restore his mind on his own, fully aware that his father had rejected him, further straining their already damaged relationship.[198]\n\nXavier attempted to connect with his son, but found him distant as Legion focused his efforts on finding a mysterious entity that was plaguing Krakoa.[198] This entity was revealed to be Onslaught. Overwhelming and seizing control of both Xavier and Magneto, Onslaught nearly destroyed Krakoa but was stopped in no small part due to Legion's efforts.[199]\n\nInferno[]\n\nDespite their best efforts, the Krakoans failed to prevent the emergence of Nimrod.[200] With an existential conflict with the Sentinels imminent, and with their grasp over Krakoa slipping, Xavier and Magneto sought out Moira's counsel. Moira meanwhile had begun to lose hope in this timeline. This was further exacerbated when Mystique, having grown tired of Xavier and Magneto lying to her about resurrecting Destiny, engineered her dead wife's resurrection on her own, and managed to win her a place on the Quiet Council.[201]\n\nMoira flatly rejected Xavier and Magneto's ideas about allying with the machines, and instead encouraged them to re-assert control over the Quiet Council. The trio reached out to Emma Frost, allowing her to read Moira's mind and bringing her into their cabal. In addition to this, they filled the final vacant seat on the council with Colossus, believing he would be loyal to their vision, unaware that Colossus' mind was no longer his own and that he was being controlled by his brother.[201]\n\nThe trio had made a mistake in reaching out to Emma, as she was furious over Xavier and Magneto having kept her in the dark for so long. She revealed the truth about Moira to Mystique and Destiny, encouraging them to put an end to Moira before she could reset the timeline once more. Mystique and Destiny managed to capture Moira, luring Xavier and Magneto to an Orchis base. Here, the pair faced Nimrod and Omega Sentinel in combat. They nearly defeated them, but due to Nimrod's duplicity Xavier and Magneto were killed.[202]\n\nMoira meanwhile was de-powered by Destiny and Mystique, and revealed that she had given up hope for this timeline, now planning to de-power all of mutantkind in the hope that it would at least spare their lives. Before Destiny and Mystique could kill her, Cypher intervened, forcing them to spare her life. As Xavier and Magneto were resurrected, Emma revealed the truth of Moira to the rest of the Quiet Council.[203]\n\nDestiny of X[]\n\nWith Moria having turned against them and now reborn as a machine allied to Orchis, Xavier was forced to contend with his failures. This was made worse when Magneto, his will broken by recent events, announced that he would leave the Quiet Council and Krakoa to retire to Arakko. He was replaced on the council with Hope Summers.[204]\n\nWhen Omega Red fell under the sway of Mikhail Rasputin and was convinced he had been betrayed by the Krakoans, he embarked on a quest through time to kill Xavier. He was opposed in this by Wolverine, whose consciousness was sent through time by Jean Grey to defend the Professor.[205]\n\nKrakoa was soon embroiled in a new war, this time against the Eternals due to political machinations by their leader Druig. The war was complicated by the creation of the Progenitor, a new Celestial which decided to judge Earth and its people.[206] [207] Xavier was judged and failed by the Celestial, a fact he did not even notice as he was busy waging telepathic war against the Eternal Uni-Mind.[29] With Druig soon replaced by Eros, the Eternals, mutants and Avengers united and managed to put an end to the Progenitor and save the world.[208]\n\nHowever, the true threat to Krakoa would come from within. Sebastian Shaw had by now begun to doubt Krakoa and made plans to ensure that he came out on top when Krakoa inevitably fell.[209] This paled however in comparison to the schemes of Mr. Sinister. After learning of Moira's mutant nature, Sinister had immediately begun cloning her, creating the Moira Engine. The Moira Engine allowed Sinister to essentially create \"save points\" in time, allowing him to replay events over and over to ensure that he came out on top. Sinister's plan was to seize control of not only Krakoa, but the entire world.[30]\n\nAfter several attempts, Sinister succeeded in his plans, causing Xavier, Emma Frost, Hope Summers and Exodus to be reborn as modified clones of Sinister, maintaining their original personalities but corrupted by his genes. They embarked on an ambitious plan to seize control of the world and make everyone Sinister. When the clones inevitably turned on their master, Sinister himself was enslaved by his creations.[210] [211] For a thousand years, the corrupted mutants, Xavier among them, wreaked untold havoc on the known universe.\n\nThe original Sinister managed to reestablish control over his experiment a thousand years into the future, sacrificing every corrupted mutant in an attempt to become a Dominion, a godlike A.I. existing outside of time and space. Sinister failed in his attempt as he was blocked by another.[31] With this timeline undone, Xavier and the other corrupted members of the Quiet Council were purged of Sinister's influence while he was imprisoned in the Pit due to intervention by Rasputin IV, sent back from the Sinister future to stop her creator.[212]\n\nFall of X[]\n\nWith many cracks now emerging throughout Krakoa, the mutant nation's third and final Hellfire Gala would spell the beginning of the end. Having hacked the Krakoan medicines, Orchis gained the ability to kill any human who had taken the drugs without a trace. They launched an all-out attack on the Hellfire Gala, luring away the Avengers to ensure that the X-Men would face them alone, successfully murdering several key mutants.\n\nWith their victory seemingly secured, Orchis blackmailed Xavier into banishing every mutant from Earth to Arakko, which was embroiled in a civil war partly engineered by Orchis. Unwilling to watch Orchis kill innocent humans, Xavier complied, with only those mutants with the tools to break a forced telepathic command capable of resisting the order. Xavier was narrowly saved from being murdered by Moira when Rogue intervened, but upon realizing that he could not sense any of the mutants who had left Earth, Xavier was convinced that Orchis had tricked him into murdering all of them. Broken by this realization, he ordered Rogue to drop him on Krakoa, which was now abandoned.[213]\n\nXavier lost all hope after the fall of Krakoa, wandering the island in a haze and only expending effort to scare away any Orchis soldiers who dared defile the island. He soon realized however that he was not alone in his mind. Due to the experiments Sinister had conducted on Xavier as a child, his essence had survived the purge that had been successful on the other infected members of the Quiet Council. Now, Sinister began piloting Xavier's body while he slept, working on a way to destroy the Enigma, a dominion created by the original Nathaniel Essex.[214] [215]\n\nSinister managed to convince Xavier to agree to a détente, as the two began working together on an ambitious plan to stop Enigma, a nearly impossible prospect as the godlike dominion existed outside of time and space, and was thus aware of everything they did. The Enigma had used four clones of Nathaniel Essex, one among them Sinister, to ascend to dominionhood in various timelines made possible by Sinister's Moira Engine. With Sinister reborn in a cloned body of Cypher, the pair recruited Askani and Rasputin IV to help them in their plan, as they hid from Enigma in a No-Place. Xavier was relieved to learn that the mutants who had fled the Hellfire Gala were not dead, but had instead been transported to the White Hot Room. [216] [217]\n\nTheir first plan was for Rasputin to undo the four clones' ascensions to dominionhood, thus hopefully preventing Enigma from coming into existance. This failed, prompting the pair to hatch a new plan; for Xavier to travel back to before Moira's powers first manifested and kill her, preventing her genes from being used to create the Moira Engine and preventing Enigma's ascension that way. When Askani and Rasputin learned of Sinister's involvement and Xavier's new plan, they tried to stop him. Askani was able to narrowly stop Xavier from shooting Moira by sharing the thoughts of her X-Men, who explained the importance of not erasing Krakoa from the timeline.[218] Xavier relented, implanting a telepathic message into Moira's mind to be activated in the future, and instead turning to another, more unlikely plan; resurrecting the Phoenix Force, which was one of few entities powerful enough to destroy Enigma.[218]\n\nDespite the fact that the X-Men had rallied and were pushing Orchis back, Xavier was desperate to complete the plan and stop Enigma. To that end, he made an offer to Orchis, now wholly controlled by Nimrod and the machines, asking them to spare mutantkind on Krakoa in exchange for his help in realizing their plans and pacifying the X-Men. As a test of loyalty he thwarted a nuclear attack by the USA. However, despite looking like he had killed the crew of the nuclear vessel in the process, Xavier had in fact created cloned humans using Sinister's knowledge, in order to avoid innocent lives being lost[219]. Despite the bodies being fakes, the world at large believed Xavier to be a murderer.[220]\n\nThe living X-Men succeeded in destroying Nimrod and the Sentinels, while those in the White Hot Room successfully resurrected the Phoenix. Still in Orchis headquarters, Xavier and Moira came face to face once again. Xavier revealed to her that he had joined Orchis in order to find his way to her, knowing she would ally with Enigma. He convinced her to activate the signal in her brain placed by the time-traveling Xavier when she was 13, which would allow the Phoenix to find and destroy Enigma, at the cost of her own life. Xavier's plan worked, and Enigma's threat was ended.[221]\n\nAfter taking a week to himself to say goodbye, he surrendered to human justice for the crimes he had committed while feigning allegiance to Orchis."
