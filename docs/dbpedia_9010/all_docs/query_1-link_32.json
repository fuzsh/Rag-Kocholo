        "text": "Nicknamed \"Ascending Ice Phoenix\", she doesn't hesitate to put her life on the line to save the Drifting Flower Edifices from Yan Song.\n\nUnlike Zhuo Fan or the other elders, she had never been seen speaking arrogantly to anyone and is considered extremely polite.\n\nHowever, even she can lose her composure. Huangpu Qianyun's betrayal proved that she can indeed hold grudges.\n\nRelationship with Zhuo Fan\n\nChu Qingcheng first met Zhuo Fan in a deserted town near the Drifting Flower Edifices. At that time, Zhuo Fan was disguised as Song Yu. At first, Chu Qingcheng was aloof towards him, but she gradually softened when he reminded her of her deceased younger brother, Chu Qingtian. Distressed by the approaching doom of Drifting Flower Edifices, Chu Qingcheng secretly married Zhuo Fan (without his knowledge), and spent a few days of solace with him in the broken hut. She was angry when Huangpu Qingyun attacked them and declared that she was willing to be with Zhuo Fan.\n\nLater, on behalf of Drifting Flower Edifices, Zhuo Fan suddenly participated in the Hundred Pill Festival. Wearing the cloak of Chu Qingtian, Zhuo Fan challenged Yan Song of Pill King Hall. Chu Qingcheng came to know from Xie Tianyang and Long Jie that Song Yu was actually an imposter. Chu Qingcheng fell in love with Zhuo Fan when he used his otherworldly skills to utterly defeat Yan Song and single handedly saved the Drifting Flower Edifices. However, she was heartbroken when Zhuo Fan left without a word and renounced all relations with her. Nevertheless, she couldn't stop pining for him for the next five years.\n\nFive years later, she met Zhuo Fan and was jealous of the other ladies fawning over him. Chu Qingcheng was hurt when Zhuo Fan didn't return her feelings. Another few years later, Zhuo Fan and Chu Qingcheng were formally married, where he expressed his immense love for her. Towards the end, once Zhuo Fan attains above the highest cultivation, he erases his existence from the memories of all people in this world. Even then, Chu Qingcheng is able to retain all her memories of him. At the end of the story, the couple is happily reunited.\n\nMemories of shared moments with Zhuo Fan came back.\n\nLooking at the sky quietly, Chu Qingcheng prayed devoutly, not moving, watching the silver light flashing in her eyes, but there were strange rays of light flashing, one after another memory fragments, one after another appeared in front of her : \"Sister Yunshang, I seem to remember the past. It turns out that we have been together in Mortal Rank!\"\n\n\"The world is going to be destroyed, what's the use of thinking of it?\" Luo Yunchang reluctantly shook her head with a light sigh.\n\nThe corner of her mouth grinned, Chu Qingcheng smiled suddenly, so happy and happy: \"Of course it works, even if life and death is boundless, but the love remains the same. I have been looking for him in Mortal Rank for so long, and he has been looking for me for so long in Saint Territory. It turns out that if I passed away, he will also find me. As long as I know this, even if there is only one minute to remember all this, it is enough...\"\n\nAppearance\n\n[First Appearance - Mortal Domain]\n\nHer face is always veiled in accordance to Drifting Flower Edifices' rule, otherwise she has to step down from her position. Chu Qingcheng is considered the most beautiful woman in Tianyu.\n\nHer beauty is stunning enough to capture Zhuo Fan's eyes and caused him to lose focus. She is pretty confident that 9 out of 9 men would be dumbfounded from her beauty, and is offended when Zhuo Fan is eager to ignore her.\n\nHer perfect physique with slender limbs and white marble skin painted her as a delicate crystal, worthy of protecting with one's life.\n\n[Second Appearance after reincarnation in Sacred Domain]\n\n\"This girl has a rather ordinary face, not peerless, but it can be called delicate, pretty and clean.\"\n\nLooks like she's in her 20's. Has light purple hair with pink accent.\n\nBackground\n\nShe was made the Head of Drifting Flower Edifices by Chu Bijun, her master, after the latter was inflicted by Pill King Hall's Rainbow Cloud Palm.\n\nQuote\n\n\"She is my wife and I love her.” -Zhou Fan\n\nDied as she tried absorbing Zhuo Fan's Uncontrollable World Extinction Thunder Flame.\n\nReincarnated into the Holy Land/Sanctuary.\n\nCultivation\n\nRealm Layer Novel Manhua Heavenly Profound 3 106 (mentioned) start 8 246 (mentioned) 287 Radiant Stage 8 610 (mentioned) Virtual Realm 1 834 Virtual Realm 5 1100 (mentioned) Genesis Realm 7 1189 (mentioned) ?? ? 1315 (it's known that she waited and cultivated for 1000 years. Although her progress wasn't told, she certainly became stronger.)\n\nSkills and Power\n\nLegendary Void Spirit Physique - It can transform various energies into an ethereal state without rejection. It is the best Dual Cultivation furnace cauldron in the world. When the martial skill is the hardest to master, you can also adjust yin and yang to quickly become a teammate like a god. There is a special technique \"array pattern of life-for-life\" that only legendary Void Spirit Physique holders can use, where you can sacrifice your life to save the life of one chosen person. In Mortal World, only Chu Qingcheng has Legendary Void Spirit Physique. Besides her, Heavenly Emperor also has this physique. Because of this, he was able to suppress and control his power (heavenly eyes).\n\nPlot\n\nShe is a woman in whose heart there are many very difficult matters. Her life and members of Drifting Flower Edifices were threatened with poison. She was the head of one of the 7 largest families in the Tianyu Empire. In addition, her family was the weakest among the seven. She had to defend herself against attacks from external forces (Regent Estate and others), who wanted to steal the Bodhi Jade Root, the treasure of Drifting Flower Edifices. She carried a grudge from the death of her brother. She carried all these problems in her heart for many years, and despite the fact that she had several trusted sisters, she had no one strong with whom she could go with for a moment of rest.
