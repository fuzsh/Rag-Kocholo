In 324, he defeated the eastern Augustus Licinius and re-united the empire under his rule, reigning as sole emperor until his death. Constantine completed the administrative and military reforms begun under Diocletian, who had begun ushering in the Dominate period. Actively interested in Christianity, he played a crucial role in its development and the Christianization of the Roman world, through his convocation of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea. He is said to have received baptism on his deathbed. He also reformed coinage through the introduction of the gold solidus, and initiated a large-scale building program, crowned by the re-foundation the city of Byzantium as \"New Rome\", popularly known as Constantinople. He was regarded as the model of all subsequent Byzantine emperors.[5] Constantius II\n\nΚωνστάντιος\n\nFl. Iulius Constantius 22 May 337 –\n\n3 November 361\n\n(24 years, 1 month and 25 days)\n\nBorn on 7 August 317, as the second surviving son of Constantine I, he inherited the eastern third of Roman Empire upon his father's death, sole Roman Emperor from 353, after the overthrow of the western usurper Magnentius. Constantius' reign saw military activity on all frontiers, and dissension between Arianism, favoured by the emperor, and the \"Orthodox\" supporters of the Nicene Creed. In his reign, Constantinople was accorded equal status to Rome, and the original Hagia Sophia was built. Constantius appointed Constantius Gallus and Julian as Caesares, and died on his way to confront Julian, who had risen up against him.[6] Julian \"the Apostate\"\n\nἸουλιανὸς ὁ Ἀποστάτης\n\nFl. Claudius Iulianus 3 November 361 –\n\n26 June 363\n\n(1 year, 7 months and 23 days)\n\nBorn in May 332, grandson of Constantius Chlorus and cousin of Constantius II.

Emperor of the West, he inherited rule of the East upon the death of Valens and appointed Theodosius I as Emperor of the East. Assassinated on 25 August 383 during the rebellion of Magnus Maximus.\n\nTheodosian dynasty (379–457)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Theodosian dynasty\n\nTheodosius I\n\n\"the Great\"\n\nΘεοδόσιος ὁ Μέγας 19 January 379 –\n\n17 January 395\n\n(15 years, 11 months and 29 days)\n\nBorn on 11 January 347, in Spain.

On the death of Theodosius I in 395, the Roman Empire was permanently divided between the Eastern Roman Empire, later referred to as the Byzantine Empire, and the Western Roman Empire. Theodosius' eldest son Arcadius became emperor in the East while his younger son Honorius became emperor in the West. Theodosius II\n\nΘεοδόσιος 1 May 408 –\n\n28 July 450\n\n(42 years, 2 months and 27 days)\n\nBorn on 10 April 401, the only son of Arcadius; proclaimed Augustus on 10 January 402.

A soldier and politician, he became emperor after being wed by the Augusta Pulcheria, sister of Theodosius II, following the latter's death. Died of gangrene.\n\nLeonid dynasty (457–518)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Leonid dynasty\n\nLeo I \"the Great\" and \"the Butcher\"\n\nΛέων ὁ Μέγας / Μακέλλης 7 February 457 –\n\n18 January 474\n\n(16 years, 11 months and 11 days)\n\nBorn in Dacia c. 400, and of Bessian origin, Leo became a low-ranking officer and served as an attendant of the Gothic magister militum, Aspar, who chose him as emperor on Marcian's death. He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and the first one to legislate in Greek.[7] His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube and peace with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the West, supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an expedition to recover Carthage from the Vandals in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the Isaurians as a counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian leader Tarasicodissa (Zeno). With their support, in 471 Aspar was murdered and Gothic power over the army was broken.[8] Leo II \"the Little\"\n\nΛέων ὁ μικρός 18 January –\n\nNovember 474\n\n(10 months)\n\nBorn 468, he was the grandson of Leo I by Leo's daughter Ariadne and her Isaurian husband, Zeno. He was raised to Augustus on 17 November 473. Leo ascended the throne after the death of his grandfather on 18 January 474. He crowned his father as co-emperor and effective regent on 29 January, dying shortly after. Zeno\n\nΖήνων (Ταρασικοδίσσας) 29 January 474 –\n\n9 January 475\n\n(11 months and 11 days)\n\nAugust 476 –\n\n9 April 491 (14 years and 8 months)\n\nBorn c. 425 in Isauria, originally named Tarasicodissa. As the leader of Leo I's Isaurian soldiers, he rose to comes domesticorum, married the emperor's daughter Ariadne and took the name Zeno, and played a crucial role in the elimination of Aspar and his Goths. He was named co-emperor by his son on 29 January 474 and became sole ruler upon the latter's death, but had to flee to his native country before Basiliscus in 475, regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the Vandals, saw off challenges against him by Illus and Verina, and secured peace in the Balkans by enticing the Ostrogoths under Theodoric the Great to migrate to Italy. Zeno's reign also saw the end of the western line of emperors. His pro-Monophysite stance made him unpopular and his promulgation of the Henotikon resulted in the Acacian Schism with the papacy.[9] Basiliscus\n\nΒασιλίσκος 9 January 475 –\n\nAugust 476\n\n(1 year and 7 months)\n\nGeneral and brother-in-law of Leo I, seized power from Zeno and crowned himself emperor on 12 January.

He was nicknamed \"Dikoros\" (Latin: Dicorus), because of his heterochromia. Anastasius reformed the tax system and the Byzantine coinage and proved a frugal ruler, so that by the end of his reign he left a substantial surplus. His Monophysite sympathies led to widespread opposition, most notably the Revolt of Vitalian and the Acacian Schism. His reign was also marked by the first Bulgar raids into the Balkans and by a war with Persia over the foundation of Dara. He died childless.[10]\n\nJustinian dynasty (518–602)\n\n[edit]\n\nJustin I\n\nἸουστῖνος, Iustinus 9 July 518 –\n\n1 August 527\n\n(9 years and 23 days)\n\nBorn c. 450 at Bederiana (Justiniana Prima), Dardania.

His early reign was dominated by successive regencies, first by his mother, Zoe Karbonopsina, and Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos, and from 919 by the admiral Romanos Lekapenos, who wedded his daughter to Constantine and was crowned senior emperor in 920. Constantine re-asserted his control by deposing Romanos's sons on 27 January 945. His reign was marked by struggles with Sayf al-Dawla in the East and an unsuccessful campaign against Crete, and pro-aristocratic policies that saw a partial reversal of Lekapenos' legislation against the dynatoi. He is notable for his promotion of the \"Macedonian Renaissance\", sponsoring encyclopaedic works and histories. He was a prolific writer himself, best remembered for the manuals on statecraft (De administrando imperio) and ceremonies (De ceremoniis) he compiled for his son.[13] Romanos I Lekapenos\n\nῬωμανὸς Λεκαπηνός 17 December 920 –\n\n20 December 944\n\n(24 years and 3 days)\n\nAn admiral of lowly origin, Romanos rose to power as a protector of the young Constantine VII against the general Leo Phokas the Elder. After becoming the emperor's father-in-law, he successively assumed higher offices until he crowned himself senior emperor. His reign was marked by the end of warfare with Bulgaria and the great conquests of John Kourkouas in the East. Romanos promoted his sons Stephen and Constantine (alongside Christopher, who died soon after) as co-emperors over Constantine VII, but was himself overthrown by them and confined to an island as a monk. He died there on 15 June 948.

After the death of Romanos II, he rose to the throne with the support of the army and people as regent for the young emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII, marrying the empress-dowager Theophano. Throughout his reign he led campaigns in the East, conquering much of Syria. He was murdered by his nephew and one-time associate John Tzimiskes.

The first decade of his reign was marked by rivalry with the powerful Basil Lekapenos, an unsuccessful war against Bulgaria, and rebellions by generals in Asia Minor. Basil solidified his position through a marriage alliance with Vladimir I of Kiev, and after suppressing the revolts, he embarked on his conquest of Bulgaria. Bulgaria was finally subdued in 1018 after over 20 years of war, interrupted only by sporadic warfare in Syria against the Fatimid Caliphate. Basil also expanded Byzantine control over most of Armenia. His reign is widely considered as the apogee of medieval Byzantium.

During the rule of Basil II, he spent his time in idle pleasure. During his short reign he was an indifferent ruler, easily influenced by his courtiers and suspicious of plots to depose him, especially among the military aristocracy, many of whom were blinded and exiled.[14] Romanos III Argyros\n\nῬωμανὸς Ἀργυρός 15 November 1028 –\n\n11 April 1034\n\n(5 years, 4 months and 30 days)\n\nBorn in 968, the elderly aristocrat Romanos was chosen by Constantine VIII on his deathbed as Zoe's husband and succeeded on the throne after Constantine's death a few days later.

He died after a long illness. Michael V \"the Caulker\"\n\nΜιχαὴλ ὁ Καλαφάτης 10 December 1041 –\n\n20 April 1042\n\n(4 months and 8 days)\n\nBorn in 1015, he was the nephew and adopted son of Michael IV.

He was deposed the next day, castrated and tonsured, dying on 24 August 1042.

Constantine IX Monomachos\n\nΚωνσταντῖνος Μονομάχος 12 June 1042 –\n\n11 January 1055\n\n(12 years, 6 months and 30 days)\n\nBorn c. 1000 of noble origin, he had an undistinguished life but was exiled to Lesbos by Michael IV, returning when he was chosen as Zoe's third husband. Constantine supported the mercantile classes and favoured the company of intellectuals, thereby alienating the military aristocracy. A pleasure-loving ruler, he lived an extravagant life with his favourite mistresses and endowed a number of monasteries, chiefly the Nea Moni of Chios and the Mangana Monastery. His reign was marked by invasions by the Pechenegs in the Balkans and the Seljuk Turks in the East, the revolts of George Maniakes and Leo Tornikios, and the Great Schism between the patriarchates of Rome and Constantinople.[15]\n\nNon-dynastic (1056–1057)\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael VI Bringas\n\n\"Stratiotikos\" / \"the Old\"\n\nΜιχαὴλ Βρίγγας ὁ Στρατιωτικός/ὁ Γέρων 31 August 1056 –\n\n30/31 August 1057\n\n(1 year and 8 days)\n\nA court bureaucrat and stratiotikos logothetes (hence his first sobriquet).
