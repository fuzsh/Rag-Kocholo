        "text": "21st August >> Fr. Martin's Reflections/Homilies on Today's Mass Readings for Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time (Inc. Matthew 20:1-16): ‘Why be envious because I am generous?’\n\nWednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nGospel (Except USA) Matthew 20:1-16 Why be envious because I am generous?\n\nJesus said to his disciples: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner going out at daybreak to hire workers for his vineyard. He made an agreement with the workers for one denarius a day, and sent them to his vineyard. Going out at about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place and said to them, “You go to my vineyard too and I will give you a fair wage.” So they went. At about the sixth hour and again at about the ninth hour, he went out and did the same. Then at about the eleventh hour he went out and found more men standing round, and he said to them, “Why have you been standing here idle all day?” “Because no one has hired us” they answered. He said to them, “You go into my vineyard too.” In the evening, the owner of the vineyard said to his bailiff, “Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last arrivals and ending with the first.” So those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came forward and received one denarius each. When the first came, they expected to get more, but they too received one denarius each. They took it, but grumbled at the landowner. “The men who came last” they said “have done only one hour, and you have treated them the same as us, though we have done a heavy day’s work in all the heat.” He answered one of them and said, “My friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on one denarius? Take your earnings and go. I choose to pay the last comer as much as I pay you. Have I no right to do what I like with my own? Why be envious because I am generous?” Thus the last will be first, and the first, last.’\n\nGospel (USA) Matthew 20:1-16 Are you envious because I am generous?\n\nJesus told his disciples this parable: “The Kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. Going out about nine o’clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and he said to them, ‘You too go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is just.’ So they went off. And he went out again around noon, and around three o’clock, and did likewise. Going out about five o’clock, he found others standing around, and said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ They answered, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You too go into my vineyard.’ When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.’ When those who had started about five o’clock came, each received the usual daily wage. So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage. And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner, saying, ‘These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the day’s burden and the heat.’ He said to one of them in reply, ‘My friend, I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage? Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you? Or am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am generous?’ Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last.”\n\nReflections (9)\n\n(i) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn a prayer to God, Saint Augustine once said, ‘Late have I loved you, Beauty ever ancient and ever new’. Compared to others, he came to God late in life. He was one of the latecomers, like those in today’s parable who worked only for the last hour of the working day. Yet, God was as generous with Augustine as he had been with those who came to faith much earlier in life. Augustine had an overwhelming sense of God’s gracious and merciful love for him. The parable Jesus speaks upsets a lot of people, because it seems that those who worked all day were treated unfairly, receiving the same wage as those who only worked for the last hour. Yet, as the landowner says in the parable, he has given those who worked all day the wage that was agreed, which was a just wage, because a denarius was considered a day’s wage at the time. The landowner wasn’t unjust to those who worked all day. He was just extremely generous to those who worked for much less than the full working day. He gave everyone a day’s wage, a living wage, so that they could feed their families. He didn’t work on the basis of strict justice. His generous nature exploded the boundaries of strict justice. In this parable Jesus was saying something to us about God. It is in God’s nature to be extremely generous with us, whether we have strictly deserved it or not. God’s ways are not our ways. God is like the father in the parable of the prodigal son who threw a feast for his rebellious son who came home very late indeed. This is good news to rejoice in, rather than disturbing news to be upset by. Saint Paul expresses this good news in his own way, ‘For by grace you have been saved, through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God – not the result of works, so that no one may boast’ (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ii) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nMost of us react instinctively against any form of behaviour that we consider to be unfair or unjust. If we think we are being treated unfairly, unjustly, we can feel especially irate. It is probably that instinct in us that leaves us feeling a bit uneasy about the story that Jesus tells in this morning’s gospel reading. We can easily sympathize with the complaint of the workers who bemoan the fact that those who only worked an hour got the same wages as those who worked all day. Yet, whereas those workers were operating out of the category of justice, the employer was operating out of the category of generosity. He wasn’t unjust to those who worked all day; he paid them what he agreed with them. He was simple extremely generous to those who only worked an hour. Perhaps Jesus was saying to us through this parable that God’s generosity cannot be contained within the categories of human justice; it explodes those categories. God does not deal with us according to our efforts, on the basis of what we deserve. There is nothing calculating about God’s generosity. Perhaps we are all encouraged to identify with those who worked only an hour; we are all, in a sense, latecomers. The parable assures us that God’s generosity will surprise us and leave us humbled.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iii) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThis is one of the parables of Jesus that people often react negatively to. There is a feeling that the workers who worked all done were hard done by because those who worked for the last hour were given the same wage. However, in the world of the story, the employer did not treat those who worked all day unjustly; he gave them a day’s wages for a day’s work. The surprise in the story is that the employer was exceptionally generous with those who worked for an hour, giving them a day’s wages as well. No injustice was done to anyone, but some of the workers were the recipients of a surprising and extravagant generosity. Just began this parable, with the phrase, ‘the kingdom of heaven is like...’ The world of God is reflected in the world of the story; the character of the employer reflects God in some way. Jesus appears to be saying that God’s generosity will always take us by surprise. God’s way of dealing with us breaks the bounds of what humans would consider just and fair. What God does for us far exceeds what we might do for God. God does not relate to us on the basis of what we have earned or deserved. God’s generous love is pure gift; it is not a reward for labour rendered. We serve the Lord from one end of the day to the other not to gain or earn his love but in grateful response for the love already given to us long before we could do anything.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iv) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nSometimes in the parables that Jesus speaks people behave in ways that others would find surprising or even foolish. The behaviour of the father in the parable of the prodigal son comes to mind. He gave an extraordinary welcome to a son who had done nothing to deserve it. The reaction of his older brother in the story is in keeping with how many people would have reacted if that had happened in real life. This morning’s parable of the workers in the vineyard is a little bit like that parable. The behaviour of the owner of the vineyard would have been considered very strange and even foolish in Jesus’ time; he gave a day’s wages to workers who only worked one hour. Many people tend to react to the parable somewhat negatively even today. Just as we often feel sorry for the elder son in the parable of the prodigal son, we tend to feel sorry for the workers who worked all day and yet got the same as those who worked for an hour. Yet, the workers who worked all day got a day’s wages for their work, which is what the vineyard owner promised them. What is strange and unsettling is that those who worked for only an hour also got a day’s wages. Jesus began this parable with the words, ‘the kingdom of heaven is like...’ The parable is saying something about how God relates to us. Jesus is saying that God is extraordinarily generous. There is nothing calculating about how God relates to us. God’s giving is not dependant on our doing. There can come a time in our lives when, for one reason or another, we can’t do a great deal. Jesus seems to be saying that this has no impact on how God relates to us. God does not ask us to be deserving but to be receptive, and then to share what we receive from him with each other.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(v) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nMost of us when we hear that parable identify with the complaint of those who worked all day in the heat of the sun and, yet, end up getting the same amount as those who work for the last hour of the working day when it was much cooler. It offends our sense of justice. The employment culture today would hold strongly to the principle of equal pay for equal work and no one could dispute that principle. That was also the understood way of proceeding in the time of Jesus. Jesus must have known then that this parable would be provocative and that his hearers were likely to identify strongly with the complaint of those who worked all day. What, then, was Jesus at? He may have wanted to get across that God’s justice is of a different order to human justice. God does not give in exact proportion to what we have earned. His giving breaks the bounds of human justice. His generosity cannot be contained by human categories of justice. The question that concludes the parable suggests as much, ‘Why be envious because I am generous?’ The landlord understood that the man who worked for the last hour was as much in need of a day’s wages to feed his family as those who worked all day. Jesus seems to be suggesting that God relates to us on basis of what we need rather than what we deserve. God’s favour, God’s gift of salvation, is, ultimately, an unmerited free gift. This is good news for all of us. At the end of our lives, and throughout our lives, we can entrust ourselves to the Lord’s generosity, knowing that it will exceed all our expectations.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vi) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe reaction of the workers to the landowner’s very generous treatment of the men who worked for only the last hour of the working day reminds me of the reaction of the older son in the parable of the prodigal son to his father’s very generous treatment of his younger son. In both parables the reaction is one of righteous indignation that someone was receiving far more than they deserved. The younger son had wasted his father’s property in a self-indulgent lifestyle and yet he was treated like the lord of the manor. The last group of workers had only worked one hour and yet they were given a whole day’s wages. In both parables we find it easy to identify with the reaction of the older son and the reaction of those who did a heavy day’s work in all the heat. Somehow both parables seem to offend our sense of justice, our feel for what is fair. The father in the first parable was extremely generous towards his wayward son; the landowner in this morning’s parable is extremely generous towards the men who worked only one hour. There is a quality of generosity and mercy here that seems to shatter our sense of justice. Yet, this is precisely the message of these parables. God’s generosity, God’s mercy, is not simply a bigger version of human generosity and mercy. It has a completely different quality, one that leaves us scratching our heads. At the end of the day that is good news for us all.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vii) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nToday’s gospel reading contains one of those parables of Jesus that leave us feeling a little uneasy. The complaint of those who worked for the whole day in the vineyard seems very reasonable to us, ‘you have treated those who only worked one hour the same as us’. This certainly doesn’t correspond to modern employment practice. It would be unheard of for two people doing the same work to be paid the same wage if one worked all day and the other worked for one hour. Such practice would have been just as unacceptable in the time and place of Jesus. Jesus must have known that his parable would leave people feeling uncomfortable. This is not the way the world works. Perhaps that is the very point of the parable. Life within God’s kingdom does not work as the world does. The parable ends with the vineyard owner’s question, ‘Why be envious because I am generous?’ It is a question that goes to the heart of the parable’s meaning. Jesus is declaring that God is generous in a way that goes way beyond the norms of human justice. God’s way of relating to us is not based on human merit. Jesus reveals God to be someone whose boundless mercy and generosity can appear scandalous to many, including those who thought of themselves as religious. This is the God revealed by the father in the parable of the prodigal son. The son did not deserve the welcome he received, no more than those who worked an hour deserved a day’s wages. Jesus declares that God does not treat us on the basis of what we deserve. God’s favour is freely bestowed on those who are unworthy of it. It is an unmerited free gift. We are called to receive this gift in all humility and to allow this grace to shape our lives. We are to freely give to others as we have freely received from the Lord.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(viii) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nSome of the parables of Jesus can be unsettling because they don’t seem to play by the rules that govern most human relationships. In the parable of the prodigal son, some wonder why the father was so generous towards someone who had shown himself a thoughtless and self-indulgent rebel. Many people have the same reaction to today’s parable. They grumble alongside the labourers in the parable who worked all day, asking why those who worked for one hour should be receiving the same payment as those who have borne the heat and burden of the entire working day. They feel as if those who worked all day have been unjustly treated. Yet, by means of this story, Jesus was perhaps showing that the God whom he called, ‘Father’, was not a God of strict justice, as humans normally understand it. God’s generous spirit was so great that it couldn’t be confined within the limits of strict human justice. In the parable the landowner gave a day’s wages to those who worked for a day; they received a just wage, the wage that had been agreed upon at the beginning of the day. However, the landowner chose to be exceptionally generous to the men who worked only an hour, giving them a day’s wage too. He chose to pay all the workers a living wage, even if they hadn’t earned it. Jesus reveals a God who wants to be as generous as possible with the gift of salvation, the gift of life. God does not relate to us on the basis of what we have earned or deserved. God relates to us out of a generosity which is more than human; God gives us life in abundance as a free gift. What we have done to earn it is not ultimately decisive. Rather than being disturbed by such a parable, it can be heard as good news for us all. God relates to us in this generous way to inspire us to be as generous in our dealings with each other as God is with us.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ix) Wednesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nWhen we read a story, like some of the parables of Jesus, we often identify with one of the characters in the story. Most people on hearing the parable in today’s gospel reading identify with the workers who worked from daybreak in the landowner’s vineyard, doing a day’s work and getting a day’s pay, which at the time was a denarius. We share their upset and annoyance when at the end of the day those who had worked three hours, six hours, nine hours, eleven hours, less than themselves received the same allowance, one denarius. Like the workers who had worked a full day’s work, we grumble at the unfairness of it all. Surely, a person’s pay should be in proportion to their work - less work, less pay, more work, more pay. Jesus must have known that this parable would disturb people’s sense of justice, so what was he getting at? Perhaps the key to the parable is to be found in the final statement of the landowner. He told the people who had worked all day that he had treated them justly, giving them a day’s wage for a day’s work. However, he had decided to give ever worker a day’s wage out of the goodness of his heart. Jesus was saying something to us about God here. God does not relate to us on the basis of strict justice. In that sense, God’s ways are nor our ways. God bestows his favour, his love, his mercy, on all, including on those who have done little to deserve it. God does not ask us to work for his love. God’s love is given freely to us all. What he asks is that we live out of that completely free gift, by loving others in the same lavish way that God has loved us. In the best of human relationships, love is freely bestowed; it doesn’t have to be earned or deserved. True human love, like God’s love, transcends the limits of strict justice.\n\nFr. Martin Hogan.\n\n20th August >> Fr. Martin's Reflections/Homilies on Today's Mass Readings for Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time (Inc. Matthew 19:23-30): ‘For God, everything is possible’.\n\nTuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nGospel (Except USA) Matthew 19:23-30 It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\nJesus said to his disciples, ‘I tell you solemnly, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Yes, I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.’ When the disciples heard this they were astonished. ‘Who can be saved, then?’ they said. Jesus gazed at them. ‘For men’ he told them ‘this is impossible; for God everything is possible.’ Then Peter spoke. ‘What about us?’ he said to him ‘We have left everything and followed you. What are we to have, then?’ Jesus said to him, ‘I tell you solemnly, when all is made new and the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you will yourselves sit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children or land for the sake of my name will be repaid a hundred times over, and also inherit eternal life. ‘Many who are first will be last, and the last, first.’\n\nGospel Matthew 19:23-30 It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.\n\nJesus said to his disciples: “Amen, I say to you, it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the Kingdom of heaven. Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the Kingdom of God.” When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “For men this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.” Then Peter said to him in reply, “We have given up everything and followed you. What will there be for us?” Jesus said to them, “Amen, I say to you that you who have followed me, in the new age, when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory, will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”\n\nReflections (7)\n\n(i) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nJesus’ image of a camel passing through the eye of a needle has been spoken of as an example of comic exaggeration. The person with the plank in their eye would be another example. Jesus often used such comic exaggerations to get people’s attention and perhaps to shock them out of a sense of complacency. When Jesus said to would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven, the astonished disciples ask, ‘Who can be saved, then?’ Jesus’ reply, ‘For people, this is impossible; for God everything is possible’, suggests that the attaining of salvation is primarily God’s doing rather than our doing. It is more God’s doing than our doing. We can only enter into the life of God with the help that God alone can give us. We need to depend fully on God to enter the kingdom of heaven, opening ourselves up in our poverty to his gracious working on our behalf. This is where Jesus sees the problem with excessive attachment to wealth or possessions. If we seek our security in wealth or possessions, we will cease to rely on God who alone gives access to salvation, to life in abundance. If we place our security in God, in the Lord, then, according to Jesus in today’s gospel reading, we will be abundantly repaid in this earthly life, and also inherit eternal life. We will find a joy that earthly goods can never give and we will be on the path to eternal joy, a sharing in the Lord’s own joy.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ii) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn yesterday’s gospel reading the rich young man found it impossible to follow Jesus because of his attachment to his possessions, in spite of his great desire to inherit eternal life. That is why Jesus goes on to say in this morning’s gospel reading, ‘it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of an needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of kingdom of heaven. This stark statement of Jesus left the disciples astonished and led them to ask the almost despairing question, ‘Who then can be saved?’ They seem to be saying, ‘it must be nearly impossible for anyone to enter the kingdom o heaven, not just that rich, good man who approached you’. Jesus cuts across their negative thinking with a very hopeful statement, ‘for men this is impossible; for God everything is possible’. Jesus is saying that arriving at our ultimate destiny is more God’s doing than our doing; it is due more to God’s grace than to our efforts. In the language of the letter to the Ephesians, God’s ‘power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine’. It is above all when we are low in ourselves and feel the journey is too much for us that we need to remind ourselves of this great truth. Saint Paul declared in a letter from prison, ‘I can do all things in him who gives me strength’. We need to keep putting our trust in the resources the Lord is always giving us and which we need so much.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iii) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nJesus is often depicted in the gospels as saying something that leaves his disciples astonished. What he said was often out of character with what the disciples would have heard from others. The gospel reading this morning gives us an example of the astonishment of the disciples at something Jesus said. The disciples were astonished because Jesus had said that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. The disciples’ very likely assumed that riches were a sign of God’s favour which is how they were often understood in the Jewish Scriptures. However, Jesus was aware that too many possessions can come to possess us, and become a kind of god. One of the sayings of Jesus in the gospels is, ‘You cannot serve God and mammon’. What the disciples saw as a blessing Jesus saw as a temptation and a danger. This insight of Jesus led the disciples to ask a kind of despairing question, ‘Who can be saved?’ They seem to be saying, ‘if those we thought blessed by God might not enter the kingdom of heaven, what about the rest of us?’ In response to his disciples’ despairing question, ‘Who can be saved?’ we have one of those sayings of Jesus which can give us great encouragement, ‘For God everything is possible’. Jesus seems to be saying that God can find a way of touching the hearts even of those who, like the rich young man, are possessed by their possessions. Jesus is declaring that God’s ability to draw us to himself cannot be underestimated. Even a small opening in our lives will be greatly exploited by God.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iv) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nAcross the four gospels, people ask Jesus a whole variety of questions. In the gospel reading this morning, in response to Jesus’ comment on how riches can be a block to entering the kingdom of heaven, the disciples ask the question, ‘Who can be saved?’ In that culture, riches were considered a sign of God’s favour. The disciples are wondering if the rich, those who have enjoyed God’s favour, struggle to get into the kingdom of heaven, what chance do others have of being saved? Jesus has a much more sanguine view of riches and possessions, than the disciples. He is more aware than they are that possessions can come between us and God, especially if we allow ourselves to be possessed by our possessions. If we belong completely to our possessions, whatever form those possessions take, then we cannot belong to God, and we will not be open to receive the gift of the kingdom. However, Jesus declares to his disciples that even though, in theory, it is not possible for those who are possessed by their possessions to enter the kingdom of heaven, everything is possible for God. God can enable even those who have no openness to him to enter the kingdom of heaven. The statement, ‘for God everything is possible’ is a very reassuring one. What is beyond what we can do is never beyond what God can do. This reassuring word does not make us complacent, but gives us hope when we find ourselves in situations which appear hopeless.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(v) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThere are a number of verses in the New Testament that I found myself going back to from time to time because they convey a great deal, at least to me. One of those verses occurs in today’s gospel reading, ‘For people this is impossible, for God everything is possible’. A somewhat similar saying occurs in Luke’s account of the annunciation where, in response to Mary’s question, ‘How can this be?’ Gabriel answers, ‘Nothing is impossible with God’. The context of the saying in today’s gospel reading is that of the rich young man who came to Jesus looking for the path to eternal life but went away sad because he was possessed by his possessions. How can such a rich man enter into eternal life? It is possible, Jesus declares, but only with God’s grace, God’s help. In our own lives we can sometimes find ourselves up against impossible odds. We wonder how we will get through some test, how we will keep going. In such circumstances, the saying in this morning’s gospel reading can be a great encouragement to us, ‘for God everything is possible’. Saint Paul knew the truth of that, and he expressed that truth in his inimitable way. In his letter to the Philippian, he declares, ‘I can do all things through him who gives me strength’. There are times when we all need to fall back on that conviction.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vi) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nJesus spoke the words in today’s gospel reading immediately after the scene where the rich man refused the call of Jesus to follow him because of his riches. Jesus goes on to say that attachment to wealth can hinder us from entering the kingdom of heaven. When possessions become our god, we no longer need to rely on the true God, the Father of Jesus. Jesus was aware that over reliance on our possessions can get in the way of our reliance on God. God can become superfluous, unnecessary. Yet, if we are to reach our ultimate goal of life in God’s kingdom, we desperately need God. That is very clear from the little exchange between Jesus and Peter in today’s gospel reading. In response to Peter’s question, ‘Who can be saved?’ Jesus answers ‘for men this is impossible, for God everything is possible’. It is only with God’s help that we can reach the goal God desires for us. In this matter, we are not self-sufficient; we rely on God throughout the whole course of our lives. We cannot afford to entrust ourselves to, put our reliance upon, anything less than God.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vii) Tuesday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nJesus uses many memorable images in the gospels and one is to be found in today’s gospel reading, that of a camel passing through the eye of a needle. Needles in the time of Jesus, as today, had a tiny opening and camels were very large animals. To say that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven is to say that a rich man entering the kingdom of heaven is impossible. The kind of rich man Jesus has in mind is one who is possessed by his possessions. There is a striking portrayal of such a person in one of the parables of Luke’s gospel, the parable of the rich fool as it is often called. When riches become someone’s god, they cease to be aware of the true God, the God whom Jesus proclaimed. Feeling satisfied with their material possessions, they fail to appreciate their need of God and are unresponsive to the gift of the kingdom that God is offering. We can only receive God’s gift of life in its fullness if we are aware of our need of that gift. If we don’t experience thirst, we will never drink. Elsewhere, Jesus speaks of the poor in spirit and declares that the kingdom of heaven belongs to such people. This is the attitude of coming before God in our need, in recognition of our dependence upon God. Jesus declares in the gospel reading that God can create this necessary attitude even in those to whom it seems foreign and impossible. When Peter asks, ‘Who can be saved, then?’ Jesus replies, ‘for men, this is impossible; for God everything is possible’. There are no hopeless cases from God’s perspective; God is always at work to create in us that poverty of spirit which creates the necessary opening for God to give us the riches of the gospel.\n\nFr.

Matthew 19:16-22): ‘What more do I need to do?’.\n\nMonday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nGospel (Except USA) Matthew 19:16-22 If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you own.\n\nThere was a man who came to Jesus and asked, ‘Master, what good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ Jesus said to him, ‘Why do you ask me about what is good? There is one alone who is good. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.’ He said, ‘Which?’ ‘These:’ Jesus replied ‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not bring false witness. Honour your father and mother, and: you must love your neighbour as yourself.’ The young man said to him, ‘I have kept all these. What more do I need to do?’ Jesus said, ‘If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.’ But when the young man heard these words he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth.\n\nGospel (USA) Matthew 19:16-22 If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and you will have treasure in heaven.\n\nA young man approached Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good must I do to gain eternal life?” He answered him, “Why do you ask me about the good? There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.” He asked him, “Which ones?” And Jesus replied, “You shall not kill; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness; honor your father and your mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.” The young man said to him, “All of these I have observed. What do I still lack?” Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” When the young man heard this statement, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.\n\nReflections (12)\n\n(i) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nToday’s gospel reading features a ‘young man’ who comes to Jesus. We always admire idealism in young people, and this young man was clearly striving for the ideal of a good life. He asked Jesus, ‘What good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ It is clear from his exchange with Jesus that he was already living a good living. He had kept the four commandments that Jesus quoted that had to do with relating to others, including the commandment found outside the ten commandments to love one’s neighbour as oneself. Yet, there was a longing in him for more, ‘What more do I need to do?’ We all experience something of that ‘more’ deep within us. We have a longing for God that moves us to live in ways that bring us ever closer to God. Jesus responded to the young man’s longer for more by calling him to become his close disciple, following him in the way that Peter, Andrew and others had done. That would have meant moving on from his great wealth, giving it to the poor, and this was a step too far for him. His inability to respond to the call of Jesus, to the deepest longing of his heart, left him sad. The Lord is always calling on us to take a further step that will bring us closer to his will for our lives, whether we are young or not so young. That step will be different for each one of us. We find our deepest joy in responding to the Lord’s call to grow in our relationship with him and in the living out of that relationship. The more generously we answer the Lord’s personal call, the happier we will be. We need the help of the Holy Spirit to give us the freedom to take the path the Lord may be calling us to take in response to that longing for ‘more’ in our lives.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ii) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThere is something appealing about the young man in today’s gospel reading. He was an earnest young man who was serious about finding the path that led to eternal life. His question is a serious question, ‘What good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ In his reply Jesus named a number of commandments, all of which have to do with how we are to relate to other people. Jesus indicates that the way to life for ourselves entails relating in a life-giving way to others. This young man was not satisfied with Jesus’ answer because he felt he was already doing what Jesus was asking for, and, yet, he knew there was more he could be doing. When Jesus revealed what this ‘more’ would involve for this particular young man, it again had to do with his relationship to others, in particular the poor, the needy; Jesus called on him to sell what he had and give the money to the poor. This was a step too far for him. Jesus did not make this particular demand of everybody he encountered. Yet, for all of us, the path to life, the path of life, will always be the path of love, of loving relationships with others. By his teaching, by his life and his death, Jesus shows us what relating in a loving way to others looks like.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iii) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe young man who approaches Jesus in the gospel reading this morning is a very religious man. He had kept all the commandments of the Jewish Law since his youth. Yet, his spiritual yearning was not satisfied. He almost put it up to Jesus to give him a bigger challenge. However, when Jesus did make a call on him, the young man couldn’t respond to it. In one of the most poignant verses of the gospel we are told, ‘he went away sad, for he was a man of great wealth’. There was something he needed to let go of to take the path that would have brought him true joy, but because he couldn’t let go, he experienced sadness. Sometimes there can be a relationship between the sadness we might feel and our inability to let go of whatever it is we are tenaciously holding on to. The young man held on to his possessions because, at some level, he must have felt they would bring him happiness and life. We can hold on to people, to circumstances, to whatever, in the conviction that therein lies our happiness, our security. In reality, our true happiness and peace lies in letting go of whatever it is that is holding us back from responding to the call that the Lord is making on us in the here and now.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iv) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe young man in this morning’s gospel reading is clearly a very well intentioned person and also a very good living person. He has been faithful to the commandments that Jesus cites. Yet, he senses that is being called to something more, and, so he probes Jesus with his question, ‘What more do I need to do?’ For all that, when it comes to the personal call that Jesus addressed to him, he could not answer it. For this particular young man, the call to follow Jesus required him to let go of his great wealth. Jesus was asking him to put his trust in God rather than in his great wealth. He could not bring himself to do this, and, so, he went away sad. He could not live with the answer to his own question and, as a result, he remained deeply dissatisfied. Jesus addresses a personal call to each one of us; it will take a different form for each of us and will have different implications for each of us. However, whatever form Jesus’ call takes for us, it will always involve the call to find our security in God as Jesus reveals him to us, rather than in anything we possess or achieve. Our ultimate treasure is to be found in heaven, not on earth. As Jesus says elsewhere, it is God we are to love with all our heart, mind, soul and strength. Only then will we have the freedom to hold everything else lightly.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(v) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn the gospel reading this morning we have the story of a good man who wanted to be better. He had kept all the commandments of the Jewish Law faithfully, but he had a sense that this was not enough. He felt called to something more, and, so, he said to Jesus, ‘What more do I need to do?’ We might find ourselves being able to identify with this man. There are times in our lives when we too might experience in ourselves a strong desire to go beyond where we are, to grow in our relationship with the Lord, to be more generous in the doing of his work. In one shape or form we find ourselves asking ourselves this man’s question, ‘What more do I need to do?’ In the gospel reading, this man could not live with the answer that Jesus gave to his question. Jesus asked this particular man to do something he didn’t ask everybody to do. He was to sell his possession, give his money to the poor and then to set out along the road after Jesus, as Peter, Andrew, James, John and others had done. One of the saddest verses in the gospels comes at the end of our reading, ‘when the young man heard these words he went away sad’. If we ask the Lord the young man’s question we cannot anticipate how the Lord will answer us. Yet, the Lord has some purpose for our lives which will always take us beyond where we are in some sense. We find our happiness in yielding to the Lord’s purpose for our lives. If we do so, we can be assured that he will give us all the grace and strength we need for the journey.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vi) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nMany young people are receiving their exam results at this time. They are thinking about the options that are open to them on the basis of those results. ‘What college should I go to?’ ‘What course should I do?’ It is a time of searching and seeking for them. No doubt many of them will look for guidance and advice so as to make the best decision possible. Today’s gospel reading puts before us a young man who is clearly a seeker and a searcher. Indeed, he is struggling with one of the bigger questions of life, ‘What good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ Questions don’t come much bigger than that. He is asking ‘What does it mean to live a good life?’ ‘What is the path to true and lasting happiness?’ Human beings have always asked this fundamental question. We have probably all asked it of ourselves at some time in our lives. In response to his question, Jesus directs him to his own Jewish tradition, the commandments of the Jewish Law. It is always worth exploring our own religious tradition; there can be a great deal more there than we realize. Yet, this young man knows his religious tradition well, and he is still searching. ‘What more do I need to do?’ Finally, Jesus points to himself as the goal of the young man’s search, ‘Come, follow me’. This was a bridge too far for the young man; it would have involved letting go of his many possessions, which he couldn’t do. His journey to Jesus ends in sadness; the happiness, the life, he searched for eluded him. Jesus offers himself to all of us as the goal of all our searching, as the answer to our deepest questions. He assures us that in following him, in walking in his way, we will find genuine life, true happiness.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vii) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe gospel reading today presents us with an idealistic young man. He wants to be sure of possessing eternal life, and he asks Jesus what is the one good deed he must do to ensure his entering into eternal life. He is clearly a young man who took his religion seriously. He tells Jesus that he has kept the commandments that Jesus quotes to him. Jesus declares that this is sufficient to enter into life. The conversation could have ended there. Yet, this young man ensures that the conversation does not end here by pressing Jesus further, ‘What more do I need to do?’ He senses in himself that he is capable of even more than what he is already doing. Jesus respects his desire for ‘more’ and there and then calls on him to sell what he owned, give it to the poor and become one of that group who follow Jesus in a very close and personal way. If he wanted ‘more’, Jesus would give it to him. However, the young man couldn’t live with Jesus’ answer to his second question. He was too attached to his possessions to be free to do what Jesus invited him to do, and a great sadness came over him. We can probably all find within ourselves the same longing to be better, to do more, that was so evident in the life of this young man. After all, our hearts are restless until they rest in God. Yet, like this young man, we too often find that within ourselves obstacles to the Lord’s call to grow towards that more we so desire. We discover that we are not as free as we need to be. Attachments of various kinds hold us back. We don’t yet have the glorious freedom of the children of God, in the words of Saint Paul. We need to keep praying to grow in the freedom to fully become the person the Lord is calling us to be.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(viii) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nMany of the questions that are put to Jesus in the gospels are with a view to testing him. However, the question which a young man puts to Jesus in today’s gospel reading is very sincere, ‘Master what good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ It is the question of someone who wants to do what is good, the right thing, and, thereby, secure his ultimate salvation. The question, ‘What is the path to life?’ is an important question for all of us. Jesus answers this man’s serious question from within the Jewish tradition that they share; he quotes the second half of the ten commandments which deal with how we relate to others, and he then adds to them the second of the two great commandments, ‘you must love your neighbour as yourself’. Jesus is saying to this man that the way to life is the way of love. For us as Christians, it is Jesus who shows us what the way of love looks life by his teaching and his life. When we ask a serious question of someone, the answer will not always satisfy us. Clearly, this young man was not satisfied by Jesus’ answer. ‘What more do I need to do?’, he asked. In response to this second question, Jesus calls this young man to follow him on his journey, just as Peter, James, John, Matthew and others have done. This would have involved for this young man leaving his many possessions so as to follow physically in the footsteps of someone who had nowhere to lay his head. He couldn’t bring himself to do that; he was too attached to his possession. His possessions possessed him. The realization that he wasn’t free to answer the call of Jesus left him sad. He was a good man, but he discovered he wasn’t free to do what the Lord wanted of him. Many of us may find ourselves in that same place. We are fundamentally good people, but some excessive attachment in our lives holds us back from answering the Lord’s call as generously as we might. Before that realization, we need to keep praying for a greater share in the freedom of the Holy Spirit, the freedom that Jesus displayed to the full, the freedom to go where the Lord is calling us to go.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ix) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Year\n\nThe young man in today’s gospel reading clearly has a very good heart. There is something very appealing about him. He had very good values and had a clear goal in life. He wanted to live in such a way that he would inherit eternal life, life in God’s presence. He kept the commandments God gave to Moses, including the great commandment to love one’s neighbour as oneself. Yet, he wasn’t satisfied. ‘What more do I need to do?’, he asked Jesus. There is such a thing as a holy restlessness. We are conscious of a ‘more’ we haven’t yet attained. We sense the Lord calling us beyond where we are, even though where we are is good. We can point to good things we are doing and, yet, there are moments when we wonder if we are answering the Lord’s call as fully as we might. A questioning restlessness creeps into our overall feeling of satisfaction with ourselves, with our relationship with God and others. Like the young man, we are drawn by a sense that there is ‘more’. Jesus took the man’s searching question seriously and called him to a follow him in a very radical way, which entailed giving away all his great wealth. He was too attached to his great wealth; he couldn’t respond to Jesus’ call and a sadness came over him when he realized he couldn’t reach towards the ‘more’ that he so desired. We are all held back in different ways from responding to the Lord’s call to follow him more fully, to become an even more authentic disciple than we are. The young man’s struggle is the struggle of us all. At the very least, we need to remain alert to that deep desire within us for the ‘more’, even though we struggle to follow through on it.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(x) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe question the young man asked Jesus in today’s gospel reading, ‘What good deed must I do to possess eternal life?’ was a question of great importance to him. Here was a serious young man who wanted to live as well as he could, in a way that was in accordance with God’s will. It is clear from his conversation with Jesus that he was already living a very good life. Jesus put before him the commandments that have to do with how we relate to others, and he could confidently say that he had kept all these commandments. Yet, he felt there was something more he could be doing, ‘What more do I need to do?’ It is admirable when people who are living good lives want to live even better lives. We sense that desire within ourselves. We may be living well, in ways that are in keeping with God’s desire for our lives, but we sense there is another step we could take. We could launch further out into the deep. We could be more generous in response to the Lord’s call. That realization can leave us a little unsettled, just as the young man was unsettled, in spite of all his good qualities. This form of feeling unsettled is ultimately something good. It brings home to us that the Lord is always calling us beyond where we are in some way. In the gospel reading, the young man couldn’t respond to the Lord’s call to him to go beyond where he was. In his case, it would have involved letting o of his great wealth, giving it to the poor and following Jesus in a very radical way. As a result, he went away sad. The Lord’s call to us to go beyond where we are, to grow in our relationship with him, will take a different form for each one of us. The ‘more’ the Lord is calling us into will always take account of our own unique circumstances and situation in life. If we can discern what that call of the Lord means for me personally and respond to it, then we will find life, both in the here and now and in eternity.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(xi) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nSometimes, when people ask Jesus a question in the gospels it is with a hostile intent. They are trying to trap him or trip him up. However, the question of the young man in today’s gospel reading comes from a good place within him. He wants to know what path he must take to be assured of eternal life. When Jesus directs him towards the second half of the Ten Commandments that have to do with how we relate to others, the young man asks, ‘I have kept all these. What more do I need to do?’ He is clearly a very idealistic young man. He is already living a good and loving life, but he senses that there is more he could do. He feels a call to go beyond where he is. We can all experience that same call from time to time. We sense that we are living a reasonably good life and, yet, we also sense that we could live a better life, a more generous and loving life. There is a sense in which the Lord is always calling us beyond where we are. If we are spiritually alive and aware at all, we will experience a certain restlessness. We subsequently discover that this young man had great wealth. In the time and place of Jesus a relatively small proportion of the population had great wealth. When Jesus responded to the young man’s question, ‘What more do I need to do?’ with the invitation to sell his many possessions, give the money to the poor and follow him as he goes from place to place, the young man lacked the freedom to respond. In a sense, his possessions possessed him and he went away sad. We can all lack the freedom to respond to the Lord’s call to take the next step in our relationship with him. We can be held back in all kinds of ways, by all sorts of excessive attachments. Yet, the Lord keeps calling and we need to keep praying for the freedom of the Spirit, the freedom to respond to the Lord’s continuing call to us.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(xii) Monday, Twentieth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nYoung people are often searching for the right path to take in life. They want what is best for themselves, for others, for the world. The young man in today’s gospel reading displays something of that spirit. He was searching for the path of life. He asked Jesus what good deed he had to do to possess eternal life. He was clearly a man of faith who believed that God was setting before us a path that would lead to the fullness of life beyond this earthly life. We don’t have to be young to have that searching spirit. We retain something of it throughout our lives. If we are true to what is deepest in us, we will want to take a path that is life-giving for ourselves and for others in this life and that will bring us to eternal life. The young man’s question was a serious one and Jesus treated it seriously. The answer Jesus gave him was initially from his own Jewish tradition. Jesus told the young man to keep the commandments, especially those that concern how we relate to others, which can be summed up in the single commandment, ‘love your neighbour as yourself’. Jesus was saying that love is the path to life. Jesus would say the same to us today. It is in loving one another as the Lord has loved us that we will find life. Yet, this young man felt that he had kept this commandment of love and he pushed Jesus to challenge him a little more. However, when Jesus did so, calling on him to renounce his great wealth, give it to the poor and then join Jesus’ small band of close followers, he baulked. It was a step too far for him, and he went away sad. As well as the general calling to love others with the Lord’s love, given to us all, the Lord has a calling that is personal to each one of us. It will be different for each of us, reflecting our personal circumstances and capacities. Every day we try to listen carefully to that very personal call of the Lord, so that we can answer it with the Lord’s help, with the strength that he alone can give us. This will be our own personal path to that fullness of life which the Lord desires for us all.\n\nFr. Martin Hogan.\n\n18th August >> Fr. Martin's Homilies/Reflections on Today's Mass Readings for the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time (B) (Inc. John 6:51-58): ‘Whoever eats me will draw life from me’.\n\nTwentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time (B)\n\nGospel (Except USA) John 6:51-58 My flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.\n\nJesus said to the crowd:\n\n‘I am the living bread which has come down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world.’\n\nThen the Jews started arguing with one another: ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ they said. Jesus replied:\n\n‘I tell you most solemnly, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I shall raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him. As I, who am sent by the living Father, myself draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me. This is the bread come down from heaven; not like the bread our ancestors ate: they are dead, but anyone who eats this bread will live for ever.’\n\nGospel (USA) John 6:51–58 My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.\n\nJesus said to the crowds: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.” The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever.”\n\nHomilies (7)\n\n(i) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nOne of the verses in Patrick Kavanagh’s well-known poem, ‘A Christmas Childhood’, goes as follows, ‘A water-hen screeched in the bog, Mass-going feet Crunched the wafer-ice on the pot-holes, Somebody wistfully twisted the bellows wheel’. He is nostalgically looking back at the Christmases of his childhood in his native Monaghan. I have always been struck by the line in that verse, ‘Mass-going feet crunched the wafer-thin ice on the pot-holes’. There may be less ‘Mass-going feet’ these days that there were when Patrick Kavanagh wrote his poem. Yet, many of us still feel drawn to gather to celebrate Sunday Mass, as we are doing here this Sunday.\n\nWhy do we come to Mass on a Sunday when there are many other things we could be doing? Perhaps in the past, people went to Mass because it was something everybody did. There was an element of cultural and family pressure. That is certainly not the case today. You have come to Mass this Sunday because you have chosen to do so. In many ways it is a counter cultural choice. It is going against the general trend. People may ask you, ‘Why are you still going to Mass on a Sunday?’ It is a question that is worth asking and pondering over. Perhaps today’s gospel reading points us in the direction of an answer. There Jesus calls on us to eat his flesh and drink his blood and promises us that if we do so we will draw life from him. His language of eating his flesh and drinking his blood is quite startling and provocative. The question people asked in the gospel reading is an understandable one, ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ Jesus is clearly referring to what we have come to call the Eucharist. His words point ahead to the last supper, when he took bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to his disciples saying, ‘This is my body’, and when he took a cup of wine, blessed it and gave it to his disciples saying, ‘This is my blood of the covenant’. In speaking of his flesh and blood, his body and blood, he was referring to his whole self, who he was and what he stood for. He gave his whole self to us out of love for us on the cross. At the last supper he gave his whole self to his disciples under the form of bread and wine, in anticipation of the gift of himself he would make the following day on the cross. At every Mass, the risen Lord continues to give us the gift of his whole self. There is no greater gift he could give us. He gives us this gift of himself to nourish us spiritually, just as a baby is physically nourished their mother in the mother’s womb. As the unborn child draws life from the mother, so, in the words of Jesus in the gospel reading, when we receive him in the Eucharist we draw life from him, just as he draws life from God his Father. The life that we draw from him is not just physical life but the life of God, a life that endures beyond this earthly life.\n\nWhy do we go to Mass, especially on a Sunday? We go because the Lord has left us this wonderful gift through which he continues to give himself to us in love so that we may have life and have it to the full. We go because we recognize that we need this gift to sustain us on our journey of faith, just as the unborn child needs the mother’s flesh and blood for physical sustenance. The Lord gives himself to us in the Eucharist to nourish our relationship with him, to sustain that relationship in a world where that relationship is so often put to the test. He renews the gift of his whole self to us at every Eucharist so that we can renew the gift of our whole selves to him. In the words of the gospel reading, through the Eucharist he comes to live in us, so that we can continue to live in him. The only reason we come to the Eucharist is because we have personally chosen to be in relationship with Jesus and we want that relationship to be sustained and nourished. We gather at the Eucharist as a community of disciples, all of us at different stages of our faith journey. Our relationship with the Lord is personal and unique to each of us. Yet, wherever we are on that journey, we all have a place here. We are all welcome here. The Lord wants to give the gift of his whole self to all of us because we all need the spiritual sustenance that only he can give. Like the Woman Wisdom’s feast in the first reading, the invitation is extended to all from the city’s heights.\n\nThe Lord gives his whole self to us in the Eucharist to empower us to bring his whole self to others. We receive the Lord’s body in the Eucharist so that we may be his living body for others. We are sent forth from the Eucharist to live lives that redeem the present age, in the words of the second reading, lives that allow the Lord to be present to all whom we meet.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ii) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nIt can be tempting to give out about the age in which we live. We can be very aware of the shortcomings of our time and culture. We often complain of falling standards in all walks of life. We are conscious of a breakdown in community, a decline in moral values, a fracturing of family life. The increase in the suicide rate, especially among young men, is disturbing evidence that many people experience our times as devoid of meaning. We could easily get discouraged about our contemporary society.\n\nI was struck by the statement of Paul at the beginning of the second reading, ‘This may be a wicked age, but your lives should redeem it’. In his letter to the Romans he says something similar: ‘Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good’. Paul was well aware of the dark side of his own culture. Yet, that reality did not discourage him. He was convinced that the lives of believers could redeem the age in which they lived. We don’t often think of ourselves as redeemers. We tend to reserve the term ‘redeemer’ for Christ. Yet, Paul is prepared to extend that term to all those who have been baptized into Christ. He recognizes that the Lord working through us can redeem the time, the age, in which we live. In so far as we are in relationship with the Lord, our lives can make a difference for the better. We can never underestimate the extent to which the Lord can make us a force for good, a source of life and light, in our world. Jesus addresses his disciples in the gospels as the light of the world and the salt of the earth.\n\nAs Christians we recognize that if the Lord is to work in a redeeming and life-giving way through us, we need to keep our relationship with him alive. That call to a close relationship with the Lord is strongly present in the readings this morning. In the first reading, the Wisdom of God calls on people to come to her so as to eat the bread and drink the wine of her teaching. In the gospel reading, Jesus, the true wisdom of God, goes further and calls on his disciples, not only to come to him, but to eat his flesh and drink his blood. This kind of language must have seemed a bit shocking at the time. We can sympathize with the Jews who asked, ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ Indeed in the verse immediately following where our reading ends, some of Jesus’ own disciples say, ‘This is intolerable language. How could anyone accept it?’ Yet, in spite of the hostile reaction to his words from the Jews, and even from some of his disciples, Jesus did not try to speak in a way that was more acceptable to his hearers. The language of eating his flesh and drinking his blood was not up for negotiation.\n\nThe call of Jesus to come to him raises no hackles, but his call, ‘Eat me’, still has the power to make us sit up a bit. In calling on us to eat his flesh and drink his blood, Jesus shows us just how deeply he wants to be in communion with us. It is the Eucharist that makes possible that depth of communion between us and the Lord that he desires. The Lord wants us not merely to come to him, but to consume him. He wants us to take him into ourselves, to really digest him, in the sense of making our own his outlook on life, his values, his attitudes, his way of relating. In absorbing him in this way he promises that we will come to share in his very life. As Jesus says in the gospel reading, ‘Whoever eats me will draw life from me’. Jesus gives himself to us as food and drink so that we may live with his life. Whenever we eat food, the food becomes part of us; it lives in us, but when we receive the Lord in the Eucharist, he does not become part of us in that sense. Rather we become part of him; we live with his own life. This is a life that never ends. ‘Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life’.\n\nThe Lord offers us this level of communion with himself so that our own lives may redeem the times in which we live. The life that we receive from the Lord in the Eucharist is to flow through us and enhance and ennoble the world of which we are a part. When we say ‘Amen’ before receiving communion, we are not only saying ‘I believe this is the body of Christ’, but we are also saying ‘Amen’ to the Lord dwelling in our lives so that he may carry out his life-giving mission in the world through us.\n\nThe Eucharist is at the heart of the Church’s life. Pope John Paul II in his Encyclical Letter on the Eucharist puts it this way, ‘The Church has received the Eucharist from Christ her Lord not as one gift – however precious – among so many others, but as the gift par excellence, for it is the gift of himself in his sacred humanity, as well as the gift of his saving work’. We receive the Lord’s gift of himself in this Eucharist so that his saving work can continue in our world through our lives. He comes to us as food and drink in the Eucharist so that the age in which we live might be redeemed by our presence and our lives.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iii) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nYou may remember that we had a sister from the Medical Missionaries of Mary speak at all the Masses a few Sundays ago. I was struck by her comments about the good work that various church agencies were doing throughout the world. I was reminded of what she said by a verse in this morning’s second reading where Paul says, ‘This may be a wicked age, but your lives should redeem it’. Paul was clearly of the view that the lives of those who have been baptized into Christ are capable of making a difference for the better to the world in which we live. He is reminding us that as members of Christ’s body, we can all bring something of Christ’s life-giving love to others. We may be inclined to think, ‘What difference could I make?’ We may feel that we are not good enough to make a real difference for the good in our world. Yet, even if we can be slow at times to take ourselves seriously as people who can redeem the age, the Lord does take us seriously. He has great work to do in and through us, if only we make ourselves available to him, and if only we trust that, in spite of our many weaknesses and failings, he can and will work powerfully through us.\n\nThe Lord wants to work through us, but before he works through us, he gives himself to us. The Lord equips us to share in his redeeming and life-giving work. He gives himself to us so that we can then give him to others. That is the message of this morning’s gospel reading. Jesus speaks there of giving us his flesh to eat and his blood to drink. It is hard to conceive of a more striking way for Jesus to speak about giving himself to us. In fact, Jesus’ way of speaking was so shocking that many of those who were listening to him could not take what he said seriously. According to our gospel reading, some asked, ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ Even some of Jesus’ own disciples, according to the evangelist, found this language of Jesus intolerable. Immediately after where our gospel reading ends, we are informed that some of Jesus’ disciples said, ‘This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?’\n\nThe teaching of Jesus in this morning’s gospel reading is challenging. It can be as difficult for us today, two thousand years later, as it was for some of Jesus’ contemporaries to take fully on board his insistence that we eat his flesh and drink his blood. Jesus gave his flesh and blood for the life of the world on the cross. He gave everything he had for the life of the world - such was his love for the world, his love for all of us. Jesus not only gave his flesh and blood on the cross for the life of the world, but according to our gospel reading he wants us to eat his flesh and drink his blood. This is clearly a reference to the Eucharist. The flesh and blood that Jesus gave for us on the cross he gives to us at every Eucharist, under the form of bread and wine. At the last supper, on the evening before he died, Jesus took bread and said to his disciples, ‘take and eat. This bread is my body, my flesh’. He then took a cup of wine and said, ‘take and drink. This wine is my blood of the covenant’. At the last supper, Jesus gave his disciples his flesh to eat and his blood to drink, under the form of bread and wine. The Lord who gave himself totally for us on Good Friday, gives himself totally to us at every Eucharist. That has been the faith of the church since that first Holy Thursday and Good Friday. According to this morning’s gospel reading, he gives himself to us in the Eucharist so that we can draw life from him. ‘As I draw life from the Father’, he says, ‘so whoever eats me will draw life from me’. In the Eucharist we draw from the Lord’s risen life, and that is why he can say, ‘anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life’. We generally think of eternal life as life after death, buy according to today’s gospel reading, eternal life can also be ours before death. We begin to share in the Lord’s own life here and now when in faith we receive the Lord in the Eucharist.\n\nIn receiving the Lord in the Eucharist, we are at the same time receiving all that he stands for; the values by which he lives; we are receiving his teaching or, in the language of the first reading, his wisdom. Just as in the first reading, the Wisdom of God says ‘Come and eat my bread’, in the Eucharist, Jesus, the Wisdom of God, says, ‘Come and eat my flesh and drink my blood’. The Eucharist calls on us to imbibe the Lord fully, to take into ourselves all that he is, all that he lived and died for - his values, his attitudes, his mind and heart. If we do that, then our lives will redeem the age in which we live. The Lord will continue his redeeming and life-giving work through us.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iv) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nAfter people have moved into a new house or do some refurbishment on their home, they often have a little celebration in the house to which they invite people. Once the house is ready to their satisfaction they open it up to others and provide some refreshments. We often call it a house warmer. It is as if the house needs a good presence of other people to be properly launched. When you look at today’s first reading you find something similar happening. We have this woman by the name of Wisdom. She builds herself a house, clearly a very elegant house; it has no less than seven pillars. She then throws a feast of fine wine and good meat and sends out her maid servants into the streets to gather people to her table. In that reading the building of a house, the making of a feast, the invitation to come and eat and drink, is an imaginative way of speaking about God as the wise host who invites all of humanity to learn from his wisdom. It is interesting that God is portrayed as a woman in this reading, Woman Wisdom.\n\nThat image of Woman Wisdom who says, ‘Come and eat of my bread, drink the wine I have prepared’ finds an echo in the figure of Jesus in the gospel reading who declares, ‘I am the living bread which has come down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever’. Like Woman Wisdom Jesus invites us to come and eat of his bread, but unlike Woman Wisdom he declares himself to be that bread. We are to eat of him, to drink of him. More specifically he calls on us to eat his flesh and to drink his blood. This goes far beyond anything Woman Wisdom calls for in that first reading. Jesus’ language of eating his flesh and drinking his blood is shocking in many respects. We can sympathize with those who object, ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’ We cannot hear this language without thinking of the words of Jesus to his disciples at the last supper when, taking bread, blessing it and breaking it, he gave it to them saying, ‘Take, eat, this is my body’, and taking and blessing a cup of wine he gave it to them, saying, ‘Take, drink, this is the new covenant in my blood’. He gave himself to his disciples, his body and blood, under the form of bread and wine. The last supper became the first Eucharist. We cannot but hear the language of the Eucharist in this morning’s gospel reading, the Eucharist which we are now celebrating together.\n\nWe invite people to our home and we place food and drink before them and we invite them to eat and drink. Jesus invites us to his table and he puts himself before us as food and drink and invites us to eat and drink. In language that is very daring Jesus declares himself to be our food and drink, the one who can satisfy our deepest hungers and thirsts, our hunger and thirst for life. Jesus declares in that gospel reading, ‘anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life’. We tend to think of ‘eternal life’ as a life that only begins after death. Yet, it is clear from the gospel reading that by ‘eternal life’ Jesus does not just mean a life that begins after this earthly life ends. He understands eternal life as a life that we can begin to experience in the midst of this earthly life. That is why he says in that gospel reading, ‘as I, who am sent by the living Father, myself draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me’. Just as in the course of his earthly life, Jesus drew life from God, so in the course of our earthly lives we can draw life from Jesus through our communion with him in the Eucharist. The life Jesus drew from God and we draw from Jesus is eternal life; it is the life of God. Here and now through our communion with Jesus in the Eucharist we can enjoy a first taste of eternal life. What is eternal life only the life of God, the life of Love, of a love that is unconditional and eternal? It is that life which we begin to taste in the Eucharist, because the Eucharist is the celebration of God’s love for us in Christ. In the Eucharist God’s loving gift of his Son is made present over and over again. God so loved the world that he gave his only Son.\n\nWe come to the Eucharist to draw life from the risen Lord to draw God’s life from him, God’s love. We are then sent from the Eucharist to be channels of that life, of that love, for each other. We come to the Eucharist hungering and thirsting for life, for authentic life, the life of God, the love of God, and we are sent out from the Eucharist as life givers, as agents of God’s life and love within our homes, our society, our world.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(v) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nLast Sunday I spoke about Francis Xavier Van Thuan who was archbishop of what is now Ho Chi Min City. For thirteen years he was imprisoned in North Vietnam, spending nine of years those in solitary confinement. On one occasion, a copy of the New Testament was smuggled into the prison for the Catholic prisoners. To ensure that they could all share God’s word, the prisoners ripped the New Testament into little sheets which were then distributed among the prisoners. Each prisoner memorized by heart the sheet that he or she received. Every sunset, the prisoners took it in turn to recite aloud the part that they had memorized. Archbishop Van Thuan recalled after his release from prison how moving it was to hear the Word of God recited with such strength of faith in the silence and the darkness. He said that no one could doubt at that moment the presence of God in his Word. I was reminded of that story again by a verse in today’s second reading from Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, ‘This may be a wicked age but your lives should redeem it’.\n\nPaul was aware that the values of his surrounding culture were in many ways hostile to those of the gospel. He knew how easy it was for members of the church to be influenced by those values. Yet, he also knew that they could witness to the values of the gospel in that culture by how they lived. In doing so, as Paul puts it, they could redeem the age in which they lived. It might seem strange to think of ourselves as redeemers. We acknowledge Jesus as the redeemer. ‘To redeem’ is ‘to set free’, to deliver from all forms of enslavement. We look to Jesus as the one who delivers us from all that works against what Paul calls the glorious freedom of the children of God. Yet, Paul was very aware that Jesus wanted to continue his redeeming, liberating, work in and through his followers, the church. The church is the Lord’s body, where the Lord’s redeeming work is to find expression in every age. In his letter to the church in Rome, Paul says, ‘do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good’. We are to be faithful to the gospel even in environments where it is being rejected so that the Lord’s work of redeeming the age can continue through us.\n\nThose prisoners in Ho Chi Min city were victims of a culture that denied religious freedom. Yet, they found their own way of standing up against it. When an unexpected opportunity came their way to feed their faith, in the form of the smuggled New Testament, they seized this opportunity with courage and imagination. They devised a way to ensure that everyone could feed on the God’s Word, the Bread of life. They knew that here was bread that could nourish their spirits, and satisfy their deepest hungers and bring freedom even in their imprisonment. When Jesus says in today’s gospel reading, ‘I am the living bread which has come down from heaven’, he is saying that he alone can satisfy the deepest hungers of the human heart, the hunger for a love that is unconditional and all forgiving, for authentic freedom. One of the ways he comes to us today as Bread of Life is through his Word. The church speaks of the lectern from which the word of God is proclaimed as the table of the Word. In feeding ourselves on the Bread of the Lord’s Word, we create an opening for the Lord to continue his redeeming work in us and through us, his work of overcoming evil with good.\n\nThe prisoners’ action of tearing up the New Testament into sheets and passing around the sheets so as to ensure that every prisoner could have a personal encounter with the Lord’s word reminds me of what happens at Mass with regard to the consecrated bread. It is broken into small pieces so that all can share in it. The prisoners broke the bread of the word because they had no access to the bread of the Eucharist. We are fortunate to have access to both. The prisoners entered into communion with the Lord and with each other in and through their breaking of the bread of the Lord’s word and their sharing it. This is something we can all do whenever we gather to share and hear the Lord’s word. Unlike the prisoners, we can also enter into communion with the Lord and with each other in and through our breaking of the Eucharistic bread and our sharing in it. In today’s gospel reading, Jesus offers us his flesh to eat and his blood to drink. This is an even deeper form of communion with the Lord and with each other than is possible through the sharing of the bread of the word. Jesus comes to us in the Eucharist to nourish our faith, hope and love. He gives us himself, under the form of bread and wine, so that we can more truly be his body in the world. He draws us into this very intimate form of communion with himself and with each other so that our lives are empowered to redeem the age in which we live.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vi) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nFrancis Xavier Van Thuan was archbishop of Saigon, now Ho Chi Min City.

We are to be faithful to the gospel even in environments where it is being rejected so that the Lord’s work of redeeming the age can continue through us.\n\nArchbishop Van Thuan and the other prisoners were victims of a culture that denied religious freedom. Yet, they found their own way of standing up against it, of redeeming the atheistic culture around them. When an unexpected opportunity came their way to feed their faith, in the form of the smuggled New Testament, they seized it with courage and imagination. They devised a way to ensure that everyone could feed on the God’s Word. They knew that here was bread that could nourish their spirits, satisfy their deepest hungers and bring freedom even in their imprisonment.

The prisoners’ action of tearing up the New Testament into sheets and passing them around so to ensure that every prisoner could have a personal encounter with the Lord’s word reminds me of what happens at Mass with regard to the consecrated bread. It is given out in small pieces so that all can share in it. The prisoners broke the bread of the word because they had no access to the bread of the Eucharist. We are fortunate to have access to both. The prisoners entered into communion with the Lord and with each other by breaking the bread of the Lord’s word and sharing it.

Unlike the prisoners, we can also enter into communion with the Lord and with each other in and through our breaking of the Eucharistic bread and our sharing in it. In today’s gospel reading, Jesus offers us his flesh to eat and his blood to drink. This is an even deeper form of communion with the Lord and with each other than is possible through the sharing of the bread of the word. Jesus comes to us in the Eucharist to nourish our faith, hope and love. In the words of the first reading, Jesus says to us, ‘Come and eat my bread, drink the wine I have prepared!’ He gives us himself, under the form of bread and wine, so that we can more truly be his body in the world. He draws us into communion with himself and each other to empower us for our task to redeem the age in which we live.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(vii) Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nRecent statistics show that the percentage of Catholics in Ireland who go to Sunday Mass is in decline. The same pattern is to be found in many other countries of Western Europe. There are probably many complex reasons for this, such as, secularism, disillusionment and anger with the church, loss of faith, poor quality celebration of liturgy. When going to Sunday Mass is no longer the norm, even among baptized Catholics, it invites the question, ‘Why do the rest of us go to Mass on Sunday?’ ‘Why do I go to Mass on Sunday?’ Today’s gospel reading gives us an approach to answering that question.\n\nWhen Jesus speaks in the gospel reading about eating his flesh and drinking his blood, the reference is clearly to what came to be called the Eucharist. At the last supper, Jesus identified his body or his flesh with the bread that he took, broke, blessed and gave to his disciples. He identified his blood with the wine that he took, blessed and gave to his disciples. He was giving his body and blood, his flesh and blood, his entire self to his disciples, under the form of bread and wine. He called on his disciples to ‘do this in memory of me’, to keep doing what Jesus had done at the last supper, his words and actions, so that he could continue to give himself fully and completely to all future disciples under the form of bread and wine. That is why Saint Paul, writing about twenty five years after the death and resurrection of Jesus, could say, ‘the cup of blessing that we bless is it not a communion in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a communion in the body of Christ?’ Paul is clearly referring to the Eucharist as it was being celebrated and understood within a few decades of Jesus’ life. In taking the bread that has been blessed and broken and the wine that has been blessed we are entering into communion with the body and blood of Jesus, we are uniting ourselves with the risen Lord.\n\nJesus says something very similar to Paul in the gospel reading. He declares that those who eat his flesh and drink his blood in the Eucharist live in him and he lives in them. Through the Eucharist there is a deep communion between ourselves and the Lord, a mutual indwelling. Jesus goes on to say that because of our deep communion with the Lord through the Eucharist, we can draw life from him. ‘Whoever eats me will draw life from me’. That is one of the reasons we go to Mass, to draw life from the risen Lord, a life that impacts on us here and now, and also endures into eternity. Jesus is talking about the life of the Spirit, the life of God, a life that enhances our human living and endures into eternity. It is because Jesus comes to us in the Eucharist to give us life, in this sense, that he speaks of himself in the gospel as ‘the living bread which has come down from heaven’ or, more simply, the ‘Bread of life’. We probably don’t appreciate the importance of bread in the time and place of Jesus. Today, as we wander around a supermarket, we can buy any kind of food we fancy, provided we can afford to do so. I can choose a menu every day from a vast array of options. In this world of full consumer choice, it is difficult to grasp the full significance of Jesus describing himself as the Bread of Life. In the biblical world, including the world of Jesus, the key to life was ready access to grain which can be turned into bread. Grain meant bread and bread meant life; its absence meant famine and death. Everyone understood and felt their dependence on bread. When Jesus declares himself to be the bread of life, he is presenting himself as the heavenly equivalent of bread. To survive in this life, people needed access to God. Jesus was saying that to survive in the presence of God, to survive spiritually, we need to rely on him.\n\nIt is clear from the gospel reading that many of Jesus’ listeners did not recognize their reliance on him for spiritual survival, did not accept his claim to be the Bread of Life. ‘How can this man give us his flesh to eat?’, they asked. We come to Mass because we recognize Jesus as our Bread of Life. At some deep level, we know that we need to be in communion with him if we are to be spiritually alive, and, therefore, fully alive as a human being. We recognize our dependence on Jesus for true life, for what he calls elsewhere, life to the full. We come to Mass not because of custom or culture or, much less, coercion, but because we want to respond to Jesus’ wonderful invitation to come to him and eat of his flesh and drink of his blood so that we may draw life from him, the same life that he draws from the Father. That is the statement we are making every time to go to Mass, whether the Mass is a small gathering of people in a room or the huge gathering that will take place in the Phoenix Park next Sunday. We are then sent out from Mass to bring something of the Lord’s life we have received to those we meet. We are sent to become bread broken for others by reaching out to others in love.\n\nFr. Martin Hogan.\n\n16th August >> Fr. Martin's Reflections/Homilies on Today's Mass Readings for Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time (Inc. Matthew 19:3-12): ‘They are no longer two but one body’.\n\nFriday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nGospel (Except USA) Matthew 19:3-12 Husband and wife are no longer two, but one body.\n\nSome Pharisees approached Jesus, and to test him they said, ‘Is it against the Law for a man to divorce his wife on any pretext whatever?’ He answered, ‘Have you not read that the creator from the beginning made them male and female and that he said: This is why a man must leave father and mother, and cling to his wife, and the two become one body? They are no longer two, therefore, but one body. So then, what God has united, man must not divide.’ They said to him, ‘Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal should be given in cases of divorce?’ ‘It was because you were so unteachable’ he said ‘that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not like this from the beginning. Now I say this to you: the man who divorces his wife – I am not speaking of fornication – and marries another, is guilty of adultery.’ The disciples said to him, ‘If that is how things are between husband and wife, it is not advisable to marry.’ But he replied, ‘It is not everyone who can accept what I have said, but only those to whom it is granted. There are eunuchs born that way from their mother’s womb, there are eunuchs made so by men and there are eunuchs who have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.’\n\nGospel Matthew 19:3-12 Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.\n\nSome Pharisees approached Jesus, and tested him, saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?” He said in reply, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, man must not separate.” They said to him, “Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss her?” He said to them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.” His disciples said to him, “If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” He answered, “Not all can accept this word, but only those to whom that is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.”\n\nReflections (10)\n\n(i) Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn today’s gospel reading, Jesus turns to the opening chapters of the first book of the Bible, the Book of Genesis, when he is put on the spot by some Pharisees regarding the question of divorce. The Jewish law made provision for divorce. The only issue of debate among the religious leaders was the grounds for divorce. One school of thought favoured very lenient grounds; another school insisted on much stricter grounds. However, both schools followed the Jewish Law in asserting that it was only the man who could initiate divorce proceedings, whatever the grounds. The woman was not free to do the same. The divorce laws gave a freedom to men that it did not give to women, and it left women very vulnerable to being cut adrift by their husbands, for the flimsiest of reasons. In that context, Jesus’ teaching on marriage was intended to protect women. It reminded men of their obligation to love and honour their wives as they would their own body. Jesus went back beyond what the Jewish law allowed to God’s original intention as expressed in the Book of Genesis, according to which husband and wife are to become one in love, faithful to each other all the days of their lives. It is a wonderful vision for married life and, yet, we all know from experiences that people’s marriages don’t always reflect this vision of Jesus. Some marriages irretrievably break down. Jesus has a desire for all our lives, whether we are married or single; it is that we would love one another as he loves us. We don’t always live out of that vision of Jesus, but it is always worth striving towards, and if we open ourselves to the help of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord’ love, we will be empowered to give expression to this vision, at least from time to time. Whenever we do so, the kingdom of God is at hand.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(ii) Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn this morning’s gospel reading Matthew gives us Jesus’ teaching on marriage and celibacy. Even though within the Jewish tradition the Book of Deuteronomy allowed for divorce, Jesus refers back to the original intention of the Creator as expressed in the Book of Genesis, according to which the union between man and woman in marriage was to be enduring. We are all only too well aware that marriages break down. Many of us will know that from our own families. Yet if the church is to be faithful to the teaching of Jesus it must keep promoting God’s vision for marriage as the giving of a man and a woman to each other for life. Jesus also acknowledges the value of celibacy, for those to whom it has been granted, for those who have the graced capacity for celibacy from God. Jesus declares that it is a value given with a view to a greater value, God’s kingdom. It is to be lived for the sake of that kingdom, to further the coming of God’s kingdom and the doing of God’s will. Whether married or single we are all called to work together in the service of God’s purpose for our world and our lives, as revealed to us by Jesus.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iii) Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nThe opening verses of today’s gospel reading are often chosen as the gospel reading for a wedding Mass. They give us Jesus’ vision for married life, which goes back to the second chapter of the Book of Genesis, the first book in the Jewish Scriptures. According to this vision, a man and woman become one body in marriage, understanding body as the physical expression of the whole person. This vision of two individual lives becoming one shared life is what couples who come to be married in church aspire to, which is why this gospel reading speaks to them. Even though, in practice, those who come together in marriage do not always stay together, the vision for marriage that Jesus articulates remains God’s will for married life. Not everyone, of course, gets married or is called to marriage, as Jesus acknowledges in the concluding part of our gospel reading. Indeed, Jesus himself was not married. Married or single, we are all called to bring the Lord’s love into the world, to love others in ways that build communion or community. Insofar as we allow something of the Lord’s love to become flesh in us, the Lord will be able to continue his work through us. He once described that work as gathering together the scattered children of God, building communion among people.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(iv) Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nIn this morning’s gospel reading, the religious leaders are presented as testing Jesus. They were aware that his teaching often went much further than the Jewish law required, even, at times, to the point of undermining the Jewish law. On this occasion the Jewish leaders wanted to test how faithful Jesus was to the Jewish law on marriage. They suspected that Jesus’ teaching would go against what the Jewish law permitted in relation to marriage, namely, divorce in certain circumstances. Their suspicions were well founded. Jesus’ teaching on marriage was more radical than that of the Jewish law. He called on men and women to marry for life, and went back to the book of Genesis to support his teaching. We are all aware that many marriages do not last for life; relationships break down, and people go their separate ways. That is the reality. The gospels show that Jesus knew how to accept the reality of people’s lives; he engaged with people as they were. He relates to all of us in the concrete situation of our lives. Yet, he also shared God’s vision for human life, including married life. He proclaimed that vision while continuing to relate in a loving way to all who could not reach it, for whatever reason. That includes us all, because none of us lives up fully to the values Jesus proclaimed and lived. There will always be that two-fold aspect to Jesus’ relationship with us; he loves us where we are, but keeps calling us beyond where we are.\n\nAnd/Or\n\n(v) Friday, Nineteenth Week in Ordinary Time\n\nVery often in the gospels Jesus is presented as taking a much more relaxed attitude to the Jewish Law than the religious leaders of the time. He is much less strict about the Sabbath law of rest than they are, for example. Jesus heals on the Sabbath, even though this would have been considered work and, therefore, a violation of the Sabbath Law. When it comes to marriage and divorce, however, Jesus seems to have taken a more strict line than the religious leaders of the day. They understood, from the Book of Deuteronomy, that a man could divorce his wife, although a woman co"
