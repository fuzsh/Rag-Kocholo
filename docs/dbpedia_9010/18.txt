The brainchild of cosmic lo-fi Florida-born indie folk artist, Chad R. Matheny, Emperor X began his aural assault in the late '90s with the release of his debut, The Joytakers' Rakes/Stars on the Ceiling, Pleasantly Kneeling. Emperor X would go on to build a sizable grassroots audience in the U.S. and Europe through constant touring, quirky promotions that involved burying physical media in geocache sites, and a prolific string of releases including standouts like 2011's Western Teleport and 2017's Oversleepers International.
