Why does Berlin attract so many creative people? What is it about this city that draws in musicians — and keeps them there? Today, for our Sense of Place: Berlin series, we get to the heart of that question with American expat and musician Chad Matheny, who performs as Emperor X.

Chad's lived in Berlin for years and he takes us on a tour of some of the places that make Berlin feel so magical, like a unique park he visits often — Tempelhof Airport — a place, he says, that you want to go when you are in the middle of the city buy you want that shimmering feeling.

Emperor X explains where the magic of Berlin comes from, and how we could learn to make it here in America.
