        "text": "I‚Äôm so excited guys to tell you that fashionetpassion is getting a new look: new themes, categories and posts ideas. Yes!! Some new collaboration is coming. Anyway, in today‚Äôs post, I will give different makeup tips to get this professional makeup look. Personally, I think makeup complete your look .It reflects your personality and since we don‚Äôt have to time to go to a makeup artist each we go out, that‚Äôs why I will be bringing to you the makeup artist tips.\n\n1) Brushes: They are super important and make the look sounds more professional. Many makeup artists said that the quality of the brushes and products are equally important as the makeup skills. So make sure you buy a proper quality of brushes but that‚Äôs also doesn‚Äôt mean to spend a fortune on brushes. You should at least have the most basic brushes\n\n2) Contouring & Highlighting: As you probably noticed that this trend has been so popular lately. For the technique is easy: what you need to know is your face shape and when to highlight and where to contour. But the trick about is the blending. Many people are afraid to try it but trust once you apply it properly and nice you will love it. Actually, it makes people look different, defines your features and hides your imperfections. Per example: applying a bronzer around the outer edge of your prominent forehead will help by minimizing this area. In addition, contouring & highlighting can be done on budget, here‚Äôs what you need:\n\n3) Eye shadow Colors: when it comes to eye shadow colors, think opposite. Yes, choose the opposite color to your eye color; it helps them to stand out. So, here is a guide to know which eye shadow can enhance your eye color.\n\n4) Concealer: Not everyone use concealer but it is super important to hide all those dark circles, red spots and blemishes. The worst mistakes you should avoid while applying concealer: the right way to apply concealer is to draw a triangle and blend it. It‚Äôs called Hollywood Triangles‚Äô: Vshape from your outer to your inner corner. Never use your finger: When applying makeup, our hands touch a variety of other products, and when we finally get to our concealer, there might be remnants on your fingers, which can end up casting a shadow over your concealer. Save yourself the trouble and use a concealer brush for a flawless application. Choose the right shade: for dark circles go for a light liquid concealer. So choose wisely the texture and the quality.\n\n5) Angelina‚Äôs Lippies: Don‚Äôt we all want those full lips? Here is a tutorial how to get Angelina Jolie‚Äôs lips:\n\nStep1: Apply foundation to your entire lips. It helps you to realize where your lip lines actually are.\n\nStep2: Apply white pencil in the middle of your lips.\n\nStep3: Blend it nicely, apply some gloss and VOILAA.\n\n6) Eyebrows: First thing to say, never tattoo your eyebrows even if it‚Äôs very light. Always keep it natural. Now when you are lining your eyebrows, never overdo it: Like seriously I look at these girls lining their eyebrows by making them super thick, it‚Äôs ugly people. Stop doing it. Eyebrow liners are made to fill in the blank spaces and to define them and give them a nice look. One more step, don‚Äôt choose a darker shade than your hair‚Äôs, always go for the same shade. Finally, always blend after applying eyebrow pencil or powder.\n\nI hope this helped you!!\n\nThank u for reading\n\nDont forget to follow fashionetpassion, through all the social media to never miss a post :TWITTER || INSTAGRAM\n\nAs I promised that I am doing a holiday gift guide series.

As well as for the socks. Get them with a christmas pattern.\n\n3.Christmassy Sweater : Its a cute gift specially with this christmas pattern .. So festive.

This 90‚Äôs watch is simply gorgeous and INEXPENSIVE ( its for 100,000 L.L only in Lebanon)\n\nThank u for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDont forget to follow fashionetpassion, through all the social media to never miss a post : TWITTER || INSTAGRAM\n\nToday, its the independence day of Lebanon, my beloved country. Through, we don‚Äôt have a president and the situation is really bad, I decided to talk about a man who made us proud of him, who raised the lebanese flag everywhere. A person who became an inspiration for many of us. It‚Äôs the one and only : Maxime Chaya.\n\nHe may don‚Äôt sound familiar with u, so I will give some info about his bio.\n\nBiography:\n\nMaxime Edgard Chaya (born December 16, 1961) is a sportsman, mountaineer and explorer from Lebanon. On May 15, 2006, he was the first Lebanese to climb Mount Everest, completing the Seven Summits challenge.\n\nOn December 28, 2007, he also became the first from the Middle East to reach the South Pole on foot from the Antarctic coast, after an unsupported and unassisted journey that lasted 47 days. Then, on April 25, 2009, he was again the first from the region to reach the North Pole on foot, all the way from Canada\n\nIn doing so, he became the 16th person in history to complete the Three Poles Challenge. Last, Maxime is the 6th person in history to complete the Explorers Grand Slam.Since his partnership with Bank Audi on the ‚ÄúSeven Summits Project‚Äù in January 2003, it has been one successful expedition after another for Maxime, acquiring experience, knowledge and wisdom, while discovering new limits within him, and ‚ÄòGrowing Beyond His Potential‚Äô summit after summit.\n\nRecently, on August 5, 2013, Maxime beat the world record in rowing the Indian Ocean. The three adventurers, Maxime, the Faroese Livar Nysted and the British Stuart Kershaw crossed 5, 801,169 km from Geraldton in the east of Australia and rowed alternatively, during 57 days, 19 hours, 25 minutes and 52 seconds exactly. They were also the first crew of three to cross the Indian Ocean.\n\nAchievements:\n\nClimbed peaks and reached landmarks:\n\nMont Blanc (France)\n\nCho Oyu (Tibet / Nepal)\n\nMount Aspiring (New Zealand)\n\nThe Geographical North Pole (the Arctic Circle)\n\nThe South Pole (Antarctica)\n\nMount Ama Dablam (Nepal)\n\nThe Matterhorn (Switzerland / Italy) Climbed, and raised the Lebanese flag on all Seven Summits:\n\nMount Kilimanjaro ‚Äì 5,895m (Tanzania ‚Äì September 2001)\n\nMount McKinley/Denali ‚Äì 6,196m (Alaska ‚Äì June 2003)\n\nAconcagua ‚Äì 6,961m (Argentina ‚Äì January 2004)\n\nVinson Massif ‚Äì 4,892m (Antarctica ‚Äì December 2004)\n\nMount Elbrus ‚Äì 5,642m (Russia ‚Äì July 2005)\n\nCarstensz Pyramid ‚Äì 4,884m (Indonesia ‚Äì November 2005)\n\nMount Everest ‚Äì 8,848m (Tibet / Nepal ‚Äì May 2006)\n\nInspiration:\n\nMaxime regularly visits school, universities and clubs across the region delivering his presentation entitled: ‚ÄúThere is an Everest for Everyone‚Äù.On the independance day celebration, Maxime came to our school ‚Äù College Saint Maxime‚Äù. He showed us a presentation. Each situation he passed through, he learned something. He said that problems are everywhere, we can‚Äôt run away from them but the difference is how u solve the problems. Face it , think don‚Äôt panic. ..Every problem has his own solution. Then, he proved to us that whatever is your dream, by believing AND WORKING HARD u will do it. Seriously when u see the conditions that he was living in and how these conditions didn‚Äôt stop him from achieving his dream, U say that everything is possible. One more thing he said : that failure isn‚Äôt the end of the world it‚Äôs a chance to learn from our mistakes .. don‚Äôt stop and keep going\n\nThank u for reading ‚ù§Ô∏èüíê\n\nDont forget to follow fashionetpassion, through all the social media to never miss a post : TWITTER || INSTAGRAM"
