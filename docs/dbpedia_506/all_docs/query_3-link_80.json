        "text": "Summary: Chaya delivers inspiring presentation on 'Each one has a mountain to climb'\n\nImage Credit: Staff Report\n\nSharjah: A tale of adventure that was both inspiring and harrowing in equal measure was the basis of a panel discussion on the second day of Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF). Titled 'Each one of us has a mountain to climb,' the presentation was delivered by Maxime Chaya, a Lebanese mountaineer and pursuer of extreme activities.\n\nChaya was at SIBF as part of its Cultural Activities programme to show a video of his ascent of Mount Everest, a feat he achieved in 2006. The climb was the final one in his attempt to complete the Seven Summits - the ascent of the highest mountains in each of the seven continents. Naturally, the fact that Chaya successfully completed his goal was hugely inspiring, but the reality of what climbing entails was brought home to the audience when he described passing a man's body on the way to the top and another dying mountaineer on the way down.\n\nDespite the obvious serious risks involved, Chaya says that he takes part in such activities to both challenge himself and to inspire others to make the most of life. He has now successfully climbed the world's highest peaks around the world, has rowed across the Indian Ocean and has trekked to the South Pole and North Pole, the latter taking him a total of 53 days. Chaya has recorded his mountaineering feats in his book 'Steep Dreams' and has also written a comic book to inspire youngsters to live life to the full, which is titled 'Maximum Max'.\n\n[c] Al Nisr Publishing LLC 2017.
