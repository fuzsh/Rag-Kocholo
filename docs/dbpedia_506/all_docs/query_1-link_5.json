Then, Maxime fell in love with the desert and together with his ultra-endurance teammate, went on to complete the first unassisted crossing of a sand desert on a bicycle: the Empty Quarter (2016).\n\nBesides conferences to multinationals, Maxime gives of himself generously to the underprivileged and the youth of the region. He is in a perpetual state of adventure and discovery, currently as active as ever, preparing for yet another daunting expedition."
