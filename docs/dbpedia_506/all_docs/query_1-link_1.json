        "text": "Maxime Chaya\n\nCorporate Ambassador, Sportsman & Climber\n\nLebanon’s foremost sportsman and climber, Maxime Chaya was the first person from his home country to hoist its flag atop Everest.\n\nHe did so at the climax of his challenge to ascend the highest mountain on every continent – the Seven Summits – while also skiing to the North and South Poles. After his homeland’s civil war resulted in a multi-cultural Lebanese, French, Greek and Canadian education, Max graduated with honours from the London School of Economics, and today he regularly visits schools, universities and clubs to help motivate youngsters to ‘climb their own Everest’. Knighted twice for his achievements, Max lives on the Mediterranean coast, just north of his native Beirut, with his children Edgard and Kelly."
