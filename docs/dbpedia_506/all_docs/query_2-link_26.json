        "text": "Joseph G. Audi is Chairman of Interaudi Bank. Born in Saida, Lebanon from a family of bankers tracing its heritage back over generations, Joe founded the bank in New York in 1983 at the age of 33. Combining conservative banking traditions with innovative technology, the bank provides unique and personalized services on a global scale from its offices in New York and Miami. Over 40 years the bank has thrived despite turbulence in the world at large, from the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, to the recession of the 1990s, to the great financial crisis, to the Covid pandemic and the SVB crisis of 2023. The bank and its affiliates offer personalized banking and asset management services to an international clientele hailing from every continent. In an age of faceless megabanks, Interaudi has maintained its identity as a global bank with a family touch. Joe is a graduate of HEC Paris.\n\nSarah Beydoun is a Lebanese social entrepreneur whose vibrant and distinctive bags encapsulate the essence of Lebanese cultural elements. In May 2000, Beydoun launched Sarah’s Bag with the aim of empowering underprivileged\n\nwomen and female prisoners in Lebanon. Her inspiration originated from extensive field research during her graduate studies in sociology at the Université Saint Joseph in Beirut. While collaborating with Dar Al Amal, a local non-governmental organization dedicated to rehabilitating at-risk women and female ex-prisoners, she recognized the critical need to provide these women with opportunities for employment and financial independence. The stories of resilience she encountered deeply resonated with her, propelling her into action.\n\nEmpowered by the connections she formed with the prisoners, Beydoun embarked on a mission to provide tangible support by teaching incarcerated women embroidery skills. She initiated training programs in traditional embroidery and hand-beading crafts. Collaborating with a skilled handbag artisan, she breathed life into these canvases, skillfully transforming them into luxurious handcrafted bags. Notably, she established a groundbreaking system that enabled the women prisoners to offer training and employment to their friends and family in their hometowns after their release, thus creating clusters of artisans led by former prisoners. This innovative approach not only elevated their status but also facilitated their successful reintegration into society.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Beirut's iconic graffiti, pop culture, 1970s psychedelic art, and vibrant prints, Beydoun's creations have gained widespread recognition. Her designs have been featured on prestigious platforms like Net-A-Porter and Matches Fashion. Influential figures including HRH Queen Rania of Jordan, Beyoncé, and Amal Clooney have elegantly adorned her designs.\n\nIn 2016, Sarah Beydoun received the prestigious \"Business for Peace Award\" in Oslo, honoring her significant contribution to trust, stability, and peace-building through her business endeavors. This recognition underscored her unwavering commitment to peace.\n\nAmidst the challenges posed by the Lebanese economic collapse in 2019 and the Beirut Blast in 2020, the international luxury fashion house Chloe sought a collaborative partnership with Sarah’s Bag. This alliance not only demonstrated the brands' shared commitment to social empowerment but also solidified their dedication to the craft.\n\nBeydoun's journey stands as an inspiring testament to those who aspire to effect meaningful change through their passions and pursuits. Her impactful approach serves as a guiding light for anyone seeking to make a positive impact on the world. Beydoun's achievements have played a transformative role in the lives of more than 250 Lebanese underprivileged women, showcasing the enduring power of compassion.\n\nAmbassador Sahar Baassiri is a distinguished diplomat, journalist, lecturer and author.

And despite ongoing political and security pressures, the Beirut Marathon, now entering its 12th year, has become not only the largest running event in the Middle East, but a powerful force for peace.\n\nEl-Khalil was inspired to start the marathon after a personal tragedy: a near-fatal running accident. Doctors told her she would never run again. She was hospitalized for two years and had to undergo a long series of surgeries. But the resolve from this personal struggle created an event that, each year, draws runners and fans from opposing political and religious communities in a symbolic act of peace. Just last November, more than 36,000 athletes from all over the world ran for Lebanon.\n\nMaxime Edgard Chaya was born and raised in Beirut until the year 1975 when the civil war saw him and his family take refuge abroad. He pursued his education overseas in Greece, France, Canada and the United Kingdom, graduating with a Bachelor of Science Honors degree from the London School of Economics (LSE).\n\nChaya then spent a year as a trainee at Republic National Bank of New York's head office on Fifth Avenue before foregoing post-graduate studies and returning home to take over the family's Foreign Exchange business. In 1999, he founded his own company VO2max, and through it, organized races and competitions for Lebanese youth of all ages. Cycling, both road and Mountain Bike, triathlon, road running, trail-running, rock climbing, ski touring and freeride were all part of the VO2MAX challenge series of events from 1999 to 2003.\n\nBesides organizing events for others, and the youth in particular, Chaya showed great interest in competing personally, and seemed to excel in every discipline he would adopt. Despite the lack of professional training and advice (his country was at war), his rigorous training, coupled with unfailing determination, perseverance and willpower won him several awards and trophies in a host of disciplines both at national and international level.\n\nChaya now resides in Lebanon with his two children: Edgard and Kelly. Despite work and family life, he has kept his fitness level at the very top but has gradually put down his rackets, skates, and various balls to take up more open air sports such as trail running, biking, backcountry skiing, and climbing.\n\nSince his partnership with Bank Audi on the “Seven Summits Project” in January 2003, it has been one successful expedition after another for Chaya, acquiring experience, knowledge and wisdom, while discovering new limits within him, and ‘Growing Beyond His Potential’ summit after summit.\n\nRecently, on August 5, 2013, Chaya beat the world record in rowing the Indian Ocean. The three adventurers, Chaya, the Faroese Livar Nysted and the British Stuart Kershaw crossed 5,801 kilometers (3,132 nmi) from Geraldton in the east of Australia and rowed alternatively, during 57 days, 19 hours, 25 minutes and 52 seconds exactly. They were also the first crew of three to cross the Indian Ocean."
