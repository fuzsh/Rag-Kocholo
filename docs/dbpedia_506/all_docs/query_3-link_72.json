        "text": "Bank Audi’s Corporate Ambassador, Maxime Chaya, is currently on a nationwide tour to schools and universities with the purpose of motivating Lebanese youth to pursue their dreams and work hard to achieve their full potential. Chaya also delivers motivational speeches entitled 'There is an Everest for Everyone' to multinational corporations, both locally and abroad. Maxime is currently finalising an inspirational 500-page book that includes more than 700 spectacular, full colour photos. “Steep Dreams; A Journey to the Top of the World” will be on the shelves in October 2009.\n\n\"When you aim for the summit, you don’t count the steps.\"\n\nWhat kills you most?\n\nCorruption, lying and negligence.\n\nWhat gets you up in the morning?\n\nPassion.\n\nWhat happened to your childhood dreams?\n\nThey are on their way to be fulfilled 100 percent.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from others?\n\nFaith perhaps?\n\nWhat do you need most?\n\nThe grace of God.\n\nDo you think that anyone can become an artist?\n\nNo, but there’s no harm in trying our very best, otherwise, we’ll never know!\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nPlanet Earth.\n\nDo you feel your situation is enviable?\n\nCertainly not my financial one!\n\nWhat have you given up on?\n\nNothing.\n\nWhat do you do with your money?\n\nWhat money?\n\nWhat moves you?\n\nThe injustice in this world.\n\nWhat are your favourite pleasures?\n\nInspiring others, especially the young generation.\n\nWhat would you like to receive for your birthday?\n\nA trip to space.\n\nName three living artists that you hate most?\n\nI don’t hate anyone. Definitely not artists, past or present.\n\nWhat or whom do you defend?\n\nMy values.\n\nWhat are you capable of refusing?\n\nAnything I deem immoral.\n\nWhat are you capable of doing in the name of love?\n\nNothing I wouldn’t do otherwise.\n\nWhat are you blamed for?\n\nI don’t know... You tell me!\n\nWhat does art bring to you?\n\nPleasure, although not as much as it should, perhaps.\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nSomeone who, without regretting it, had the guts to follow his dreams all the way, as well as the humility to follow orders along the way.\n\nWhat drives you nuts?\n\nThe daily crimes committed against the environment.\n\nWrite your own epitaph?\n\nGosh! I never thought anyone would ask that one! Off the top of my head, I would write: “Adventurer, currently paying tribute to his lifelong guide.”\n\nUnder what form would you like to come back as?\n\nEither a dolphin or an eagle.\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\nMine! ‘Steep Dreams: My Journey to the Top of the World’ (currently being proofread, and about to be printed very soon.)\n\nDo you like animals?\n\nOf course I do!\n\nWhy did you choose to be the image of Bank Audi?\n\nIt is more like Bank Audi chose me to represent it, and that is perhaps because it felt that I embody its vision, and its slogan ‘Grow Beyond your Potential’.\n\nWho is the woman of your dreams?\n\nI haven’t really found her yet, but I must admit that being so busy fulfilling my other dreams, I haven’t looked very hard yet.\n\nWhat is your philosophy in life?\n\nI am not a philosopher – far from it - but if you insist, I would say: ‘When you aim for the summit, you don’t count the steps.’\n\nWhat is the most important thing in your life?\n\nThe health, and well-being of my family.\n\nTalk to an alien, or draw an alien.\n\nI’m not much of an artist, so I would rather talk than draw. Accordingly, I would say: “7owell!” (literally meaning “divert!”, a Lebanese rural expression meaning “come in for coffee!”)."
