        "text": "5 - Year sponsorship deal between Hesco and Jebel Ali Dragons\n\n700 - Dubai Hurricanes had more than 700 playing members last season between their mini and youth, men's and women's teams\n\nDh600,000 - Dubai Exiles' budget for pitch and court hire next season, for their rugby, netball and cricket teams\n\nDh1.8m - Dubai Hurricanes' overall budget for next season\n\nDh2.8m - Dubai Exiles’ overall budget for next season\n\nSome facts about bees:\n\nThe queen bee eats only royal jelly, an extraordinary food created by worker bees so she lives much longer\n\nThe life cycle of a worker bee is from 40-60 days\n\nA queen bee lives for 3-5 years\n\nThis allows her to lay millions of eggs and allows the continuity of the bee colony\n\nAbout 20,000 honey bees and one queen populate each hive\n\nHoney is packed with vital vitamins, minerals, enzymes, water and anti-oxidants.\n\nApart from honey, five other products are royal jelly, the special food bees feed their queen\n\nPollen is their protein source, a super food that is nutritious, rich in amino acids\n\nBeewax is used to construct the combs. Due to its anti-fungal, anti-bacterial elements, it is used in skin treatments\n\nPropolis, a resin-like material produced by bees is used to make hives. It has natural antibiotic qualities so works to sterilize hive, protects from disease, keeps their home free from germs. Also used to treat sores, infection, warts\n\nBee venom is used by bees to protect themselves. Has anti-inflammatory properties, sometimes used to relieve conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, nerve and muscle pain\n\nHoney, royal jelly, pollen have health enhancing qualities\n\nThe other three products are used for therapeutic purposes\n\nIs beekeeping dangerous?\n\nAs long as you deal with bees gently, you will be safe, says Mohammed Al Najeh, who has worked with bees since he was a boy.\n\n“The biggest mistake people make is they panic when they see a bee. They are small but smart creatures. If you move your hand quickly to hit the bees, this is an aggressive action and bees will defend themselves. They can sense the adrenalin in our body. But if we are calm, they are move away.”\n\nTrans fat is typically found in fried and baked goods, but you may be consuming more than you think.\n\nPowdered coffee creamer, microwave popcorn and virtually anything processed with a crust is likely to contain it, as this guide from Mayo Clinic outlines:\n\nBaked goods - Most cakes, cookies, pie crusts and crackers contain shortening, which is usually made from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Ready-made frosting is another source of trans fat.\n\nSnacks - Potato, corn and tortilla chips often contain trans fat. And while popcorn can be a healthy snack, many types of packaged or microwave popcorn use trans fat to help cook or flavour the popcorn.\n\nFried food - Foods that require deep frying — french fries, doughnuts and fried chicken — can contain trans fat from the oil used in the cooking process.\n\nRefrigerator dough - Products such as canned biscuits and cinnamon rolls often contain trans fat, as do frozen pizza crusts.\n\nCreamer and margarine - Nondairy coffee creamer and stick margarines also may contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils."
