        "text": "From Lebanon to the North Pole\n\nMaxime Chaya to Take Up a New Challenge: Skiing Unassisted, All the Way to the North Pole\n\nIn May 2006, while completing his “Seven Summits” quest to climb the highest mountain on every continent, Maxime Chaya became a national hero by raising his country’s flag for the first time in history on the rooftop of the world: Mount Everest. Then, in December 2008, he proudly planted Lebanon’s flag at the South Pole after 47 days of unassisted, unsupported skiing from the Antarctic coast, a challenge achieved by only very few people. Today, Maxime is about to undertake a new journey.\n\nIn a press conference held on February 18, Maxime confirmed his intention to once again test his commitment, determination and endurance by skiing over 800 km to the North Pole from the northern tip of Canada, thus completing his “Three Poles” odyssey which has also included Everest and the South Pole."
