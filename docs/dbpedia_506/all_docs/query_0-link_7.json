        "text": "Today, its the independence day of Lebanon, my beloved country. Through, we don’t have a president and the situation is really bad, I decided to talk about a man who made us proud of him, who raised the lebanese flag everywhere. A person who became an inspiration for many of us. It’s the one and only : Maxime Chaya.\n\nHe may don’t sound familiar with u, so I will give some info about his bio.\n\nBiography:\n\nMaxime Edgard Chaya (born December 16, 1961) is a sportsman, mountaineer and explorer from Lebanon. On May 15, 2006, he was the first Lebanese to climb Mount Everest, completing the Seven Summits challenge.\n\nOn December 28, 2007, he also became the first from the Middle East to reach the South Pole on foot from the Antarctic coast, after an unsupported and unassisted journey that lasted 47 days. Then, on April 25, 2009, he was again the first from the region to reach the North Pole on foot, all the way from Canada\n\nIn doing so, he became the 16th person in history to complete the Three Poles Challenge. Last, Maxime is the 6th person in history to complete the Explorers Grand Slam.Since his partnership with Bank Audi on the “Seven Summits Project” in January 2003, it has been one successful expedition after another for Maxime, acquiring experience, knowledge and wisdom, while discovering new limits within him, and ‘Growing Beyond His Potential’ summit after summit.\n\nRecently, on August 5, 2013, Maxime beat the world record in rowing the Indian Ocean. The three adventurers, Maxime, the Faroese Livar Nysted and the British Stuart Kershaw crossed 5, 801,169 km from Geraldton in the east of Australia and rowed alternatively, during 57 days, 19 hours, 25 minutes and 52 seconds exactly. They were also the first crew of three to cross the Indian Ocean.\n\nAchievements:"
