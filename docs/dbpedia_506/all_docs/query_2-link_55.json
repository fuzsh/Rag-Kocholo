        "text": "IT WAS 5.55 in the morning, May the 15th. The place was shrouded in an eerie silence. It wasn't pitch dark. A hint of light was emerging across the horizon. Winds howled. A searing, unimaginable cold enveloped the setting.\n\nThen quietly, the sun peeped over a mountaintop far off in the east and shot a laser beam of blinding light, first flooding the northeast ridge, then illuminating countless snow-covered peaks, and revealing, in its lofty majesty, a wonder-filled, breathtaking panorama.\n\nMax Chaya, a 45-year-old father of two young children, had just seen something that no one ever gets to see and fewer even dream about: sunrise from the top of the world's highest peak: Mount Everest.\n\n'That image is imprinted inside my eyelids,' recalled Chaya, the first Lebanese to scale the Everest and only the second from the Middle East, who became a mountain climber late in life, by accident. 'It was like sitting on the wing of an airplane, feet dangling in the air, and looking down. I could see the curvature of the earth. All the peaks, which are huge, were dwarfed by the Everest. It was amazing.'\n\nHe paused. 'Come to think of it... 8850 metres, the height of the Everest. That's the height of the plane that will bear me home tomorrow,' said Chaya, who was in Dubai recently. 'Don't you get goose pimples just thinking about it?'\n\nBut Chaya pointed out that there was no rejoicing. 'I felt serious. You don't rejoice at the Summit, because that's only half the distance. You've to stay focused because you have to come back. Most climbers die coming back,' he said. 'But I was happy and thankful to get to the Summit in good form and in good time. And I was proud to raise the flag of my country at the Everest.'\n\nThe expedition that Chaya was part of in May 2006 was documented by Discovery Channel from start to finish, in one of the deadliest and most controversial seasons on record. It had 11 climbers, with Russell Brice of New Zealand as the expedition leader, 24 Sherpas and camp crew, 3 professional mountain guides and 17 people on the television production team. Filmed over 52 days, the 6-part series, Everest: Beyond the Limit was aired in April and May this year.\n\nOn to the top\n\nChaya was the first to reach the Summit, so eager was he that he had shot ahead of others. 'When I left the last camp at 8400 meters, it was very very cold,' he recalled. 'And when it's that cold, you have to minimise your exposure to the cold. So, I told myself: I have to go to the Summit as quickly as possible and come back as quickly as possible.'\n\nChaya said his camp mate Gerard, a Frenchman, also left with him for the Summit, but took a long time and had to return. 'There's a turnaround time,' said Chaya. 'If you don't reach the summit by 11 in the morning you've to come back. Otherwise, you 're forced to sleep out in the freezing cold, which means certain death.' Gerard ended up exposing himself to the cold and lost 16 of his digits to frostbite.\n\nA national hero\n\nMaxime Edgard Chaya, popularly known as Max, was born and raised in Lebanon, a country where he is now lionised as a hero. Thousands flocked to the airport to receive him after his Everest triumph.\n\nHe was knighted, as Officer of the National Order of the Cedar. A postage stamp is being released in his honour.\n\n'I never imagined the response would be so fantastic,' he said. 'When I was a kid I used to hear these names and get fascinated, the Andes, the Himalayas, the Everest...I used to wonder if I'd ever get to see them, let alone climb them.'\n\nTall, square-shouldered, lean with a muscular frame and a terrific sense of humour, Max Chaya is as unlikely a national hero as he was a mountain climber. In 1999, he founded his own outdoor gear company VO2MAX, and through it organised races and competitions for Lebanese youth of all ages. Although a sportsman and biking enthusiast himself, he had never before climbed a big mountain in his life. In 2000, while on a visit to Kenya for an International Mountain Bike stage race that he won, he was invited to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in nearby Tanzania.\n\nSo he did, and was hooked. 'After Kilimanjaro, I wanted to push it farther,' he recalled. He went to Europe and climbed several mountains including the Mont Blanc. It was there that he first came to know about the Seven Summits, the highest peak on each of the seven continents. 'So I said to myself, I've to do this,' he said. 'At that time, I knew I had to climb the highest mountain at some point. So I left it for the last because it was the hardest.'\n\nBefore coming to the Everest, he climbed the rest of the Seven Summits: Kilimanjaro in November 2001, Mount McKinley in Alaska in June 2003, Aconcagua in Argentina in January 2004, Kosciusko in Australia in April 2004, Vinson Massif in Antarctica in December 2004 and Elbrus in Russia-Georgia in July 2005. To prepare for the Everest, he\n\nclimbed 14 big mountains including Cho Oyu, at 8201 meters the sixth highest mountain in the world.\n\nDeath Zone on the mountain\n\nMax said the wind, the weather, is the most treacherous part of the Everest climb. 'If it's minus 10 degrees, with a little wind it goes to minus 18 right away. If there's more wind the temperature just goes down,' he said. The Summit is attempted only when meteorologists give the climbers what they call Everest window, clear good weather. The 1996 tragedy, which claimed 8 lives in one day on the Everest, resulted because the weather suddenly worsened. Said Max, 'You don't choose the day to climb the Everest. God chooses it.'\n\nOn the Everest, the area above 25000 feet is called the Death Zone. 'You cannot drink or sleep or eat well there. Your body starts eating itself up, and shutting down some unimportant organs because there is not enough oxygen for all the organs,' said Max. '25000 feet is where aircrafts fly. Man is not supposed to be there.'\n\nWhich is why, he explained, you have to stay focused going up and coming down, pay attention to your body, like numbness in some limb which could be the beginning of frostbite. 'You have to keep cool and think your way through your problems as soon as they develop. And thinking at that altitude is difficult because your brain is not getting enough oxygen.'\n\nDid he ever feel fear on his climb? 'You can't afford to let yourself be scared on Everest,' he explained. 'If you're scared, you lose time and effort and resources that you can use to solve whatever problem you are in.'\n\nHis scariest moment on the Everest came at 8100 meters when his Sherpa, who was climbing just ahead of him, suddenly slipped on the ice. The Sherpa's clamp-on, attached to his boot, swished past Chaya's face, a centimetre away. 'My face would've been ripped off,' said Chaya. 'And that would've been the end of me.'\n\nWhen asked why over 50 per cent of climbers die on the Everest on their way down, Max explained, 'They die because they spend all of their energies going up, and there's nothing left to go back. So you've to arrive at the summit in good form, and leave some juice inside you. And though coming down is a litter easier than going up, you can make mistakes, which can prove more fatal on the down path.'\n\nA whole team goes to the Everest. So when asked why do climbers die when others are around to help, Max said, 'Up there, it is the Death Zone. On ground, if something happens to you, I can carry you on my shoulders to the nearest hospital. Up there, if a climber can't stand on his own two feet, then you can't help him. You can barely walk yourself, how are you going to carry another person? It's the sheer height of the Everest that is so deadly and takes a lot out of you. If something goes wrong there, it goes wrong in a big way. So, you must solve problems as soon as they develop.'\n\nMax said the hardest part of going to the Everest was parting with his family. 'Leaving my family and going there knowing that there's a chance I may not come back,' he said. 'And that means my children would've to grow up without a father, which is not a very nice thing.'\n\nA life changing experience\n\nMax pointed out that the experience has changed him forever. 'After the Everest, I'm not the same person, that's for sure,' he said. 'It has made me look at life differently. It has humbled me, made me feel tiny as compared to everything else on earth. The biggest lesson I learnt was: yes, there are problems in life but problems have solutions. As long as you're are facing a problem, it's okay, so long as it is not a catastrophe, which is a problem without a solution. And many a times, the solution turns out to be simple.'\n\nWhich is why, he said, he's motivating the young people now. 'I tell them, there is an Everest for everyone, and it doesn't have to be climbing the mountain. Everyone has a dream and if you work hard enough and if you solve all the problems along the way - and there invariably will be problems - you will fulfill your dream.'\n\nFor those who aspire to scale the Everest some day, he recommends lot of cardiovascular training, like running, swimming, biking, rock climbing. 'Most importantly, you need experience on the mountains,' he said. 'You start with smaller mountains before going on to bigger ones. Yes, you have to earn your way through the mountains.'\n\nMax said sometimes it's good to get out of your comfort zone, so when you come back to it, life is so much sweeter. 'I've done it and I came back with all my fingers intact. It feels great. Life has a different taste for me now. And I'm thankful for everything that I have. This cup of tea, for example. Do you know how long it takes to make a cup of tea on the Everest?' he asked.\n\n'You have to wear your gloves, go out of your tent with ice pack and gloves and scoop up ice and bring it back inside the tent and light up the stove. Then you have to melt the ice, boil the tea in the water for a long time because water boils only at 80 degrees up there. That takes about an hour and half to make a cup of tea. So, a cup of tea tastes a lot better now than before I went there.'\n\nBut when asked, why do it? Why risk it at all, especially the Everest, he laughed and said, 'Of course, you know the standard answer, 'Because it is there!' He paused, then said, 'Firstly, why not? Okay, granted you could lose your life attempting it. But then so could you, just crossing the street, or in your bathtub at home. Secondly, because I had said to myself I have to do it. I challenged myself to do it. I thought, if others could do it, why couldn't I?'\n\nHis feat has been so singular that Max is currently working on a book, titled My Journey to the Top. He has already written the first chapter, and he hopes to finish it by November this year.\n\nLooking back on his extraordinary feat, Max Chaya said, 'I'll never forget that sunrise,'\n\nThen he joked, 'Maybe one day when I'm old and crossing a street with a walker, a kid comes along and helps me across the street, little would he know I've been to the highest peak in the world.'"
