        "text": "After recovering from his 'Everesting for charity' in Oct. 2020, Max felt like pushing that cycling concept further.\n\nHaving climbed the actual Seven Summits on foot, Max, who is a biker at heart, conceived the following challenge:\n\npick seven hill segments, anywhere, then cycle up and down each hill on seven consecutive days.\n\nRepeat the required number of times until, every day, the total positive ascent equals the altitude of one of the Seven Summits.\n\nNote 1: 'Everesting' is an activity in which cyclists ascend and descend a given hill multiple times, in order to have cumulatively climbed 8,848 m (the elevation of Mt. Everest).\n\nNote 2: The Seven Summits are the highest peak on each continent (Kosciusko version).\n\nNote 3: The week can commence on any day - with each day starting at midnight.\n\nNote 4: The order of the summits is discretionary."
