        "text": "Lebanon’s foremost sportsman and adventurer, Maxime Chaya was the first person from his country to hoist its flag atop Everest (2006). Besides achieving the Seven Summits -the highest mountain on every continent- Max also skied to the South Pole (2007) and North Pole (2009), unassisted and all the way from the coast.\n\nMax then took to the high seas and, together with his two crew-mates, he rowed across the Indian Ocean (2013), earning a Guinness World speed record. Then, Maxime fell in love with the desert and together with his ultra-endurance teammate, went on to complete the first unassisted crossing of a sand desert on a bicycle: the Empty Quarter (2016). Besides conferences to multinationals, Maxime gives of himself generously to the underprivileged and the youth of the region. He is in a perpetual state of adventure and discovery, currently as active as ever, preparing for yet another daunting expedition."
