        "text": "With the help of his dear dog and companion, Pepper, Maxime Chaya will be representing Lebanon for the international canicross championship this fall. Chaya is a Lebanese sportsman, mountaineer and explorer. On May 15, 2006, he became the first Lebanese to climb Mount Everest, completing the Seven Summits challenge. However, the adventure is far from over for him.\n\nAfter attempting to combine running and spending quality time with his dog, the sportsman tells us how he went from there to an international competition. By attaching his dog to his hip to go for a run, Chaya discovered his passion for a sport that he was convinced should already be popular amongst sportsmen.\n\nChaya believes that canicross is a sport that not only challenges your body by making you run even more but an activity that strengthens the bond between humans and their dogs. According to him, dogs will begin to understand you better and will anticipate your next move over time. Equipped with special gear, Chaya even practiced this type of sport using a bike (bikejoring) and skis (skijoring).\n\nHowever, an unexpected accident occurred while bikejoring with his dog. Pepper accelerated unexpectedly and caught the sportsman off-guard. This accident left Chaya with a broken hip. While recovering in the hospital, he discovered that there were real international championships for canicross and was invited by the ICF (International Canicross Federation).\n\nLuckily, Chaya managed to recover just in time for the competition that was held in France, and he won the silver medal for Lebanon, a guest country at the time. “My broken hip did not happen to me, it happened for me,” he said in the conference he held on August 1.\n\nStill accompanied by his faithful companion Pepper, Chaya is currently preparing to compete in the upcoming international canicross championships scheduled for October and November in Italy and Spain. Chaya is persistently pushing Lebanon to join the ICF as a participant and not a guest country, as no competitor from guest countries can become a champion in this case."
