He who has explored its every nook and cranny: from the North Pole to the South Pole, from Earth’s highest summit (Mount Everest at 8,850 m) to its vastest expanses of water (rowing across the Indian Ocean, in 57 days) and harshest deserts (cycling across the Empty Quarter without assistance, in 21 days).\n\nThis second volume of the adventures of Maximum Max tells how this extreme sportsman, just back from Kilimanjaro, next attempts three more peaks of the Seven Summits challenge: Russia’s Mount Elbrus, the tallest in Europe; Argentina’s Aconcagua, the highest in South America; and, finally, Alaska’s Denali, the loftiest mountain of North America.\n\nDetermined to always move onwards and upwards, our hero will encounter hardships that compel him to draw on all his physical and mental resources to surpass himself."
