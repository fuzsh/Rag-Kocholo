        "text": "episode 14 - Maxime Chaya\n\nHusky International · 2015-06-01\n\n01:12:34\n\nOne of the best things with Husky is all the chances and opportunities that so often opens up. Who would have thought that I would get an e-mail from the husband of the Swedish ambassador to Lebanon telling me that they not only listen to Husky, but also asks if I would be interested in meeting a friend of theirs - Maxime Chaya, who is the sixth person in the world ever to have completed the so called Adventurers Grand Slam which is completing the Seven Summits AND crossing the North and the South Pole on foot.I am so glad and humbled to have had the chance to meet and interview Maxime about his background in Lebanon, his cosmopolitan upbringing, about his adventures and his mission to be a good rolemodel and ambassador for a troubled part of the world. He has also written a autobiography about his life so far called Steep Dreams.\n\nHosted on Acast.
