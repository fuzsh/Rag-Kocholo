        "text": "Animals Lebanon rescued a stray dog from Beirut after he was shot at close range. The pup was flown to the U.S. and taken in by Sweet Paws Rescue in Massachusetts. The two-year-old dog, who was named Luke, survived the gunshot wound but had significant damage to his face. The Sweet Paws Rescue team asked for advice from veterinarians in their area regarding how to repair the damage, and sought assistance from Dr. Mike Pavletic, who is the head of surgery at the MSPCA’s Angell Animal Medical Center.\n\nAccording to Dr. Pavletic after examining Luke, it was surprising that the pup survived the injury. Dr. Pavletic further explained that Luke had been breathing through a hole in his snout because his nasal passages were seared closed as a result of the gunshot. Fortunately, Dr. Pavletic was able to perform surgery to repair the damage to Luke’s face which will help him to both breathe and eat comfortably, using some of the tissue from Luke’s hip to cover the hole in his skull and rebuild his nose. Luke was later discharged to a foster home, where he could recover while seeking a forever home.\n\nBeirut Luna Park is a park in this ancient city where one can spend some downtime. Luna is also the name of a German Shepherd Husky mix who fell off of a fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean north of San Diego, miles from shore. Luna was reported missing by her owner, Nick Haworth, a fisherman. He explained to the authorities that Luna was a strong swimmer and that she would likely head toward land. The nearest shoreline, however, was San Clemente Island, where there is a U.S. naval facility, about two miles from where Luna entered the water. Staff of the naval facility helped Haworth look on the island for Luna; however, they did not find her. After a few days of searching the island and no sign of Luna, she was considered lost at sea and presumed dead.\n\nAmazingly, after five weeks, Luna appeared on the island near the naval installation. Crew members arriving for work noticed the pup, sitting on the side of the road wagging her tail. It is thought that Luna swam to shore and made it on her own for five weeks. After being checked by a veterinarian she was determined to be slightly malnourished but healthy and not injured. It is believed that she survived by eating mice. According to a Facebook post by Haworth, he is “beyond stoked to have Luna back. I always knew she was a warrior”."
