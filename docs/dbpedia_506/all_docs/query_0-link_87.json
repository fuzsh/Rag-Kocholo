        "text": "Timeline\n\n1921: First expedition\n\nThe first British expedition, under the leadership of Colonel Charles Howard-Bury and the mountaineering leader, Harold Raeburn, including George Mallory, Guy Bullock and Edward Oliver Wheeler. It was primarily for mapping and reconnaissance as to ascertain if a route to the summit of Mount Everest could be found from the north (Tibetan) side. As the health of Raeburn broke down, Mallory assumed responsibility for most of the exploration to the north and east of the mountain, and became the first Westerner to put foot on the Everest massive. They reached the North Col of Everest at 7,066 m (23,000 ft) before being forced back. Still to Mallory’s experienced eye, the route ahead from there to the summit looked long, but feasible for a fresher party.\n\n1922: First attempt\n\nThe second British expedition, under General Charles Granville Bruce and climbing leader Lt-Col. Edward Lisle Strutt, and containing George Mallory, return for a full-scale attempt on the mountain. On May 22nd, they climb to 8,170 m (26,800 ft) on the North Ridge before retreating. A day later, George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce climb up the North Ridge and Face to 8,320 m (27,300 ft) using oxygen. On June 7, George Mallory leads a third attempt but sets off an avalanche, killing seven Sherpa climbers, becoming the first reported deaths on Everest.\n\n1924: Mallory and Irvine\n\nThe third British expedition, again lead by Charles Granville Bruce that is indisposed due to a flare-up of malaria and relinquish leadership of the expedition to Lt. Col Edward Norton and thus George Mallory being promoted to climbing leader. Geoffrey Bruce, Howard Somervell, and John Noel return from the previous year, along with newcomers Noel Odell and Andrew Irvine. On June 4, Norton and Somervell attempted an oxygenless summit, Somervell was forced to abandon the climb at about 28,000 feet while Norton continued on alone and finally reached a height of 8,573 m (28,126 ft), just 275 m (900 ft) short of the summit.\n\nOn June 8, Mallory and Irvine attempt the summit using oxygen and Irvine’s modified oxygen apparatus, from which they never returned. Odell, climbing in support below, wrote in his diary that he “saw Mallory & Irvine on the ridge, nearing base of final pyramid” at 12:50 p.m. that day. Later in his life, he said that what he believed were Mallory and Irvine were actually just rocks and that he only thought they had been moving. His statements and what he really saw are still being debated today. In 1979 climber Wang Hongbao of China revealed to a companion that he had discovered a body in 1975 thought at the time to be Irvine’s, but he was killed in a fall the next day before he could provide precise details to anyone else.\n\nIn 1999, however, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory’s body in the predicted search area near the old Chinese camp. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community as to whether the duo may have summited 29 years before the confirmed ascent (and of course, safe descent) of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. The general consensus among climbers has been that they did not, though recent findings may indicate otherwise. Though there is no physical evidence of either man above the Second Step, there is speculation that if Mallory had made it that far he likely summitted, as there are no difficult technical climbs further up. The leading theory amongst those supporting the summit theory has Mallory tackling the sheer face of the Second Step by standing on Irvine’s shoulders. Armed with Irvine’s spare oxygen tanks he could have summitted late in the day. Descending in darkness he may have decided to take the Norton Couloir rather than attempt down-climbing the Second Step in the dark. Almost everyone agrees Mallory died in a short fall during his descent through the couloir, where his body was found. Irvine probably briefly survived him as he awaited his companion’s return, at the foot of the Second Step, but died later of exposure. Irvine’s body was probably found by another Chinese climber in 1960 (nowhere near Mallory’s, proving the two had separated) but has not been rediscovered since, despite several searches in 2004.\n\nMallory had gone on a speaking tour of the United States the year before in 1923; it was then that he exasperatedly gave the famous reply, “Because it is there,” to a New York journalist in response to hearing the question, “Why climb Everest?” for seemingly the thousandth time. Comprehensive information is available at Mallory and Irvine: The Final Chapter including critical opposing viewpoints.\n\nIn 1995, George Mallory II of South Africa (his grandson) reached the summit of Everest.\n\n1933\n\nLady Houston, a British millionaire ex-showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the summit in an effort to deploy the British Union Jack flag at the top.\n\n1934\n\nMaurice Wilson, a British eccentric, stated his intention to summit Everest by himself. Extraordinarily, after only a few flying lessons, Wilson flew illegally from Britain to India, hiking through Darjeeling and into Tibet and with the help of a couple of Sherpa guides began his attempt. Maurice Wilson’s body was found one year later, in 1935, by another expedition. The fates of Wilson’s Sherpa guides are unknown and it is generally accepted that Wilson and his group made it above 8,000 meters before succumbing to the altitude. In 1960, a Chinese expedition on the North-Col, North-East ridge route claimed to have found the remains of an “old tent” at approx. 8,500 meters, just 300 meters from the summit. In 1960 the highest known camp on Everest Tibetan-side was at 8,300 meters.\n\nA Tibetan named Gombu, himself a summiteer on the 1960 expedition confirmed the find, when in 1985, he emphatically answered in the affirmative after being asked the question twice. It must however be noted that whilst climbers from the Chinese expedition are on record, no such camp has ever been seen or found in the years since and most climbers are known to be somewhat sceptical to this “record”.\n\n1938\n\nAfter taking part in the 1935 reconnaissance expedition, the prolific British mountaineering explorer Bill Tilman was appointed leader of the 1938 Everest expedition which attempted the ascent via the north west ridge. They reached over 27,000 ft (8,200 m) without supplemental oxygen before being forced down due to bad weather and sickness.\n\n1947\n\nIn 1947 An eccentric Englishman Earl Denman, Tenzing Norgay & Ange Dawa Sherpa entered Tibet illegally to attempt the mountain; the attempt ended when a strong storm at 22,000 ft pounded them. Denman admitted defeat and all three turned around and safely returned.\n\n1950\n\nNepal opens its borders to foreigners. Earlier expeditions had ascended the mountain from Tibet, via the north face. However, this access was closed to western expeditions in 1950, after the Chinese reasserted control over Tibet. However, in 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.\n\n1951\n\nA British expedition led by Eric Shipton and including Edmund Hillary, travelled into Nepal to survey a new route via the southern face.\n\n1952\n\nA Swiss expedition attempted to climb via the southern face, but the assault team of Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay turned back 200 meters short of the summit. The Swiss attempted another expedition in the autumn of 1952; this time a team including Lambert and Tenzing turned back at an earlier stage in the climb.\n\n1953: Tenzing and Hillary\n\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair turned back after becoming exhausted high on the mountain. The next day, the expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with its fittest and most determined climbing pair. The summit was eventually reached at 11:30 a.m. local time on May 29, 1953 by the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal climbing the South Col Route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first. They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending. News of the expedition’s success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation. Returning to Kathmandu a few days later, Hillary and Hunt discovered that they had been promptly knighted for their effort.\n\n1960: The North Ridge\n\nOn May 25, a Chinese team consisting of Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua and a Tibetan, Gingbu (Konbu) (assisted by Australian Daniel Rattner) makes the first summit via the North Ridge.\n\n1963\n\nFirst ascent by an American: Jim Whittaker; first ascent of the West Ridge on May 22 by Americans Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld.\n\nFirst crossing by a United States expedition, starting from the west and descending over the south-west.\n\n1965\n\nOn May 20, Nawang Gombu becomes the first person to reach the summit of Everest twice, once with American and then with Indian expedition.\n\n21-man Indian expedition, led by Lieutenant Commander M.S. Kohli, succeeded in putting nine men on the summit of Everest. Nawang Gombu, belonged to the same expedition.\n\n1975\n\nOn May 16, Junko Tabei of Japan is the first woman on the crest.\n\nOn May 27, a Tibetan woman, Phantog, becomes the first woman to reach the summit from the Tibetan side.\n\nThe British SW face expedition led by Chris Bonington. Summit reached by 2 teams made up with Doug Scott, Dougal Haston, Peter Boardman, and Sirdar Pertemba. BBC cameraman Mick Burke failed to return from a solo summit bid.\n\n1978\n\nReinhold Messner (Italy, South Tyrol) and Peter Habeler (Austria) reach the summit without oxygen tanks.\n\n1979\n\nYugoslav West Ridge expedition, New route on West Ridge. Summit reached by two teams made up by Andrej Stremfelj and Nejc Zaplotnik (May 13th, 1979), and then two days later by Stipe Bozic, Stane Belak and Ang Phu. Stane Belak, Ang Phu and Stipe Bozic bivouac at 8300 meters. The next day, Ang Phu tragically fell on the way down and died.\n\n1980\n\nFirst winter ascent by a team from Poland (Leszek Cichy, Krzysztof Wielicki) on an expedition led by Andrzej Zawada.\n\nNew climbing path by a team from Poland (Andrzej Czok and Jerzy Kukuczka) by southern face.\n\nReinhold Messner (Italy, South Tyrol), first man to climb Everest alone and without oxygen tanks.\n\n1983\n\nLou Reichardt, Kim Momb, and Carlos Buhler become the first to summit the East Face.\n\n1984\n\nBachendri Pal summited Everest on May 23, 1984 via the standard south east ridge route. She was the first woman from India to summit Everest\n\n1988\n\nJean-Marc Boivin of France starts with a paraglider from the mountaintop.\n\n1989\n\nAnother Yugoslav expedition. South East Ridge. Stipe Bozic, Viki Groselj, Dimitar Ilijevski, and Sherpas Sonam and Agiva all reached the summit of the Everest. Dimitar Ilijevski failed to return.\n\n1990\n\nFirst Son of a summiter to Summit Everest: Peter Hillary\n\n1993\n\nNinety alpinists in the autumn alone, the commercial “Everest-climbing” starts.\n\nRamon Blanco of Spain became the oldest person to reach the summit aged 60 years, 160 days\n\n1995\n\nAlison Hargreaves becomes the first woman to climb Everest alone and without oxygen tanks.\n\nCaradog Jones became the first Welshman to reach the summit.\n\n1996: Disaster Year\n\nDuring the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people died trying to reach the summit, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history. That year, on May 10 a storm stranded several climbers between the summit and the safety of Camp IV, killing five on the south side (Rob Hall, Scott Fischer, Yasuko Namba, Doug Hansen and guide Andy Harris) and three Indian (Ladakhi) climbers on the north (Tsewang Paljor, Dorje Morup, Tsewang Smanla). Hall and Fischer were both highly experienced climbers who were leading paid expeditions to the summit. The disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of Everest.\n\nJournalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from Outside magazine, was also in Hall’s party, and afterwards published the bestseller Into Thin Air which related his experience. Anatoli Boukreev, a guide who felt impugned by Krakauer’s book, co-authored a rebuttal book called The Climb. The dispute sparked a large debate within the climbing community. In May 2004, Kent Moore, a physicist, and John L. Semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told New Scientist magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on that day suggested that freak weather caused oxygen levels to plunge by around 14%.[1][2]\n\nDuring the same season, climber and filmmaker David Breashears and his team filmed the IMAX feature Everest on the mountain (some climbing scenes were later recreated for the film in British Columbia, Canada). The 70 mm IMAX camera was specially modified to be lightweight enough to carry up the mountain, and to function in the extreme cold with the use of particular greases on the mechanical parts, plastic bearings and special batteries. Production was halted as Breashears and his team assisted the survivors of the May 10 disaster, but the team eventually reached the top on May 23 and filmed the first large format footage of the summit. On Breashears’ team was Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, following in his father’s footsteps for the first time. Also on his team was Ed Viesturs of Seattle, WA, who summited without the use of supplemental oxygen, and Araceli Seqarra, who became the first woman from Spain to summit Everest.\n\nThe storm’s impact on climbers on the mountain’s other side, the North Ridge, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book The Other Side of Everest.\n\nHans Kammerlander (Italy, South Tyrol) climbs the mountain from the north side in 16 hours and 45 minutes and returns on skis.\n\nGöran Kropp of Sweden becomes first person to ride his bicycle all the way from his home in Sweden to the mountain, scale it alone without the use of oxygen tanks, and bicycle all the way back.\n\n1998\n\nTom Whittaker is the first disabled climber to make it to the summit 1999\n\nSherpa Babu Chiri Sherpa of Nepal stays for 21 hours on the mountaintop.\n\nCathy O’Dowd becomes first woman to reach summit from northern and southern routes.\n\nMohammad Oraz became the first Iranian climber who conquest the Mount Everest.\n\n2000\n\nOn October 7 Davo Karničar from Slovenia accomplishes an uninterrupted ski descent from the top to the base camp in five hours.\n\n2001\n\nOn May 23 16 and 14 days year old Temba Tsheri Sherpa becomes the youngest person to summit Everest.\n\nOn May 24 22 year old Marco Siffredi of France made snowboarding history and Mt. Everest history by becoming the first person to ever descend Mt. Everest on a snowboard.\n\nOn May 25, 32 year old Erik Weihenmayer, of Boulder, Colorado, becomes the first blind person to reach the summit.\n\nOn the same day 64 year old Sherman Bull, of New Canaan, Connecticut, becomes the oldest person to reach the summit.\n\nAlso on the same day, 19 people made it to the summit, surpassing the previous record of 10 people. Everyone survived.\n\n2002\n\nPaul Giorgio climbed Mt. Everest again for the second time.\n\n2003 – 50th Anniversary\n\nDick Bass – the first person to climb the seven summits, and who first stood atop Everest in 1985 at 55 years old (making him the oldest person at that time to do so) returned in 2003 to attempt to reclaim his title. At 73 he would have reclaimed this honor, but he made it to ABC only. Dick’s team mates included the renowned American climbers Jim Wickwire and John Roskelley.\n\nOutdoor Life Network Expendition – OLN staged a high profile survivor style show where the winners got the chance to climb Everest.
