        "text": "After the successes of the Seven Summits project (May 2006), and the Three Poles Challenge (April 2009), Maxime Chaya, the Lebanese hero, is on ‘expedition mode’ again. This time, he is going for quite an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime adventure.\n\nThe voyage began near Perth – Western Australia. It crossed the Indian Ocean, and ended in Mauritius – off the east coast of Africa. Nothing but relentless open water with no land in sight for 6,500 km) Once the boat departed, it couldn’t turn back whatever the reason, as wind and current would prevent it from doing so.\n\nMaxime had chosen to lead a three-man team. His two teammates: Livar Nysted (Faroe Islands, Denmark aged 42) and Stuart Kershaw (UK, aged 33) have the necessary knowledge, skill, experience and will, for this crossing. Both have successfully rowed across the Atlantic and are eager to embark on this epic adventure.\n\nSuccess on this endeavor isn’t given. The number of people who have summited Everest is much greater than those who have rowed across an ocean, let alone the Indian Ocean. As a matter of fact, more humans have stood on the moon than boats been rowed across the Indian Ocean.\n\nFrom the high mountain to the high seas… ‘There is an Everest for Everyone’."
