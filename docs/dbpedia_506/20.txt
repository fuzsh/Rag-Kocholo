Maxime Edgard Chaya

Lebanon's foremost sportsman and climber, Maxime Chaya was the first person from his country to hoist its flag atop Everest, and he did so en route to ascending the highest mountain on every continent - the Seven Summits - while also skiing to the North and South Poles. Having experienced a multi-cultural education in Lebanon, France, Canada and Greece due to his homeland's civil war, Maxime went on to graduate with honors from the London School of Economics. He now regularly visits local schools and clubs to help motivate youngsters to "Climb Their Own Everest". He has been knighted twice for his achievements, and lives just north of his native Beirut, at sea level, with his wife Poupa and their children Edgard and Kelly.
