        "text": "There are millions of New Yorkers who do not speak English as their primary language and have limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. For these New Yorkers, their Limited English Proficient (LEP) status presents potential barriers to accessing important government programs and services.\n\nIn April 2022, Governor Hochul enacted New York State’s current language access policy as part of the FY 2023 Enacted Budget. This new law, which took effect on July 1, 2022, codified and expanded New York’s previous language access policy. Under the language access law, all State agencies that interact with the public must provide interpretation services in any language with respect to the provision of agency services or benefits, and must translate vital agency documents into the top 12 most commonly spoken non-English languages among LEP New Yorkers based on Census data.\n\nRead the Law\n\nUnder the new law, State agencies also have the option to offer up to four additional languages beyond the required 12 based on factors such as regional language access needs, the number of recently arrived immigrants who have limited English proficiency, feedback from community groups, and the populations of individuals with limited English proficiency most commonly served by different agencies. Any additional languages will be decided by each agency in consultation with the Office of Language Access, providing important flexibility in responding to specific language access needs across different agencies and throughout different areas of the state.\n\nWhat are the 12 most common non-English languages spoken in New York State?\n\nOver 5.7 million people living in New York report speaking a language other than English. Of these, 2.5 million report speaking English less than well. Based on the 2020 American Community Survey, the top 12 most common languages among Limited English Proficient New Yorkers are:\n\nSpanish\n\nChinese\n\nRussian\n\nYiddish\n\nBangla\n\nKorean\n\nHaitian Creole\n\nItalian\n\nArabic\n\nPolish\n\nFrench\n\nUrdu\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, Table B16001, 2020 5-year estimate. American Community Survey\n\nWhat is a Language Access Plan?\n\nA Language Access Plan sets forth the actions an agency will take to ensure meaningful access to their services for Limited English Proficient New Yorkers. This includes but is not limited to providing a list of translated documents and the languages in which those documents are available, identifying agency staff who have language access skills and abilities, preparing a training plan and annual monitoring plan, and describing outreach strategies. Agencies are required to update their Language Access Plans at least every two years.\n\nBelow are language access plans for all state agencies that provide direct services to the public. The plans are effective August 1, 2021. Agencies will update their plans on October 1, 2022, and again every two years after that.\n\nSearch Plans"
