        "text": "Dennis Baron\n\n\"No person shall be denied services, assistance, or facilities, directly or indirectly provided by the Government solely because that person communicates in English.\"\n\nfrom the 1996 Language of Government Act, passed by the House 8/1/96.\n\n___________\n\nFrom The Cincinnati Enquirer (19 July 1995, Metro B1): The Cincinnati City Council has received a recommendation from the Public Works Department (Committee of Names) that the city display informational signs on twelve area streets which had lost their earlier German names. English Street would thus receive a sign (12 by 18 inch) reading \"Formerly German Street, renamed April 9, 1918 because of the anti-German hysteria during WW I.\"\n\nThe streets named (with earlier name in parenthesis): Woodrow (Berlin) St, Republic (Bremen) St, Edgecliff Road (Brunswick Pl), Connecticut (Frankfort) Ave, Stonewall (Hamburg) St, Yukon (Hanover ) St, Merrimac (Hapsburg) St, Taft Road (Humboldt Av), Beredith Pl (Schumann St), Panama (Vienna) St, Orion Av (Wilhelm St).\n\nThe German American Citizens League had requested the names of a number of streets be changed back to their original ones.\n\n_____________\n\n1923: Washington Jay McCormick tries to make American the official language of the nation. McCormick hoped to \"supplement the political emancipation of â76 by the mental emancipation of â23,\" and he advised our writers to \"drop their top-coats, spats, and swagger-sticks, and assume occasionally their buckskin, moccasins, and tomahawks.\"\n\n1923: State Sen. Frank Ryan of Illinois proposes a bill to make American the official language of the state of Illinois. Its whereases attack those American Tories \"who have never become reconciled to our republican institutions and have ever clung to the tradition of King and Empire.\" According to Ryan, such Anglophiles foster racism and defeat the attempts of American patriots \"to weld the racial units into a solid American nation.\" The bill, supported by a coalition of Irish and Jewish Chicago politicians out to punish the British for their roles in Ireland and Palestine.\n\n1923: Meyer v. Nebraska (262 US 390). The Nebraska Supreme Court accepted the stateâs argument describing \"the baneful effects of permitting foreigners who had taken residence in this country, to rear and educate their children in the language of their native land.\" The Court ruled that such a situation, because it proved \"inimical\" to the public safety, inculcating in the children of immigrants \"ideas and sentiments foreign to the best interests of this country,\" fell within the police powers of the state.\n\nIt agreed as well that the teaching of a foreign language was harmful to the health of the young child: \"The hours which a child is able to devote to study in the confinement of school are limited. It must have ample time for exercise or play. Its daily capacity for learning is comparatively small.\" Such an argument was consistent with the educational theory of the day, which held as late as the 1950s that bilingualism led to confusion and academic failure, and was harmful to the psychological well-being of the child. Indeed, (According to Hakuta [1985, 27], the psychologist Florence Goodenough argued in 1926 that the use of a foreign language in the home was a leading cause of mental retardation.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out laws in Nebraska, Ohio, and Iowa forbidding foreign language instruction below the eighth grade on the grounds that such laws interfere with a language instructorâs calling, and with the right of parents to control the education of their children. The Court found a monolingual, English-speaking nation desirable, but rejected illegal means to promote this end. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, upholding the stateâs right to dictate curriculum and require English, dissented.\n\nThe Attorney General for the State of Nebraska argued, \"If it is within the police power of the state . . . to legislate respecting housing conditions in crowded cities, to prohibit dark rooms in tenement houses, to compel landlords to place windows in their tenements which will enable their tenants to enjoy the sunshine, it is within the police power of the state to compel every resident of Nebraska to so educate his children that the sunshine of American ideals will permeate the life of the future citizens of this republic. A father has no inalienable constitutional right to rear his children in physical, moral or intellectual gloom.\" [Brief and Argument of State of Nebraska, Defendant in Error, 14-15]\n\nIn his majority opinion, Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds (later to become known as a rabid opponent of the New Deal, argued, \"the protection of the Constitution extends to all,âto those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution,âa desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means.\"\n\n1965: Federal Voting Rights Act eliminates English-only qualification for voting.\n\n1969: English replaces American as the official language of the State of Illinois.\n\n1974: Lau v. Nichols (414 US 563); U.S. Supreme Court rules that LESA children (limited English speaking ability) were entitled to some sort of remedial instruction. The Lau decision mandates no specific remedy. Generally used to support bilingual education programs. In its opinion, the Court stated,\n\n\"Students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful instruction. . . . We know that those who do not understand English are certain to find their classroom experience wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful.\"\n\n1996: Language of Government Act passed by House, 8/1/96 declares English to be the language of the federal government.\n\nProvisions of the Language of Government Act:\n\n\"The official language of the Federal Government is English\"\n\nfederal officials \"shall have an affirmative obligation to preserve and enhance the role of English as the official language of the Federal Government\"\n\nRepresentatives of the Federal Government shall conduct its official business in English\n\nNo person shall be denied services, assistance, or facilities, directly or indirectly provided by the Federal Government solely because the person communicates in English.\n\nEvery person in the United States is entitled to communicate with representatives of the Federal Government in English; to receive information from or contribute information to the Federal Government in English; and to be informed of or be subject to official orders in English\n\nInjured persons may seek appropriate relief in civil court\n\nIt has been the long-standing national belief that full citizenship in the United States requires fluency in English\n\nAll authorized officials shall conduct all naturalization ceremonies entirely in English\n\nthis legislation shall supersede existing contravening federal law\n\nofficials may communicate orally in a language other than English while on official business\n\nthe act shall not limit the preservation or use of Native Alaskan or Native American languages\n\nExcluded from the Act: the teaching of languages; requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; actions required by national security; international relations, trade or commerce;\n\nactions protecting public health and safety\n\nactions of the Bureau of the Census\n\nactions protecting victims of crimes or criminal defendants\n\nusing terms of art or phrases from languages other than English\n\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 provisions for bilingual ballots is repealed\n\nThe majority report, after a nod to diversity, declares, \"throughout the history of the United States, the common thread binding individuals of differing backgrounds has been a common language. In order to preserve unity in diversity, and to prevent division along linguistic lines, the Federal Government should maintain a language common to all people.\" English will empower immigrants, and any money saved would go to teaching English to immigrants.\n\nThe law adds a chapter to Title 4 of the US Code entitled \"Language of the Federal Government.\" The bill was introduced by the late Bill Emerson (R-MO) in 1995; hearings were held before the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood Youth and Families Oct. 18 and Nov. 1, with only \"friendly\" witnesses testifying. Majority report of the Committee:\n\nOver the past few decades, Congressional action and inaction has resulted in a balkanized national language policy; publishing government documents in languages other than English discourages immigrants from learning English. Census Bureau reports over 320 different languages spoken in US.\n\nA GAO investigation, ordered by the Committee, found 265 of 400,000 federal documents published in foreign languages or .06%\n\nThe majority report continues, \"The point is not to quibble over facts and figures but rather to focus on the bigger policy: is America going to advocate policies like the learning of English to empower people to realize the American dream? Or, do we continue the trend toward the balkanization of languages, encouraging people to interact only with those of similar backgrounds?\n\n86% of citizens and 81% of immigrants want this bill. \"The vast majority of citizens in this country are fed up with the present day situation which has fostered linguistic welfare.\"\n\nas of 2006, 27 states now have official language laws\n\n79 NATIONS have official languages\n\nMap and table from the US English website\n\nMinority committee report:\n\nthe law would generate frivolous lawsuits, though Republicans have consistently opposed frivolous lawsuits;\n\nworried about impact on Puerto Rico\n\nAlaskan language specialist: \"The common thread has not been a common language but rather to âpromote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity. . . . Division along linguistic lines has only been created historically by Federal Government policy\"\n\nBilingual voting requirements repeal act of 1996: Opposed by Justice Department: \"More than our language unites us. We are united as Americans by the principles of tolerance, free speech, representative democracy, and equality under the law. HR 351 contravenes each of these principles.\" Supporters of repeal claim it is wasteful; defenders of bilingual provisions of the voting rights law demonstrate it is low cost and efficient; its repeal will not increase use of English.\n\nAction taken: passed by House Judiciary Committee (ayes include Mr. Bono, as well as Henry Hyde; testifying in favor of repeal was Ron Rotunda, of the U of I Law School)\n\nIn its 1996-97 term, the U. S. Supreme Court will consider Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona (SC no. 95-974).\n\n_______________\n\nDennis Baron is professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
