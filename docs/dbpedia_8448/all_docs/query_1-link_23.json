        "text": "üéâ Welcome to the Digital.gov style guide!\n\nBelow you‚Äôll find guidance for voice and tone, author bios and photos, branding, grammar, images, plain language, inclusive language, and more. We will soon update details on how to submit to Digital.gov.\n\nVoice and tone\n\nArticles for Digital.gov‚Äîwritten by employees from across the federal government‚Äîuse an informal, conversational tone.\n\nConscious inclusivity\n\nNot everyone who uses government services or engages with federal agencies are U.S. citizens. When appropriate, use phrases or words such as: the public, users, people, or folks.\n\nAdditionally, where possible:\n\nAvoid using gendered pronouns; instead, use they or their.\n\nAvoid age-related descriptions of people unless absolutely necessary for the content; in those cases, try using older people or older person ‚Äî instead of elderly or senior.\n\nSee the 18F Content Guide for more on inclusive language: https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/.\n\nGrammar and spelling\n\nIn general, we follow AP Style. Use plain language in your writing for clarity. Avoid using acronyms or jargon that may be unfamiliar to the general public or those outside your agency.\n\nCapitalization\n\nCapitalize proper nouns for people, places, and agency names.\n\nDo not capitalize words like federal, government, or agency unless it is:\n\nThe first word in a sentence.\n\nAn official title for or name of something (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)).\n\nContent titles and headers\n\nFormat\n\nDecember 2022: We are switching from title case to sentence case for all titles and paragraph headers.\n\nHeadlines are key to a story. They have to stand on their own in conveying the story, and must include key context. They should tempt readers to want to read more, without misleading or overpromising. A concise, well-worded headline will tempt readers to want to learn more. Try to keep titles to under 64 characters.\n\nThink carefully about keywords, search engine optimization (SEO), and social media optimization. Which terms are users likely to be searching for? What will be easily recognizable and compelling in your headline? Include keywords that are central to the story‚Äôs content, and consider what keywords relevant to the story are trending in search engines and social media.\n\nUse numerals; do not spell out numbers except in casual uses or formal names: use hundreds instead of 100s; Big Ten; or one of the first. Also use numerals for ordinals, such as: 2nd, 9th, etc.\n\nCapitalize only the first word and proper nouns in headlines. If the title contains a colon, the first word after a colon is always uppercase in headlines.\n\nOnly use end punctuation for headers that ask a question (e.g., What Did We Learn?).\n\nA few examples:\n\nTitle case: 18F Checks in With Jerome Lee and the eAPD Project\n\nNew sentence case: 18F checks in with Jerome Lee and the eAPD project\n\nTitle case: How Effective Is Your Communication?\n\nNew sentence case: How effective is your communication?\n\nTitle case: User Experience (UX) vs Customer Experience (CX): What‚Äôs the Dif?\n\nNew sentence case: User experience (UX) vs customer experience (CX): What‚Äôs the dif?\n\nIf you‚Äôre unsure, many free, web-based title case tools use filters to set AP Style and title case (Examples: capitalizemytitle.com and titlecase.com).\n\nSize\n\nArticle titles should be set to H1, with any subsequent headers set as H2, H3, and so forth, in hierarchical order.\n\nDo not use H3 or below to attempt to make the text appear bold; just apply bold formatting to the text with the Formatting Toolbar in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.\n\nPublication titles\n\nBlogs, magazines, books, etc. are in normal text (i.e., no italics or underlining). Ideally, the titles will be linked to the work that is being referenced.\n\nCourtesy and professional titles\n\nOn first reference, introduce people by their first and last names without a courtesy title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Sir, Madam, Dr.).\n\nIf a person‚Äôs gender isn‚Äôt clear from their first name (e.g., Chris, Pat, Lesley, Jean), make this clear by referring to them by the appropriate pronoun after the first reference.\n\nNumbers\n\nWrite out all numbers under 10.\n\nUse numbers with the percent symbol (e.g.; 0.9%, 7%, 23%), but use words instead of figures in casual use (She said he has a zero percent chance of winning.).\n\nSymbols\n\nUse a forward slash / between words can be ambiguous; do not use one to replace words like and or or.\n\nUnless a symbol is part of a name or branding, use the word (e.g., use the word and instead of an ampersand & or a plus sign +).\n\nUse the expanded form of Month Day, Year (e.g., February 16, 2022) to avoid confusion that may arise by using the numeric format; for users in some other countries, 01/11/2018 would mean November 1st; not January 11th.\n\nFor specific dates, use the full, four-digit year\n\nCan abbreviate for informal dates (the ‚Äò90s)\n\nInclude ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, th) on dates (e.g., use November 23rd instead of November 23)\n\nTime\n\nTime descriptors ‚Äúante meridiem‚Äù (before noon) and ‚Äúpost meridiem‚Äù (after noon) should be abbreviated with lowercase letters as am and pm, respectively.\n\nUse the 12-hour clock (8:00 am, 4:00 pm)\n\nAvoid redundancies, such as, ‚Äú10 am this morning‚Äù\n\nSeasons (winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn) are not capitalized\n\nPlaces\n\nWhen referring to a number of states, the word ‚Äústate‚Äù should be lowercase (e.g., All 50 states responded.)\n\nLocations\n\nDistrict of Columbia: abbreviate as D.C. in copy, but use the official postal code, DC (without periods), for an address\n\nUnited States: abbreviate as U.S.\n\nIn copy, spell out state names, such as California. This will help keep naming conventions consistent (while the 2-character abbreviation without periods is the current postal standard for addresses in U.S. states and territories, older versions are still used by some people), and it can help avoid confusion; people often mix up the abbreviation for Louisiana (LA) with the one for Los Angeles (L.A.)\n\nAgency abbreviations\n\nInitialisms and acronyms\n\nTo avoid confusion, always provide the full name of an agency or program the first time you mention it, followed by its abbreviation (as an initialism or acronym) within parentheses. You can then use just the abbreviation elsewhere in the copy. Example:\n\nLorem ipsum National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n\nDuis aute irure dolor NASA in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\n\nInitialism examples:\n\nAn initialism is an acronym where you pronounce each letter.\n\nOMG ‚Äî Oh, my God (or gosh)\n\nLOL ‚Äî laughing out loud\n\nBIA ‚Äî Bureau of Indian Affairs\n\nGSA ‚Äî U.S. General Services Administration\n\nTTS ‚Äî Technology Transformation Services\n\nFBI ‚Äî Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\nCDC ‚Äî Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nOPM ‚Äî U.S. Office of Personnel Management\n\nSEO ‚Äî search engine optimization\n\nCMS ‚Äî content management system, call management system, or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS))\n\nHTML ‚Äî HyperText Markup Language\n\nCSS ‚Äî Cascading Style Sheets\n\nAcronym examples:\n\nAn acronym is an initialism that is used as a word.\n\nscuba ‚Äî Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus\n\nlaser ‚Äî Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\n\nradar ‚Äî Radio Detection and Ranging\n\nWYSIWYG (pronounced: Whizzy-wig) ‚Äî What You See Is What You Get\n\nWCAG (pronounced: way-cag or wuh-cag) ‚Äî Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\n\nNIOSH (pronouned: nigh-osh) ‚Äî National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\n\nNASA ‚Äî National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOPEC (pronounced: oh-peck) ‚Äî Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\n\nNARA ‚Äî National Archives and Records Administration\n\nDARPA ‚Äî Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\n\nNATO (pronounced: nay-toe) ‚Äî North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nFEMA ‚Äî Federal Emergency Management Agency\n\nSWAT ‚Äî special weapons and tactics\n\nNote: Avoid redundancies, such as, ‚ÄúATM machine‚Äù (automated teller machine machine) and ‚ÄúPIN number‚Äù (personal identification number number).\n\nPluralization\n\nThere is no need to add an s to the end of an initialism or acronym if a word in the original name is already plural.\n\nFor example, we use CoE for both Center of Excellence and Centers of Excellence. Adding an s on the end ‚Äî CoEs ‚Äî would be, Center of Excellences.\n\nPunctuation\n\nCommas\n\nIn writing, oral pauses are indicated by commas. They are also used to order things, like lists, clauses, or a series of terms. Much like debates over what counts as a sandwich and the proper pronunciation for the image file type, gif, disagreements about whether or not to use an Oxford comma (also known as the Harvard comma and the serial comma) are quite common.\n\nIt can be confusing (or potentially costly in unexpected ways) to omit the Oxford comma, so, we‚Äôd like to err on the side of caution. As noted by AP Stylebook in their Twitter Chat on September 12, 2017:\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt ban Oxford commas! We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut: If a comma doesn‚Äôt help make clear what is being said, don‚Äôt use it. ‚ÄúThe flag is red, white and blue‚Äù is clear.‚Äù\n\nSo, use your best judgement. If anything is unclear, we‚Äôll help you clarify.\n\nColons\n\nAfter a colon, capitalize the next word if it starts a complete sentence (i.e., is not a fragment).\n\nApostrophe abuse\n\nUse an apostrophe to indicate:\n\nPossession ‚Äî ‚ÄúAgile also improves the development team‚Äôs ability to commit to work.‚Äù\n\nMissing letters or numbers\n\nContractions: ‚ÄúFor example, with a bilingual English and Spanish website, we would‚Äôve clearly labeled captions (for English text) and subtitles (for Spanish text).‚Äù\n\nDate abbreviations: ‚Äúthe ‚Äò90s‚Äù (the apostrophe replaces the 19 in 1990s)\n\nDo not use an apostrophe to make words plural. Ever. Ev. Er. üòâ\n\nEm dash\n\nYou can easily offset a phrase within a sentence with the long em dash ‚Äî instead of using parentheses, commas, colons, etc. (see link for examples).\n\nBulleted and numbered lists\n\nIf it‚Äôs a complete sentence, use punctuation (usually a period) at the end of the list; not after every bullet point.\n\nIf it‚Äôs a list of fragments, do not use punctuation at the end. Capitalize the first word in each bullet point.\n\ni.e., vs. e.g.,\n\nThese two terms are not interchangeable; each has its own meaning and usage.\n\nThe abbreviation ‚Äúi.e.‚Äù stands for the Latin phrase, id est, which means ‚Äúthat is‚Äù or ‚Äúin other words.‚Äù\n\nSince 1977, Star Wars, which belongs to a sub-genre of science fiction (i.e., the space opera or science fantasy), has released nine main live-action films in the Skywalker Saga, and three spin-off films; two live-action, and one computer-animated film.\n\nThe abbreviation ‚Äúe.g.‚Äù stands for the Latin phrase exempli gratia, which means ‚Äúfor example‚Äù ‚Äî use it to list one or more examples.\n\nSince 1966, Star Trek has been an example of diversity, equity, and inclusion (e.g., lead characters who are: women and people of color, people with disabilities, and folks in the LGBTQIA+ community). Each of its 13 TV series and 13 films represent the creator‚Äôs vision for a society with ‚Äúinfinite diversity in infinite combinations‚Äù (IDIC).\n\nversus\n\nSpell the word out in regular writing, and when quoting someone:\n\n‚ÄúThe proposal to revamp Medicare versus proposals to reform Medicare and Medicaid at the same time is ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nIn short expressions, however, use of the abbreviation vs. is permitted:\n\nThe comparison of Star Trek vs. Star Wars has long been an issue with fans of the sci-fi genre.\n\nFor court cases, use v.:\n\nHaaland v. Brackeen\n\nDigital.gov branding\n\nThe overarching name of the site is Digital.gov. You may see references to ‚ÄúDigitalGov‚Äù in our archives, but it should be referred to as ‚ÄúDigital.gov‚Äù going forward.\n\nLogos\n\nBranded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs:\n\nDigital Analytics Program (DAP)\n\ndap‚Äôs dashboard website domain and name are the same: analytics.usa.gov\n\nDigitalGov Search was renamed: Search.gov\n\nDigital.gov University (DGU)\n\nU.S. Digital Registry (no acronym; replaced the Federal Social Media Registry and the Federal Mobile Products Registry)\n\nU.S. Web Design Standards was renamed: U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)\n\nAdditionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have over 20 communities listed on Digital.gov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they don‚Äôt always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on Digital.gov.\n\nName examples include: MobileGov (mobile site, apps, devices), SocialGov (Social Media), OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).\n\nImage use\n\nWe must have permission or license to use any image posted on Digital.gov. Please do not send copyrighted images such as cartoon characters, or stills from movies or TV shows.\n\nImage File Types:\n\n.png (preferred)\n\n.jpg\n\n.gif (only if animated)\n\nImage dimensions:\n\nPlease always send us the original image, as large as possible. Our content management system (CMS) will optimize and resize photos as necessary.\n\nThe images seen when a page is shared on social media platforms (featured image) must be sent to us in landscape orientation (a rectangle that is more wide than tall). Currently, the dimensions for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. must be sized at 1200 x 628 pixels (width by height).\n\nImages of people can be sent as square images or in portrait orientation (a rectangle that is more tall than wide). A width of at least 600 pixels is preferred.\n\nAccessibility\n\nAll images require alt text for screen readers, and/or a caption that appears below the photo. Be descriptive, yet succinct. Take care to note if the image is an infographic, factoid, diagram, chart, photo, or logo. If related to a program, agency, or event, include the name and/or acronym (and if an event, please include the date).\n\nPlease do not use images of text; we can highlight text in call-out box, an accordion (e.g., event transcripts or policy memos), a quote box, or other styles.\n\nAttribution\n\nAll stock images require source information. Below are some examples of requirements based on source:\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images Content License Agreement: https://www.gettyimages.com/eula ‚Äî Section 6 has intellectual property rights and how to properly format attribution for an image.\n\nExample:\n\n10 Hiring Tips for Attracting Underrepresented Digital Services Talent to Serve\n\n10 Tips to Create, Maintain, and Present Non-English Digital Content: A Q&A with Michael Mul√©\n\niStock.com photos (formerly Thinkstock)\n\niStock Content License Agreement: https://www.istockphoto.com/legal/license-agreement ‚Äî Section 3 covers restricted uses, and Section 7 has intellectual property rights and how to properly format attribution for an image.\n\nUsing iStock files: https://www.istockphoto.com/faq/using-files\n\nFrequently Asked Questions: https://www.istockphoto.com/faq\n\nCreative Commons (CC)\n\nBest Practices for Attribution (with examples): http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution\n\nExamples on Digital.gov:\n\nSocial Media: Accessibility Issues and Solutions\n\nCelebrating Black History at TTS: Reflections on the Challenges of the Past and Present\n\nflickr photos\n\nMany Flickr users have chosen to offer their work under a Creative Commons license. https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/\n\nDigital.gov example\n\nGive attribution to photographers with CC license https://help.yahoo.com/kb/flickr/SLN7674.html\n\nDefinitions and general guidelines are available on Creative Commons website.
