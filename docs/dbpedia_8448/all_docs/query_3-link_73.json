        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. –Congressman Bob Good (VA-5) introduced the English Language Unity Act to establish English as the official language of the United States government.\n\n\"In the melting pot of the United States of America, our common English language promotes unity and fosters cultural integration,\" said Congressman Bob Good. \"The English Language Unity Act is a common-sense measure that will strengthen America by establishing English as our official language, encouraging its use throughout the country, and cutting total federal spending.It is also in the best interests of our legal immigrants, as proficiency in English helps them assimilate into our culture, succeed in the workplace, and reach their greatest potential.”\n\n“ProEnglish is excited that Rep. Bob Good is the sponsor of The English Language Unity Act in the 118th Congress. His belief in our country is well known. We appreciate the Congressman’s commitment to cutting unnecessary government expense and at the same time his desire to encourage all of our citizens to be assimilated into our great country. We believe the promotion of English as the language of record for all government business is sound government at its best.” —ProEnglish\n\nThe United States is one of the few countries without an official language. The English Language Unity Act would require all official functions of the U.S. government, including official documents, ceremonies, and proceedings, to be conducted in English. The bill also encourages the voluntary use of English by individuals and organizations across the country. In 2017, the U.S. Federal Government Spent $517 million on Translation and Interpreting Services.\n\nRead more exclusively on Fox Digital."
