        "text": "Plain language is grammatically correct and universally understood language that includes complete sentence structure and accurate word usage. Plain language is not unprofessional writing or a method of \"dumbing down\" or \"talking down\" to the reader.\n\nWriting that is clear and to the point helps improve all communication as it takes less time to read and comprehend. Clear writing tells the reader exactly what the reader needs to know without using unnecessary words or expressions. Communicating clearly is its own reward as it saves time and money. It also improves reader response to messages. Using plain language avoids creating barriers that set us apart from the people with whom we are communicating.\n\nWe at OPM fully support the Plain Language initiative, which has its origins in a Federal directive that requires agencies to incorporate plain language elements in the development of communications materials for the public. We are committed to the use of plain language in all new documents written for the public, other government entities, and fellow workers.\n\nAfter all, OPM's mission is to recruit, retain, and honor a world-class workforce. Prospective, current, and former employees – as well as their families and other stakeholders, many of whom also receive benefits through OPM – deserve to receive clear and consistent information from us. Further, the American people deserve a better window into what their government does.\n\nPlain Language Act\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the Plain Writing Act of 2010 (H.R. 946/Public Law 111-274) on October 13, 2010. The Act is designed \"to improve the effectiveness and accountability of Federal agencies to the public by promoting clear Government communication that the public can understand and use.\"\n\nTips for Using Plain Language\n\nCertain qualities characterize plain language. These include common, everyday words, except for necessary technical terms. Other qualities include the use of personal pronouns; the active voice; logical organization; and easy-to-read and understandable design features, such as bullets and tables.\n\n1. Engage Your Readers.\n\nFirst, consider who your readers are.\n\nConsider what your readers need to know and want to know. Organize content to answer their questions.\n\nWrite at a reading level that is appropriate to your intended audience.\n\n2. Write Clearly.\n\nUse common, everyday words whenever possible.\n\nWord Choices:\n\nUse common, everyday words but avoid slang.\n\nUse personal pronouns such as \"you.\"\n\nUse \"must\" instead of \"shall.\"\n\nAvoid using undefined technical terms.\n\nUse positive rather than negative words.\n\nAvoid using gender-specific terminology.\n\nAvoid long strings of nouns.\n\nVerb Forms:\n\nUse active voice.\n\nUse action verbs.\n\nUse the present tense whenever you can.\n\nStructure:\n\nUse parallel construction.\n\nBe direct.\n\nAvoid unnecessary exceptions.\n\n3. Display Material Correctly\n\nAppearance is an important aspect of clear communication. If a document is pleasing to the eye, it will be more likely to attract your readers' attention. Appearance can also be an aid to readers, improving comprehension and retention.\n\nOrganization. Strong, logical organization includes an introduction followed by short sentences and paragraphs. Organize messages to respond to your readers' interests and concerns.\n\nIntroduction. In lengthier documents, use an introduction and a table of contents to help readers understand how a document is organized.\n\nShort Sentences and Paragraphs. Sentence length should average 15-20 words. Sentences that are simple, active, affirmative, and declarative hold readers' interest. Generally, each paragraph should contain only one topic. You may wish to use a series of paragraphs if you need to express complex or highly technical information. The more writing deviates from a clear and to-the-point structure, the harder it will be for readers to understand what you are trying to convey.\n\nLayout. Layout includes margins, headings, and white space. Provide white space between sections to break up text and to make it easier for readers to understand. Use headings to guide readers; the question-and-answer format is especially helpful. Try to anticipate your readers' questions and pose them as a reader would. Use adequate margins.\n\nTables. Tables make complex information readily understandable. They can help readers see relationships more easily, and they may require fewer words than straight text.\n\nTypography. Typography relates to fonts and typographical elements used for emphasis, such as bullets or italics. Limit the number of fonts you use. It is usually best to stick to one font for headings and another for text. Use typographical elements consistently throughout your document – and avoid overusing any one element.\n\n4. Evaluate Your Document.\n\nTo ensure that you are communicating clearly, evaluate the document or, better yet, have another person read it and offer suggestions for clarification. Look over the document for:\n\nWord choice, verb forms, and structure;\n\nCorrect spelling, grammar, and punctuation;\n\nInclusion of appropriate devices, such as dating, page numbering, and consistency;\n\nVisual appeal;\n\nConsistency and effectiveness of layout and typographical devices; and\n\nLine breaks that inadvertently separate part of a name or date in a way that reduces clarity.\n\nWhere Can I Learn More?\n\nOpenOPM. Visit our Open Government blog to learn more about what OPM is doing to promote plain language. You can also leave us a comment there.\n\nPlain Language Action and Information Network. PLAIN is an organization of federal employees that promotes plain language.\n\nTraining offered by the National Institutes of Health. This basic training is free. It uses engaging stories from the history of health and medicine but is not just for medical professionals.
