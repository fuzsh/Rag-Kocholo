        "text": "First, create and complete your profile to apply for any job on USAJOBS.\n\nWith a USAJOBS profile, you can save jobs, automate job searches, and manage everything you need to complete your application, including resumes and required documents.\n\nOnce you create your profile, you can search for jobs.\n\nIt's best to sign into your profile before searching. Why? We can use your information to improve your job search results.\n\nYou can also use filters such as location, salary, work schedule or agency to narrow your results.\n\nIf you find a job you're interested in, read the entire announcement to determine if you're eligible and meet the qualifications. It's important to read the announcement because there are required qualifications you must meet and include in your application.\n\nRead the How to Apply section of the job announcement before starting your application. Click Apply, and we'll walk you through a five-step process where you'll attach a resume and any required documents.\n\nDuring the application process, you can review, edit and delete your information. We'll automatically save your progress as you go so that you won't lose any changes.\n\nWhen your application is ready, you'll be directed from USAJOBS to the hiring agency's system to submit your application. Before you submit, you may need to complete other agency-required steps such as a questionnaire or uploading additional documents.\n\nThe time it takes to submit depends on the job you are applying for and the hiring agency's requirements.\n\nYou can check your application using the Track This Application link in your USAJOBS profile or contact the hiring agency listed on the job announcement.\n\nThe hiring agency begins reviewing applications when the job announcement closes. The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you're eligible and meet the qualifications for the position.\n\nThe hiring agency will place applicants into quality categories. Those placed in the highest category are sent to the hiring official.\n\nThe hiring official will review the highest qualified applications and select applicants to interview based on agency policy. The hiring agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews.\n\nYou may be interviewed by a panel, in-person, video or phone interview, and there may be more than one interview round. For example, an applicant may have a phone interview and then an in-person interview.\n\nScheduling an interview may take some time, depending on the number of applicants to interview.\n\nAfter all interviews are completed, the agency will select a candidate(s) and contact them to start the job offer process.\n\nFor those not selected, the hiring agency will update the job's status to Hiring Complete."
