        "text": "Government Services\n\nAs the exclusive licensee of ACTFL Assessments, LTI has delivered language proficiency tests to both state and federal government agencies since 1998. ACTFL and LTI provide language proficiency expertise to members of the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) - a group of more than thirty federal agencies involved in language training and testing. ACTFL assessments have been shown to be an effective, reliable, and defensible way to assess the abilities of linguists called on to serve the government. Account setup is quick and easy, with no minimums to meet.\n\nTo set up an account, or to ask any questions, please contact us at customercare@languagetesting.com or call 1-800-486-8444.\n\nFederal Government Language Proficiency Testing\n\nThe United States government uses a variety of language tests to measure employee and candidate language proficiency in terms of the 4 communication skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Test scores are reported according to the ACTFL Proficiency Scale or ILR Scale and are commonly accepted by government agencies, academic institutions, and major corporations worldwide.\n\nLanguage Proficiency Scales\n\nProficiency-based language tests measure language users’ ability to communicate effectively according to one of the language proficiency scales: the ACTFL, ILR, or CEFR scales. While traditional language achievement tests are tied to a specific curriculum or sequence of grammar and vocabulary, proficiency-based tests like ACTFL’s assessments take a more holistic approach in that the method of language acquisition does not inform test results. Proficiency-based language tests evaluate the candidate’s ability to communicate in a variety of contexts according to a proficiency scale such as the ILR and ACTFL Proficiency Scales described below.\n\nILR\n\nThe Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) has provided the US government with language standards since 1955. Tests using their scale are widely used by government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels.\n\nTheir scale encompasses six levels as well as their corresponding plus qualifications:\n\n0, or No Proficiency\n\n0+, or Memorized Proficiency\n\n1, or Elementary Proficiency\n\n1+, or Elementary Proficiency, Plus\n\n2, or Limited Working Proficiency\n\n2+, or Limited Working Proficiency, Plus\n\n3, or Professional Working Proficiency\n\n3+, or Professional Working Proficiency, Plus\n\n4, or Full Professional Proficiency\n\n4, or Full Professional Proficiency, Plus\n\n5, or Native or Bilingual Fluency\n\nACTFL\n\nUnlike the numeric ILR scale, the ACTFL scale is based on a range of major levels and sublevels that can be conceptualized as an inverted pyramid with Novice at the bottom and Distinguished at the top. The first three levels — Novice, Intermediate and Advanced — are separated into Low, Medium, and High sublevels.\n\nThe ACTFL Proficiency Scale ranges from Novice to Distinguished:\n\nNovice\n\nIntermediate\n\nAdvanced\n\nSuperior\n\nDistinguished\n\nACTFL assessments provide certification of language skills in the Novice to Superior range on the ACTFL Scale.\n\nGovernment Clients\n\nLTI serves multiple government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Department of State, and the Defense Intelligence Agency for their language testing needs.
