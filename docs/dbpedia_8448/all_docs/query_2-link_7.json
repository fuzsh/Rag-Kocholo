Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Language Access Plan (LAP or Plan) is to ensure that DOJ components and staff take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to DOJ benefits, services, information, and other important aspects of the Department’s programs and activities for individuals with LEP.\n\n3. Authority\n\nPursuant to Executive Order No. 13166, each federal agency is required to “examine the services it provides and develop and implement a system by which LEP persons can meaningfully access those services consistent with, and without unduly burdening, the fundamental mission of the agency.” Federal agencies shall also “prepare a plan to improve access to its federally conducted programs and activities … includ[ing] the steps the agency will take to ensure that eligible LEP persons can meaningfully access the agency’s program and activities.”\n\nFor agencies that provide federal financial assistance, Executive Order No. 13166 requires those agencies to work to ensure that recipients of federal financial assistance provide meaningful access to their applicants and beneficiaries with LEP. The latter provision is in accordance with the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of national origin. This Language Access Plan not only ensures the implementation of these language access legal requirements with respect to the Department’s programs and activities, but also provides additional general language access guidance and best practices for components in an effort to strengthen DOJ internal policies on the provision of language access.\n\nThis Plan establishes guidelines and standards in accordance with:\n\nStatutes:\n\nSection 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d) (Title VI).[11]\n\nSections 501, 504, and 508[12] of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n\nExecutive Orders:\n\nExecutive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. Reg. 159, 50121 (Aug. 16, 2000).[13]\n\nExecutive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, 86 Fed. Reg. 14, 7009 (Jan. 20, 2021).[14]\n\nExecutive Order 14031, Advancing Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, 86 Fed. Reg. 105, 29675 (June 3, 2021).[15]\n\nExecutive Order 14091, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, 88 Fed. Reg. 35, 10825 (Feb. 16, 2023).[16]\n\nDOJ Attorney General Directives and Policies:\n\nUnited States Attorney General’s Memorandum to Heads of Department Components Regarding Language Access Obligations Under Executive Order 13166 (June 28, 2010).[17]\n\nUnited States Attorney General’s Memorandum to Heads of Federal Agencies, General Counsels, and Civil Rights Heads Regarding Federal Government’s Renewed Commitment to Language Access Obligations Under Executive Order 13166 (Feb. 17, 2011).[18]\n\nUnited States Attorney General’s Memorandum for Department of Justice Employees on Improving the Department’s Efforts to Combat Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents (May 27, 2021).[19]\n\nUnited States Attorney General’s Memorandum for Heads of Federal Agencies, Heads of Civil Rights Offices and General Counsels Regarding Strengthening the Federal Government’s Commitment to Language Access (Nov. 21, 2022).[20]\n\nDepartment of Justice Strategic Plan (2022).[21]\n\nDepartment of Justice Equity Action Plan (2022).[22]\n\nOther Relevant DOJ Guidance:\n\nThese guidelines are designed to ensure greater consistency between federal agency implementation of EO 13166 and the application of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to recipients of federal funds, such as those described in:\n\nDOJ’s initial LEP Guidance, Enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — National Origin Discrimination Against Persons with Limited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. Reg. 50, 123 (Aug. 16, 2000).[23]\n\nDOJ’s later LEP Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons, 67 Fed. Reg. 41,455 (June 18, 2002).[24]\n\n4. Scope of Policy\n\nThis plan sets forth guidance for DOJ components and staff about what should be included in each component-specific LAP to ensure that DOJ-wide language access policies, standards, and procedures are implemented consistently across all federally conducted and federally assisted programs and activities administered or funded by DOJ.[25] This document will serve as the primary language access policy for components that have elected not to prepare a component-specific LAP.\n\nThe guidance included in this plan is intended to improve the internal management of the Department’s language access program, and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers or employees, or any person. Because this document is intended for the internal management of the Department’s language access program, it is not intended to be cited in any judicial or administrative proceeding. Administration of the programs discussed herein is within the sole discretion of the Department and its components.\n\n5. Definitions\n\nKey terms used in this plan are defined in Appendix A.\n\n6. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThis plan is carried out by the Department’s Language Access Coordinator, Language Access Working Group (DOJ LAWG), components, and component staff. Their corresponding roles and responsibilities are described in Appendix B.\n\n7. Mechanism to Receive Feedback or Complaints\n\nAny comments, feedback, questions, or complaints regarding this Language Access Plan may be directed to atj_languageaccess@usdoj.gov.\n\n8. Language Access Plan Review and Update\n\nComponents should draft or update their component-specific language access plans consistent with this DOJ LAP and submit to the DOJ LAC within 180 days after the issuance of this LAP and any significant updates to this LAP thereafter. Each component should maintain its component-specific language access plan on its webpage.\n\nThis LAP, as well as component-specific LAPs, must be updated at least once every five years in consultation with the DOJ Language Access Coordinator, DOJ LAWG, the Civil Rights Division, and stakeholders as appropriate.\n\nGuidelines for Language Access Planning and Operationalization\n\nEvery day, contact between the Department and the public may involve persons with LEP and/or individuals who are D/HOH. For example, Department staff interview witnesses, victims, and defendants in civil, criminal, and administrative cases and investigations; communicate with inmates who seek to access prison grievance procedures, counseling, health services, religious and other accommodations, and educational programming; hold immigration hearings and other immigration proceedings, and generate correspondence related to these activities; maintain hotlines and establish complaint procedures for members of the public; host web pages containing important information; transport prisoners between facilities and courts; communicate with debtors, including to ensure they understand information on bankruptcy, and to assist in credit counseling and debtor education processes; and conduct outreach and produce documents related to crime victims’ rights, trafficking in persons, police misconduct, predatory telemarketing, and a host of other important mission-related actions.\n\nMindful of the component’s mission, operations, and level of interaction with the public, components shall consider the needs of individuals with LEP and/or individuals who are D/HOH early in the process of designing programs, services, and activities. Components with significant public interaction are required to prepare a component-specific language access plan.\n\nThe following thirteen topics are essential elements of language access program planning. Each topic should be addressed in component-specific language access plans in light of each component’s nature and operations. Any component that has opted not to prepare a component-specific language access plan shall adopt the policies and principles discussed below.\n\nIdentification of Communities with LEP and/or who are D/HOH and their Interaction with DOJ\n\nIdentification of Individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH and their Primary Language or Method of Communication\n\nQuality Assurance and Control\n\nOutreach and Engagement with Communities with LEP and/or who are D/HOH\n\nProcurement\n\nAllocation of Resources\n\nNotification of the Availability of Language Assistance Services\n\nProvision of Language Assistance Services\n\nMultilingual and Accessible Digital Content\n\nStaff Training\n\nHiring Practices and Access to Multilingual Staff\n\nDepartmental and Interagency Cooperation\n\nPerformance Measurement and Evaluation\n\n1. Identification of Communities with LEP and/or who are D/HOH and their Interaction with DOJ\n\nTo plan for and effectively provide meaningful language access to individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH, components should identify the top languages[26] used by the communities they serve or may serve and determine the most common means through which communities with LEP and/or who are D/HOH interact with the component.\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey (ACS), an estimated 3.6% of the U.S. population are D/HOH. Accurate data regarding communities that are D/HOH is limited due to definitional inconsistencies across federal and state agencies, limited reliable sources that collect this data, and persistent under-reporting.[27]\n\nFurthermore, according to the ACS, the top five languages spoken in the United States by individuals with LEP are Spanish, Chinese (including the spoken languages of Mandarin and Cantonese and the written languages of Simplified and Traditional Chinese), Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog (including Filipino).[28] Component staff should identify the top languages spoken by individuals with LEP based on their program objectives, constituency, and/or geographic region, using any or all of the following tools and resources:\n\nLanguage Maps and Data on Communities with LEP\n\nLEP.gov/Maps[29] is a DOJ-maintained website with national, state, and judicial district maps of the U.S. population with LEP by number and concentration. However, Census language categories used in those maps are limited and do not include disaggregated data or information on individuals with LEP who may speak languages of lesser diffusion, select American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other Indigenous languages, and/or language variants.\n\nData from other federal, state, and local government agencies, schools, communities, and faith-based organizations can also be helpful to supplement Census data or obtain more granular details on the languages used by a specific community or region, including intersectional or disaggregated data.\n\nConsultation with community members with LEP and/or who are D/HOH, and organizations that serve those individuals as described in section 4 below.\n\nDOJ Language Self-Assessment Tool,[30] which can assist components in identifying the different points of interaction with individuals with LEP, historic usage of programs and services by individuals with LEP, and effective service delivery strategies.\n\nComponents may seek support from the DOJ Justice Management Division, the DOJ Language Access Coordinator, the Civil Rights Division, and the Office for Access to Justice (ATJ), for assistance in identifying communities with LEP.\n\n2. Identification of Individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH and their Primary Language or Method of Communication\n\nComponent staff should, at the point of first contact with an individual with LEP and/or who is D/HOH, make reasonable efforts to conduct or arrange for an initial assessment of the need for language assistance services.\n\nComponent staff can determine whether a person needs language assistance in several ways:\n\nVoluntary self-identification by the individual or their companion.\n\nAffirmative inquiry regarding the primary language of the individual if they have self-identified as needing language assistance services.\n\nEngagement by a qualified multilingual staff or qualified interpreter to verify an individual’s primary language.\n\nUse of an “I Speak” language identification card or poster.[31]\n\nIn determining an individual’s primary language or preferred method of communication, it is important to allow the individual to convey the language in which they “most effectively communicate,” particularly in consideration of any potential sensitivity or trauma relating to a situation or subject matter discussed, the context in which the interaction is taking place, and the method of communicating (i.e., oral/signed versus written), among other factors. Component staff should not make assumptions about an individual’s primary language based on race, color, national origin, or because they appear to be or are D/HOH.\n\nAdditional considerations when identifying language include:\n\nAsking the individual about their region, municipality, village, or specific community of origin, to ensure the correct identification of language; [32] and\n\nRecognizing that individuals who are D/HOH may not communicate using ASL and may have limited proficiency in written and spoken English. They may require support in a sign language from another region or country, the procurement of assistive aid, and/or the procurement of a Deaf or Certified Deaf interpreter (CDI).\n\n3. Quality Assurance and Control\n\nComponents should take reasonable steps to ensure that qualified multilingual staff or contracted personnel who serve as translators, interpreters, or who communicate “in-language” with individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH are competent to do so and have the resources necessary to meet the Department’s requirements.[33]\n\nFor guidance regarding quality assurance related to effective communications with individuals who are D/HOH, see ADA Requirements: Effective Communication, https://www.ada.gov/resources/effective-communication/#crt-page--sidenav.\n\nUse of individuals who are not competent could result in a breach of confidentiality; a conflict of interest; or inaccurate, impartial, or incorrect interpretation, and is therefore discouraged.\n\nAbsent exigent circumstances, Department staff should avoid using the following individuals to provide language assistance services:\n\nFamily members (including children)\n\nNeighbors\n\nFriends\n\nAcquaintances or bystanders\n\nOpposing parties\n\nAdverse witnesses or victims\n\nConsiderations of competency for qualified multilingual staff or contracted personnel may include:\n\nDemonstrated proficiency in and ability to communicate information accurately in both English and the other language.\n\nUsing the appropriate mode of interpreting (e.g., consecutive, simultaneous, or sight translation).\n\nAccurately interpreting or translating materials and rendering meaning using appropriate terminology particular to a component’s program or activity into the language used by the individual with LEP.\n\nUnderstanding and following Department and other applicable confidentiality, impartiality, and ethical rules in compliance with Department expectations.\n\nAbility to understand and maintain the role and observing professional standards for interpreters, translators, or multilingual staff.\n\nUnderstanding the appropriate use of current technologies for providing language assistance, including the proper review and use of machine translation.\n\nNote that for individuals who are D/HOH, this might require a qualified sign language interpreter, a Deaf interpreter, or a CDI.\n\nFor interpreting, components should be aware of potential interpreter fatigue and the possibility that such fatigue can result in errors. Components should consider strategies to address interpreter fatigue for longer proceedings, where possible, including frequent breaks for the interpreter or the use of multiple interpreters.\n\nDepartment staff should also be mindful of asking community-based organizations or other volunteers to provide free language assistance services. Such individuals may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, and knowledge of canons of professional responsibility to provide accurate, impartial, and confidential interpreting. This may also unduly burden an organization’s staff and resources, may constitute a gift under government ethics rules, and/or constitute violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.[34] Components should consult their ethics officer on a case-by-case basis when a volunteer provides language assistance services.\n\n4. Outreach and Engagement with Communities with LEP and/or who are D/HOH\n\nEffective outreach and engagement with communities with LEP and D/HOH communities, and entities that represent their interests, are critical parts of language access planning efforts—both to increase access to component programs and activities for these communities, and to receive regular feedback on the implementation of Department and component language access plans or language assistance services.[35]\n\nWhere appropriate in light of each component’s unique mission and operations, components may consider:\n\nEstablishing and maintaining relationships with a variety of entities representing the interests of individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH, and a variety of those communities who have traditionally been marginalized based on language.\n\nConducting appropriate outreach efforts designed to inform communities and individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH about DOJ component programs and activities.\n\nCommunicating clearly through written, video, and/or audio means about the nature, scope, and availability of language assistance services and how to request them.[36]\n\nIncreasing efforts to encourage participation of these communities in, for example, Department consultations, focus groups, and/or listening sessions, with the goal of learning about their concerns, needs, and perspectives.\n\nTaking reasonable steps to ensure that community outreach events involving individuals with LEP are designed to provide meaningful access, where individuals with LEP can participate, receive information, and provide input in their primary language(s), and ensuring effective communication for D/HOH individuals at such events.\n\nCreating and maintaining lists of non-English press to disseminate information about DOJ programs and activities.\n\nDisseminating information about component programs and activities in non-English languages.\n\nReaching out and partnering with stakeholders to amplify component communications to specific communities that may include individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH.\n\nEstablishing a formal mechanism to receive feedback about the quality of the component’s language assistance services.\n\n5. Procurement\n\nComponents seeking to procure language assistance services should work closely with their Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer Representative, their budget and/or procurement office, and, as needed, the DOJ Language Access Coordinator, when crafting requirements for vendors. Components may also consult with the Justice Management Division to identify existing agency contract vehicles that they can utilize.\n\nComponents are encouraged to pursue resource-sharing and cost-saving initiatives across the Department for language assistance services.[37] Components may consult with the DOJ Language Access Coordinator to help identify resource-sharing possibilities and learn about currently available DOJ language assistance services.\n\nIf a component elects to procure language assistance services, the component’s procurement office should ensure that any Requests for Proposal or contracts specify component needs and vendor responsibilities to include quality control and assurance procedures, assign liability, and contain dispute resolution provisions.\n\nPlease refer to the Language Services Procurement Committee’s Foreign Language Services Ordering Guide for additional information regarding ensuring quality and accuracy in purchasing language assistance services.[38]\n\n6. Allocation of Resources\n\nComponents should consider the appropriate resources needed for language access planning, outreach, and assistance services based on the range of interactions their component has or may have with individuals with LEP and/or individuals who are D/HOH.[39] As permitted by congressional appropriations and resource availability, components should aim to allocate resources in proportion to the level of current and projected interaction that the component has, or may have, with individuals with LEP and/or individuals who are D/HOH, including any projected expansion of language assistance services.\n\n7. Notification of the Availability of Language Assistance Services\n\nWhen language assistance services are not readily available or individuals do not know language assistance services are free and available, individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH are less likely to participate in or benefit from a component’s programs and services. As a result, many individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH may not seek out component benefits, programs, information, and services; may not offer vital assistance in investigations or information that would help determine entitlement or eligibility for benefits; and may not file complaints.\n\nWhere applicable in light of the component’s mission and operations, each component shall take reasonable steps to provide public notice of how to obtain free language assistance services. This information should be offered in different mediums (for example, signage, printed and electronic material, correspondence or mailing of vital documents, social media, radio, etc.) in consultation with program, outreach, and public affairs personnel as well as impacted communities. It should be offered in at least the top language(s) spoken by individuals with LEP based on the program objective, component constituency, and/or geographic area.\n\nIn public-facing materials, components are encouraged to include multilingual taglines to allow individuals, including those who do not speak the top identified languages, to be informed about the availability of language assistance services and know how to request any vital information provided.[40]\n\nIn the cases where the language used by individuals with LEP is oral with no written form or where the individual with LEP being served demonstrates low literacy, components may consider using video or audio recordings of the notification of availability of language assistance services. Video recordings may also benefit individuals who are D/HOH.[41] This notification may also be provided using existing tools and platforms, such as translated website documents, QR codes, and interpreter-mediated stakeholder outreach.[42]\n\nComponents are encouraged to include in their public notices a specific point of contact for obtaining language assistance services. This point of contact could be an office, representative, email address, or telephone number.\n\nComponents are encouraged to post component-specific language access plans and policies on the component’s webpage in languages understood by individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH. Similarly, multilingual, and accessible copies of the Department’s Language Access Plan shall be publicly available on the Department’s website.\n\n8. Provision of Language Assistance Services\n\nThe need for language assistance services will vary by component. Each component will therefore provide tailored guidance to their staff on how to secure language access services that are responsive to the component’s needs.[43] Where appropriate, components should consider using a combination of language assistance services to provide meaningful access. There are three different ways in which component staff may provide language assistance: direct in-language services, interpretation, and translation.\n\nDirect In-language Services\n\nAbsent exigent circumstances, components are strongly discouraged from allowing employees who have not been formally assessed for their multilingual skills to provide direct services in-language.[44] Unqualified staff could provide incorrect information, introduce conflicts of interest or other ethical concerns, or experience other potentially negative consequences for the Department and/or the individual with LEP.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhen appropriate in light of the component’s mission and operations, components should be prepared to provide qualified interpreters, free of charge, either in-person, over-the-phone, or through video remote technology to communicate with individuals with LEP.[45]\n\nWhile individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH have the right to refuse language assistance services, component staff are encouraged in these situations to reiterate the Department’s policy to ensure meaningful access and provide services at no cost. Such refusal should be documented.\n\nWhen arranging or requesting interpretation services, component staff should make every effort to ascertain if the interpreter provided matches the language and/or language variant that the individual(s) with LEP use(s) and that they can understand each other fully.\n\nComponents must also give primary consideration to the method of communication preferred by an individual who is D/HOH. Consistent with that approach there may be a need to utilize a Deaf interpreter, Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI), Communication Access Real-Time Translation (CART), or another auxiliary aid or service requested by the individual.[46]\n\nDOJ has contracts with vendors to provide interpretation in multiple languages. Components may consult with the DOJ Language Access Coordinator regarding these services.\n\nTranslation\n\nThe Department prioritizes the translation of vital documents. Classification of a document as “vital” depends upon the importance of the program, information, encounter, or service involved, and the consequence to the individual with LEP if the information in question is not provided accurately or in a timely manner.[47] Components have discretion to determine what documents are considered “vital.”\n\nThere are two distinct types of vital documents: (1) those that are meant for the general public or a broad audience, and (2) those that are specific communications regarding a case or matter between an individual and the Department.\n\nVital documents intended for the general public, or a broad audience may include, but are not limited to:[48]\n\nPublic outreach or educational materials.\n\nClaim or application forms including their instructions.\n\nForms or written material related to individual rights.\n\nNotices of outreach or community meetings or trainings.\n\nPress releases announcing activities or matters that affect communities with LEP.\n\nNotices regarding the availability of language assistance services provided by the component at no cost to individuals with LEP, where applicable in light of the component’s mission and operations.\n\nCertain consent orders, decrees, Memoranda of Agreement, or other types of pleadings or litigation materials.\n\nComponents are encouraged to translate vital documents for the general public into the top languages, as needed, and to consider translating into other languages as appropriate based on the program objective, constituency, and/or geographic region.[49]\n\nVital documents specific to a case or matter between an individual and the Department may include, but are not limited to:\n\nNotices of case-related community outreach.\n\nAdministrative complaints, release, or waiver forms.\n\nLetters of findings.\n\nLetters or notices pertaining to statutes of limitations, referrals to other federal agencies, a decision to decline to investigate a case or matter, or closure of an investigation, case, or matter.\n\nWritten notices of rights, denial, loss, or decreases in benefits or services, parole, and other hearings.\n\nUnder most circumstances, materials primarily directed to courts, attorneys, court advocates, architects, police, or other professionals will not be considered “vital” for these purposes (this includes court filings associated with litigation or criminal charges). Department components or subcomponents with core litigation functions may also be subject to applicable legal standards that may vary based on pertinent federal local rules. Components will necessarily be guided by those legal standards in making decisions as to translation, and this plan is not intended to supersede or alter those requirements.\n\nEach component should develop its own criteria for identifying vital documents and prioritizing languages for their translation. For vital documents aimed at a national audience, it is recommended that components begin by translating vital information in the top languages spoken by individuals with LEP.[50] Components are encouraged to reassess these criteria each time they review and update their language access plans.\n\nComponents should also ensure that all translations are completed by qualified translators.[51] Components should avoid using machine translation alone without human review and quality control. In particular, machine translation is discouraged when information communicated is vital to a person’s rights or benefits; when accuracy is essential; or when the source materials use non-literal language (like slang or metaphors), have unclear grammar or structure, contain abbreviations or acronyms, or are complicated, technical, or wordy.[52]\n\nIndividuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH who want to access Department services may not be literate in their country of origin’s prevalent written language, or their languages might not have a written form such that translated material will not be an effective way of communicating with them. For individuals with LEP, components may want to consider sight translation, interpretation, or audio/video communication. For individuals who are D/HOH, components should inquire about the preferred method to deliver information that is typically available in written form.[53]\n\nRecognizing that translating vital documents can be costly and time intensive, components are encouraged to seek stakeholder input in determining which documents should be prioritized for translation.\n\n9. Multilingual and Accessible Digital Content\n\nComponents shall take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access for individuals with LEP to digital content produced by the component, for instance multilingual and accessible content on public websites and electronic documents containing information about:\n\nA component’s jurisdiction and mission.\n\nContact information, including how to communicate with the Department or component to report criminal activity or violations of the law, access information for victims of crime, or report and identify missing persons.\n\nHow to file a complaint (including forms and instructions to fill out those forms).[54]\n\nPress releases and important announcements impacting communities with LEP.\n\nEducation material for individuals or communities about their rights under the law.\n\nComponents are encouraged to work with their internal web content staff and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to periodically assess and monitor translated digital content to improve meaningful access for persons with LEP.[55]\n\nThe Department and its components must also comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 508), which requires federal agencies to ensure that their electronic and information technology, including websites, electronic documents, and software applications, are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Components shall work with OCIO to ensure that translated digital content meets Section 508 requirements.\n\n10. Staff Training\n\nDepartment staff need to know how to provide language assistance services. For policies and procedures to be effective, components should ensure that new and existing component staff members periodically receive language access and effective communication training relevant to their job duties. Components should remember language access training needs when assessing professional development requirements for all staff.\n\nWhere applicable in light of the component’s mission and operations, staff should be trained on:\n\nIdentification of individuals with LEP and specific language needs.\n\nIdentification of individuals who are D/HOH and their preferred methods of communication.\n\nLanguage access legal requirements for individuals with LEP.\n\nEffective communication legal requirements for individuals who are D/HOH.\n\nDOJ and component language access policies and plans, including how and when to access language assistance services.\n\nAccessing and providing language assistance services through qualified multilingual staff, in-house interpreters and translators, or contracted personnel.\n\nUse of plain language.[56]\n\nBest practices for working with interpreters in person, over the telephone, or via video remote platforms.\n\nBest practices for working with translators.\n\nInterpreter ethics.\n\nCultural competency.\n\nBest practices for tracking the use of language assistance services.\n\nBest practices for providing meaningful language assistance to individuals with LEP.\n\nBest practices for effective communication with individuals who are D/HOH.\n\nComponents are encouraged to offer technical training to qualified multilingual staff (e.g., interpreter ethics, interactive online language access courses, etc.) to maintain and improve their language assistance skills.\n\nThe DOJ Language Access Coordinator, in collaboration with the DOJ LAWG, will update DOJ’s basic language access training[57] that components should use to train staff who have the potential to interact or communicate with such individuals, as appropriate.\n\nComponents should assess the most effective methods for offering staff training, and the amount and frequency of training required based on the component’s staff level of interaction with individuals with LEP and/or those who are D/HOH.[58]\n\n11. Hiring Practices and Access to Multilingual Staff\n\nThe Department values the multilingual skills of its employees. Qualified multilingual employees include staff whose job descriptions include the provision of direct in-language communication and language assistance, and personnel who volunteer to use their assessed language skills on behalf of the Department.\n\nWhen making decisions about hiring or utilizing multilingual staff, each component should:\n\nAssess the extent to which non-English language proficiency in particular languages is necessary or desired for particular positions or to fulfill the component’s mission.[59]\n\nConsider modifying job descriptions, postings, and pay rates for roles that interact with individuals with LEP to include language proficiency as a position requirement informed by assessment of component language needs.\n\nEnsure hiring practices do not discriminate against individuals who are D/HOH, including by ensuring compliance with Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and recognizing that these individuals may offer valuable insights regarding effective communication with individuals who are D/HOH.\n\nIdentify, assess, and develop the language skills of qualified multilingual employees, as appropriate.\n\nOffer technical training to qualified multilingual staff (e.g., interpreter ethics, translation training, interpreting training, etc.) to maintain and improve their language assistance skills, as appropriate.\n\nDepartment staff should be mindful of the professional responsibility and ethical implications of relying on multilingual internal staff to provide language assistance services in select cases. Should components decide to use employees whose job duties do not already include the provision of spoken language assistance services to provide such services, they should consult with the DOJ Language Access Coordinator and the FBI Language Testing and Assessment Unit to discuss language testing, learn about the language assessment processes, and establish component-specific qualification requirements.[60]\n\nEach component should track the composition of existing and newly qualified multilingual staff by non-English languages spoken and level of oral and written proficiency. Maintaining an inventory of qualified multilingual staff could be useful for future resource-sharing initiatives within and between components. Managers are also encouraged to consider the amount of time an employee has spent providing language assistance services when assessing workload and productivity.\n\n12. Departmental and Interagency Cooperation\n\nComponents are encouraged to collaborate with each other and other federal agencies to share resources, implement best practices, improve efficiency, and standardize federal terminology.\n\nThe Department supports sharing promising practices and exploring Department-wide and interagency initiatives that could potentially streamline and improve our ability to provide meaningful access to individuals with LEP and/or who are D/HOH. To that end, the DOJ LAWG will identify, develop, and distribute useful resources and materials.\n\n13. Performance Measurement and Evaluation\n\nComponents should periodically reassess and, where appropriate, update their language access plans to ensure that the scope and nature of language assistance services provided under the plan reflect updated information on relevant LEP populations, component language assistance needs, changes in technology, and component experience under the plan.\n\nComponents should consider gathering data to assess the effectiveness of component language assistance services. This may include:\n\nConducting an inventory of languages most frequently encountered.\n\nIdentifying the primary channels of contact with LEP community members (whether telephonic, in person, correspondence, web-based, etc.).\n\nIdentifying the extent to which language assistance services were requested, needed and/or accessed by individuals with LEP.\n\nReviewing plans and protocols.\n\nReviewing the annual cost of translation and interpreter services, and\n\nConsulting with outside stakeholders.[61]\n\nTo the extent that components gather data through the methods identified above or in other ways, component staff should consider identifying and tracking the primary language of individuals with LEP and preferred methods of communication of individuals who are D/HOH that seek and receive component programs and services to map out communities and learn about communities’ language needs.\n\nComponents should consult with the DOJ Language Access Coordinator and ATJ for technical assistance and support in developing these metrics.[62]\n\nAppendix A: Definitions\n\nThe Department uses the following terms as defined below for the purposes of this plan:\n\nCertified Deaf Interpreter (CDI).
