        "text": "FEMA exercises the Defense Production Act (DPA) to support the DPA authority and functions of the FEMA Administrator and the FEMA Associate Administrator for the Office of Policy and Program Analysis (OPPA). The support focuses on promoting effective use of DPA authorities by FEMA and other DHS components and providing coordination and guidance for the DPA plans and programs of federal departments and agencies.\n\nUse of DPA Authorities to Support Homeland Security Programs\n\nThe Defense Production Act is the primary source of presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of materials and services from the U.S. industrial base needed to promote the national defense. DPA authorities are available to support: emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of the Stafford Act; protection or restoration of critical infrastructure; and efforts to prevent, reduce vulnerability to, minimize damage from, and recover from acts of terrorism within the United States. DPA authorities may be used to:\n\nRequire acceptance and preferential performance of contracts and orders under DPA Title I. (See Federal Priorities and Allocations System (FPAS).)\n\nProvide financial incentives and assistance (under DPA Title III) for U.S. industry to expand productive capacity and supply needed for national defense purposes;\n\nProvide antitrust protection (through DPA voluntary agreements in DPA Title VII) for businesses to cooperate in planning and operations for national defense purposes, including homeland security.\n\nInformation about other DPA authorities in DPA Title VII.\n\nInformation for DHS Programs about Priority-Rated Orders\n\nThis link provides an overview of the process to place a priority-rated contract or order (“rated orders”) in support of a DHS Approved Program. It answers such questions as: who is responsible for directing use of a rated order; what contracts and orders are eligible for a priority rating; how is a Contracting Officer directed to place a rated order; and how does a contract or order become a rated order?\n\nInformation for Contractors about Priority-Rated Orders\n\nSee this link for questions and answers regarding priority-rated contracts and orders (“rated orders”), under the Defense Production Act. Answers explain what a rated order is, what is required of a contractor to accept and fulfill a rated order, and how issues involving rated orders are handled.\n\nDPA Guidance and Publications\n\nLaw\n\nDefense Production Act of 1950, as Amended.\n\nDelegations of DPA Authority\n\nExecutive Order (E.O.) 13603, National Defense Resources Preparedness, January 3, 2016, delegates authorities and addresses national defense resource policies and programs under the DPA. The DPA authorities and functions delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security in E.O. 13603 are re-delegated to the Administrator of FEMA in DHS Delegation Number 09052, January 3, 2017.\n\nDefense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Delegation 4, March 8, 2016, authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to place DPAS priority-rated contracts and orders (“rated orders”) in support of (1) DHS programs and (2) state, local, tribal, and territorial government emergency preparedness activities. The Secretary's DPAS authority is re-delegated to the Administrator of FEMA, who, in turn, has re-delegated authority to place DPAS rated orders in the following documents:\n\nDHS Delegation Number 09053, January 4, 2016, to: Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection; Assistant Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Administrator, Transportation Security Administration; Director, U.S. Secret Service; Director, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; and Under Secretary for Management;\n\nDelegation of Authority Regarding the Defense Priorities and Allocations System, to the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, January 18, 2017;\n\nDelegation of Authority Regarding the Defense Priorities and Allocations System to the Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, December 2, 2015; and\n\nDelegation of Authority: Defense Priorities and Allocations System, to FEMA personnel, August 7, 2014.\n\nAgriculture Priorities and Allocations System (APAS) Delegation 2, February 22, 2016, authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to place APAS rated orders for food resources. The Secretary's APAS authority is re-delegated to the Administrator of FEMA, who, in turn, has re-delegated authority to various FEMA personnel to place APAS rated orders.\n\nDPA Regulations\n\nThe Federal Priorities and Allocations System (FPAS) is the system of priorities and allocations regulations issued by federal departments that are delegated priorities and allocations under section 201 of E.O. 13603. These regulations all incorporate the same basic standards and procedures for use of the DPA priorities and allocations authorities.\n\nFEMA’s voluntary agreements regulation provides procedures for establishing and carrying out voluntary agreements under Section 708 of the DPA. A “voluntary agreement” is an association of industry, business, financing, agriculture, labor, or other private interests to help provide for the national defense, including emergency preparedness and response activities. Participants in a voluntary agreement are granted relief from antitrust laws under the provisions of Section 708 of the DPA.\n\nDHS DPA Guidance\n\nFederal Priorities and Allocations System\n\nDHS Approved Programs – Section 202 of E.O. 13603 provides that the priorities and allocations authorities “may be used only to support programs that have been determined in writing as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.” Responsibility for making this determination for homeland security programs has been delegated to the Associate Administrator for the Office of Policy and Program Analysis (OPPA) in FEMA. The following programs for which OPPA has made this determination are referred to as “DHS Approved Programs”:\n\nPrograms involving emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to title VI of the Stafford Act\n\nIntelligence and warning systems to counter terrorism within the United States\n\nBorder and transportation security programs to counter terrorism within the United States\n\nPrograms to address chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats within the United States\n\nOther programs, including law enforcement, to counter terrorism within the United States\n\nPrograms to protect or restore critical infrastructure\n\nFederal Government continuity programs and functions.\n\nImplementing Guidance for DHS Use of Priority-Rating Authority Under Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Delegation 4 and Agriculture Priorities and Allocations System (APAS) Delegation 2, November 1, 2022, provides supplemental guidance and procedures for use 0923of DPAS and APAS rated orders for.
