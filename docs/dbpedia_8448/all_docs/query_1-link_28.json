        "text": "Our mission at the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is to ensure that people have equal access and opportunity to participate in HHS-funded programs. We focus on reducing barriers for individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). We also help covered entities understand and comply with their language assistance obligations.\n\nHHS Language Access Plan\n\nMedicaid Unwinding\n\nLEP Resources\n\nYour Right to Language Assistance Services\n\nIf English is not your primary language and you have difficulty communicating in English, you may need an interpreter or document translation when accessing programs funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Examples of these services are when you:\n\nPick up a prescription at the pharmacy\n\nVisit a family member in a nursing home\n\nGo to the emergency room\n\nApply for a health insurance plan\n\nVisit a doctor or dentist\n\nThese types of services likely receive federal financial assistance from HHS or are covered by civil rights authorities enforced by OCR. There are two federal laws that require these programs to provide language access services (LAS) free of charge:\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) and implementing regulations\n\nSection 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Section 1557) and implementing regulations\n\nHHS Language Access Plan\n\nThe HHS Language Access Plan sets forth practical guidance, best practices, and action steps for HHS Operating and Staff Divisions to develop their own, agency-specific language access plans. The plan also calls for agencies to collect data regarding their language access services in order to increase access to their respective programs, activities, and services for persons with limited English proficiency.\n\nRead the HHS Language Access Plan\n\nPlan de Acceso Lingüístico (Spanish)\n\n语言援助计划 (Chinese - Simplified)\n\n語言協助計劃 (Chinese - Traditional)\n\n언어 접근 계획 (Korean)\n\nPlano sa Pag-access ng Wika (Tagalog)\n\nKế Hoạch Tiếp Cận Ngôn Ngữ (Vietnamese)\n\nPlan d'Accès Linguistique (French)\n\nللوصول اللغوي (Arabic)\n\nRead the press release (November 15, 2023) (available in 7 languages)\n\nStaffing and Operating Division Language Access Plans\n\nAs mandated by the 2023 HHS Language Access Plan and to celebrate the 24th anniversary of Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” the Department has released division-specific language access plans. This effort by nearly all HHS operating and staff divisions exemplifies the Department’s commitment to providing accessible, culturally and linguistically effective, and comprehensive health care and human services."
