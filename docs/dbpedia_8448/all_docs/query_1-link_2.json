Experience the slides and some recordings from some of our speakers. Speakers addressed debunking myths, meeting varying audienceâ€™s needs, managing the review process and stakeholders, and supporting plain language editors.\n\nAbout us\n\nThe Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a community of federal employees dedicated to the idea that citizens deserve clear communication from government. We believe that using plain language saves federal agencies time and money and provides better service to the American public.\n\nJoin the Plain Language Community\n\nLearn about upcoming events and get the latest news from the federal plain language community.\n\nJoin the community"
