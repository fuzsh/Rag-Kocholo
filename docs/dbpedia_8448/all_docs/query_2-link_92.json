        "text": "Holidays are a welcome break, and a chance to celebrate important events.\n\nThe Federal Government recognizes 11 holidays. However, several things can affect when you observe your holidays such as your alternative work schedule (if you work one) and if you work full time or part-time. There are also special rules for state and local holidays for employees who work outside the Washington DC metropolitan area.\n\nFederal Holidays\n\nNew Year’s Day January 1\n\nMartin Luther King’s Birthday 3rd Monday in January\n\nWashington’s Birthday 3rd Monday in February\n\nMemorial Day last Monday in May\n\nJuneteenth National Independence Day June 19\n\nIndependence Day July 4\n\nLabor Day 1st Monday in September\n\nColumbus Day 2nd Monday in October\n\nVeterans’ Day November 11\n\nThanksgiving Day 4th Thursday in November\n\nChristmas Day December 25\n\nInauguration Day Holiday\n\nIf you work in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area, you will have 1 additional holiday, Inauguration Day. This holiday falls on January 20th of every 4th year. If you are working in Washington on this day (even if you normally are assigned elsewhere), it will be a holiday. If you are on travel elsewhere, it will not.\n\nIf Inauguration Day falls on a Sunday, the next day chosen for observance of Inauguration Day is the holiday.\n\nIf Inauguration Day falls on a Saturday, Federal employees in the DC area who do not work on Saturday will not receive an Inauguration Day holiday.\n\nDetermining Your Holiday Day Off\n\nNormally, if you’re scheduled to work on a Federal holiday, you’ll have that day off and you’ll be paid normally, whether you’re a full-time or part-time employee.\n\nIf you work on an intermittent schedule (daily, hourly, piece-work, etc.), you don’t receive paid holidays or replacement holidays for days off, and if you work on a holiday, you don’t receive premium pay.\n\nReplacement or In-Lieu-Of Holidays\n\nSome employees can’t observe the holiday on the day designated as the holiday because of their work schedule. These employees get a “replacement or in-lieu-of holiday.”\n\nPart-time employees do not get replacement holidays if the holiday falls on one of their scheduled non-work days. If you’re a part-time employee, you may be given administrative leave if you are unable to work because an office is closed to provide a replacement holiday for other employees.\n\nWorking on a Holiday\n\nA shift that overlaps two days, one of which is a holiday, is considered a holiday throughout.\n\nIf you have to work on the Federal holiday, you’ll be paid at the holiday premium rate for your scheduled non-overtime hours, whether you’re a full or part-time employee.\n\nSpecial rules apply if you work outside the U.S., if your normal work week is not Monday-Friday.\n\nState and Local Holidays\n\nIf you work at an office or other site outside of the Washington DC area, you will normally be given an excused absence and your workplace will be closed on state, local, territorial or foreign holidays celebrated locally. Whether or not you get the day off is based on a determination by the head of your operating unit that work can’t be performed effectively because of the holiday.\n\nUnscheduled state and local holidays will not automatically result in the closing of your workplace.\n\nYour office will be closed for unscheduled holidays only if the building where you work is closed, building services are unavailable, local transportation services are unavailable, or your primary duties involve interaction with people and organizations that will be observing the holiday.\n\nIf your office is closed, the day is a non-workday and:\n\nNo personal leave is charged for the time off\n\nIf your group (but not all employees at the site) is affected by a building closing, you will be given an excused absence for the time missed.\n\nYou can’t be given an excused absence for personal reasons related to a local holiday (such as at the request of an employee to attend a local ceremony); absence will be charged to leave."
