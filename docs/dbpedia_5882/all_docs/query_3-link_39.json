        "text": "Background\n\nErected by Micheli in 1729, the genus Botrytis is one of the first described genera of fungi. Persoon (1801) designated five species under the binomial system of Linnaeus, validated the genus, and included one of Micheli’s species, B. cinerea, so named by Von Haller (1771). The genus name refers to the structure of the macroconidia, which rise and form clusters with the shape of grape bunches: ‘botryose’. Botrytis is the asexual stage of Botryotinia. The Botrytis community has in its recent meeting (Italy, 23–28 June 2013) unanimously recommended the exclusive use of the asexual name Botrytis over Botryotinia, the name of the sexual stage, since Botrytis is historically the oldest name and it is commonly used by plant pathologists, breeders and growers. In line with this recommendation, a list of generic names of fungi for protection under the International Code of Nomenclature has included this genus under the name Botrytis and not Botryotinia (Kirk et al. 2013). We therefore follow this recommendation in this paper and use Botrytis. Species of the genus Botrytis infect >250 host species, including major greenhouse and field crops such as tomato, grape, strawberry, onion and ornamentals such as rose, lily, and tulip (Staats et al. 2005). Most Botrytis species are necrotrophic pathogens that (are able to) kill the host tissue during infection. Interestingly, an endophytic species (B. deweyae) has recently been discovered, which under appropriate conditions can cause ‘spring sickness’ in ornamental Hemerocallis (daylily) hybrids (Grant-Downton et al. 2014). Botrytis cinerea is the best-studied species in the genus (Williamson et al. 2007) and was recently elected as the second most important plant pathogenic fungal species (Dean et al. 2012).\n\nIn the asexual state, Botrytis produces different tissues including mycelia, macroconidia, microconidia, and sclerotia. Macroconidia are ellipsoidal to obovoid shape and rise from conidiophore branches into botryose clusters. They are pale brown and range in size from 9–23 × 8–15 μm. Microconidia are more sphaerical and much smaller than macroconidia (about 1 μm), and function as male spermatia (Groves and Loveland 1953; Faretra et al. 1988; Beever and Parkes 1993; Fukumori et al. 2004). Sclerotia are irregularly hemispherical, convex and normally have a concave surface. They are usually black, with sizes ranging between 1 and 10 mm (Whetzel 1945), and function as survival structures during winter and serve as maternal parent in the production of apothecia.\n\nThe sexual state forms fruiting bodies called apothecia: a cup- or open saucer-shaped ascoma at the top of a stalk, that acts as a platform to discharge ascospores from the ascus. Botrytis apothecia vary in size depending on the species, between 1 and 25 mm high and 1–6 mm diam. (Hennebert and Groves 1963; Bergquist and Lorbeer 1972). Apothecia are brown and become darker when mature (Hennebert and Groves 1963; Bergquist and Lorbeer 1972; Faretra and Antonacci 1987). Generally multiple apothecia can develop on a single sclerotium. Mature apothecia normally can be observed 2 months after fertilization (Faretra et al. 1988; Hennebert and Groves 1963; Van Der Vlugt-Bergmans et al. 1993). In the genus Botrytis, both homothallic and heterothallic reproductive lifestyles have been reported. Homothallic (self-fertile) species can undergo sexual reproduction and form apothecia and generate progeny in the absence of a mating partner, e.g. B. porri and B. globosa (Buchwald 1953; Elliott 1964). By contrast, heterothallic (self-sterile, self-incompatible) species require isolates with compatible mating types in order to complete the sexual cycle. B. cinerea is considered a typical heterothallic fungus (Elliott 1964; Faretra et al. 1988). Mating is controlled by the mating type locus with two alleles, MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 (Faretra et al. 1988), each carrying two distinct, non-homologous genes (Amselem et al. 2011).\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nApproximately half of the Botrytis species are named after the host that they are derived from (listed in Table 5). One hybrid species, B. allii which originated from hybridization between B. byssoidea and B. aclada (Nielsen and Yohalem 2001; Yohalem et al. 2003) could not be placed in the phylogeny (Staats et al. 2005) and was omitted from Table 3. The genus Botrytis predominantly comprises narrow host range pathogens that infect a single, or a few (often related) host species. There are two exceptions to this rule: B. cinerea can infect more than 200 host species (Jarvis 1977), and B. pseudocinerea has been isolated from several unrelated host species (Fournier et al. 2005; Leroch et al. 2013).\n\nThe taxonomic classification and nomenclature in Botrytis have rarely been comprehensively reviewed. Morphological descriptions of most species have been published in the 19th and first half of the 20th century in separate papers, many of which are not easily accessible. The most recent taxonomic compilation of the genus is in a monograph by Jarvis (1977), which also lists ~25 excluded or doubtful species, and briefly describes the historical debates between mycologists and the confusion in classification of Botrytis species. Morphological features were often inadequate to distinguish species and the variability among isolates of the same species further complicated the situation (Jarvis 1977). Recent studies have identified B. cinerea and B. pseudocinerea as species that are very similar in morphology, yet recognized as distinct taxa that diverged several million years ago (Walker et al. 2011). Even more puzzling, the morphology and narrow host range of B. fabae separate this species clearly from B. cinerea and B. pseudocinerea, but phylogenetic studies revealed it to be a sister species of B. cinerea (see below). These examples illustrate the limitations of morphological characters for Botrytis species identification.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nHolst-Jensen et al. (1998) were the first to use nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences to infer a phylogeny of the family Sclerotiniaceae, including several members of the genus Botrytis. The relationships among many Botrytis species could not be resolved because of the limited number of informative characters, however the study permitted the conclusion that Botryotinia asexual morphs along with Botrytis sexual morphs constitute a monophyletic lineage (Holst-Jensen et al. 1998). The phylogeny of the Sclerotiniaceae was further refined by Andrew et al. (2012) using three protein-coding genes: calmodulin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH and heat shock protein HSP60.\n\nStaats et al. (2005) performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus Botrytis, at that time comprising 22 recognized species and one hybrid. Using three protein-coding genes (G3PDH, HSP60 and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit II gene RPB2), they corroborated the morphological and host plant-based classification of Botrytis spp. and divided the genus into two (rather widely separated) clades. Clade I contained species that only infect eudicot plants, while Clade II contained species that can infect either eudicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants. The use of the same three genes facilitated the discovery of Botrytis sinoallii, a new species infecting Allium spp., and its distinction from other Botrytis spp. infecting the same hosts (Zhang et al. 2010b); B. fabiopsis, a new species infecting broad bean, very distant from B. fabae (Zhang et al. 2010a); and B. caroliniana, a new species infecting blackberry (Li et al. 2012).\n\nTwo genes, encoding phytotoxic proteins NEP1 and NEP2, were shown to provide higher resolution in distinguishing species in the genus Botrytis because they seem to be the subject of higher evolutionary rates than the housekeeping genes G3PDH, HSP60 and RPB2 (Staats et al. 2007a). The NEP1 and NEP2 genes were shown to have evolved under positive selection which suggested a role of these proteins in the infection process (Staats et al. 2007a). One might therefore infer that such genes cannot serve as neutral phylogenetic markers. Functional analysis in B. cinerea and B. elliptica using targeted knockout mutants failed to reveal a role of NEP genes in virulence of these two species (Staats et al. 2007b; Cuesta Arenas et al. 2010), which would lend support to considering these genes as neutral markers and adequate tools in phylogeny.\n\nThe studies by Staats et al. (2005) revealed incongruence between the phylogenies of Botrytis spp. and their hosts. Species infecting the same host clustered in different (sub) clades, e.g. B. aclada, B. squamosa, B. porri, B. byssoidea and B. sinoallii all infecting Allium. Conversely, closely related species can infect very different hosts, e.g. B. elliptica infecting the monocotyledonous host Lilium and B. ficariarum infecting the dicotyledonous host Ficaria (Staats et al. 2005). More recently, similar incongruence has been reported for newly described species, e.g. B. fabiopsis infecting Vicia faba is very distant from B. fabae infecting the same host (Zhang et al. 2010a), and B. caroliniana infecting blackberries and strawberries is very distant from B. cinerea (Li et al. 2012).\n\nRecently, Khan et al. (2013) combined data from ITS and IGS regions with the G3PHD gene, with the aim of improving molecular identification of Botrytis species that cause neck rot disease on onion. ITS and IGS regions were insufficiently informative to distinguish B. allii and B. byssoidea. The sequences of ITS and IGS for B. allii and B. byssoidea confirmed that they have a close relationship, but G3PDH sequences of several B. allii isolates were clearly distinct, some clustering with B. aclada and others clustering with B. byssoidea (Khan et al. 2013), as might be expected for a hybrid species.\n\nSequence analysis of the G3PDH and β-tubulin genes amplified from herbarium specimens of Botrytis collected from grey mould-infected apple (deposited in 1932) enabled O’Gorman et al. (2008) to corroborate the existence of B. mali, a species that had been published (Ruehle 1931), but by lack of description was considered doubtful.\n\nFigure 4 shows a maximum likelihood tree of Botrytis spp., based on concatenated sequences of parts of the three genes G3PDH, HSP60 and RPB2 (amplified using primers defined by Staats et al. (2005). Five species described after publication of the phylogeny by Staats et al. (2005), i.e. B. caroliniana, B. deweyae, B. fabiopsis, B. pseudocinerea and B. sinoallii, clearly cluster within the genus and are genuine Botrytis species. Botrytis mali could not be included in the tree due to lack of sequences for the HSP60 and RPB2 genes. Based on G3PDH and ß-tubulin sequences it would cluster with B. paeoniae (O’Gorman et al. 2008).\n\nThe Botrytis cinerea species complex\n\nThe Botrytis ‘dicot’ clade I consists of B. cinerea, B. pelargonii, B. fabae, B. pseudocinerea and B. calthae. Molecular data do not fully support a separation between B. pelargonii and B. cinerea (Staats et al. 2005, 2007a; Plesken et al. 2014), and the existence of B. pelargonii as a separate species is therefore doubtful. As mentioned above, B. cinerea and B. pseudocinerea are morphologically very similar yet phylogenetically more distant from each other than B. cinerea and B. fabae. All genes tested so far place B. calthae as most remote to all other clade I species.\n\nBotrytis cinerea not only has a broad host range, but also shows considerable phenotypic variability in vegetative growth, conidiation and sclerotium formation (Kerssies et al. 1997; Martinez et al. 2003; Schumacher et al. 2013). Numerous studies have documented a similar variability in genotypic characters, such as amplified restriction length polymorphism, detection of transposable elements and microsatellite heterogeneity. Recently, B. cinerea strains have been described that produce bikaverin, a reddish pigment. These strains contain an intact bikaverin biosynthesis gene cluster (presumably acquired by horizontal gene transfer from Fusarium), which is partially deleted and nonfunctional in most non-bikaverin producing B. cinerea strains (Campbell et al. 2012; Schumacher et al. 2013\n\nA subdivision of B. cinerea into genetically distinct groups has proved to be difficult. Analysis of the presence or absence of two types of transposable elements, named Boty (Diolez et al. 1995) and Flipper (Levis et al. 1997), was adopted as a tool to divide isolates into four transposon types, Transposa (isolates having both elements), Vacuma (isolates having neither element), Boty and Flipper (Giraud et al. 1997, 1999). This classification led to the discovery of B. pseudocinerea, which is usually Vacuma, but the transposon-based classification turned out to be of limited use since B. cinerea populations appear to consist of mixtures of different transposon types. Intriguingly, predominance of a certain type appears to be influenced by the host. While on grapes, strawberries and tomatoes, Transposa types are predominant, whereas B. cinerea populations from kiwi and apples are dominated by Vacuma types (Esterio et al. 2011; Johnston et al. 2013; Muñoz et al. 2002; Samuel et al. 2012; M. Hahn, unpublished). Reasons for this observation are unknown.\n\nEvidence for genetic differentiation of B. cinerea populations with different host preference was obtained with microsatellite markers. In France, isolates from grapes and blackberries were shown to be divergent, indicating limited gene flow between populations on these host plants (Fournier and Giraud 2008). A recent study on grey mould isolates from fungicide-treated strawberry fields revealed the existence of a predominant B. cinerea genotype, named group S, that is closely related to but distinct from the common genotype of B. cinerea (Leroch et al. 2013). Sequencing of the highly polymorphic MRR1 gene revealed that group S isolates show more than 4 % divergence from B. cinerea strains B05.10 and T4, which have MRR1 genes with 99.9 % identity. Further sequencing of HSP60 and NEP2, and of two FUNYBASE genes that are suitable for phylogenetic studies (Marthey et al. 2008), partially supported the genetic separation of group S isolates (Johnston et al. 2013; Leroch et al. 2013). Genome sequencing of several B. cinerea and group S strains, and the analysis of additional polymorphic genes in isolates collected from various host plants in different countries, revealed at least two subclades that could be separated from the common B. cinerea genotype (Plesken and Hahn, unpublished). In fungicide-treated strawberry fields group S isolates dominated, whereas grapes were infected almost exclusively by common B. cinerea genotypes. These data, together with those of putative new endophytic Botrytis taxa that grouped close to B. cinerea (Shipunov et al. 2008), support the idea that B. cinerea represents a species complex, comprising genetically and phenotypically distinct groups.\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nG3PDH, RPB2 and HSP60—placement within the Sclerotiniaceae and the ascomycetes\n\nNEP1 and NEP2—for higher resolution within the genus Botrytis,\n\nThe NEP1 and NEP2 genes are under positive selection (Staats et al. 2007a) and potentially influence interactions with the host plants. The NEP genes should therefore be used with caution.\n\nResearch is ongoing to identify a set of highly polymorphic genes that better resolve the phylogeny of taxa in clade I (Hahn et al., unpublished). It remains to be established whether those gene are equally useful for resolving the clade II species, and whether universal primers can be designed before these genes can be employed to infer a comprehensive phylogeny of the entire genus.\n\nBackground\n\nThe genus Colletotrichum was introduced by Corda (1831) and belongs to the family Glomerellaceae (Glomerellales, Ascomycota). Colletotrichum is a coelomycetous phytopathogenic genus with a Glomerella sexual state that includes a number of important pathogens causing diseases of crops and fruits worldwide (Cai et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2012; Doyle et al. 2013). Colletotrichum species have furthermore been recorded as endophytes in angiosperms, conifers, ferns, lichens and grasses (Hofstetter et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b; Cannon et al. 2012; McKenzie et al. 2009; Petrini et al. 1990; Manamgoda et al. 2013; Tao et al. 2013). This genus was voted the eighth most important group of plant pathogenic fungi in the world, based on perceived scientific and economic importance (Dean et al. 2012). Colletotrichum species commonly cause anthracnose resulting in sunken necrotic lesions on leaves, stems, flowers and fruits of numerous hosts, including important crops (Lenne 2002; Waller et al. 2002; Agrios 2005; Cai et al. 2009; Than et al. 2008; Peng et al. 2012; Doyle et al. 2013). It is therefore important to plant health disease practitioners, quarantine personnel and plant breeders to know what species infect which crops (Huang et al. 2013b; Lima et al. 2013; Giaretta et al. 2010; Sangeetha and Rawal 2010; Liu et al. 2009a; Akinbode and Ikotun 2008; Adegbite and Amusa 2008; Peres et al. 2002). Therefore, having a rigid and stable taxonomy for the identification of Colletotrichum species is a significant practical concern (Shenoy et al. 2007). Identification of Colletotrichum species has been difficult due to the lack of reliable morphological features and confused, ambiguous species boundaries (Hyde et al. 2009a, b; Cai et al. 2009). Difficulties in recognising Colletotrichum species has resulted from having a few and variable morphological characters, widespread host ranges and pathogenicity, lost specimens or type specimens in poor condition and incorrectly named sequences in NCBI (Freeman et al. 2000; Du et al. 2005; Thaung 2008; Crouch et al. 2009a, b; Damm et al. 2009; Cai et al. 2009).\n\nColletotrichum species are extensively studied as model organisms for research in genetics (Cannon et al. 2012). The pathogenicity genes of C. higginsianum were discovered by random mutagenesis (Huser et al. 2009). Genomes and transcriptomes of C. higginsianum and C. graminicola were studied through the use of two different infection strategies by O’Connell et al. (2012). Work on the genetics of pathogenicity in the C. orbiculare species aggregate led to transformation of pathogenic strains to endophytic forms (Cannon et al. 2012). Gene manipulation techniques such as Agrobacterium tumefacien-mediated transformation or protoplast transformation were established (Tsuji et al. 2003). Peroxisome biogenesis genes, PEX6 and PEX13 were identified and their pathogenesis was functionally analyzed (Fujihara et al. 2010). The importance of the pexophagy factor ATG26 for apressorium formation was discovered by Asakura et al. (2009). Whole genomes of C. higginsianum and C. graminicola have been sequenced (O’Connell et al. 2012). Correct species identification is essential in plant pathogenic genera. In order to have effective measures to prevent the unwanted entry of diseases in to a country, the plant pathologists should be able to name the Colletotrichum species confidently. Therefore, pathologists need to be able to clarify and identify the species of Colletotrichum using the wide genetic variation among the taxa (Cannon et al. 2000).\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nColletotrichum species have been traditionally named after their hosts. The history of naming Colletotrichum species has been reviewed in several key papers (Cannon et al. 2008, 2012; Hyde et al. 2009a). Cai et al. (2009) outlined the recent polyphasic protocols for species identification: A total of 25 Colletotrichum species have been epitypified, one has been neotypified and three have been lectotypified (Cannon et al. 2008; Damm et al. 2009, 2012a, b, 2013; Doyle et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2011a, b, 2013; Su et al. 2011; Weir and Johnston 2010; Weir et al. 2012). Significant changes to the understanding of Colletotrichum species took place with incorporation of these polyphasic approaches, especially the use of multi-marker phylogenetic analysis, classification and knowledge of species complexes, as well as epitypifications for many species (Cai et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013; Doyle et al. 2013; Su et al. 2011; Weir et al. 2012). Cannon et al. (2012) studied nearly all presently sequenced species in the genus using a six-gene analysis, and revealed at least nine clades; 119 species previously thought to be well circumscribed proved to be polyphyletic. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Cannon et al. 2008; Phoulivong et al. 2010a, b; Weir et al. 2012), C. acutatum (Marcelino et al. 2008; Shivas and Tan 2009; Damm et al. 2012a), C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012b), C. orbiculare (Damm et al. 2013) form important species complexes within Colletotrichum and well-resolved among all the nine clades. Further studies in the C. gloeosporioides species complex led to identification of C. murrayae (Peng et al. 2012), C. viniferum (Peng et al. 2013), C. citricola (Huang et al. 2013b), C. fructivorum (Doyle et al. 2013), C. melanocaulon (Doyle et al. 2013), C. temperatum (Doyle et al. 2013), C. endophyticta (Manamgoda et al. 2013) and C. syzygicola (Udayanga et al. 2013). Tao et al. (2013) introduced seven new species; four species belonging to the graminicola clade, two species belonging to the spaethianum clade and one singleton species. Damm et al. (2013) resolved C. orbiculare and introduced four new species. Crouch (2014) introduced a new species complex, C. caudatum, with five new species found on warm-season grasses, characterized by the conidial apex reducing into a filiform appendage. The current numbers of species recognised in the genus are listed in Table 7.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nSome species such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were defined using ITS sequence data, but the outcome was not good partially due to prolific misidentification in GenBank and because ITS does not resolve Colletotrichum species well. In Colletotrichum, species definitions based on ITS sequence data, the “universal” DNA barcoding marker for fungal species has proved unsatisfactory (Du et al. 2005; Crouch et al. 2009b; García et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2012; Doyle et al. 2013; Gunjan et al. 2013). Comparison of a phylogenetic tree of Colletotrichum species derived from ITS sequence alone and one generated from multi-marker data confirms that ITS resolves major clades well, although it does not reflect their higher-order relationships accurately in all cases (Cannon et al. 2012). Cannon et al. (2012) suggested that a robust sequence-based identification system for Colletotrichum species must therefore use an alternative molecular marker or a combination of markers. Damm et al. (2012a) indicated that the most diagnostic markers are β-tubulin and GPDH. β-tubulin performed marginally better than GPDH due to a larger overall number of base pair differences, but even so, some clades differed only by one base pair in the β-tubulin alignment. As single genes that were used are not efficient to differentiate the species, Cai et al. (2009) suggested using multiple markers. Cannon et al. (2012), Weir et al. (2012), and Damm et al. (2012a, b) used several genetic markers: actin (act), chitin synthase (chs1 β-tubulin and ITS which revealed that Colletotrichum comprises nine major clades as well as a number of small clusters and singleton species. Many recent studies used multimarker phylogeny including actin (act), chitin synthase (chs1), β-tubulin, calmodulin (cal), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydogenase (gadph), histamine (HIS3), glutamine synthetase (GS), DNA lyase (apn2), intergenic region of apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes (ApMat) (Weir et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, b; Cannon et al. 2012; Peng et al. 2012; Doyle et al. 2013; Gunjan et al. 2013) to understand the phylogenetic divergence of Colletotrichum species. There is, however, no agreement among mycologists as to which genetic markers should be used (Doyle et al. 2013; Gunjan et al. 2013). Silva et al. (2012) stressed the need to use ‘powerful genes’ such as ApMat and Apn25L. The Apmat marker provides better resolution as compared to the genetic markers used by Weir et al. (2012), Silva et al. (2012), Doyle et al. (2013) and Gunjan et al. (2013). Up to now it has been a better gene-marker for resolving species within C. gloeosporioides species complex (Doyle et al. 2013; Gunjan et al. 2013). Only ITS sequences are available for several species of Colletotrichum showing the need of sequencing the other important gene regions and those species were not included in this analysis. Here we present an analysis using six genetic markers for all the Colletotrichum species that are accepted (Fig. 6) and for the C. acutatum species complex (Fig. 7). Figure 8 presents the analysis of C. gloeosporioides species complex using the apmat gene. The whole genomes of several species of Colletotrichum have been sequenced, such that it is now possible to carry out whole-genome analysis, and compare this with single gene analysis to establish a gene (or gene combinations) that can really resolve species in the genus.\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nITS alone will not resolve species in the genus, but it can separate taxa to species complexes. Multigene analysis using the following genes has been recommended for a backbone tree for species of Colletotrichum:\n\nGPDH–Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase- resolves to species level, more accurate.\n\nβ-tubulin–Beta-tubulin resolves to species level\n\nApMat–Intergenic region of apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes can resolve within the C. gloeosporioides complex\n\nGS–glutamine synthetase–CHS-1. HIS3–Histone3 and ACT–Actin–Placement within the genus and also some species-level delineation.\n\nThese marker combinations can resolve the phylogenetic positions of most species in the genus. GPDH alone can delineate the majority of species. However, research is ongoing to identify better genetic markers to resolve the phylogenetic position of many species of Colletotrichum.\n\nBackground\n\nPestalotiopsis is an appendage-bearing conidial asexual coelomycetous genus in the family Amphisphaeriaceae, Xylariales, Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota) (Barr 1975; Kang et al. 1998) that is common in tropical and temperate ecosystems (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2011, 2012). The sexual state is Pestalosphaeria and only 13 species are known as compared to the asexual state (253 species names). Species of Pestalotiopsis cause a variety of disease in plants, including canker lesions, shoot dieback, leaf spots, needle blight, tip blight, grey blight, scabby canker, severe chlorosis, fruit rots and leaf spots (Espinoza et al. 2008; Maharachchikumbura et al. 2013a, b; Tagne and Mathur 2001). Species belonging to the genus Pestalotiopsis are thought to be a rich source for bioprospecting, and chemical exploration of endophytic Pestalotiopsis species is on the increase (Aly et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2010, 2014). Pestalotiopsis species have been recorded as saprobes where they are recyclers of dead plant material (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012) and are also known to cause human and animal infections (Pestalotiopsis clavispora) (Monden et al. 2013).\n\nMost Pestalotiopsis names in the literature are described based on host association. However, molecular data have shown that the genus needs revision (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2011, 2012; Zhang et al. 2013c), and many of the traditional species may be spurious. There are also numerous cryptic species, very few distinct species, species with wide host ranges, those with cosmopolitan distribution and some species being opportunistic pathogens. This calls for critical re-examination of the genus, using both morphological studies and a multi-marker phylogeny based on ex-type and ex-epitype cultures (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012, 2013c).\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nAccording to Index Fungorum (2014) there are 253 Pestalotiopsis names, while in MycoBank (2014) there are 264 names. The reason for the large number of names is historical and may not reflect the actual number of species (Jeewon et al. 2004). Kohlmeyer and Kohlmeyer (2001) described P. juncestris, which was isolated from the host Juncus roemerianus; this species is morphologically similar to P. versicolor and several other species of Pestalotiopsis, but the taxon was described as a new species based on the host occurrence. However, recent molecular data have shown that host association and geographical location is less informative for distinguishing taxa (Jeewon et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2007). Isolation of endophytic Pestalotiopsis strains for bioprospecting for new biochemical compounds has shown that the same species can be found in a range of hosts. It has been shown that most of the key conidial characters used in species level separation are not stable and vary with host range, generation, culture and other environmental conditions (Hu et al. 2007). Furthermore, the arrangement of species by Steyaert (1949) and Guba (1961) in various coloured groupings is problematic because this character has been shown to be variable within a species (Liu et al. 2010). Thus, most species in the above arrangements may be confused and many species are probably synonyms. Therefore, most of the species recorded in checklists and the literature may not reflect what actually occurs. Thus, many names assigned to Pestalotiopsis probably lack any accurate taxonomic basis, leaving the taxonomy of the genus markedly confused. Until 1990, phylogenetic understanding of the taxonomy associated with Pestalotiopsis and allied genera was based mainly on conidial characters (Steyaert 1949; Guba 1961; Nag Rag 1993), conidiogenesis (Sutton 1980) and sexual state association (Barr 1975). More recently, some new species have been introduced based on host occurrence, plus morphological and molecular data (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012, 2013a, b; Strobel et al. 2000). Furthermore, currently only 36 Pestalotiopsis species have either ex-type or ex-epitype sequences.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nRecently, many Pestalotiopsis species have been defined using ITS sequence data, however, there are only a few type cultures available for Pestalotiopsis. For example, Pestalotiopsis clavispora, P. disseminata, P. microspora, P. neglecta, P. photiniae, P. theae, P. virgatula and P. vismiae have numerous ITS sequences in GenBank. However, in phylogenetic studies all these species scattered throughout the phylogram and there appears to be no living ex-type strain for any of these species (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2011). Therefore it is unwise to use GenBank sequences to represent any of these names. Rapid development in molecular phylogeny has had a great impact on Pestalotiopsis taxonomy. For example, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) can be used to detect genetic diversity in the genus (Tejesvi et al. 2007). Watanabe et al. (2012) evaluated the use of the ITS2 region and showed that it is conserved at the level of secondary structure rather than the level of primary sequence, which can be used for classification of the Pestalotiopsis. Hu et al. (2007) showed that the ITS region is less informative than the β-tubulin gene in differentiating endophytic species of Pestalotiopsis in Pinus armandii and Ribes spp. A combination of β-tubulin and ITS gave improved phylogenetic resolution, and they suggested that at least two genetic markers should be used to resolve the phylogeny of species of Pestalotiopsis. However, Liu et al. (2010) disagreed with above statement concerning the ITS region as being less informative when compared to the β-tubulin region. They indicated that alignment of the ITS region can be a useful character in grouping Pestalotiopsis to different types of pigmentation, which can be used as a key character for the phylogeny of the species. In order to select suitable markers for better species resolution, Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012) analyzed a combined ACT, β-tubulin, CAL, GPDH, GS, ITS, LSU, RPB 1, SSU and TEF dataset. They compared the morphological data versus the sequence data from each gene to establish which characters satisfactorily resolve the species. They narrowed down the 10 gene regions to three most applicable regions (ITS, β-tubulin and TEF), which were tested individually and in combination, to evaluate the differences between species. The species sequenced with ITS had a high PCR and sequence success rate and β-tubulin and TEF gene regions proved to be favourable taxonomic markers for Pestalotiopsis since they resolved the taxonomic relationships of most species studied. Further, TEF had better PCR amplification success rates and was found to be superior to β-tubulin. TEF is therefore a powerful tool to resolve lineages within Pestalotiopsis. Because of the better PCR and sequencing success rate and fewer difficulties with alignment, editing and better resolution, the TEF gene appears to be a very good molecular marker for phylogenetic investigation of Pestalotiopsis. Furthermore, a combination of ITS, β-tubulin and TEF gene data gave the best resolution as compared to any single marker (Table 17, Fig. 18). In addition to the above three markers, the authors also tested LSU, SSU, ACT and GPDH (low resolution), GS and RPB1 (cannot be synthesized using available primers or multiple copies) and CAL (species resolution is high, PCR success rate low).\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nThe large subunits of nrDNA (LSU)–placement within the Amphisphaeriaceae (generic level)\n\nThe internal transcribed spacer (ITS), β-tubulin and TEF–species level (as outlined in Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012)\n\nBackground\n\nWhile resembling Eumycotan fungi with the production of hyphae, the genus is placed in the kingdom Straminipila, class Oomycetes, order Peronosporales, and family Peronosporacae. The type species is P. infestans described by de Bary in 1876. Since this time over 128 species have been described, many of which are important plant pathogens capable of significantly impacting agricultural production and natural ecosystems. Some species have a rather narrow host range (P. infestans, P. lateralis, P. sojae) while others are capable of infecting a wide range of plant host species (P. cinnamomi, P. nicotianae, P. ramorum). From a historical perspective, most investigations on the genus have focused on the impact of the genus on agricultural production systems, however, more recently there has been an increased interest in investigating the role this genus plays in natural ecosystems as exemplified by the number of publications concerning species such as P. ramorum and P. alni, as well as the description of many new species recovered from environmental sampling (Martin et al. 2012).\n\nAlthough Phytophthora species resemble Eumycotan fungi with the production of hyphae, evolutionarily they are more closely related to chromophyte algae and plats than to Eumycotan fungi (Wainright et al. 1993). They have cell walls that are primarily cellulose rather than chitin as observed in fungi and they are incapable of synthesizing β-hydroxysterols (which are required for synthesis of hormones regulating sexual reproduction). In addition, Oomycetes are diploid throughout their life cycle in contrast to most true fungi.\n\nAn excellent overview of the ecology, biology and taxonomy of the genus (although missing more recently described species) can be found in Erwin and Ribeiro (1996), a review of the recent taxonomic status in Kroon et al. (2012) and an overview of the genus, including molecular identification and diagnostics, in Martin et al. (2012). There are several publically available databases that provide a wealth of up to date information on the genus, along with sequences useful for species identification via BLAST analysis, including the Phytophthora Database (www.phytophthoradb.org), Phytophthora ID (www.phytophthora-id.org) and Q-Bank (www.q-bank.eu). Cline et al. (2008) have published an online list of Phytophthora spp. with a hyperlink for each species to the USDA SMML database that includes host range, distribution and supporting literature.\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nA complicating factor when trying to identify Phytophthora species or investigate phylogenetic relationships is hybridization among distinct evolutionary lineages. While this does not appear to be a common occurrence, several stable hybrid species have been identified, e.g. P. andina (Goss et al. 2011; Blair et al. 2012); P. alni (Brasier et al. 1999); P. x pelgrandis (Nirenberg et al. 2009); P. x serindipita (Man in ’t Veld et al. 2012) as well as hybrid clade 1 species recovered from the field (Man in ’t Veld et al. 1998, 2007; Hurtado-Gonzales et al. 2009; Bonants et al. 2000). While conducting a detailed evaluation of clade 6 Phytophthora spp. from natural ecosystems in Australia, Burgess et al. (2010) observed ‘hybrid swarms’ that contained mixtures of parent, offspring, and intermediate isolates with high tendencies for back-crossing and out crossing. The authors’ concluded that the presence of such hybrid swarms was indicative of sexual and somatic hybridization events; the high proportion of these variant isolates within the population also suggested that these hybridization events were not uncommon. Recently four interspecific hybrid clade 6 species have been recovered from riparian ecosystems in Australia and South Africa that reflect outcrossing between P. amnicola, P. thermophila and P. taxon PgChlamydo (Nagel et al. 2013). Additional putative interspecific hybrids from riparian ecosystems in Australia were reported by Hüberli et al. (2013). Hybridization is a topic that requires a more detailed investigation as it could have a profound influence on gene flow among species and the evolution of new species with an expanded host range that could impact agricultural and natural ecosystems (as observed with P. alni).\n\nTraditional classification to species level has been based on morphological characterization of reproductive structures (reviewed in Martin et al. 2012). This includes the sporangium (asexual) and oospore (sexual) as well as the production of chlamydospores (asexual structure not produced by all species). Important features of the sporangium include their dimensions (length and breadth), shape, thickening at the terminus (papilla), length of stalk (pedicle), whether or not the sporangium can be easily dislodged from the sporangiophore (caducity), and proliferation of sporangia (internal, external or nested).\n\nThe sexual reproductive structures consist of the antheridium and oogonium (paternal and maternal gametangia, respectively) and are produced when cultures are grown on the appropriate sterol-containing medium. Their fusion leads to the formation of an oogonium that matures into a thick-walled resting structure referred to as an oospore. While most species are homothallic and form oospores in single culture, there are heterothallic species where pairing with opposite mating types is essential to stimulate production of sexual reproductive structures. Since Phytophthora is sexually dimorphic (an isolate of a heterothallic species can function either as the maternal or paternal parent depending on the isolate it is paired with) it is advisable to pair self-sterile isolates with two tester isolates of opposite mating type. While the use of tester isolates of the same species is advisable, isolates of other heterothallic species (such as P. cryptogea or P. cambivora) may also be used. Characteristics such as the diameter of the oogonium and oospore, thickness of the oospore wall, whether or not the oospore fills the oogonium (plerotic), ornamentation on the oogonial wall, and mode of attachment of the antheridium are useful for species classification.\n\nIn an effort to simplify isolate identification and establish groupings of isolates for comparison of morphological features (but not phylogenetic relationships), Waterhouse (1963) introduced the concept of morphological groups I through VI based on a number of characteristics, and is still useful today. Unfortunately a dichotomous key that includes recently described species is not available for identification of isolates but there are several recent efforts to simplify morphological identification of species, including a manual for identification of 60 species of Phytophthora by integration of a dichotomous key with a DNA fingerprinting technique based on PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) (Gallegly and Hong 2008). A LUCID key for identification of 55 common Phytophthora spp. is available (Ristaino 2011) and an expanded LUCID key including most described species should be available on a dedicated website in the near future (G. Abad and Y. Balci, personal communication). A tabular presentation of morphological features enabling comparison among 117 species may be found in Martin et al. (2012; a downloadable file of the table alone is available on the journal website).\n\nIn 1999 the number of described species in the genus Phytophthora was approximately 55 (Brasier 2007) but since then there has been a significant increase., Brasier (2007) reported a doubling in number to 105 described species, with this number recently increasing to 117 (Martin et al. 2012). Additional species have recently been described; P. lacustris (Nechwatal et al. 2012) P. pluvialis (Reeser et al. 2013), P. mississippiae (Yang et al. 2013), P. cichorii, P. dauci and P. lactucae (Bertier et al. 2013), P. pisi (Heyman et al. 2013), P. stricta and P. macilentosa (Yang et al. 2014) and the hybrid species P. x serendipita and P. x pelgrandis (Man in ’t Veld et al. 2012), bringing the total to at least 128 described species. With the number of provisional species names used in the literature, and research efforts to evaluate the distribution of this genus in natural ecosystem, this number is likely to continue to increase in the future.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nHistorically the genus Phytophthora has been placed in the Pythialeswith Pythium and related genera but more recent phylogenetic analysis with the large (LSU) or small (SSU) rDNA sequences or cox2 gene has indicated a closer affiliation with downy mildews and white rusts (Albugo.) in the Peronosporales (Beakes and Sekimoto 2009; Thines et al. 2009). However, additional multigene analyses with a larger number of downy mildew species is needed to better characterize this relationship and the placement of Phytophthora spp. in clade 9 and 10 (Blair et al. 2008). The relationship between the Peronosporales and Pythium (Pythiales) needs clarification as well. A new genus, Phytopythium, was erected to accommodate an inconsistency between taxonomic and phylogenetic grouping for certain “intermediate” Pythium species (Bala et al. 2010), and it is likely that additional taxonomic revisions of the Peronosporomycetidae will be needed to fully resolve taxonomic conflicts.\n\nEarly efforts to understand phylogenetic relationships in Phytophthora focused on the use of the nuclear encoded rDNA, primarily the ITS region (Förster et al. 2000; Cooke and Duncan 1997; Crawford et al. 1996). Cooke et al. (2000) published the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus using the ITS region to examine the phylogeny of 50 species. Most isolates grouped within eight primary clades (numbered 1 to 8) with several other species placed in two additional clades (clades 9 and 10). Kroon et al. (2004) expanded this analysis using two nuclear (translation elongation factor 1α, β-tubulin) and two mitochondrial (cox1 and nad1) genes. While in general the results were congruent with those reported by Cooke et al. (2000), there were some notable differences in the grouping of some species. Subsequent analysis by Blair et al. (2008) using seven nuclear genes (60S ribosomal protein L10, ß-tubulin, enolase, heat shock protein 90, large subunit rDNA, TigA gene fusion and translation elongation factor 1α) representing 8.1 kb of sequence data for 82 Phytophthora spp. clarified these differences. This larger, multi-marker analysis supported the observations of Cooke et al. (2000) with eight main clades plus two additional closely affiliated clades (clades 9 and 10) as the sister clades to the rest of the genus. More recently, Martin et al. (2014) expanded on this analysis by adding four mitochondrial genes (cox2, nad9, rps10 and secY) and additional species. The resulting phylogeny from this 11-marker analysis (10,828 bp per isolate) was similar to the prior observations of Blair et al. (2008) and subsequent analysis indicated that similar results could be obtained when using only five markers (LSU, β-tubulin, cox2, nad9 and rps10).\n\nWhile the ITS region may be useful for species identification (see below), length variation among species makes it impossible to construct an unambiguous alignment across the entire genus, thus hampering the utility of this marker for phylogenetic analysis. Likewise, the translation elongation factor 1α has been used for phylogenetic analysis, but recent analysis of Phytophthora genomic data indicates that the gene is duplicated; divergence among duplicates may complicate phylogenetic interpretations of species evolution (J.

Blair, unpublished).\n\nWhile the above noted phylogenetic analyses have provided insight into the broader evolutionary relationships within the genus, there is still ambiguity when examining some closely related species and species complexes. Significant progress has been made with the clarification of the P. megasperma complex and other clade six species (Brasier et al. 2003; Durán et al. 2008; Hansen et al. 2009; Jung et al. 2011a, b) but there are still several provisional species awaiting more comprehensive analysis (for example, P. taxon PgChlamydo, P. taxon raspberry, P. taxon canalensis, P. taxon erwinii, P. taxon hungarica, P. taxon oregonsis and P. taxon paludosa). While there have been advances in understanding the relationships among some clade 2 species, there is need for additional analysis to clarify species complexes such as P. citricola and P. citrophthora. One clade 8 species complex where phylogenetic resolution has been elusive is P. cryptogea and the closely related species P. drechsleri. The multigene analysis of Mostowfizadeh-Ghalamfarsa et al. (2010) confirmed that while P. drechsleri was monophyletic, the P. cryptogea complex formed three well-defined phylogenetic groups with group I closely affiliated with P. erythroseptica and group II and III as a separate clade (group III isolates have been reported as the provisional species, P. sp. kelmania; Martin et al. 2014). Some isolates were placed intermediate between groups II and III and exhibited a greater amount of heterozygosity than the other isolates, suggesting possible outcrossing between these groups. Using a parsimony-based ancestral recombination graph and genealogies inferred from the β-tubulin and translation elongation factor 1-α genes from greenhouse recovered isolates, Olson et al. (2011) suggested that divergence between P. cryptogea and P. drechsleri was recent and that speciation is still in progress.\n\nIn addition to the choice of markers to use for phylogenetic analysis, another important consideration is the type of analysis used for estimating phylogenetic relationships or for the description of new species. While traditional methods of phylogenetic analysis (maximum likelihood, neighbour-joining, Bayesian) have adequately described relationships among most species, they have been unable to fully resolve the deeper relationships among the ten Phytophthora clades or among related genera. A recent study by Martin et al. (2014) used a novel variation of a multispecies coalescent approach to evaluate the ten clades; in general support was higher than that observed in the phylogenetic analysis for the recovered relationships, but the position of certain clades (Clade 3 and the unique grouping of P. sp. ohioensis and P. quercina) remained ambiguous. Here we present an analysis using a more powerful and complex Bayesian method (Drummond et al. 2012) with five genetic markers (Fig. 20), and recover strong support for basal relationships among the clades that are quite similar to the 11-marker study of Martin et al. (2014). Newer phylogenetic methods may allow for more complex modelling of the evolutionary process, however they are still sensitive to the accuracy of a priori information provided by the user. Additional studies will be needed to provide more basic information on the tempo of molecular evolution within this group.\n\nThe description of new species is also an area were traditional phylogenetic methods may not accurately describe species relatedness. Aside from morphological characterization, recent species descriptions typically contain molecular evidence from one or a few genetic markers (primarily ITS and perhaps cox1 or 2). However, as described above, alignment ambiguity and the presence of intraspecific polymorphisms can seriously impact the recovered phylogeny; recent hybridization events and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms also violate the assumptions made by traditional phylogenetic methods. The use of coalescent-based approaches to estimate species trees from a collection of gene trees has been gaining popularity among many other taxonomic groups, but has seen little attention in Phytophthora or oomycete research in general. The recent description of P. pisi (Heyman et al. 2013) employed a multispecies coalescent approach, which confirmed the individual analyses of ITS and cox2 data. In addition, a recent study of the hybrid species P. andina (Blair et al. 2012) used several coalescent methods to determine the likely parental lineages of this species, one of which was clearly P. infestans. In the future, the use of more complex phylogenetic methods as well as coalescent-based approaches will be needed to clarify relationships at both ends of the spectrum, from deep basal nodes to recently evolved and potentially interbreeding species complexes.\n\nA common observation among all phylogenetic studies is there is no consistent correlation between phylogenetic grouping and morphological features (Cooke et al. 2000; Kroon et al. 2004, 2012; Blair et al. 2008; Martin et al. 2014). While there is some correlation with sporangial type (clade 4, 5, and 10 have primarily papillate sporangia while clade 3 has primarily semipapillate sporangia and clades 6, 7, and 9 primarily nonpapillate sporangia), other clades show combinations of these features (clade 1, 2 and 8). Characteristics such as oogonial ornamentation, heterothallism, and mode of antheridial attachment are all polyphyletic.\n\nBecause of the large number of species, intraspecific variation of some morphological features, and overlapping morphology among closely related species, traditional methods of species identification can be challenging and require some level of expertise to be effective. The use of molecular criteria has simplified this task and provides a tool for delineating distinct taxa within morphologically similar species complexes. The most accurate molecular method for species identification is sequence analysis of specific markers. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) has been widely used and a large number of sequences are currently available in public databases. However, this marker may not be ideal for the identification of all species, especially those that are closely related. For example, many clade 1C species (P. infestans, P. mirabilis) cannot be distinguished using this marker alone, nor can P. fragariae and P. rubi. More recently a portion of the cox1 gene, along with the ITS region, have been proposed as the markers to use in the Barcode of Life Database (www.boldsystems.org) and representative sequences for all described and some provisional species have been deposited (Robideau et al. 2011).\n\nSeveral nuclear (60S ribosomal protein L10, β-tubulin, enolase, heat shock protein 90, large subunit rRNA, TigA gene fusion, translation elongation factor 1α; (Blair et al. 2008; Kroon et al. 2004; Villa et al. 2006)) and mitochondrial (cox1, nad1, cox2, nad9, rps10 and secY; (Kroon et al. 2004; Martin 2008; Martin and Tooley 2003a, b; Martin et al. 2014) markers have been sequenced for phylogenetic analysis of Phytophthora and can also be used for species identification. Background information for amplification and sequencing of many of these markers, as well as the capability for BLAST searches against a curated database for isolate identification, may be found at the Phytophthora Database (www.phytophthoradb.org). A dataset for ITS and cox1 and 2 spacer sequences is also available at Phytophthora ID ((Grünwald et al. 2011), www.phytophthora-id.org) and sequence data for several markers (ITS, β-tubulin, elongation factor 1 alpha, and cox1), along with pictures of morphological features, may be found at Q-Bank (www.q-bank.eu).\n\nThere are several caveats to consider when using BLAST analysis to identify isolates to species level to prevent misidentification (Kang et al. 2010; Nilsson et al. 2012). BLAST scores are dependent on the length of the aligned sequences as well as the level of sequence identity; instances where high levels of sequence identity occur for only a portion of the target sequence may result in incorrect species identification. Also, it is common to encounter situations where scores are similar among multiple species, making it difficult to draw conclusions about an isolate’s identity (this can be especially problematic for isolates within or related to species complexes). In addition, the use of markers known to contain intraspecific polymorphisms may lead to inaccurate species identifications due to potentially lower similarities among closely related sequences. Heterozygosity in nuclear markers may also complicate identification efforts; while the presence of distinct alleles may indicate outcrossing (as Phytophthora is a known diploid), heterozygosity may also result from hybridization events between distinct lineages (as described above). Phylogenetic analysis of several markers is therefore suggested to confirm species identification, especially when working with species complexes. Additional gel based techniques, such as PCR-RFLP, SSCP, random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis, for species identification and population analysis are reviewed in Martin et al. (2012).\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nThe following genetic markers have been found to amplify well across all species and provided a similar level of phylogenetic resolution as a concatenated dataset of seven nuclear and four mitochondrial genes (Martin et al. 2014). Information on amplification and sequencing primers for these genes may be found at the Phytophthora Database (www.phytophthoradb.org).\n\nNuclear genes–LSU, β-tubulin\n\nMitochondrial–cox2, nad9, rps10\n\nPhytophthora Data\n\nSequence alignments of the seven nuclear and four mitochondrial markers used in Martin et al. (2014) and Fig. 20 may be downloaded at TreeBASE (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S14595). A table with additional information on isolates used in the analysis may be found in Martin et al. (2014) with GenBank accession numbers listed in the supplementary material of this citation. These sequences can also be downloaded from the Phytophthora Database (www.phytophthoradb.org).\n\nBackground\n\nPythium is classified as belonging to the family Pythiaceae sensu lato (s.l.), order Peronosporales s.l., class Peronosporomycetes, phylum Oomycota, and kingdom Straminipila (Beakes et al. 2014). Although many species are considered to be saprobes, the genus is known primarily for its parasitic interactions with plants. Several species also parasitize algae (green and red), fungi, other oomycetes, nematodes, insects, crustaceans, and fish. One species, P. insidiosum, is the causal agent of pythiosis in mammals, including humans (Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981; de Cock et al. 1987). Plant pathogenic Pythium species often target young below-ground plant parts such as fine roots, germinating seeds and emerging growth, resulting in damping-off, root rot and poor crop stands with stunted plants and reduced yield. Some species can also cause fruit rot, and at least one species, P. vexans, has been associated with trunk cankers of rubber trees (Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981; Zeng et al. 2005). Although some species have a limited host range, such as P. arrhenomanes that seems to be exclusively associated with gramineous crops, species like P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare and P. ultimum are known for being highly virulent on an extensive range of plant hosts (Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981). However, not all Pythium species have a negative impact on the plants they are associated with. Besides saprobes, others can benefit plants by acting as biocontrol agents that parasitize pathogenic fungi and/or induce host resistance, e.g. Pythium oligandrum (Benhamou et al. 1997). Other species of Pythium have also been reported to stimulate plant growth (Mazzola et al. 2002). Recent genome sequencing of six Pythium species found high levels of variation in the number of CRN (“Crinkler”) effectors found in the different species, possibly suggesting species-specific infection strategies (Adhikari et al. 2013) that may contribute to the range of interactions of Pythium species with their hosts. Such species-specific host-interactions along with the ubiquitous nature of the genus in soils all over the world make accurate species identification necessary to facilitate disease diagnosis and management.\n\nDebates regarding possible genera within Pythium were initially sparked by differences in sporangial morphology. Based on these characters some of the novel genera that have been proposed are Nematosporangium (for species with filamentous zoosporangia), Rheosporangium (species with lobulate zoosporangia), and Sphaerosporangium (species with ovoid, spherical or citriform sporangia) (Schröter 1897; Sparrow 1931). The legitimacies of these genera have been questioned for various reasons (Sideris 1931a; Sparrow 1932; Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981), and aside from some attempts at transferring Pythium species to Nematosporangium (Jaczewski and Jaczewski 1931; Sideris 1931b) the scientific community has stuck with the generic classification of Pythium versus these genera. As molecular taxonomy became a more popular approach to studying systematics, the paraphyletic nature of Pythium became apparent and the debate on splitting the genus was rekindled. Early sequence-based phylogenies provided strong arguments for P. vexans to be part of a separate genus (Briard et al. 1995; Cooke et al. 2000). The ITS and 28S phylogenies of Lévesque and de Cock (2004) divided Pythium into 11 clades (A-K) of which clade K (including P. vexans) is more closely related to Phytophthora than to the rest of the Pythium clades (Villa et al. 2006). A new genus, Phytopythium, was subsequently erected to include all clade K species, with Phytopythium sindhum as type species (Bala et al. 2010), although the official transfer of all clade K Pythium species to Phytopythium has not yet been published. The remaining ten clades (A-J) can be divided into two groups: species with filamentous zoosporangia (clades A-D) and species with globose zoosporangia (clades E-J) (Lévesque and de Cock 2004), calling to mind early suggestions of splitting the genus based on this character (Schröter 1893; Sparrow 1931). This division is echoed to varying degrees by phylogenies of the 28S rRNA, ITS, cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2), and β-tubulin, although the different gene trees are often incongruent and support for internal nodes low or absent (Martin 2000; Riethmüller et al. 2002; Villa et al. 2006; Hulvey et al. 2010; Robideau et al. 2011). Despite the shortcomings of these gene regions, Uzuhashi et al. (2010) used 28S and cox2 phylogenies to divide Pythium into five genera: Pythium (clades A-D), Globisporangium (clades E-G, I and J), Elongisporangium (clade H), Ovatisporangium (clade K, syn. Phytopythium), and Pilasporangium (distinct from any of the aforementioned 11 clades). Although this division is more or less in agreement with previous phylogenetic studies, it is problematic with regards to a lack of bootstrap support for the Pythium and Globisporangium clades, and the relationship and distinction between Elongisporangium and Globisporangium is not resolved with support (Fig. 21, Uzuhashi et al. 2010). Additionally, the genera Pythiogeton and Lagena seem to be phylogenetically situated within, or closely related to Pythium emend Uzuhashi, Tojo and Kakishima (Fig. 21, Huang et al. 2013a), so even this revised version of Pythium is paraphyletic. For these reasons investigators have generally been slow to adopt the proposed genera. Following this trend references to “Pythium” in this manuscript refer to Pythium s.l. (i.e. Pythium Pringsheim) unless stated otherwise.\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nA combined list of Pythium species in MycoBank (2014) and Index Fungorum (2014) includes a total of 328 names of which several are either synonyms, orthographic variants or varieties that are rarely referred to and are possibly synonyms of other species (i.e. all varieties excluding varieties of P. ultimum). Excluding such cases along with putative synonyms based on cox1 and ITS sequence homology as identified by Robideau et al. (2011) leaves more or less 230 species of Pythium. Undoubtedly this number still includes species that should be synonymized and/or transferred to genera other than Pythium (Van der Plaats-Niterink 1981; Dick 1990, 2001), but for now this should serve as a rough estimate of the number of actual Pythium species discovered to date. Of these species 152 (66 %) are known to be represented by sequence(s) in GenBank, including at least 123 (53 %) species for which type-material, ex-type strains or strains described by Van der Plaats-Niterink (1981) were used to generate sequence data (Table 19, Fig. 21).\n\nIdentification of Pythium isolates to the species level is generally straightforward when comparing both ITS and cox1 sequences to that of ex-type, authentic or other reliable representative strains. For this purpose the sequences generated by Lévesque and de Cock (2004) and Robideau et al. (2011) are excellent resources. Using only the ITS region would more often than not allow suitably accurate species identification, but some species are indistinguishable using ITS and require cox1 sequences for further identification (see Text S1A of Robideau et al. 2011). Several other species are indistinguishable even when both ITS and cox1 sequences are compared (see Text S1B of Robideau et al. 2011), and many of these should probably be formally synonymized pending more thorough investigations with multiple hypervariable genes. This approach should also resolve species complexes found in the group formed by P. irregulare, P. paroecandrum, P. cylindrosporum, P. cryptoirregulare and P. mamillatum (Barr et al. 1997; Matsumoto et al. 2000; Garzón et al. 2007; Spies et al. 2011a), the varieties of P. ultimum (Barr et al. 1996), and the P. vexans and P. cucurbitacearum group (Spies et al. 2011b). Some species epithets have been applied to multiple phylogenetic species due to imprecise species descriptions and/or misidentifications. Examples of these include P. iwayamai, P. okanoganense and P. violae (Lévesque and de Cock 2004; McLeod et al. 2009; Bahramisharif et al. 2013). Mislabelling or contamination of reference strains and/or data cause similar problems, as illustrated by the case of P. terrestre (published as “terrestris”) of which the holotype strain ITS sequence published with the description suggests phylogenetic placement in clade E (Paul 2002), while the ITS and cox1 sequences generated for the ex-type strain available from the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) suggests phylogenetic placement in clade F (Robideau et al. 2011). Species identification within genetically diverse species complexes (see Text S1C of Robideau et al. 2011 for a partial list) can also be tricky, more due to uncertain species boundaries than due to the ineffectiveness of ITS and/or cox1 as barcoding regions. The onus is on the investigator to keep such issues in mind when identifying strains to the species level and to consider the identification in context of the taxonomic history of the species and its closest relatives.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nThe first molecular phylogenies of Pythium were inferred from sequences of the 28S, ITS, and cox2 regions respectively, and although each analysis included only a few species, the observed variation merited speculation regarding the polyphyletic nature of Pythium at least for the ITS and 28S phylogenies (Briard et al. 1995; Cooke et al. 2000; Martin 2000). The first study to provide an extensive DNA sequence based phylogeny of Pythium was that of Lévesque and de Cock (2004) who sequenced the 28S region of 51 species and complete ITS region (ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2) region of 116 species. Although a two-marker phylogeny of the ITS-28S region was presented by Lévesque and de Cock (2004), these markers are adjacent multi-copy markers that might not accurately represent the evolutionary relationships in Pythium. Villa et al. (2006) used multiple markers (ITS, cox2, β-tubulin) in individual phylogenetic analyses with 39 species and confirmed previous suggestions of an intermediate evolutionary position of clade K species between Pythium and Phytophthora, but also suggested that clade H species (represented by Phytophthora undulata ≡ Pythium undulatum) occupy a similar intermediate position, which contrasted the position of this clade nestled among clades E, F, G, I, and J as suggested by Lévesque and de Cock (2004). The multi-marker phylogeny (18S-ITS-28S, cox2 and β-tubulin) of 152 Pythium species and some related taxa presented here confirms the association of clade K with Phytophthora, but fails to provide support for the evolutionary association of clade H with any of the other recognized groups within Pythium (Fig. 21). Furthermore, organisms such as the obligate root pathogen Lagena radicicola and strains resembling Lagenidium form an unresolved cluster of taxa related to clade C (Fig. 21). In itself this phylogenetic placement of the genus Lagena necessitates a further taxonomic revision of the genus Pythium that can only be achieved once the internal nodes of the Pythium phylogeny have been resolved with support. Despite the fact that the phylogeny in Fig. 21 represents the most extensive sampling of taxa and genetic markers in a multi-marker phylogeny of Pythium to date, it still fails to achieve this goal. Phylogenetic markers additional or alternative to those currently used in Pythium systematics are needed to resolve these issues and elucidate taxon boundaries.\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nThe 18S (small subunit, SSU) and 28S (large subunit, LSU) nuclear rRNA genes–generic level phylogenies within Pythium s.l.\n\nThe internal transcribed spacers (ITS including ITS1, 5.8S rRNA, and ITS2), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2)–sub-generic, inter- and intra-specific level phylogenies\n\nITS and cox1–non-phylogenetic species identification\n\nMitochondrial regions such as cox1 and cox2 should be used with consideration of the fact that they mainly reflect evolution of maternal lineages and can produce incongruent phylogenies. This is especially true for cox1, which is why this region was not included in Fig. 21. The β-tubulin region has also been used to a limited extent in Pythium phylogenies (Villa et al. 2006; Belbahri et al. 2008; Spies et al. 2011a, b). Although this region fails to resolve Pythium into the genera observed when using the dataset from Fig. 21 (data not shown) and has limited power in resolving species-level phylogenies (Spies et al. 2011a, b), it amplifies and sequences well for most Pythium species and is an easy resource for use in concatenated datasets (e.g. Bahramisharif et al. 2013; Fig. 21).\n\nBackground\n\nPuccinia is the type genus of the family Pucciniaceae in the order of rust fungi, Pucciniales (Basidiomycota). Puccinia has approximately 4,000 named species (Kirk et al. 2008), and is a widespread genus of plant pathogens that has shaped history. For example, Puccinia graminis, the type species of Puccinia, was investigated as a biological warfare agent in the cold war (Line and Griffith 2001). It was the impetus for breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease that started the Green Revolution, lead by 1970 Nobel Laureate, Norman Borlaug (Zeyen et al. 2014). Epidemics of stem rust of wheat caused by P. graminis remain a threat with the emergence of races such as Ug99 (Singh et al. 2011). Other species of Puccinia are also serious pathogens of grasses (Poaceae), including P. coronata and P. striiformis (Kirk et al. 2008). Rusts of Asteraceae, e.g., P. helianthi, and rusts of Fabaceae in the closely related genus Uromyces, e.g., U. viciae-fabae, U. appendiculatus and U. ciceris-arietini, are important pathogens of cultivated fodder and food crops.\n\nAmong the ca. 120 to 160 genera of rust fungi (Cummins and Hiratsuka 2003; Kirk et al. 2008), Puccinia is readily recognized by the two-celled teliospores and the shape of the spermogonia (Cummins and Hiratsuka 2003). Uromyces with one-celled teliospores is typically differentiated from Puccinia, although some species of Puccinia have both one-celled (mesospores) and two-celled teliospores, e.g., P. lagenophorae. Teliospore morphology is homoplasious, and Puccinia and Uromyces were polyphyletic in systematic studies based on the LSU and SSU regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (Maier et al. 2007; Aime 2006), and the two nuclear genes: elongation factor and β- tubulin (Van der Merwe et al. 2007). Some rust fungi have teliospores morphologically similar to Puccinia, but are not closely related or have an uncertain systematic position. For example, Allodus podophylli has two-celled teliospores convergent with Puccinia. A systematic analysis based on the nLSU and nSSU regions of rDNA determined Allodus and Puccinia were unrelated (Minnis et al. 2012). Puccinia psidii, which spread from South America to much of the Pacific region and South Africa, now infects 30 genera of Myrtaceae out of its natural host range (Pegg et al. 2013). It has two-celled teliospores, but its placement within the Pucciniales is unknown. Phylogenetic analyses of the nLSU and nSSU (Pegg et al. 2013) and the protein coding gene beta-tubulin (Van Der Merwe et al. 2008) indicated that P. psidii was sister to the Pucciniaceae. Several families and genera of rust fungi are polyphyletic, namely the Raveneliaceae, Phakopsoraceae and Pucciniaceae. These polyphyletic families and genera await resolution by molecular phylogenetic analyses.\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nRust fungi are usually considered host specific (Cummins and Hiratsuka 2003), although some, e.g., Puccinia psidii and P. lagenophorae, infect multiple host genera (McTaggart et al. 2014; Pegg et al. 2013). Some species of rust fungi are heteroecious, requiring two hosts in different families to complete their life cycle, e.g., P. graminis on Triticum (Poaceae) and Berberis (Berberidaceae).\n\nRust fungi have a complicated life cycle with up to five spore states (Cummins and Hiratsuka 2003). Consequently, up to three names have been proposed for the same taxon based on different life cycle stages. To add to the confusion, there are two systems of terminology that describe these spore states, one based on morphology (Laundon 1967), and the other on ontogeny (Arthur and Kern 1926; Cummins and Hiratsuka 2003; Hiratsuka 1973). These systems of terminology were summarised by Hennen and Hennen (2000).\n\nSpecies of rust fungi are often identified on the basis of their host specificity, and monographs were organised by plant family (Sydow and Sydow 1904; McAlpine 1906; Cummins 1971, 1978). Morphological characters of the teliospores and urediniospores, such as size, apex shape and wall thickness, ornamentation, and germ pore position and number, are useful for species identification.\n\nMolecular diagnostic tools have been developed for some species of Puccinia based on the ITS region of rDNA, e.g., P. coronata (Beirn et al. 2011; Pfunder et al. 2001), P. kuehnii (Glynn et al. 2010) and P. psidii (Langrell et al. 2008). The ITS region has successfully distinguished phylogenetic species in Uromyces (Barilli et al. 2011) and it was used in combination with TEF to resolve the taxonomy of P. melampodii (Seier et al. 2009). However, the ITS region was polymorphic in Puccinia lagenophorae (Littlefield et al. 2005; Scholler et al. 2011), and Morin et al. (2009) discovered a paralagous copy of the ITS region, which may have resulted from a hybridization event. A paralagous copy of the ITS region was also reported in P. kuehnii in the study by Virtudazo et al. (2001). Polymorphisms and paralogous copies are caveats for studies based on the ITS region in rust fungi.\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nLarge-scale systematic studies of rust fungi have focused mainly on the SSU and LSU regions of rDNA (Aime 2006; Beenken et al. 2012; Dixon et al. 2010; Maier et al. 2003, 2007; Minnis et al. 2012; Wingfield et al. 2004; Yun et al. 2011) (Table 21). Protein coding genes such as beta-tubulin (Morin et al. 2009; Van der Merwe et al. 2007, 2008) and elongation factor (TEF) (Seier et al. 2009; Van der Merwe et al. 2007) were successfully used at the family, genus and species level in rust fungi, although beta-tubulin required cloning rather than direct sequencing of PCR product. Liu et al. (2013) included ITS, beta-tubulin, ribosomal polymerase subunit 2 (RPB2) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) in a systematic study to resolve the P. coronata species complex. They discussed the difficulty of PCR amplification of older herbarium specimens, and that DNA repair was successful in some cases. Vialle et al. (2009) compared mitochondrial genes to rDNA markers in two genera of rusts, Chrysomyxa and Melampsora. They found rDNA had better species resolution than mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial genes were since used in studies of the genera Chrysomyxa (Feau et al. 2011) and Dasyspora (Beenken et al. 2012), but have not yet been used for Puccinia.\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nThe large subunit of nrDNA (LSU)–is useful for genus and species level identification of all rust fungi\n\nThe internal transcribed spacer (ITS)–is useful for species level identification, but may contain polymorphic sites and paralagous copies. Rust specific primers are recommended.\n\nRusts are obligate biotrophs and difficult to maintain in pure culture, which has posed a challenge for DNA extraction (Aime 2006). This is reflected by the relatively few species of Puccinia represented in GenBank, for example, there are ~110 species of Puccinia represented by the ITS and LSU regions of rDNA. This is less than 3 % of the estimated 4,000 species of Puccinia (Kirk et al. 2008). Reliance on molecular identification for some species of Puccinia is not recommended. For example, McTaggart et al. (2014) determined that several species of Puccinia on different plant families in Australia had near-identical ITS and LSU rDNA sequences (Fig. 23 Puccinia).\n\nBackground\n\nVerticillium belongs in the family Plectosphaerellaceae of the Ascomycota. Verticillium species are soilborne, vascular, fungal plant pathogens that cause Verticillium wilt disease in many important agricultural crops throughout the world (Pegg and Brady 2002). Based on susceptibility, 410 plant species that include nearly 80 plant genera have been recorded as being infected by Verticillium species (Pegg and Brady 2002). Correct species identification is important for determining the ecological roles of Verticillium species and for diagnosing disease. Sexual stages have not been identified for Verticillium species although mating type idiomorphs MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 have been identified in separate isolates of V. dahliae, V. albo-atrum, V. longisporum, V. alfalfa and V. nonalfalfae, indicating that these species are potentially heterothallic (Inderbitzin et al. 2011a, b; Usami et al. 2009).\n\nSpecies identification and numbers\n\nThe genus Verticillium sensu stricto refers to a monophyletic group of plant pathogens comprising V. dahliae as the type of Verticillium (Gams et al. 2005). The genus can be identified based on its distinct ‘verticillate conidiophores’ with flask-shaped conidiophores arranged in whorls attached along a main axis that comprise the spore forming cells (Pegg and Brady 2002). The genus Verticillium has a long taxonomic history and approximately 190 species were originally classified by Zare et al. (2004). Recently Inderbitzin et al. (2011a) used four-marker phylogenetic analysis to identify ten Verticillium species.\n\nEarlier studies identified Verticillium species primarily on the basis of morphology and sub-specific groups by virulence and aggressiveness on various hosts (Rowe 1995). Variation in conidial morphology of Verticillium species is minor and thus cannot be used to separate species (Rowe 1995). Resting structure morphology has been the major morphological character used to differentiate species of Verticillium.\n\nVerticillium albo-atrum and V. dahliae are the most important plant pathogenic species. Verticillium albo-atrum was first described in Germany, 1879, by Reinke and Berthold as the causal agent of potato wilt. The resting structures identified from the diseased plant tissue were brown-pigmented hyphae which were described as ‘Dauermycelien’. Later this pigmented hyphae was termed dark ‘resting mycelium’ which had only transverse walls and no lateral budding (Isaac 1949). No microsclerotia were produced by V. albo-atrum.\n\nVerticillium dahliae was first isolated by Klebahn in 1913 from wilting Dahlia. The isolate produces smaller and oval to elongate microsclerotia as a resting structure from budding hyphae, but not dark resting mycelium (Smith 1965). Verticillium tricorpus forms large and irregular microsclerotia with melanised hyphae and chlamydospores (hence the prefix “tri”). Moreover, V. tricorpus often produces yellow colonies on PDA upon first isolation (Goud et al. 2003). Verticillium nubilum produces only rounded to elongate chlamydospores, individually or in chains (Inderbitzin et al. 2011a). Verticillium longisporum refers to the species proposed by Karapapa et al. (1997) that infected hosts in the family Brassicaceae. Isolates of this species produce microsclerotia which are rounded to elongate with relatively long conidia, and nearly double the nuclear DNA content (Inderbitzin et al. 2011a).\n\nMolecular techniques have been used in the characterisation and identification of Verticillium species for both species identification and phylogenetic comparisons (Collins et al. 2003; Collado-Romero et al. 2008). Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, Typas et al. (1992) reported that mitochondrial DNA of Verticillium species were distinctive and easily differentiated V. albo-atrum (from alfalfa) from other V. albo-atrum isolates. Carder and Barbara (1991) used RFLP analysis to differentiate V. dahliae from all isolates of V. albo-atrum and found intraspecific variation within V. dahliae isolates. Subsequently, Okoli et al. (1993) probed Southern blots derived from 17 isolates of V. dahliae with 71 random genomic clones from V. dahliae and found that 15 isolates fitted clearly into two RFLP groups designated A and B. Although these groups correlated with isozyme patterns they did not show any correlation with host plant or geographic origin. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers clearly differentiated 15 V. albo-atrum potato isolates from 20 alfalfa V. albo-atrum isolates and found that these two groups were genetically distinct (Barasubiye et al. 1995). Komatsu et al. (2001) used repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) and RAPD markers to show that V. dahliae isolates from potato were similar in genetic background, regardless of geographic origin.\n\nIn North America, characterization of vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs have the ability to undergo hyphal anastomosis with other isolates) using molecular markers confirmed that VCG 4A isolates of V. dahliae were more highly virulent than VCG 4B isolates (Dobinson et al. 2000). Molecular characterization of VCGs has been determined in many other crops (Collado-Romero et al. 2006, 2009; Dobinson et al. 1998).\n\nMolecular phylogeny\n\nNazar et al. (1991) found only five nucleotide differences between V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum on the basis of the non-conserved ITS region (ITS 1 and ITS 2) of rDNA. Robb et al. (1993) reported 17 nucleotide differences between V. dahliae and V. tricorpus and 12 between V. albo-atrum and V. tricorpus (Moukhamedov et al. 1994). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (rDNA) and the β-tubulin gene showed distinct groups comprising isolates of V. albo-atrum, V. tricorpus, and V. dahliae from cruciferous and noncruciferous hosts (Qin et al. 2006).\n\nFahleson et al. (2004) studied three different markers (mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cob), the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA gene (rns) and the nuclear ITS2 region) sequences from five plant pathogenic isolates of Verticillium and found five monophyletic groups corresponding to the Verticillium species. In addition, V. tricorpus displayed a closer relationship to V. albo-atrum, V. dahliae and V. longisporum. But V. nigrescens was distantly related to the other species. Based on nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU) and ITS sequences, Zare et al. (2007) proposed Gibellulopsis as a genus to accommodate V. nigrescens.\n\nRecent molecular phylogenetic studies by Inderbitzin et al. (2011a) using four gene sequences viz actin, elongation factor 1-alpha, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and tryptophan synthase, divided Verticillium into two separate groups, corresponding to the production of yellow pigment in culture (clade Flavexudans), or the lack of yellow pigment (clade Flavnonexudans). The species Verticillium albo-atrum, V. tricorpus, V. zaregamsianum, V. isaacii and V. klebahnii were placed in the Flavexudans clade of which the latter two species were morphologically indistinguishable from V. tricorpus. The species Verticillium dahliae, V. nubilum, V. longisporum, V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae were placed in the clade Flavnonexudans (Inderbitzin et al. 2011a). Interestingly, V. longisporum which is a diploid hybrid had alleles in different clades including the V. dahliae clade thus reflecting the ancestral origin of the hybrid. According to Inderbitzin et al. (2011b), each V. longisporum isolate contained two alleles at each locus with allele A1 being present in all isolates in addition to alleles D1, D2 or D3. Therefore, according to Inderbitzin et al. (2011a), V. longisporum should remain a polyphyletic species.\n\nThe phylogenetic tree of the ten species adopted by Inderbitzin et al. (2011a) did not include the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region ITS, because V. longisporum isolates only had one ITS allele consistent with all other Verticillium species and hence this gene sequence could not retrace the evolution of the species (Inderbitzin et al. 2011b). Nevertheless, neither the four gene phylogenetic analysis nor the single ITS phylogenetic tree were able to differentiate V. longisporum alleles D2 and D3 from V. dahliae (Inderbitzin et al. 2011b).\n\nIn contrast to the above results, a four gene phylogenetic tree composed of only the type isolates (Fig. 27) failed to differentiate V. isaacii from V. klebahnii; while V. alfalfa was identical to V. nonalfalfae; and V. dahliae was identical to V. longisporum allele D2. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic tree based only on ITS (Fig. 28) provided better discrimination to differentiate V. isaacii from V. klebahnii, and V. alfalfa from V. nonalfalfae, albeit with weak bootstrap supports.\n\nAnother anomaly with the four gene phylogenetic tree based on only type isolates was that V. nubilum claded with the yellow pigment forming Flavexudans species whereas in the tree by Inderbitzin et al. (2011a), V. nubilum claded with the Flavnonexudans species. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic tree based only on ITS (Fig. 28) placed V. nubilum in the Flavnonexudans species group. In fact V. nubilum does not produce yellow pigment in culture, such that it is better placed in the Flavnonexudans species group.\n\nRecommended genetic markers\n\nMost of the ten Verticillium species can be identified using the ITS sequences of the type isolates (Table 25, Fig. 28) however, strong bootstrap support is provided for most clades using four gene sequences (Table 25, Fig. 27).\n\nInternal transcribed spacer (ITS)–species level\n\nActin (ACT)–generic/species level\n\nElongation factor 1-alpha (EF)–generic/ species level\n\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD)–generic/ species level\n\nTryptophan synthase (TS)–generic/ species level\n\nThe present effort is far from exhaustive, and the selection of fungal lineages reflects the backgrounds of the authors rather than degree of pathogenicity or economic impact of the underlying fungi. Indeed, several of the groups covered are pathogens on plants that are used neither in agriculture nor forestry. Furthermore, the fact that a group is addressed in the present study should not be taken to mean that no further discoveries or insights in the group are likely to emerge; the opposite is certain to be true for all of the groups studied here. Knowledge of phytopathogenic fungi accumulates at a high pace, and we hope that the readers will use this study as a starting point in their pursuit. Towards that end, we aim to maintain rich, updated backbone trees of as many groups of plant pathogenic fungi as we can. These will be published as a joint paper on an annual or biennial basis as new data are produced. Researchers who can cover any group not presently covered–or improve on any of the groups that are covered already–are warmly invited to take part in this effort by contacting the corresponding author.\n\nAs one of the pursuits of this effort, we have attempted to address the question of which genes and genetic markers that will provide the highest phylogenetic/taxonomic resolution in various groups of plant pathogenic fungi. These differ markedly among groups. At the same time, for someone examining a sample of an unknown phytopathology-related fungus, the choice of initial genetic markers is easy. The ITS region–the formal fungal barcode–is the most commonly sequenced marker in mycology, such that a rich array of reference sequences is available. Although the ITS region will not always provide resolution at the species level, it will nearly always provide enough resolution to support assignment of the species to at least the level of subgenus/species complex. This information is likely to be enough for many applications; for others, it makes it much easier to make an informed choice of what genes to sequence next. However, researchers sometimes recover fungal ITS sequences that are not easily fitted into the corpus of reference ITS sequences. The next most sequenced marker in mycology is the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nLSU; Begerow et al. 2010), which is significantly more conserved than the ITS region and offers resolution at the genus to order level. The nLSU is something of the mainstay of large-scale phylogenetic inference in fungi (Blackwell et al. 2006), and nearly all fungal nLSU sequences can be assigned to at least the ordinal level. For unknown samples, we thus advice researchers to sequence the ITS and nLSU regions as a first step.\n\nFungal plant pathogens attract the attention of numerous scientific and applied fields, including mycology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, silviculture, and medicine. In many cases this attention will centre on establishing, or ruling out, a pathogenic nature of specific fungal samples; and in many cases, such efforts will be based on molecular data. Molecular identification of fungi–DNA barcoding–has a long and rich history but was only recently formalized (Bruns et al. 1990; Schoch et al. 2012). Indeed, many parts of its realization still loom on the horizon. For instance, central barcoding resources and databases of wide acceptance in the mycological community are largely lacking. Most researchers, when processing newly generated fungal sequences, turn to GenBank (Benson et al. 2014) for sequence identification. Many entries in GenBank suffer from technical complications or low-resolution annotations, but efforts to standardize and improve on the data and level of metadata given are under way (Nilsson et al. 2014; Schoch et al. 2014). The largest database focusing on the formal fungal barcoding region–ITS–is UNITE (Kõljalg et al. 2013). Sharing data with GenBank, UNITE serves as the provider of reference fungal ITS datasets for a long range of applications and downstream uses. The results of the present effort–in particular, the sequences from type material–are being implemented in UNITE for all its diverse uses and for subsequent distribution to GenBank. We hope that this will lead to increased scientific resolution for researchers recovering any of the fungal lineages treated in this study.\n\nThe heterogeneous user base of data pertaining to phytopathogenic fungi suggests that many users of data pertaining to phytopathogenic fungi will not be–and cannot expected to be–up to date on recent developments in mycology, systematics, or the use of molecular data in biology. It is thus largely up to mycologists to provide the scientific community with as accurate and easily interpreted information on fungi and phytopathological fungal species as possible. The mycological community lives up to that expectation with various degrees of success. Improvement is particularly needed in the public sequence databases, where many researchers routinely submit phytopathologically relevant fungal sequences without any notion of taxonomic affiliation, host association, or country of collection (notably “Uncultured fungus”). Such sequences will be excluded from, or treated only superficially in, most research efforts and sequence comparisons, leading to reduced scientific resolution and explanatory power. We urge mycologists with a phytopathological inclination–indeed, with any inclination–to set good examples in this regard by providing rich, reliable annotations for their sequences. Guidelines on how to establish the integrity and improve the wide usefulness of fungal sequence data are readily available for consideration (Nilsson et al. 2012; Hyde et al. 2013a, b; Schoch et al. 2014). We similarly hope that all mycologists, when describing new species, will make it a habit to bundle at least one DNA sequence–starting with the ITS region–with the description (cf. Seifert and Rossman 2010). This will help others to interpret the name and will go a long way to make it available to the general scientific audience. Enclosing molecular data with species descriptions is not required by the current nomenclatural code governing fungi (McNeill et al. 2012), but we feel that this is a good opportunity for mycology to show its progressive nature. In a time where mycology finds it increasingly hard to compete for funding with disciplines deemed more cutting-edge, mycologists should make every effort to propagate their results and findings to the widest audience possible."
