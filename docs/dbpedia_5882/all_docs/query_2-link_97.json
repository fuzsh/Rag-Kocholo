        "text": "Species of Ophiognomonia are leaf-inhabiting endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes that infect plants in the families Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Lauraceae, Malvaceae, Platanaceae, Rosaceae, Salicaceae, and Sapindaceae. Based on extensive collecting, this speciesrich genus is now known to have a world wide distribution in primarily temperate areas, although some species are known from the subtropics. Analyses of DNA sequences from three markers including guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-like protein (MS204), translation elongation factor 1α (tef-1α), and the ITS region including ITS1, 5.8 S rDNA and ITS2 regions (ITS) were used to define phylogenetic species in Ophiognomonia. Host plant association correlated with these species. Twenty-five new species of Ophiognomonia and two new combinations are proposed with descriptions and illustrations. In addition, descriptions and illustrations are provided for 12 other species of Ophiognomonia. A key is provided to the 45 currently accepted species of Ophiognomonia. The disposition of additional names in Ophiognomonia is also discussed."
