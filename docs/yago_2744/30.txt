She was married to late screen icon Burt Reynolds for five years before being tied up in one of Hollywood's messiest divorces.

But with all of that drama firmly in the past, Loni Anderson, who spoke at the actor's memorial in September, enjoyed dinner out at Craig's in West Hollywood on Monday night, showing off her timeless golden girl good looks.

The 73-year-old actress wore an elegant evening look showing off a bit of leg in a black lace dress and sheer tights.

The blonde beauty - who has been married to folk singer Bob Flick since 2008 - was seen with a male companion who escorted her out of the restaurant.

Loni's tresses were styled into bouncy waves and she wore a neutral makeup look with glossy lips and bronze eye shadow.

The actress attended Reynolds' funeral in September along with Quinton, 30, the son she shares with the late actor.

The memorial for Reynolds, who died at age 82 on September 6 at a hospital in Jupiter, Florida, was held at Quattlebaum Funeral Home in North Palm Beach, Florida.

Loni, who had a notoriously difficult divorce from Reynolds, shared happier moments from their 12 years together, calling their son Quinton their 'greatest collaboration.'

She was Reynolds' second wife and he her third husband. The pair were married from 1988 until 1994.

Quinton, whom the couple adopted together the year they married, is Reynolds' only child.

Loni has a daughter, Deidra Hoffman, 53, with first husband Bruce Hasselberg.

Prior to his relationship with Loni, Reynolds was married to the English comic actress Judy Carne from 1963 until 1965. He also famously carried on a relationship with Sally Field during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
