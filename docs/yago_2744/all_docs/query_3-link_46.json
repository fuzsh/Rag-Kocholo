        "meta_description": "Burt Reynolds. Actor: Boogie Nights. Enduring, strong-featured, and genial star of US cinema, Burt Reynolds started off in T.V. westerns in the 1960s and then carved his name into 1970s/1980s popular culture, as a sex symbol (posing nearly naked for \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine), and on-screen as both a rugged action figure and then as a wisecracking, Southern type of \"good ol' boy.\"\n\nBurton Leon Reynolds was born in Lansing, Michigan. He was...",

        "text": "Had a relationship with Sally Field for many years, but she refused his numerous proposals, and they eventually broke up. He said that she was a positive influence on him and, in fact, was the love of his life.\n\nMet one of his heroes, Spencer Tracy, while filming Riverboat (1959). Tracy was filming Wer den Wind s채t (1960) on the same lot and Reynolds used to watch him walk from the set to his trailer everyday. After a while, Tracy finally turned to him and said, \"Come on, kid.\" For the next several weeks the two would meet and talk about sports and, every once in a while, acting.\n\nAttended Elizabeth Taylor's \"Commitment to Life\" fund-raiser for AIDS research on 19 September 1985, where Burt Lancaster read Rock Hudson's statement announcing he had been diagnosed with AIDS. At one point Reynolds was booed when he read a telegram of support from President Ronald Reagan. Reynolds summed up the frustration of the lack of AIDS awareness when he angrily said, \"If this were a benefit for cancer, reporters wouldn't be asking stupid questions like, 'Why are you here?'.\".\n\nWas the first actor ever asked to guest-host The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962). Prior to Reynolds, only comedians had been invited. His first (?) guest was his ex-wife Judy Carne, who he hadn't spoken to in over six years after a very bitter divorce.\n\nSales of the Pontiac TransAm increased by 500% after Ein ausgekochtes Schlitzohr (1977). Pontiac was so grateful to Reynolds that it promised him a new TransAm every year in perpetuity. The promise lasted five years. He drove a 1977 Trans Am Limited Edition in these movies.\n\nWas the original choice to play Garrett Breedlove in Zeit der Z채rtlichkeit (1983). Although he loved the script, he had already agreed to star in Der rasende Gockel (1983), so he turned down the role. As a result, the role went to Jack Nicholson, who eventually won an Oscar for it. Reynolds later commented that this was one of his most terrible mistakes.\n\nWas director Milos Forman's first choice for the lead in Einer flog 체ber das Kuckucksnest (1975) but United Artists believed his appeal with average moviegoers might prevent the film from attracting the critical attention it felt was necessary for the film to be a box-office hit. Jack Nicholson was cast instead and him his first Best Actor Oscar. Eight years later Reynolds was writer-director James L. Brooks' first choice for the role of amorous astronaut Garrett Breedlove in Zeit der Z채rtlichkeit (1983). This time Reynolds passed on the project, clearing the way for Nicholson to win his second Oscar, this one for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nHad no plans to retire in his last years, despite having difficulty walking, due to breaking over forty bones when doing his own stunts early in his career. Reynolds' money problems after his second divorce clouded the last 25 years of his life.\n\nIn May 2018, he joined the cast for Quentin Tarantino's film Once Upon a Time In... Hollywood (2019) as George Spahn, but he died before shooting his scenes. Bruce Dern was cast instead. When Rick and Cliff are watching All the Streets Are Silent (1965), the actor who played the Rick Dalton role in the actual TV episode was Burt Reynolds.\n\nDespite his lucrative career, in 1996 he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, due in part to an extravagant lifestyle, a divorce from Loni Anderson and failed investments in some Florida restaurant chains. He emerged from bankruptcy two years later.\n\nHis working relationship with Paul Thomas Anderson during the making of Boogie Nights (1997) was very difficult and he hated the film so much that he fired his agent immediately after viewing a screening. This was before the critical raves after the New York Film Festival occurred. He was then convinced by Anderson to promote the film on a radio tour and was further enraged at Anderson's behavior (constantly not letting Reynolds speak). This was the final straw for Reynolds, who, after a week or so of promoting the film, tried to punch Anderson in the face and stopped promoting the film. Reynolds refused to participate in Anderson's next project, Magnolia (1999).\n\nIn 1999 one of the projects that never realized for him was \"Bulls Night Out\". The movie was supposed to be an old-fashioned cop drama about over-the-hill cops taking justice into their own hands. It was to be directed by Burt himself, and to star him and a number of other veteran action stars. Roy Scheider, Danny Aiello, Louis Gossett Jr. and Charles Durning were all attached. It was supposed to be funded by a then new studio called Ray Art Studios, based in Canoga Park, CA. For a variety of reasons, the film never got made.\n\nDuring the mid-'80s he tried to make a comeback with Heat - Nick, der Killer (1986), written by William Goldman. He hoped the movie, directed by Robert Altman, would mark a new phase in his career. Unfortunately, Altman had an altercation with producer Elliott Kastner and left the project. The movie ended up being a box-office failure.\n\nWhen Francis Ford Coppola decided to make a project about the life of the famous Preston Tucker, he wanted Reynolds to play Tucker. They had many discussions about the movie and made plans, but the film did not get made until 1988, this time with Jeff Bridges in the role. Reynolds only got Lewis Medlock's role in Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972) after the stars who were originally chosen to play the lead--including Marlon Brando, Henry Fonda and James Stewart--declined the part, after they heard about the risks of the Chattooga River.\n\nIronically, while Reynolds was nominated for a \"Best Motion Picture Actor - Musical or Comedy\" Golden Globe for his performance as \"Paul Crewe\" in Die Kampfmaschine (1974), he was nominated for a Razzie Award for \"Worst Supporting Actor\" for his performance in the 2005 remake (Spiel ohne Regeln (2005)). Here, he played \"Coach Scarboro\" to Adam Sandler's \"Paul Crewe\".\n\nHe was offered the role of Edward Lewis in Pretty Woman (1990) but declined. He jokingly said on Piers Morgan's Life Stories (2009) in 2012 that after he saw the film and the love-making scenes with Julia Roberts, that he made a mistake in not taking the part.\n\nThe character design of the Comedian/Edward Blake in Alan Moore's graphic novel \"Watchmen\" is said to have been based on Reynolds. He was even considered for the role when the novel was in discussion to be adapted to film.\n\nHis 1972 nude centerfold photo in Cosmopolitan magazine sold 1.5 million copies. He later said that he deeply regretted posing for the photo, as he believed it lost him an Academy Award nomination for Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972), as he would not be seen as a 'serious actor'. A depiction of the photo was also used in the film poster for Auf leisen Sohlen kommt der Tod (1972), also starring Reynolds.\n\nAfter having worked with director John Boorman in Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972), he was cast by Boorman one year later to play the lead in the science-fiction Zardoz (1974). Reynolds had to pull out due to illness and Sean Connery got the part. Reynolds and Boorman almost worked together again, this time in 1980, when Boorman was attached, for some time, to direct him in Sharky und seine Profis (1981). When Boorman left the picture, Reynolds directed it himself.\n\nLost the 1997 Razzie award for Worst Supporting Actor to Marlon Brando by a mere single vote. Reynolds was nominated for his performance in Striptease (1996) and Brando for his role in D.N.A. - Experiment des Wahnsinns (1996). The vote was cast by Razzie awards founder John Wilson, who always chooses to vote last.\n\nHe was offered a lead role in M*A*S*H (1970), but turned it down after \"they told me the other two leads would be Barbra Streisand's husband and that tall, skinny guy who was in Das dreckige Dutzend (1967).\" Tom Skerritt played the role instead.\n\nWas named the #1 top money-making star at the box office in Quigley Publications' annual poll of movie exhibitors for five consecutive years from 1978-82, equaling the record set by Bing Crosby from 1944-48. Only Tom Cruise, who was named #1 six times between 1986 and 2001, has won more box-office crowns. Both Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks also have been #1 five times, but non-consecutively."
