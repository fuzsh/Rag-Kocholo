        "text": "Does anyone know what happened to her? Anyone ever met her or worked with her? I just loved her when I was a gayling, and was jealous of all the attention she received from men.\n\nHave a friend who worked with Burt Reynolds when they were married. Seemed like a shit show. She was super jealous. And apparently naive about his gayness. Not the brightest bulb. But she was gorgeous. The Burt/Loni relationship deserves its own DL thread.\n\nBurt Reynolds said that marrying her was the worst mistake of his life. I believe that. She spent his money like water. They adopted a child; why the hell did they do that? I think in her case it was a good idea; having a child made some kind of loophole in their prenup that allowed her to screw him out of more money. I think at the time of his death she was still suing him for money. She's a horror story.\n\nIt’s not her fault she spent all of Burt’s money. It was the fabulous 80s, where flagrant displays of wealth were all the rage. Flashy cars, jewelry, furs, and opulence! I loved the “Dynasty” decade. I would have spent all of his money too.\n\nVintage gossip: “Anderson, Loni. Failed marriage to and bitter divorce with Burt Reynolds; held her adopted son hostage in the divorce. Bi_____; linked with Carol Burnett.“\n\nPersonally, I think she had a mediocre/cute face. But her body was smokin’, so I guess that made her seem more attractive. Apparently you just have to have bleached blonde hair and gigantic boobs and men are powerless.\n\nThey held up my plane coming back to LA from Honolulu with their first class shenanigans. Boarded last, late, we all hate to wait for them to board and their VIP treatment of luggage. She was beautiful. His plastic surgery didn't look good. This was in 1992.\n\n[quote]Burt Reynolds said that marrying her was the worst mistake of his life. I believe that. She spent his money like water\n\nAccording to Loni's friends, Burt was cheating on her for pretty much the whole relationship. Supposedly, he even had his girlfriend sitting in one of the pews at their wedding! Loni also stood by him and took care of him throughout the jaw ordeal when he was homebound and newspapers were reporting that he was dying of AIDS. I don't think a career savvy, money hungry woman would do something like that.\n\nNo, R19. In fact, Loni was so dark (and her pre-surgery features were so different) when she was a teen that there have long been rumors that she's mixed race.\n\nPersonally, I think she was prettier when she was young and natural. But America wants blondes with tiny noses, and they shall have them.\n\n\"I don't think a career savvy, money hungry woman would do something like that.\"\n\nThat's exactly what a career savvy, money hungry woman WOULD do, hold on to her meal ticket and convince him of her undying devotion to him. Brigitte Nielsen did the same thing with Sylvester Stallone. He had some kind of illness and he said she stayed in the hospital with him, sleeping in a cot next to his bed. It convinced him of her selflessness and devotion. What a sucker.\n\nR21 Yes, but this was 84, 85 and AIDS was not just some kind of random illness. Look a the shitstorm Rock Hudson caused, and how people reacted.\n\nA lot of people who Burt considered friends distanced themselves from him during that period even though he didn't actually have it. Just the AIDS rumors alone could do tremendous damage. Would someone who's supposedly career savvy have put herself in such a position to risk everything financially and career wise? I don't buy that.\n\nThe truth is usually in the middle.\n\n\"Would someone who's supposedly career savvy have put herself in such a position to risk everything financially and career wise? I don't buy that.\"\n\nOh, come on. She never gave a damn about Burt Reynolds. All she wanted was his money. He said she bought everything \"in triplicate\"; gowns, cars, diamonds. He gave a credit card worth $45,000 and she maxed it out in less than a month. She stayed with him because she wanted his money, which at the time, he had a lot of.\n\nShe went to the same high school I did about 20 years beforehand, and was the homecoming queen. The teachers who knew her said she was very nice.\n\nThe only one who ever had a bad thing to say about her publicly was BR. What does that tell you? Her other ex husbands never said anything negative. Her co stars loved her.\n\nBurt was a big bully by many accounts. Drugs can do that to people. She said she spent her own money. She raised Quinton. She was gracious to him when he died and gave him a public tribute. She didn't have to do that. But she has class.\n\nTeam Loni."
