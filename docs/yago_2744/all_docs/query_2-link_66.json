        "text": "Burt Reynolds let us into his Valhalla, and the revelations shared at his Florida home were doozies.\n\nWith his new book, But Enough About Me: A Memoir, coming out Nov. 17, the legendary actor sat down with Vanity Fair at his compound in Florida's Palm Beach County to divulge on some of the rumors and loves of his life that have haunted him for years, which he described as \"certain regrets and issues I've lived with.\"\n\nWATCH: Burt Reynolds Looks Strikingly Frail While Attending His First Comic Con\n\nLast year, when rumors surfaced that he was in serious financial trouble because he was putting more than 600 personal items up for auction in Las Vegas, Reynolds told ET exclusively that he was \"not broke.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old actor is still angry about the assumptions surrounding his December 2014 auction. \"That pisses me off,\" he told the magazine. \"That's one of the rare things that does piss me off.\"\n\n\"I'm not bankrupt, by any means. I'm not even worried about it,\" he added.\n\nBut Reynolds, who has filed for bankruptcy in the 1990s, does admit that he hasn't always made the best financial decisions.\n\n\"I've lost more money than is possible because I just haven't watched it,\" he said. \"I've still done well in terms of owning property and things like that. But I haven't been somebody who's been smart about his money. There are a couple of actors who are quite brilliant with the way they've handled their money.\"\n\nMORE: EXCLUSIVE: Burt Reynolds Says ‘I Am Not Broke'\n\nVF says that at his peak, Reynolds was making $10 million per year. He owned seven properties, including Valhalla, a private jet, numerous sports cars, 150 horses and over $100,000 worth of toupees. Many of his investments, including forays into the restaurant chain Po’ Folks and the United States Football League's Tampa Bay Bandits, either lost money or struggled, and his divorce to Loni Anderson dropped his net worth from $15 million to $5 million.\n\nReynolds knows he is to blame while also saying, \"I trusted the wrong people with my money.\" But the one thing that costs him the most, he believes, is \"women.\"\n\nThere is one woman who has cost him the most, but that has more to do with emotions than dollars. Reynolds says that Sally Field, who he dated in the '70s before breaking up in the '80s, is the \"love of my life,\" even though they haven't been together for decades.\n\n\"I miss her terribly,\" he said. \"Even now, it's hard on me. I don't know why I was so stupid. Men are like that, you know. You find the perfect person, and then you do everything you can to screw it up.\"\n\nWATCH: 50 Cent Speaks Out on Bankruptcy Filing\n\nOver his lengthy career, the Deliverance star was known as a bit of a lothario, having married Anderson and Laugh-In's Judy Carne, as well as romancing Field, Dinah Shore and Chris Evert. Now, he is dating a Florida woman, Rhonda Stearns, whom he's known for years.\n\nBut when asked by what his biggest regret is, Reynolds doesn't name any of those women, even Field. Rather, he says, \"I would have spent more money and had a lot more fun.\""
