        "text": "Burt Reynolds’ ex-wife, Loni Anderson, and their adopted son, Quinton Reynolds, joined about 80 other close friends and family members for a private memorial service for the late actor in his beloved Florida, USA Today is reporting.\n\nAbout 80 people turned up at Quattlebaum Funeral Home in North Palm Beach to pay their respects to the Smokey And The Bandit actor, who died September 6 at the age of 82. The ceremony was closed to the public.\n\nBurt Reynolds considered Florida his home. He graduated from high school there, went to college there, owned property there, and died there. And his Thursday memorial service reflected his Florida roots: the service was opened with a prayer and a eulogy by former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden.\n\nA spokesperson for the family, speaking anonymously, said that Loni and Quinton both spoke at the ceremony. It has not been revealed what either of them said, however."
