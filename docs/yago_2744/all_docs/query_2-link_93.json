        "text": "More than two decades after her divorce from Burt Reynolds, Loni Anderson is finally getting around to one of the peskiest parts of a breakup: unloading all the stuff her ex gave her while they were together.\n\nIn a recent interview with \"Entertainment Tonight,\" the 69-year-old actress explained why she she's auctioning off all the gifts she received from Reynolds during their five-year marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"About a year ago we were having dinner with our son,\" Anderson said. \"Jon Voight was at the dinner with us, and we were all talking about all the stuff that you accumulate over the years. We'd been thinking about scaling back: 'What are we gonna do with all this stuff? Do you have a museum for yourself? No.' And so what are you gonna do with it? Share it.\"\n\nThe auction, which takes place in Beverly Hills this Friday and Saturday, includes diamonds, furs and paintings given as gifts from Reynolds. The \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" actress is also auctioning off the wedding gown she wore when she married the actor in 1988.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnderson isn't the only one doing a little housekeeping. Reynolds is also unloading more than 600 personal items -- including his 1998 Golden Globe for his role in \"Boogie Nights\" -- in an auction of his own at The Palms in Las Vegas on Dec. 11 and 12.\n\nThe 78-year-old actor told ET earlier this week the sale has nothing to do with his reported financial troubles\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I want everyone to know that contrary to what all the news outlets are saying, I am not broke,\" the former box office star said. \"I have been dealing with a business dispute for many years as well as a divorce settlement. I am simply selling some of my memorabilia that I have enjoyed for so many years but do not have use nor room for them anymore.\"\n\nThe former couple made headlines earlier this year after Anderson claimed Reynolds still owed her $155,000 from their divorce settlement. In spite of that -- and their notoriously bitter 1993 divorce -- the former pair seem to be on good terms today.\n\n\"You just need a break after [a split],\" Anderson said. \"If it's a messy divorce, then you need a break and you go back and you go, 'Well there wasn't 12 terrible years. There was just that end.' So you go back and start thinking, 'Oh, I remember that! Oh, we laughed so hard! Oh, that was so fun!'\""
