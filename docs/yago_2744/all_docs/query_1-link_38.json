        "text": "Tall, buxom, blonde leading lady, almost exclusively on TV, best known for her amusing work as Jennifer, the perfect receptionist who inexplicably manages to live glamorously on her modest income, on the popular CBS sitcom, \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" (1978-82). After the show ended, Anderson kept very busy on TV in a series of specials (especially Bob Hope's regular comedy-variety fests) and in many TV-movies, often remakes of old film classics. (Among these are 1980s TV versions of \"A Letter to Three Wives,\" \"Leave Her to Heaven,\" \"Three Coins in the Fountain\" and \"Sorry, Wrong Number\"; she also played classical Hollywood film stars Thelma Todd and Jayne Mansfield in TV biopics.) Anderson married actor Burt Reynolds (with whom she had worked in the feature film \"Stroker Ace\" in 1983) in 1988 and adopted a son with him, but in the summer of 1993, they filed for divorce in a much-publicized media mudslinging battle."
