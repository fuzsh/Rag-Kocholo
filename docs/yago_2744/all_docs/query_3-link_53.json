        "text": "BURT Reynolds, the star of a string of hit movies in the 70s, has died at home at the age of 82, his agent confirmed.\n\nThe iconic actor is perhaps most famously known for his role in 1977's Smokey and the Bandit as well as Boogie Nights, 20 years later.\n\nWho was Burt Reynolds?\n\nBurton Leon Reynolds Jr was an American actor who first rose to fame in TV shows like Gunsmoke and Dan August.\n\nHe soon moved to films where he quickly became a household name with appearances in Deliverance, in 1972, and The Longest Yard, two years later.\n\nReynolds was a huge box office attraction in the 70s with his perhaps best-known film being Smokey and the Bandit where he starred in the action comedy alongside Sally Field.\n\nIt was the second-biggest grossing film in 1977 behind Star Wars.\n\nHe also starred in Hooper the following year, as well as The Cannonball Run in 1981 and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas in 1982.\n\nReynolds was nominated for an Oscar as the best supporting actor for his part in Boogie Nights, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nBut despite all his fame and success, the star filed for bankruptcy in 1996.\n\nThe Hollywood icon's death was announced on September 6, 2018, by his publicist.\n\nWho were his ex-wives Judy Carne and Loni Anderson?\n\nReynolds married his first wife Judy Carne, an English actress, in 1963, and they were together for two years, divorcing in 1965.\n\nShe appeared in a number of TV shows including The Man from UNCLE, Bonanza and Alias Smith and Jones.\n\nBut she found fame on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In where she would end a routine by saying \"Sock it to me!\" before she was doused with water or hit with an object.\n\nCarne became a heroin addict and in 1978 was arrested for possession but was later found not guilty.\n\nShe was also involved in a car accident and broke her neck in the same year.\n\nHer drug problem continued and she was again arrested for possession.\n\nHer 1985 autobiography Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl detailed her battle with drugs, her failed marriage to Reynolds and her bisexuality.\n\nShe died in Northamptonshire in September 2015.\n\nAmerican actress Loni Anderson and Reynolds married in 1988 but divorced in 1993.\n\nReynolds was her third husband.\n\nAnderson is best known for her role as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe in the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati, which ran from 1978 to 1982 and earned her three Golden Globe awards and two Emmy nominations.\n\nThey starred in the film Stroker Ace together in 1983 which ended up being a box office flop.\n\nReynolds also had an affair with Dinah Shore for a number of years in the early 70s and had a relationship with Sally Fields from 1977 to 1982.\n\nDid he have any children?\n\nHe and Anderson adopted a son, Quinton, when they were together.\n\nQuinton was born in August 1988."
