Haunted by the fear he may have killed a beautiful young model during his transformation as the Hulk, Banner returns to the scene of the crime and gets a job as a playboyâs valet. The job almost ends up with Banner a prisoner in a car headed for a trash compactor.\n\nWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\n\nKimberly asks Peter to take Michael out of town for a few days so that she can have time to herself. Michael and Peter head to Palm Springs, where they are judges in a teen beauty pageant."
