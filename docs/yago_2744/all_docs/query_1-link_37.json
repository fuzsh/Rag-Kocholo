        "text": "JUPITER, Fla. -- Longtime romantic partners Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson married Friday in a private and traditional wedding ceremony at a chapel on the actor's huge Florida ranch.\n\n'We are both thrilled to be newlyweds,' Reynolds said through a spokeswoman. 'I love being a newlywed at my age.'\n\nThe marriage license issued March 2 said it was the second wedding for Reynolds, 52, and the third for Anderson, 41.\n\nReynolds, dressed in navy blue, and Anderson, in a white knee-length gown with a high Victorian collar and a very lacy bodice, exchanged vows before 60 guests, including celebrities Dom DeLuise, Perry Como, Jerry Reed, Ann-Margret and Jim Nabors, who sang 'The Lord's Prayer.'\n\nAnderson's daughter, Deidra Hoffman, 21, was the maid of honor and her sister, Andrea Sams, was matron of honor. Reynolds' college friend, Vic Prinzi of Tampa, was the best man.\n\nReynolds' mother and father, residents of Jupiter, several brothers and sisters; and Anderson's brother-in-law and several West Coast associates attended the one-hour ceremony.\n\nThe couple will spend five days in the Bahamas aboard the Golden Eagle, a yacht owned by brewery magnate Augustin Busch, spokeswoman Peggy Gossett said.\n\nEarlier in the week The Boston Herald quoted a friend of Reynolds as saying the couple wanted to have children together, but Anderson insisted they first be married.\n\nReynolds divorced actress Judy Carne in 1965; Anderson's last marriage was dissolved in 1981. She listed the Reynolds' ranch as her address on the license.\n\nReynolds joked about a $10,000 bet made with comedian Johnny Carson, who in January said Reynolds would not get married. 'If anyone asks about the $10 thousand bet from Johnny Carson, I'm going to be using the money for the honeymoon.'\n\nGawkers were kept well away behind walls and fences patrolled from within the estate north of West Palm Beach by police and dogs. Neighbors and fans held up posters wishing 'Good luck Loni and Burt' and telling the couple 'We love you.'\n\nVows were exchanged inside the reddish-brown chapel. The bride and groom then were driven by motorized carriage to another building on the compound for the reception.\n\nOther guests included Bert Convy, Reynolds' partner in the syndicated TV show 'Win, Lose or Draw,' and Joyce DeWitt, Ossie Davis, Joe Silver and Ted McGinley, who are appearing at Reynolds' Jupiter Theater.\n\nBernie Casey, an NFL star who appeared with Reynolds in 'Sharkey's Machine,' and Robbie Benson, wife Carla Di Vito and their young son also attended.\n\nAt the reception in a barn, guests ate fresh seafood, an oyster buffet and sliced fillet, fruit and cheese, and sandwiches while the theater's orchestra played, said theater spokeswoman Peggy Gossett.\n\nStudents at an actor's institute established at the theater sang 'When I Fall in Love,' then headed off to work in the nightly production."
