        "text": "Hollywood's nastiest divorce just got nastier.\n\nBurt Reynolds, who had been denying that he has a mistress, once again has turned to the National Enquirer to confirm he has had a two-year affair with a 35-year-old, 5-foot-5 former cheerleader for the Tampa Bay Rowdies soccer team.\n\nAccompanying the story are photographs of the lovers, some taken only weeks ago.\n\nIn a story headlined, \"Burt Bares Secret 2-Year Affair With Gorgeous Blonde,\" Reynolds said he has been involved with Pam Seals, who is now a cocktail waitress in Tampa.\n\n\"My marriage with Loni has been an empty shell for 2{ years,\" he said in the Enquirer story. \"Now Pam and I don't want to hide in the shadows anymore. I want to be able to take Pam out in the public without everyone speculating about who the beautiful woman with Burt is.\"\n\nAccompanying the story are photographs of the lovers in a hot tub and holding champagne glasses, taken last year in Tampa; of Seals and Reynolds at the premiere of his movie, Cop and a Half; and Seals on the set of his series B.L. Stryker in 1989, when the two were \"just friends.\"\n\nAdditional photos show Seals testing the water in Reynolds' pool in late July at his Los Angeles home, and Reynolds and his friend Charles Nelson Reilly smoking cigars in celebration of the latest Enquirer story.\n\nA source at the Enquirer explained Reynolds' sudden change of heart after denying the extra-marital romance.\n\n\"He's very much in love and wants to be able to take her out in public,\" the source said.\n\nThere is more to this, however. Ever since Reynolds announced he was divorcing Anderson, a tabloid war has exploded, with the actor giving his exclusive story to the Enquirer. Soon after, a former Dallas Cowboy and acting protege, Terry Warren, accused Anderson of repeatedly trying to seduce him in another Enquirer story.\n\nAnderson, at a television critics press conference last month, denied this allegation.\n\nThis week, the Globe, an Enquirer rival, published a story headlined: \"Burt's Marrying His Blond Waitress.\" Scott Jackson, a spokesman for Reynolds, denied the story.\n\nAlso hitting the stands this month is Anderson's tale of the breakup in Good Housekeeping. There are several other publications preparing stories on the split. It is believed Reynolds wanted to pre-empt these stories with the latest revelation to present his point of view.\n\nAnderson is currently working on Nurses and was not available for comment. She repeatedly has avoided comment on the matter, although she has said she was surprised by her husband's decision about the divorce.\n\nIn the divorce, Reynolds has take the highly unusual step of using a supermarket tabloid as his principal outlet. Hollywood stars usually shun the tabloids."
