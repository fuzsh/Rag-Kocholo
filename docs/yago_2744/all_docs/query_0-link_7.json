        "text": "Loni Anderson and Burt Reynolds were married for just seven years, but their divorce has been dragging on for the last 22.\n\nThe divorce settlement for the Stroker Ace co-stars has finally been fulfilled, according to court documents filed by Anderson, 70. TMZ reports that Reynolds, 79, paid her the remaining balance he owed her, which was $154,520.\n\nMostly because we enjoy looking at photos of them in matching outfits — and, of course, seeing Burt's mustache in its prime — we look back at their long and winding divorce history…\n\n1981: Reynolds, whose recent exes included Sally Field and Dinah Shore, meets Anderson on The Merv Griffin Show. He starts pursuing her fiercely, showering her with gifts, including a Rolls-Royce.\n\n1982: Anderson, who was twice-divorced, waits a year before agreeing to date Reynolds, who was also a divorcee. \"I was terrified,\" the WKRP in Cincinnati sex symbol later told People magazine. \"I expected a glib ladies man, which he's not. He is an introspective man with deep emotions.\"\n\n1983: Their movie Stroker Ace comes out.\n\n1984: They move in together. Burt is injured on a movie set, leading to a diagnosis of TMJ (temporomandibular-joint disorder). He is nearly immobile for two years, and, by his own account, he starts taking up to 50 tablets a day of the antidepressant Halcion. The Nurses star, um, nurses him through.\n\nApril 29, 1988: They tie the knot at his 160-acre ranch in Jupiter, Florida, in front of guests including Ann-Margret and Perry Como. \"I married my best friend today,\" Burt says at the reception. Loni replies, \"I feel like Cinderella. I married Prince Charming.\" A pre-nup is in place for their combined fortune (he's worth $15 million to her $1 million), but there is a clause making it invalid if they have children.\n\nAug. 31, 1988: Their son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds, is born and they adopt him a few weeks later. \"Every night we say, 'Aren't we blessed?'\" Loni later told People magazine. \"We have each other. We have Quinton… Sometimes we just get giddy about it and laugh.\"\n\nJune 11, 1993: Burt sues Loni for divorce in Florida, saying in a statement that their marriage is \"irretrievably broken.\" He went on to say that while he has \"the highest respect and regard\" for her, \"he feels his priorities and hers have become different.\" Loni countersues in California, where there is a 50-50-split community-property law.\n\nJune 22, 1993: Burt is interviewed by National Enquirer and calls rumors that he cheated \"flat-out damn lies.\" Weeks later, Pam Seals, a cocktail-lounge manager at a Tampa restaurant, comes forward and says she's been having a two-year affair with Burt.\n\nAug. 24, 1993: Burt admits on Good Morning America: Evening Edition that he's involved with another woman, but he didn't start it. \"I caught [Loni] cheating on me [first],\" says the star, who goes on to have a lengthy relationship with Seals. He also challenges his estranged wife to a lie-detector test to determine who cheated first. \"If she wins, I will give her everything I own, including my ranch, my house, a lot of Western art she doesn't want, and her $13 million she was asking for. If I win, I get Quinton. That's all I want.\"\n\nApril 1994: Reynold's show Evening Shade is canceled and that is just part of the actor's cash flow problems. He lost millions in commercial endorsements following his split with Loni. He also starts shelling out $47,000 a month in divorce-related expenditures.\n\nDec. 7, 1994: After two days in a California courtroom, they resolve their custody battle over Quinton and leave court hand-in-hand. The terms are sealed, but on the courthouse stairs Anderson tells the press, \"We've reached a decision amicably for our son's sake, who we love very much.\" As for Reynolds, he says, \"Pick on Kevin Costner or somebody else. This saga is over.\"\n\nDecember 1996: Burt files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in Florida, claiming more than $10 million in debts. He blames his financial dilemma on mismanagement and bad investments. Some of those include the failed football team the Tampa Bay Bandits, a nightclub called Burt’s Place in Atlanta, and a chain of restaurants. He gets to keep his ranch and must continue make alimony and child support payments to Loni.\n\n1999: Anderson releases a book, My Life in High Heels, which includes details of their failed marriage, including accusations that Reynolds was physically abusive. While promoting the book, she tells the San Francisco Chronicle that Reynolds often doesn't pay the mortgage payments on her $2.3 million home, as stipulated in their divorce settlement, or the $15,000 monthly child support payment.\n\n2004: Reynolds's relationship with Seals ends with claims she tried to extort money from him and a nasty court battle costing him even more money.\n\n2011: Following a quadruple heart bypass and a stint in rehab for an addiction to prescription drugs, a mortgage company forecloses on Reynold's Florida waterfront home, claiming he hadn't made a payment in a year. \"I am as surprised as everyone,\" he says in a statement.\n\nJuly 2014: Loni goes to court saying that Burt still owes her $97,000 from their divorce settlement. With interest, she demands, $154,520.98 so they can be free of each other one and for all.\n\nNovember 2014: Burt auctions off personal memorabilia to rectify his financial woes. Items on the block include his 1998 Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in Boogie Nights and a red leather jacket from Smokey and the Bandit II.\n\nDecember 2014: Loni also auctions off memorabilia from her famous marriage, including gifts of diamonds, paintings, and furs Burt gave her as well as her 1988 wedding dress. While promoting the sale, she says that she and Burt are now friendly and had dinner the year before with their son, who's now 27."
