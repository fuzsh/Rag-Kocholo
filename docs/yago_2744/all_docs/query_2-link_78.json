Meanwhile, his father's net worth dropped from the $60 million he had at his career peak to around $5 million at his death. The actor was very open about his money problems.\n\nDuring the height of his career, Reynolds would earn around $10 million annually. Instead of financial growth, his poor business investments in the restaurant industry made him lose about $20 million.\n\nWhen the actor fell into over $10 million debt, the situation forced him to file for bankruptcy in 1996. Besides his flawed business decisions, Reynolds went broke because his divorce from Loni Anderson affected his career.\n\nThe actor's earnings declined when CBS canceled his American sitcom, Evening Shade, due to bad publicity from the bitter divorce.
