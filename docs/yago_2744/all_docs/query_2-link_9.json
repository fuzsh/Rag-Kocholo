        "text": "Loni Anderson is back with a new film that is very nostalgic for the 1980s. She stars in Ladies of the ’80s: A Divas Christmas alongside Morgan Fairchild, Linda Gray, Donna Mills, and Nicollette Sheridan. In the film, the ladies reunite to shoot one final Christmas episode of a long-running soap opera and of course, things get a little dramatic with so many divas. In honor of her new Christmas movie, Anderson is sharing some fun tidbits from her past.\n\nAnderson decided to open up about meeting the late Fred Astaire for the first time. Her husband at the time, Burt Reynolds, knew she was a huge fan of Astaire. She explained, “As a surprise, Burt invited Fred to dinner. As he came down the stairs, he did a whole tap number.” Astaire wasn’t her only celebrity crush. She revealed that she was also smitten with Cary Grant. She added, “The most famous person in my phone book was Cary Grant. When I met him, I was a blithering idiot. He became a friend, but I never got over my crush.”\n\nDuring the interview, Anderson shared some other fun facts about herself, including more about her time spent married to Reynolds from 1988 to 1994. She spoke about another gift that Reynolds had made for her, “My first car was a turquoise Chevy Impala convertible with white leather interior and moon hubcaps. I talked about it so much that when I was married to Burt [Reynolds], he had a lovely painting done of my car and I still have it hanging up.”\n\nShe has been married to musician Bob Flick, a founding member of the band The Brothers Four, since 2008. While he mainly stays out of the spotlight, the couple was seen together at a recent red carpet event and looked very happy. Anderson also revealed that they love to go on vacation to Italy because of the beautiful water and scenery. She added to her list of fun facts that her favorite room in her home is her bedroom because “she’s close to makeup, hair, wardrobe, intimacy, and TV if I want it.”\n\nWatch Ladies of the ’80s: A Divas Christmas on Lifetime."
