Absolutely not.”\n\nReynolds and Anderson wed in 1988 and separated six years later. The actor has been candid in discussing their marriage, previously telling PEOPLE, “I should have known that you don’t marry an actress.”\n\nSo who did steal his heart? Easy, Sally Field.\n\nRecently, the actor has been vocal about his love for the actress. He stressed to Men’s Health that his feelings for Field haven’t been over-romanticized over the years.\n\n“It’s the absolute truth,” he said. “I’ve replayed it enough times in my head. Sally was the one.”\n\nReynolds said poor timing ultimately doomed the pair.\n\n“The timing just didn’t work out. There was a time when she wanted us to stay together, and there was a time when I wanted us to stay together,” he added. “We just never felt the same way at the same time.”\n\nBut Field’s wasn’t Reynolds only missed opportunity. The actor also revealed that he regrets turning down Greta Garbo and never sealing the deal with her.\n\nReynolds said he was 20 when he met Garbo at party in New York and she started hitting on him.\n\n“She invited me back to her place after the party, and I didn’t go,” he said. “What a putz! What was I thinking?”"
