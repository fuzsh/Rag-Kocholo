        "text": "In 1981, when actor Burt Reynolds met Loni Anderson, little did he know they would go on to become one of Hollywood's most revered power couples of the '80s. \"Whether this relationship will go any further than it has right now, I have no idea,\" Burt told People in 1982. \"Loni and I are both trying very hard to get acquainted and to like each other without too many explosions and broadsides from the press.\" Six years later, the two were married in an intimate Florida ceremony. \"I feel like Cinderella. I married Prince Charming,\" she gushed to People at the time. The fairy tale, however, did not last long.\n\nFive years after saying \"I do,\" Reynolds filed for divorce from Anderson claiming in court documents, per UPI, that their union was irretrievably broken. \"The decision to divorce was amicable and we're still friends. We felt it was the best thing to do at this time,\" Anderson later said in a statement, as reported by The Palm Beach Post. But in true Hollywood fashion, this divorce was anything but amicable.\n\nFollowing their divorce, Reynolds and Anderson were locked in a contentious custody battle over their adopted son, Quinton. While Reynolds described Anderson as an unemployed star suffering from low self-esteem, the \"Deadly Family Secrets\" star alleged, according to the Los Angeles Times, that she was physically abused during their marriage. While both stars eventually sorted out their issues, Anderson has maintained a low profile in the years since, begging the big question â€” where is Loni Anderson now?\n\nFourth time is the charm! Her first three marriages might not have worked out, but Loni Anderson was not one to give up on love. And on May 17, 2008, exactly 45 years after they first met, Anderson married Bob Flick, folk singer and founding member of the music group The Brothers Four. According to People, the couple first met at a movie premiere in 1963 when a young Anderson was sent by a local newspaper in Minneapolis to pose for a photo with the folk singer. An intriguing story, no doubt, Anderson and Flick agree that fate brought them back to each other. \"We do say that. I mean, it's so bizarre how we came back together from our beginning,\" the actor said in a 2019 interview with Studio 10.\n\nBut even though their relationship ended up coming full circle, Anderson wishes she married Flick earlier than she did. \"I married the man I should have married in 1963,\" she said in the sit-down with Studio 10. \"But then I wouldn't have had all the wonderful people in my life that I have.\" And if you were wondering how Flick feels about his superstar wife, he's just as hopelessly in love with Anderson. \"I go everywhere with her,\" Flick gushed during the same Studio 10 interview.\n\nFollowing a successful run in the late '70s and early '80s, it was not long before Loni Anderson started experiencing a decline in her career. Though she continued to land both television and film roles, Anderson was never able to replicate the success and fame she once previously enjoyed. As listed on her IMDb, between 2003 and 2004, Anderson played the role of Mandi Mullet-Heidecker in the comedy series, \"The Mullet.\" Two years later, the three-time Golden Globe winner landed a role as Tori Spelling's mother, Kiki Spelling, in \"So Notorious,\" a parodical series that saw the \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" star played a fictionalized version of herself.\n\nIn 2016, after a long hiatus from acting, Anderson returned to showbiz with a role in \"My Sister Is So Gay,\" a web series chronicling the life of a middle aged gay man who suspects that his sister is in the closet. In the series, Anderson potrays Frances, an overly dramatic mother who wholeheartedly supports her gay kids. The project, she believes, was important to foster inclusivity and representation in the entertainment scene at the time. \"Needless to say I've had my hysterical moments over the [2016 presidential] election and I have a granddaughter who's a junior at UCLA and we have had many spirited discussions about our feelings,\" Anderson told HuffPost of her decision to take on the role."
