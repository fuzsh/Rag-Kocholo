Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson, who were married in April, are in the process of adopting a child, a publicist for the actress said Tuesday. Anderson, 42, and Reynolds, 52, who were together for more than six years before tying the knot last spring in Florida, have a house in exclusive Holmby Hills near Los Angeles and a ranch in Jupiter, Fla. Anderson's publicist said the couple is waiting for the unidentified mother to give birth to the child "within the next five to seven days. "They had been talking about it for a long while," Mickey Freeman said. "They do both very much want to have a child, so it kind of works out beautifully." Freeman said they do not yet know whether the baby will be a boy or a girl. Anderson, who starred as the blond receptionist on the television comedy series "WKRP in Cincinnati" from 1978 to 1982, had been married twice before and has a 21-year-old daughter.
