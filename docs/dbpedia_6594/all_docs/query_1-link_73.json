        "text": "One of Bob's clones in Delta Eridani. Bender headed out into the great unknown at the same time as Luke.\n\nFor the younger generation of Bobs, he became a kind of legend about the Flying Dutchman. Bender was presumed dead until Bob went looking for him and discovered that Bender had changed course after seeing an unusual infrared signature from Eta Laporis. The signature was caused by a Topolis megastructure called the River of Heaven. Bender was shot down by the Sky River's \"Administrator\" and taken to the facility for further interrogation. It was subsequently intercepted by a local rebel movement, who used it to preserve and increase knowledge about technology. Bender remained there until Bob and several other early generation replicants came to rescue him from the area."
