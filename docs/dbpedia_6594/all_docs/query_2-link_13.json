        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Head coach Jeff Walz and his staff picked up a local commitment as Sacred Heart Academy guard Reagan Bender signed with the Cardinals. She is the seventh freshman to announce her pledge to Louisville in the class of 2024 and she chose the Cards over Western Kentucky.\n\n\"Community is important to the culture of our program, and being a local talent, Reagan brings to us an outstanding work ethic and championship pedigree,\" said Walz. \"Her basketball IQ and ability to stretch the floor as a prolific three-point shooter and scorer will no doubt be a welcome sight for our fan base!\"\n\nBender is coming off her senior season as she led Sacred Heart to its fourth-straight state title. They become the first program, boys or girls, in the state of Kentucky to win four-straight state titles. Bender scored 18 points in the championship game as the Valkyries defeated McCracken County, 60-49.\n\nFor her senior year, Bender averaged 13.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.9 steals per game as Sacred Heart ended the season with a 31-7 record. She was named to the all-tournament team and The Courier Journal's All-Seventh Region girls basketball team following the state tournament.\n\nIn four seasons as a starter at Sacred Heart, Bender scored 1,818 points and grabbed 477 rebounds and hit 212 three-pointers during her career. She led Sacred Heart to a 128-20 record in those four years and was a finalist for Miss Basketball in the state of Kentucky.\n\nIn her junior season, Sacred Heart finished 36-3 for a second-straight season and Bender averaged 15.2 points and 3.1 rebounds. She shot 48.8 percent from the field and was 33 percent from three-point range (64-of-194). She was a first-team All-State selection following her junior campaign. As a sophomore, Bender averaged 11.4 points and 3.2 rebounds a game, while she hit for 10.1 points and 4.2 rebounds as a freshman.\n\nBender already has family connections to Louisville. Her grandfather, Bob Bender Sr., graduated from the University of Louisville in 1957, where he lettered for four years in football as a defensive end and offensive lineman. He was inducted into the University of Louisville Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nBender joins a class that already contains Imari Berry, Mackenly Randolph, Izela Arenas, Tajianna Roberts, Anaya Hardy and Isla Juffermans.\n\nFOLLOW LOUISVILLE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor the latest on Louisville women's basketball, visit GoCards.com, or follow the team's Instagram account at @LouisvilleWBB, X account at @LouisvilleWBB or on Facebook at facebook.com/louisvillewbb."
