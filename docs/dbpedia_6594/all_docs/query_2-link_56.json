        "text": "Men's Lacrosse 6/29/2021 3:45:00 PM Ernest Meyers, Assistant A.D. for Media Relations\n\nLimestone Athletics Names Joe Bender as the 2021 Student-Athlete Alumni of the Year\n\nGAFFNEY, S.C. – Limestone University recently named Joe Bender '01 as the 2021 Limestone Athletics Student-Athlete Alumni of the Year Award winner during its Virtual Awards Ceremony earlier this summer.\n\nBender was a three-year starter in goal with the Limestone men's lacrosse team during the early years of the program. Like many of the pioneers that he played with in the late 1990's, Bender helped to lay the foundation for the success of the program on the national stage over the two decades since graduating.\n\nThe 1996 team MVP ranks third all-time in team history with 444 career saves and is currently 11th in career goals against average. He is the program's single-season record holder for most saves in a year, posting 227 saves during the 1997 campaign, while also ranking fourth with 188 saves in the 1996 season. Limestone went 22-16 with Bender as a starter with an 11-3 mark in Deep South Conference play and helped guide the Saints to the 1998 Deep South Conference Regular Season Championship.\n\nTwo seasons later, the Blue and Gold shocked the lacrosse world by winning the 2000 NCAA Division II National Championship before Bender helped the team reach the national title game the following year as a student assistant coach in 2001. Limestone won the title again in 2002 during a run of six straight national championship game appearances.\n\nThe Maryland native remained in Gaffney after graduating from Limestone in 2001 and along with his wife, April, raised a family in the Cherokee County community. Bender, who is the regional director of sales with Eisai, Inc., has continued his support of Saints Athletics over the years and is often seen on campus taking in a sporting event. Bender was recently selected to serve as the President of the Saints Club – Limestone's Athletics Booster Club that provides financial and promotional support for more than 800 student-athletes and 25 NCAA Division II athletic teams. Let's get to know Bender a little better.\n\nWhat sport(s) did you play at Limestone?\n\nBender: Men's lacrosse.\n\nWhat year did you graduate?\n\nBender: 2001.\n\nHave you obtained a higher level of education since graduating from Limestone?\n\nBender: No.\n\nWhere is your current place of employment?\n\nBender: Eisai, Inc.\n\nWhat is your current job title and what does that position entail?\n\nBender: I am the Regional Director of Sales, supervising eight sales leaders and 65 sales professionals across the Southeast.\n\nWhy did you choose to attend Limestone?\n\nBender: The opportunity to play college lacrosse and to receive a college education.\n\nHow did your time as a Limestone student-athlete prepare you for your career?\n\nBender: As a student-athlete you learn the value of teamwork, achievement of goals, overcoming adversity, and balancing priorities to ensure excellence in all day-to-day activities.\n\nWhat is your fondest memory of being a Limestone student-athlete?\n\nBender: Honestly, my entire time at Limestone. It helped shape the man and the father that I am today.\n\nWhat would you say is your greatest athletic or academic accomplishment during your time at Limestone?\n\nBender: Being named the team's MVP in 1996.\n\nAre you still involved in athletics in some capacity?\n\nBender: Yes, I am the President of the Saints Club.\n\nWhat are some of your hobbies and other interests?\n\nBender: Watching sports, any sport, and then just being present and helping my children pursue their goals and interests.\n\nWhat are some of things from your professional career that you are most proud of?\n\nBender: I have earned three President's Club Awards as the top sales performer.\n\nWhat kind of advice would you give to current Saints competing in athletics?\n\nBender: As a part of Limestone Athletics, you have a family for life that will always be there for you through all the good and bad times in this journey we call life."
