        "text": "The University of Louisville made it official.\n\nSacred Heart Academy guard Reagan Bender, who helped the Valkyres to another state title last weekend, has signed to the Cardinals. Bender picked U of L over Western Kentucky when she committed to U of L last month.\n\n\"Community is important to the culture of our program, and being a local talent, Reagan brings to us an outstanding work ethic and championship pedigree,\" Walz said in a release. \"Her basketball IQ and ability to stretch the floor as a prolific three-point shooter and scorer will no doubt be a welcome sight for our fan base.\"\n\nBender, who is the niece of Sacred Heart coach Donna Moir, had been on the radar of Walz and his staff for several years. She camped with the Cardinals and was one of the standouts during the camp after her freshman season and has continued to attend camps and games.\n\nThe 5-foot-10 Bender is among a seven-player Class of 2024 for the Cardinals women's basketball team. The other players in the class are forward Anaya Hardy, forward Mackenly Randolph, guard Izela Arenas, guard Tajianna Roberts, post Isla Juffermans, and Tennessee Miss Basketball Imari Berry.\n\nBender has helped the Valkyries to a 128-20 record during her four seasons, winning a state title each season. She was a finalist for Miss Basketball.\n\nIn four seasons as a starter at Sacred Heart, Bender has scored 1,818 points and grabbed 477 rebounds. She has hit 212 three-pointers during her career.\n\nAs a freshman, Bender averaged 10.1 points and 4.2 rebounds a game, while she hit for 11.4 points and 3.2 rebounds as a sophomore. Last season, Sacred Heart finished 36-3 for a second straight season and Bender averaged 15.2 points and 3.1 rebounds. She shot 48.8 percent from the field, 33 percent from three-point range - 64 of 194 - and hit 75.5 percent from the free-throw line. She was a first-team All-State selection as a junior.\n\nAs a senior, Bender averaged 13.4 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 1.9 steals a game. She averaged 13.4 points during her career.\n\nIn the state championship game on Saturday night, Bender had 18 points in the win over McCracken County.\n\nBender has connections to U of L. Her grandfather, Bob Bender Sr., graduated from the University of Louisville in 1957, where he lettered for four years in football as a defensive end and offensive lineman. He was inducted into the University of Louisville Hall of Fame in 1992."
