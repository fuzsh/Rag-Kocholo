Alumni of the spectacular Blues outfit Roomful of Blues, Doug is a Turn It Up trumpeter that blends a musical cocktail that is stout and refreshing. A master of many genres, he embodies the prolific style of Miles Davis with his own personal tone to deliver a richness as flavorful as Memphis fried chicken and New Orleans Gumbo. Doug Woolverton is a welcome addition to any ensemble and is a huge part of the Bender Brass.\n\nMark Earley - Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame inductee, 2 -time Grammy-nominated and 6 -time W.C.

You'll see Red Young at his best on the stages of the Bender, and you'll be long gone in his craft on the ebony & ivory keys.\n\nNick Schnebelen - Welcome the newest member of the Bender Brass Band!\n\nMultiple Blues Music Award Winner. From 2018 to 2022, Nick Schnebelen and his band have been touring North America as the opening act for George Thorogood and the Destroyers.

Nick got his introduction to the worldwide Blues community in 2008, along with siblings Danielle and Kris, as a founding member of the Kansas City band Trampled Under Foot.

Mike was recently appointed to the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress, representing the American Federation of Musicians.\n\nDavid Kida - I was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1960. I grew up in a house filled with music. Both my older brothers played the drums so I had a front-row seat for all their bands practicing. And I knew from an early age that drumming was what I wanted to do. I followed the family tradition and began playing at a pretty early age. I started playing in bands at 13, and was working in clubs by 16. A few bands later and I was playing my first road gigs by 18. I got the chance to play on the island of Montserrat in 1981. And while there had the chance to record at Air Studio. After that, it was the big move to Los Angeles in 1982. I thought it would be easy… Join a band… Get a record deal… Be a Rock Star!!!! BOY WAS I WRONG!!! But I did learn a lot in those years… How to keep playing music while doing whatever day job I could find to keep the dream alive. I played with some great players in those years. Some who I still play with today. Most of all I learned to play a lot of styles of music. And how to play in the recording studio as well. But I always came back to the blues. I had a long-running association with Barry Levenson, I toured with him and played on several records with him in the early ’90s.\n\nIn 1998 I was asked to back up singer Janiva Magness at the PEER festival in Belgium. I was playing it with Barry Levenson… and never one to turn down a gig, jumped into the drum chair in her band for that festival. Well, we hit it off… I joined her band. And spent the next seven years touring and playing on 2 of her records too! I also was fortunate to work with Doug Macleod during this time. And I’m still proud to work with him to this day. I’ve done 3 records with him. And I really owe them both huge thanks. It led to the chance to play on some other great recordings as a studio drummer.\n\nI was asked to join Rod Piazza in the fall of 2005. I had always loved the band. I knew of the rich history of incredible musicians in his band. And I feel honored to be a part of the band. I played on the latest record \"Thrillville\" and look forward to making more records with them in the future. The Band has given me the chance to play in some amazing locations… All over Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and the constant touring of the USA.\n\nIt was my dream to play music as a kid. I feel blessed to both tour, and record for a living now. I know not everyone gets to do something they love for a living. And I never forget how lucky I am. I owe a HUGE thanks to my family for all the help along the way. To my Amazing wife Celia for always keeping the faith in me. She’s my sweet angel. And I'd be a lost soul without her!!\n\nAnd of course… to all the good people who come to see the shows. Without you, I’d be playing in my parents' basement still!! I love playing for you and thank you for your kind words & encouragement. Thanks for stopping by… SEE YOU ON THE ROAD!!"
