        "text": "The men's 100m sprint final at the Paris Olympics will go down in history as one of the closet races ever!\n\nSprinter Noah Lyles from Team USA took the gold medal, winning by just 0.005 seconds.\n\nHe came from last to first place in a personal best time of just 9.79 seconds.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson - who had led for most of the race - came in second to take silver, and Fred Kerley of Team USA took bronze.\n\nAll eight finalists finished within 0.12 seconds of Noah Lyles in a dramatic race.\n\nIt was also a big night on the racetrack in the women's 100m final on Saturday.\n\nSprinter Julien Alfred took gold to become St Lucia's first ever medal winner, with a time of 10.72 seconds.\n\nAmerican world champion Sha'Carri Richardson took silver, and Melissa Jefferson came third.\n\nGreat Britain's Daryll Neita finished four-hundredths of a second behind them to place in fourth.\n\nSpeaking about her win, Julien said: âGrowing up I used to be on the field struggling with no shoes, running barefoot, running in my school uniform, running all over the place,â\n\nâWe barely have the right facilities. The stadium is not fixed. I hope this gold medal will help St Lucia build a new stadium, to help the sport grow.â she said.\n\nSt Lucia is a volcanic island in the Caribbean, with fewer than 200,000 people living there."
