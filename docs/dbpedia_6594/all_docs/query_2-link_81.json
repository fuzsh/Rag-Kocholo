        "text": "With 40 years of coaching experience, Bob Conkling enters his 19th season as head coach at Illinois State.\n\nDuring his time at ISU, Conkling has brought great strides to the gymnastics team. In his previous 18 seasons as head coach, Conkling has secured over 100 wins and sent 12 student-athletes to the NCAA Regionals. Under Conkling's leadership, four Redbirds have been named Midwest Independent Conference Gymnast of the Year and four have been named MIC Senior of the Year. In addition, over 30 gymnasts earned spots on the All-Midwest Independent Conference First-Team.\n\nThe 2023 campaign was magical one for the Redbirds, as they headed into the MIC Championships with the highest team National Qualifying Score (NQS) in the conference at 195.010. Illinois State also posted the highest average meet score in the conference during the season of 194.517, thanks to strong efforts on floor and vault throughout the year.\n\nThe 2023 MIC Championship came down to the final routine of the night to decide which team would taking home the trophy and thanks to a clutch performance on floor by Jaye Mack, Illinois State clinched the MIC title with a program-record score of 196.375. The title was the second of Conkling's career at ISU and the first for the Redbirds since 2012.\n\nConkling was named the Midwest Independent Conference Coach of the Year following the 2022 season, after leading the team to one of their best seasons in school history. On February 25 against Southeast Missouri, Conkling helped lead the Redbirds to their season high score of a 195.875. The team's floor score of a 49.325 set in the regular season finale is the highest score he's seen on the event since his start at ISU and ranked third all-time. Not only did the Redbirds score the highest Conkling has seen on floor, but also the highest he's seen on vault, when the Redbirds crushed the previous school vault record by two tenths, scoring 49.350 at the GymQuarters Invitational on March 18."
