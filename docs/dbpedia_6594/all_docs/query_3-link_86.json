        "text": "Crumbl’s origin begins with two crazy cousins and the perfect combination of flour, sugar, and chocolate chips.\n\nCreated in 2017 when co-founders Jason McGowan and Sawyer Hemsley teamed up on a quest to bake the perfect chocolate chip cookie, they dreamt of bringing people together over a box of the best cookies in the world. Today, our franchises have reached across the nation and expanded internationally—all inspired by one big dream and the perfect ingredients that started it all.\n\nAfter the Crumbl Milk Chocolate Chip recipe was born, the Crumbl founders and their families opened the first Crumbl location in Logan, Utah.\n\nWith the genius idea of structuring the bakery as an open-concept kitchen, Crumbl provides customers a first-hand experience watching as their cookies are mixed, balled, and baked! Eventually, Crumbl’s business grew to include more flavors and services like delivery, catering, and a weekly rotating menu.\n\nCrumbl now offers a unique weekly rotating menu, featuring six delicious flavors, selected from a wide variety of cookies and desserts.\n\nEvery week, our menu rotates to feature an updated set of six exciting desserts. With our co-founders’ search for innovation, we frequently add new flavors to the menu and work to improve current recipes. We concentrate on developing delicious cookies inspired by popular flavors, tasty treats, and decadent desserts!"
