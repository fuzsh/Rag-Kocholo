        "text": "The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 was the first major U.S. law to address water pollution. Growing public awareness and concern for controlling water pollution led to sweeping amendments in 1972. As amended in 1972, the law became commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n\nThe 1972 amendments:\n\nEstablished the basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States.\n\nGave EPA the authority to implement pollution control programs such as setting wastewater standards for industry.\n\nMaintained existing requirements to set water quality standards for all contaminants in surface waters.\n\nMade it unlawful for any person to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit was obtained under its provisions.\n\nFunded the construction of sewage treatment plants under the construction grants program.\n\nRecognized the need for planning to address the critical problems posed by nonpoint source pollution.\n\nSubsequent amendments modified some of the earlier CWA provisions. Revisions in 1981 streamlined the municipal construction grants process, improving the capabilities of treatment plants built under the program. Changes in 1987 phased out the construction grants program, replacing it with the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, more commonly known as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. This new funding strategy addressed water quality needs by building on EPA-state partnerships.\n\nOver the years, many other laws have changed parts of the Clean Water Act. Title I of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990, for example, put into place parts of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, signed by the U.S. and Canada, where the two nations agreed to reduce certain toxic pollutants in the Great Lakes. That law required EPA to establish water quality criteria for the Great Lakes addressing 29 toxic pollutants with maximum levels that are safe for humans, wildlife, and aquatic life. It also required EPA to help the States implement the criteria on a specific schedule."
