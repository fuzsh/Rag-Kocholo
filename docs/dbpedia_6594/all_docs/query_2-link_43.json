        "text": "Escambia County Clerk of Courts Pam Childers has been insisting that Supervisor of Elections Robert Bender is not an incumbent.\n\nWhy this matters to Childers: Bruce Childers, her hubby, is trying to displace Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointee and win the supervisor position in a universal primary on August 20.\n\nIf Bruce wins, the Childers family will have more power than former commissioner chair W.D. Childers had in the early 2000s before he was indicted and removed from office.\n\nDig Deeper: Merriam-Webster defines incumbent as:\n\n1. the holder of an office or ecclesiastical benefice\n\n2. one that occupies a particular position or place\n\nConclusion:\n\nI’m sorry, Pam. Robert Bender holds the office and occupies the position. Therefore, Robert Bender is the incumbent Supervisor of Elections.\n\n#notreadbypamchilders\n\nReminder: Vulnerability Assessment Project Public Meeting June 20\n\nEscambia County, in partnership with Jacobs Engineering, invites residents to the first public meeting for the Vulnerability Assessment Project, an initiative aimed at safeguarding the unincorporated areas of Escambia County against environmental risks, including rising sea levels and flooding.\n\nThe meeting will take place Thursday, June 20, at 5:30 p.m. at the Marie K. Young Wedgewood Community Center, 6405 Wagner Road. Anyone interested in learning more about future flood mitigation and the possible impacts of flood events on the community is invited to attend.\n\nDuring the meeting, attendees will hear from county staff and representatives from Jacobs Engineering on the initial stages of data collection, methodologies, evaluation criteria, and analysis techniques. Staff will also discuss potential vulnerabilities and impacts on communities. Attendees will have the chance to provide input on the initial stages of the Vulnerability Assessment Project and participate in a question-and-answer session at the end of the meeting.\n\nFor more information, contact Dr. Ryan Kirby at resiliency@myescambia.com.\n\nFeatured Photo Licensed under the Unsplash+ License\n\nYour comments are welcomed, but there are some rules to follow:\n\n(1) Be Nice.
