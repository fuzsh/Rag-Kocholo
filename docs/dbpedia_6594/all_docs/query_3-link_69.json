        "text": "Nationalism is a construct, but people, culture and history are much more tangible identifiers of who we are, where we're from and what we're about. Many countries as we know them today have popped up in the last couple hundred years, while others have been around for centuries.\n\nOne country without a clear birthday is Egypt. The U.K. recognized Egypt as a country in 1922, but the Fatimid Caliphate conquered Egypt back in 969. One could even argue that Egypt was born when the First Dynasty of Egypt formed around 3100 BCE.\n\nThe founding dates for nations can vary depending on your criteria for what constitutes a country.\n\nWhat is the oldest country in the world?\n\nHere are the countries World Population Review lists as the oldest in the world by date of earliest known organized government:\n\nIran - 3200 BCE\n\nEgypt - 3100 BCE\n\nVietnam - 2879 BCE\n\nArmenia - 2492 BCE\n\nNorth Korea - 2333 BCE\n\nChina - 2070 BCE\n\nIndia - 2000 BCE\n\nGeorgia - 1300 BCE\n\nIsrael - 1300 BCE\n\nSudan - 1070 BCE\n\nAfghanistan - 678 BCE\n\nUsing a different criterion, here are the nations World Population Review lists as the oldest in the world according to their respective dates of self-sovereignty:\n\nJapan - 660 BCE\n\nChina - 221 BCE\n\nSan Marino - 301 CE\n\nFrance - 843 CE\n\nAustria - 976 CE\n\nDenmark - sometime in the 10th century CE\n\nHungary - 1001 CE\n\nPortugal - 1143 CE\n\nMongolia - 1206 CE\n\nThailand - 1238 CE\n\nOldest city in the U.S.: This spot was established in the 16th century\n\nWhat is the oldest written constitution in the world?\n\nAccording to Statista, the Magna Carta, which was written in the year 1215, is debatably the oldest constitution still in place. According to the U.K. Parliament, though, only four of the Magna Carta’s 63 clauses are still in place. With that fact in mind, it is easy to see why some think the Magna Carta should be disqualified.\n\nHere are the other countries with the oldest constitutions still in place today, according to Statista:\n\nSan Marino - 1600\n\nUnited States - 1789\n\nNorway - 1814\n\nNetherlands - 1815\n\nBelgium - 1831\n\nNew Zealand - 1852\n\nArgentina - 1853\n\nCanada - 1867\n\nLuxembourg - 1868\n\nTonga - 1875\n\nAustralia - 1901\n\nSafest place to live?: This country across the ocean ranks most peaceful\n\nJust Curious for more?
