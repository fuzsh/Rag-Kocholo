        "text": "One of my favorite collaborations to date, co-authors Timothy Kellison and Chad Seifried. Analytics meets sustainability - how quickly are renewable energy sources diffusing throughout the United States and Canada? For 175 sport facilities, full diffusion for initial renewable source adoption was predicted for 2061 while not all renewable energy sources were predicted to fully diffuse. INFORMS, Sports Business Journal\n\nThis is a global interest: whether it's podcasting with Ken's Nearest Neighbors, paneling with Sport Analytics Japan (Tatsuo Ogura. Maho Hosoda, Jessica Gelman) or podcasting with Karen JEAN-FRANCOIS and Women In Data, people want to know how competing as a professional athlete can impact analytics pursuit. I think the implications are broad. I've been thinking about this lately: as we consider student, faculty, and sport business employee experience as products themselves (a philosophy driven by Katie Burke and Hubspot - thanks, Bates volleyball co-captain), we can draw from sport. Karen and I tackle regimented rest and recovery and beyond in this fun Friday conversation. Thanks, Karen!\n\nMy Sports Business Journal subscribers, check out this week's issue for my take on women in sport analytics. Would our customer retention model variables be different with more women on analytics teams? Would results be more effective? Click the link for why representation matters from a sport business perspective.\n\nGreat conversation with Kristof De Mey regarding the natural language processing how, when, and why in North American professional sport, a research project exploring vast NLP use cases and diffusion timing - sponsored by the Ohio University College of Business. Looking forward to advancing the Global Sports Tech Research Network. The future of sport business is tech - SportTechie, Annie Valeant, Michael Naraine, Ph.D, Adrien Bouchet, Chad Seifried\n\nThanks, Aaron Morse, for the invitation to participate in the Bates Greats podcast series, honoring former Bates student-athletes. From a top 20 liberal arts school to top 20 in the world, only now am I realizing that my athletic experience was a template for my pursuit of professional goals today. #NESCAC #Bates #GoBatesBobcats! https://lnkd.in/eSumcj8"
