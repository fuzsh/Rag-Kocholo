        "text": "Three re-elected Escambia County commissioners, Jeff Bergosh, Lumon May and Steven Barry, were sworn-in Tuesday for their next four-year terms on the county's board of county commissioners.\n\nBergosh started his second term in office while Barry and May began their third terms in office.\n\nThe ceremony was held on the field of Blue Wahoos Stadium while the audience sat in the stands to be able to spread out and practice social distancing.\n\nTuesday's ceremony also marked the County Commission changing chairmanship as the gavel was passed from Barry to Commissioner Robert Bender. Bender was elected in 2018 and will hold the leadership position on the board for the first time.\n\nBergosh: Jeff Bergosh fends off 3 challengers, retains Escambia County Commission District 1 seat\n\nMay: Lumon May defeats brother LuTimothy in landslide victory\n\nBarry: Steven Barry wins third term as District 5 Escambia County Commissioner\n\nThe leadership position is rotated each year among the commissioners, and its power is mainly limited to the role of running commission meetings.\n\nBender said he was looking forward to the next year as chairman of the commission.\n\n\"We have a lot of big projects coming up, other than just the day-to-day things that we do,\" Bender said. \"We have some redistricting to do as we continue recovering from Hurricane Sally and COVID. I look forward to working with the city and also negotiating a new sheriff's contract with Sheriff (Chip) Simmons.\"\n\nBarry was sworn-in by Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Frydrychowicz, and May took his oath from Circuit Court Judge Thomas Dannheisser.\n\nBergosh had the unique position of being sworn-in by his brother, Circuit Court Judge Gary Bergosh.\n\nOnce the commissioners were sworn-in, Escambia County Clerk and Comptroller Pam Childers read their commission from Gov. Ron DeSantis to serve on the board of county commissioners.\n\nEach of the three commissioners faced virtually no opposition during the general election, though May had a write-in opponent who did not campaign for the position.\n\nAll three commissioners faced challenges for their party's nomination for the position during the primaries earlier this year.\n\nNew school superintendent: No more excuses. New Escambia County school superintendent wants to close achievement gap\n\nEyesore hotel: Escambia County to tear down abandoned eyesore hotel overlooking I-110 for $180,000\n\nMay faced a challenge for the Democratic Party nomination for District 3 from his own brother LuTimothy May.\n\nDuring the ceremony, May thanked his family for standing by him during the campaign.\n\n\"Whenever you decide to run for office, it's not just you running, it's your entire family,\" May said. \"It's the good, bad and the horrific things that are said. The painful things that you bear, you don't bear alone. You bear it with your family.\"\n\nBarry fended off a challenge for the Republican nomination for District 5 taking a majority of votes against challengers Megan Walters and former Commissioner John Reading.\n\nBarry also thanked his family, stopping several times during his remarks as he was overcome by emotion.\n\n\"These are very stressful positions on your family,\" Barry said. \"Sometimes we feel that people are talking bad about us and saying things about us. But at least we always have an opportunity to have a forum to respond. ... Our spouses, our children, they don't have the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nBergosh won the most votes in his race for the Republican nomination for District 1, beating out three other candidates including a challenge from District 2 Commissioner Doug Underhill's staff aide Jonathan Owens.\n\nBergosh too thanked his family for their support and thanked those who donated to his campaign. He said despite 2020 being one of the worst years, he believes 2021 will be a great year for Escambia County.\n\n\"Things will get better,\" Bergosh said. \"We will get past this virus. We will move forward. Our economy will recover and right here in Escambia County, as a kid that grew up here, our best days are ahead of us.\"\n\nJim Little can be reached at jwlittle@pnj.com and 850-208-9827."
