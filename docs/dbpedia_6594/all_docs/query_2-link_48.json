        "text": "Bobby Hurley does not know exactly when his brother ceased to celebrate the NCAA championship for which he had worked, in some form or other, his entire life. His joy definitely was not contained to the half-hour or so beyond the court, because Dan Hurley smiled grandly in the Connecticut locker room at Houston’s Reliant Stadium last April as he talked about what his Huskies had achieved.\n\nBeyond that stood the challenge of the 2023-24 season, though, which meant any time spent lingering at parties and parades was not time invested into fashioning a roster that could make a serious attempt at finishing a second consecutive season as Division I college basketball’s No. 1 team.\n\nWinning two of these in a row is not merely repeating, it is making history. And that is very much a Hurley thing.\n\n“His mindset just flipped pretty quick,” Bobby Hurley told The Sporting News. “He didn’t take a lot of time to savor the victory. He got right back to work. Any time the season ends and you’re the last team standing, it’s such a great feeling, but immediately he had to figure out which of his players were going to turn pro, which of his players might go into the transfer portal, who does he need to bring in to replace those types of players? And all that happens really quick in our world now.”\n\nSN's MARCH MADNESS HQ\n\nLive NCAA bracket news | TV schedule | Printable PDF\n\nWhen you are a Hurley who chooses to enter the family business, there always is a resource available to consult with on the issue of the day. Bob Hurley Sr. won 26 New Jersey state championships as a high school coach, and more than a few of them were in a row. But Bobby is one of the rare players in NCAA history to conquer March Madness in consecutive seasons.\n\nObviously, every year since the conclusion of the first tournament in 1939, someone was in position to attempt a repeat. Only seven programs in the nine decades of the NCAA Tournament have done it: Oklahoma State, Kentucky, San Francisco, Cincinnati, UCLA, Duke and Florida, which completed the deal in 2007. That means it’s been 17 years, nearly as long as the time between the last of the Bruins’ seven straight titles, in 1973, and Duke’s second in a row, in 1992. Connecticut has the opportunity to join that remarkable list and, better yet, it has the potential.\n\n“We didn’t go into a lot of conversations about that. I think he always knew that we were the target, so I think that would be something immediately that Dan would know,” Bobby told TSN. “It wears you down to go through a season where, all of a sudden, you’re everybody’s Super Bowl, so I’m sure they’ve had to go through that in their conference schedule.\n\n“When you’re the returning champ and projected to be a top team again, you’re on everybody’s radar.”\n\nIt has not appeared to wear on the Huskies. They have only grown more dominant as the season advanced. After lacking key starters for a month of non-conference play (freshman wing Steph Castle) and then just as Big East play was accelerating (center Donovan Clingan), the team grew deeper with reserve players temporarily embracing greater roles and excelling within them.\n\nThe coaching staff was disappointed Castle missed some early buy games that would have allowed him to gain comfort, but in exchange freshman Solomon Ball played way more minutes than planned and performed well enough to gain the trust of his coaches. With Clingan gone, backup Samson Johnson became the starter and brought an elite level of power and dynamism to the center spot he’d not gotten the opportunity to demonstrate because of the team’s depth his first two seasons.\n\nAnd now they’ve lost only once in this calendar year, and only seven of their 20 victories in that period came by fewer than 10 points.\n\nWhat is different from what Florida accomplished in 2006 and 2007, what Duke did in 1991 and 1992, and what UConn is attempting to achieve now, is that this is largely a different team. Point guard Tristen Newton and power forward Alex Karaban were in the lineup against San Diego State last April and Clingan was coming off the bench, but after that game, the Huskies lost 75 percent of their scoring as Andre Jackson, Jordan Hawkins, Adama Sanogo and Joey Calcaterra were among those who completed their college careers.\n\nNot since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar completed his career in 1969 and UCLA then won with Sidney Wicks as the biggest star, and then Wicks finished up in 1971 and was succeeded by Bill Walton in 1972 and 1973, has there been such a vast transformation in a championship team. And even then, John Wooden never lost more than 63 percent of his scoring from year to year. That’s how remarkable it is, what Dan Hurley is trying to conjure here.\n\n“I think you just get a core, and you kind of harden the team. He was able to bring that core back with Newton and Clingan and Karaban,” Bobby said. “And then you just kind of build out from there. He had a formula for success, and he identified the appropriate guys to bring in to supplement what they had.\n\n“When you have those kinds of guys and are bringing in the right players, that’s the plan Dan had.”\n\nEXPERT PICKS: DeCourcy (UConn) | Bender (UConn) | Iyer (UConn) | Yanchulis (South Carolina women)\n\n---\n\nNo team that repeated as champions faced the same sort of decisions as the Florida Gators did in 2006. Their championship conveyed opportunities that were not common when Duke earned its consecutive titles years earlier.\n\nIn 1991, entering the draft was something exclusive to the most NBA-ready prospects, such as Georgia Tech point guard Kenny Anderson. If a player wasn’t likely to be selected among the very first choices and thus sign a huge entry contract, he stayed until that was possible. Even Shaquille O’Neal returned for a third college season in 1991-92.\n\nIt was a different world that Joakim Noah and his teammates conquered. The NBA’s rookie salary cap had removed that incentive to cash in big as a top-3 pick, and so players were choosing the draft at earlier ages, with less experience. Noah was not a perfect prospect, but with his combination of team orientation, energy and dynamism, he was viewed as a potentially elite defensive center and projected as a potential first overall pick.\n\nRepeat Champions since 1985 Team Years Florida 2006-07 Duke 1991-92\n\nAnd he stayed at Florida. And so did power forward Al Horford and small forward Corey Brewer and point guard Taurean Green. Shooting guard Lee Humphrey always planned to play as a senior. So the Florida Gators went after a second title with the same coach, Billy Donovan, and the exact same five. No other program ever had done this.\n\n“Whenever Taurean and Corey decided to come back, Jo and Al said they were coming back, too. They were like a package deal,” Humphrey told TSN. “I remember the first championship, before we ever won it, after the Elite Eight game we were standing in the hallway about to go into the press conference. And Coach Donovan said, ‘You guys have a chance to do something really special.’ It was kind of foreshadowing, I think, the run we were about to make.”\n\nThe psychology of pursuing a second championship is vastly different. There always is that little temptation, like the one for a regular citizen to take that extra cookie, not to push through the discomfort or fatigue in a particular moment with the same zeal that led to the initial title. The obvious rationalization: I already have one.\n\nDonovan worked against that by consulting with the noted sports sociologist Dr. Harry Edwards and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who’d had the experience just a few years earlier of leading his team to Lombardi Trophies in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\"Everyone goes about it differently in terms of preparing your team,” Donovan told TSN. “But the one commonality is all the guys I talked to were convicted on how they wanted their team to approach it. And there is a lot of ways you can approach it.\n\n“The distractions are real. Guys have to understand that everyone is going to have an opinion. ‘UConn is going to win six straight games.’ ‘No one is going to touch them.’ Everybody is going to say what is or isn’t going to happen. There is going to be a lot of stuff, and they have to understand that the only thing that matters is what takes place between the lines.\n\n“I told Danny this story that I told my Florida team: Do you know what they do as soon as the final game is over at the national championship? They rope the court off. No one is allowed in there. You celebrate with your teammates and your coaches. You better section yourselves off now, because when you go there and you win, they section the court off, and it will be just you celebrating in there. And everyone else is going to be on the outside looking in.”\n\nEven with the starting five intact, and the frontcourt deepened with the development of big man Marreese Speights, the Gators did not follow a direct line to the championship. They were 24-2 on Valentine’s Day, 2007 and loving life. That they next lost a road game at Vanderbilt seemed no cause for concern, because they clinched the SEC regular-season title with a victory at South Carolina four days later.\n\nAnd then what seemed a blip at Vandy turned into a slide. With defeats on the road against LSU and Kentucky, it added up to three losses in four games.\n\n“One of the biggest strengths of our team was we always played with joy and just excitement – glad to be out there playing together was really the mentality we had,” Humphrey said. “We never really thought we were going to lose going into games. At that point in the season, we had already clinched … so I think there was a bit of a letdown from that. We weren’t playing the same way we did together. We got into a rut where we weren’t moving the ball. We didn’t have the same team chemistry.\n\n“I think we realized we were losing what we had. It was a wake-up call for us. And we got super-hot in the SEC Tournament and started crushing teams. I think that catapulted us into the NCAA Tournament.”\n\nSo, who’s got it and who doesn’t, regardless of seed, ranking, or Vegas odds?\n\nREGION-BY-REGION GUIDES: South | Midwest | West | East\n\n----\n\nDerek Anderson scored two points in the 1997 NCAA Tournament. Kentucky played six games that year, as it did the year before and the year after, but their best player appeared only briefly. And those two free throws Anderson attempted were a perfect symbol of why the Wildcats did not win each of the three championship games it entered in that stretch.\n\nKentucky won the NCAA title with relative comfort in 1996, and it scraped and gutted its way to another championship in 1998. What could have been the greatest dynasty in the expanded bracket era, though, was interrupted on a January Saturday at Rupp Arena, when the Wildcats were in the process of wrecking Auburn in an SEC game. Anderson, an All-America candidate, injured his knee in the second half and subsequently was discovered to have torn his ACL.\n\nAt their next game, against Vanderbilt at Cincinnati’s Riverfront Coliseum, Pitino made it clear the ambition to win a second straight title remained intact even if Anderson’s knee ligament did not.\n\nAnd they almost got it done.\n\n“Coach P doesn’t change much. I’m not saying he hasn’t changed over time, but he didn’t treat the ’97 team any differently than he did the ’96 team. The expectations were the same,” Cameron Mills, a standout shooter during those seasons, told The Sporting News. “There was no less pressure put on us to do the same things the ’96 team did.\n\n“He comes in and does everything consistently, so that even if you win a game – for example, we beat Georgia my freshman year at home by, I think, 12. We led them the whole game by that, but then they cut it with maybe a 6-0 run, maybe a 4-0 run. And he calls a timeout and just reams us. There’s like 3 minutes left, and we end up going back on a run. We get in the locker room, and he writes 12:01 up on the blackboard. And he says, ‘You all be there.’ And we have a 3-hour practice at midnight. Even though we won, we did not, in his words, ‘deserve victory.’\n\n“It doesn’t matter what level of team he has, it is consistent, it is the same.”\n\nThis was true after the Anderson injury occurred. The Wildcats had to get by without one of their best defenders, a future NBA first-round pick who averaged 17.7 points and 3.5 assists. The Wildcats won 14 of their final 16 games without him, claiming the SEC Tournament title and entering the NCAAs as a No. 1 seed.\n\nOnce in March Madness, UK won the first five games by an average of 16 points but fell to Arizona in the final game by five points in overtime. Honestly, it was a result more impressive than a lot of tournament champions have delivered.\n\n“Coach P did not miss a beat. You didn’t see any added frustration on his face in practice because Derek was down. When that first happened, I don’t know if he had any confidence that I was going to be able to do what I did. But there wasn’t this anger. It wasn’t, there goes our season because one of our two big stars is down. Look, he rages on the sideline and he rages in practice. But it’s consistent. You know when it’s coming. You know it’s always there, whether you’re winning by 20 or whether you’re not. It’s going to be there, because what matters more is: Did we deserve victory?\n\n“We had the pressure of repeating, but we had the expectations ourselves. Because our coach coached us that we were going to repeat … I don’t think he ever addressed the prospects of repeating. He addressed the prospects of: OK, new season, we’ve got one goal.”\n\nThe team thrived as Wayne Turner became a second player and as Mills blossomed in a role off the bench. In the six NCAA games, he shot 68.6 percent from the field and averaged 11.8 points, reaching double figures in all but one game.\n\nWhen Anderson knew he would not play regularly again, he still wished to suit up for the Final Four. He requested Pitino trust him with any technical foul shots the team might earn. He could not run or cut, but he could shoot standing still. And before the semifinal against Minnesota had concluded with a 78-69 UK victory, official Jim Burr called a technical foul against Gophers coach Clem Haskins. Anderson got his moment, made both shots.\n\nHe did not get a second ring, however.\n\nYou often will hear competitors – athletes and coaches – say they hate losing more than they love winning. Many of the Wildcats of that period, including Mills, Turner and Allen Edwards – joined the rare group of players who won multiple titles. They could have won three in a row, though. So does that hurt linger more than the glory of winning it twice in three years?\n\n“Here’s the thing I think about: If we win in ’97, that doesn’t guarantee we win in ’98,” Mills said. “Because winning in ’97 might change a whole bunch of things that losing that year allowed to happen.”\n\n---\n\nOn the way to another Final Four and what seemed to be an inevitable repeat, coach Jerry Tarkanian’s 1990-91 UNLV Runnin’ Rebels won 34 games by an average of 27.6 points. Only Arkansas, with Final Four veterans Todd Day and Lee Mayberry, and Georgetown, with the twin towers of Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning, managed to lose by single-digit margins.\n\nWhich is not to say anything about the year was easy.\n\n“We dealt with a lot of extenuating and external factors, in terms of how the NCAA interacted and dealt with us and the program and Coach,” Greg Anthony, the Rebels’ star point guard in that period, told The Sporting News. “We had other areas that were kind of able to bring us together.”\n\nUNLV – more to the point, Tarkanian – was fighting through an NCAA investigation of the program for years when the organization finally determined it would ban the Rebels from the 1991 postseason. Ultimately, it was agreed the program would be banned from the postseason (and television) in 1991-92, and Anthony, Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon and Anderson Hunt would be able to take their best shots at winning two in a row.\n\nThey were all in on coming back for that season, even though Johnson could have been a prominent NBA Draft pick and Augmon not terribly far behind him. Anthony explained the players all understood they never would enjoy quite the same experience once they separated and became professionals and embraced the experience of attempting to achieve something extraordinary.\n\n“It was just a different time. You didn’t have the rush to get to the next step the way you do now, to speed up the process,” Anthony said. “We were just in a completely different place in terms of a society. We had the best player in the country in Larry, and he was going to go No. 1 in the draft whether he left that year or the next year. And for him to be comfortable coming back made it a lot easier for all of us.”\n\nAs the season developed, it became common to compare UNLV to college basketball’s greatest teams – mostly whichever dynastic UCLA squad one favored. The Rebels were that dominant. They also didn’t play the most invigorating schedule. Big West rival New Mexico State had a terrific team, and there was that early February trip to Arkansas. There were only five total games against top 25 opponents.\n\n“A season is always challenging. It’s just the nature of when you’re bringing together that many people and you’re fighting for a common goal,” Anthony said. “We were defending champs. We were really good. And we were really excited to go out and play. We all loved playing. We loved being in college. We were in a city where we felt loved. We were kind of the biggest thing going in Las Vegas at that time. And so to have that experience, it can also be very nurturing.\n\n“Even though we did feel it was us against the world in a lot of ways, when we were home, we had the support and had an infrastructure that gave us comfort and familiarity and confidence.”\n\nSo it was a magical experience, until the evening of March 30 at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis, a night that showed just how hard it is to do this once, let alone twice in a row. Because the Duke team the Rebels had blown out a year earlier, the 30-point margin still standing as the greatest disparity in the NCAA Championship game history, wasn’t really the same team now. Bobby Hurley was healthy after playing the previous year’s final with some sort of illness. The supremely talented Grant Hill had joined the program.\n\nThe Rebels and Blue Devils contested a game whose memory is magical for all but those who played for or supported UNLV. The final score was 79-77. The game turned on an audacious 3-pointer by Hurley that sliced into a 5-point UNLV lead with a little more than 2 minutes left, then was clinched on two late free throws by Duke star Christian Laettner.\n\n“We knew they were going to be a really good team. And we also knew – the thing about sports, when you get to that level, nobody’s 30 points better,” Anthony said. “We were well aware it would be a different game the next time around. And having said all of that, it was a one-possession game. I can make the case: We didn’t play our best, they played really well and they deserved to win. That’s the beauty of sports.\n\n“While it was really frustrating and disappointing, I at least had the opportunity to win a national championship, to be a part of history. In the moment, it doesn’t feel any better when you lose, it would feel a lot worse had you not had the opportunity to experience the sheer joy of being crowned a national champion.”\n\n----\n\nOf all the thoughts and statements shared with the public over more than 40 years as a high-major basketball coach, the one that always has stood out as particularly insightful was Mike Krzyzewski's refusal to allow his players to refer to themselves as ‘defending champions.’ ”\n\n“I think from my military career, at West Point, we were taught – I call it ‘next play’. You have to be in the moment. You can look back on moments or look ahead to moments. You have to be in the moment. Words are powerful, because when they become your words they lead to either action or inaction.\n\n“So after we won in ’91, and at that time guys came back. I knew we would have a chance. I wanted to flip the page real quick. And everyone in the world uses ‘defend’. And I just said, we need to forget about defend. How can anyone take that away from us? It’s really not a word that’s used right. What, are you going to come and steal our trophy? We’ll get another one.”\n\nThat’s why you’ll hear particular sports journalists refer now to the 2023-24 UConn Huskies as “reigning” champions.\n\nYou can repeat, though. There’s no way around that language, and there’s no way around the attempt unless a program wants to take the year off and celebrate their championship for the entire year. No one has, yet. Because there is something extraordinary about being able to fight through the distractions and the questions about winning two in a row and the opposition trying to validate their own season by beating the team that is not so far removed from winning it all.\n\nThe 1991-92 Duke team had plenty to manage beyond the excellent teams they faced in the Atlantic Coast Conference and, eventually, the NCAAs. Their success the prior year made not just basketball stars of Laettner and Bobby Hurley, but teen-idol style celebrities. The two of them occasionally appeared to clash on the court. Duke continued to win, though, dropping a couple games only after Hurley was injured in February.\n\n“We just tried to stay locked in and focused on what we were doing. We all challenged each other, held a very high standard,” Bobby Hurley said. “Myself, Grant Hill, Christian all were internally like there was competition to keep getting better, and there was accountability to that. I think the one underrated thing about winning it is you know how to win it. It elevates your confidence to a different place. I worked a lot harder that summer because I knew that I would be targeted. I got a taste of what it was like to win a championship, and we all wanted to do it again. It drove us to do more, to work harder.\n\n“I think that’s one thing for Dan, going into a season, he knows how to do it. He knows what it takes as a coach to do it. And that puts you in a different position. There are a lot of people who haven’t done it who are wondering if they can do it.”\n\nThe 1991-92 Duke team was not as dominant as the UNLV team they vanquished the previous year, but the Devils were powerful enough. They won by an average of 16 points. They featured six players who eventually would earn an NBA paycheck, four of whom were first-round selections.\n\nAnd still they wound up in overtime against Kentucky in the East Region final, trailing by a point with 2.1 seconds left after a magnificent shot by Wildcats guard Sean Woods had cleared Laettner’s outstretched arms and given his team a one-point lead. It looked like the dream of repeating was over. That’s how fragile it can be.\n\nAnd then came Hill to Laettner to the bottom of the net. And the dream continued on to Minneapolis, where it was realized with a second-half splurge that defeated Michigan’s Fab Five freshmen.\n\n“We had developed such a strong internal will to win and belief,” Bobby Hurley said. “Even in those type of moments when it does not appear that you have a very good chance to win, you have enough talent and coaching and championship pedigree to figure out a way to do it.”\n\nKrzyzewski sees that same quality in Danny Hurley, whom he calls a good friend. Recruiting Bobby back in the late 1980s led Krzyzewski to an enduring relationship with the entire Hurley family.\n\n“They’re a family that pursues, and I love watching Danny and his team, how he’s on to the next thing,” Krzyzewski said. “I admire what he’s done this year. They have a chance. A good chance. But it started not a month ago. It started right after they won.”"
