The awards dinner is a program of The Charlie Daniels Journey Home Project, a 501c3 that supports military veterans, first responders and their families. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the program, co-founded by Country Music legend, Charlie Daniels with his longtime manager, David Corlew. Although Daniels passed in 2020, his musical legacy lives on, and his devotion to veterans causes continues through the dedication of Corlew. Through fundraising events, the organization supports the efforts of other not-for-profit organizations providing services to U.S. veterans and first responders; selected for providing the most meaningful work with the lowest overhead. TCHJHP has raised more than $4 million for these organizations. Corlew shares his story of how he got into the business, first working at a record store, then becoming a roadie for Charlie Daniels, before becoming his manager for the next 30+ years of Charlie’s career.

Are they (the artist) still viable? Is the cost (and the unpredictable weather when its outdoors) worth going to stand around with hopefully thousands of your closest friends in a partially filled event? Jack and Bob delve into why some acts should no longer find themselves anticipating performing at large venues, when its difficult to put butts in the seats, and the scaling back to smaller venues such as auditoriums or theaters (or clubs) might make more financial sense.... in spite of their egos. Wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts. #musicpodcast #musicbusiness #musicindustry #musictour\n\nWe’ve had some amazing guests on The Business Side of Music Podcast over the years, covering all topics of conversation regarding the music business.

Will AI replace the live performance? The artist who’s seeking a record deal? Is this the beginning of the end as we know it, or is it the end of the beginning?
