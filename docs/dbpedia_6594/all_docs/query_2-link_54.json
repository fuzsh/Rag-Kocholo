        "text": "Following their remarkable 3-2 come-from-behind victory over Charlie Smith on Wednesday, Camperdown's head coach, Christopher Bender, believes that his team now stands a chance of reaching the semi-finals of the ISSA/Digicel Manning Cup competition.\n\nCamperdown, who last made it to semi-finals in 2014, stormed back from two goals down at half-time to stun Charlie Smith at the Stadium East Field.\n\nThe victory has moved Camperdown to the top of Group H with three points. They are followed by Kingston College and St George's College, who are both on one point following their 0-0 draw, also on Wednesday at the same venue.\n\nBender, who was a member of the Camperdown team, which last won the competition in 1982, said that his players are very confident and upbeat and that they are dreaming of a spot in the semi-finals of the competition.\n\nMAIN FOCUS\n\n\"My focus is on the game on Saturday (tomorrow), and, hopefully, we can go there and play St George's College and get the result that we desire,\" said Bender.\n\n\"A win will put us through to the semi-finals, and once that objective is achieved, then we will be happy,\" he said. \"But we are not going to get ahead of ourselves, and so we will keep the players' feet on the ground, and once we achieve that result on Saturday, then it will be a big achievement for us,\" Bender said.\n\nHe added that many of persons did not expect his team to reach this far in the competition, but he was always confident that his players would have done well this season.\n\n\"We were the unnoticed team in the zone with the least quality, but that didn't worry us at all. I keep telling them [to] stay focused and keep the commitment because the result will be a consequence of your performance on the day,\" said Bender.\n\n\"We are excited about this, but that excitement only lasted for yesterday (Wednesday) because we are now thinking about the game on Saturday and so the work starts all over again in terms of our preparations for this game against St George's,\" Bender said."
