        "text": "Jon set out to create a place where he could be his genuine self. The first step was to find the right space. A gritty laneway location in Verity Lane ticked many of Jon’s boxes.\n\n“I saw potential. The timber floors, high ceilings, the location, and the fact that it had character already.”\n\nThe Tourism Product Development Fund\n\nA grant from the Tourism Product Development Fund allowed Jon to engage local builders.\n\n“We used the money to stay local and keep the money in town. That was part of our agreement with the builder that we went with, that they weren’t going to subcontract out of town,” he said.\n\nThe principle of supporting local has stuck with Jon. It extends to the Squeaky Clean menu, which showcases local suppliers and producers. The burgers have quickly become a favourite among regulars. They feature beef from Southland’s Quality Meats and buns from Three Mills.\n\n“They’re local and they look after us. It’s that relationship thing – building relationships with people where we both keep the money in town,” Jon said.\n\nHow to apply\n\nThe Tourism Product Development Fund supports local businesses to provide better visitor experiences. This helps:\n\nboost the local economy\n\ncreate jobs\n\nenhance Canberra’s reputation as a tourism destination.\n\nApplications for the Tourism Product Development Fund are now open."
