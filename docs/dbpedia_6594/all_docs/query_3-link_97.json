        "text": "They've existed for more than 1,000 years and have affected warfare — and society in general — in ways perhaps no other invention can match. We're talking about guns.\n\nOnce just the weapon of the world's military forces, guns are now considered a right of the average citizen by some people, especially in the United States, where it's written into the Constitution. So, when were guns invented?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Invention of Gunpowder\n\nIt all started in China around 850 C.E., when Chinese alchemists accidentally created gunpowder while trying to develop a \"fountain of youth\" potion. The resulting black powder, called \"huo yao,\" was a blend of charcoal, saltpeter and sulfur.\n\nThe then-reigning Song Dynasty was the first to have used gunpowder in warfare; they did so against the Mongols, whose constant invasions into the country plagued the Chinese throughout the period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe First Guns\n\nThe Chinese attacked the Mongols with fire lances or \"flying fire\" — arrows fixed with tubes of gunpowder that, when ignited, would propel across enemy lines.\n\nMore gunpowder-based weapons followed as the Chinese perfected a variety of weapons against the Mongols over the next centuries, including the first cannons and grenades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGunpowder Arrives in Europe\n\nGunpowder made its way to Europe in the 13th century, likely over the Silk Road trade route through Central Asia. Rival nations refined gunpowder recipes in the ensuing centuries before arriving at the optimal mixture: approximately 75 percent saltpeter, 15 percent charcoal and 10 percent sulfur.\n\nBy 1350, rudimentary gunpowder cannons were commonplace in the English and French militaries, who used the explosive technology against each other during the Hundred Years' War. As the centuries continued, new and improved cannons were designed, many of which were small and portable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hand Cannon\n\nEventually, the hand cannon was developed in the early 15th century; it was the first real personal firearm. The Ottoman Turks used these and other cannons during the successful siege of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nThe powerful new weapons essentially rendered traditional walled fortifications of Europe defenseless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvention of the Modern Handgun\n\nHistorians generally consider the Chinese fire lance as the first gun. But before the 15th century, these early guns were tricky to fire — they required both hands and a burning wick to ignite the powder.\n\nDevelopment of the Matchlock\n\nEnter the invention of the lock, an internal firing mechanism that made shooting a hand-held firearm more efficient, easier and safer. The first was a matchlock, followed by a series of enhancements until we get something more akin to the guns we know today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first known gun to use a matchlock was the 15th-century French arquebus, a short-barreled long gun (rifle) held at the shoulder yet small enough to be handled by one person. A gunpowder-soaked cord in an S-shaped arm burned at both ends until it touched a flash powder pan, sending a small ball soaring toward its enemy.\n\nDespite their greater accuracy, they were cumbersome weapons that required at least two minutes between firings.\n\nImpact of Early Guns\n\nGuns slowly replaced old-guard weapons because they were more economical rather than more lethal. Becoming a highly skilled (and highly paid) swordsman or archer required lifelong devotion, but a few weeks or months of training could turn a lower-class soldier into a capable gunner.\n\nBesides increasing the field of soldiers, guns have had a far-reaching influence on the nature of armed combat, from the distances at which dueling armies engage one another to the types of wounds soldiers incur. In military technology, only the horse — which dominated battlefields for millennia — has proven more important to modern warfare than the gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirearm Innovations\n\nThe Chinese fire-spurting lances are a far cry from the guns used today. Here's how some of the best known modern guns came to be.\n\nRevolvers\n\nRevolvers are pistols that can fire multiple bullets without reloading. Although the basic design dates back to the 17th century, revolvers only took off when Samuel Colt produced his version in 1835.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColt used interchangeable parts to manufacture his firearms, which helped his pistols become the most widely used in the U.S. Civil War (1861–65).\n\nMachine Guns\n\nDuring the U.S. Civil War, soldiers used an early machine gun known as a Gatling gun. Invented in 1862 by Richard Jordan Gatling, the Gatling gun used a hand-crank mechanism to shoot rapid-fire.\n\nThe invention of smokeless gunpowder led to the development of the Maxim gun by Hiram Maxim in 1884. Unlike hand-cranked Gatling guns, Maxim guns were recoil-operated and famously used in conflicts including the Spanish-American War (1898) and the South African Boer War (1899–1902).\n\nMaxim-style guns remained popular during both World Wars, but the assault rifle eventually replaced them.\n\nAssault Rifles\n\nAssault rifles can switch between automatic and semiautomatic firing. German inventor Hugo Schmeisser developed the first assault rifle during World War II, the \"sturmgewehr\" (“assault rifle”) 44.\n\nLater in the Second World War, Russian inventor Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov developed the now-famous AK-47. (AK stands for “automatic Kalashnikov.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst Gun FAQ\n\nWhat was the first gun ever made?\n\nThe Chinese fire lance, a bamboo tube (or metal tube) that used gunpowder to fire a spear, invented in the 10th century, is regarded by historians as the first gun ever made. Gunpowder was previously invented in China in the 9th century.\n\nWhat did the first gun look like?\n\nThe earliest gun, the Chinese fire lance, had a gunpowder-filled tube (normally bamboo) attached to a spear. When ignited, the tube projected flames and added shrapnel such as pottery shards at the target.\n\nWhen did the British army start using guns?\n\nRifles fully replaced the musket as military weapons in the late 19th century. The first order to build 1,000 rifles for the British Army was made in January, 1776. A pattern by a gunsmith, William Grice, was approved for official issue.\n\nWho brought gunpowder to Europe?\n\nThe information about how to make gunpowder spread quickly throughout Asia, the Middle East and Europe as a result of the Mongol conquests. But gunpowder was first brought to Europe in the 13th century, possibly by traders, over the Silk Road trade routes through central Asia.\n\nWhat was the first fully automatic gun?\n\nThe Maxim machine gun was the first fully automatic machine gun. It was developed by an engineer and inventor, Hiram Maxim, in 1884 in England. This automatic gun was also known as the Vickers-Maxim or just Vickers.\n\nLots More Information\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSources\n\nAmmunitiondepot.com. \"Gun History: When Was the First Gun Made?\" (Aug. 31, 2021) https://www.ammunitiondepot.com/blog/gun-history-when-was-the-first-gun-made\n\nBritannica.com. \"Harquebus.\" (Aug. 31, 2021) https://www.britannica.com/technology/harquebus\n\nBritannica.com. \"Machine gun.\" (Sep. 13, 2023) https://www.britannica.com/technology/machine-gun\n\nKit Meng, Leon. \"Appendix C: Notes on Huo Yao (Fire Drug) or Gunpowder.\" Chinese Siege Warfare: Mechanical Artillery and Siege Weapons of Antiquity. 2005.
