        "text": "Queen Nazli’s story: part I – Nazli Sabry’s lineage\n\nQueen Nazli Sabri of Egypt was born on 25 June 1894 in Alexandria, Egypt, into an aristocratic French/Turkish lineage. She was born to Abdur Rahim Sabri Pasha, an influential figure who held the positions of Egyptian Minister of Agriculture and Governor of Cairo. Queen Nazli’s upbringing was undoubtedly shaped by the distinguished roles and careers of her ancestors.\n\nThe traits that defined Queen Nazli — her indomitable spirit, resilience, yearning for equality, and love for freedom – were perhaps rooted in her maternal lineage.\n\nNazli’s mother was Tawfika Khanum Sharif\n\nTawfika’s mother was Nazli al-Faransawi, a daughter of the renowned adventurer Soliman Pasha al-Faransawi, you can read his story here. This notable figure is commemorated with a statue within the Egyptian National Military Museum in the Citadel of Saladin in Cairo, as well as a bust at the Préfecture in Lyon, France.\n\nQueen Nazli’s Grandfather: Muhammad Cherif Pasha\n\nNazli’s grandfather on her mother’s side, the husband of Nazli al-Faransawi, was Muhammad Cherif Pasha, a descendant of the Ashraf family from Hijaz, he was a prominent figure in Egypt during the 19th century. Born in 1828 in Muhammad Ali’s hometown of Kavala, and passing away in 1887, his legacy is closely tied to his role in shaping Egypt’s political landscape.\n\nCherif Pasha’s significance lies in his authorship of Egypt’s inaugural Constitution. This document marked a pivotal moment in Egypt’s history, as it bestowed the parliament with exclusive legislative authority for the very first time. His decision to present this Constitution to the parliament was a groundbreaking move, reinforcing the foundations of modern Egyptian governance.\n\nCherif Pasha served as Egypt’s prime minister on four separate occasions, spanning from 1866 to 1884. His final term, however, ended on a note of dissent. He resigned from his post in protest against Egypt’s decision to relinquish control over Sudan due to mounting pressure from the British Empire. This principled stance exemplified his commitment to Egyptian sovereignty.\n\nBeyond his political career, Cherif Pasha had a noteworthy educational background. He was part of the fourth student mission sent to Paris, where he likely gained valuable insights into governance and political philosophy. Additionally, he played a crucial role in founding the Helwan Club, an organization that later evolved into the influential al-Watan party in Egyptian politics.\n\nSadly, n 28 Feb 2011 the mausoleum of Muhammad Cherif Pasha in Cairo was looted. Full story here\n\nEgypt’s Museums XVIV: The Mohamed Cherif Pasha mausoleum\n\nQueen Nazli: her siblings\n\nEminah Abdel Rehem Sabry (1908 – 1925): younger sister of Queen Nazli\n\nin 1924 18 year-old Amina married 28 year old Prince Adil Djimil Tousson, grandson of Tewfik Pasha, great grandson of Ismail the Magnificent, great-great-grandson of Ibrahim Pasha and great, great, great grandson of Muhammad Ali. Tragedy hit a year later when 19 year old Amina died shortly after giving birth their child. I cannot find any trace of the child so I am assuming he/she died at birth.\n\nSherif Sabri Pasha: younger (by one year) brother of Queen Nazli, born in Cairo in 1895, was a notable figure in Egypt’s history.\n\nDuring a crucial period in 1936-37 when King Farouk I was still a minor, Sherif Pasha Sabri played a significant role as a member of the three-member Regency Council. At that time, Sherif Pasha Sabri was 41 years old and had previously served as the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, showcasing his experience in government affairs.\n\nSherif Pasha Sabri received his education at the Khedivial School of Law in Cairo. He was not only known for his political contributions but also for his leadership in various organizations. Notably, from May 1946 to March 1955, he served as the head of the Royal Egyptian Geographic Society.\n\nPositions held by Sherif Sabri Pasha:\n\nDirector-General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1925-1929).\n\nUnder-Secretary of State (1929-1933).\n\nEnvoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (1933-1936).\n\nMember of the Regency Council (1936-1937).\n\nPresident of the Royal Egyptian Geographic Society (1946-1955).\n\nPresident of the Supreme Council of the Arab Museum., now known as the Islamic Museum\n\nPresident of Egyptian Shipping Company.\n\nPresident of Egyptian Construction and Engineering Company.\n\nPresident of Nile Insurance Company.\n\nHussein Abdel Rehim Sabry – Queen Nazli’s brother\n\nHussein was married to Chahira Abbas al-Daramali – they had four children.\n\nQueen Nazli’s Education:\n\nNazli Abdel Rehim Sabry first attended the Lycée de la Mère de Dieu School in Cairo, and later to Notre Dame de Sion in Alexandria. According to everything written about Nazli – when her mother, Tewfika Hanem, died on 24 October 1915, her father sent 21 year old Nazli and her 7 year old sister, Eminah, to Paris, France for two years. I find this rather odd, who did they go to and why?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nQueen Nazli of Egypt: her story, part II – bird in a gilded cage\n\nQueen Nazli’s Story: part III – her final years – United States\n\nQueen Nazli’s great grandfather – Suleiman al Faransawi – Joseph Anthelme Seve\n\nAbdeen Palace, Cairo\n\nP.S. from Mara – I originally got interested in the Farouk and Muhammad Ali family trees about 5 years after starting work on my own – much to my astonishment I found myself connected by a few marriages to Queen Nazli’s tree. Then I started researching and gathering photos. Today at Mara House in Luxor every wall of the downstairs Guest bar is covered with photos of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and all are in geneological order – as best I could in the allotted space. The project is ongoing, as is the gathering and publishing of the stories.\n\nHi, I'm Mara, the founder of Mara House Hotel in Luxor.
