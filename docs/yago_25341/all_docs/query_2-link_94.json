        "text": "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (October 26, 1919 - July 27, 1980) was the last Shah of Iran, ruling from 1941 until 1979. He was born in Tehran, Iran.\n\nShah Mohammad Reza PahlaviAs a young man, he was educated at Institute Le Rosey, a Swiss finishing school and in Tehran at the Military College.\n\nHis father, Reza Pahlavi, (1877-1944), was minister of war and was elected by the Iranian Assembly as Shah in 1925. Concerned that Reza Pahlavi was about to align his petroleum-rich country with Germany during World War II, Britain and the USSR occupied Iran and forced him to resign in favor of his son. His mother was the shah's second wife, Tadj ol-Molouk (1896 - 1982).\n\nAt the end of the War, political unrest dogged Iran and in 1953 the nation's socialist Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh forced the Shah to flee the country. He was quickly escorted back to power by a joint military operation orchestrated by the American CIA and British MI5.\n\nWith Iran's great oil wealth, Pahlavi became the preeminent leader of the Middle East. He abolished the multiparty system of government so that elections for one party only allowed him to rule as an absolute dictator. During this time the Shah formalised his secret police force, SAVAK. Pahlavi made major changes to curb certain ancient elite factions by breaking up all large and middle-sized estates for the benefit of more than four million small farmers. In what was called 'the White Revolution', he took a number of populist measures, including extended suffrage to women, to favour the people.\n\nHis policies led to strong economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s but at the same time, opposition to his autocratic rule increased. On January 16, 1979 he and his family were forced to flee Iran a second time following a year of extreme turmoil and public protests. Following the Shah's departure, conservative Muslims led by the Ayatollah Khomeini staged a revolt, abolishing the monarchy and establishing an Islamic Republic.\n\nThe exiled monarch, now largely unpopular with much of the world traveled from country to country seeking what he believed would be a temporary residence. For a while he stayed in Paraguay, but his non-Hodgkins lymphoma began to grow worse, and demanded immediate and sophisticated treatment. Reluctantly, Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah to make a brief stopover in the United States, and undergo medical treatment. The compromise was extremely unpopular in Iran, where the new regime had now villified the Shah as a \"blood sucker\" and American stooge. Khomeini demanded the former monarch's return to Iran to face trial and execution for his alleged misdeeds. Once the Shah's treatment had finished, the American government, eager to avoid further controversy sent Pahlavi out of the country. He eventually settled in Egypt, where he remained until his death on July 27, 1980.\n\nThe last shah of Iran was married three times.\n\nHis first wife was Princess Fawzia of Egypt (born: November 5, 1921), the dazzlingly beautiful daughter of King Fuad I of Egypt and his wife, Nazli Sabri, and a sister of the notorious King Farouk I of Egypt; they married in 1939 and divorced in 1948, after her failure to produce an heir to the throne. They had one daughter, Shahnaz Pahlavi (born: October 27, 1940).\n\nHis second wife was Soraya Esfandiary Bakhtiari (June 22, 1932-October 26, 2001), daughter of Khalil Esfandiary Bakhtiari, Ambassador of Iran to the Federal Republic of Germany, and his German wife, Eva Karl; they were married in 1951 and divorced in 1958 when it became apparent that she could not bear children. (Given the title Princess Soraya of Iran after the divorce, she later became a film actress, appearing the 1965 movie \"Three Faces of a Woman,\" and mistress of its Italian director Franco Indovina, 1932-1972.) The shah's third wife was Farah Diba (born: October 14, 1938), daughter of Sohrab Diba, Capt., Imperial Iranian Army, and his wife, Faredeh Gothbi. They were married in 1959, and Farah was created Shahbanu, or empress, a title created especially for her (previous royal wives had been known as Malika, or queen); she bore him four children:\n\nCyrus Reza (born: October 31, 1960)\n\nYasmina Farahnaz (born: March 12, 1963)\n\nAli-Reza Pahlavi (born: April 28, 1966)\n\nLeila Pahlavi (March 27, 1970 - June 10, 2001)\n\nWhen the Reza and Fawzia divorced, Shahnaz had to stay in Iran and rarely saw her mother from then on out(once or twice in Switzerland in later years). Shahnaz was deemed virtually invisible by her father after Fawzia's departure.\n\nAs you might expect, she had an extremely dysfunctional and emotionally neglected childhood, and it carried into her adulthood. She developed heavy drug problems and went through a series of lovers and stormy relationships and a suicide attempt or two. The Shah threatened to disown her many times, only to be talked out of it by officials(most notably C.M. Alan) and Reza married her off for a political alliance. They divorced a few years later.\n\nEventually Reza got really tired of her and said demanded that she either immediately leave the country, change her lifestyle, get disowned or marry quietly in Switzerland coming back to Iran only when given permission. She picked the third option.\n\nApparently, she's still in Switzerland with her second husband and children, and now devoutly religious.\n\nAlicky said:\n\nShe developed heavy drug problems and went through a series of lovers and stormy relationships and a suicide attempt or two.

She picked the third option.\n\nApparently, she's still in Switzerland with her second husband and children, and now devoutly religious.\n\nwhat's the source of this?this is the first time I'm reading such things about her.\n\nfor always I've read that from the very begining she was quite religious,and those who were against Shah always appreciated her and wrote to her to complain.she's always described as the only one with clean hands and past in shah's family.\n\nactually she got married too young to be invovled in stormy relationships.she was only 16.\n\nwell from various sources...specificaly from book written by General Hussein Fardoost.in his book he talks of a letter mullahs wrote to Shahnaz to complain about shah and his desicions against Islam addressing shahnaz as the only religious royalty who has always paid attention to islamic values and their only hope to make shah attention too and... if there was any rumor about her they wouldnt write such a letter to her.\n\nGeneral Fardoost was shah's most trusted friend.they became friends at the age of six,and were always together through school and all their lives.\n\nthe reason why she was pushed behind was the fear Farah had about her past being told,though shahnaz was hurt very much she kept silent about it and when the secret was revealed she only didnt deny it and got divorced.\n\nps.if shah had any concern about relationships of people in his circle he'd have to sent his sister away who was a famous sex nuts.it's told that every night she slept with a diffrent male star or a sportman."
