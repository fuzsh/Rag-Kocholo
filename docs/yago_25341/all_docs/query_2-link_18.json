        "text": "Egyptian royal (1923–1994)\n\nPrincess Faiza (Arabic: الأميرة فايزة; 8 November 1923 – 6 June 1994) was an Egyptian princess and a member of the Muhammad Ali dynasty.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincess Faiza was born in the Abdeen Palace, Cairo, on 8 November 1923.[1][2] She was the third child of King Fuad I and Nazli Sabri.[3] Princess Faiza was the sister of King Farouk, Princess Fawzia, Princess Faika and Princess Fathia.[2][4] Her maternal great-grandfather was Major-General Muhammad Sharif Pasha, prime minister and minister for foreign affairs, who was of Turkish origin.[5]\n\nMarriage and activities\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincess Faiza did not want to marry a member of the Middle East royal family.[6] Instead, she married her Turkish cousin Bulent Rauf, who was thirty-four years old, in Cairo on 17 May 1945.[7][8] Their marriage was arranged through familial relations.[7] He was a Western educated man and the grandson of Ismail Pasha.[6] King Farouk did not support their marriage, but reluctantly endorsed it.[6] Princess Faiza and her husband lived in the Zohria Palace on Gezira Island on the Nile after their marriage.[1][9]\n\nPrincess Faiza was instrumental in Princess Fawzia's long period of convalescence in Egypt after divorcing from the Shah of Iran in 1948.[10] Faiza was one of the leading figures of the Red Crescent Society in Egypt during the reign of King Farouk.[11] King Farouk put her and her husband under house arrest due to his suspicion.[1] She and her husband launched a homemade film about a military coup six weeks before the events of 1952.[12] They had no issue, and divorced in 1962.[7]\n\nLater life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the abdication of King Farouk following the 1952 Revolution in Egypt, Princess Faiza moved to Istanbul in 1954.[1] Then, she and her husband went to Spain and France.[7] Next, she went to the US and settled in Beverly Hills, leaving her husband in Paris.[6][7]\n\nPrincess Faiza died on 9 June 1994 at the age of 70 in Westwood, Los Angeles.[4][11]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
