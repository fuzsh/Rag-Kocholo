        "text": "In many ways, the early life of Princess Fawzia of Egypt sounds like that of a fairytale. A beautiful princess with movie star good looks that saw her compared to iconic beauties of the time Hedy Lamarr and Vivien Leigh, she grew up in the bucolic surroundings of the Ras el-Tin Palace in Alexandria, much adored and mollycoddled. Cecil Beaton, who took her portrait for TIME magazine in 1942, described her as ‘An Asian Venus’, with ‘a perfect heart-shaped face and strangely pale but piercing blue eyes’. Yet her life was not an easy one, commenting in later years that she had ‘not lost one crown, but two’, as her own family’s fortunes fell shortly after her marriage to the Shah of Iran also ended.\n\nShe was born 99 years ago today on 5 November 1921, the eldest daughter of Sultan Fuad I of Egypt and Sudan (later King Fuad I), and his second wife, Nazli Sabri. With dark hair and blue eyes, she was of mixed Egyptian and Albanian descent, and was educated in Switzerland, making her fluent in three languages, Arabic, English and French.\n\nHer marriage to Crown Prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran was a political one, orchestrated by the groom’s father. It was notable at the time for uniting an historic royal family (the House of Ali had ruled Egypt since 1805) with a relatively new one (the Prince’s father had seized power in Iran in a military coup in only 1921), and for being a marriage between a Sunni (the Princess) and Shia Muslim (the Prince). In many ways, it was doomed from the start.\n\nAt first, Fawzia’s brother, King Farouk, was resistant to the Shah’s attempts to win his approval for a union. In fact, he only agreed to the match after pressure from his advisors, who saw in it an attempt to secure Egypt’s position in the region. The couple met just once before their wedding day, which was at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo on 15 March 1939. It was a lavish ceremony - something of a signature from Farouk, who was known for his love of grand displays of wealth - with a 20-course meal. Not to be outdone, the follow-up celebrations in Tehran included a stadium visit with an acrobatic display.\n\nIn 1941, Fawzia became the Empress of Iran, after her husband ascended to the throne following the exile of his father, following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran.\n\nYet with so much working against them culturally and religiously, it is unsurprising that the union did not work. Fawzia found life very different in Iran, having become used to the splendour of her brother’s court in Egypt. She complained that the French food at their Tehran wedding was ‘sub-par’ and that the palaces were not as grand. She was also on bad terms with her in-laws (one of her sister-in-laws even broke a vase over her head), while her husband was openly conducting extra-marital affairs.\n\nAfter the birth of her daughter, Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi, she retreated from royal life, refusing to speak in any language but French, and becoming increasingly hostile to Iran and the Iranian way of life. She started seeing an American psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with depression.\n\nWhen news of the Princess’s unhappiness reached Egypt, courtiers were dispatched to check on her. After reporting that she was so thin that her shoulder blades were ‘jutted out like the fins of some undernourished fish.’ The reaction of her brother was swift - he urged her to come home, and a divorce was granted three years after she returned to Cairo, in 1948. Announcing her return to Egypt, the court put out the following statement: ‘The Persian climate had endangered the health of Empress Fawzia, and that thus it was agreed that the Egyptian King’s sister be divorced.’ Her daughter remained in Iran.\n\nJust a year later, in 1949, she married again, this time to Egyptian aristocrat Colonel Ismail Chirine. This time, it was a love match, and the two went on to have a son and a daughter. The House of Ali was deposed in 1952 after a revolution, but the Princess went on living in Egypt. It was then she uttered her famous remarks that she had lost not one crown, but two. She died on 2 July 2013 at the age of 91."
