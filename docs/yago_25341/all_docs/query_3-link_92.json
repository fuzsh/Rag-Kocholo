        "text": "Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt\n\nHer Royal Highness Princess Fawzia Fuad of Egypt was born in 1921 in Alexandria’s Ras El-Tin Palace, by the Mediterranean Sea. Princess Fawzia was the sister of King Farouk I. of Egypt. Aged only 18, she was married off into the Pahlavi Imperial Family of Persia, marrying Crown Prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1939. In order to marry the Crown Prince, the Sunni Princess was obliged to convert to Shia Islam, which was and still is the type of Islam practiced in Persia (today called Iran).\n\nThe first wedding ceremony was held in Cairo, Egypt, followed by a second, Shia-tradition one, in Teheran soon after. The Princess moved form Alexandria to Teheran, to live in a palace together with her husband. Within a year of marriage, the Princess bore the Crown Prince a child, a daughter, which they named “Shahnaz” (b. 1940), which in Persian and Arabic means “Pride of the King”.\n\nFawzia was not happy with the marriage, as it was rather a political move on behalf of the parents of the Crown Prince and Fawzia’s father. The Pahlavis have only recently come to power in Persia, after toppling another Imperial Dynasty. Due to the dynasty being a very young one, Shah Reza, the father of Crown Prince Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, decided it would be good for his son to marry a Princess of a traditional Middle-Eastern dynasty, in order to increase the popularity of the Pahlavi dynasty and to ensure their rule.\n\nThe Shah came across the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt, which was founded by Mehmet Pasha, an Albanian officer in the Ottoman army. Mehmet Pasha established himself as the Khedive of the Ottoman province of Egypt, seizing power in 1805. Soon enough, the Muhammad Alis established themselves as the Sultans of Egypt. Therefore, Fawzia was born with the title „Her Sultanic Highness“\n\nAs the United Kingdom recognised Egyptian independence in 1922, Fuad I. made Egypt a Kingdom and started to use the title of King and Queen for him and his wife, with the styles of “His/Her Majesty” and “His/Her Royal Highness” for Princes and Princesses.\n\nIn the eyes of the Shah, the Muhammad Alis were perfectly fitted for his plans. Therefore he soon suggested a marriage between the Crown Prince and the eldest daughter of the Egyptian King Fuad I. by his second wife, Queen Nazli Sabri.\n\nFawzia was a beautiful young woman, known worldwide for her amazing beauty. She rose to international fame after being photographed by British photographer Cecil Beaton for the cover of „Life“ magazine on 21 September 1942. Beaton himself described the Princess as an “Asian Venus” with „a perfect heart-shaped face and strangely pale but piercing blue eyes.“. She was often compared to Hollywood stars Hedy Lamarr and Vivien Leigh due to her beauty. Another nickname attributed to her was the “Rose of the Nile”.\n\nHer marriage with the Crown Prince who would eventually become the Shah of Persia, making Fawzia Queen (the title of Empress as such did not exist in Persia, until the Shah married his third wife, after previously having divorced Fawzia and his second wife), led to her becoming depressed, as she showed no interest in learning the Persian language, the climate was unbearable for the Princess and the Court Life in Persia was different to the lavish, luxurious one she led back home in Egypt. Fawzia, who was a very Western woman disliked the “isolated” and “restricted” Persian culture and life. Furthermore, the Queen often fell sick due to the climatic conditions in Teheran.\n\nReportedly, the Queen would throughout the day exclaim “Je m’ennuie” (“I am bored“) in French. French was the language the Queen used to communicate with the staff at the Palace, as she never learned Persian. Fawzia eventually started sleeping in a separate bedroom to that of her husband as well.\n\nWhen her father visited her in Persia, he was shocked to find his daughter with dark eye bags and a sickly appearance. He immediately decided to take his daughter back to Egypt, where Fawzia filed for a divorce from the Shah, which was completed in May 1945. However, Persia did not recognise the divorce until 1948. The official reason stated in the divorce was that the Princess could no longer bear the climate of Teheran and for the sake of her health, both families have decided for a divorce to be the best solution to the matter. Princess Fawzia was obliged to leave her daughter Shahnaz behind in Teheran and was forbidden from seeing her.\n\nFawzia eventually married Colonel Ismail Chirine, a distant relative of the Muhammad Ali dynasty and an Egyptian aristocrat. Together with him, she had two more children, Nadia Chirine and Hussein Chirine. Princess Fawzia, after the Egyptian revolution of 1952, remained in Alexandria, where she lived until her peaceful death in July 2014, in her house in Alexandria, aged 91.\n\nPrincess Fawzia was mainly of Turkish, French, Albanian and Circassian descend. The Princess spoke fluent Arabic, French and English. She was educated in Switzerland.\n\nHer daughter Shahnaz, whom she had with the Shah, grew to become a woman with the beauty of her mother, Princess Fawzia.\n\nHer Imperial Highness Princess Shahnaz of Iran."
