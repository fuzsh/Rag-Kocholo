        "text": "Fuad I (born March 26 1868) is the King of Egypt since the creation of the Kingdom of Egypt as a Puppet State of the Italian Empire after the Empire liberated Egypt from British domination and oppression by the British who dominated the Sultanate of Egypt as a Protectorate since 1882.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nFuad was born in Giza Palace in Cairo, the seventh son of Isma'il Pasha.[citation needed] He spent his childhood with his exiled father in Naples. He got his education from the military academy in Turin, Italy. His mother was Ferial Qadin.\n\nPrior to becoming sultan, Fuad had played a major role in the establishment of Cairo University. He became the university's first rector in 1908, and remained in the post until his resignation in 1913. He was succeeded as rector by then-minister of Justice Hussein Rushdi Pasha. In 1913, Fuad made unsuccessful attempts to secure the throne of Albania for himself, which had obtained its independence from the Ottoman Empire a year earlier. At the time, Egypt and Sudan was ruled by his nephew, Abbas II, and the likelihood of Fuad becoming the monarch in his own country seemed remote. This, and the fact that the Muhammad Ali dynasty was of Albanian descent, encouraged Fuad to seek the Albanian throne. Fuad also served as President of the Egyptian Geographic Society from 1915 until 1918.\n\nReign[]\n\nFuad was unable to take the Albanian throne as the Italians conquered it during World War I and placed Zog I (who was Christian) on the throne of Albania. The Italians instead conqured Egypt and decided to colonize it, but instead the regional Praetor as a way to appease Arab Rebels made Egypt a Puppet State ruled by Fuad himself as King and proclaimed the Kingdom of Egypt. Fuad's brother the Sultan of Egypt was then overthrown as the British Protectorate ended.\n\nCreation of Royal Archives[]\n\nFuad was an instrumental force in modern Egyptian historiography. He employed numerous archivists to copy, translate, and arrange eighty-seven volumes of correspondence related to his paternal ancestors from European archives, and later to collect old documents from Egyptian archives into what became the Royal Archives in the 1930s. Fuad's efforts to portray his ancestors — especially his great-grandfather Muhammad Ali, his grandfather Ibrahim, and his father — as nationalists and benevolent monarchs would prove to be an enduring influence on Egyptian history.\n\nMarriages[]\n\nFuad married his first wife in Cairo, on 30 May 1895 (nikah), and at the Abbasiya Palace in Cairo, on 14 February 1896 (zifaf), Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi (b. 1876). She was his first cousin once removed and the only daughter of Field Marshal Prince Ibrahim Fahmi Ahmad Pasha (his first cousin) by his first wife, Vijdan Navjuvan Khanum. They had two children, a son, Ismail Fuad, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Fawkia. Unhappily married, the couple divorced in 1898. During a dispute with the brother of his first wife, Prince Ahmad Saif-uddin Ibrahim Bey, Fuad was shot in the throat. He survived, but carried that scar the rest of his life.\n\nthey have two children\n\nIsmail Fuad (1896–1896)\n\nFawkia (b. 1897)\n\nFuad married his second wife at the Bustan Palace in Cairo on 24 May 1919. She was Nazli Sabri (1894–1978), daughter of Abdu'r-Rahim Pasha Sabri, sometime Minister of Agriculture and Governor of Cairo, by his wife, Tawfika Khanum Sharif. Queen Nazli also was a maternal granddaughter of Major-General Muhammad Sharif Pasha, sometime Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a great-granddaughter of Suleiman Pasha, a French officer in Napoleon's army who converted to Islam and reorganized the Egyptian army. The couple had five children, Farouk the Crown Prince, and four daughters, the Princesses Fawzia (The Crown Princess of Libya), Faiza, Faika, and Fathiya.\n\nAs with his first wife, Fuad's relation with his second wife was also stormy. The couple continually fought, Fuad even forbidding Nazli from leaving the palace. When Fuad died, it was said that the triumphant Nazli sold all of his clothes to a local used-clothes market in revenge. Fuad died at the Koubbeh Palace in Cairo and was buried at the Khedival Mausoleum in the ar-Rifai Mosque in Cairo.\n\nHe had five Children from his second wife"
