        "text": "Pelicans sign Antonio Reeves to a three-year contract\n\nMichael Scotto: The New Orleans Pelicans and Antonio Reeves have agreed to a three-year, $5.41 million deal, league sources told @hoopshype. Reeves was the No. 47 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic and was acquired by the Pelicans in a trade during the draft.\n\nJalen Wilson named MVP of the Summer League\n\nNBA Communications: Brooklyn Nets forward Jalen Wilson has been named the Most Valuable Player of NBA 2K25 Summer League 2024. Wilson averaged 21.8 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 0.6 steals while shooting 47.3% from the field and 55.0% from three-point range in five games in Las Vegas.\n\nBasketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal wants to sell one of his two homes in Dallas-Fort Worth. Months after closing on a home in Rockwall County, O’Neal now seeks to sell the Carrollton estate he purchased in 2022. The asking price for the 5,269-square-foot home is just shy of $1.7 million. Built in 2005, the house has five bedrooms, five full bathrooms, and two half baths.\n\nA Sept. 3 “change of plea hearing” was scheduled which, if finalized as it is proposed, would call for Rondo to plead guilty to the gun charge and have drug paraphernalia and marijuana charges dismissed. All of the charges are misdemeanors. The potential sentence, according to the proposed plea, would be a suspended jail sentence and probation. The proposed agreement is not official until both sides agree to it in court."
