In amazing shape today Dexter, Michael C Hall Is a Rock Star : All About His Band Princess Goes to the Butterfly Museum dropped their self-titled debut EP on Thursday.\n\nHere is how he got in shape. For his role as Dexter, Michael C Hall tapped celebrity trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche. Gregory Joujon-Roche, who charged $5,000 per week, came with a support team -- One Body One Life aka Holistic Fitness who made sure their clients had access to a masseuse, nutritionist, martial arts instructor, yoga instructor, and core trainer. Much like Dexter's full team working with him, the Michael C Hall Workout utilized a full team.\n\nMichael C Hall Workout Monday Routine = Chest & Shoulders\n\nThe Monday routine starts with cardio. Michael C Hall, who plays Dexter Morgan, trains with Gregory Joujon-Roche. Greg suggests using a heart monitor to make sure you’re at the correct heart rate levels. Here’s the Michael C Hall treadmill/abs routine:\n\nDo 20 minutes on Treadmill (@2% Incline)\n\nAfter 10 minutes, make sure you’re heart rate is @75%\n\nAfter 20 minutes, stop and do these three core abs exercises: (Ab Circuit)\n\nGregory shows you the Accordian Crunches here\n\nSide Bridges\n\nSupermans\n\n2 minutes treadmill @ 85% heart rate (160 BPM)\n\nRepeat Ab Circuit (x4 times total sets)\n\nDo 2 minute sprint between each ab circuit\n\nAfter 4th set of abs, end with run on treadmill for 5 minutes @87%\n\nAfter doing cardio/abs, they would have specific body parts they would work on. They would start each weak with chest / shoulder muscles. Here’s the Monday weightlifting routine:\n\nDive Bombers\n\nDumbbell Bench Press\n\nAdvanced Chest Flys\n\nCable Flys\n\nMilitary Press\n\nShoulder Workout Plan : Lateral Flys\n\nFront Raises\n\nBarrwl Flys\n\nRep-Out Push Ups (as many as you can)\n\nWhen doing Dive Bombers, trainer Gregory Joujon-Roche says:\n\nSTRETCH YOUR ABS AND LOWER BACK, REALLY OPEN THEM UP. POINT YOUR PINKIE OUTWARD, AND SPREAD YOUR FINGERS. THIS TAKES THE TENSION OFF YOUR NECK, AND PUTS IT INTO YOUR TRICEPS AND REAR DELTOIDS.\n\nMichael C Hall Workout Tuesday Routine = Legs\n\nHere’s the Tuesday Legs Focus Weightlifting Routine:\n\nDumbell Step Ups\n\nLunges with a kick\n\nLateral Shuffle Cardio Intervall(3, 1-minute bursts)\n\nRocket Jump Squat\n\nLeg Extensions\n\nMountain Climbers Cardio Interval (2 sets of 15 each leg)\n\nV-Lift\n\nHanging Leg Raises\n\nSkater Lunges Cardio Intervals (20-30 jumps each side)\n\nMartial Arts: Hold a 10 lb. dumbbell for all these moves:\n\nJab-Cross Combinations (25 reps)\n\nJab-Cross-Roundhouse Kick (25 reps)\n\nJab-Cross-Roundhouse Kick-Jab-Cross-Hook (20 reps)\n\nSnap-and-Roundhouse Combo (50 kick)\n\nRoundhouse Kicks (Rapid Fire 50 kicks)\n\nThai Knee-Abs\n\nMichael C Hall Workout Wednesday Routine = Abs\n\nHere’s the Wednesday Abs Focus weightlifting routine. It starts with the Treadmill Cardio/Abs Routine.\n\nDo 20 minutes on Treadmill (@2% Incline)\n\nAfter 10 minutes, make sure you’re heart rate is @75%\n\nAfter 20 minutes, stop and do these three core abs exercises: (Ab Circuit)\n\nAccordion Crunches\n\nSide Bridges Gregory shows you Side Bridges\n\nSupermans\n\n2 minutes treadmill @ 85% heart rate (160 BPM)\n\nRepeat Ab Circuit (x3 more times)\n\nDo 2 minute sprint between each ab circuit\n\nAfter 4th set of abs, end with run on treadmill for 5 minutes @87%\n\nFor the abs, Gregory Joujon-Roche wants you to go to failure. But, if you’re numbers-focused then aim for 5 sets: 10-15 reps per set, 60 secs rest between sets.\n\nReverse Crunches\n\nJackknifes\n\nPlank Extensions\n\nElbow Side Planks\n\nV-Ups\n\nBicycle Crunches\n\nLower Leg Curls\n\nWeighted Decline Sit-ups\n\nHip Flexicons with a Punch\n\nCounting reps isn’t what’s important. Instead, Michael C Hall’s trainer, Gregory Joujon-Roche, wants you to reach a breakthrough moment:\n\nIN THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT, YOU TEETER ON THE EDGE OF FAILURE, BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN PERFORM EVEN ONE MORE REP. YOUR MUSCLES SAY YOU CAN’T. YOUR MIND SAYS YOU CAN.
