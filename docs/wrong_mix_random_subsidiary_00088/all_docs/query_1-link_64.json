        "text": "Biography:\n\nDr. Helgoe is a clinical psychologist with a broad background in clinical practice, education, and scholarship. She has served in a variety of settings including rural human services, urban private practice, and teaching institutions such as Hamm Clinic. Her teaching background spans undergraduate and graduate faculty positions. She most recently served as a Behavioral Sciences faculty at Ross University School of Medicine where she founded and built a schoolwide mind-body medicine program for students and engaged both faculty and students in changing the culture of burnout in medical education. Dr. Helgoe’s scholarly interests have focused on the relationship between personality and culture. She is author of Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life Is Your Hidden Strength (Sourcebooks, 2013, 2008), which is published in seven languages, and was part of the effort that kept introversion out of the diagnostic manuals. Her newest book, Fragile Bully: Understanding Our Destructive Affair with Narcissism in the Age of Trump (Diversion Books, March 12, 2019), explores the relationship between narcissism and American political and interpersonal discourse. Dr. Helgoe also authored the Psychology Today cover story, “Revenge of the Introvert,” wrote an expert contribution for the textbook, Contemporary Organizational Behavior in Action (Pearson-Prentice Hall, 2016), and has been quoted in several national and international publications including the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Dr. Helgoe has a strong interest and background in theories of psychotherapy, particularly psychodynamic, humanistic/experiential, postmodern and integrative approaches. As a professional oil painter and avid moviegoer, she is interested in exploring the relationship between artistic engagement and mindfulness.\n\nEducation:\n\nPhD in Clinical Psychology from University of Nevada-Reno in 1989\n\nMA in Clinical Psychology from University of Nevada-Reno in 1987\n\nBA from Gustavus Adolphus College in 1983\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nContent areas: Language, culture, and the construction of psychopathology; introversion; postmodern and narrative therapies; cinematic immersion as mindfulness practice; artistic engagement and mindful attention; therapeutic writing and third-person narrative; mind-body\n\nmedicine; personality and culture; narcissism; personality development, defenses, and disorders.\n\nResearch methodology: Varied\n\nPopulations: Adult\n\nProfessional Contributions:\n\nRecipient of the Ron Taylor Award for excellence in teaching.
