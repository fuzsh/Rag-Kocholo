Off-Broadway, he appeared in Macbeth and Cymbeline at the New York Shakespeare Festival, and in Timon of Athens and Henry V at the Public Theater, The English Teachers at the Manhattan Class Company, and the controversial play Corpus Christi at the Manhattan Theatre Club. He also performed in the workshop production of what was then known as Sondheim's Wise Guys, later versions of which were titled Bounce and, finally, Road Show. He sang the role of Paris Singer; this character's songs and function in the play were transferred to the character Hollis Bessamer in the final version of the play. In Los Angeles, he appeared in Skylight at the Mark Taper Forum. He also was part of the Texas Shakespeare Festival the summer of 1995. He played Lancelot in Camelot, Lysander in A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing.\n\nHall starred in and co-produced the Showtime television series Dexter, in which he played the eponymous character, a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department who moonlights as a serial killer/vigilante. The series premiered on October 1, 2006, and ended its run in 2013. For his work on Dexter, Hall was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. He won the 2007 Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. Hall was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Drama in 2007 and again in 2008, winning the award at the 67th Golden Globe Awards in 2010. Also in 2010, he won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nHall's film credits include the 2003 thriller Paycheck, the 2009 science fiction thriller Gamer, the 2011 comedy Peep World, and the 2011 drama The Trouble with Bliss.
