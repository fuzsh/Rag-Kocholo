        "text": "Born in 1971 in North Carolina, Michael C Hall attended Tisch School of Arts where he studied the New York University’s Graduate Acting Program in 1996. Hall’s early theatre career started in off-Broadway productions of Cymbeline, Macbeth, Henry V and Timon of Athens at the Public Theater, as well as risqué play Corpus Christi at the Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\nHe is perhaps most famously known as the title character in Dexter, which he starred and co-produced. The show ran for seven years, ending in 2013 and was nominated for five Emmy Awards. Hall himself won the Individual achievement award in Drama in the 2007 Television Critics Association Award, and in the same year won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Drama. Hall has also starred in Six Feet Under and Gamer with Gerard Butler."
