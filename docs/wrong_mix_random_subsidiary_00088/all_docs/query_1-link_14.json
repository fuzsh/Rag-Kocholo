        "text": "Mack Brown, whose charismatic style and disciplined approach propelled the University of North Carolina to the Top Five and the University of Texas to the 2005 BCS National Championship, began his second stint as head coach in Chapel Hill on Nov. 27, 2018.\n\nA 46-year veteran of collegiate coaching, Brown has served as a head coach for 35 seasons with stops at Texas (1998-2013), North Carolina (1988-97, 2019-23), Tulane (1985-87), and Appalachian State (1983). Over his 35 seasons, Brown has posted a record of 282-149-1 (.654). Those 282 career victories rank seventh on the FBS all-time list and are the most among active coaches. The 2005 Paul W. “Bear” Bryant National Coach of the Year and the 2008 Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year, Brown is one of a handful of coaches in college football history to lead two separate programs to Top-Five national finishes and is one of three active coaches to win a National Championship.\n\nIn year five under Coach Brown, the Tar Heels won eight games and played in the Duke’s Mayo Bowl. Combined with the nine wins in 2022, the Heels won 17 games over two seasons for just the third time since Brown’s first stint in Chapel Hill. UNC also played in a bowl game for the fifth consecutive season for the first time since Brown led the Tar Heels in the ‘90s. In addition, Carolina won its fifth-straight games over Duke and Miami, and with the season-opening win over South Carolina, Brown became the first coach to win 100 games at two FBS schools. RB Omarion Hampton produced a standout season, earning first-team All-America and All-ACC honors, while being named a finalist for the Doak Walker Award. UNC had 13 players earn 14 All-ACC honors with Hampton, LB Cedric Gray and TE Bryson Nesbit claiming first-team recognition. Brown continued his success in preparing players for the NFL with four players being selected in the 2023 NFL Draft. The 15 drafted players over the previous four drafts were tied for the second-most in the ACC. The Heels continued to recruit well, securing another Top 25 class to go along with a strong group of transfers. Off the field, UNC’s student-athletes showcased their academic prowess by being recognized by the AFCA with the 2023 Academic Achievement Award. Carolina earned the award for recording the highest graduation rate for members of the 2016-22 cohort. This marked the first time Carolina was recognized with the award.\n\nDuring Brown’s fourth season in his return to Chapel Hill, UNC won nine games, was the ACC Coastal Division Champions, and qualified for the Holiday Bowl, the Tar Heels fourth consecutive bowl trip. Carolina won nine games for just the second time since Brown’s first stint in Chapel Hill with 2015 being the other occurrence. It was UNC’s sixth nine-win season since 1982 with Brown-led teams accounting for five of them. Carolina also produced a major turnaround on the road. The Heels went 6-0 in true road games for the first time in school history. UNC and TCU were the only schools across the country with six road wins. The Heels produced two All-Americans in WR Josh Downs and LB Cedric Gray to go along with 11 All-ACC honors. QB Drake Maye claimed numerous conference honors including ACC Player of the Year and went on to be named National Freshman of the Year by both the Maxwell Award and the FWAA. Brown mentored four NFL Draft Picks in the 2022 NFL Draft, which brought UNC’s total to 11 during his second stint. UNC continued to recruit at a high level, producing another Top-25 signing class, while supplementing that with a strong group of nine transfers.\n\nIn year three of his return, Brown led the Tar Heels to their third consecutive bowl game, which hadn’t happened since 2016 and occurred only one other time since his departure in 1997. Carolina snapped a four-game losing streak to Virginia, defeated Miami for the third consecutive season, and defeated a Top-10 opponent at home for the first time since 2004. UNC saw five of its Tar Heels selected in the 2021 NFL Draft with three of players going in the first three rounds. Carolina signed the No. 8 recruiting class in the country, the school’s highest-ranked recruiting class in the internet era. Academically, Carolina produced the program’s highest single-year APR score, a 997, which was 23 points higher than the previous best. The team also earned the program’s two highest GPAs over the previous three semesters.\n\nBrown completed a remarkable turnaround in year two of his return to Carolina, leading the Tar Heels from two wins in 2018 to the Orange Bowl in 2020. Carolina, which went 8-4, spent much of the season ranked in the Top 25, finishing the regular season at No. 13 in the College Football Playoff rankings and ending the year ranked 18th in the AP Poll and 17th in the Coaches Poll. This marked just the second time since Brown’s departure in 1997 that Carolina finished a season in the Top 25. Under his guidance, Carolina produced four All-Americans, 13 All-ACC selections, a Top-15 recruiting class and averaged a 3.0 GPA over the spring and fall semesters.\n\nIn his first season back at the helm at North Carolina in 2019, Brown led the Tar Heels to a winning season and a resounding victory in the Military Bowl. The seven wins were two more than UNC had won in its previous two seasons combined (5) and the Heels won a bowl game for the first time since 2013. Carolina played close games seemingly all season. Its nine games decided by seven points or less were the most since 1936 and the Tar Heels’ six losses came by a total of just 26 points. Brown’s ‘19 UNC squad produced two NFL Draft picks, five NFL free-agent signees, 11 All-ACC honors and freshman QB Sam Howell was named ACC Offensive Rookie and Rookie of the Year before earning Freshman All-America honors.\n\nPrior to returning to Carolina, Brown served as both a college football studio analyst and color analyst for ESPN.\n\nAt the completion of his Texas tenure in 2013, Brown was one of just four active coaches to reach the 200-victory plateau. He was also one of only two coaches nationally to lead his teams to 21 bowls in 22 seasons, and the only one to have 23 winning seasons in the previous 24 years. His 225 wins from 1990 to 2013, which combined the last eight years of his first stint at UNC and his entire Texas tenure, were the most of any coach in the country.\n\nAs a result, Brown was inducted into the National Football Foundation College Football Hall of Fame in December of 2018. He was the eighth Tar Heel to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the third coach. In addition to the College Football Hall of Fame, Brown is also a member of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, the Longhorn Hall of Honor, the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame and the Holiday Bowl Hall of Fame.\n\nBrown has also succeeded in preparing his student-athletes for the next level. In the 35 NFL Drafts during Brown's time as a head coach, the NFL has picked 144 of his student-athletes, and at least one was selected in 30 straight drafts. In fact, Brown has had a player selected in the NFL Draft in 33 of his 35 drafts as a head coach. He had 20 players selected in the first round of the draft from 1998 to 2013. At Carolina, Brown has mentored 70 Tar Heels who have heard their names called in the NFL Draft, including 29 in the first three rounds.\n\nWith all of the success on the field, the primary emphasis has remained the same with Brown's squads -- maintaining a high level of achievement in the classroom and in the community. Eighty percent of his players at North Carolina received their degrees and he increased the pace at Texas, while more than a third of his players at UT regularly earned 3.0 grade point averages and achieved spots on the Big 12 Commissioner's and Athletics Director's Honor Rolls. During his second stint at Carolina, the program has produced the four highest single-year APR rates over the last four seasons (993 in 2022-23, 984 in 2021-22, 1,000 in 2020-21 and 997 in 2019-20). The program also set highest-ever multi-year APR rate at 996, which is 14 points higher than the previous best se the year before. The 996 APR rate ranked first in the ACC and was tied for third among Power 4 programs. In addition, Brown’s players have earned the highest annual GPAs in over a decade and the program has seen 163 Tar Heels earn their degrees over the last five years.\n\nBrown’s first stint as head coach of the Tar Heels came from 1988-97. He led Carolina to a record of 69-46-1 (.599), which included three 10-win seasons, six consecutive bowl games, a Top-Five finish, a Top-10 finish and two Top-20 finishes.\n\nAt UNC, Brown recruited and coached several of the finest players in school history. From his 1997 squad alone, DE Greg Ellis (No. 8, Dallas Cowboys), LB Brian Simmons (No. 17, Cincinnati Bengals) and DT Vonnie Holliday (No. 19, Green Bay Packers) were selected among the first 19 picks in the 1998 NFL Draft.\n\nAlong with that trio of first-rounders, Brown also helped develop several other Tar Heel standouts. CB Dré Bly, was a three-time All-American who recorded an ACC-record 20 interceptions during his career and played 11 seasons in the NFL. Corey Holliday, who currently serves as UNC’s Associate A.D. for Football Administration, finished his career as the leading receiver in Carolina history, was a CFA/Hitachi Scholar-Athlete, and is a former member of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Dwight Hollier, who currently serves as UNC’s Senior Associate A.D. for Student-Athlete Health, Well-Being & Program Outreach, made more than 500 tackles during his Carolina career and also played in the NFL. RB Natrone Means, who is currently an offensive analyst on staff, rushed for more than 1,000 yards in his final two seasons at UNC and went on to lead the San Diego Chargers to Super Bowl XXIX and the Jacksonville Jaguars to the 1996 AFC title game.\n\nQBs Jason Stanicek and Mike Thomas combined to rewrite Carolina's passing and total offense records. DT Marcus Jones, a consensus first-team All-American, earned ACC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 1995. CB Thomas Smith came to UNC in 1989 as a walk-on from a small high school in North Carolina and departed as a first-round pick of the AFC Champion Buffalo Bills. RB Leon Johnson, one of the premier all-purpose offensive threats in ACC history, played eight seasons in the NFL. TE Freddie Jones, a second-round draft choice of the San Diego Chargers in 1997, was one of the NFL's top pass-catching tight ends and played eight seasons in the NFL.\n\nDuring his 10 seasons at Carolina, the Tar Heels featured a Lombardi Award finalist, a two-time Thorpe Award finalist, a Butkus Award finalist and semifinalist, 16 All-Americans, 34 first-team All-ACC selections, an ACC Defensive Player of the Year and an ACC Rookie of the Year. Brown also helped his players with professional aspirations as 38 of his Tar Heels heard their names called in the NFL Draft, including 16 in the first three rounds. In addition to the three first-rounders in 1998, Marcus Jones (Tampa Bay Buccaneers ‘96) and Thomas Smith (Buffalo Bills ’93) were first-round selections; Freddie Jones (San Diego Chargers ’97), Rick Terry (New York Jets ’97), Bucky Brooks (Buffalo Bills ’94) and Natrone Means (San Diego Chargers ’93) were second-round picks; and James Hamilton (Jacksonville Jaguars ’97), William Henderson (Green Bay Packers ’95), Jimmy Hitchcock (New England Patriots ’95), Rondell Jones (Denver Broncos ’93), Brian Bollinger (San Francisco 49ers ’92), Kevin Donnalley (Houston Texans ’91) and Darrell Hamilton (Denver Broncos ’89) were chosen in the third round.\n\nIn 1988, Brown took over a North Carolina program that had suffered two losing seasons in its previous three years and three non-winning seasons in its previous four years. While rebuilding the foundation, Brown's Carolina squads posted back-to-back 1-10 seasons in 1988 and '89. In 1990, Carolina was 6-4-1 and UNC began a run of eight consecutive winning seasons and six straight bowl game appearances. Carolina's 54-18 (.750) record during his last six years ranked as the ninth-best nationally during that period.\n\nThe first campaign in that six-year run was the 1992 season that saw Carolina go 9-3, finish No. 19/18 in the polls and beat Mississippi St. in the Peach Bowl, its first bowl victory in 10 seasons. The Tar Heels posted victories over three ranked teams and closed the year winning five of its last six games. Means earned third-team All-America honors, racking up 1,195 yards and 13 TDs behind third-team All-America center Randall Parsons. Means, Parsons and punter Mike Thomas earned first-team All-ACC honors, while current co-defensive coordinator/linebackers coach Tommy Thigpen, DE Rondell Jones, OT Curtis Parker, and DB Bracey Walker claimed second-team honors.\n\nThe Tar Heels followed up the late run in 1992 with the first 10-win season of Brown’s tenure in ’93. Carolina earned a berth in the Gator Bowl and finished the year 10-3 and ranked No. 19/21 in the polls. Walker earned first-team All-America recognition for his play in the secondary, and the Heels had 14 All-ACC selections, the most for any Carolina team up to that point since the advent of All-ACC teams in 1953. In addition, Johnson was named league Rookie of the Year after posting 1,012 yards rushing and 14 TDs.\n\nAfter going 8-4 in 1994 and 7-5 in ’95, Brown revamped both sides of the ball and it led to the two most impressive seasons of his 10-year run. He compiled a 20-3 (.870) mark over the ’96 and ’97 seasons and posted two top-10 finishes.\n\nBrown’s ’96 squad went 10-2, beat No. 25 West Virginia in the Gator Bowl, and finished the season ranked 10th in both polls. The Carolina defense led the nation in points allowed, was second in total defense, and third against both the run and pass. Offensively, the Tar Heels established school records for passing touchdowns, produced an all-conference quarterback for the first time in 22 years, had a record four receivers with 30 or more catches, and Johnson posted over 900 yards and scored 10 TDs. Brown was named the ACC Coach of the Year and was a finalist for the Bear Bryant National Coach of the Year Award.\n\nUNC finished tied for second in the ACC and won on the road at both Syracuse and Houston. The Orangemen were ranked No. 9 in the country at the time and finished the year in a tie for the Big East Championship. Carolina held the Liberty Bowl-bound Cougars to more than 200 yards below their season average and passed for a school-record-tying five TDs. The Tar Heels held Florida State to its lowest point total in four years and lowest yardage mark in 10 years in a tightly contested battle against the nation’s then No. 1-ranked team in Tallahassee.\n\nJohnson set the ACC career record for all-purpose yards and Carolina marks for TDs and overall scoring. QB Chris Keldorf set numerous UNC passing marks and threw the fifth-most touchdown passes in ACC single-season history. Bly led the nation and set the ACC single-season record for INTs en route to first-team All-America and Thorpe Award Trophy (nation’s top defensive back) finalist honors. Ellis was named a second-team All-American, while Simmons was a semifinalist for the Butkus Award and a second-team All-American. TE Freddie Jones earned third-team All-America honors that year.\n\nIn 1997, Carolina posted a No. 4 final ranking in the USA Today/ESPN poll and a No. 6 ranking by the AP. Brown led Carolina to a 10-1 regular-season record, a second-place finish in the ACC, and a berth in the Gator Bowl, a game the Heels won under Carl Torbush.\n\nCarolina started the year reeling off eight consecutive wins and soaring to No. 5 in the nation. UNC averaged almost 30 points per game, while holding opponents to just over 12 heading into a showdown with No. 3 Florida St. The Heels weren’t able to break through against the Seminoles, but they rebounded to beat Clemson and Duke and secure the third 10-win season of Brown’s tenure.\n\nThe defense was nearly impenetrable in ‘97, allowing just 13 points (No. 5 NCAA) and 209.3 yards per game (No. 2 NCAA). The unit produced three first-team All-Americans in Bly, Ellis and Simmons, along with LB Kivuusama Mays, who earned third-team honors. Bly was a finalist for both the Nagurski Award (nation’s top defensive player) and the Thorpe Award, and Ellis was tabbed a finalist for the Lombardi Award (outstanding college lineman). Both Mays and Simmons were recognized by the Butkus Award (nation’s top linebacker) with Mays being a finalist and Simmons a semifinalist. In total, Carolina notched 10 All-ACC honors, seven on defense and three on offense.\n\nFollowing the ’97 regular season, Brown was hired to be the head coach of the Texas Longhorns on Dec. 4, 1997 and spent the next 16 seasons in Austin (1998-2013). With a mark at Texas of 158-48 (.767), the 2008 Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year and the 2009 Big 12 Coach of the Year elevated the Longhorns program to new heights. During his tenure, the Longhorns won the 2005 BCS National Championship and two conference titles, while winning or sharing Big 12 South Division titles six times. Brown’s 158 wins at Texas were the fourth-most in the nation from 1998-2013.\n\nBrown took over a UT program that managed at least 10 wins just three times in the 16 years prior to his arrival in 1998, but did so nine times in his 16 seasons, including a streak of nine consecutive that is the third-longest in NCAA history. Brown also led the Longhorns to six seasons of at least 11 wins.\n\nUnder Brown, Texas won nine of its last 12 bowl games and had a 10-5 record overall, including a UT record streak of 12 consecutive bowl appearances. In the 16 years prior to Brown's arrival, Texas went to nine bowls and was 2-7. The 10 bowl wins are the most in Texas history, eclipsing Darrell Royal's eight. In addition, the streak included a BCS National Championship, another BCS National Championship Game appearance and three BCS Bowl wins.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure in Austin, the Horns finished the year ranked in the Top 15 for 10 straight seasons from 2000-09. They also had seven Top-10 finishes and five Top-Five rankings. Prior to Brown's arrival, the last time Texas had finished the year in the Top 10 was 1983. In addition, from 1998-2013, Texas led the nation in all-time appearances in the BCS rankings with 104, ahead of both Oklahoma (100) and Florida (92).\n\nBrown's 12 consecutive seasons of at least nine wins were a UT first, as were his three back-to-back 11-win campaigns (2001-02, 2004-05, 2008-09), nine 10-victory seasons in a row, and three 12-win seasons (2005, '08, '09). UT produced a streak of Top 25 finishes for 12 years in a row, a first since the Horns earned eight final Top 25 rankings in a row from 1968-75. The Longhorns also created a streak of 10 straight Top-13 finishes, which is a UT record. The Horns claimed or shared the Big 12 South Division title six times over a 12-year period (1998-2009), including four conference championship game berths and two Big 12 titles.\n\nDuring his 16 seasons, the Longhorns featured a Heisman Trophy winner, two runners-up and a third-place finisher, three Maxwell Award winners, three WCFF Player of the Year Award winners, two Doak Walker Award winners, two Thorpe Award winners, two Nagurski Trophy winners, two O'Brien Award winners, two Hendricks Award winners, a Butkus Award winner, a Lombardi Award winner, two Manning Award winners, two Draddy/Campbell Trophy winners, a Wuerffel Trophy winner, a Disney Spirit Award winner, a FWAA Armed Forces Merit Award winner, 54 All-Americans, 73 first-team All-Big 12 selections, five Big 12 Offensive Players of the Year, six Big 12 Defensive Players of the Year and 12 Big 12 Freshman of the Year honorees.\n\nDefensively, Brown transformed a unit that ranked 85th nationally in total defense in 1997 into a group that led the nation in total defense and led the Big 12 in rushing, passing and scoring defense in 2001. That came on the heels of a pair of seasons that saw UT rank sixth nationally in total defense in 1999 and seventh in 2000. The 2008 defense also led the Big 12 in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense (third NCAA), while the 2009 unit led the nation in rushing defense and was third in total defense. In 2011, Texas again led the Big 12 in almost every major statistical category, including total defense (11th NCAA), rushing defense (sixth NCAA), pass efficiency defense (10th NCAA) and pass defense, while finishing second in scoring defense by just .15 points per game.\n\nDuring his tenure, Texas led the Big 12 in scoring defense three times, in total defense seven times, including four of his final six years, and rushing defense seven times, including five of his last eight seasons. The aggressive defensive style of the Brown era saw the Horns significantly increase their production in sacks, tackles for loss and turnovers forced, leading the Big 12 in each of those categories in 2012. In 2008, Texas led the nation in sacks and then tied for second in 2009, a year it also led the nation in turnovers gained and interceptions.\n\nOn offense, the Longhorns set 138 school records and featured the school's only 3,000-yard passers, 2,000-yard rusher, 1,000-yard receivers and 1,000-yard passer/rusher in a season. In 2008, Quan Cosby and Jordan Shipley combined to become the first duo in school history and just the 11th in NCAA history to each have 85-plus catches and 1,000-plus receiving yards in the same season. UT became just the second team in NCAA Division I-A history to boast a 2,000-yard rusher and passer as well as a 1,000-yard receiver in 1998. Brown became just the third head coach in NCAA Division I-A history to lead a player to a 3,000-yard passing season, a 2,000-yard rushing season and a 1,000-yard receiving season.\n\nTexas also re-established its home field advantage and, as a result, dominance under Brown. In his 16 seasons, the Longhorns increased their season ticket sales by nearly 45,000, up to a school-best 84,071 in 2010, set school attendance records while playing in front of sellout crowds in 74 of his final 84 home games, and attracted the top 33 crowds in UT history. With a full house on hand, UT went 80-17 in games at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, including a 46-12 mark in Big 12 home games, from 1998 to 2013. At one point, UT had a streak of 21 consecutive victories (third-longest in UT history) and the longest for UT since it won 42 straight from 1968-76 (No. 6 in NCAA history). The Longhorns also set the marks for the Big 12's longest intraconference winning streak (21 games) and the longest intraconference road winning streak (13).\n\nTexas lost only 15 road games in Brown's 16-year tenure with two of them coming in his first three games at UT. The Longhorns won 54 of their last 64 true road games. The Horns set a UT-record streak with 17 consecutive road wins before falling to Kansas State in 2006. UT also won 12 consecutive road games from 2000-02. Texas was 58-15 (.795) overall on the road and 48-8 (.857) versus unranked road foes during the Brown era. In fact, UT had a school-record 13-game nonconference road winning streak snapped in 2013 (at BYU). The previous mark of seven was set from 1956-63. Texas won 41 of its last 50 Big 12 Conference road games, including a league-record 13 consecutive conference road wins from 2002-06. The Horns were 45-11 (.804) in league road contests under Brown.\n\nBrown's on-the-field success had an impact on student-athlete’s future opportunities as well. From 2001-13, two of his Longhorns were selected in the first round in six of the 13 NFL Drafts. When OT Mike Williams (Buffalo Bills) and CB Quentin Jammer (San Diego Chargers) were selected fourth and fifth, respectively, in 2002, it marked the first time in UT history that two Longhorns were chosen among the first five overall picks. Brown's Longhorns featured a pair of first-round picks in 2004 when Roy Williams (seventh pick) was taken by the Detroit Lions and Marcus Tubbs was selected by the Seattle Seahawks (23rd pick). The 2005 NFL Draft had Longhorns Cedric Benson (fourth pick) and Derrick Johnson (15th pick) in the first round. In the 2006 NFL Draft, Vince Young (third pick) and Michael Huff (seventh pick) were both first-round choices, and in 2007, Michael Griffin (19th pick) and Aaron Ross (20th pick) were selected in the opening round.\n\nUT had four players selected in the first two rounds of the 2007 Draft with Justin Blalock and Tim Crowder chosen in the second round following Griffin and Ross. That marked the most Longhorns chosen in the first two rounds since 1982. Over his 16 years at UT, Brown had 71 players selected in the draft with 55 (77.5%) of those coming in the first four rounds.\n\nA focus on academics also helped UT student-athletes produce all-time highs in the classroom over his final eight years. The Longhorns led the Big 12 in academic all-conference selections in five of his last eight seasons. From 2006-13, UT totaled 159 Academic All-Big 12 selections.\n\nIn 2010, DE Sam Acho became Texas' second winner of the Campbell Trophy, which has been likened to an \"Academic Heisman.\" Acho also became the seventh Longhorn to be named two-time first-team Academic All-America. Texas registered two first-team Academic All-America honorees in Acho and OT Adam Ulatoski in 2009, after having also done so in 2007 with C Dallas Griffin and DT Derek Lokey. Griffin went on to earn UT's first Campbell Trophy, which at the time was named the Draddy Trophy. QB Colt McCoy was a finalist for that award in 2009 and recognized as a National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete, as were Griffin and Acho. In 2008, RB Chris Ogbonnaya also earned second-team Academic All-America honors. In 2013, that group was joined by deep snapper Nate Boyer, who earned his first Academic All-America nod.\n\nAlongside academics, Brown's life skills program featured numerous seminars to prepare student-athletes for life after football, while Longhorns players made countless visits to area children's hospitals and served as tutors and mentors at schools across Austin. Never was that as evident as with Acho, who was named the 2010 Wuerffel Trophy winner for all-around excellence, and the 2010 ARA Sportsmanship Award winner, along with being selected as a member of the AFCA Good Works Team. Emmanuel Acho then joined his brother as back-to-back honorees on the Good Works Team, giving Texas four in seven years along with Vince Young and Colt McCoy. Nate Boyer was also named the 2012 Disney Spirit Award winner as the most inspirational player in college football, and earned the 2013 FWAA Armed Services Award, while being named the 2013 NFF Legacy Award winner.\n\nOn the field, Brown guided the 2009 Longhorns to Texas' second National Championship Game appearance in five years and also matched the school record of 13 wins. The lone loss came in the title game to No. 1 Alabama after QB Colt McCoy was injured on the first series and did not return. Despite the loss of the National Player of the Year, Texas was within three points with the ball with just over three minutes remaining, and following the game, the polls kept the Longhorns ranked No. 2 -- their fourth Top Five ranking in six years. They also completed their ninth-consecutive 10-win season, which is the third-longest streak in NCAA history.\n\nMcCoy became UT's 20th unanimous All-American and won the Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Football Foundation National Player of the Year Award, Davey O'Brien Award, Manning Award and Unitas Golden Arm Award. He also became a two-time finalist for the Heisman Trophy. Shipley was a consensus All-America honoree and a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, while S Earl Thomas also earned consensus All-America honors and was a finalist for the Thorpe Award. Meanwhile, DE/LB Sergio Kindle became the first player in college football history to be named a finalist for both the Butkus Award and Hendricks Award, and also was named first-team All-America, along with C Chris Hall who was a finalist for the Rimington Trophy. In addition, K Hunter Lawrence was a semifinalist for the Groza Award and Sam Acho was a semifinalist for the Lott Trophy.\n\nTexas was one second from an undefeated season in 2008, finishing 12-1 and ranked No. 4 in the AP poll and No. 3 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. The Longhorns capped the year with a Fiesta Bowl victory over No. 10 Ohio State, producing a school-record fifth-consecutive bowl win, including three BCS victories. McCoy, who set the NCAA single-season record for completion percentage (77.6), earned first-team All-America honors and was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation Player of the Year and runner-up for the Heisman Trophy. On defense, DE Brian Orakpo became UT's 19th unanimous All-American and won the Nagurski Trophy, Lombardi Award and Hendricks Award. Shipley also earned third-team All-America honors, while Cosby was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award.\n\nIn 2007, the Longhorns capped their seventh consecutive 10-win season with a Holiday Bowl victory over No. 12 Arizona State, while also securing their fourth bowl win in consecutive years, a UT first. The Longhorns finished the season with a No. 10 national ranking in both polls, marking the fifth time in seven seasons they had finished in the Top 10. Along with Dallas Griffin winning the Draddy Trophy and two Academic All-Americans, OT Tony Hills earned first-team All-America honors from the Walter Camp Football Foundation, RB Jamaal Charles was named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker Award, S Marcus Griffin earned All-America honors from ESPN.com and DT Frank Okam was named third-team All-America by The Associated Press.\n\nThe 2006 Longhorns produced another 10-win season, finishing the year 10-3 after defeating Iowa in the Alamo Bowl. The Horns were ranked 13th in both polls at the end of year. Cornerback Aaron Ross won the Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back, and offensive lineman Justin Blalock was a finalist for both the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award. Ross and Blalock earned first-team All-America honors, while Hendricks Award finalist Tim Crowder and Lott Trophy semifinalist Michael Griffin were recognized as second-team All-Americans. McCoy, a redshirt freshman, earned National Freshman of the Year honors as he tied an NCAA record with 29 touchdown passes.\n\nBrown had the most successful season of his career in 2005, leading Texas to its first National Championship since 1970. Texas made a return trip to the Rose Bowl for its first appearance in the BCS National Championship game, where the Longhorns ended USC's 34-game winning streak and extended their own winning streak to 20 with a 41-38 victory. The team was led by Maxwell Award winner Vince Young. Young, who was also the Heisman runner-up and Davey O'Brien and Manning Award winner, finished his career as Texas' all-time winningest quarterback with a 30-2 record. Texas' offense set UT records in points scored (652) and total yards (6,657), while ranking first in the nation in scoring (50.2 ppg), second in rushing (274.9 ypg) and third in total offense (512.1 ypg). Texas was also highly ranked on defense. Led by UT's first-ever Thorpe Award winner Michael Huff, the Longhorns finished sixth in scoring defense (16.4 ppg) and 10th in total defense (302.9 ypg).\n\nIn 2004, the Longhorns managed their fourth consecutive 10-win season, while defeating six teams ranked in either the AP Poll or ESPN/USA Today Poll. It was also their third 11-win season in four years and was capped with Texas' first BCS selection and a Rose Bowl Championship over No. 13 Michigan. UT was led by All-Americans on both sides of the ball in senior RB and Doak Walker Award winner Cedric Benson and senior linebacker, Nagurski Trophy winner and Butkus Award winner Derrick Johnson.\n\nUnder his guidance in 2003, Texas rallied from a 4-2 start to post six straight victories and finished with a 10-3 record and a No. 12 national ranking. The Longhorns were led by a balanced offense and defense that was one of only four programs nationally that ranked among the NCAA's top 25 in total offense and total defense. Led by its first-ever Butkus Award finalist and consensus first-team All-American Derrick Johnson, UT's defense ranked 25th nationally allowing 329.9 yards per game.\n\nBrown's 2002 squad finished with an 11-2 record and a No. 6 final ranking, posting back-to-back 11-win seasons for the first time in school history and consecutive Top 10 finishes for the first time since 1977-78. Texas capped the year with a victory over LSU in the Cotton Bowl. The Longhorns also won or shared the Big 12 South title for the third time in the previous four seasons. Led by first-team All-American and Lombardi Trophy finalist DE Cory Redding and first-team All-Big 12 performers Johnson and CB Rod Babers, the Texas defense finished ranked among the nation's top 16 for the fourth straight year. WR Roy Williams and consensus first-team All-American OL Derrick Dockery both earned first-team All-Big 12 honors as the Horns averaged 33.8 points per game (16th NCAA).\n\nIn 2001, Texas claimed the Big 12 South title for the second time. The Horns were ranked among the nation's Top 10 in 16 of the 17 polls and only a narrow 39-37 defeat at the hands of No. 9 Colorado in the Big 12 Championship game prevented Brown's team from likely playing for the national title. With a victory against No. 21 Washington in the Holiday Bowl, Texas posted a school record-tying 11 victories (11-2) for the first time since '83 and just the fifth time in school history. The win also secured the program's first Top-10 finish since that year. Led by unanimous first-team All-American and UT's first-ever Thorpe Award finalist CB Quentin Jammer and All-Americans LB D.D. Lewis and Redding, the Longhorns topped the nation in total defense. Offensively, OT Mike Williams earned first-team All-America honors and was joined by Roy Williams as first-team All-Big 12 selections. Benson set freshman records for rushing yards and rushing TDs en route to Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year honors.\n\nUT’s 2000 team rallied from a 3-2 start to run off six consecutive victories. The Horns fell to No. 8 Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and closed out the year with a 9-3 record (7-1, Big 12) and a final No. 12 national ranking, its best finish in the polls since 1983. RB Hodges Mitchell, a first-team All-Big 12 choice for a second consecutive year, became the first player in UT history to gain 1,000 rushing and 300 receiving yards in a season. His path was paved by consensus first-team All-American and Outland Trophy finalist OT Leonard Davis. DT Casey Hampton earned his second first-team All-America honor and was Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nBrown's 1999 squad registered a 9-5 record, claimed the Big 12 South Division Championship, and finished the year ranked No. 21 by the AP and No. 23 in the Coaches poll. WR Kwame Cavil set UT and Big 12 records with 100 receptions for 1,188 yards en route to second-team All-America and first-team All-Big 12 honors. QB Major Applewhite set UT marks with 3,357 passing yards and 21 TDs while earning co-Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year recognition.\n\nIn 1998, running back Ricky Williams ran away with virtually every major college football award. Williams claimed the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp and Associated Press Player of the Year honors and the Dr. Pepper Doak Walker Award as Brown’s first Texas team finished 9-3 and ranked 15th nationally. The Horns snapped No. 7 Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak that year and defeated No. 25 Mississippi St. in the Cotton Bowl, the Longhorns' first New Year's Day bowl win since 1981.\n\nBorn in Cookeville, Tenn., Brown was a three-sport star at Putnam County High School, where he lettered three times in football. He went on to attend Vanderbilt (1969-70) and graduated from Florida State. He lettered twice as a running back for the Seminoles (1972-73). An injury sidelined him for much of the ‘73 season and that led to the start of his coaching career as he became a student coach. He completed his bachelor's degree in education in 1974 and went on to earn a master's degree in administration from Southern Miss in 1976.\n\nBrown began his full-time coaching career in 1975 at Southern Mississippi, where he worked with the receivers for three seasons. He earned a master's degree in administration from Southern Miss in 1976. Brown then coached the wide receivers at Memphis State in 1978 and at Iowa State in '79. He was promoted to offensive coordinator at Iowa State in 1980, and in his time in Ames, the Cyclones broke 17 school and Big Eight Conference offensive records and produced league leaders in rushing and total offense. Brown went on to lead the quarterbacks at LSU in 1982, when the Tigers went 8-2-1 and played Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\n\nIn just his 10th season of full-time coaching, Brown became a head coach, taking over the Appalachian St. program in 1983. At the age of 32, he directed the Mountaineers to their first winning record in four years with a 6-5 slate. After one season, he left to become offensive coordinator at Oklahoma. In his only year on Barry Switzer's staff, the Sooners were 9-2-1, won the Big Eight title, and earned a berth in the Orange Bowl. Brown helped Oklahoma develop its best passing attack in years, as he coached quarterbacks Danny Bradley, a first-team All-Big Eight selection, and Troy Aikman, a three-time Super Bowl Champion signal caller with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBrown became head coach at Tulane in 1985 and quickly went about rejuvenating the Green Wave's sagging football fortunes. Tulane had suffered three consecutive losing seasons before Brown's arrival, but by his third season in 1987, he led the Green Wave to a 6-5 mark and a berth in the Independence Bowl, just the program's fifth bowl game since 1940. That season, the Green Wave set school records for total offense and points, ranking 11th nationally in scoring (32.5 ppg). That remarkable season earned Brown a spot in the Independence Bowl Hall of Honor in 2002. He also served as athletics director his final two years at Tulane.\n\nOne of the most respected coaches in the game, Brown has served on numerous national committees, including president of the American Football Coaches Association. He has also served on the AFCA Ethics Committee and the AFCA Public Relations Committee. Brown has been a member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee and the NCAA Football Issues Committee. He has been chairman of the Football Coaches' Committee and a member of the Board of Directors of the College Football Association. Brown has been invited to coach in five postseason all-star games, including the Japan Bowl, Hula Bowl (twice) and East-West Shrine Game (twice). In March 2013, Brown was named the 2013 recipient of the Neyland Trophy, awarded annually by the Knoxville Quarterback Club for contributions to collegiate athletics.\n\nBrown and his wife, Sally, have four children -- Matt, Katherine, Barbara and Chris -- and six grandchildren -- Tyler, Mack, Bailey, Caroline, Janie and Truett. Sally has enthusiastically involved herself in football team activities. In 1999, she retired as president of Marin Development in North Carolina. She is past president of the Public, Private Partnership (PPP), an organization that fostered improved relations between the University of North Carolina and the town of Chapel Hill. She also volunteered time to chair the fundraising efforts for the UNC Black Cultural Center and was a member of a Carolina Alumni Advisory Committee.\n\nBrown's human touch and dedication to family is also evident in his involvement in the Austin community with Sally. In May 2012, they were named Couple of the Year at the Tenth Annual NFL Alumni Caring for Kids Banquet for their continued commitment to children, and for their overall commitment to be a charitable force in central Texas. The Browns served as honorary co-chairpersons of the Capital Campaign for the Helping Hands of Austin. They were instrumental in the opening of The Rise School of Austin (an early childhood education program that integrates children who have disabilities with their typically developing peers) and served on the school's Board of Directors. Because of the Browns' dedication and longstanding personal commitment to the Rise School, a plan to build a permanent 20,000 square foot facility was announced on August 26, 2011, called the \"Sally and Mack Brown Rise School of Austin.\" They lent their name along with the late legendary UT QB James Street to the annual James Street/Mack Brown Golf Tournament benefiting The Rise School.\n\nThe Browns also have contributed privately to numerous other causes in Austin, and in April 2011, Brown was named the Lady Bird Johnson Humanitarian Award Winner by the American Red Cross. In September 2008, he and Sally were named the Citizens of the Year for Caritas of Austin, which provides meals and aid for the homeless. The Browns themselves spent many hours serving food at Caritas.\n\nEarlier that year, The University of Texas honored Brown with The Mack Brown Distinguished Chair for Leadership in Global Affairs. The Chair is part of the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law, a university-wide global affairs research center named for renowned lawyer and public servant Ambassador Robert S. Strauss. The center is part of the LBJ School of Public Affairs.\n\nIn June 2007, Brown paired with Attorney General of Texas Greg Abbott to commend fathers who provide a nurturing home for their children, and asked dads from across the state to join in the fight against domestic abuse. In May 2009, Brown went on an eight-day trip to visit U.S. troops in Germany, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait, Djibouti and Spain as part of the Coaches Tour.\n\nThe Browns endorsed a Texas license plate, which was designed to raise public awareness for child abuse and neglect and the need for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers. After the Bonfire tragedy at Texas A&M in 1999, the couple initiated a blood drive on the UT campus that attracted more than 250 blood donors.\n\nThe Brown File\n\nBirthdate: Aug. 27, 1951\n\nHometown: Cookeville, Tenn.\n\nWife: Sally\n\nChildren: sons, Matt and Chris, and daughters, Katherine and Barbara\n\nGrandchildren: Tyler, Mack, Bailey, Caroline, Janie and Truett\n\nEducation\n\nCollege: Florida State '74 / Southern Miss '76\n\nBrown Coaching History\n\nYear School Record Bowl 2023 North Carolina 8-5 Duke's Mayo Bowl 2022 North Carolina 9-5 Holiday Bowl 2021 North Carolina 6-7 Duke's Mayo Bowl 2020 North Carolina 8-4 Orange Bowl 2019 North Carolina 7-6 Military Bowl 2013 Texas 8-5 Valero Alamo Bowl 2012 Texas 9-4 Valero Alamo Bowl 2011 Texas 8-5 Holiday Bowl 2010 Texas 5-7 -- 2009 Texas (AP: 2, USA Today: 2) 13-1 BCS National Championship 2008 Texas (AP: 4, USA Today: 3) 12-1 Fiesta Bowl 2007 Texas (AP: 10, USA Today: 10) 10-3 Holiday Bowl 2006 Texas (AP: 13, USA Today: 13) 10-3 Alamo Bowl 2005 Texas (AP: 1, USA Today/ESPN: 1) 13-0 Rose Bowl (BCS National Champions) 2004 Texas (AP: 5, USA Today/ESPN: 6) 11-1 Rose Bowl 2003 Texas (AP: 12, USA Today/ESPN: 11) 10-3 Holiday Bowl 2002 Texas (AP: 6, USA Today/ESPN: 7) 11-2 Cotton Bowl 2001 Texas (AP: 5, USA Today/ESPN: 5) 11-2 Holiday Bowl 2000 Texas (AP: 12, USA Today/ESPN: 12) 9-3 Holiday Bowl 1999 Texas (AP: 21, USA Today/ESPN: 23) 9-5 Cotton Bowl 1998 Texas (AP: 15, USA Today/ESPN: 16) 9-3 Cotton Bowl 1997 North Carolina (AP: 6, USA Today/ESPN 4 10-1 Gator Bowl 1996 North Carolina (AP: 10, USA Today/CNN 10) 10-2 Gator Bowl 1995 North Carolina 7-5 Carquest Bowl 1994 North Carolina 8-4 Sun Bowl 1993 North Carolina (AP: 19, USA Today/CNN 21) 10-3 Gator Bowl 1992 North Carolina (AP: 19, USA Today/CNN 18) 9-3 Peach Bowl 1991 North Carolina 7-4 -- 1990 North Carolina 6-4-1 -- 1989 North Carolina 1-10 -- 1988 North Carolina 1-10 -- 1987 Tulane 6-6 Independence Bowl 1986 Tulane 4-7 -- 1985 Tulane 1-10 -- 1984 Oklahoma (OC) -- -- 1983 Appalachian St. 6-5 -- 1982 LSU (QBs) -- -- 1981 Iowa St. (OC) -- -- 1980 Iowa St. (OC) -- -- 1979 Iowa St. (WRs) -- -- 1978 Memphis St. (WRs) -- -- 1977 Southern Miss (WRs) -- -- 1976 Southern Miss (WRs) -- -- 1975 Southern Miss (WRs) -- -- 1974 Florida St. (Student: WRs) -- -- 1973 Florida St. (Student: WRs) -- -- Total: 46 years (35 as HC) 282-149-1 27 Bowl Games (15-12)\n\nTrophy Time\n\nBrown's winners, finalists and semifinalists\n\nHeisman Trophy Position Player Year RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998 QB Colt McCoy Runner-up 2008 QB Vince Young Runner-up 2005 QB Colt McCoy Third place 2009\n\nMaxwell Award Position Name Year QB Colt McCoy Winner 2009 QB Vince Young Winner 2005 RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998 QB Colt McCoy Finalist 2008 QB Drake Maye Semifinalist 2022 QB Sam Howell Semifinalist 2020 RB Javonte Williams Semifinalist 2020\n\nWalter Camp Player of the Year Position Name Year QB Colt McCoy Winner 2009 QB Colt McCoy Winner 2008 RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998 QB Drake Maye Semifinalist 2022\n\nAssociated Press Player of the Year Position Name Year RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998\n\nCingular/ABC Sports Player of the Year Position Name Year QB Colt McCoy Winner 2009 QB Vince Young Winner 2005 RB Cedric Benson Winner 2004\n\nSporting News Player of the Year Position Name Year QB Colt McCoy co-Winner 2008 RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998\n\nChevrolet Offensive Player of the Year Position Name Year QB Colt McCoy Winner 2008 RB Ricky Williams Winner 1998\n\nNagurski Trophy Position Name Year DE Brian Orakpo Winner 2008 LB Derrick Johnson Winner 2004\n\nBiletnikoff Award Position Name Year WR Jordan Shipley Finalist 2009 WR Josh downs Semifinalist 2022 WR Josh downs Semifinalist 2021 WR Dyami Brown Semifinalist 2020 WR Quan Cosby Semifinalist 2008 WR Roy Williams Semifinalist 2002, '03 WR Kwame Cavil Semifinalist 1999\n\nButkus Award Position Name Year LB Derrick Johnson Winner 2004 LB Sergio Kindle Finalist 2009 LB Derrick Johnson Finalist 2003 LB Kivuusama Mays Finalist 1997 LB Keenan Robinson Semifinalist 2011 LB Keenan Robinson Semifinalist 2010 LB Derrick Johnson Semifinalist 2002 LB D.D.
