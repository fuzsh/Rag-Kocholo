        "text": "The beloved (former) Dexter star has joined the 'Dexter: Original Sin' team!\n\nMichael C. Hall is back in the house Dexter folks! No, he won't be reprising his role as Dexter Morgan, but he will be working as Executive Producer alongside his old pals Clyde Philips and Scott Reynolds.\n\nAfter 15 months of waiting, Showtime revealed the first three cast members that will be joining the highly anticipated Dexter prequel which in now called Dexter: Original Sin (its working title was 'Dexter: Origins'). Christian Slater and Molly Brown will be playing Harry and Debra respectively, and Patrick Gibson has been cast as America's favorite fictional serial killer Dexter Morgan.\n\nOther executive producers are Mary Leah Sutton (Resident Evil), Tony Hernandez (Emily In Paris), Lilly Burns (Russian Doll). Dexter: Original Sin is produced by Robert Lloyd Lewis (The Lincoln Lawyer). The directing executive producer will be Michael Lehmann (Heathers).\n\nAccording to Showtime's announcement, 'Original Sin' follows Dexter \"as he transitions from student to avenging serial killer. When his bloodthirsty urges can't be ignored any longer, Dexter must learn to channel his inner darkness. With the guidance of his father, Harry (played by Christian Slater), he adopts a Code designed to help him find and kill people who deserve to be eliminated from society without getting on law enforcements' radar. This is a particular challenge for young Dexter as he begins a forensics internship at the Miami Metro Police Department.\""
