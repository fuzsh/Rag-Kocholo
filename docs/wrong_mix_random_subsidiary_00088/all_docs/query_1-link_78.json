In fact, the village and stores on the 3200 block of P Street have caught the attention of American Express for its annual Small Business Saturday promotions.\n\nAs Small Business Saturday celebrates its fifth anniversary, American Express chose Washington, D.C., along with four other cities to celebrate the businesses that keep these neighborhoods thriving.\n\nOn Nov. 29, for the first time, the American Express Main Street Makeover initiative will pair “Main Streets” with a professional designer who will re-do and decorate the door and window fronts of small businesses in time for the holidays and Christmastime.\n\nInterior designer Sheila Bridges will design and execute the makeover for P Street where she will emphasize the following business: Anthony’s Tuxedos & Wedding Creations (3237 P St., NW), upscale consignment boutique Ella-Rue (3231 P St., NW), contemporary art gallery P Street Gallerie (3235 P St., NW), specialty store Just Paper & Tea (3232 P St., NW) and children’s clothing boutique Little Birdies (3236 P St., NW).\n\n“I chose P Street in Georgetown not only because of its obvious historic charm (It is a beautiful tree lined street with cobblestones, trolley tracks and brick sidewalks) but also because of the sense of community that seems to exist amongst all of the small, independent retailers who have businesses on that block,” said Sheila.\n\n“I loved that there were storeowners who had been there for 30 plus years and others who had only been there for a few months. Everyone seemed supportive of one another,” Bridges add.\n\nBridges traveled to Georgetown last week to talk with business owners and to get a better understanding of her canvas. Once she was able to see her vision, she talked to shop owners and began her planning.\n\n“We were just flattered to even be chosen,” said Krista Johnson, owner of Ella-Rue. “So, I think most of us just let Sheila do her thing.”\n\nBridges went with a reindeer theme for all five stores, each varying in style. For Little Birdies, the children’s clothing boutique, the reindeers will have more of a whimsical feel, contrasting with Ella-Rue and Anthony’s Tuxedos which will have a more mature look.\n\nIn recognition of the holidays and Small Business Saturday, most of the shops will offer holiday-themed merchandise and discounts. Ella-Rue is taking 10 percent off all American Express purchases. With refreshed storefronts and window displays, American Express and retailers hope to attract consumers to shop at these local businesses this holiday season.\n\nAlso, if customers register their American Express card on its website, they become eligible for its “Spend $10, Receive $10” sweepstakes. Spend $10 or more on Nov. 29, and receive a statement credit for each qualifying transaction within 90 days thereafter.\n\nWe Know Carol Schwartz. She Just Wants to Be Mayor\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nThe scene looked and sounded familiar.\n\nWalking into Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café on Connecticut Avenue last week for a lunchtime interview, mayoral candidate Carol Schwartz was greeted by a couple of diners with a “We’re voting for you, Carol.” After the interview, riding on the 42 bus, a woman recognized her and introduced her as a candidate for mayor of the District of Columbia, urging passengers to vote for her.\n\nThis is nothing new for Carol Schwartz. Those shout-outs are echoes of all of her previous campaigns in the city, running for school board, and the city council, where she occupied the lone non-Democratic Party seat for a period of 16 years as well as four mayoral runs.\n\nPeople know Carol Schwartz.\n\nShe is not alone either—this campaign, long-running since the April primary and slow to gain traction and has seen all three candidates fanning out into forays into the city’s neighborhoods for one-on-one contacts, to street corners and Metro Stops, going door to door, or to meet and greets. Schwartz, Muriel Bowser, the Democratic Primary winner back in April, and David Catania, the long-time, at-large District councilmember, have made it a point to get personal face time with prospective voters throughout the city. Catania and Schwartz, both former Republicans, are running as Independents.\n\nFor Schwartz, it’s a little more simple.\n\nPeople really do know Carol Schwartz, and not just from her travels throughout the city in this campaign. And it’s fair to say that the people who know her, like her. This good will and warmth may or may not translate into votes. Schwartz is hoping it does. This is likely the most engaging, appealing and effective part of her campaign.\n\n“I’m telling you, I feel like I have the energy of a teenager,” Schwartz said over lunch. “It’s just there. I get by on four hours of sleep a night. You get up, and you’re raring to go.”\n\nShe says she did not decide to run on a whim, or out of some lingering anger over her last campaigns, six years ago, in which she lost the Republican Primary, and then lost a write-in campaign. Some media observers have called her decision to run an exercise in nostalgia, which she dismisses.\n\n“I want to be mayor of this city,” she said. “I know with all my heart that I would be a great mayor, and I have the experience to prove it. “\n\nHer experience is deep and real and runs across a broad range of issues. On the District Council, where she served a total of four terms, she chaired committees on public works and the environment, on local, regional and federal affairs. While being a Republican, she often and consistently seemed more progressive than her Democratic colleagues.\n\nShe served as chair of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments’ Board of Directors as well as president. In 2004, she chaired COG’s National Capital Region Emergency Preparedness Council. The former special education teacher calls herself the real education candidate.\n\nAll the major candidates who are running claim across-the-board support among whites, African Americans, women, minorities and gays, but Schwartz can claim that she’s gotten that support in previous city-wide campaigns. Although she was defeated in all of her mayoral campaigns—three against Mayor Marion Barry and one against Anthony Williams—she rang up impressive numbers across the city as a Republican candidate.\n\nSchwartz came to Washington as an energetic young Jewish woman from Texas. She was smitten right away. “I have had a life-long love affair with this city,” she said, more than once. She began political life as a Republican. (“I was and am a fiscal conservative,” she said.) She is certainly one of the most progressive and often liberal Republican you ever saw, when it came to social issues, help for the homeless, the unemployed, the underserved of this city and the working class.\n\n“When I lost the primary, and then the write-in, well, okay, that was that,” she said, referring to her 2008 council campaign. “I wasn’t all that eager to get back into politics.” But she continued her life-long volunteer activities—Whitman Walker board member, Washington Animal Rescue League, Metropolitan Police Boys and Girls Club—because, she said, “if there are opportunities to take care of a problem, then I want to be there.”\n\nYet, here she is, a live wire and optimistic and full of fire, even though all the polls that have surfaced put her solidly in third place. She is not backing away. She’s not discouraged, even as time runs out on the campaign. “I know about the polls, but when you’re out there, there’s something different going on,” she said. “There’s . . . I don’t know . . . something going on underneath. I think I can still win. I really do.”\n\nShe’s been talking a lot about Washington as a tale of two cities—in particular the income gap, the great disparity between the have and have-nots. To that end, she’s promised to create a mayor’s office for disparity solutions.\n\nShe’s running against the wind—she’s her own campaign manager, with her daughter Hilary, who is a professional standup comedian, as co-manager. Another daughter, Stephanie, is an attorney, and her son Doug is a singer, songwriter and author.\n\nWe asked her about the possibility if she would consider running for the District Council in the future, should she not win Tuesday, Schwartz replied, “I’m not thinking about the future right now. I’m running for mayor right now.”\n\nIna Ginsburg, Arts and Fashion Patron, Warhol Muse, Dies at 98\n\nRobert Devaney •\n\nIna Ginsburg, who fled Nazi Europe to emigrate to the United States and went on to become one of the tastemakers of Washington society, died Nov. 9 at her Washington, D.C., home at the age of 98.\n\nThe stylish and social Ginsburg intersected with the careers of artist Andy Warhol, who drew her in several silk-screen portraits, and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also hailed from her native Austria — and with many of the movers and shakers in Georgetown and Washington during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nGinsburg hosted parties at her Georgetown home which she shared with her second husband, David Ginsburg, a Washington insider, whom he met after the end of World War II in Europe when he was with the U.S. Army. Later, she worked as the Washington editor for Warhol’s Interview Magazine in the 1980s, when it branded Washington as “Hollywood on the Potomac.”\n\nA supporter of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Ginsburg was also a founding member of the Washington National Opera and trustee of the American Film Institute. She also brought art into the Federal Reserve’s headquarters and helped to begin the Fed’s fine arts board.\n\nInterviewed herself and written about by other publications, Ginsburg was often in the pages of The Georgetowner as well. She was last seen on its website in an Oct. 8 story about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg being presented with the Institute for Education’s 2014 Cultural Diplomacy Award.\n\n“Ina was an integral part of Washington at its very best,” said photographer Didi Cutler. “Intelligent, glamorous, sophisticated , artistic and creative, she was a passionate supporter of the arts. A warm and gracious hostess, she entertained in great style. I felt privileged to be among her many friends.”\n\nKevin Chaffee, senior editor at Washington Life, said: “Ina was one of the most sophisticated and fashionable women in Washington for well over a half-century and also one of the wittiest and most intelligent. After I read her stories in Andy Warhol’s Interview back in the Reagan years, she would tell me all the stuff she didn’t dare put in! Later, she was a great source for my own pieces. She was a major character — the last of the best in so many ways.”\n\nBorn Ida Spira in Vienna on Oct. 10, 1916, Ginsburg is survived by her three children — Jonathan Ginsburg of Fairfax, Va., Susan Ginsburg of Alexandria, Va., and Mark Ginsburg of Berlin — and by two grandchildren.\n\nOpen Friday for Ice Skating: Washington Harbour, NGA Sculpture Garden Ice Rink\n\nAnders Kristofer Ohm •\n\nNovember to March is ice skating season, and the cold of Polar Vortex is showing up right on time.
