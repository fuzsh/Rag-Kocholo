        "text": "Bruno Dubois\n\nHoward Steel Lecturer\n\nBruno Dubois (BEL/CAN) understands the challenges of managing high performance sports teams in one of the most dangerous sporting environments -- around the world, high-speed yacht racing.\n\nA former sailmaker and professional sailor with more than 250,000 miles of sailing, Bruno has established himself as one of the leading names in the sport, called upon to lead teams at the highest level.\n\nAfter 40 years in business, combining top-level racing with sales across Europe and North America, he became more aware of his strengths, and weaknesses. He loved the buzz of starting new projects, the discovery process, and getting everything set-up and in place, but the quickly realized if he would delegate work to those who are more qualified, he was far more successful in bringing these projects to fruition.\n\nUsing this experience, he established three rules when approaching a new project. First, choose people with better skills than your own to be part of the team. Second, create a structure as flat as possible, but with visionary leadership. And third, bring rigid flexibility. Make sure there is clarity in exact roles and responsibilities but invite interest from everyone across all departments.\n\nThis was very apparent when he was as Sailing Team Manager of China’s Dongfeng Racing Team’s Volvo Ocean Race. Their win in 2018 surprised many, and reflected Bruno’s ability to recruit, manage, and motivate an international team of women and men, helping them to bond, compete, and exceed all expectations.\n\nOver the past few years, the business of sport has been growing and developing, with leagues, sponsors, and teams looking to achieve more than just success on the water – very similar to how many businesses are also looking for their point of difference. His involvement in this sport encouraged him to pursue a postgraduate degree in performance coaching to better understand what sets apart a good athlete from a winning athlete.\n\nWhen sharing his journey and experiences, he regals audiences with stories from the depths of the Southern Ocean to the high-tech computer simulators to showcase why disruption matters, why delegation brings experience, and how to define the small difference between first and second.\n\nSteven Glassman\n\nHarrington Lecturer\n\nDr. Glassman did his undergraduate training at Princeton University (Princeton, NJ).

He started a spine practice in 2006, partnering with Dr. Oheneba Boachie-Adjei and FOCOS. That year he got 20 new deformity patients, with 11 operated at FOCOS in Ghana.

Patients cross the border from Eritrea and travel by bus for 3 days to reach his spine clinic. A patient who could not afford busfare walked for 8 days from NW Ethiopia. Daily he sees the natural history of untreated spine deformities. Neurofibromatosis, diastomatomyelia, complex congenital and TB deformities are common.

His goal is to establish a national spine center in Ethiopia. Please consider volunteering!"
