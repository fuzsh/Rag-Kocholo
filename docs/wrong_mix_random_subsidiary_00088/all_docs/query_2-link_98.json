        "text": "‘The real problem of humanity is that we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology.’\n\nE.O. Wilson\n\nThis course examines 3 recently developed ‘godlike technologies’ - artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain and synthetic biology- that have passed commercial viability and are on-track to change the foundations of business and society by 2035.\n\nThese technologies predict behavior and increasingly create behavior. They learn and improve relentlessly. They make better decisions than humans in an increasing number of contexts. They are unconstrained by moral boundaries. Are these technologies different from other ground-breaking technologies such as electricity, nuclear power and computing? What commercial opportunities and risks will they create for business leaders? What ethical choices will they force business leaders to confront?\n\nIn November 2022, the introduction of ChatGPT brought the potential and power of Generative AI into public consciousness. It was downloaded by over 100 million people globally over the next 6 weeks. Business leaders, regulators, and professionals wonder how this magical technology would affect their business models. Workers in both creative and other professional career wonder how it will affect their livelihoods. Governments around the world, are waking up to the power of the technology to disrupt the established order. Venture Capitalists have lined up to fund over 500 startups that use Generative AI. CEO’s of some of the leading AI companies have gone on record to say that this generation of AI could destroy human society. Others have said that it could create a global utopia by solving intractable problems like climate change, ending the need for humans to work for a living and bringing the cost of energy to zero. Why are normally balanced leaders taking such extreme and opposite positions?\n\nAt about the same time that ChatGPT was growing explosively the Web 3 and crypto markets, that had been seen as the big disruptive force for society a year earlier, were limping through a crypto winter. Companies that had been slated to restructure financial market declared bankruptcy. Leaders like Sam Bankman-Fried who declared the birth of a new distributed era where our notions of ‘value’ and money itself would be redefined, were under house arrest for fraud.\n\nFurther in the background, a quiet revolution has been taking place in reengineering life itself. Several companies have been using CRISPR-based technologies to reprogram living organisms, promising a new, unimaginable future where humans capabilities could be enhanced, aging could be reversed, new forms of life created, and new custom designed materials could be grown rather than manufactured. Companies like Verve Therapeutics announced the first human trials of a single shot cure for all heart attacks through a one-time change in a single gene. In most of these cases, business choices like market selection, financing strategy and pricing are critical determinants of the value of the technology to humanity.\n\nThe course will give students an understanding of these three 3 emerging technologies from the perspective of a business leader, preparing students for a world where technology creates exponential increases in capabilities, forcing business leaders to rethink business models and reassess the commercial and ethical choices they make.\n\nWe will explore:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) – Bringing the cost of cognition to zero (approximately 50 percent of class sessions): We cover the application of AI to a number of early and late stage companies and look at the ways in which AI can be used and misused. We look at foundational companies like DeepMind, Open AI and Anthropic as well as specialized companies like Videa Health, Metaphysic and Instadeep that are applying AI to more specific problems (Dentistry, Movie/TV production, Route optimization etc.) We also look at the power of algorithms to shape consumer behavior (TikTok), the misuse of AI in social contexts such as in the justice system and the industrialization of misinformation and hacking of elections. How can business leaders create great companies that enhance the value to society while earning a return for shareholders?\n\nBlockchain – Changing mechanisms for coordination and trust (approximately 20 percent of class session): We cover the under revolutionary promise of blockchain technologies to lower the cost of transactions and create new markets and new communities. Companies are issuing their own currencies, enabling distributed autonomous governance processes, enabling self-enforcing contracts, creating new forms of value capture (NFT’s for example) and, most of all, moving the provision of trust from institutions and governments to network protocols that have no central authority. They challenge the core notions of brand value, scale, regulatory guardrails, hierarchy, incentives etc. The classes cover companies like Polygon, Ava Labs that provide the platform for others to build new platforms for cooperation, companies like Uniswap that have the potential to restructure financial exchanges, Circle Financial , a company that is reimagining what digital money could be and Art Blocks a company that is redefining digital art and creating a way for artists to capture value from their art.\n\nSynthetic Biology – Enabling us to reprogram DNA and rewrite the code of life (25% of sessions): We examine the potential for gene editing and other forms of computational biology to change healthcare and manufacturing. By making DNA programable, these companies are creating a foundation layer for creating new materials, new therapeutic approaches and new forms of life that can be designed to solve particular problems (tiles that absorb CO2, bacteria that eat the microplastics in the ocean etc.) We look at companies like Twist Bioscience, that will design and manufacture DNA to order, Moderna that can use AI and digital technologies to create new therapeutics rapidly, and companies from Prof. George Church’s Labs that are pushing the frontiers of biology (recreating the Woolly mammoth from ancient DNA), extending health lifespans – ‘curing the disease of aging’.\n\nWe also look at feeder technologies that act as accelerants to the core technologies. These include ubiquitous networks that collect data on everything including what happens inside our bodies and brains, new models of computing that can be orders of magnitude faster than today’s fastest computers in certain calculations, Brain Computer Interfaces that enable us to augment our brains. On the negative side we examine and the business models of companies that are using these technologies to disrupt society through applications like Ransomware.\n\nApproximately 60% of class sessions are case-based, and 60% of sessions feature industry experts and case protagonists. There are a few lecture / Q&A sessions to explain the core concepts and mechanics of the three technologies. There is a final paper in lieu of an exam.\n\nCopyright © 2023 President & Fellows of Harvard College. All Rights Reserved.\n\nRequirements: active, insightful class and negotiation exercise participation; paper or take-home final exam.\n\nRevised: This course serves both as a sophisticated follow-on to basic negotiation courses and/or as a self-contained negotiation course taught at an advanced level with a heavy emphasis on handling challenging real-world cases. Unlike past versions of this course, there is no formal pre- or co-requisite, although an introductory negotiation course at one of Harvard’s professional schools or equivalent elsewhere will be beneficial and will offer more basic skill-building exercises. Those without prior negotiation coursework should read 3D Negotiation by Lax and Sebenius in its entirety before class begins to become familiar with key concepts and terminology that others who have taken an earlier negotiation course will already bring to the course.\n\nPurpose: Take your negotiating ability to the next level by matching wits with some of the world’s greatest dealmakers and diplomats as they work through their toughest deals. Examples:\n\nIn business and finance: Steve Schwarzman on several early make-or-break deals for Blackstone; Sarah Frey negotiates advantageous supplier deals for her tiny farm with a vindictive Walmart enroute to building an agricultural empire; Bruce Wasserstein negotiates to take Lazard public, etc.\n\nIn diplomacy: Christiana Figueres guides the Paris climate talks to a near-unanimous agreement in 2015; Colombian President Juan Santos ends a 50-year civil war with the FARC guerillas; US Trade Negotiator Charlene Barshefsky takes on IP negotiations with China; former US Secretaries of State Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Hillary Clinton describe critical moments in their negotiations with Vladimir Putin, etc.\n\nIn the arts and sports: Music industry lawyer John Branca negotiates the purchase of the Beatles catalog; Artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude negotiate with endless opponents to build “Running Fence,” The Gates in Central Park, and to wrap Paris’s Pont Neuf in golden fabric; Proponents of a “European Super League” try to form a breakaway football/soccer league, etc. etc.\n\nA typical case challenges you to address its critical deal moments. For most cases in the course, we watch excerpts from stop action video interviews, mostly that I’ve conducted with the protagonist(s) describing how they handled a series of key decisions. After discussion of each such decision, we move to the next critical moment, and so on . . . after which we draw broader lessons. We often find that insights from private sector dealmaking inform public and not-for-profit sector negotiations and vice versa.\n\nThe objective of this approach is to extract highly practical lessons from studying the world’s greatest negotiators at work on their most challenging deals—in business, finance, diplomacy, the not-for-profit world, and across sectors. Since 2001, the Program on Negotiation—an interuniversity consortium involving Harvard, MIT, and Tufts—has regularly bestowed the “Great Negotiator Award” on men and women from around the world who have consistently overcome formidable barriers to achieve truly worthwhile purposes. In a closely related project at Harvard, faculty have conducted detailed interviews with former American Secretaries of State—Henry Kissinger, George Shultz James A. Baker, III, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Rex Tillerson—about their most difficult negotiations. As chair of the Great Negotiators Award program and co-chair of the American Secretaries of State initiative, I am deeply involved in a multi-year project to systematically distill the strategies and tactics of this distinguished group (along with several other remarkable negotiators). The emerging findings of this ongoing project will heavily inform this course. By way of highly interactive case discussions, frequently interspersed with video clips of the protagonists, and a few negotiation exercises—although considerably fewer such simulations relative to many introductory negotiation courses—Advanced Negotiation will develop valuable lessons and skills for dealmaking and dispute resolution that go well beyond those offered in basic courses.\n\nCareer Focus\n\nThis course is designed for students who expect to analyze and participate effectively in challenging business, financial, diplomatic, and not-for-profit negotiations, often with public-private and cross-border aspects. Of the cases, exercises, videos, and significant examples in the course, roughly a third could be classified in a mainly business/financial/entrepreneurial category, a third could be classified in a mainly public/diplomatic/not-for-profit category, and a third would involve a mixture of private, public and/or not-for-profit parties that played meaningful roles.\n\nCourse Content and Organization\n\nThroughout this course, a central theme is how to deal with difficult negotiators and genuinely hard negotiations in many different settings. Different aspects of meeting this challenge will be developed. One focus will be on \"at-the-table\" tactics for handling hardball moves, incompatible positions, adversarial relationships, ideological differences, the lack of vital information, and cross-cultural frictions. A second thread explores how sophisticated deal design moves can overcome impasses in order to create maximum value on a sustainable basis. A third consistent emphasis develops advanced concepts and skills for making effective \"away-from-the-table\" setup moves, especially to meet the challenges of cross-border negotiations and those that play out over time. Such challenges typically occur both \"across the table\" in negotiating \"externally\" with the other side(s) as well as \"internally\" within each side. Beyond doing individual deals, the course will explore how great negotiators often envision and carry out effective multi-front, sequential “negotiation campaigns” that culminate in achieving a target deal or deals with sufficient support for implementation and sustainability. Specific course modules that develop the above concepts include 1) introduction and course themes, 2) creating and claiming value, 3) preparing for tough negotiations, 4) dealing effectively with hard bargainers, 5) Two-level games/internal and external negotiations, and 6) Multiparty negotiations across borders and over times.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nBeyond constructive participation in class and faithfully preparing for and carrying out negotiation exercises, most students will opt for a self-scheduled written exam. Instead of taking a final exam, some students may prefer to write a paper on the kind of negotiation about which you care intensely or about a “great negotiator” whom you wish to study in depth. Since, inevitably, the class sessions won’t cover your specific areas of greatest interest in the kind of depth you might wish, the paper option provides the chance to do so for yourself and to build personally relevant intellectual capital. The major criterion for the paper is that it treats your topic in a sophisticated manner from a negotiation-analytic standpoint, and that it teaches you and me something significant about effective dealmaking.\n\nImportant: If you are interested in cross-registering for this course, it is imperative that you follow the HBS process, especially its timetable, which can be found here.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPurpose - Who Should Take this Course?\n\nThe purpose of ALD is to help you become more effective, authentic individuals, and leaders. We do this by carving out some sacred time and space in your busy lives to engage in a rigorous, theoretically-supported, meaningful conversation about who you are and the purpose of your leadership. This is a different kind of work. You cannot do it alone. Do not take this course unless you are open to sharing personal insights, experiences, ambitions, and fears both in class and in your Leader Development Groups (LDGs).\n\nALD requires an unusually high degree of curiosity, reflection, and interpersonal openness. You will be asked to think differently and explore new behaviors. We expect you to be absolutely honest with yourself and others. While few of our students are completely comfortable or sure about this type of work coming in, you must be at least open to experimenting with a different kind of learning. This is the bare minimum for joining ALD. Those who are not fully committed to investing in this course end up wasting their time. More importantly, they waste the valuable time and effort of others. We invite you to be “all in.”\n\nWhy Should You Take this Course?\n\nIf you spend time reflecting on some of the following challenges, you might consider taking ALD:\n\nI am 26 years old; I have lived for my resume. I am proud of what I have accomplished, but is that really all there is to it? What do I live for now?\n\nI seek public success and approval; my achievement masks deeper insecurities.\n\nI need to appear “strong” and “perfect.” I rarely open up or ask for help. These actions are signs of weakness to me.\n\nWhy do I obsess about my image? Why do I care so much about what others think of me?\n\nWhy am I afraid to tell you who I really am?\n\nI obsess about status and money, but don’t have the courage to pursue my personal passions. I’m not even sure anymore what they are.\n\nRequirements\n\nAttend one 80-minute class each week for thirteen weeks on Tuesdays in assigned classrooms (please note exceptions for the first week and the week of 7 Novermber).\n\nAttend one, two-hour-long meeting per week with a six-person Leader Development Group (LDG). LDGs are held the afternoon of class between 5:30 and 7:30 pm. Rotating facilitators are drawn from the group. LDGs will be assigned in advance by your professor with the intent of creating diverse groups.\n\nSubmit a reflective essay each week via Canvass. Reflections are due NLT midnight on the day following your class. Your reflection should be no less than one paragraph and no more than 2 pages double-spaced (think blog). This reflection is due even if you are the group facilitator that week.\n\nIn lieu of an exam, students will write a final paper on the purpose of their leadership, as well as complete and submit a Personal Leadership Development Plan (PLDP).\n\nGrading\n\nThere are three graded requirements:\n\nClass participation\n\nWeekly reflections\n\nFinal Essay & Personal Leadership Development Plan (PLDP)\n\nThere is one simple overarching criterion for assessing performance in all three areas:\n\nAre you “all in”? Are you deeply engaged in this different kind of work? Are you giving this your best shot?\n\nCourse Premise\n\nIn its simplest form, here is the theoretical premise for ALD:\n\nTo the extent that you have a clearer sense of:\n\nwho you are, your life story, your values & principles, your motivations and passions, your leadership purpose, your True North,\n\nWhen it comes time to lead you will be more likely to:\n\nstep up,\n\nlead effectively, and\n\nlive a more integrated & meaningful life.\n\nCourse Goals:\n\nOverarching: Increased CLARITY (self-awareness) & COMFORT (self-acceptance)\n\nDetailed:\n\nIncrease your self-awareness by engaging the “big questions” in life, with the goal to live with greater mindfulness and intentionality.\n\nHelp you uncover personal patterns, decide which ones serve you well (accept and commit to them), and which ones don’t (commit to changing them).\n\nLearn how to participate more fully in open, intimate small-group discussions. Learn how to “listen deeply” to others, to be “fully there” for them.\n\nGain some clarity about your leadership purpose, values, and motivations, and the role these play when leading others.\n\nBecome more honest (and comfortable) with yourself in all dimensions of life.\n\nLearn how to empower, engage, and inspire others.\n\nBe able to more fully imagine the reality of others.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nDrawing broadly from the fields of positive psychology, sociology, adult development, and leadership, you will be exposed to a powerful collection of theoretical frameworks and concepts all selected to support your progress in line with ALD Course Goals. Additionally, you will learn a set of foundational skills essential to the practice of authentic leadership. Finally, you will engage in several rigorous processes designed to support your continued growth and development throughout your life. Here is the course outline for ALD:\n\nLesson 1:\n\nAuthentic Leader Development\n\nLesson 2:\n\nLife Story\n\nLesson 3:\n\nLosing Your Way\n\nLesson 4:\n\nCrucibles\n\nLesson 5:\n\nDevelop Your Self-Awareness\n\nLesson 6:\n\nPractice Your Values\n\nLesson 7:\n\nDifficult Conversations\n\nLesson 8:\n\nFind Your Sweet Spot\n\nLesson 9:\n\nBuild Your Support Team\n\nLesson 10:\n\nIntegrate Your Life\n\nLesson 11:\n\nLead With Purpose\n\nLesson 12:\n\nEmpower Others to Lead\n\nLesson 13:\n\nFinal Class\n\nReadings\n\nBrown, Brene. Daring Greatly: How the Courage to be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead. New York: Gotham, 2012.\n\nCraig, N., George, B.; & Snook, S. The Discover Your True North Fieldbook. New Jersey: Wiley, 2015.\n\nStone, D., Patton, B. and Heen, S. Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most. New York: Penguin Books, 2010.\n\nStudents receive three texts. The first of them, The Discover Your True North Fieldbook, is the basic text for ALD. Assignments in this workbook are designed to personalize and deepen your understanding of each week’s topic. Students are expected to complete all assigned exercises in this workbook prior to attending class each week.\n\nSelected chapters will be assigned from the books, Difficult Conversations and Daring Greatly.\n\nLeader Development Groups (LDGs)\n\nPrior to our second meeting, each student will be assigned to a six-person Leader Development Group (LDG). LDGs meet in designated classrooms from 5:30 – 7:30 pm each week on the same day as your class. LDG meetings are a central part of the course and as such are treated just like normal class time. Attendance is mandatory. Do not take ALD if you cannot commit to attending all 12 LDG sessions (there is no LDG meeting following Lesson 1).\n\nThe purpose of LDGs is to carve out an intimate and safe place to engage in a deeper discussion of that day’s topic with your peers. Each week, a different student will be assigned to facilitate that day’s session. Faculty will provide additional guidance in the form of suggested exercises and discussion questions to help facilitators prepare for and lead their groups.\n\nEach student will have the opportunity to facilitate for two weeks during the course. Facilitators will meet briefly with their professor prior to the LDG to discuss that week’s meeting (typically just following each day’s class). An ALD “Facilitator’s Guide” will be posted on the course website and also sent out to you via email when it is your turn to facilitate. The Facilitator’s Guide will provide a helpful overview of your responsibilities as facilitator for the weeks that you are assigned to that role.\n\nFollowing each LDG meeting, facilitators will submit a summary of the group’s discussion, including attendance records and open questions.\n\nCopyright © 2023 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

He is currently a board member of US Foods and multiple privately-owned restaurant groups.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nUniquely within the HBS EC curriculum, this course is industry specific. Despite its pervasiveness and intimate consumer interaction, the restaurant industry has been lightly studied academically. And yet its entrepreneurial and management learnings have broad application beyond restaurants. Sited within General Management, this course explores exactly that.\n\nWe will run the gamut from planning for the first restaurant to scaling to leadership of multinational chains, and evaluate opportunities inherent in typical restaurant business models as well as those created by disruptive changes affecting and shaping the industry.\n\nMichael and Andy will co-teach the course using written cases, as well as “live” cases with protagonists facing real-time challenges. We will draw on industry executives, HBS alumni active in the industry, industry analysts and investors, and well-known chefs and restaurateurs.\n\nBackground. 9 in 10 consumers say they enjoy going to restaurants and half of consumers consider restaurants to be an essential part of their lifestyle. Restaurants are an important source of employment: the industry is the 2nd largest private employer in the US, employing over 15 million people in 2023, with over 60% of adults and 70% of millennials in the US having worked in the restaurant industry at some point in their life and 1 in 3 Americans having their first job experience in a restaurant. Restaurants have provided significant management and ownership opportunities for women and minorities.\n\nRestaurants are also big business. In 2023, US restaurant industry sales approached $1 trillion representing a $3 trillion economic impact and approximately 4% of the US gross domestic product. While scaled restaurant operations are frequently featured, interestingly approximately 70% of restaurants are single unit operations. Restaurants have also attracted significant interest from venture capital and private equity and the industry has spawned a number of “unicorns.”\n\nWe hope to engage not only with students interested in the restaurant industry, but also those interested in food and sustainability, applications of technology and, given the labor-intense characteristic of restaurants, the complex interaction of food and labor costs with consumer value. The course may also appeal to future consultants, investment bankers and venture capital/private equity professionals, as well as to students interested in general management, particularly regarding an industry subject to hugely disruptive forces and spawning compelling investment opportunities.\n\nCourse Content\n\nRestaurant Economics. We will do a deep dive into the levers of financial management of restaurants – examining both revenue and cost strategies.\n\nGrowth and Scale. This module will examine the factors that have traditionally determined profitability and valuation. It will consider growth potential and exit strategies for successful restaurants and emerging chains, including the advantages and disadvantages of franchising, institutional investment and leverage. We will consider the challenge of scale – how to achieve it and how to manage it once achieved. In addition, how founders consider a partial or complete exit and the criteria they established for a possible sale, as well as how the markets evaluate a public restaurant company and the factors that drive valuation.\n\nMenu Management. Chefs and restaurateurs often say they offer what their guests want to eat but many are also interested in the healthiness and sustainability of their offerings. We will examine whether and how chefs lead or follow trends, how they distinguish trends from fads, what drives their selection of menu items, how they manage their supply chain and whether post-pandemic, consumers are likely to change their food preferences.\n\nCrisis Management. Covid-19 was an existential crisis for restaurants – we’ll examine responses, both successful and not so. We will also consider the critical issue of food safety and the crisis management implications when a foodborne illness strikes.\n\nFranchising. How does it work? When does it make sense from both investment and brand perspectives? Recent HBS alums have pursued franchising of quick-service restaurant brands – we’ll study both the challenges and opportunities they encountered. We’ll also view franchising from the franchisor perspective, including when a franchised brand goes off the rails.\n\nDisruption/Technology. We will examine the increasing challenges – and in light of the pandemic, the increasing necessity -- restaurants face in assessing, adopting, affording and maximizing the utility of technological changes such as mobile ordering, delivery and advanced loyalty programs. We’ll also consider the rapid growth of “ghost kitchens” and how restaurateurs are developing asset light models providing consumers with increasing choices among brick-and-mortar restaurants and delivered meals.\n\nCompensation and Workforce Management. The execution of restaurant/dining experiences requires a focus on both hospitality and profitability – how can cultures be developed to deliver both consistently? Among the most significant challenges facing the industry are the decreasing availability, increasing cost, and high turnover in the labor force. We will examine the responses of the industry to these issues, especially in light of increasing concerns about how to bridge the gap between consumer willingness to pay/perception of value and the hurdles restaurants face in trying to pay living wages.\n\nTwo classes will be devoted to exercises that students will prepare and submit in advance of and debrief in class before industry experts who will participate in the class. These exercises will be graded.\n\nGrading will be based on class participation (40%), the two exercises (30%), and a final exam (30%). Cross registrants will be accepted.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

Usually these sessions are from 5:30-7:30pm, but there will be two Wednesday sessions that will be longer – 5:30-8:30pm – to accommodate special opportunities. The exact dates will be announced before the semester begins.\n\nEducational Objectives\n\nCrafting Your Life: The First 10 Years Post MBA (LIFE) is fundamentally a course about you. It is about preparing and equipping you to better handle the choices, tradeoffs, and surprises that you will inevitably face after graduating from HBS. Throughout the course, you will define what a life well-lived means to you, and discover and implement tactics and practices to enable you to live consistently with what matters most to you. In addition, you will consider how to adapt along the way when life inevitably does not go according to plan.\n\nA unique feature of the course is the emphasis on community – with your fellow students as well as alumni. You will have access to alumni and their lived experiences. There are a multitude of interactions with both alumni 10+ years out reflecting on their lives to date as well as the over 300 former students of the course (known as LIFERs) who continue to be involved and share their current experiences. Alumni and LIFERs interact with students as part of the class in more traditional ways as case protagonists, and panelists, but also as part of small group discussions and one-on-one conversations. These interactions are meant to help inform you about others’ experiences and what they learned from them – and in turn to help you think more deeply about what you want out of your life and how you want to best equip yourself for what lies ahead.\n\nThe course strives to help you think deeply and intentionally about the following questions:\n\nDefining Your Compass\n\nWhat are my values? Who am I at my best?\n\nHow has my past shaped me? What assumptions do I have about my life – which do I want to keep and which do I want to revise?\n\nWhat does it mean to me to live a good life? What is important to me, and how will I prioritize my time and energy towards what matters most?\n\nOwning Your Actions\n\nHow do I approach decisions and tradeoffs across different areas of my life?\n\nHow do I use my time on a daily and weekly basis? How do I create and change habits that enable me to continue making progress towards the life that I want?\n\nHow do I think about my choice of geography?\n\nHow do I create structures for navigating life, with all of its twists and turns, with a life partner?\n\nHow do I think about career/family choices? What does it mean to be part of a dual-career couple? Would I ever consider opting out of the work force?\n\nEquipping Yourself for What You Cannot Control\n\nHow do I take care of myself, and especially take care of my mental health? How do I build my capacity for resilience?\n\nHow do I develop relationships that will sustain me – both at work and in life?\n\nHow do I think about making a “difference” in the world? In what ways can I craft my life and my job in ways that will enable me to achieve my goals?\n\nWith this in mind, LIFE is not your typical HBS class. When you sign up for LIFE, you sign up for:\n\nA Laboratory. We think of life as a laboratory, and crafting your life as an ongoing discovery process of experimenting, learning, and adapting over time. Similarly, the LIFE course is not and never will be a finished product. The first version of the course was developed in close partnership with EC students and we continue the process of co-creation with students every year—and expect you to play an active role in shaping the course for future generations. By getting comfortable with trying new and different ways of learning, providing feedback, and sharing ideas to improve the course, you will also practice a “test-and-learn” mindset and develop skills that you can apply in your own life laboratory.\n\nA Community for Life-Long Learning. When you join LIFE, you are joining a broader community of students and alumni invested in learning with and supporting each other in the pursuit of a life well-lived. Throughout the course, we will build shared language, skills, and norms about what it means to craft your life, thereby enabling you to engage with one another deeply on personal topics that might otherwise be undiscussed in an academic or professional setting. LIFERs (graduates of the course) will interact with you throughout the semester, and in the final class they will welcome you into the LIFER community.\n\nIntergenerational Learning. HBS has a tremendously broad and diverse alumni network with a wide array of professional and personal experiences. LIFE is a platform to unlock the potential of the alumni network by facilitating intergenerational learning. Throughout the course, you will engage with alumni in a variety of ways, including: one-on-one interviews, panel discussions on specific topics, and two unique events—a reception featuring small group conversations between students and alumni and a celebration at the end of the semester where LIFERs will welcome you into the LIFER community.\n\nTwo important notes to consider, before signing up for LIFE:\n\n1. LIFE involves a lot of work. LIFE students should be deeply invested in learning about themselves, in supporting others, and in partnering with Professor Perlow and the LIFE Team to innovate on the course and the broader LIFE initiative. Former students have commented on the intense workload!\n\n2. The alumni vignettes that you will read/hear in LIFE are meant to share with you diverse examples of HBS alums who have made different choices, in different areas of their lives, for many different reasons, and have drawn many different life lessons from those choices. When you read/hear these materials, and when we discuss them in class, the goal is for you to learn from their experiences and think about what their experiences teach you about you. We’re not interested in judging them or assessing whether they are living a life well lived. It’s your job to figure out what it means for you to live a life well lived by engaging with these materials and conversations.\n\nCourse Structure and Requirements\n\nLIFE has two sections of 40 students each. This class size is designed to foster deep connections through class discussion, small group conversations, and pair-and-shares.\n\nTime\n\nLIFE has a unique class structure designed to create the best possible learning environment for each topic and experience. Each section meets separately on Tuesdays during a regular X schedule block, and both sections will come together on Wednesday nights from 5:30-7:30 pm except on two Wednesday nights it will meet from 5:30-8:30pm (dates will be announced before the semester begins) to enable special opportunities. These evening sessions are classes, and you are required to attend all of them.\n\nAssignments During Semester\n\nWeekly Readings. Each week you will read cases and/or vignettes about alumni as you do in a traditional HBS class. However, the intent of these cases/vignettes is to help you understand what the person being described did, and for you to reflect on your own reactions and what you would do – not to judge what they did.\n\nWeekly Exercises. Most weeks you will have exercises that accompany the readings to learn more about you, whether it’s looking back at your past, or tracking how you spend your time, or playing a life simulation to uncover the choices and tradeoffs you are inclined to make. The exercises will include LIFE Reflection & Activity workbook exercises and other online exercises.\n\nModule Reflections. At the end of each of the three modules of the course you are asked to stop and reflect on what you have been learning about yourself. These reflections are required to be done on time, but are not graded, and rather are built in for you to pause and explore your insights. They will form the basis of your final paper so the more you invest during the semester the easier your task come the end of the term.\n\nInterviews. Throughout the semester you are required to conduct 4 interviews. The first interview is with a former Crafting your Life student (LIFER) and the remaining 3 are with alumni five or more years out of HBS. You can choose your own alumni or use the LIFE Connect tool developed for this course to match you with alumni that are prepared to talk about the topics you are hoping to discuss. The LIFE Interview Guide and Notebook is where you will capture your preparation and interview notes before formally writing up your learnings as part of the final paper. You will submit your LIFE Interview Guide and Notebook as part of the final course submissions.\n\nFinal Paper\n\nYour final paper is an opportunity to compile all that you have done throughout the semester. Essentially, you will be “writing” your final paper throughout the semester through the weekly exercises, module reflections, and alumni interview summaries. The purpose of the paper is to meaningfully reflect on all that you’ve learned about yourself, and to create something to which you can refer back throughout your life. The final paper integrates what you have learned, and you will also involve the creations of an artifact as a tangible companion piece to the paper to remind you in your daily life of what you have learned about yourself and wish to stay true to going forward.\n\nDesign Partners\n\nLIFE is unique in that it is an EC course created by EC students, for EC students. The course originated in 2019 through a partnership between EC students and HBS alumni and continues to evolve (in both form and content) in collaboration with our students – who we consider to be our design partners. If you sign up for LIFE, you are not just electing to take a course—you are choosing to pick up the baton from those students who came before you, and continue the course development process with all the attendant joys of leaving a legacy that will be part of HBS students’ experience for years to come. Note, however, that this also requires the full awareness that some aspects of LIFE are in the process of being designed, in partnership with you. Your ongoing feedback and help will be part of the experience, and part of the learning that you (and we) take away from the course.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

Every operating model and business plan ‘assumes’ a certain amount of sales, but that assumption is the tipping point. Without sales, the entire model is an exercise in frustration and futility.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to demystify sales and help you understand how to sell products and services within entrepreneurial settings. The course material is applicable whether you become an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, management consultant, general manager, product manager, salesperson, or sales manager. The course is geared toward entrepreneurial settings, specifically execution required by the founder. However, the best practices are applicable to larger company requirements as well.\n\n“The #1 skill HBS alums wish they had spent more time understanding at school was how to sell.”\n\n-Dean Nohria\n\nEntrepreneurs and general managers must not only understand the sales process but also embrace that the ability to sell is the single most critical success factor of any new enterprise. This course does not approach sales from the vaunted perspective of ‘strategy’. It gets right into the very practical and tactical ins and outs of how to sell as a founder. In a larger sense, the entrepreneur and general manager must “sell” his or her vision to prospective employees, to angel and venture investors, and to strategic partners. While all true and all necessary, this course focuses mainly on selling to customers, whether that is through a direct sales force, a channel sales force, or building an OEM relationship. Sales is the one function that cannot hide behind the veil of corporate doubletalk; sales goals are either made or not made. Every organizational activity leverages off that single fact. Markets are not totally rational organizations and the firms with the best sales teams will usually win.\n\n“Superior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product differentiation. The converse is not true. No matter how strong your product, even if it easily fits into already established habits and anybody who tries it likes it immediately, you must still support it with a strong distribution plan.”\n\n-From “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel\n\nOne common misconception is that product innovation alone is a winning tactic. It is not. Often the critical success factor is exactly how a firm goes to market – with its sales force. But the rules have changed – innovations like ‘product-led-growth’ models and social media are changing the status quo and forcing managers to consider new way to structure and incent sales teams.\n\nCLASS REQUIREMENTS\n\nPreparation and class participation are a requirement. We will cold call students to open each class. Every class is associated with a short assignment, and all students are required to be ready to discuss the assigned material.\n\nSales is a highly experiential, hands on skill that requires role playing and iterative practice to master. As such, Founder Selling uses a more experiential pedagogy during the semester. Unlike most courses at HBS, there is no final exam or final project. Instead, we will run seven experiential assignments, largely executed outside of the classroom, in parallel with the classroom sessions. You will learn how to book appointments, run the first sales meeting, demonstrate your product and service, close large complex deals, and run renewal and expansion calls. In addition to the course faculty, students will be assigned to a sales coach who will review assignment submissions with the course faculty and be available for one-on-one coaching after each assignment.\n\nClass sessions will be 80 minutes long and will be largely be executed in three parts: a cold call opening in which a student presents his/her course of action as outlined in the case, class discussion of the case, and a presentation by the professor to emphasize the key leanings from the case. More than one unexcused absence will affect your final grade.\n\nCopyright © 2023 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

Doing so while on campus has several advantages, including access to resources (faculty time and attention, library and computer access); advice from your peers in a structured environment; and devoted blocks of time during your EC year to move your business forward while your team is all in one location. The course employs a combination of field methods, classroom exercises, cross-team interactions, and access to faculty, guest experts, and other advisors. The largest single allocation of time is for working with your team to make meaningful progress on your own business.\n\n\"Joiner\" students who are interested in taking the class by joining a business with one or more existing members are strongly encouraged to do so. We will create opportunities for businesses with one or more members to meet and combine with joiners.\n\nStudents can expect to:\n\nSummarize and critique their existing business, its strengths and weaknesses, and set priorities for moving the business forward, including the most pressing priorities to be addressed during the course itself.\n\nDevelop a strategy for taking the business to the next level, including a plan for funding, and a plan and timeline for reaching scale.\n\nGive and receive feedback from other highly motivated student teams.\n\nMeet frequently as a team with the faculty advisor.\n\nReceive feedback and counsel from outside business advisors.\n\nHave opportunities to pitch your work to angel, seed, and venture capital investors.\n\nThis course can be thought of as occupying a space between an IP and a traditional course, giving you an opportunity to work on something of great interest to you, while preserving many of the benefits of a larger course, including opportunities for guest speakers, feedback from your peers, and clearly delineated deliverables and milestones that act as commitment devices to push the business forward.\n\nIn the past the School has provided each Field X team with a modest grant of around $2,000 to help launch their business. While we cannot guarantee the grant program will continue this year, we hope and expect that it will.\n\nA substantial number of Field X businesses have been funded by mentors and investors they met through the course. Several dozen teams from last year are running their businesses full-time now, most of whom have received funding of $500,000 or more; in some cases far more.\n\nIn terms of requirements, \"in between an IP and a course\" means that there will be almost-weekly class meetings, but there will not, in general, be substantial weekly homework or required preparation for class, other than that you work to push your business forward.\n\nWho Should Enroll?\n\nStudents who are sufficiently excited about a business they are running, or a business they want to start immediately, that they want to focus on it in a serious way. Some, because they treasure the lessons they are learning from building a business. Some, because they think their business has a legitimate opportunity to grow rapidly and create a successful career path for them. And some because they believe their business can do a substantial amount of good for the world and so they want to continue working on it during their EC year and perhaps after graduation.\n\nCourse Deliverables\n\nThe main deliverable will be the team’s final presentation and the supporting slide deck and report. There will also be intermediate deliverables building up to that point. In short, expect to produce a Word document and a Powerpoint deck with descriptions of your business at the beginning of the course and a (perhaps similar, perhaps very different) version at the end of the course.\n\nOn the final day of class, students who wish to will have the opportunity to present their businesses to an audience of angel, seed and venture investors at our Pitch Day event. At our most recent Pitch Day, the first run over Zoom, around 350 investors attended.\n\nShort FAQ:\n\nQ: Can I take Field X if I am the only person involved in my business?\n\nA: Yes, Field X welcomes teams of all sizes; including solo founders, multiple team members in the class, and teams with multiple members, only one of whom attends HBS and takes the course.\n\nQ: What are classes like?\n\nA: Most weeks the class consists of an hour-long interactive talk/discussion with a luminary, followed by an hour of \"mini office hours\" in which student teams pair up with mentors who can help their business. Past speakers have included venture capitalist Tim Draper, Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary, stellar entrepreneurs like Yvonne Hao of PillPack and Charles Curran of Armored Things, and many others with wisdom to share.\n\nQ: How will the course be different due to Covid-19?\n\nA: The course has now returned to meeting in person, with a Zoom option still provided for mentors who wish to visit remotely and students who may need to be physically absent. \"Mini office hours\" with mentors are still offered via Zoom - students post their person Zoom links on the course Google Sheet for the mentors to join.\n\nMeetings with the Professor and TA can still be in person if students wish, or they can be by Zoom for students who prefer that.\n\nQ: Can I take the class if I just have an idea but I haven't started yet?\n\nA: Yes, this is typically the situation of between a quarter and a half of the teams in the course.\n\nQ: What if I don't even have an idea yet?\n\nA: If you want to start a business but don't have an idea, we'd welcome you as a \"joiner\" in Field X -- we will match you up with a team that is doing something you find exciting and that is looking to add talent. If you want to start your own business and have a nascent idea, we can work with you to build it into something real.\n\nQ: How about the other side of the coin, what if it's an old family business I'll be taking over, something like that?\n\nA: Yes, that's also fine.\n\nQ: Is Field X aimed at any particular sector, like tech?\n\nA: No, Field X teams run the gamut, every year we have consumer, healthcare, finance, real estate, tech, arts and entertainment, social enterprise, you name it.\n\nQ: What if my business has modest goals?\n\nA: That's fine, in Field X we're happy to work with teams that want to serve a small need as well as teams with enormous ambition.\n\nQ: If I take Field X, can I take Field Y? Do I have to take Field Y too?\n\nA: You can take just X, just Y, or X and Y.\n\nCross Registration\n\nCross-registrants are welcome to take the course.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCourse Description\n\nAlmost all human endeavors start with a Founder—a person who is willing to challenge the status quo, question prevailing wisdom on what is possible, and change our world. Founders notice problems and can see a potential solution that improves the lives of those around them. It’s an extraordinarily attractive proposition to so many, yet so few people are successful in accomplishing this goal.\n\nA founder needs to make difficult decisions in the face of great uncertainty and massively imperfect information. How does one, often with relatively little experience, develop and exercise the judgement to make these decisions? This course will lead a discussion around The Founder Mindset and the characteristics that enables one to build businesses of significance and make a meaningful difference in the world.\n\nWhy Learn About The Founder Mindset?\n\nThe course examines the choices all founders make when starting and building a venture, and provides helpful frameworks and practical tips and tools for building, scaling, and eventually exiting the business. How do you assemble, motivate and lead a team when you have big ambitions, limited resources, and a compass instead of a map? The course will walk you through practical actions, such as selecting a team, choosing a business model, and what to consider when choosing a co-founder and writing a founders’ agreement. You’ll learn tactics for dealing with difficult situations, like firing an employee, pivoting your business model, or selling/closing the business. The course supplements case studies and discussions with simulations and role-plays, where you will be faced with challenging situations and forced to make difficult decisions. You will gain a sense of the intense pressures, difficult decisions, and extremes—highs and lows—that every founder confronts in some way.\n\nWe analyze certain pivotal choices made by over 20 founders who set out to change the world in small and big ways. We meet a Lebanese young woman who spent 10 years making the perfect swimming goggle, and we look at the journeys of people who want to save human civilization by moving to Mars or reversing climate change. We see the strange twists of fate that resulted in iconic companies like Tinder, Tesla, and Pandora. We will try to tease apart the business model and financing choices that contributed to the outcome. In most cases, the pivotal choices these founders made have their roots in “people decisions.” Yet most founders (and VCs) pay less attention to the \"people\" choices that are critical to success.\n\nIn this course, you will think about: How should teams be structured? How can a founder see his or her own blind spots? Can you augment a founder’s weaknesses by hiring a complimentary team? When should a CEO be replaced?\n\nWe observe how both successes and failures have common antecedents. We look at the journeys of people who have succeeded because of the way they handled their failures. We will discuss the importance of exercising judgment and making consequential decisions, all with imperfect information and insufficient resources. We will also explore the power of commitment. Despite different outcomes, each founder has made a difference that others can build on. And, by pushing their intellectual and emotional limits, founders usually emerge stronger and more resilient. The Founder Mindset is a course about this human journey to make a difference in the world.\n\nWho Should Take This Course?\n\nThe course provides a strong conceptual foundation and practical tools for addressing common situations in entrepreneurship. In particular, this course should appeal to anyone interested in being a founder and creating something of significance. In addition, anyone interested in being involved with high-growth ventures, working with entrepreneurs as investors or advisors, working in entrepreneurial environments that are dynamic, complex and changing, or even just cultivating your own Founder Mindset can benefit from this course.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThe course is structured into five modules that represent roughly five critical decisions that together form The Founder Mindset: Idea Generation & Commitment, Founding Team, Raising Money, Difficult Decisions, and Equity Value Creation. Each module addresses specific issues—such as choosing co-founders, negotiating equity, hiring, firing, working with your board, and building your team—that occur primarily in that stage.\n\nIDEA GENERATION & COMMITMENT focuses on early critical decisions a founder makes regarding idea selection and commitment. It examines the stress of maintaining outward positivity in the face of constant adversity and uncertainty, and how important it is to display commitment.\n\nFOUNDING TEAM explores the importance of hiring right, building a strong team, and establishing trust in your co-founder relationship.\n\nRAISING MONEY widens the perspective to consider how a founder should approach raising financing and how the organization should be structured so that it can deliver a product or service reliably.\n\nDIFFICULT DECISIONS addresses many of the perennial questions of entrepreneurship: “Should I persist, pivot, or perish (close the business)”? “How do I fire employees?” What does it mean to “fail well?”\n\nEQUITY VALUE CREATION addresses the cases where founders are challenged with the growth of their firms and the requirement to deliver financially, answering questions like where should the CEO focus, what metrics matter, are your actions value accretive or destructive, do you grow or exit, and is all value-creation monetary?\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nClasses include case discussions, workshops, and team exercises that require your active participation. In addition to case discussions, you will be asked to deliver a pitch, conduct peer interviews, and reflect on your learning. There is no final exam, but instead a final project in which you will either deliver a comprehensive pitch or share how The Founder Mindset will help you achieve a greater impact.\n\nRequired Materials\n\nYou should come to class having already completed the assignment due for that day. That may entail reading cases or other required readings, watching videos, and/or participating in an activity.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

The course focuses on the opportunities and threats created by the flow of goods, services, and international capital across countries. International trade and capital flows can significantly affect the countries’ development efforts and provide clear investment opportunities for businesses. This course examines the determinants of competitiveness and economic development and challenges students to understand the role of micro and macro policies.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the world witnessed an explosion in trade and capital flows at the global level. This explosive growth, especially in emerging markets, has been fueled by changes in world politics (e.g., the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the shifting political climate in China, and political changes in Latin America and Asia) falling restrictions and advances in technology. The resulting ability to retain or outsource various subsets of production stages within firm and country boundaries fueled the fragmentation of production and the emergence of global value chains. A key driver of this phenomenon is the cross-border production, investment, and trade in final and intermediate goods led by Multinational Corporations (MNCs). Foreign direct investment (FDI) became the dominant source of foreign private capital for many emerging markets, promising additional productivity gains for recipient countries.\n\nGains from globalization and technology, more generally, can have different allocations and distributive effects. Indeed, rising inequality, the weak labor market performance for workers at the lower end of the skill spectrum, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, the COVID pandemic, wars, terrorist’ attacks, and security concerns have come together to foster growing concern against globalization in certain segments of the population in various countries. After decades of increasing global economic integration, the world faces the risk of fragmentation. The reevaluation of global value chains intertwines deeply with a broader backlash against globalization in numerous developed nations. Recent policies, including tariffs, trade restrictions, and domestic subsidies, have been justified as a way to reduce risks by reshoring and “friendshoring” supply chains. The cases in the module study how changes in the economic, social, and political environments can challenge previously institutional structures creating new opportunities and risks. More generally, gains from globalization and technology can have different allocations and distributive effects. The cases in the module study how changes in the economic, social, and political environments can challenge previously institutional structures, creating new opportunities and risks.\n\nThe course emphasizes both the economic consequences of policies and the political and institutional context in which they are established and implemented. The material thus bridges a gap between firm- and household-level behavior, which is typically well understood by a managerial audience, and aggregate phenomena, which are often less understood by this audience.\n\nCareer Focus: The course is intended for students who expect to have careers influenced by international trends.\n\nEducational Objectives\n\nThe course has been designed to give students an appreciation of the critical role of institutions and policies in affecting patterns of international trade, services, and capital flows and the government's abilities to manage them effectively. The course is tied together by two broad themes: (1) the determinants and effects of globalization and (2) policy-makers management of the effects of globalization. The cases approach these themes by exposing students to key recent events that have shaped how economists think about these subjects. The events covered have a clear global perspective as the cases are set worldwide.\n\nThe course also covers events from the last three decades, as they affect today’s business environment and reveal the cyclical nature of international capital flows.\n\nThe course pushes students to critically examine whether the main challenges for the future of globalization are institutional and political in nature or technology by studying the process of globalization in recent decades. The strategies of firms, the vitality of clusters, and the quality of the business environment in which competition occurs are important to determine a nation’s or region’s productivity. The course encourages students to consider fundamental characteristics of international trade and financial system: effects of trade, capital flows, why cycles in international capital flows recur, and how sovereign debt and domestic debt differ from each other in their contracts, explicit and implicit, and their enforcement.\n\nThe course also teaches students key insights from the field of international economics. First, economists have conventionally viewed trade policy preferences as being driven by whether openness to trade aligns with one’s economic self-interest, by concerns about the impact of trade on broader society, or by one’s socio-political identity. Second, trade in goods differs from trade in financial assets: a financial transaction inherently involves a commitment to pay at a later date. Financial transactions are, therefore, fundamentally affected by problems of asymmetric information and the risk that the contract will not be enforced, and both problems are exacerbated at the international level. Third, International financial flows are affected by two additional macroeconomic risks that are absent within countries: sovereign risk and the use of different currencies. International capital flows imply additional policy challenges for countries as policy-makers face a difficult trade-off among three objectives: monetary policy autonomy, and stable fixed makers face a difficult trade-off among three objectives: monetary policy autonomy, a stable fixed exchange rate, and free capital mobility. Research has demonstrated that local conditions- political objectives, financial markets, firms, and institutions for effective- decisively influence the operation of these basic macroeconomic logics in actual practice. As a whole, the course emphasizes the importance of domestic institutions for effective macroeconomic policy-making, capacious regulations, credible policy commitment, and attracting and using foreign direct investment efficiently.\n\nIn modern international competition, the roles of key stakeholders, including companies, governments, NGOs, and multilateral agencies, have shifted and expanded, and the traditional separation between them works against successful economic development. Additionally, the ability to mount and sustain a competitive strategy for a nation or region is a daunting challenge. The cases pay particular attention to the role of globalization, trade, and capital flows in shaping economic outcomes. The course will explore not only theory and policy but also the practical implications for all stakeholders.\n\nCourse Content and Organization\n\nGlobal Trade, Capital, and National Institutions focuses on the costs and benefits of international capital and the policies utilized to make it work. The course is composed of three intellectual segments.\n\nThe module Determinants and Effects of Globalization studies both potentially positive and negative effects in host economies of opening up. In particular, the cases analyze the effects of trade and capital flows in the development efforts of countries, with an emphasis on global value chains and FDI (which has become the main source of private flows to emerging markets) and the policies to attract and maximize FDI’s benefits. In addition, the cases in this first segment explore the effects of international capital flows in the context of financial crises.\n\nThe second segment of the course, Policies and Strategies for Harnessing the Benefits of Financial Globalization, focuses on strategies to harness the benefits of financial globalization and minimize potential risks. The cases cover policies regarding the management of trade using trade agreements and capital inflows using capital controls, the choice of exchange rate regimes, and policies associated with the management of sovereign defaults. The module ends with a discussion of the effects of transfers of capital and debt relief between rich and poor countries.\n\nThe last segment of the course, Global Challenges Ahead, studies the cases of the largest economies in the world. Because of their economic importance and political power, the policy options available to these countries and their effects are in many ways different from the standard “small open economy” cases analyzed in the course.\n\nAdministration\n\nGrading: based on class participation (50%) and a final (50%).\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

While it only has 5% of the population of the U.S., it is the second largest food exporter in the world, trailing only the U.S. It is recognized for its track record of innovation and productivity growth, increasing outputs while reducing inputs like pesticides. We will explore environmental sustainability aspects, innovations that can be extended to other global contexts, and examine some of the challenges currently facing the sector.\n\nThe materials sector includes things like cement and steelmaking, two large contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are trying to arrange visits to pilot projects in Belgium. We are also going to visit sites to examine ocean borne shipping, a hard to decarbonize sector.\n\nThis EC Field Course offering a unique educational experience, where students will get to observe and interact with business leaders engaged in decarbonization including renewable energy production and storage, and sustainable production of industrial and consumer goods.\n\nGroup presentations on core topics and visit site briefings will be required during the Fall to enable everyone to be well prepared for the visits, which allows students to fully focus on the visits during January. In January, we will ask for short daily reflections.\n\nEducational Objectives\n\nStudents will gain insight into the opportunities and challenges associated with designing, producing, distributing, and storing renewable energy, as well as developing and implementing sustainable production technologies in industries ranging from consumer goods to food and horticulture. We will visit firms and projects that have pioneered or are experimenting with sustainable technologies.\n\nCourse Content and Organization\n\nFall class sessions will be discussions—based on cases, readings, and student presentations—designed to establish a grounding in basic technologies. We may also engage with guests brought in remotely.\n\nThe January 2025 trip will includes visits to a wide range of unique sites that will illustrate the breadth of opportunities. This 3:10 video will give you a taste for 2024 visits. While we plan to visit some of the sites shown here, we plan to incorporate changes for 2025 as we explore new areas.\n\nPaper Preparation and Presentation\n\nStudents will be asked to work in small teams to prepare a presentation and paper on a topic related to our visits chosen from a list of options.\n\nCourse Credit and Fees\n\nStudents will receive 3 credits upon successful completion of this course.\n\nHBS will provide logistical support for the immersion (including accommodations, select meals, and local travel arrangements). Students will be charged a course fee towards defraying a portion of these costs. Students are responsible for booking and paying for their own round-trip air travel and any costs associated with required visa documentation and immunizations. Students should ensure adequate processing time for all visas, as travel fees are not refundable if a student does not secure visas on time.\n\nFor detailed information about what the course program fee includes and excludes, as well as information about student accommodations, please visit the GEO website or email geo@hbs.edu.\n\nGEO continuously evaluates the safety and logistical feasibility of running Immersive Field Courses in each location. Please be aware that IFCs can be canceled at any time due to changes in global health and safety or other unforeseen circumstances. Students will not be redistributed into another IFC, nor will a new course be developed. Course fees will be refunded.\n\nCopyright © 2024 President & Fellows of Harvard College.

The Africa IFC will highlight the many opportunities and potential challenges for students interested in business on the continent. Students will visit and work with companies in Ghana and gain firsthand experience of business in Africa, by meeting and working with other young Africans. We will reflect on a changing international environment marked by COVID, the decline of globalization, an oncoming global recession and a new Cold war ignited by the Ukrainian crisis. How are these factors affecting Africa, how are countries reacting to these challenges. How are these events impacting companies and how are companies reacting to these new difficulties. For students it will provide an opportunity to see and be part of problem solving and crisis management within an African corporate setting.\n\nOur sessions will begin with a look at the major political, economic and social trends that are dominating the continent. We will then examine the business environment and look at the peculiar features of business on the African continent as well as the impact of technology. How business is conducted in a continent where infrastructure is often poor, data absent, and capital constrained. Many of the lessons in this IFC are applicable to Global Emerging Markets, especially those in Asia and Latin America..\n\nWhile in Ghana and while on campus, students will have the unique opportunity of meeting with and learning from leaders in politics and business from across Africa. In Ghana there will also be opportunities to discover the social and cultural landscape of Africa, including the changing role of women in the society and how the issues of ethnic diversity and inclusion are tackled on the continent.\n\nI graduated from Harvard business school in 1980 and have worked on the continent for the last 42 years in both business and government. I hope to share with students the perspectives, network and experiences that I have gained over the decades. And with the network I have developed over those decades, I seek to place students within companies and projects where they can experience Africa first hand in both its difficulties and challenges, side by side its excitement and newness and its unique possibilities ...\n\nThe main deliverables will be:\n\na) report at the end of the time in Ghana to be submitted to the company.\n\nb) a piece of written work to done in Boston which looks at the main themes covered in the classes and in the readings\n\nCourse Credit and Fees\n\nStudents will receive 3 credits upon successful completion of this course.\n\nHBS will provide logistical support for the immersion (including accommodations, select meals, and local travel arrangements).

The stakes are high; emissions released by human activities are taking a catastrophic toll on the planet, prompting potentially an irreversible climate crisis. As a result, countries and companies have committed to decarbonization initiatives and announced net zero targets. While there are significant climate-related problems that are common across the world, there are some unique challenges and opportunities that are faced by developing economies. IFC India presents an opportunity for students to advance their knowledge of sustainability efforts, decarbonization and net zero in the context of a broader development agenda. The course will address and unpack the fundamentals of decarbonization, the science and impact of net zero, and the need and ways to build a sustainable future. Students will explore the balance of maintaining basic development goals, such as improving infrastructure, reducing poverty, energy access, housing, transport services, water, food security, education, and healthcare —while prioritizing decarbonization and net zero initiatives. This course will integrate learning across BGIE, finance, general management, technology, LCA, FGI and more!\n\nThis is a research-based course consisting of case and research-based learning in Boston and field research in India. Students will work in teams of 4, focused on a particular research work stream. Potential work streams include energy generation (renewables, cleaner fossil fuels, biomass, and green hydrogen), mobility, clean-tech, agriculture including dairy, urban resilience and adaptation, hard to abate sectors (steel, cement) ,carbon sequestering, waste management and real estate. Students will be able to select which research work stream they work on and form their own 4 person team. In Fall 2024, students will address the opportunities and challenges presented by these work streams during four class sessions. These sessions will include cases, guests, and collaborative student assignments. In January 2024, students will visit 10-12 organizations (including their operating facilities) in Mumbai and Bangalore . These organizations include private companies and government entities such as Tata Power, JSW Steel, Godrej Mangroves, Unilever, Mumbai Municipal Corporation, SELCO Foundation, Ather Mobility and startups such as Waycool, Pixxel Ohmium, and Log9. The schedule during the Immersion is expected to be intense with quite a bit of road travel so please be prepared for that.\n\nI have been doing business in India for over 30 years. This course will leverage my knowledge of the country and my network with business, government, non-profits, and development agencies to deliver a unique experience for students who not only what to learn more about climate related issues but also want to get a general understanding of doing business in India.\n\nThe final product is for each student team to produce a research paper on their work stream based on their research in Boston and the site visits in India.\n\nCourse Credit and Fees\n\nStudents will receive 3 credits upon successful completion of this course.\n\nHBS will provide logistical support for the immersion (including accommodations, select meals, and local travel arrangements).

Our objective is to provide students with perspectives and insight into the eighth largest economy in the world. Although it is dominated by SMEs (companies with annual revenues of below €50m make up 82% of the employed population, and account for 92% of the active companies in the national economy), Italy is the second largest manufacturer and the second largest European exporter. Students will learn how Italy’s companies – that include some iconic brands that leverage the powerful “Made in Italy” label - have found a way to compete in a global marketplace through innovation, design, openness to trade, quality, as well as internationalization, and strategic flexibility. Italy’s family capitalism has shown it can evolve and adjust to a changing world. Students will analyze how it has done so even against longstanding structural, macroeconomic, political, and governance issues that have slowed economic growth, especially since the GFC. Having suffered heavily from COVID-19 in part because of its large elderly population (Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in Europe), the country will be the largest recipient of funds from the novel €795bn Next Generation EU recovery package that will allow unprecedented investment in digitalization, the green economy, education, and health.\n\nRanked first in cultural heritage in most rankings and endowed with historical cities, world-renowned cuisine, and geographic beauty, it is one of the top three most visited countries in Europe year in year out, with tourism making up 13% of GDP. Amid such rich cultural heritage lay the foundations of the birth and development of modern capitalism to which Italy has made unique contributions. This course will give a unique and fascinating opportunity to understand and see these first-hand.\n\nCourse Content\n\nClassroom Sessions: The course will meet for six on-campus sessions during the fall semester, which will include case discussions and interactive lectures. The goals of the classroom sessions are to (1) provide an overview of the historical evolution and the present business, economic and political situation in Italy, (2) explore examples of how Italian companies innovate and compete, (3) gain an understanding of the structure of the Italian industrial landscape setting, (4) analyze the opportunities and issues of investing in the country and (5) understand the role of Italy in the birth of modern capitalism, including the history of double accounting, banking and its impact on trade and the arts. While on campus, we will visit Baker Library’s Medici Collection, comprising more than 150 ledgers and other manuscript volumes from the late 14th to the early 18th century that shed extraordinary light on the business and personal activities of six generations of one branch of Florence’s Medici family.\n\nImmersion in Italy in January: The immersion will take us to Turin, Parma, and Florence. We will be meeting with CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors, historians, economists, and HBS alumni for interactive sessions. We will tour selected companies, factories, museums, and retail outlets.\n\nDeliverables: Students will work in small teams to prepare a group presentation that examines one of the aspects of the course content to be delivered to the entire group at the conclusion of the program. Teams should expect to submit a written paper. Each student will submit a one-page reflection paper within one week after returning to campus. Students will be graded on attendance and participation, field work, peer feedback, and all deliverables.\n\n-Class participation, including on immersion, 50%\n\n-Paper (15-20 pages) or Project for a company 50%\n\nCourse Credit and Fees\n\nStudents will receive 3 credits upon successful completion of this course.\n\nHBS will provide logistical support for the immersion (including accommodations, select meals, and local travel arrangements).

This course will appeal to students who wish to acquire an understanding of alternative leadership styles and business models aimed at simultaneously creating economic and societal value. Through project work with a diverse range of business partners, from established corporations to burgeoning startups, students will have an opportunity to gain practical insights into Japan’s unique business ecosystem. This hands-on experience is invaluable for students aspiring to become leaders adept at navigating and leveraging diverse business landscapes for societal and economic benefit.\n\nEducational Objectives\n\nFrom cutting-edge robotics to technological art, from big data to nano-devices, Japan has become a hub for innovative projects that, despite their seemingly unconventional nature, have achieved considerable success. This course will expose students to a diverse range of pioneering organizations and business models, with the aim of achieving four learning objectives.\n\nFirstly, the course provides students with firsthand experiences and insights into the distinctive challenges and opportunities of conducting business and introducing innovation in Japan. Secondly, it demonstrates how innovation can emerge and diffuse by combining novel business models and marketing strategies. Thirdly, students will have the opportunity to learn from social entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs who have developed innovations with a social purpose. Finally, the course will expose students to Japanese culture and traditions, allowing them to gain a deeper appreciation of a unique society.\n\nCourse Content and Model\n\nOverview and Introduction: Students enrolled in the Immersive Field Course: Japan will work in small teams to undertake a project with an organization based in the Tokyo area. The course will meet for four on-campus sessions to (1) provide students with a basic understanding of the Japanese innovation ecosystem, (2) highlight some of the challenges and opportunities faced by businesses trying to bring innovation to market in Japan, including entrepreneurs and VCs, (3) discuss how some emerging business models and marketing strategies lend themselves to new forms of organizing, and (4) allow time for student teams to work together, engage with their project partners to define and scope the projects that will take place in January, and to prepare for travel.\n\nProjects: By the start of the course, project partners will have submitted a brief description of the business problem they would like students to address during the immersion. Before the second on-campus session, student teams will be formed. We will do our best to allocate students to their preferred project partners. In the period from October to December, student teams will engage in conversations and early work with project partners (scope the project, request/receive additional information, conduct telephone or Zoom interviews, develop early hypotheses, develop a work plan, etc.) in preparation for the field work that will take place in Japan. While in Japan, student teams will visit and work closely with their project partners in Tokyo. Students have the opportunity to assess the market/organizational environment by talking to customers, suppliers, government officials, and related organizations, as needed. Project teams will develop a set of recommendations before the last day of the immersion.\n\nDeliverables: Student teams will present their recommendations to the project partners. In addition, each student will present their personal take-aways at a Capstone event. Final grades will consider: (i) participation and attendance during the four class sessions in the Fall semester, as well as in Japan; (ii) engagement with project partners; (iii) on-site activities in Tokyo and Tohoku; (iv) feedback from partner organizations and peers on project work; and (v) a final report.\n\nTours: Students will have the opportunity to take part in company visits as well as various cultural activities in Tokyo and the Tohoku region throughout their stay in Japan. Students will come to appreciate unique business protocols practiced in Japanese companies - e.g., exchange of name cards, silence in elevators, empathy to co-workers, being on time, etc. - that contribute to Japan’s unique approach to entrepreneurship.\n\nAccommodations and Activities: Students will experience two different types of accommodations. In Tokyo, where the majority of overnights will take place, students will stay at a modern hotel in Central Tokyo. Students will take the bullet-train (Shinkansen) to the Tohoku region, where they will stay at a traditional Japanese ryokan. They will soak in hot spring baths (Onsen) and eat dinner wearing a yukata. Students will engage in volunteer work during their stay in Tohoku, as well as advise local social entrepreneurs and NPOs. Students will also have opportunities for other cultural activities in Tokyo, such as visiting live practice of sumo wrestlers.\n\nCourse Credit and Fees\n\nStudents will receive 3 credits upon successful completion of this course.\n\nHBS will provide logistical support for the immersion (including accommodations, select meals, and local travel arrangements). Students will be charged a course fee towards defraying a portion of these costs.
