        "text": "Michael C. Hall is an award-winning actor who forged a successful stage career in New York before starring in the series \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Dexter\". Hall has won several SAG awards and a Golden Globe, and has earned several Emmy nominations.\n\nHall landed the starring role in the HBO program \"Six Feet Under,\" an uncanny, unusual series that debuted in 2001, running for five seasons and earning many accolades for its writing and performances. Hall played David Fisher, an emotionally shut-down funeral home director who was conflicted about his sexuality. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his work on the show, and shared two Screen Actors Guild Awards with his co-stars in the ensemble drama category.\n\nDuring his \"Six Feet Under\" tenure, Hall made a return to the Broadway stage, portraying \"all I care about is love\" character Billy Flynn in the musical \"Chicago.\" He also starred in 2003's \"Paycheck,\" a film based on a story by Philip K. Dick that co-starred Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman.\n\nIn 2006, Hall continued his cable TV work with the Showtime series \"Dexter,\" based on the Doubleday novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, written by Jeff Lindsay. On the show, Hall portrays Dexter Morgan, a Miami police blood splatter expert who moonlights as a serial killer, applying a brand of warped vigilantism to other killers who've escaped from the law. Hall, who's won Golden Globe and SAG awards and received several Emmy nominations for the role, was also featured in the films \"Gamer,\" \"Peep World\" and \"The Trouble With Bliss,\" and has done ad voice over work for the car company Dodge.\n\nIn 2010, Hall was diagnosed with a form of Hodgkin's lymphoma, but was fortunate enough to have found the cancer at its early stages, making it a lot easier to treat and cure. Hall accepted his Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in 2010 while wearing a knitted cap over his bald head, having lost his hair due to chemotherapy. He is currently in remission."
