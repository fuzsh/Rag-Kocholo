        "text": "Nosaiba Lela\n\nAs a senior admissions ambassador, Nosaiba Lela combines her passion for creating an inclusive campus tour experience with her goal of addressing the challenges in seeking higher education. In her role, Lela put her passion into action, and campus tour procedures have been adapted to different cultural backgrounds, significantly improving the OU tour experience for all participants.\n\n“This includes everything from educating my white peers on various religions, ethnicities and the financial standings of those we bring to our campus. In doing so, I have opened their eyes to things that they were not aware of, thus adjusting the way we approach campus tours and group visits,” Lela says.\n\nAs a result, longer diversity training has been implemented in which ambassadors learn to consider perspectives they may not have been aware of.\n\nAdmissions Adviser Hannah Stanhope praises Lela’s gift to lead with compassion and her love for building community on campus. “Working in higher education, in any capacity, you learn that every single student is walking through a unique experience that can sometimes be overlooked…,” Stanhope says. “Nosaiba looked past the stereotypes and really learned what these students need and as a result has taught us what we as an office need to improve on.”\n\nDrew Huff, assistant director of Campus Visits, describes Lela as a leader on and off campus. When tasked with assigning a student to attend an off-campus panel discussion that brought local officials and community members together to discuss college access and educational equity, Huff immediately thought of Lela.\n\n“She was a wonderful speaker and an example to attendees of what bright students attend OU,” Huff says. “Not only did she represent on the stage, but she also had the chance to meet with Governor Whitmer to discuss barriers to higher education and how we can overcome them at the state level. Her future is bright and her passion for the success of others and justice for all people will make her a great leader in any space she inhabits.”\n\nGraduate Assistant Dina Abbas, who has supervised Lela in her role as Senior Admissions Ambassador, has witnessed the impact Lela has made at Oakland University, particularly in the realm of diversity, race relations and her dedication to improving the educational experience for all students.\n\n“As a Muslim Egyptian American, Nosaiba's journey has been marked by unique challenges and adversities,” Abbas says. “Nosaiba has openly shared that she is constantly navigating cultural nuances while bridging the gap between her heritage and her American identity. In the face of these challenges, Nosaiba has exemplified resilience, grace and commitment to advocating for inclusivity and diversity.”\n\nTayion Williams\n\nTayion Williams does not let any obstacles slow him down. Raised by his sister after the passing of his mother at a young age, Williams directed his own path by focusing his ideas and thought processes on success.\n\n“Losing my mother is something that I deal with every day, but will never be something I use as an excuse. The things I do are to make her proud,” Williams says. “Instead of using my pain as a cushion to slow down or stop, it was motivation to work even harder and push myself further, and I'd like to be even a fraction of the person she was.”\n\nStarting his educational journey at Oakland University felt like a lonely experience at first, especially when Williams noticed he was one of only a few Black students in one of his classes. However, after becoming a CORE Ambassador in the Center for Multicultural Initiatives, Williams found a supportive environment in which he interacts with students and provides them with the guidance he had always sought out. Besides being actively engaged in the CORE program, Williams has established himself as a leader on campus through his work in the classroom and as resident assistant, first year assistant and programs director for Student Video Productions.\n\n“Tayion has shown personal growth and responsibility through the first year assistant role… I have seen firsthand Tayion's commitment to his professional and personal development, his education and the campus community,” says Celeste Black, coordinator of Orientation and New Student Programs.\n\nAs a resident assistant, Williams strives to provide an inclusive community for all. “Tay has successfully managed to balance his intensive coursework with his staff and extracurricular responsibilities. Tay has been able to adapt to different conditions and has shown that he is resilient in many different environments,” says Pedro Marin, residence director at Oak View Hall. “His ability to make anyone in a room smile is incredible and his presence is always appreciated. His professional and personal approach to communication is admirable and valued in the work that he does for University Housing, and his coursework.”\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Film Studies and Production Brendan Kredell, Ph.D., describes Tayion as a leader inside and outside of the classroom. Kredell, who lobbies for the passage of a series of bills in Lansing that would reinstitute tax incentives for media production in Michigan and could create a more viable post-graduation future for film and media students, chose Williams to represent OU in the state capital to advocate for a transformative investment in the industry.\n\n“He is a natural leader amongst his peers, the kind of student who can command a room without being overbearing. Whether it be through his sense of humor, his exemplary work, or his general affability, he’s the kind of person that people want to work with, and to work for,” Kredell says.\n\nTuger Xiong\n\nA proud, first-generation Hmong American, Tuger Xiong (they, them) faces trials and tribulations head-on. After experiencing racial bullying, the musical theatre major co-founded, produced and assistant directed Kaleidoscope Cabaret, “a performance to highlight the hidden truths of students of color in the theatre department.”\n\n“I wanted to champion the voices of the global majority and showcase the intricacies of our lives,” Xiong says. “The first meeting organized was a unique experience. A room full of BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color] students with the instinctual feeling that we have all gone through similar journeys. There was a reason we all agreed to be there that day.”\n\nKaleidoscope Cabaret’s two sold-out performances were a smashing success and gave Xiong an opportunity to build an understanding of cultural diversity. One of the stories presented in the performance were Xiong’s relationship with their mother as a Hmong trans nonbinary child told through a rendition of “Reflection” from the Disney movie “Mulan,” translated into Hmong.\n\n“The event was so well-received, Tuger helped expand Kaleidoscope as co-founder into a full-fledged student organization. Tuger currently is secretary for the organization and is a well-sought student mentor for our first-year students in the Musical Theatre Department. I have seen Tuger’s confidence skyrocket in the little time we’ve known each other – with every performance, Tuger puts their all into their work, carefully crafting their approach to their stage character roles, all while maintaining an infectious smile and magnetic personality,” says Cat Dacpano, accompanist and vocal coach in the OU School of Music, Theatre and Dance.\n\nAssociate Professor of Theatre Lynnae Lehfeldt, who also serves as the faculty advisor to Kaleidoscope, describes Xiong as a serious student, class cheerleader and someone with wisdom beyond their years.\n\n”Tuger has approached their work at Oakland with maturity and joy. Joy might sound like an odd word to praise in a student; however, in performance classes it is desperately needed,” Lehfeldt says. “An instructor needs to quickly instill trust and a sense of ensemble for the students to achieve the most training. Tuger is a student who instructors rely on to be open, truthful, vulnerable – they model this for the other students.”\n\nXiong also serves as a board member on Infinity, a K-pop Dance Cover Team with a mission to showcase how music can bring cultures together.\n\n“Tuger’s heart, personality and confidence is larger than life and the way that they connect with others is inspiring to observe and experience,” says Assistant Professor of Theatre Kelli Crump. “I can state with confidence that they are a motivated and responsible person with a high degree of integrity. As such, I expect that they will be a beautifully positive representative and role model for our university on multiple levels.”\n\nAshamoye Mullings\n\nAshamoye “Asha” Mullings leads by example. From mentee to mentor, Mullings has impacted those around her in a powerful way. Starting her college journey at OU while the country was grieving the murder of George Floyd drove Mullings to become more involved on campus. “I believe in standing up for what is right, so when the Association of Black Students wanted to protest against racism, I jumped at the opportunity to assist,” Mullings says. “Attending the Black Lives Matter protest was an eye-opening experience. It showed me that change is possible if we work together.”\n\nDrawing from the impactful experience, Mullings became a night watch desk worker in Hamlin Hall where she created a welcoming environment and empowered freshmen through her support and guidance. Building on her dedication to community, Mullings also served as core ambassador in the Center for Multicultural Initiatives (CMI), where she mentored freshmen through one-on-one sessions, while providing support and making life-long connections.\n\nVaNessa Thompson, CORE program coordinator in the CMI, met Asha during the 2020-21 academic year when Mullings herself was a CORE student participating in the remote Summer Bridge program. Thompson says she first saw Mullings’ “determination shine through the screen,” then later making her mark by stepping up into leadership roles on campus.\n\n“Through her student leadership involvement, she stepped out of her comfort zone and became an active member in Intrigue (Hip Hop Dance Team), Association of Black Students (ABS) and Project Big Sister (PBS). Asha has continued to make amazing contributions to the OU community,” Thompson says.\n\nDetermined to use her education to make a difference in health care after graduation, Mullings also shines in the classroom and incorporates her passion into her work, leaving a lasting impression with her research project on the impact of breast cancer in the Black community, focusing on social determinants of health and the inequalities in receiving life-saving information and care.\n\n“Asha's approach was both creative and inclusive. She created an informative brochure that highlighted the signs, risks and local resources for breast cancer among women of color in Detroit,” Wellness and Health Promotion Assistant Professor Kathryn M. Rougeau, Ph.D., says. “What made her project stand out was its universal approach – it wasn't just for women but for everyone. She believed that educating about health is a collective effort and her aim was to have this brochure not only in clinics but also in everyday places like grocery stores, schools, churches, pharmacies, convenience stores and restaurants. Her vision was that more exposure would lead to better health education and fewer disparities.”\n\nSpecial Lecturer Charlie Rinehart has seen both Mullings’ passion for community and her drive to strengthen her academic skills. “Asha consistently came to class with a good attitude and a desire to improve herself as an academic,” Rinehart says. “She was prepared, organized and appeared interested in many different topics. She interacted well with her peers during class discussions and developed confidence as a Wellness and Health Promotions student.”\n\nShamiah Woods\n\nShamiah Woods describes her journey at Oakland University as a “path of self-discovery and a commitment to breaking down racial barriers.” Influenced by health issues and a challenging upbringing early on, Woods learned the value of endurance and the importance of developing healthy coping mechanisms for hardship — lessons she continuously incorporates into her work at OU.\n\nAt Oakland University, Woods found support and community in the Center for Multicultural Initiatives “Collectively Oakland Retains Everyone” (CMI CORE) program, and was determined to give back the support she had received herself to students from similar backgrounds.\n\n“As a CORE Ambassador, I mentor many first-generation students of color, sharing my own experiences and empowering them with essential skills such as networking, self-advocacy and seeking help when needed,” Woods says. “By fostering a sense of belonging among underrepresented students, I've actively contributed to improving interracial understanding on campus.”\n\nWoods’ sense of service does not stop there: From serving as Orientation Group Leader, First Year Assistant and Undergraduate Admissions Ambassador, she makes it her mission to leave a lasting, inclusive and positive impact on each person she encounters.\n\n“Shamiah is passionate about everything she is involved in and provides a contagious, positive energy whenever she is around. She is driven to maintain relationships, motivate others and advocate for change. Shamiah is a hard worker and strives to meet each of her goals,” says Celeste Black, coordinator of New Student Programs, who describes Woods as an active and academically driven student who leads by example.\n\nAs a human resources development major and Honors College member, Shamiah consistently includes lessons learned in her program into her work, such as supporting the creation of training by applying activities, campus presentations or resources, and coursework to create a more inclusive work environment.\n\nShaun Moore, Ph.D., director of e-Learning, immediately noticed Shamiah’s dedication to her education in the Honors College. “From the first day I met Shamiah, I saw in her indicators that put her in the forefront of my students,” Moore says. “It quickly became clear in class that I could give her a task with just a few details and count on her to carry it out with the utmost professionalism. Her reliability, patience, attention to detail and overall work ethic are unsurpassed by other students.”\n\nDrew Huff, assistant director of campus visits, says Woods plays a vital part in embodying and demonstrating the values and the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in her role as Admissions Ambassador. “Shamiah approached every day on our team with positivity, enthusiasm and empathy,” Huff says. “She is a natural leader who takes her role as a representative of Oakland University very seriously. She has great pride in her community and never shies from an opportunity to educate and assist others. She also is a staunch advocate for others and would often take any opportunity she could to advocate for her fellow ambassadors and their wellbeing and safety.”\n\nAJ Joseph\n\nGrowing up Indian American and gender non-conforming, AJ Joseph felt invisible. Early on, Joseph noticed a lack of representation in the media and also later when starting their college journey. “Oakland University is a white-majority institution, something I noticed as a person of color on campus. Being the minority in the new space, I wanted to blend in, making myself feel more invisible,” Joseph says. “Being gender non-conforming did not lessen my feelings of invisibility. Being transgender and South Asian can feel more isolating, as I do not fit the traditional Indian demographic as well as the stereotypical member of the LGBTQ+ community.”\n\nOn campus, Joseph began connecting with others in the Center for Multicultural Initiatives (CMI) and the Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC), which gave them the confidence to become a peer mentor for both, helping mentees navigate their college experience. In their role in the GSC, Joseph participates in events, such as Lavender Graduation and Queer Trans Person of Color discussion, challenging “the stereotype that Indians cannot be a part of the LGBTQ+ community,” they say. Joseph also serves as secretary of the Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA), making it their mission to add to the diversity of the alliance.\n\nBlake Ilan, coordinator of the OU Gender and Sexuality Center, describes Joseph’s strongest qualities as their ability and commitment to lead by example. “By choosing to be a leader in our community, AJ has taken on significant personal risk, and I commend their bravery immensely,” Ilan says. “They are focused on the greater good over themself, without ignoring their needs, and holding firm boundaries. They are a model student leader, and a profoundly important member of our OU LGBTQ+ community.”\n\nVaNessa Thompson, CMI CORE Program Coordinator, says when the CMI was looking for students who would be a great fit as student leaders, AJ’s name was one of the first to come up.\n\nThompson first met Joseph when they ran for secretary of the GSA. “I was thoroughly impressed with AJ’s poise during the election speech,” Thompson says. “I also appreciated that AJ spoke about connecting more students of color to the Gender and Sexuality Center and GSA. AJ unapologetically advocated for the intersection of those students, many of whom could not have been present during the election.”\n\nJoseph does not only shine as a leader on campus, they also stand out academically. Professor of Chemistry Ferman A. Chavez describes Joseph as one of the top students he has taught and mentored, consistently scoring at the top of the class and also excelling in the laboratory where Joseph quickly learned and “demonstrated diligence and patience and contributed to a positive atmosphere in the lab.”\n\nKayla Smith\n\nA keen knack for leadership and a deep dedication to community service play an integral role in Kayla Smith’s life. Inspired by former First Lady Michelle Obama, who said “There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish,” Smith empowers those around her by creating a sense of belonging and opportunity.\n\nDuring her time at Oakland University, Smith has made an impact in various leadership roles. She has created the Queen Collective (QC), an organization that aims to elevate Black, collegiate women through service, empowerment and womanhood.\n\n“During my first-year, there were not many inclusive organizations for Black women, therefore, I decided to start my own called the ‘Queen Collective’ (QC),” Smith says. “The QC was created for all Black identifying women to feel a part of a sisterhood and showcase their efforts when it comes to giving back to the community.”\n\nSmith also serves as a resident assistant, where she supports her peers in overcoming struggles they may face and by creating a comfortable environment while residents adjust to campus life.\n\nTo her academic adviser Ashley Finkley, Smith stands out as someone who invests in others. “What sets Kayla apart is her genuine passion for creating an inclusive environment. She goes beyond the surface level, continuously striving to learn and grow as a leader. Kayla has not only created opportunities for underrepresented voices but has also served as a mentor and advocate for others, inspiring a sense of belonging among their peers,” Finkley says.\n\nOff campus, Smith has served as a volunteer at the Capuchin Soup Kitchen for the past nine years. She also sings on the praise team at Grace Church International and helps plan their events and fundraisers.\n\nSmith has established herself as an academic standout as well. History Professor Rochelle E. Danquah says she immediately realized that Smith is a student heading for success. Smith’s outstanding history capstone project focused on Nannie Helen Burroughs, a civil rights activist for African American women. “...Kayla has the passion, spirit and dedication of Burroughs as a social activist and student leader at Oakland University. I am proud to know that she is a part of our student population and a student scholar and leader,” Danquah says.\n\nSmith’s creativity and talent also weaved into her other classes. “Some students are happy with just giving the minimum of what is required but Kayla will always put her full creative energy into it,” says Special Lecturer Timothy Gralewski. “Most of the time her assignments are the best in the class and I can use her work as examples of how to successfully complete each assignment. She also has a very strong work ethic.”\n\nLooking ahead, Smith aims to continue her journey of leadership and service. “In my next few years here at OU, my plan is to continue inspiring and encouraging my peers while making growth within myself,” she says."
