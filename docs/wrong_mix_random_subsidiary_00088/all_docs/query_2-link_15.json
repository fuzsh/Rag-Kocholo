        "text": "James Davis, Professor of English at Brooklyn College, has served as PSC President since his election in 2021. He holds elected leadership positions in the AFT, NYSUT, and the Municipal Labor Committee and chairs the PSC-CUNY Welfare Fund trustees. As the COVID-19 pandemic extended beyond year one, he led the PSC’s impact bargaining with the CUNY administration, including the struggle for a coherent vaccine policy and the rollover of unused travel funds. During his first term, the PSC revived its membership campaign and gained hundreds of new members after a pandemic-era decline. He has advocated consistently for preserving municipal retiree access to traditional Medicare and engaged PSC members in that fight. In collaboration with coalition partners in the CUNY Rising Alliance, the PSC brought new state funding into the University, including millions of dollars to hire full-time faculty, and prevented the worst of the Mayoral cuts to CUNY.\n\nAs President, he has used his platform to advocate for educational quality and accessibility, racial and economic justice, and professional respect and job security on our campuses. The union’s legislative and electoral efforts have been energized by PSC member participation during his first term. Working with the Executive Council, he coordinated an inclusive process for engaging members in every title to develop an ambitious bargaining agenda for the next contract and prepared the union’s negotiations committee for bargaining. The Campus Action Teams that animate the union’s contract campaign grew from the deliberate collaboration of Chapter Chairs and the Executive Council. He has attended chapter meetings at every senior and community college and remains committed to engaging union members as the fights continue for a just contract and a New Deal for CUNY. A devoted teacher and scholar, he has published widely on American literature and received Brooklyn College’s Excellence in Teaching Award.\n\nJennifer Gaboury is a Lecturer on an adjunct conversion line in the Department of Women and Gender Studies at Hunter College. She teaches courses related to politics, gender, and sexualities and is working on a book on bathrooms, sharing intimate public space, and forging stronger commitments to public institutions. She has served on the boards of CLAGS, the Alternatives to Marriage Project, and currently sits on the steering committee for NYC Opt Out. She previously worked at Human Rights Watch.\n\nJen has been involved with the PSC since 2003, where she organized with the Adjunct Project and joined the Legislative Committee. She recently served as Hunter College’s Chapter Chair and as the Interim VP for Senior Colleges, in addition to serving on the Executive Council, Legislative Committee, and our Bargaining Committee.\n\nAs someone serving on a union-won adjunct conversion line, Jen is deeply committed to winning more dedicated adjunct conversion lines and expanding our “Hire From Within” campaign. She has long been involved with the CUNY Rising Alliance and looks forward to building a strong advocacy community among our largest constituency: CUNY alumni! Jen helped develop our “district captain” program, where members serve as the conduit between our elected reps and members in their city, state, and/or federal election districts; and she looks forward to growing this network. She’s been deeply involved with our state funding efforts tied to a New Deal for CUNY and is a champion of making CUNY tuition-free (again!) for in-state undergrads.\n\nFelicia Wharton has served as Treasurer of the PSC since her election in 2021 and is a Doctoral Lecturer at the Brooklyn Educational Opportunity Center (BEOC), administered by the New York City College of Technology. In her years as Treasurer, she has demonstrated a commitment to accurately accounting for all union funds, coordinating budget development, ensuring compliance, and safeguarding the union’s assets. Felicia is a PSC-CUNY Welfare Fund Trustee, NYSUT Board member, AFT Civil Human Rights Committee member, and PSC Teacher Education Representative. To address issues in teacher education, Felicia, working with David Gerwin of Queens College, established the PSC Teacher Education Working Group (TEWG) to unify, support, and develop a solid teacher-educator network across CUNY. Members of TEWG have provided input in state-level discussions and comment periods, such as edTPA, and have been appointed to NYSUT committees to address various issues in education. Felicia has a long record of advocacy for the Educational Opportunity Centers (EOCs), highlighting issues faculty and staff face daily, and continues to improve the working conditions for this group of PSC members. Felicia is a CUNY graduate with a PhD in Urban Education from the Graduate Center, a Master’s in Pure Mathematics from Hunter College, and, recently, a Master’s in Higher Education Administration from Baruch College.\n\nAndrea Vásquez previously served as the PSC First Vice President from 2021-2024. A Brooklyn native, Andrea attended NYC public schools and earned her BA from Hunter College. She is Associate Director at the Graduate Center’s American Social History Project/Center for Media and Learning and has been active in the PSC since 2000, when she moved from an RF line into the HEO series. Before becoming First VP, she was a Delegate, then HEO Chapter Chair where she focused on building new leadership and on contract enforcement, after the PSC won the HEO Salary Differential and improvements to reclassification. As Secretary, Andrea will continue to focus on a New Deal for CUNY, increasing membership and engaging in coalition work with other unions and organizations, including the CUNY Rising Alliance.\n\nDriven by her passion to win a just contract for all, as we also fight for the quality education our students deserve, Andrea has served on the contract negotiations team since 2010. She understands the significance of the major structural and economic advances that the PSC has won for and with members, and she is committed to securing a contract that strengthens and improves upon those victories. Andrea has spent years fighting for the best possible budgets for funding CUNY and the best possible contracts for members. Facing management at the bargaining table, building alliances with Albany legislators, speaking at PSC events and meetings, demonstrating in the streets of our city, engaging in civil disobedience, and conducting surveys are all components of our campaigns. She looks forward to continuing this work for #APeoplesCUNY, alongside PSC members."
