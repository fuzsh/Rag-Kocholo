        "text": "I was recently on the phone discussing the 2022 NBA Draft, and I was asked who I expected the Charlotte Hornets to select on June 23.\n\nIt didn’t take me more than a second to answer: Duke’s Mark Williams. That is who I have for the Hornets in my latest mock draft, and it’s not just simply because he fills a need in the frontcourt. Williams is an excellent player who was outstanding during March Madness.\n\nThe person who I was speaking with on the phone, however, was not at all convinced. The individual, who will remain anonymous but is incredibly well-connected around the league, brought up a point I had not considered.\n\nIs there any chance Michael Jordan, the majority owner of the Hornets and the most notable alumni from the University of North Carolina, uses a high first-round pick on someone from his rival Blue Devils?\n\nAfter the conversation, I couldn’t stop thinking about the question. As I was obsessing over it, I began my research to find out if MJ — who is famously petty and takes things personally — has any history of drafting players from his collegiate rival.\n\nIf he doesn’t, I was also curious: Who was left on the board over Jordan’s pettiness? Was this decision-making process ever costly or detrimental to his franchise? What does that mean for Mark Williams — or Duke’s AJ Griffin — on draft night?"
