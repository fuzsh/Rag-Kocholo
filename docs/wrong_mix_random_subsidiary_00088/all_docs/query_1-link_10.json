        "text": "Mike Brown, GW's third all-time leading scorer (1,916 points) and rebounder (1,166), played eleven seasons in the NBA as a member of the Chicago Bulls, Utah Jazz, Minnesota Timberwolves, Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns. A third round draft choice by the Bulls in 1985, he elected to play in Italy during '85-86.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Brown led the Colonials in scoring and rebounding for four straight seasons ('81-85) and paced the team in both field goal percentage and blocked shots three times. The East Orange, N.J., native made an immediate impact on the Buff and Blue, earning the Atlantic 10 Conference Rookie of the Year award in 1982. He also participated in the 1984 U.S. Olympic team men's basketball trials at Indiana University where he was one of 32 finalists.\n\nBrown finished his decorated collegiate career as one of just three GW players with 1,000-plus points and rebounds in his career (Joe Holup, Gene Guarilia). Over the course of 111 games, he averaged 17.3 points and 10.5 rebounds while amassing 64 double-doubles, earning either First Team or Second Team All-Atlantic 10 honors all four seasons as well as being named an Associated Press Honorable Mention All-American in 1984. He was recognized as an A-10 Legend during the 2015 conference championship in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nBrown, who earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Columbian College in 1985, is married to the former Esther Rodriguez and has two children, Xavier and Chanel. The Browns currently reside in Las Vegas, NV."
