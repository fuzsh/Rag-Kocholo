        "text": "What is Michael C. Hall's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nMichael C. Hall is an American actor who has a net worth of $25 million. Michael C. Hall first gained widespread recognition for his portrayal of David Fisher in the HBO drama \"Six Feet Under\" (2001-2005), for which he received an Emmy nomination. However, his most notable role came as the title character in the Showtime series \"Dexter\" (2006-2013), where he played a forensic technician and vigilante serial killer. His performance earned him critical acclaim and several awards, including a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Hall reprised his role as Dexter Morgan in the revival series \"Dexter: New Blood\" (2021-2022)\n\nHall has also appeared in various films, such as \"Paycheck\" (2003), \"Gamer\" (2009), and \"Cold in July\" (2014). In addition to his screen work, he has a strong background in theater, having appeared in Broadway productions of \"Chicago,\" \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\" and \"The Realistic Joneses.\"\n\nMichael C. Hall Dexter Salary\n\nWhat was Michael C. Hall's salary per episode of Dexter? For the middle seasons of the show, he earned $150,000 per episode. In the last two seasons, his salary was boosted to $350,000. That worked out to $4.5 million per season for those final two seasons.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMichael Carlyle Hall was born on February 1, 1971, in Raleigh, North Carolina. His mother, Janice (née Styons), worked as a mental health counselor, and his father, William Carlyle Hall, worked for IBM. When he was eleven years old, his father passed away from prostate cancer.\n\nIn 1989, Hall graduated from Ravenscroft School and continued his education at Earlham College, a liberal arts college in Indiana. He initially planned on becoming a lawyer, but after he graduated from college in 1993, he did not go to law school. Instead, he moved to New York City and attended New York University. He graduated from the graduate acting program in 1996. He actually first came into contact with acting and performance while still a student at Ravenscroft School. Throughout his years there, he sang in the choir and performed in productions of \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Oklahoma!\" and \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" While at Earlham College, he appeared in productions like \"Cabaret\".\n\nActing Career\n\nHall started his acting career in the theater. He appeared in several Off-Broadway productions like \"Macbeth\" at the New York Shakespeare Festival, \"Timon of Athens\" and \"Henry V\" at The Public Theater, and \"The English Teachers\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club. In August 1998, he played the role of Posthumus in a production of Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline.\" He was cast in his first Broadway role in 1999, in director Sam Mendes's revival of \"Cabaret,\" and then in 2003, he toured as a member of the cast of \"Chicago.\"\n\nIn 2001, Hall transitioned from the state to television screens when he was cast as David Fisher in the drama \"Six Feet Under.\" The show received high ratings and aired five seasons from 2001 to 2005. For his work on the show, Hall was nominated for several awards, including an Emmy Award and an AFI Award.\n\nIn 2006, Hall began starring in the Showtime series \"Dexter\" as the titular character Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter analyst who moonlights as a vigilante serial killer. The series ran from 2006 to 2013 and then was revived in 2021. For his work on \"Dexter,\" he received numerous award nominations, including five Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He actually won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 2010; that same year, he also won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series. Additionally, Hall also served as one of the executive producers of the series.\n\nWhile he was starring on screen in \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Dexter,\" he remained active in the theater. In 2005, he starred in an Off-Broadway production of Noah Haidle's \"Mr. Marmalade.\" After the end of \"Dexter\" in 2013, Hall returned to theater and starred in the Broadway play \"The Realistic Joneses\" in 2014. In 2014, he also starred in \"Hedwig and The Angry Inch\" on Broadway and remained in the role from October that year until January 2015. Other productions he has starred in include a NYTW stage production of \"Lazarus\" (2015-2016), which was created by David Bowie and Enda Walsh; an Off-Broadway production of \"Thom Pain (based on nothing)\" (October – December 2018); and the one-time-only Broadway musical, \"Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical,\" on February 3, 2019.\n\nOutside of television and theater, Hall has also appeared in numerous films. These include the thriller film \"Paycheck\" (2003), the science fiction film \"Gamer\" (2009), the drama \"The Trouble with Bliss\" (2011), the comedy \"Peep World\" (2012), the biographical drama \"Kill Your Darlings\" (2013), \"Cold in July\" (2014), the documentary film \"The Gettysburg Address\" (2017), and the Netflix thriller \"In the Shadow of the Moon\" (2019). Furthermore, he has lent his voice as a voice actor to several projects. He can be heard doing voice-over work for Dodge commercials, and he voiced the character Toffee in the animated show \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil,\" as well as Batman in the direct-to-video animated superhero film \"Justice League: Gods and Monsters\" (2015).\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHall married the actress Amy Spanger in 2002. They starred together in a production of the Broadway musical \"Chicago\" the summer after their wedding. They divorced in 2006. Then, in 2007, he began dating Jennifer Carpenter, his \"Dexter\" co-star. They eloped in January 2008 but ultimately filed for divorce in December 2010; their divorce was finalized in December 2011. Hall began dating Morgan Macgregor, an associate editor at the \"Los Angeles Review of Books,\" in September 2012. They got married in February 2016 and reside in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIn January 2010, Hall's agent confirmed reports that Hall was currently receiving treatment for a form of Hodgkin's lymphoma. He was fully in remission by April 2010. In 2011, he became the celebrity spokesperson for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's fundraising campaign, \"Light the Night Walk\". Other charities he has worked with include the Somalia Aid Society—he was the face of their \"Feed The People\" campaign; and the Waterkeeper Alliance—he promoted a limited-edition skincare line with Kiehl's to support their work.\n\nReal Estate\n\nMichael owns a number of impressive properties. In December 2017, he paid $4.3 million for an apartment in New York City above Central Park West. Roughly a year earlier he sold a home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles for $4.85 million, roughly $1 million more than he paid a few years earlier. Two weeks after this sale, he paid $4.2 million for an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York City. In April 2024, Michael listed his Central Park West apartment for $3.75 million, which, as you may have noticed, would be a roughly $600 thousand loss compared to what he paid in 2017."
