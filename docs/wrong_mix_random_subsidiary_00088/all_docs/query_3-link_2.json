        "text": "Highest Rated: 88% Justice League: Gods and Monsters (2015)\n\nLowest Rated: 24% Peep World (2010)\n\nBirthday: Feb 1, 1971\n\nBirthplace: Raleigh, North Carolina, USA\n\nDespite a résumé consisting of experience exclusive to the theater, Michael C. Hall quickly became a recognizable figure on the small screen, establishing himself in chameleon-like fashion in diverse and often contradictory roles that earned the young actor a strong and loyal following, particularly with his breakthrough performance as the uptight gay mortician David Fisher on \"Six Feet Under\" (HBO, 2001-05). Prior to HBO's darkly comic take on dysfunctional families, Hall was a vaunted thespian best known for taking over Alan Cumming's role as the sexually insinuating emcee in a Broadway production of \"Cabaret\" - a stark contrast to his part on \"Six Feet Under\" and to the actor himself. Hall's penchant for playing conflicting characters enabled him to engage his imagination and breathe life into unique creations far different from most others seen on television, making him a much-sought after actor. This knack culminated with his portrayal of a serial killer of serial killers on \"Dexter\" (Showtime, 2006-13), a darkly comic twist on a classic genre that elevated Hall to a well known commodity.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n88% Christine 85% Game Night\n\n84% Cold in July\n\n83% The Report\n\n76% Kill Your Darlings\n\n60% John and the Hole 36% Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House\n\n33% The Trouble With Bliss\n\nPhotos\n\nMichael C.
