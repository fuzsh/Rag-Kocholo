        "text": "Year of Release: 2024 ⌃\n\nLarry Roberts\n\nCalifornia — Conviction: 1983 , Charges Dismissed: 2024\n\nLarry Roberts (pictured middle) was sentenced to death in 1983 for the murders of a fellow prisoner Charles Gardner and prison officer Albert Patch at California Medical Facility based largely on the eyewitness testimony of fellow prisoners. Although Mr. Roberts was sentenced to death, his co-defendant Larry Menefield, who was likewise found guilty in a joint trial, was sentenced to life without parole. In 1992, the California Supreme Court reversed Mr. Roberts’ conviction for Mr. Patch, as well as the multiple-murder special-circumstance finding. Years later, one of the state’s eyewitnesses admitted to perjury, explaining that he was threatened by investigators at the time of the incident, and information regarding the competency of another eyewitness, who had been declared insane by three court-appointed psychiatrists, was discovered to have been withheld from the defense. After a U.S. District Court ordered a new trial for Mr. Roberts, the California Attorney General said that a “retrial is not reasonably feasible” due to a lack of available witnesses, many of whom are deceased or of old age. On June 29, 2024 (filed July 1, 2024), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California vacated his conviction and death sentence, making Mr. Roberts the 200th person exonerated from U.S. death row.\n\nSources\n\nSee July 1, 2024 Court Order; See June 21, 2024 Court Order; MAURA DOLAN, Judge to Investigate Misconduct Charges in Death Row Case, Los Angeles Times, April 25, 2000; People v. Roberts (1992), Supreme Court of California;\n\nKerry Max Cook\n\nTexas — Conviction: 1978 , Appellate Acquittal: 2024\n\nMr. Cook, who was tried three times, was originally sentenced to death for the 1977 murder of Linda Jo Edwards. His original 1978 conviction was vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which then reversed the conviction in 1991. In 1992, a mistrial was declared during Mr. Cook’s second trial due to the jury’s inability to reach a unanimous verdict. Despite the disclosure of evidence previously withheld during the first trial, Mr. Cook was tried a third time, resulting in a conviction and death sentence in 1994. Once again, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found Mr. Cook’s right to due process was violated, reversed the conviction in 1996, and remanded the case to the trial court. Prior to what would have been his fourth trial in 1999, Mr. Cook pled “no contest” in exchange for a 20-year sentence and was released from prison for time-served. Following an alternate suspect’s recantation of his false testimony, the trial court held hearings regarding a “Stipulation and Settlement Agreement” between the state and Mr. Cook in 2016. On August 16, 2016, the trial court recommended Mr. Cook be granted relief based on the false testimony but found that the new evidence did not prove his innocence. “Marked by bookends of deception spanning over 40 years,” the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has now found Mr. Cook to be innocent.\n\nSources\n\nZach Despart, Texas court finds Kerry Max Cook innocent of 1977 murder, ending decades-long quest for exoneration, The Texas Tribune, June 19, 2024; Read the opinion here.\n\nDaniel Gwynn\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 1995 , Charges Dismissed: 2024\n\nOn February 27, 2024, Common Pleas Court Judge Barbara A. McDermott approved a motion from the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office to dismiss first-degree murder, arson, and aggravated assault charges against 54-year-old death-sentenced prisoner Daniel Gwynn. Mr. Gwynn is the 197th person exonerated after being sentenced to death since 1973, according to DPIC’s Innocence Database. Pennsylvania is now the fourth state with 13 exonerations and Philadelphia is now the second county to lead U.S. death-row exonerations since 1973.\n\n“[T]he exoneration of Daniel Gwynn today frees a man who is likely innocent. Sadly, it also exemplifies an era of inexact and, at times corrupt, policing and prosecution that has broken trust with our communities to this day,” said District Attorney Larry Krasner, whose office has supported the exoneration of 41 wrongfully convicted people. “The public expects the right consequences for those who commit violent crimes, and wants the innocent to be free. When law enforcement wrongly arrests, prosecutes, and imprisons the innocent, the guilty go free and are emboldened to do more harm.”\n\nMr. Gwynn’s wrongful 1995 conviction for the 1994 death of Marsha Smith was based on false confession and mistaken eyewitness testimony. Assistant District Attorney David Napiorski, who led the federal habeas relief investigation, explains that key details of Mr. Gwynn’s confession contradicted physical evidence, including how and where the fire started and which exit of the house was used. Mr. Gwynn has also explained that his confession was coerced, writing on Art for Justice that “During the interrogation, as I was withdrawing from cocaine, the Detectives took advantage of my addled brain. They lied, manipulated information and made gestured threats to hurt me. Beaten by the police in the past, I felt their threats were real.” The photo array police showed to witnesses did not include a photo of Mr. Gwynn, according to the DA’s office, and were never disclosed to defense counsel. Prosecution also failed to disclose additional evidence pointing to a different suspect.\n\nSources\n\nDA’s Federal Litigation Unit Secures Exoneration of Former Death Row Prisoner Daniel Gwynn, Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, February 28, 2024; Jesse Bunch, Philly judge has dis­missed charges against death-row inmate Daniel Gwynn in 1994 arson mur­der, The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 28, 2024; 6abc Digital Staff and TaRhonda Thomas, Judge throws out man’s con­vic­tion for dead­ly 1994 fire in West Philadelphia, February 29, 2024; Raymond Strickland, Adam Fox, Philadelphia man exon­er­at­ed after near­ly 30 years of impris­on­ment for dead­ly 1994 arson, CBSNews Philadelphia, February 28, 2024; Daniel Gwynn, My Story, My Art, Art for Justice, Date Unknown;\n\nYear of Release: 2023 ⌃\n\nNoel Montalvo\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 2003 , Charges Dismissed: 2023\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Pennsylvania dropped all homicide charges against Noel Montalvo, twenty years after he was convicted and sentenced to death in York County. Mr. Montalvo pled guilty to one count of tampering with evidence in exchange for release and one year on probation.\n\nMr. Montalvo’s brother Milton was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000 for the 1998 murders of his estranged common-law wife, Miriam Ascencio, and her new boyfriend, Nelson Lugo. A neighbor found Ms. Ascencio and Mr. Lugo stabbed to death the morning after the couple had gone out together to a local bar. DNA testing of over 70 items at the scene matched blood and hair to Milton but found no trace of Noel. Another neighbor saw Milton alone at Ms. Ascencio’s door that night and heard him shouting. Nonetheless, prosecutors later tried Noel for the murders and he was sentenced to death in 2003. Only one witness linked Noel to the crime, testifying that he had told her he murdered Ms. Ascencio, but the witness admitted on cross-examination that a detective had threatened her with jail time if she didn’t implicate Noel.\n\nIn 2019, a judge overturned Noel’s conviction and sentence based on his attorney’s ineffectiveness in several respects, including failing to present key mitigation evidence and challenge the trial judge’s error in jury instructions. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2021. Instead of pursuing a new trial for Noel, the parties eventually reached the plea agreement for his release. Under the agreement, Noel admitted only to leaving the state with his brother on the night of the murders. The physical evidence has been retested multiple times over the years and experts have definitively excluded Noel.\n\nNoel maintained his innocence for his entire incarceration, and Milton himself said that his brother was not involved. Interviewed outside of York County Prison after his release, Noel said that the carceral system needed to change because “too many people are really innocent” and “proof has sustained the innocence.”\n\nGlynn Simmons\n\nOklahoma — Conviction: 1975 , Charges Dismissed: 2023\n\nGlynn Simmons, who was convicted and sentenced to death in Oklahoma in 1975, has been exonerated after Oklahoma County District Attorney Vicki Behenna dropped charges against him. Mr. Simmons told The Black Wall Street Times, “I’m happy, and I’m free. It’s a long, long struggle. … We need to reimagine justice and how we do it.” DA Behenna said of the case, \"One of the things that I stand by very strongly is a defendant's right to a fair trial, where he has all the evidence to defend himself. That didn't happen here.\"\n\nMr. Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Carolyn Sue Rogers and wounding of another woman at a liquor store. Prosecutors said the surviving victim identified Mr. Simmons out of a line up, but never told the jury or defense team that she had also identified other people in the line up. In 1977, his sentence was reduced to life in prison as a result of a U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nIn July 2023, at the request of DA Behenna, Judge Amy Palumbo vacated Mr. Simmons’ conviction and ordered a new trial. Mr. Simmons was released on bond. On September 11, 2023, DA Behenna announced she was requesting dismissal of the case against Mr. Simmons. In a press release, she said, “the District Attorney determined the state will not be able to meet its burden at trial and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Simmons was responsible for Ms. Rogers’ murder.” She explained that there was no longer any physical evidence in the case, witnesses and detectives were deceased or unavailable, and “The defense alleges that their alternate suspect was identified in one of the lineups.” On September 19, 2023, Judge Palumbo granted DA Behenna’s request, dismissing the charges against Mr. Simmons.\n\nJesse Johnson\n\nOregon — Conviction: 2004 , Charges Dismissed: 2023\n\nOn September 5, 2023, Jesse Johnson was released from Marion County Jail in Oregon when prosecutors formally declined to retry him for the 1998 murder of Harriet Thompson. Mr. Johnson was convicted of Ms. Thompson’s murder in 2004 and sentenced to death. In asking the Marion County Circuit Court to dismiss the case against Mr. Johnson, the county District Attorney’s office stated that “based upon the amount of time that has passed and the unavailability of critical evidence in this case, the state no longer believes that it can prove the defendant’s guilt.” Mr. Johnson was housed on death row at Oregon State Penitentiary until 2021, when the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned his case, agreeing that he had inadequate defense counsel who failed to interview a key witness. Patricia Hubbard, one of victim’s neighbors, claims that police repeatedly “dismissed her attempts to give them information” about an alternate suspect, and also claims a detective said a Black woman was murdered and Black man was “going to pay for it.”\n\nSince his arrest, Mr. Johnson has maintained his innocence and lack of involvement in Ms. Thompson’s murder, refusing to accept any plea deals during his 25 years behind bars. There was no DNA evidence directly connecting Mr. Johnson to the murder and the prosecution relied heavily on circumstantial evidence that placed him in the victim’s home. Fingerprints were found belonging to Mr. Johnson, but his attorneys note that this only proves they knew each other, which Mr. Johnson had previously admitted. Ms. Hubbard spoke with defense investigators in 2013 while they were reinvestigating the case and told them that she saw a white man flee Ms. Thompson’s apartment on the night of her murder after she heard loud arguing. Mr. Johnson’s original defense attorneys never spoke with Ms. Hubbard and made little effort to speak with additional neighbors. Prosecutors knew about Ms. Hubbard’s testimony and the additional DNA evidence pointing towards other suspects prior to the 2021 Oregon Court of Appeals decision.\n\nSources\n\nSources: Ryan Haas and Leah Sottile, Oregon prosecutors drop murder case against Jesse Johnson, ending 25-year legal saga, Oregon Public Broadcasting, September 6, 2023; Andrew Selsky, Oregon man who was sentenced to death is free 2 years after murder conviction was reversed, Associated Press, September 6, 2023.\n\nJohn Huffington\n\nMaryland — Conviction: 1981 , Pardoned: 2023\n\nJohn Huffington has been exonerated of all the charges that sent him to death row over 40 years after his initial wrongful conviction in 1981. On January 13, 2023, outgoing Maryland Governor Larry Hogan granted a full pardon to Huffington, stating that evidence conclusively showed that his “convictions were in error.”\n\nAfter many appeals and two death sentences, Huffington eventually entered an “Alford Plea” in 2017, which led to a reduced sentence and eventually his release. This type of plea is used when a defendant maintains their innocence but concedes that existing evidence might result in their being found guilty.\n\nJoseph Cassilly, the former prosecutor in Huffington’s case, was disbarred in 2021 for his actions in this and other cases. In Huffington’s case, hair found at the scene of the crime was identified using a discredited method that falsely concluded it was microscopically identical to Huffington’s hair. The FBI and the Department of Justice reviewed Huffington’s case and determined that the forensic evidence was scientifically inaccurate. Cassilly, however, withheld this exculpatory evidence from Huffington’s attorneys.\n\nAttorneys from the Ropes & Gray law firm represented Huffington on a pro bono basis for more than 30 years. When the pardon was finally granted, Huffington stated, “I have fought for over 40 years for this day, and I feel a deep sense of closure and vindication. This pardon officially acknowledges that I was wrongly convicted and imprisoned for crimes I never committed.\"\n\nYear of Release: 2022 ⌃\n\nMarilyn Mulero\n\nIllinois — Conviction: 1993 , Charges Dismissed: 2022\n\nMarilyn Mulero and two teenage girls, 15-year-old Jacqueline Montanez and 16-year-old Madeline Mendoza, were charged with luring two gang members to a Chicago park where they were shot to death, allegedly in retaliation for a prior gang killing. Mulero, who was 21, was interrogated by disgraced former Chicago detective Reynaldo Guevara, who has been implicated in framing more than fifty innocent people for murder, and former Chicago Police Detective Ernest Halvorsen. Over the course of a 20-hour period, she was denied sleep and access to counsel and threatened with the death penalty and with having her children taken away. Mulero eventually signed a statement prepared by the detectives confessing to one of the murders.\n\nMulero’s family retained a private lawyer to represent her who had never handled a death penalty case. The lawyer, Jeremiah Lynch, did not conduct any investigation into the murder and met with Mulero three times. After the trial court denied her motion to suppress the confession, Lynch advised her to plead guilty to first-degree murder, without first obtaining an agreement from the prosecution to drop the death penalty. Mulero pled guilty on September 27, 1993, and Lynch withdrew from the case. Cook County prosecutors continued to pursue the death penalty against her, and at a capital sentencing trial in November 1993, she became the first woman in the modern era of the U.S. death penalty to be sentenced to death in Illinois.\n\nIn May 1997, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned her conviction because her trial prosecutor had improperly cross-examined her about the suppression motion and then argued to the jury that her answers indicated a failure to express remorse. The jury in her November 1998 capital sentencing retrial sentenced her to life without parole. In January 2017, Montanez admitted that she had committed both murders and that Mulero had no involvement in the crimes. In 2019, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker commuted Mulero’s sentence to time served, and she was released on April 9, 2020. In August 2022, Cook County prosecutors moved to dismiss all charges against eight people, including Mulero, whom Guevara had framed for murder. The trial court formally dismissed the charges against Mulero on August 9, 2022.\n\nSamuel Randolph, IV\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 2003 , Acquitted: 2022\n\nSam Randolph was convicted and sentenced to death in May 2003 on charges that he had murdered two men in a shooting in a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania bar in 2001. He was represented at trial by appointed counsel, Allen Welch, who was at the same time running for district attorney in a neighboring county. Randolph repeatedly expressed concern to the trial court that Welch was not prepared for trial and did “not have [his] best interest” in mind, and that they had irreconcilable differences regarding the approach to the case.\n\nBy the time of trial, Randolph and Welch were not speaking, and the court appointed another lawyer, who had no capital case experience, to act as an intermediary between the two. Randolph's family attempted to sell assets so they could retain private counsel, but the sale did not go through until a week before trial. Retained counsel sought a continuance to prepare for trial, which the trial court denied. The court then refused counsel's request to delay jury section for a few days to permit counsel to review the discovery in the case, and ultimately refused to delay the start of jury selection more than hour even though retained counsel had a pre-scheduled proceeding in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that morning. Represented by Welch, Randolph was convicted. Randolph represented himself in the penalty phase. Saying he had been denied counsel of choice at trial, he refused to present any mitigating evidence and was sentenced to death.\n\nIn federal habeas corpus proceedings, Randolph alleged that the murders were actually committed by one local group of drug dealers in retaliation for a prior killing by a rival group. Police and prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence that, during a search of a house owned by one of the drug dealers, they had recovered clothing resembling what eyewitnesses said the killers had worn during the shooting. Another witness came forward with evidence that the second victim killed in the bar had been shot by accident when one of his associates returned fire at the gunmen.\n\nThe federal district court held an evidentiary hearing on Randolph's innocence claim, but did not reach the issue, instead granting him a new trial on his claim that he had been denied counsel of choice. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed that ruling on July 20, 2021. On April 4, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court denied prosecutors' petition for review and, two days later, on April 6, 2022, the Dauphin County District Attorney filed an application to discontinue the prosecution.\n\nYear of Release: 2021 ⌃\n\nSherwood Brown\n\nMississippi — Conviction: 1995 , Charges Dismissed: 2021\n\nn August 2021, Sherwood Brown was exonerated of a triple murder that sent him to Mississippi’s death row in 1995.\n\nBrown was sentenced to death for the murder of 13-year-old Evangela Boyd and received two life sentences for the murders of her mother and grandmother. His convictions and death sentence rested in substantial part on false expert forensic testimony, as well as the perjured testimony of a jailhouse informant. The informant was facing serious charges for car theft when he claimed Brown had confessed to the murders. Prosecutors argued that blood found on the sole of one of Brown’s shoes came from the victims, and two forensic bitemark analysts falsely claimed that a cut on Brown’s wrist was a bitemark that matched the girl’s bite pattern.\n\nDNA evidence later contradicted the prosecution’s narrative. The evidence showed that bloody footprints in and around the murder scene contained only female DNA and the blood spot on Brown’s shoe contained only male DNA. DNA testing on a swab of Boyd’s saliva did not contain Brown’s DNA, refuting the claim that she had bitten Brown. DNA tests on the sexual assault kit collected during the autopsy found no DNA from Brown but showed that Evangela Boyd’s pubic hair and her bra contained DNA from unidentified males. A forensic scientist from the Mississippi Crime Laboratory found that none of the hair evidence recovered from the clothing and bodies of the victims had any microscopic characteristics similar to Brown’s hair. A crime lab fingerprint analyst also found that none of the fingerprints found at the scene belonged to Brown.\n\nBased on this evidence, the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned Brown’s conviction and death sentence in October 2017. However, Brown remained in custody facing possible capital retrial as prosecutors attempted to build another case against him. With Brown in county pretrial custody, four more laboratories tested the DNA evidence over the course of three more years. Each came back with the same results. “Every time, there was nothing incriminating Sherwood,” said one of Brown’s attorneys after his exoneration. “The state was trying to find something to incriminate Sherwood, but every time they did, it kind of stumped them deeper.”\n\nFinally, on August 24, Mississippi Circuit Court Judge Jimmy McClure granted a prosecution motion to dismiss charges against Brown. He was released later that day after having spent 26 years on death row or facing the prospects of a capital retrial.\n\nEddie Lee Howard\n\nMississippi — Conviction: 1994 , Charges Dismissed: 2021\n\nEddie Lee Howard was convicted and sentenced to death in 1994 for the alleged rape and murder of an 84 year-old white woman. He represented himself at trial. The Mississippi Supreme Court overturned his conviction in 1997 and ordered a new trial. He was convicted and sentenced to death again in a retrial in 2000 at which forensic odontologist Dr. Michael West testified that Howard was the source of bite marks West claimed to have found on the victim’s body during a post-autopsy, post-exhumation examination. Forensic pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne conducted the autopsy in the case and claimed that the victim had been beaten, strangled, stabbed, and raped. His initial autopsy report did not mention bite marks.\n\nHoward’s lawyers presented DNA evidence during post-conviction evidentiary hearings in 2016 that eviscerated the prosecution’s false forensic testimony. DNA testing showed no evidence of semen or male DNA on the victim’s clothing, bedsheets, or body and no male DNA on the locations on the victim’s body where she supposedly had been bitten. None of the blood or other items tested contained Howard’s DNA. Male DNA found on the knife used by the murderer excluded Howard as the source.\n\nThe Mississippi Supreme Court overturned Howard’s conviction in August 2020, 26 years after he was first sentenced to death. In an 8-1 decision, the court held that the discredited bite-mark testimony, exculpatory DNA evidence, “and the paucity of other evidence linking Howard to the murder” entitled him to a new trial.\n\nHoward was freed pending retrial in December 2020 and on January 8, 2021, the trial court granted a motion by Lowndes County District Attorney Scott Colom to dismiss all charges against Howard. “After reading the supreme court’s opinion, reading the trial transcripts from the two trials, reviewing the investigative files and case files of the case, I decided that we didn’t have even remotely close to sufficient evidence to convict Mr. Howard beyond a reasonable doubt,” Colom said.\n\nBarry Williams\n\nCalifornia — Conviction: 1986 , Charges Dismissed: 2021\n\nBarry Williams was convicted and sentenced to death in 1986 for an allegedly gang-related murder in Los Angeles. His conviction rested on the false testimony of two prison informants, Arthur Cox and John Gardner, who claimed that Williams had admitted to involvement in the murder, and false testimony from an alleged eyewitness. Both informants later recanted. Cox said that prosecutors threatened to prosecute him as an accessory to another murder for which Williams was also charged, as well as for an unrelated robbery. In exchange for his testimony against Williams, the prosecution gave him cash, granted him immunity in the unrelated murder case, and arranged for early release from a marijuana charge. But at trial, he denied the existence of any deal. Gardner later said that prosecutors had pressured him into testifying and coached his false testimony, telling him “either Barry was going to do time for the murder or I was going to do time for the robbery.”\n\nDuring federal habeas corpus proceedings, Williams’ lawyers presented evidence that prosecutors had withheld significant exculpatory evidence including that: a taped interview with the alleged eyewitness contradicted much of her trial testimony and that prosecutors threatened to charge her when she expressed reluctance to identify Williams; numerous documents that undermined both the substance of Gardner’s testimony and memorialized undisclosed favorable treatment he received for his testimony; numerous undisclosed benefits Cox received for his cooperation in the case; evidence related to both informants’ drug usage; threatening another witness with the death penalty if he did not cooperate with the prosecution; and false testimony by several Los Angeles police detectives and a Los Angeles county judge.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the federal district court overturned Williams’ conviction because of prosecutorial misconduct. The court found that the prosecution had presented perjured testimony in a pretrial hearing in which Williams’ trial counsel had moved to bar Cox’s testimony on the grounds that Cox was an agent of the state who attempted to obtain information for police and prosecutors in violation of Williams’ right to counsel. It further found that prosecutors had presented perjured identification testimony from the alleged eyewitness. In both instances, the court found that prosecutors knew or should have known the testimony had been false.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office dismissed the case against Williams, exonerating him of all charges. He remains incarcerated on an unrelated murder conviction.\n\nYear of Release: 2020 ⌃\n\nRoderick Johnson\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 1997 , Charges Dismissed: 2020\n\nRoderick Johnson was exonerated on December 1, 2020, when Berks County Court of Common Pleas Judge Eleni Dimitriou Geishauser dismissed all charges against him in the 1996 double-murder of cousins Damon and Gregory Banks in Reading, Pennsylvania and issued an order discharging him from custody. Judge Geishauser called the prosecutorial misconduct in Johnson's case \"egregious\" and \"contemptuous.\"\n\nJohnson was convicted based largely on the testimony of drug dealer and police informant, George Robles, who had repeatedly avoided having criminal charges filed against him by cooperating with law enforcement in other cases. Though Johnson admitted being present at the crime scene, he denied any involvement in the murders. Robles claimed that Johnson owned a handgun like the one used in the crimes and that Johnson had confessed to wiping it down and disposing of it on the night the Bankses were killed. District Attorney Mark Baldwin suppressed police records documenting Robles’ uncharged criminal activity and his cooperation with police, and, according to Judge Geishauser, \"blatantly lied about his knowledge of the reports directly to the court.\"\n\n“Had these acts been committed by a witness,” Judge Geishauer wrote, “the individual could have been, and in all likelihood would have been, charged with obstruction of justice. Had these acts been committed by defense counsel, in addition to charges, a disciplinary action would have been initiated that would potentially result in the suspension or loss of legal license. Mr. Baldwin’s position as District Attorney seems to have protected him from such censure. But in this matter, all men are equal before the law and this court renders judgment of Mr. Baldwin’s egregious behavior.”\n\nPaul Browning\n\nNevada — Conviction: 1986 , Charges Dismissed: 2020\n\nPaul Browning was convicted and sentenced to death in 1986 for the robbery and murder of Las Vegas jeweler, Hugo Elson. Browning was represented at trial by a lawyer who had been practicing criminal defense for less than a year and failed to interview the police who responded to the scene, examine the evidence against Browning, or investigate the crime. The Nevada Supreme Court overturned Browning’s death sentence in 2004 as a result of counsel’s ineffective assistance in the penalty phase of trial, but a second jury — hearing the same evidence against him — resentenced him to death in 2007.\n\nIn his post-conviction appeal, Browning presented evidence that police and prosecutors had withheld evidence of a bloody footprint found at the scene that did not match Browning’s shoes or foot size, misrepresented blood evidence in the case, manipulated eyewitness testimony, failed to disclose benefits it offered to a key witness who may have committed the murder and framed Browning, and that the stab wounds suffered by the victim were inconsistent with wounds that would have been produced by the knife prosecutors claimed Browning had used to commit the killing. Browning also argued that a minimally competent defense investigation would have revealed the flaws in the prosecution’s evidence and the falsity of the representations the prosecution had made to the jury.\n\nThe prosecution’s case unraveled in the post-conviction proceedings. Prosecutors told the jury that Elsen’s blood had been found on a tan jacket owned by Browning. Elsen, however, had survived long enough to give police a description of his assailant, whom he said had worn a blue jacket. Later DNA testing showed that of the blood on Browning’s jacket was not Elsen’s. Elsen also said his assailant had shoulder-length Jheri curls, which was completely inconsistent with Browning’s Afro-styled hair. Elsen’s wife failed to identify Browning in a lineup, but later testified at trial that he was the killer. A white witness who worked near the crime scene told police she had seen a man run by after the murder and thought it could have been Browning, but when police asked if she could be “more sure” about whom she had seen, she said, “No, I wouldn’t think so. No … They all look the same, and that’s just what I think when I see a black person, that they all look the same.” At trial, though, she unhesitatingly testified that Browning was the man she had seen.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned Browning’s conviction. Then, in March 2019, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon ­dismissed the charges against Browning saying the deaths of key witnesses made it impossible for him to receive a fair trial. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Judge Herndon's decision on January 24, 2020.\n\nSources\n\nRead: Rachel Crosby, Inmate released from Nevada prison after decades on death row, Las Vegas Review-Journal, August 21, 2019.\n\nDavid Ferrara, Man with dis­missed mur­der con­vic­tion still on death row in Nevada, Las Vegas Review-Journal, August 8, 2019.\n\nRead the fed­er­al appeals court opin­ion in Browning v.

Barbara Jean Horn was murdered in 1988, her body discovered in a cardboard box the killer placed on the street for trash collection. The case was unsolved for four years before being reassigned to Detectives Martin Devlin and Paul Worrell, two Philadelphia homicide detectives who had undisclosed history of coercing false confessions. No physical evidence linked Ogrod to the murder, but after being sleep deprived over the course of 14 hours of interrogation, he confessed to having beaten the young girl to death with an exercise barbell.\n\nEven with the confession, the prosecution case was weak, and the jury in Ogrod's 1993 trial was prepared to acquit him. However, as the court was preparing to read the verdict, one juror changed his mind. With the jury hung at 11-1, the court declared a mistrial. Before Ogrod's second trial in 1996, prosecutors engaged the assistance of John Hall, a notorious jailhouse informant whom they nicknamed “the Monsignor,” who gathered newspaper articles about the case and had his wife write to Ogrod, posing as a stripper, trying to obtain information. Hall then fed information to another jailhouse informant, Jay Wolchansky, who also falsely claimed that Ogrod had confessed to him. Based on the confession and the informant testimony, Ogrod was sentenced to death.\n\nAfter reviewing the case, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Conviction Integrity Unit reported that Ogrod's conviction had been \"a gross miscarriage of justice,\" marred by police and prosecutorial misconduct, false forensic testimony, and fabricated informant testimony. The CIU said prosecutors had known at the time of trial that Barbara Jean had died of asphyxia and had not been beaten to death, but withheld the medical examiner's report and presented false testimony on the cause of death. They also failed to disclose what the CIU called a \"snitch scheme\" to fabricate a confession, and withheld information on benefits provided to the informants, Wolchansky's mental illness, and Hall's informant history. New DNA testing was conducted on the physical evidence, which “produced a full male DNA profile suitable for comparison” that excluded Ogrod as a contributor. The CIU and defense counsel jointly moved the court to overturn Ogrod's conviction. He was granted a new trial and released on bail on June 5, 2020, and all charges against him were dropped on June 10.\n\nKareem Johnson\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 2006 , Charges Dismissed: 2020\n\nKareem Johnson was exonerated on July 1, 2020, when a Philadelphia trial court formally entered an order dismissing all charges against him in his capital case. On May 19, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had barred his reprosecution because of prosecutorial misconduct that it said exhibited a conscious and reckless disregard for his right to a fair trial.\n\nJohnson’s wrongful conviction and death sentence were a product of official misconduct, false forensic evidence, and ineffective representation. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2007 based upon evidence and argument falsely informing the jury that DNA evidence had linked him to the murder. The prosecution, police, and a prosecution forensic analyst told the jury that Johnson had shot the victim, Walter Smith, at such close range that Smith’s blood spattered onto a red baseball cap Johnson was wearing that supposedly had been recovered at the murder scene. Philadelphia homicide prosecutor Michael Barry falsely linked Johnson to the murder through the hat, telling jurors in his opening statement that it “was left at th[e] scene in the middle of the street [and] has Kareem Johnson’s sweat on it and has Walter Smith’s blood on it.”\n\nOfficer William Trenwith then testified that he had found the hat laying 8–10 feet from Smith’s body. He further told the jury that, in his years of investigating homicide, he had never seen blood travel that far a distance from a victim’s body. Based on that testimony, Barry told jurors: “We know that he [Kareem Johnson] got in real close, within 2½ feet, close enough so that Walter Smith’s blood could splash up onto the bill of the cap he was wearing.” Barry argued: “Do you know who says the killer wore the hat? Walter Smith says the killer wore the hat. He says it with his blood.”\n\nIn fact, there was no blood on the red hat, nor did the police property receipt for the hat contain any indication of blood. Smith’s blood was actually on a second hat — a black hat he was wearing at the time he was shot in the head. The DNA reports for the red hat also raised questions about the sweat stain attributed to Johnson. The initial DNA report on the sweat stain — which was supplemented twice without explanation — did not link the hat to Johnson.\n\nWhen post-conviction counsel for Johnson discovered the discrepancies in the evidence, police and prosecutors claimed to have mixed up the hats. The Philadelphia DA’s office agreed that Johnson’s conviction should be overturned but stipulated to its reversal in April 2015 based only “on ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilty-innocence phase of trial.” Prosecutors insisted at the time of the stipulation that Johnson “agree[ ] to withdraw all other claims … including claims alleging prosecutorial misconduct of District Attorney Michael Barry.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled on May 19, 2020 that the prosecutorial misconduct in the case violated the double jeopardy protections of the Pennsylvania constitution. The court ruled that Philadelphia prosecutors had engaged in misconduct that denied Johnson a fair trial and was \"undertaken recklessly, that is, with a conscious disregard for a substantial risk that such will be the result.”\n\nCurtis Flowers\n\nMississippi — Conviction: 1997 , Charges Dismissed: 2020\n\nOn September 4, 2020, following six trials marred by prosecutorial misconduct and racial prejudice, Curtis Flowers was exonerated of the July 1996 murders of four employees of a white-owned furniture store in Winona, Mississippi. Fifth Circuit Court District Attorney Doug Evans tried all six cases before withdrawing from the case in January 2020. After an independent investigation, the Mississippi Attorney General's office filed a motion on September 4, 2020 to dismiss all charges against Flowers, with prejudice, and the trial court granted the motion.\n\nEvans first prosecuted Flowers for the murder of one of the victims in October 1997. An all-white jury sentenced Flowers — who is African American — to death. While Flowers’ appeal of his conviction in that trial was pending, Evans tried Flowers in March 1999 for the murder of a second victim. Just before that trial, Flowers’ parents’ house burned down and his mother was told of a threat made by a white resident that, “If they let that n——- go, another house is going to burn.” This time, a jury of 11 white jurors and one black juror convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death.\n\nIn separate rulings in 2000 and 2003, the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned both convictions, both times citing prosecutorial misconduct. Evans proceeded to try Flowers a third time in February 2004, again with a jury composed of 11 white jurors and one black juror. Flowers was again convicted and sentenced to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court then overturned that conviction, this time citing Evans’ discriminatory use of jury strikes against African Americans.\n\nJurors deadlocked in Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials in November 2007 and September 2008, split along racial lines. Evans again personally prosecuted both trials. The seven white jurors in the fourth trial and the nine white jurors in the fifth trial voted for death. The five black jurors in the fourth trial and three black jurors in the fifth trial voted for life. Only one black juror served on the sixth jury in 2010 — again prosecuted by Evans — and Flowers was sentenced to death a fourth time in that trial.\n\nWhile it was working its way through the appeals process, the Flowers case became the subject of an American Public Media podcast, APM Reports’ In the Dark. The podcast uncovered new evidence questioning Flowers’ guilt, including evidence pointing to another suspect and a taped admission from jailhouse informant Odell Hallmon — the state’s star witness who had testified that Flowers had confessed to the murders — that “He ain’t never tell me that. That was a lie. … Everything was all make-believe on my part.”\n\nAPM also conducted a study of prosecutors’ exercise of discretionary jury strikes in 225 trials between 1992 and 2017 during Evans’ tenure as Fifth Circuit Court District Attorney, finding that prosecutors in Evans’ office excluded African Americans from jury service at nearly 4½ times the rate at which they struck white jurors. On June 21, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Flowers’ conviction again based on Evans’ racially discriminatory jury selection practices. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that Evans’ “relentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals strongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a jury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an all-white jury.”\n\nRobert DuBoise\n\nFlorida — Conviction: 1983 , Charges Dismissed: 2020\n\nA Hillsborough County, Florida trial court exonerated Robert DuBoise on September 14, 2020, dismissing all charges against him 37 years after he was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death for rape and murder.\n\nDuBoise was convicted of raping and murdering 19-year-old Barbara Grams based on junk-science bite-mark evidence and false testimony from a prison informant. The jury unanimously recommended that DuBoise be sentenced to life, but his trial judge, Henry Lee Coe III, overrode their recommendation and sentenced DuBoise to death. In February 1988, the Florida Supreme Court overturned DuBoise’s death sentence, ruling that the trial court should not have overridden the jury’s sentencing recommendation and directing that DuBoise be resentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nDuBoise remained wrongly incarcerated until August 27, 2020, one day after Hillsborough prosecutors and lawyers from the national Innocence Project and the Innocence Project of Florida presented Circuit Judge Christopher Nash with evidence of his innocence. Working with State Attorney Andrew Warren’s Conviction Integrity Unit, the parties told the court that there was in fact no bite mark and that DNA evidence from an untested rape kit excluded DuBoise and implicated two other men. Judge Nash reduced DuBoise's sentence to time served and set a September 14 hearing date for the presentation of evidence to overturn his conviction.\n\nYear of Release: 2019 ⌃\n\nChristopher Williams\n\nPennsylvania — Conviction: 1993 , Charges Dismissed: 2019\n\nOn December 23, 2019, correcting what it characterized as \"decades\" of misconduct, the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office dropped all charges against Christopher Williams, who had been on death row for 26 years. Williams and a 17-year-old co-defendant, Theophalis Wilson, had been wrongfully convicted in August 1993 of a triple murder committed in North Philadelphia in 1989.\n\nThe two men's convictions rested on the perjured testimony of a Commonwealth informant and the deliberate suppression of exculpatory evidence by former Philadelphia prosecutors. The state’s key witness was James White, who cooperated with the prosecution in exchange for avoiding capital prosecution for six different murders. White provided purportedly eyewitness testimony that Williams had shot one of the victims in the face and that several men threw the bodies of the victims out of a moving car. White later recanted his testimony, saying that prosecutors had met with him several times before Williams’ and Wilson’s trials and provided him with fabricated information for his testimony.\n\nIn December 2013, a Philadelphia trial court overturned Williams' conviction based upon forensic and medical evidence showing that White's version of how the murder occurred was physically impossible. It found that Williams' trial lawyer had failed to investigate the crime scene or retain necessary forensic experts and ineffectively failed to present expert evidence to challenge White’s “eyewitness” testimony. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that “[t]his [expert] testimony, if believed by the jury, coupled with the other evidence impeaching White’s credibility, would likely have changed the jury’s mind and resulted in Williams’ acquittal of the three murders.”\n\nWhile Williams was awaiting retrial, Philadelphia elected a new district attorney who created an active Conviction Integrity Unit. The CIU began investigating Wilson's case and later expanded its review to Williams' trial. In 2019, the CIU provided defense lawyers more than 40,000 pages of documents in the case, most of which had previously been withheld from the defense at trial and throughout the appeals process. In its motion to drop the charges against Williams, the CIU wrote that the prior prosecutors in the case, who had been fired, had withheld “a plethora of significant material, exculpatory evidence,” including “evidence that contradicted White’s account; impeached other witnesses; inculpated other specific individuals; and indicated that the victims in this case were caught in an ongoing dispute between two extremely violent gangs, either of which may have been responsible for their deaths.”\n\nThe trial court granted the prosecution's motion to \"nolle pros\" the charges against Williams, and, on January 21, 2020, charges were also dropped against Wilson. Williams remains in custody for a separate murder conviction obtained by the same homicide prosecutor with testimony from the same informant.\n\nSources\n\nSamantha Melamed, A bru­tal triple mur­der, an eager infor­mant, hid­den evi­dence, and now, exon­er­a­tion, The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 8, 2020.\n\nSamantha Melamed, A ​‘per­fect storm’ of injus­tice: Philly man freed after 28 years as DA con­demns ​‘decades’ of mis­con­duct, The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 21, 2020.\n\nRead the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's July 19, 2016 opinion in Commonwealth v.

In July 1976, Finch had been convicted by a Wilson County, North Carolina of shooting a store clerk to death during an attempted robbery. The charges carried an automatic death sentence. The same day he was formally sentenced, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Woodson v. North Carolina, which declared mandatory death sentences unconstitutional. Based on that decision, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed Finch’s death sentence and directed that he be resentenced to life without parole.\n\nFinch was identified by an eyewitness, Lester Floyd Jones, in three suggestive police line-ups in which police had him wear a three-quarter length jacket that was the same style of clothing that a store employee had said the perpetrator was wearing. No other person in the line-up was similarly dressed. Finch did not resemble the initial description that Jones—an alcoholic with cognitive impairments and problems with short-term memory—had given police. At the time of the murder, Finch had a long beard and distinctive sideburns, and by the time of his testimony, he changed his description of the shooter to match Finch.\n\nJones also had told police that the killer had been armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a state forensic witness testified at the trial that the victim had died from two shotgun wounds. When police arrested Finch, they found a shotgun shell in his car and the prosecution claimed that this shell matched the bullet casings found at the murder scene. A review of the autopsy evidence decades after the crime disclosed that the victim had been killed with a pistol, not a shotgun and new ballistics evidence contradicted the prosecution testimony that the bullets at the scene matched the shotgun shell from Finch’s car.\n\nThree alibi witnesses testified that Finch had been playing poker with them at the time of the shooting. Several witnesses for the prosecution later indicated they had been pressured into providing false testimony implicating Finch.\n\nOn January 25, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found Finch “actually innocent” of the murder and remanded his case to the federal district court to consider evidence that the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence in the case. The federal district court vacated Finch’s conviction on May 23, 2019 and ordered the 81-year-old's immediate release from prison, giving the state 30 days to decide whether to retry him. On June 14, 2019, the Wilson County District Attorney dismissed all charges in the case, completing Finch’s exoneration.\n\nSources\n\nRose Wang, Free after 43 years: How Duke's Wrongful Convictions Clinic freed an innocent man, The Duke Chronicle, June 23, 2019.\n\nOlivia Neeley, Judge orders Finch to be released, The Wilson Times, May 23, 2019.\n\nOlivia Neeley, Federal court rules in Finch’s favor, The Wilson Times, January 28, 2019.\n\nJosh Shaffer, He’s spent 43 years in prison.

Submitting a report from its Conviction Integrity Unit that found “no credible evidence of guilt and … credible evidence of innocence,” Duval County prosecutors asked a Jacksonville trial court to dismiss all charges against Williams, now 76 years old, and his nephew, Nathan Myers, now 61. Williams is the 165th former death-row prisoner to be exonerated in the United States since 1973.\n\nWilliams and Myers were tried and convicted in 1976 for the murder of Jeanette Williams and the wounding of her girlfriend, Nina Marshall. Marshall told police that two men had entered their bedroom at night and fired shots from the foot of the bed. She identified Williams and Myers as the shooters. However, the physical evidence — never presented by defense counsel — revealed that the bullets had been fired from outside, through the bedroom window, and had come from a single gun. Defense counsel also ignored forty alibi witnesses whom Williams and Myers had indicated would be able to testify that they had been next door at a birthday party at the time the shooting occurred. The defense presented no witnesses. The first trial resulted in a mistrial. In the second trial, which lasted two days, prosecutors argued, without presenting any supporting evidence, that the men committed the murder because Jeannette Williams supposedly owed them a $50 drug debt. The jury convicted Williams and Myers but recommended that they be sentenced to life. Judge Cliff Shepard — a notoriously harsh trial judge — overrode the jury’s sentencing recommendation for Williams and sentenced him to death. Shepard accepted the life recommendation for 18-year-old Myers.\n\nProsecutors began reinvestigating the case after newly elected State Attorney Melissa Nelson created the first Conviction Integrity Unit in the state in 2018. The unit issued its report, authored by Conviction Integrity Review Director Shelley Thibodeau, in February. The report noted that no physical evidence linked Williams or Myers to the shooting and that “the physical and scientific evidence actually contradicts [Marshall’s] testimony about what happened.” The report also found that another man, Nathaniel Lawson, had confessed to several people that he had committed the killings and that a 1976 police report noted his presence near the crime scene around the time of the murder. Thibodeau concluded that \"[t]he culmination of all the evidence, most of which the jury never heard or saw, leaves no abiding confidence in the convictions or the guilt of the defendants.”\n\nWilliams had been trying unsuccessfully for years to get anyone interested in the case, and responded emotionally after the hearing. “My mother died while I was on death row,” he told Florida Times-Union reporter Andrew Pantazi. Through tears, he said, “I just wanted to get out and see my kids. There wasn’t nobody but them.”\n\nTwenty-nine wrongfully convicted death-row prisoners have been exonerated in Florida, the most in the nation. In 21 of the 23 Florida exonerations for which the jury’s sentencing vote is known, judges imposed the death penalty by overriding a jury recommendation for life or following a non-unanimous jury recommendation for death. Florida now requires a unanimous jury recommendation before a judge can impose a death sentence.\n\nSources\n\nAndrew Pantazi, Jacksonville men freed 43 years after wrongful murder conviction, a first for a Florida conviction review unit, The Florida Times-Union, March 28, 2019.\n\nMike Schneider, Florida man and nephew who spent 42 years in prison cleared of murder, Associated Press, March 28, 2019.\n\nJim Piggott, Wrongly convicted of murder: 2 men freed after 42 years in prison, WJXT News4, Jacksonville, March 28, 2019.\n\nYear of Release: 2018 ⌃\n\nClemente Javier Aguirre\n\nFlorida — Conviction: 2006 , Charges Dismissed: 2018\n\nWith newly discovered confessions and DNA evidence pointing to the prosecution’s chief witness as the actual killer, Seminole County, Florida prosecutors dropped all charges against Honduran national Clemente Javier Aguirre. Aguirre was convicted and sentenced to death in 2006 of the murder of two neighbors—an elderly woman and her adult daughter—in 2004. He steadfastly maintained his innocence, saying he had discovered the women after they had been killed. He did not report the murders to authorities, he said, because he was an undocumented immigrant and feared deportation. The prosecution's chief witness against Aguirre was Samantha Williams, the mentally ill daughter and grand-daughter of the victims. During the post-conviction process, Aguirre's lawyers discovered that Williams had confessed to at least five different people that she had killed her relatives. None of the DNA found on the 84 items from the crime scene that were tested matched Aguirre. Most blood samples matched the two victims, and Samatha Williams's DNA was found on eight bloodstains collected from four different rooms—including in the bathroom where the state had argued at trial that the killer would have cleaned up. Each of Williams's samples was found inches away from the victims’ blood. On October 27, 2016, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously vacated Aguirre's conviction and granted him a new trial.\n\nAguirre was sentenced to death by the trial judge despite non-unanimous 7-5 and 9-3 jury votes for death in the two murders. 20 of the 22 Florida exonerations for which researchers have been able to determine the jury vote have involved judges imposing the death penalty despite a jury recommendation for life or after a non-unanimous jury recommendation for death.\n\nSources\n\nInnocent Man Who Spent Over a Decade on Florida’s Death Row is Exonerated, Innocence Project, November 5, 2018\n\nR.

A trial court in Kern County, California formally dismissed all charges against Benavides, a Mexican national, two days after Kern District Attorney Lisa Green said her office would not be seeking a retrial. The California Supreme Court had granted the former farmworker a new trial in March 2018, calling his convictions for sexually assaulting and murdering Consuelo Verdugo a product of “extensive,” “pervasive,” “impactful,” and “false” forensic testimony. The girl, the court said, had never been sexually assaulted and may actually have died from being hit by a car. At trial, the prosecution presented testimony that the toddler had died from “blunt force penetrating injury of the anus” caused by rape and multiple arm injuries, internal trauma, dilated pupils, and compression rib fractures “caused by tight squeezing during a sexual assault.” In post-conviction proceedings, Benavides’s lawyers presented evidence from a leading expert on child abuse characterizing the prosecution’s assertion that the child’s injuries had been the product of sexual assault as “so unlikely to the point of being absurd. … No such mechanism of injury has ever been reported in any literature of child abuse or child assault.” Rather, Dr. Astrid Heger said, the internal injuries the toddler sustained were commonly seen in victims of automobile accidents. Hospital records that were never presented at trial showed that the examining physicians from Consuelo’s initial hospitalization had not seen any signs of bleeding when she was brought to the emergency room, and a nurse who helped treat the child reported that neither she nor any of her colleagues had seen evidence of anal or vaginal trauma when the Consuelo arrived at the hospital. The medical records reflected that the injuries to Consuelo’s genitalia and anus that the prosecution expert had attributed to sexual assault were actually a product of unsuccessful medical intervention, including repeated failed efforts to insert a catheter and the improper use of an adult-sized catheter on the small child. During oral argument, Associate California Supreme Court Justice Carol Corrigan—a former prosecutor—described the forensic testimony that Benavides had brutally raped and anally sodomized Consuelo as “among the most hair-raising false evidence that I’ve encountered in all the time that I’ve been looking at criminal cases.”\n\nSources\n\nDeath row inmate Vicente Benavides released from custody Thursday after charges dismissed, The Bakersfield Californian, April 19, 2018\n\nJason Kotowski, Delano man whose murder conviction in death of 21-month-old girl was overturned last month will not be retried, April 17, 2018\n\nBakersfield Now Staff, Kern DA won’t retry overturned murder case, KMPH Fox 26, April 17, 2018\n\nCalifornia death row inmate to be freed; no retrial planned, Associated Press, April 17, 2018.\n\nYear of Release: 2017 ⌃\n\nRodricus Crawford\n\nLouisiana — Conviction: 2013 , Charges Dismissed: 2017\n\nThe Caddo Parish, Louisiana, District Court formally dismissed all charges against against Rodricus Crawford on April 17, 2017, exonerating him in a controversial death penalty case that had attracted national attention amid evidence of race discrimination, prosecutorial excess, and actual innocence. The Louisiana Supreme Court had ordered a new trial for Crawford in November 2016, finding that prosecutor Dale Cox had unconstitutionally struck black jurors on the basis of race. Crawford had been sentenced to death in 2012 on charges he had murdered his one-year-old son. Despite autopsy results that showed pervasive bronchopneumonia in the baby’s lungs and sepsis in his blood, the prosecution presented testimony from a local doctor who claimed the infant had been suffocated. After the trial, Crawford’s appeal lawyers obtained additional evidence from experts in the fields of pediatric pathology, pediatric neuropathology, and pediatric infectious disease that the child had died of natural causes. In dropping the charges against Crawford, James Stewart, who was elected Caddo Parish District Attorney in 2015, said, “New evidence presented after the trial raised questions about the degree of pneumonia together with bacteria in the child’s blood indicative of sepsis” required reconsideration of the charges against Crawford. A 2015 study documented pattern of racially biased jury selection by prosecutors in Caddo Parish, and data from 22 felony trials prosecuted by Cox showed he had struck black jurors at a rate 2.7 times higher than other jurors. Cox wrote an internal memo on the Crawford case in 2014 stating that Crawford “deserves as much physical suffering as it is humanly possible to endure before he dies” and attracted national criticism for questionable comments and practices, including telling The Shreveport Times that he believed the state needs to “kill more people.” Cox personally prosecuted 1/3 of all the cases in which Louisiana juries returned death sentences between 2010-2015. Ben Cohen, an attorney for Crawford, said, “This case has always been about injustice and the disproportionate use of the death penalty in Caddo Parish. In deciding not to retry Rodricus Crawford, the Caddo Parish District Attorney’s office is righting this injustice, restoring integrity to their office.”\n\nSources\n\nReview results in no retrial for Rodricus Crawford, KSLA News 12, April 14, 2017\n\nProsecutors won’t retry man in death of his son, Associated Press, April 15, 2017.\n\nGabriel Solache\n\nIllinois — Conviction: 2000 , Charges Dismissed: 2017\n\nFormer Illinois death-row prisoner Gabriel Solache, a Mexican national whose death sentence was one of 157 commuted by Governor George Ryan in January 2003, was exonerated on December 21, 2017 after twenty years of wrongful imprisonment, but immediately seized by agents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Cook County prosecutors dropped charges against Solache and his co-defendant Arturo DeLeon-Reyes after Circuit Court Judge James Obbish overturned their convictions, finding that disgraced Chicago detective Reynaldo Guevara had told “bald-faced lies” under oath when he testified to having no memory of interrogating Solache and DeLeon-Reyes and denied having beaten false confessions out of the men. Solache and DeLeon-Reyes were convicted in separate trials, and Solache was sentenced to death, for the 1998 stabbing deaths of Jacinta and Mariano Soto during a home robbery. No physical or biological evidence linked either man to the murder, but they were convicted based upon confessions they have long said were coerced by Guevara over the course of three days of interrogation in which they were denied their right to consular assistance by the Mexican government, deprived of sleep, and given little food or drink until they falsely implicated themselves. Solache’s purported confession was written entirely in English by an assistant state attorney who did not speak Spanish. Solache did not speak or read English and said that Guevara never translated the written statement for Solache before getting him to sign it. Guevera has been accused of framing defendants of murder in 51 cases. Judge Obbish wrote in his ruling, “The accounts of the unrelated incidents…are sufficiently similar to the accounts testified to by (Solache and DeLeon-Reyes) in that they all include threats, abuse and coercion to secure statements and occurred within a range of time so as to constitute a pattern and practice.”\n\nSources\n\nMike Hayes and Melissa Segura, Murder Convictions Overturned, Two Men Are Immediately Seized By ICE, BuzzFeed News, December 22, 2017\n\nMegan Crepeau, Prosecutors drop murder charges against 2 who allege cop beat them into confessing, Chicago Tribune, December 21, 2017\n\nMelissa Segura, Two More Guevara Defendants See Their Charges Dismissed, BuzzFeed News, December 21, 2017\n\nMelissa Segura, A Chicago cop is accused of framing 51 people for murder.

Newman\n\nArkansas — Conviction: 2002 , Charges Dismissed: 2017\n\nAn Arkansas trial judge dismissed all charges against former death-row prisoner, Rickey Dale Newman on October 11, 2017, after nearly 16 years in prison for the February 2001 murder of a transient woman in a “hobo park” on the outskirts of Van Buren, Arkansas. A former Marine with major depression, chronic posttraumatic stress disorder from childhood abuse, and an IQ in the intellectually disabled range, Newman was seriously mentally ill and homeless at the time he was charged with murdering Marie Cholette. After falsely confessing to interrogators, the court found him competent to stand trial and to represent himself. He was convicted and sentenced to death in June 2002 after a one-day trial in which Newman told the jury he had committed the murder and asked them to impose the death penalty. No physical evidence linked Newman to the murder and DNA evidence on the blanket on which the victim was found excluded Newman, but a prosecution expert falsely testified that hair found on Newman’s clothing had come from the victim. Newman subsequently sought to waive his appeals and be executed. However, four days before his scheduled execution on July 26, 2005, Newman permitted federal public defenders to seek a stay of execution and the lawyers obtained DNA testing of the hair evidence that disproved the prosecution’s trial testimony. They also discovered that prosecutors had withheld from the defense evidence from the murder scene that contradicted what Newman had described in his confession. A federal court hearing also provided evidence that the state’s mental health doctor had made significant errors in administering and scoring tests he had relied upon in testifying that Newman had been competent to stand trial.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court subsequently ordered new hearings on Newman’s competency and on the evidence the prosecution had withheld from the defense. After those hearings, it wrote that “the record overwhelmingly illustrates that Newman’s cognitive deficits and mental illnesses interfered with his ability to effectively and rationally assist counsel” and overturned his conviction. In September 2017, it issued another ruling barring the use of Newman’s incompetent confessions in any retrial. The prosecution then asked for the charges to be dismissed, noting that, without the false confession, prosecutors lacked sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction and “it would be a waste of tax payers money to retry [Newman].”\n\nSources\n\nD.

The court unanimously vacated Wright’s convictions for the murders of his ex-girlfriend and their son, ruling that the “purely circumstantial” evidence against him was insufficient to convict. A majority of the court joined a concurring opinion by Justice Charles Canady holding that “no rational trier of fact could have found … beyond a reasonable doubt” that Wright was the killer. Prosecutors accused Wright of murdering Paula O’Conner—a white woman with whom he had an affair—and their 15-month-old son Alijah supposedly to “avoid a child support obligation and … maintain a ‘bachelor lifestyle.’” The court noted that “none of the evidence presented at trial directly tied Wright to the murders” and that the victim’s young-adult daughter, who had a volatile relationship with the victim, also had a financial motive, having received more than $500,000 in life insurance benefits as a result of her mother’s and half-brother’s deaths. Much of the state’s case relied on the presence of a black military glove in the home of the murder victims. While Wright, a member of the Air Force, had access to that type of glove, “the State could not prove that Wright ever wore the glove, that he left it on Paula’s couch, that it came from MacDill [the base where Wright was stationed], or that it was even used in the murders.” DNA tests by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reported the results as inconclusive, but independent analysis by the DNA Diagnostic Center and Bode, the private labs hired by the defense and prosecution, respectively, excluded Wright as a contributor of the DNA found on the glove. The DNA analysis did not test for the presence of the victim’s daughter, whom police did not investigate. Wright was convicted of the murders, and the trial court sentenced him to death after a bare 7-5 majority of the jury voted to recommend the death penalty. The Florida Supreme Court later declared death sentences based upon non-unanimous jury recommendations to be unconstitutional. Wright is the 27th person to be exonerated from death row in Florida. Nineteen of the 21 exoneration cases from Florida in which the jury vote is known have involved a non-unanimous jury recommendation of a death sentence or a judicial override of a jury recommendation of life.\n\nSources\n\nB.

Young acquitted him of all charges in a retrial ordered by the Delaware Supreme Court. McCoy had been convicted and sentenced to death in 2012, but the Court overturned his conviction in 2015 as a result of prosecutorial misconduct in which the trial prosecutor, Deputy Attorney General R. David Favata belittled McCoy in front of the jury for choosing to represent himself, made intimidating comments to McCoy during a break in proceedings, then lied to the judge about having made those comments. McCoy waived his right to a jury for his retrial, but was represented by counsel. In acquitting McCoy, Judge Young noted that there was no physical evidence linking McCoy to the murder and that two alleged accomplices had given contradictory testimony. One of the accomplices, Deshaun White, received a sentence reduction for testifying against McCoy. Upon his release, McCoy said, “I just want to say to all those out there going through the same thing I’m going through ‘keep faith, keep fighting. Two years ago, I was on death row. At 25, I was given a death sentence – and I am today alive and well and kicking and a free man.” Favata was temporarily suspended from the practice of law as a result of his misconduct in the case.\n\nSources\n\nJ.

The trial judge imposed a death sentence for the conviction following a 7-5 vote by the jury to recommend death. No eyewitnesses placed Hodgkins in the vicinity at or around the time of the murder and the evidence against him was completely circumstantial. None of the 21 sets of fingerprints lifted from the crime scene belonged to Hodgkins and no evidence linked him to a bloody bottle found at the scene. Although his DNA was found in scrapings taken from underneath the victim’s fingernails, the Florida Supreme Court found that, even when viewed most favorably to the prosecution, this evidence “equally generates the theory” that Hodgkins’ DNA was present “through innocent contact.” The Court found that there were no defensive wounds on the victim’s body that would have suggested she had scratched her assailant, and that the closest Hodgkins had come to making any admissions about the murder was lying to police about the last time he had sexual contact with the victim, which he said he did because he did not want his wife to find out about his infidelity. Ultimately, the Court held that the evidence in the case was insufficient to convict and directed that the trial court enter a judgment of acquittal.\n\nSources\n\nHodgkins v.

(See Order of Nolle Prosequi, Wayne County, GA, Superior Court, June 8, 2015). In May 2008, the state superior court granted Lee a new trial, finding that prosecutors had engaged in a “full spectrum of prosecutorial misconduct,” accompanied by prejudicial investigative failures by his trial counsel. (Lee v. Terry, Butts County, GA, Superior Court, May 1, 2008). As described by the Superior Court, Lee was convicted and sentenced to death based upon “a weak prosecution case dependent for its success on the believability of two witnesses unfavored in the law and by the public – a jailhouse snitch and a co-conspirator – with absolutely no forensic evidence to link [him] to the crime scene.” The court found that the prosecution affirmatively misrepresented to the defense and the court that it had no exculpatory evidence in its files, while concealing evidence that contradicted the testimony or undermined the credibility of every one of its key witnesses. It also manipulated the trial proceedings by first denying the defense access to the physical evidence and then presenting evidence and argument it knew to be false that suggested Lee had been in possession of guns stolen from the victims’ home. The prosecution also concealed evidence that linked two other suspects to the murders and subsequently lost or destroyed 47 latent fingerprints and 15 unknown hairs recovered from the scene that did not match Lee, preventing Lee’s post-conviction lawyers from examining this exculpatory physical evidence to identify the actual perpetrators. In February 2015, the Superior Court barred the prosecution from presenting the prior testimony of two now-deceased witnesses, ruling that prosecutorial misconduct had prevented Lee from adequately cross-examining these witnesses at trial (see Order Concerning Admissibility of Evidence, Wayne County, GA, Superior Court, February 19, 2015), and leading to the decision to drop the charges against Lee.\n\nSources\n\nJudge Throws Out Conviction of Death Row Inmate, News4Jax, May 8, 2008.\n\nA.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals had overturned Brown’s conviction in 2014 because prosecutors withheld a phone record that supported Brown’s alibi. Prosecutors in 2013 said that the phone record had been inadvertently misplaced. Brown had long maintained that he had been alone at his girlfriend’s apartment at the time of the murder, and that he had called her after seeing reports of the shooting on television. Defense lawyers argued that the time of the phone call established that Brown could not have been at the store when the murder occurred. There was no physical evidence against Brown, and a series of Pulitzer prize-winning columns by Houston Chronicle writer Lisa Falkenberg disclosed irregularities in the grand jury process, that Brown’s girlfriend had faced intimidating questioning and threats of perjury by a police officer who was the grand jury foreman, and that she had been jailed for seven weeks until she changed her testimony to implicate Brown. In responding to a 2018 document request filed by Brown in a civil suit against Harris County, Harris County District Attorney, Kim Ogg—elected in 2016—disclosed an email from a Houston detective to Assistant District Attorney Dan Rizzo, the prosecutor in Brown’s case, alerting Rizzo that he had obtained the phone records from the morning of the murder in an attempt to refute the girlfriend’s grand jury testimony, but found that they supported her testimony and Brown’s alibi. Prosecutors nevertheless suppressed the records, jailed Brown’s girlfriend, and continued to prosecute him. Since 2007, Brown’s attorneys have compiled evidence that strongly suggests the murder was committed by another man who had both a history of robbery and connections to the co-defendants in the crime.

(See Order of Nolle Prosequi, Cir. Ct. Oktibbeha Cty. MS (April 20, 2015)). In February 2015, the Mississippi Supreme court granted Manning a new trial, saying that key evidence was withheld. (Manning v. State, en banc (Feb. 12, 2015)). Justice Michael K. Randolph wrote, “The State violated Manning’s due-process rights by failing to provide favorable, material evidence.” A witness testified that he saw Manning enter the victims’ apartment, but police records that were withheld from the defense show the apartment from which he claimed to have seen Manning was vacant at the time, and records from the apartment complex did not list the witness as a tenant. The witness later recanted his testimony, saying he feared he would be charged with the crime if he didn’t testify. Manning remains on death row for a separate crime, but the evidence against Manning in that case is hair and ballistics analysis from the FBI that was recently identified as seriously flawed. Manning came within hours of being executed in that case, receiving a stay of execution only after the FBI sent separate letters disclosing flaws in its ballistics and hair comparison testimony.\n\nSources\n\nR.

He was released on April 3, 2015. Hinton was convicted of the 1985 murders of two fast-food restaurant managers based upon the testimony of a state forensic examiner that the bullets in the two murders came from a gun found in Hinton’s house. The prosecutor, who had a documented history of racial bias, said he could tell Hinton was guilty and “evil” just by looking at him. Hinton was arrested after a victim in a similar crime identified him in a photo lineup, even though Hinton had been working in a locked warehouse 15 miles away when that crime was committed. Hinton’s lawyer did not know the law and mistakenly believed that funding to hire a qualified firearms expert was not available. Instead, he hired an expert he knew to be inadequate, and as a result failed to present any credible evidence to rebut the state’s claim that the bullets were fired from Hinton’s gun. In 2002, three top firearms examiners testified that the bullets could not be matched to Hinton’s gun, and may not have come from the a single gun at all. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that Hinton had been provided substandard representation and returned his case to the state courts for further proceedings. (HINTON V. ALABAMA, No. 13–6440 (2014)). Prosecutors decided not to retry him after the state’s new experts said they could not link the bullets to Hinton’s gun. (See State’s Motion for Order of Nolle Prosequi, Ala. v. Hinton, No. CC1985-3363, 10th Judic. Cir., Jefferson Cty. (Apr. 1, 2015)). Bryan Stevenson, Hinton’s lead attorney, said, “Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice. I can’t think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.”\n\nSources\n\nW.

Previously, on March 17, 2015 the Arizona Supreme Court denied a request by prosecutors that it review a lower court’s order that dismissed the charges against Debra Milke as a result of “egregious” police and prosecutorial misconduct and barring her retrial. The court’s decision effectively ends prosecutorial efforts to reinstate murder charges against Milke. Milke spent 23 years on death row for allegedly arranging for two men to kill her 4-year-old son so she could collect an insurance payout. The two men who were convicted of committing the killing remain on death row. In 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit overturned Milke’s conviction*because the prosecutor had withheld evidence that undermined key testimony in the case. (Milke v. Ryan, No. 07-99001). Arizona’s prosecutors have been *accused of misconduct in more than half of all cases in which the state has imposed death sentences. In this case, Detective Armando Saldate testified that Milke had confessed to him, but there was no recording, nor any witnesses to the confession, and Milke steadfastly denied having confessed. Saldate’s personnel record, which prosecutors withheld from the defense, revealed that the detective had committed serious misconduct in prior cases, including lying under oath. In December 2014, the Arizona Court of Appeals barred prosecutors from retrying Milke. The state sought to appeal that decision to the Arizona Supreme Court, which the court rejected on March 17, 2015. The trial court formally dismissed the charges on March 23, 2015, making Milke the 151st person exonerated from death row since 1973 and the first in 2015. She became the ninth person exonerated from death row in Arizona and the second female in the U.S.\n\nSources\n\nM.

Louisiana Judge Ramona Emanuel ordered Glenn Ford to be “unconditionally released from the custody of the Louisiana Department of Corrections” on March 11, 2014*. * Prosecutors said they had received “credible evidence” that Ford “was neither present at, nor a participant in, the robbery and murder” of which he was convicted in 1984. Ford, who has always maintained his innocence, was tried and sentenced to death by an all-white jury. One of the witnesses against him said at trial that police had helped her make up her story. A state “expert” who testified about the victim’s time of death had not even examined the body. Ford’s lead trial attorney had never tried a jury case before. A second attorney, two years out of law school, worked at an insurance defense firm. They failed to hire any experts to rebut the prosecution’s case because they believed they would have to pay for the experts themselves. The Louisiana Supreme Court earlier said it had “serious questions” about the outcome of the trial, but did not reverse Ford’s conviction. Ford may have been involved in trying to pawn jewelry from the victim that he received from one of the original codefendants.\n\n(A. Cohen, “After 30 Years on Death Row, an Innocent Man in Louisiana is About to Go Free,” The Atlantic, March 11, 2014. KTAL NBC News, Mar. 11, 2014).\n\n*UPDATE: *After Ford’s exoneration, the lead prosecutor on his case, A.M. “Marty” Stroud III, issued a public apology, expressing his belief in Ford’s complete innocence, saying, “There was no technicality here. Crafty lawyering did not secure the release of a criminal…Pursuant to the review and investigation of cold homicide cases, investigators uncovered evidence that exonerated Mr. Ford. Indeed, this evidence was so strong that had it been disclosed during of the investigation there would not have been sufficient evidence to even arrest Mr. Ford!”\n\n*UPDATE: *Ford died of cancer at age 65 on June 29, 2015.

Gross the same day.\n\nCarl Dausch\n\nFlorida — Conviction: 2011 , Acquitted: 2014\n\nOn June 12, the Supreme Court of Florida (6-1) overturned the convictions and death sentence of Carl Dausch because the state presented insufficient evidence of his guilt at trial. The Court directed that he be acquitted of all offenses, stating, “[T]he record lacks sufficient evidence of the perpetrator’s identity.” Dausch was convicted primarily on fingerprints and DNA from a cigarette butt that were found in the victim’s car. DNA evidence taken from the victim was less definitive. Dausch said he had hitchhiked while returning home from a family vacation, and the person who picked him up was likely the actual killer. Because the evidence against Dausch was circumstantial, the court applied a “special standard of review,” which required “that the circumstances lead ‘to a reasonable and moral certainty that the accused and no one else committed the offense charged. It is not sufficient that the facts create a strong probability of, and be consistent with, guilt. They must be inconsistent with innocence.” The Court said the evidence only linked Dausch to the victim’s car, not to the murder itself.\n\n(B. Farrington, “Supreme Court throws out conviction in ‘87 killing,” see Dausch v. Florida Associated Press, June 12, 2014\n\nNo. SC12-1161 (June 12, 2014), per curiam).\n\nDausch remains in prison in another state on unrelated charges.\n\nHenry McCollum\n\nNorth Carolina — Conviction: 1984 , Charges Dismissed: 2014\n\nThe two brothers who were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1984, were freed because of evidence uncovered by the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission. McCollum was 19 and Brown was 15 when they confessed to the rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie. Both men are intellectually disabled - McCollum has an IQ in the 60s and Brown has scored as low as 49 on IQ tests. McCollum and Brown have maintained their innocence since their trial, saying they were unaware they were signing a confession. “I’d never been under such pressure, people yelling and screaming at me,” McCollum said of his interrogation. “I was scared, and was just trying to get out of that police station and go home.” In 2010, Brown, who is now serving a life sentence for rape after his murder conviction was thrown out, contacted the Innocence Commission about his case. The Commission found DNA evidence near the crime scene belonging to another man, Roscoe Artis, who was sentenced to death for a crime similar to the one for which McCollum and Brown were sentenced to death. (Artis’ sentence was later reduced to life without parole.) On September 2, a Robeson County judge freed both men based on DNA evidence. (M. Biesecker “NC half brothers freed after 3 decades in prison,” News and Observer, September 3, 2014).\n\nUPDATE: On June 4, 2014, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory formally pardoned Brown and McCollum, thereby making them eligible for compensation related to their wrongful convictions.

Bridgeman once came within three weeks of execution, but his and Ajamu’s death sentences were struck down when Ohio’s death penalty was found unconstitutional in 1978.\n\nSources\n\n(M.

Ajamu joined his brother, Wiley Bridgeman, and co-defendant, Ricky Jackson, in being freed. He became the 151st death row exoneree since 1973. Upon his exoneration, Ajamu said, “The important part is that we have been united while we are standing forward and upward and that we are not looking at each other in the graveyard,” adding, “I feel vindicated. I feel free.” The three men are expected to file for compensation for their many years of wrongful imprisonment. Cuyahoga County prosecutors said they will not object to efforts to obtain compensation, saying that the men were “victims of a terrible injustice.” (J. Caniglia, “‘My battle is over!’ Judge throws out the 1975 murder conviction of Ronnie Bridgeman,” Cleveland Plain Dealer, December 9, 2014). Ajamu had been released from prison in 2003, but Jackson and Bridgeman spent 39 years in prison. Judge Richard McMonagle, who presided over the hearing considering the case, said, “Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.”\n\nRicky Jackson\n\nOhio — Conviction: 1975 , Charges Dismissed: 2014\n\nFormer death row inmate Ricky Jackson was exonerated on November 21 in Ohio, after spending 39 years in prison. A judge in Cleveland dismissed all charges against Jackson, with the prosecution in agreement. Jackson was one of three men convicted of the 1975 murder of Harold Franks. The other two defendants, Ronnie (now Kwame Ajamu) and Wiley Bridgeman, were also sentenced to death and have filed a petition for a new trial. Jackson’s death sentence was vacated earlier, and the Bridgeman brothers’ sentences were overturned when Ohio’s death penalty was found unconstitutional in 1978. The men were convicted on the testimony of a 12-year-old boy who later recanted his testimony, and who now has said he did not witness the crime at all. Several people confirmed the boy was on a school bus at the time of the crime. No other evidence linked the men to the murder. A gun and car seen at the crime scene were linked to a man who was arrested in 1978 for another murder, but he was never charged in Franks’ murder. In dropping the charges against Jackson, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said, “The state is conceding the obvious.” Ricky Jackson became the seventh person exonerated from death row in Ohio since 1973. Upon his release, Jackson said, “The English language doesn’t even fit what I’m feeling. I’m on an emotional high. You sit in prison for so long and think about this day but when it actually comes you don’t know what you’re going to do, you just want to do something.\n\nSources\n\n(K.

(Associated Press, “Ex-death row inmate exonerated in prison stabbing,” Oct. 30, 2013. Missouri’s Attorney General Chris Koster said it was “the appropriate and ethical decision at this time.”). Griffin had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow inmate in 1983. His conviction was overturned in 2011 by the Missouri Supreme Court (Griffin v. Denney, No. SC91112, Aug. 2, 2011) because the state had withheld critical evidence. Griffin’s conviction relied on the testimony of two jailhouse informants who received benefits in exchange for their testimony. Prosecutors withheld evidence that guards had confiscated a sharpened screwdriver from another inmate, Jeffrey Smith, immediately after the stabbing. Both of Griffin’s co-defendants consistently said the third person involved in the crime was Smith, not Griffin. Cyndy Short, the current lead attorney for Griffin, said, “Reggie and his family are overjoyed. This has been a massive weight upon them all for three decades.”\n\nIn overturning Griffin’s conviction, the Missouri Supreme Court said, “There is no physical evidence connecting Griffin to the weapon found in the gymnasium. There is no physical evidence demonstrating any contact between Griffin and Bausley. Instead, Griffin’s continued incarceration for Bausley’s murder is premised on the recanted testimony of inmate Curtis and the impeached testimony of deceased inmate Mozee. Overlaying the entire case is the revelation that the State failed to disclose evidence that tended to implicate Smith, impeach Curtis and Mozee, and bolster the trial testimony of inmate Rogers, who maintained that the inmate fleeing the crime scene was not Griffin.” (at 9).\n\nSee also DPIC’s Press Release.\n\nYear of Release: 2012 ⌃\n\nSeth Penalver\n\nFlorida — Conviction: 1999 , Acquitted: 2012\n\nOn December 21, Seth Penalver was acquitted of all charges and will be freed from Florida’s death row, 13 years after being sentenced to death. He was originally charged with a triple murder and armed robbery that occurred in Broward County in 1994. His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury. At his second trial in 1999, he was convicted and sentenced to death. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court (Penalver v. Florida, No. SC00-1602, Feb. 2, 2006) overturned his conviction because the prosecution had introduced improper evidence at his trial. A co-defendant, Pablo Ibar, was also sentenced to death and remains on death row. A video from the crime scene helped convict Ibar, but images showing another suspect were inconclusive. Penalver has always maintained his innocence. At Penalver’s most recent trial, which began 5 months ago, the jury was deadlocked 10-2, and both the prosecution and defense agreed to replace two jurors with alternates who had attended the proceedings. The newly constituted jury began deliberations afresh and found Penalver not guilty of all charges. Penalver is the 142nd person to be exonerated and freed from death row since 1973, and the 24th such person in Florida, the most of any state.\n\nSources\n\n(R.
