        "text": "French filmmaker Claude Lelouch (b. 1937) became a worldwide phenomenon in 1966 when his film “Un homme et une femme” (a.k.a. “A Man and a Woman”) hit the screens, and as a box office success, the film took home a long string of the most prestigious film awards, including the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for his screenplay. Mr. Lelouch was also nominated for an Oscar as ‘Best Director,’ only losing out to the always impeccable Fred Zinneman, who won for directing “A Man For All Seasons.”\n\n“Un homme et une femme” became a screen classic, and Francis Lai’s score (theme song) is one of the best-known ever made, even for those who never saw or even never heard of the film. Since then, Mr. Lelouch—who never had any ties with the French New Wave or any other movement, unlike many of his contemporaries—has always been a very productive filmmaker and recently finished his latest feature, “Les plus belles années d’une vie” (a.k.a. “The Most Beautiful Years of a Life”). The film is the second sequel to “Un homme et une femme,” after he did “Un homme et une femme, 20 ans déjà” (a.k.a. “A Man and a Woman: Twenty Years Later”) in 1986. Leading actors Jean-Louis Trintignant (now 88) and Anouk Aimée (87) reprise their roles as the former race driver and script girl in this third and final chapter of the trilogy, which was presented at the latest Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThis is how “Les plus belles années d’une vie” was received after its screening at the Cannes Film Festival\n\nMr. Lelouch was the guest of honor at the Brussels International Film Festival‘s closing night only a few weeks ago to promote the release of “Les plus belles années d’une vie” where we did the following group interview. As one of France’s most prominent film directors and the driving force behind Les Atelies du Cinéma, he’s still very ambitious and always eager to explore new territories in the world of filmmaking: his upcoming project “La vertu des impondérables” has even been shot with a cell phone.\n\nMr. Lelouch, how did the story of “Les plus belles années d’une vie” come about?\n\nAfter “Un homme et une femme,” I could never have imagined that this miracle could happen to me a second time. This film has changed my life, and the lives of everyone involved like Jean-Louis Trintignant or Francis Lai—and also the lives of the worldwide audience, which is estimated at approximately one billion people who have seen it in theaters and on television over the years. I always thought, ‘If the film is that successful, it probably has something substantial to say.’ So it seemed a good idea to come up with a final episode and come to a conclusion. I love life, and despite all its shortcomings which are much more photogénique, it interested me to make “Les plus belles années d’une vie” about a man and a woman who have lived their lives—they are able to talk about their lives and what they went through, and how well they understand a few of the things that happened to them over the years. They don’t understand everything, but the things they do understand are really important. I was very interested to see what the characters would be like today, how things are going now, or what they feel. I wanted to show that in the present, and even though they’re in their eighties, their lives can be very intense and passionate. There are no limits when it comes to loving someone; I wanted to show that love has no age—being in love is not a privilege for young people—and I thought this man and this woman are living the most precious moments of their lives. By being faithful to what happens in real life, I wanted it to be a very positive and upbeat film, and that’s what my life is all about right now. I’m in my eighties too, and those are the most beautiful years of my life. If I look back to my childhood… only now I’m having the time of my life. And I have no ego: if people don’t like my work, that’s fine with me while many years ago it used to hurt me. You must put everything into perspective and always look at the bright side of life; at least that’s what I do. I’m having more fun than I ever had before, I’ve been making a film with a cell phone, so there’s nothing that can stop me now. Ever since we are born, we all know life is an incredible journey that will end with a big mystery—people call it death, but to me, it’s all a big mystery. So while we’re still here, we need to make the most out of it. After all, who knows, maybe we’re all in for a big surprise.\n\nYou also wrote the screenplay of “Les plus belles années d’une vie.” Your actors are very spontaneous, so did they get the chance to read the script, or were they also allowed to improvise?\n\nI set out to make a spontaneous film, not a film with my actors playing their characters. If they had done that, the film would look like a prefabricated product, and that’s what I wanted to avoid at all times.\n\nAnd what about the dialogue you wrote?\n\nIt was all written on paper, but they didn’t get the chance to actually learn their lines. I told them what they were right before we started shooting, so they didn’t have the time to really learn them. They didn’t discover the importance of the words until they were saying them. That created a sort of spontaneity which is also one of the charms of the film. The scene when they first meet again, we shot that in forty minutes, including two rehearsals, and without interrupting the shoot. At their age, I think that a long shooting schedule would have cost a lot of energy, the actors would get tired and in the end, I wouldn’t get what I was looking for. So I preferred to work fast—we even shot the entire film in ten days. That’s what makes it so powerful, and I should know, because I’ve worked in films for over fifty years now, and I couldn’t have done this film when I was young. You really need the experience of a lifetime to make this film the way we did. But I was never sure; I mean I didn’t know if it would work out the way it did. We shot the opening scene on the first day, and we really worked day by day—Jean-Louis always said, ‘Who knows, maybe I will be dead by tomorrow morning.’\n\nWas it easy to convince Jean-Louis Trintignant et Anouk Aimée to reprise their roles?\n\nYes, it was easy because we share the same history, we are like oldtimers in this business, and we know our craft. We weren’t allowed to be really scared about what we were doing, and all three of us had agreed that the film wouldn’t be released if we thought it wouldn’t be good enough. We wouldn’t settle for less—even if it looked like an impossible film to make. But that didn’t necessarily make it impossible to try it, especially since we were convinced to do it. But everybody else was worried: the financers were very reluctant, and the assurance company didn’t want to back us. The film was one big risk, and because of that, it was passionate and interesting to do.\n\nWas it more difficult to do than the previous sequel “Un homme et une femme: 20 ans déjà”?\n\nWe made a mistake with that film. That film came much too soon; the characters didn’t come full circle with their lives. So whatever we did wrong back then, I think we were able to set the record straight with this one, particularly because it’s a film about time that has passed by. But those things happen. We all make mistakes. Life is an experience of joyful and dramatic events, highs and lows, and you have to live with that. I don’t ask myself that question too much—reporters do. I like to move on with my life and my career; I like to do things and make the films that are appealing to me, that’s what I would like to contribute. My films are like a chronique of the years that I’ve been fortunate to live. I always focused on stories of men and women who interested me more than others did. There are no real heroes nor villains in my films, but the characters could become heroes or villains one day. That paradox within human nature interests me because I like people; I like human beings with all their flaws—most importantly, our ego, which causes so much misery.\n\nAre there any actors that you regret you never worked with?\n\nJ’ai ratté Jean Gabin. I would have loved to have worked with him; he’s an actor I always admired. There are others too, but there’s no particular reason why we didn’t get to work together: it simply didn’t happen, and it’s very often a matter of coincidence whether a project is greenlighted or not.\n\nYour contribution to ‘Les Ateliers du Cinéma’ is very interesting. Is it important to pass on your experience as a filmmaker to the next generation?\n\nYes, and it’s something that both amuses me and interests me a lot. I don’t think you can learn how to make films; you have to do it. So I selected a number of people who are very passionate about cinema and I allow them to contribute in making a movie. They have no degree and no money, but they’re with me when I’m writing a script and when I’m shooting a film, they’re there every step along the way. Cinema is like love: you don’t learn it. No school tells you how to love someone like Marilyn Monroe, or Brigitte Bardot did. It’s the same with movies. Each one of us has to find his own way; you can’t invent a film director. So when they arrive on the set, they’re in control of the camera. It’s not like a film school; I only create an environment and give them the opportunity to make a film. This is a very rewarding experience; it’s like the most precious Oscar I could win.\n\nBehind the scenes of Les Ateliers du Cinéma\n\nSpeaking of the Oscars, how important was it for you to win an Academy Award?\n\nIt was a delight to win an Oscar and the Palme d’Or. Like decorations such as the Légion d’Honneur [the highest French order for military or civil merits], it’s very reassuring for others to know they believe in your work. In truth, I never understood why it took them so long to notice it.\n\nIn a career as long as yours, you also had a few films that didn’t work too well. What did you learn from them?\n\nThey taught me everything, I would never have been successful, and I wouldn’t be where I am now if it weren’t for the failures I made. We all suffer from time to time, and this learning experience could be tough—physically and psychologically—but it was inevitable. It’s very difficult to explain that to a young generation. I did about fifty films up until now, and every film was a learning experience. You learn every day. Also, with “La vertu des impondérables” that I shot with a cell phone, you have no idea what I learned. Your whole life is a learning experience, while a film school will tell you how others did it. You don’t have to teach an art student how to paint like Van Gogh or Picasso—nobody can do it any better than they did—but there are other ways to express yourself through painting, and you can learn a lot about that in life. My father was a very intelligent man because he realized pretty early that I was a terrible student, so he gave me a camera instead, and then I really began to live. The moment he gave me my first camera, I knew I had found the love of my life, and then I wanted to film everything I saw and share my observations with others. That was my ambition, but I know it didn’t always work that way.\n\nMusic is essential in your films. How did you collaborate with Calogero for the score of “Les plus belles années d’une vie”?\n\nHe was introduced to me by Francis Lai; he really adored Calogero. He had approached me previously for a project that didn’t work out, but we got to know each other, and I appreciated his music. When Francis was working on the theme of the film, he wanted someone to orchestrate, so we brought in Calogero, and he agreed to do it. His contribution to the film is tremendous. Music always goes straight to the heart, so it’s terribly important to have a great musical score in a film. In “La vertu des impondérables” there is also a lot of music.\n\nDo you have any idea how you will distribute that film?\n\nI hope it will be theatrically released, just to prove what this tiny device is capable of. The film is in post-production now. I’ve shown some footage to people from the industry who thought it was done with a 35mm camera. For the distributers, it won’t make a difference what camera was used, but it was more challenging to convince crew members to participate.\n\nWould you consider Netflix too? Is that an option?\n\nI don’t think it’s a good idea to throw away la grande aventure du cinéma. You should see a film on a big screen. When you watch it on television, there’s so much screen magic that gets lost. So simply for the sake of the cinema experience, I will continue to make feature films. Don’t misunderstand me; television is great for series, and it’s a great alternative for people who really don’t care that much to experience a film on a big screen.\n\nBrussels International Film Festival, Brussels\n\nJune 28, 2019\n\n“Les plus belles années d’une vie” (2019, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nLE PROPRE DE L’HOMME (1961) DIR – SCR – CAMERA OPERATOR Claude Lelouch PROD Pierre Braunberger CAST Amidou, Janine Magnan\n\nLA FEMME SPECTACLE, a.k.a.
