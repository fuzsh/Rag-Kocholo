        "text": "Marco Arop, the reigning world 800-metre champion, will run for his first Olympic gold medal on Saturday.\n\nThe Edmonton athlete won his semifinal heat in one minute 45.05 seconds on Friday to qualify for Saturday's final (1:05 p.m. ET, CBC Gem, CBC Olympics app) at Stade de France, where he'll aim for Canada's first podium finish in the event since Bill Crothers, who took silver at the 1964 Tokyo Games.\n\nArop beat Frenchman Gabriel Tual by 11-100ths in the second of three heats and qualified eighth overall.\n\n\"Staying composed, stay controlled and be ready for that final kick. I think I executed well today,\" Arop told Devin Heroux of CBC Sports.\n\nHe looks to win Canada's first Olympic medal in the event since Bill Crothers earned silver at the 1964 Tokyo Games.\n\nArop positioned himself at the back of the pack early on but took the lead at the start of the final 400-metre lap. He was in a battle for first with South Africa's Edmund du Plessis until the final 100 when he slowly pulled away. About 25 metres to finish line, he glanced to his right at Tual, who was charging late but couldn't catch the Canadian.\n\n\"That was brilliant by Marco Arop. He controlled the race, he was patient, made his tactics clear and was confident,\" said CBC Sports analyst Dave Moorcroft. \"When we saw him coming down the straight he looked relaxed.\n\n\"Tual is one of the fastest in the world … but Marco was the class act in that race. With du Plessis on his shoulder, [he was] not panicking, biding his time. You're making massive decisions in the most important part of the race and [Arop] did that brilliantly.\"\n\nWATCH | Arop grabs last spot for 8-man, 800m final:\n\nLast September, Arop's coach Chris Woods told CBC Sports it would be deemed a success for the middle-distance runner if he made the Olympic final in Paris.\n\n\"He's a world champion but not yet an Olympic finalist,\" Woods said, \"so that's the goal, and then we can focus on medals and winning.\"\n\nKenya's Emmanuel Wanyonyi was tops in qualifying Friday, leading a fast third heat in 1:43.32.\n\nFive of the eight runners finished under 1:44 while none of the 16 athletes across the first two heats dipped under 1:45.\n\nArop won the 2023 world championship title in a Canadian record 1:42.85 and has a 1:42.93 season best.\n\nAlgeria's Djamel Sedjati will also be one to watch in the final after he won Friday's opening heat in 1:45.08. On July 12, he clocked a world-leading 1:41.46 at the Monaco Diamond League meet five days after going 1:41.56 at the Meeting de Paris.\n\n'I'm not sure how I'm going to feel tomorrow'\n\nThe goal until Saturday's final is to have a good recovery from the semifinal, Arop pointed out.\n\n\"l'm not sure how I'm going to feel tomorrow,\" he said, \"but I'm confident that I'll have what it takes to get the job done.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old didn't get the job done at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nArop placed seventh (1:44.90) in his semifinal, 16-100ths behind Kenya's Emmanuel Korir, the final qualifier for the final. The Canadian placed 14th overall in a field of 24.\n\nArop didn't feel well during warmup and his stomach \"felt heavy\" after he ate a banana about three hours earlier, but the middle-distance runner didn't share this information with Woods or members of his support staff.\n\n\"I wasn't feeling the best going into the race,\" Arop told CBC Sports last year. \"I had a great heat [the previous day winning in 1:45.26] and thought if I approached [the semifinal] the same way and everything felt the same, I would be in the final, so I was fairly confident.\"\n\nWeakened late in 2021 Olympic semifinal\n\nBut Arop admitted not having the confidence to change his racing style minutes before the race.\n\nHe managed to hold off Australia's Peter Bol after the latter made a move around the 500-metre mark but Arop weakened once he reached the straightaway with about 80 metres to the finish.\n\nAfter the race, it was an instant lesson learned.\n\n\"No matter how I'm feeling,\" Arop began, \"I have to assess the situation and choose what race plan is best. The way I felt [before the 2021 Olympic semifinals] and thinking I had to force that race strategy [of leading start to finish] was the worst combination.\"\n\nArop is feeling much better about his approach to Saturday's final.\n\n\"I'm in a completely different [mental] state from three years ago [in Tokyo] and it's showing in the races I've run,\" he said.\n\n\"[I'm] keeping my confidence high going into the final and I'm just grateful for it all, really.\"\n\nCanadian women finish 6th in 400xm relay\n\nLater on Friday, the Canadian women's 4x100m relay team finished sixth.\n\nSade McCreath, Jacqueline Madogo, Marie-Eloise Leclair and Audrey Leduc ran a time of 42.69 seconds.\n\n\"I think we're growing as a team, we're all really young,\" Madogo said. \"This is all of our first Olympics and I think the girls were building a great chemistry and great friendship on and off the track. This is not the last time you'll see the women's 4x100 in a major final.\n\n\"Until next time, we're definitely gonna put Canada on the map on the women's side.\"\n\nThe U.S. won the gold medal in the Olympic women's 4x100 meters relay on Friday, their 12th title in the event, after Britain botched their final exchange.\n\nThe U.S. team of Melissa Jefferson, Twanisha Terry, Paris Olympic 200m champion Gabby Thomas and Sha'Carri Richardson clocked 41.78 seconds after getting the baton around the track with no major mishaps. Britain were not so lucky.\n\nLeading the U.S. through three legs, Amy Hunt struggled to get the baton into Daryll Neita's hand in pouring rain at Stade de France. Neita lost all her momentum, but still brought Britain home in 41.85 for silver. Germany claimed bronze in 41.97.\n\nCanada last earned a medal in the women's event at the 1984 Los Angeles Games with the team of Angela Bailey, Angella Issajenko, France Gareau and Marita Payne.\n\nCanada 8th in women's 400m relay qualifying\n\nA 51-second performance in the third leg by Lauren Gale lifted the Canadian women's 4x400-metre relay team to Saturday's final at 3:14 p.m..\n\nTeammate Kyra Constantine was passed by Sharlene Mawdsley of Ireland down the straightaway of the anchor leg but Canada qualified eighth for the eight-team final with its time of three minutes 25.77 seconds.\n\nThe top three teams from each of the two heats advanced with the next two fastest, Belgium (3:24.92) and Canada, which beat Italy by 73-100ths of a second for the final spot. The United States, in a 3:21.44 season best, had the fastest time.\n\nOnly 1.05 seconds separated the seven other qualifying teams.\n\n\"We're a fighting team,\" Zoe Sherar, who ran a 51.90 opening leg for Canada, told Devin Heroux of CBC Sports. \"We know when we step on the [start] line together we have each other's backs … so I think we can be excited for tomorrow.\"\n\nWATCH | Gale leads Canada's women to 4x400 relay final:\n\nCanada was fifth early in Gale's run but the Ottawa native, with a 50.47 personal best this season in the individual 400, had moved into third spot when she handed the baton to Constantine, who battled over the final 200 metres to achieve the necessary time to help the Canadians advance.\n\nAiyanna Stiverne of Laval, Que., clocked 51.70 in the second leg.\n\n\"It took me three times to get [to the Olympics]. I'm really, really excited to be here with the girls,\" said the 29-year-old Stiverne, who captured 2019 silver in the mixed 4x400 event at World Relays. \"Anybody we put on the track is going to do amazing and I have complete faith in every single one of them.\"\n\nHistorically, Canada has fared well in the event on the world stage but not good enough to medal, placing fourth at each of the past two Olympics and World Athletics Championships.\n\nAbdul-Rashid 'happy' with hurdles PB\n\nElsewhere, Mariam Abdul-Rashid made a valiant attempt to qualify for the final in women's 100m hurdles, clocking a 12.60-second PB, but finished 11th and 16-100ths shy of Frenchwoman Cyrena Samba-Mayela for the eighth and final spot.\n\n\"I'm happy to leave with a personal best but that's not what I came for,\" she said.\n\nOn Aug. 27, 2003, Perdita Felicien won a world title for Canada in 12.53 at Stade de France. She wrote a note of encouragement to Abdu-Rashid in Paris\n\n\"I'm really lucky to have had people to look up to in Canadian women's hurdles, but there's some work to do if I want to stand on the same level that they're at. [I'll] go back to the drawing board and figure it out.\"\n\nAbdul-Rashid, from Oshawa, Ont., qualified 14th for Friday's semifinals with a 12.80 effort in her first Olympic race.\n\nIn late April, the 26-year-old set a then-12.69 PB to meet the 12.77 automatic Olympic entry standard.\n\n16-year-old helps U.S. to men's relay final\n\nAmerican teenage sprinter Quincy Wilson's first run at the Olympics on Friday was a learning lesson.\n\nThe 16-year-old, who became the youngest American male to compete in track at the Olympics, left the United States in a distant seventh place after his opening lap in the first round of the 4x400 relay.\n\nThe Americans, normally dominant in this event, needed a rally from Christopher Bailey on the final lap simply to qualify for the final. The team finished third in 2:59.15.\n\nThere was a nearly three-second gap between Wilson and Letsile Tebogo, the 200m champion from Botswana who was a last-minute replacement. Wilson was picked up by veteran teammates Vernon Norwood, Bryce Deadmon and Bailey.\n\n\"I wasn't 100 per cent myself, but my team came out here and did it for me,\" Wilson said. \"I knew I had a great three legs behind me and knew it wasn't just myself. Because if it was myself we'd be in last place. But these guys come out there and gave it their all. ... They ran their hearts out.\"\n\nIt's been quite a summer for Wilson, who already has a name, image and likeness deal with New Balance and put off getting his driver's licence so he could run in Paris.\n\nHe twice broke the under-18 400-meter world record at the U.S. Olympic trials in June with times of 44.66 and 44.59.\n\nWith his performance Friday, Wilson surpassed Arthur Newton, a steeplechase runner from 1904 who competed at 17, according to Olympic historian Bill Mallon."
