        "text": "You may not be too familiar with her name, but for the past four decades, Los Angeles-born Valorie Massalas has been one of the city’s most prominent and prolific casting directors. She launched the career of Kiefer Sutherland after his arrival in Hollywood in the early 1980s, and she cast Sharon Stone in Paul Verhoeven’s “Total Recall” (1990), which ultimately led to “Basic Instinct” two years later. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, as we’ve all seen the work of Ms. Massalas over the years. She worked with film directors such as Steven Spielberg, Richard Attenborough, Randal Kleiser, Paul Verhoeven, Robert Zemeckis, Rob Marshall, Richard Donner, Garry Marshall and Bill Condon, and she has cast numerous wonderful actors in award-winning performances.\n\nMs. Massalas also cast and co-produced “Gods and Monsters” (1998), nominated for three Academy Awards, including Ian McKellan for best actor, Lynn Redgrave for best supporting actress and Bill Condon, who won for his screenplay.\n\nThe trailer of Bill Condon’s “Gods and Monsters” starring Ian McKellen as film director James Whale, with Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave in other leading roles.\n\nFor “Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story” (1995, produced by Glenn Close and Barbra Streisand), Ms. Massalas was awarded the Artios Award, the highest honor of the Casting Society of America for excellence in casting. The CSA also nominated her for Best Casting for TV Movie of the Week for “Cinderella” (1997), starring Whitney Houston, and for Rob Marshall’s “Annie” (1999). During last year’s Los Angeles Greek Film Festival, which was dominated by female filmmakers and female-driven stories, she received the Honorary Orpheus Award at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nHer latest films include “About Last Night” (2014), starring Kevin Hart and Regina Hall, which grossed nearly 50 million dollars in the U.S. alone.\n\nAfter being introduced to her by film director Randal Kleiser, I had the honor and the opportunity to talk to Ms. Massalas about her work as a casting director.\n\nMs. Massalas, can you tell me how you got started in this business?\n\nMy first job was being a secretary at an agency, and I had an opportunity to see that side of the business—selling actors, submitting actors—and then I got to work in a casting office. Back then, there were very few high-end casting directors, one of them was a company called Fenton & Feinberg, with Mike Fenton and Jane Feinberg. I was lucky enough to get hired by them. Their first movies were “American Graffiti” [1972], “The Godfather, Part II” [1974], “Chinatown” [1974], “Shampoo” [1975], “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” [1975], “Marathon Man” [1976]. When I met them, they were doing “Norma Rae” [1979], and they had a map of Alabama on the wall. I started working for them, and “Breaking Away” [1979] was my first movie. That took me to New York to cast the movie for Peter Yates, and then I became Jane Feinberg’s assistant, and eventually I became a casting director. I stayed with that company for fifteen years, that was a fantastic experience. The best casting people in town have mentored me. I was extremely lucky and very grateful for the fifteen years I got to spend with them because I worked on “Back to the Future” films, two “Indiana Jones” films, and I did “Amazing Stories” for Spielberg… I had an office on the Amblin lot for quite a while. After I left in 1992, I produced a movie, “Gods and Monsters” [1998], that got three nominations at the Oscars, and it was director’s Bill Condon break-through hit. He got nominated, and he won an Oscar for writing the script. Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave also got nominated. When I went to the Oscars, I was there as a part of that movie. It’s a whole different experience. You’re in the game, and you spend the rest of your career trying to get back on that red carpet with a movie that you are also nominated for, which is not an easy thing to do. Then I had a very tragic illness—I was in the hospital for six months, three months in a coma, and three months in rehab. It just blew me off the map. Shortly after I came out of the hospital, 9/11 happened, so the whole world went into shock and in sort of shutdown. While everything was kind of healing, the business was also changing. My brass ring sort of passed me by, and it took a while to build up my momentum. But I was very fortunate. I had great relationships with people that supported me and gave me work. I was out on my own and got a partner in 2005 [Ron Digman], and we were together for ten years. In 2015 we decided to go our separate ways, and so here I am. I’m still in the business, and I still have projects, but it’s harder now because independent features are not as they used to be. It’s getting more difficult now to get money and have a project financed.\n\nYou spent quite a bit of time working for Steven Spielberg. Did that help you career-wise?\n\nYes, you get your foot in the door, and people recognize you. So I’m very grateful for the years that I spent with Mike and Jane, and the years they worked for Steven because I was able to participate in that as well. I will always be grateful for that.\n\nWhat makes him so unique?\n\nWhen I worked for him, he was the guy; he was it. He’s got a standard and a reputation. If you picked up the phone and asked an agency to send a picture of a client, they would say, ‘Well, you know…’ But if you told them you worked for Spielberg, it would be hand-delivered to you in an hour. That’s how it worked. When Spielberg wanted something, he got it. And everybody wanted to work for him, so it was such a great privilege if you could say, ‘I’m working on a Spielberg movie.’ And he’s such a great guy, he’s a lot of fun, he’s a big boy—you give him a toy and he’s happy [laughs.] He wanted every new gadget and every new thing he could get his hands on. He was great to work for. There is only one Spielberg; you can’t duplicate him.\n\nIs there anything in particular that you learned from him?\n\nBecause he had such a creative vision of everything he did—he was involved on every level—it was never no, but how. So when I had an assistant who said, ‘Oh, I can’t find this number,’ and he stopped looking—no, you keep looking till you find it. The number is there; you just haven’t found it. Your job isn’t done until you find that number. I learned that watching how Spielberg navigated on the set: how can we make this work? He would consult with the best of the best until somebody came to him with a solution because he wasn’t going to compromise. That’s what he did, and that’s what makes him so unique. A great mentor and a great example of that principle alone. People tend to box themselves in, like ‘this is my job, this is what I have to do,’ but with Spielberg, you don’t have a job title. Whatever your work is, whatever you can contribute, whatever you can participate, he’s open to it. That’s also part of his approach, not limiting people.\n\nHow many years did you work for him?\n\nFrom the early eighties until about 1985 or 1986. Those were very crucial years when we also did “Poltergeist” [1982] and all the films he produced and that came out of his production company. When you work on that level, the whole town is asking you, ‘Oh please, you should meet so and so.’ They can’t present you their people enough. When you’re not on that level, you try to get people in the door because you try to talk them into great opportunities. But working for Spielberg, you don’t have to talk anybody into anything: you get to do what you do very well because people are very supportive.\n\nHow do you work as a casting director? Do you start with the screenplay, or meeting the director?\n\nI think casting never stops. I’m always casting; it just never stops. Wherever I am, I’m looking at someone I’ve never seen before, I’m watching the interaction, I’m observing the behavior, I’m accutely aware that it’s possible to find talent pretty much anywhere. And now—I can’t say that I’m crazy about this concept—when you walk in the door, the first thing they’ll ask you is, ‘How many followers do you have?’ Sadly, they will respond to people who are not even actors because they have many followers. If they put someone in an acting role, those followers will buy the tickets. While people who have been working on their craft for five, six, or ten years and hope to get a part don’t get it because they don’t have those followers. That’s a part of the business that I don’t enjoy because to me, it is an organic experience: I don’t have to read an actor to decide if there is something interesting about him. It’s not about the reading that interests me; it’s about whatever energy, personality, and exchange. So now you hear people saying, ‘We have a session where we have all the actors put themselves on tape and send in the tapes, and then we’ll pick the ones we like to bring them in.’ Okay, but you’re missing the whole point: you’re not sitting down with an actor and taking five minutes to shake his hand, look him into the eye, see who you’re talking to, and feel what’s going on. Because if you do that, you experience what you’re doing, and the actor gets to experience it too. So when I was sitting at my desk at Mike Fenton and Jane Feinberg, my number one goal was to meet every single person I could get in the room because I understood early on that I was the president of my own company and that every hand I shook and every person I met, would somewhere down the line read for me or get a call from me. I wanted this professional relationship with as many people as possible. I’m so grateful I did that because I met so many wonderful people. When we went to those big casting director luncheons where they would get awards, I would say to my employees, ‘Don’t sit at the table with everybody you work with every day. Get up and talk to the people you talk to on the phone and that you don’t know. Introduce yourself, make sure they know who you are, see them, recognize them, go back every year and build that network. Don’t just cling to the people you know. You have to mingle.’ And that’s what this business is all about. Back then, we did it in person; now everybody does it on social media. People now often work together, and they don’t even know what they look like. I want to see, I want to know, I want to have lunch and communicate with somebody that I know. That’s invaluable.\n\nWhen an actor reads for you, is there anything in particular that you pay attention to?\n\nYou use your instincts, of course. But what I’m most particularly aware of, is, did they do their homework? Did they come to me prepared? Do they recognize that this is a big opportunity, and did they take advantage of whatever time they had before they walked in the door? Did they use excuses like, ‘My printer wasn’t working,’ excuses that are just sabotaging themselves. I have a theory: you can’t hide behind your finger. So when someone uses an excuse like, ‘Oh, my printer broke down,’ I don’t need to know that. Just make me feel that you worked really hard to make it work. They don’t realize they reveal their insecurity by what they say. So I would ask them, ‘How prepared are you? Did you do your homework?’ They have to read the material, become the material, do it in many different ways… A friend of mine is an actor, and when he has an audition the next day, he won’t go out, he won’t use his phone, he won’t drink, he won’t do anything that interrupts the flow of being clear, of walking through that door and having clarity. That is dedication, and you can bring that to the table. That makes you stand out; you bring it with you when you walk in the door. We can feel that, we’re hypersensitive people, that’s why we’re here.\n\nYou are a crucial link between the actor and the film director, aren’t you?\n\nYes.\n\nHow do you work with your directors? Do you have a specific working method?\n\nIt’s always different because every director has a different way of handling it. Some directors don’t relate to actors; they’re not about the actors. They’re about, ‘this is my scene.’ You can have directors who know exactly what they want, and they always make the right choices. That only happens now and then—like Bill Condon. When we did “Gods and Monsters,” every choice he made was perfect. When I look at that movie, I can’t see one mistake. And it’s very difficult to make a movie when you cast people you don’t actually see. We knew Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester; we knew the characters in the movie, but Bill had a very precise vision of what he wanted. It doesn’t surprise me that he became such an excellent writer and director. He made the right choices, and a director who can’t do that, his movies are usually not that great because casting is very crucial, and bad choices can hurt you. It’s that simple.\n\nWillaim Friedkin once said to me that casting is ninety percent of the movie. Would you agree with that?\n\nYes, I have to agree. If you do a great casting job, half of the work is done because the actors are going to do all the hard work. They will bring it to you. From a director’s point of view, I don’t envy them because they see so many people, and everybody brings in a different perspective. And then of course, nowadays, honestly, I don’t know if too many people think about chemistry. I don’t think they realize that chemistry is very important. Because if people find that magic, again, half your job is done. The kind of chemistry that Katharine Hepburn had with Spencer Tracy or Vivien Leigh with Clark Gable.\n\nYou’re already aware of that chemistry when you’re at work in the casting office?\n\nOh yes. We would have chemistry readings, we would choose the people—three or four girls for the part, and three or four guys for the part, and then we would mix a match, have them read with each other, and see who had the magic.\n\nDo you make the final decisions on your own?\n\nNo, the director does. Tthere are always many people in the room. You’d have the director, the producer, the casting people—a very opinionated group, but the director makes the final decision.\n\nDid it ever happen to you that an actor came in and you immediately knew he was right for the part, so he even didn’t have to read?\n\nThat can happen if you already know the person, so you’d ask questions—it would be set up as a meet and greet. It would be prearranged, there’s no reading; we just want to make sure that you like me, I like you, and we have the same mindset. But in that case, the director has already decided that he wants that particular actor for the part.\n\nWere you ever disappointed that things didn’t work out the way you hoped they would?\n\nYes. Sometimes you remember the people you didn’t get to cast more than the ones you did. When we did “Triumph of the Spirit” [1989], I fought for Julia Roberts, and she really wanted that part. The only reason she didn’t get it, is because she didn’t want to shave her head. So the producers took an unknown actress instead that nobody has ever heard of since—a lovely girl, but she didn’t become Julia Roberts.\n\nOnce you have done your casting, do you stay with the project and stay in touch with the director, actors, cinematographer,…?\n\nThat would be nice, but in those days, when I was doing three or four projects at a time, I didn’t have the luxury of going to the set, becoming friends, or hanging out. Sometimes I’d be on the set, but that happened very rarely. But as a casting director, your work is not on the set, it’s before they go into production: your work is done when they go into production.\n\nWhen Stephen Frears was casting “Dirty Pretty Things” [2002], he only wanted to ‘cast faces, not acting abilities to speak the language.’ So he looked at Audrey Tautou’s photograph, and he knew that her face was perfect for that character, even though she didn’t speak any English. All her lines were written down phonetically and she learned them phonetically.\n\nThat was a great film, and she was great in it. And she definitely has that face, especially if you look at “Amelia” [2001, a.k.a. “Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain,” nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign-Language Film]. That film really launched her face; she had like an Audrey Hepburn face. You couldn’t take your eyes off her, and she was in every frame of the movie. I think the director must have had a crush on her [laughs].\n\nSanta Monica, California\n\nMarch 29, 2019\n\nFILMS [AS CASTING DIRECTOR]\n\nPARTNERS (1985) DIR James Burrows PROD Aaron Russo SCR Francis Veber CAM Victor J.
