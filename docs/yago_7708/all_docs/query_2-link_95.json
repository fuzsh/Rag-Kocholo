The one under the tag and another one for sure, and three or four others I'm sure I recognise, but can't place.\n\nPost by Tommen_Saperstein on\n\ngod Spooktober can't come soon enough. I used to not even like horror but now it's one of my favorite times of the year\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\nugh I can't believe this is only a month away. I'm excited but where the hell did July and August go?\n\nI feel ya, man. I love summer so much, but the only solace I get is that fall is also awesome.\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\n31 Days of Horror: Some of the Best Underseen Freaky Films to Get You in the Mood for Halloween.\n\nDay 1: A Blade in the Dark / La casa con la scala nel buio (1983, Lamberto Bava)\n\nWhen the lights go out, the knife goes in! Tasked with composing a score for an upcoming horror film, a musician (Andrea Occhipinti) finds himself stalked by a killer while staying in a Tuscan villa. Originally planned as a miniseries, television censors deemed it too gory but instead of cutting out the kills, it was re-edited as a film and released to theaters. The follow-up to Bava’s 1980 debut Macabre, there is plenty for horror buffs to appreciate between the cold open, the creepy killer, and inventive use of film tape. Most notable is the unnerving score that suitably plays a large role.\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\nDay 2: Luz (2019, Tilman Singer)\n\nTilman Singer’s love letter to 1980s European horror covers the strange aftermath of a car accident involving the title character (Luana Velis) and an ancient demon. Perfectly evoking the aesthetic of the era down to the cinematography and fantastic synth score, this is a confidently crafted and bizarrely entertaining story of possession. Having fun with chronological storytelling, minimalistic set pieces and sound design, Luz is a creative, off-the-wall and effective trip worth taking. In addition to writing/producing/editing this film, this is also Singer’s directorial debut, making this is a promising start to what is hopefully a long career in the genre.\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\nDay 3: Supernatural (1933, Victor Halperin)\n\nA deliciously bonkers pre-Hays Code flick, Supernatural tells the story of a woman (Carole Lombard) who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently executed serial “black widow” murderess. The only horror film on the résumés of both Lombard and her co-star Randolph Scott, this contains what must be the record for the most maniacal laughter ever heard on screen. The follow-up to director Halperin’s 1932 film White Zombie, this revenge tale is as silly as it is entertaining.\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\nDay 4: The Fan (1981, Ed Bianchi)\n\nLauren Bacall stars as an aging actress balancing a comeback, a very involved ex-husband, and a monotone stalker in this controversial, skeevy, and entertaining slasher. With a strong cast that never phones it in, The Fan co-stars Michael Biehn, James Garner, Maureen Stapleton and Hector Elizondo. This was also the directorial debut of Ed Bianchi who would go on to great success in television directing episodes of Homicide, The Wire, Boardwalk Empire and Deadwood. At times reminiscent of All That Jazz (with switchblade violence thrown in), composer Pino Donaggio provides a strong main theme to this psychosexual thriller.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nI'm a fan of The Fan! Love the macro-lensed opening credits, and with the Pino score? Liable to make one think of De Palma. Off to a good start, and it has such a great, classy cast around a meh Biehn... idk if Bacall, Garner or Stapleton ever made another horror? Speaking of Stapleton, as the long-time assistant she gives such a suddenly and deeply felt perf... one of my hot takes, I prefer it over her Reds perf from the same year.\n\nParamount had trouble with the movie off the bat, and pulled back publicity bc it was being tied to John Lennon's murder - so much so there were specific disclaimers before the previews. Spooky fact: Lennon was killed in front of his apt building.... another resident of the building: Bacall.\n\nLast thing, love this shot from the movie :\n\nPost by cheesecake on\n\nI'm a fan of The Fan!

Amazing shot as well."
