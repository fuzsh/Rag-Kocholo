        "text": "In the province of Quebec (Canada) like in many other secular settings, the visibility of the religious practices of newcomers as well as their claims for public recognition triggered lively debates that dramatically shifted the issue of secularity in the realm of public controversy, social tensions and possible fragmentations. First, in 2007 to 2008, a controversy followed the implementation of a Canadian federal legal measure known as 'reasonable accommodation' that aimed at facilitating accommodation of the religious practices of minorities in public spaces, namely in the workplace and in schools. In the aftermath of lively public debates on the social desirability and acceptability of such accommodations, the Quebecois government commissioned two experts (Charles Taylor, a philosopher, and Gérard Bouchard, a sociologist) to launch a large public reflection over the role and conditions of the integration of religious minorities into the local cultural and social landscape. Among others, the commissioners recommended state intervention with a ban on the wearing of obvious religious signs for civil servants or representatives of the state, including kindergarten educators. The Liberal government never legislated in this regard, either for lack of interest in societal issues or for lack of time before it lost power, or for both, thereby neglecting collective concerns over the definition of Quebecois identity and the possible role Catholicism may occupy in this setting. Some commentators proposed that the commission aimed more at cooling down the public turmoil caused by the push for reasonable accommodations than it did at setting up a legal framework to delineate minorities' claims. Indeed, the commission gave the public the opportunity to express their feelings over the presence of minority groups but did no more than witness the expressions of fears, resentments and hostilities emerging from local individuals as well as from civil actors with respect to religiously and culturally diverse populations henceforth present in the province. In 2012, four years after the Bouchard-Taylor commission, the Parti Québécois, whose agenda draws primarily on provincial sovereignty, won the provincial election partly by resurrecting collective mobilization over issues of national identity. This programme reached its climax when the government proposed the adoption of a Charter of Values (Charte des valeurs) that was explicitly designed and presented as a 7\n\nIn the struggle to establish an operative model of secularism in Quebec, the meaning and purpose of religious symbols has become a subject of an intense and divisive debate. Quebec's uneasy relationship with its Catholic heritage, coupled with increasing concerns over religious extremism and transnational terrorism have contributed to widespread mistrust of overt religious symbols and religious minorities. This paper reveals how political discourse in Quebec is further exacerbating this mistrust by privileging particular interpretations of religious symbols through an examination of the General Consultation and Public Hearings on Bill 60 (the Charter of Secularism) in 2014. Through an analysis of the transcripts from the hearings, I highlight how politicians have framed the conversation on religious symbols in the Quebec public sphere in a manner that obscures their relationship to personal piety and concretizes their diverse and ambivalent meanings into dogmatic messages.\n\nThis paper takes into consideration the work of Québécois director Xavier Dolan as a symptomatic example of a potentially counter-normative, female-empowered model of nationhood in Quebec’s post-revolutionary and post-referendary society. Stemming from a brief contextualization of Quebec's Quiet Revolution (1960s) as a site of heterocentric, nationalist drives, and employing a feminist and queer approach to nationalism to revise such paradigm, the paper aims to relocate Quebec into an alternative framework of nationhood, one that might find in femininity and queer subjectivities the necessary forces for the construction of a pluralist and more inclusive idea of nation. The reinforcement of motherhood and the revision of patriarchal hegemony depicted in the cinema of Xavier Dolan will be considered a benchmark for the revision of Quebec's nationalist and masculinist project in more flexible gendered terms.\n\nConvents and Catholic religious institutions undeniably constitute an important component of Quebec's religious heritage. Yet, popular and official interest in and concern over the preservation of these buildings seems to have grown exponentially in the last decade. Arguments over the demolition and reuse of properties of religious communities of women reveal the wide-ranging attitudes of concerned citizens, members of sisterhoods and the clergy, heritage advocates, and government. The ways religious heritage has been defined and packaged (for tourist consumption, to bolster national narratives) reflect not only gender asymmetries within the attribution and appreciation of religious heritage but also ambivalence toward the role of the Church in Quebec history. Les couvents et autres établissements religieux catholiques constituent indéniablement une composante importante du patrimoine religieux du Québec. Au cours de la dernière décennie, les intérêts populaires et officiels à préserver ces bâtiments et les préoccupations à cet égard ont augmenté de façon exponentielle. Les discussions sur la démolition ou l'attribution de nouvelles vocations aux édifices des communautés religieuses de femmes révèlent la grande diversité des attitudes des citoyens, des membres de communautés de femmes et du clergé, des défenseurs du patrimoine ainsi que du gouvernement. La façon dont le patrimoine religieux a été défini et présenté (pour consommation touristique, pour justifier le discours nationaliste) reflète non seulement des asymétries en fonction de l'appartenance à un sexe dans l'attribution et l'appréciation de ce patrimoine, mais aussi une ambivalence envers le rôle joué par l'Église dans l'histoire du Québec."
