        "text": "Of all 17 movies from my Severin sale haul, I decided to watch this first for obvious reasons and YES I fucking loved it. I knew I would because cats, but like I could watch this movie on a loop all day because it‚Äôs basically all about how cats are fiercely loyal to their chosen human(s) and if you‚Äôre stupid enough to get in the way of that then they will just fuck your shit up six ways from Sunday.\n\nGawd I love cats! Such perfect, loving, intelligent creatures who also happen to be ruthless killers. It‚Äôs really the perfect combination of traits! But I digress. The movie itself is highly entertaining and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see something where animals‚Ä¶\n\nYes, OK, it's true - these cats are killers. They are going to murder the hell out of you, and then eat your corpse. I admit it! But counterpoint: all those murdering, cruel bastards deserved it. I mean even if Donald Pleasence didn't flush a litter of kittens in the toilet, which he does, he still murdered his wife. And the cruel family the orphan gets adopted into, who decide to take her cat away from her and kill it. If anything, the cats were quite mellow in that one; those people should have been killed much harder. And the maid of that poor old woman and her conniving son, trying to get her inheritance? Well, they were too stupid‚Ä¶\n\nüíóDaily Horror Hunt #32 (Feb. 2021)üíó\n\n[12] CATS!\n\nMan, you're telling me there's been a 100% cat-themed anthology horror flick starring Peter Cushing, and I'm only just realizing it now!\n\nWilbur Gray (Cushing) is an ailurophobic horror writer, trying to get his latest novel published, as he has finally discovered the truth about cats. They are supernatural creatures who pull all the strings, and humanity will bow to their every whim... Well gee, great discovery there Wilbur, but any cat owner could've told you that! Thankfully he's got three gruesome tales of feline debauchery as proof, before eventually meeting his meowing maker in the end. You just don't cross the cats and live...\n\nThe stories were all quite fun, though‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúCats can‚Äôt talk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, they can. But it takes a long time to understand them.‚Äù\n\nHow I haven‚Äôt seen this before is blowing my cat loving mind, first it‚Äôs an anthology horror flick and second there‚Äôs the assumption that cats are in control of everything in the world. Which is totally accurate. Safe to say I thoroughly enjoyed this and all the cat paws, flesh-eating cats and just cats being cats.\n\n‚ÄúYears ago, people used to believe a cat was the devil in disguise.‚Äù\n\nBack to the movie, Peter Cushing plays a horror writer trying to convince his publisher that cats are actually supernatural creatures, he spews three tales all involving feline terror!\n\nI enjoyed the first two stories more‚Ä¶\n\nA paranoid writer tries to pitch his latest book to an incredulous publisher: an expose about cats being devilish creatures with supernatural abilities who murder any human that goes against their wishes and threatens their interests.\n\n\"The Uncanny\" is a prime example of those films we tend to call \"so bad it's good\". As a horror anthology it's pretty weak tea. The stories are basic and the notion of cute cats as ruthless killers is laughable. But the writing is so campy and the acting so howlingly bad that if you're in the right state of mind it's impossible not to have fun. The second story features the worst child acting I've ever seen and some of the most obnoxious‚Ä¶\n\nA very enjoyable horror anthology centered around three murderous tales of the Genus Felis. This is very similar in look, tone, and actor line-up to Amicus Productions anthologies of the 70's (personal favorites of mine) but while not technically one itself, it was co produced by Milton Subotsky, founder of Amicus along with Rank Productions and a couple French Canadians with l'accent aigu's above the vowels in their names. I only mention this because it feels very English and French Canadian; like a warm fire on a cold winter day, tea time with a side of maple syrup, fog, carriages and .... golden age Hollywood......OK so that part's a bit odd but it does all work together I promise you.‚Ä¶\n\nOffcourse looove the cat vibing to Levan Polkka but not more than that! Always have considered these smart ass creatures as selfish, unfeeling and arrogant assholes who neither leave too soon, nor can be easily tamed either. What they want, only they know; whimsical creatures but raees ppl are fond of them and these slick ass creatures have been slipping their asses into comfortable villas of aristocrats or bungalows of prideful bourgeoisies since centuries but here it seems like H√©roux has some new theories and (oh! damn) pretty good points to highlight for the mankind!\n\nTHE UNCANNY boasts a great great great line-up of brilliant cat actors who're all damn perfect in their scenes, specially when they starts biting and‚Ä¶\n\nSo‚Äîlet me get this straight. Peter Cushing is afraid of cats. He thinks they‚Äôve been manipulating humanity for centuries. And he tells Ray Milland the three spooky cat-centric tales that form this anthology in order to prove this. But‚Äîthe cats in these stories aren‚Äôt evil. They are the heroes. And I‚Äôm not saying this in a kind of ‚Äúthe shark in Jaws did nothing wrong, it‚Äôs just a wild animal, whaddaya expect‚Äù kind of way. It‚Äôs just impossible NOT to root for the cats in the stories, even if you‚Äôre not a cat lover like me and seemingly everyone who gave this film a good review. The cats in these stories harm murderers and bullies. They avenge wrongful deaths. In‚Ä¶"
