Daryl Hannah is to make a guest appearance on Hawaii Five-0.

The Kill Bill star will play a crooked realtor on the CBS drama's fourth season, says Access Hollywood.

Hannah is best known for her film work, including 1982's Blade Runner, 1984's Splash and 1987's Wall Street.

The 52-year-old's casting on Hawaii Five-0 marks one of her few television acting appearances.

Lost's Henry Ian Cusick, Nick Jonas and Melanie Griffith will also guest on Hawaii Five-0 this season.

The series returns to CBS on September 27 and airs on Sky1 in the UK.
