Daryl Hannah, the captivating actress known for her roles in films like “Blade Runner” and “Kill Bill,” has captivated audiences for decades.

However, there’s one aspect of her life that sparks curiosity.

She was married once, to musician Neil Young, from 2018 to 2021. However, their union did not result in any offspring.

Becoming a Stepmom to Neil Young’s Children

Public records and interviews consistently reveal that Daryl Hannah has not had any biological children.

Through her marriage to Neil Young, Hannah became a stepmom to his children. Young has three children from previous relationships:

Ben Young

Born with cerebral palsy, Ben has faced significant physical limitations throughout his life. However, he has emerged as a symbol of resilience and inspiration.

Ben’s condition played a crucial role in Neil Young’s life.

It directly inspired the creation of the Bridge School, a non-profit organization that provides communication and educational opportunities for children with severe disabilities.

Every year, Neil Young hosts the Bridge School Benefit Concerts, featuring renowned musicians, to raise funds for the school.

Despite his limitations, Ben has carved out his own path.

He started a successful egg farm on his family’s property in California, named Coastside Eggs. This demonstrates his entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to independence.

Ben’s story is one of overcoming challenges and achieving success. His journey inspires others to persevere in the face of adversity.

Neil Young’s daughter with his second wife, Pegi Young.

Neil Young’s children are Zeke Young and Ben Young. Keep in mind that information about celebrities and their families can change, and there might be updates or changes that occur.

Zeke Young

Zeke is Neil Young’s eldest son, born from his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress in 1972.

Like his half-brother Ben, Zeke was born with cerebral palsy. This condition has presented challenges throughout his life.

Details about Zeke’s personal life are scarce. He appears to maintain a private life away from the spotlight.

It’s important to acknowledge the privacy of Zeke Young, especially considering the potential challenges associated with cerebral palsy.

Despite the limited information available, it’s clear that Neil Young has expressed his love and support for all his children, including Zeke. In a 2021 birthday message, he called Zeke “my old friend and traveller.”
