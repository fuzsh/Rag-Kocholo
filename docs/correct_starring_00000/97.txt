Daryl Hannah has hinted at plans to return for the third Kill Bill movie.

Speaking to Film24, the 50-year-old said that director Quentin Tarantino always meant for the franchise to be a trilogy.

The Splash star also revealed that she would be game to reprise her role of Elle Driver, who was presumably blinded and left for dead in Kill Bill: Vol. 2.

"Think about it. There's always been a tradition of blind samurai, and you never actually saw [my character] expire in the other film," she said.

Uma Thurman recently admitted that she is keen to begin training for the upcoming third Kill Bill instalment.
