Daryl Hannah has spoken candidly about the poor quality of roles she’s been offered since her career-reviving turn in Kill Bill.

The actress, who made her name in 80s classics such as Splash, Wall Street and Blade Runner, landed her most high-profile role in a decade when Quentin Tarantino cast her as one-eyed assassin Elle Driver in the 2003-4 martial arts two-parter.

Despite winning critical acclaim for her performance, Hannah has now revealed that Kill Bill failed to boost her career long-term, saying that the roles she has been offered since have been “mostly crap”.

Asked if this bothers her, Hannah told the Sunday Times: “Not really, because I’ve been working for a long time and, to a certain extent, I’m satiated. I’m not ambitious or desperate to be working all the time, because I have a lot of other interests and creative outlets. But, at the same time, it’s insulting when you read a piece of crap and you’re like, ‘Is this really what it’s come down to? Thanks a lot.'”
