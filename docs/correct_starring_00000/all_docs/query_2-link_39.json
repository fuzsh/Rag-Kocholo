        "text": "DENVER — Daryl Hannah, who played the villainous, one-eyed assassin Elle Driver in Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” movies, has big plans for her character’s 1980 T-topped Trans Am.\n\n“I’m turning the Trans Am from “Kill Bill” into an electric car,” she tells me. “I think it will be a really good spokesmodel for electric cars.”\n\nHannah has long been an advocate for biodiesel, driving an old, black Chevy El Camino that she had converted.\n\n“My El Camino has been an ambassador for biodiesel because it’s badass-looking,” she said. Hannah hopes her badass Trans Am will do the same for electric cars, but there are limitations.\n\n“Because it’s a heavier car, it’s not going to get as long a range,” she said. “But I’m on solar.” Hannah lives on a ranch in the Rocky Mountain West that has been off the grid for 16 years. She hopes her alternative-energy lifestyle will inspire others.\n\nDenver Mayor John Hickenlooper and Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. invited her to the Mile High City to speak at events surrounding the Democratic National Convention, whose organizers boast incessantly that they are running the greenest convention ever.\n\nHannah would not walk inside the Pepsi Center, where Democrats were giving speech after speech about how they represent change and Republican John McCain does not.\n\n“That’s the thing about politics I’m not so interested in,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if you are red or blue. We all need to be more green.”\n\nHannah met me in a basement bar that had been taken over by Fox News, just outside the Pepsi Center. We sat in an intimate booth where I could gaze directly into those sky-blue eyes that have set so many big screens ablaze. This 47-year-old actress is often described as the sexiest woman alive. And naturally, when you are with the sexiest woman alive, you do what you can to make conversation.\n\nHannah was born in Chicago. I was born in Chicago. Hannah was born in December 1960. I was born in December 1961.\n\nHannah has a blog, www.dhlovelife.com, where she recently did a piece on New Jersey entrepreneur Tom Szaky, who makes a mean plant fertilizer out of worm poop.\n\nTurns out, I did a piece last year on Szaky, CEO of Terracycle Inc. I told Hannah how I took Szaky to New York City’s Smith & Wollensky and ate steaks with him while he displayed his worm poop products on the table. Hannah smiled and seemed impressed when I handed her a copy of the column. Who’d have thought worm poop could get me a smile, and later a hug, from the mermaid in “Splash?”\n\nLike me, Hannah also took a ride in the $109,000 electric-powered Tesla Roadster on display during the DNC. I showed her the photos I had shot of the ultra-sleek Lotus-like sports car, and told her I wished it could be my midlife crisis.\n\n“That’s what I just called it,” she said with a laugh. “When I was doing that electric-car interview, I called it a midlife-crisis car.”\n\nUnfortunately, that’s where the parallels ended. Hannah is a Hollywood icon and I am just a geek who writes business stories. I am clearly not cut out for the celebrity beat. I had to shake off a serious bout of star-struck love sickness before I could sit down and write this column.\n\nAnd I swear that as I wrote the preceding few sentences on my laptop at a modestly priced restaurant called the Delectable Egg in downtown Denver, Sean Penn paid his tab and walked out.\n\nI didn’t even notice him sitting in here, since I’d been thinking about Hannah so intensely. But I finally heard someone cry out, “That was Sean Penn.” He’s probably about the coolest guy a business writer could expect to meet. It happened so fast, there was no time to react and ask Penn what kind of car he planned to drive.\n\nAnother movie star with a cause, I suppose, romping around the DNC.\n\nThe point, though, is salient. Petroleum does not have to be the fuel of the future. Eventually, it will just get too expensive.\n\nIf the sexiest woman alive can take clunky 1980s-vintage beasts and run them on biodiesel or electricity, imagine what technologically advanced automotive engineers could do.\n\n“We need to move toward a fossil-fuel-free economy,” said Hannah, “and start thinking about a future that makes more sense.”"
