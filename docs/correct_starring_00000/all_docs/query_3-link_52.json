        "text": "What’s Tarantino got to do with it?\n\nAsian representation in media has been an uphill battle almost from the start. It’s no different in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill, where we see Asian stereotypes both reinforced and challenged through the film’s cinematic aesthetic, accents, and wardrobe. Granted, the movie’s a bit dated at this point, and Tarantino’s main plot really isn’t about pushing forward our Asian representation agenda. In fact, it’s easy to glance at the movie poster and think, Great, another white woman holding a samurai sword, playing someone who should have been Asian. She’s even dressed like Bruce Lee, and the poster is yellow. SMH.\n\nI think there’s more than what meets the eye. Whether or not Tarantino intended to be an ally or was simply a connoisseur of martial arts films, through an analysis of a couple different scenes in Kill Bill, I present the perspective that perhaps the “reclaiming of yellow” can be done in partnership with those who aren’t directly part of the Asian community. But the responsibility ultimately lies with us.\n\nLet’s talk about Lucy Liu\n\nWhen you think Kill Bill, Uma Thurman is probably the first person who comes to mind — The Bride. We’ll explore her character eventually, but first let’s talk about Lucy Liu, who plays The Bride’s main antagonist. Liu plays O-Ren Ishii, a ruthless, powerful assassin who leads her own personal army, the Crazy 88. A decent amount of time is spent building out her backstory. At the age of 9, young O-Ren helplessly watches yakuza (Japanese gang) assassinate her parents. At the age of 11, she enacts revenge on the man who murdered her parents by seducing him and assassinating him before he can attempt to do anything else to her. What an origin story.\n\nTarantino paints her story as an anime rather than live action — an appreciated but unexpected interruption to the overall cinematic experience.There are multiple interpretations as to why Tarantino chooses to use anime to illustrate O-Ren’s backstory, and the animation producer has even given a high-level explanation of Tarantino’s decision. In some ways, it could be that anime gave Tarantino more freedom to exaggerate the scenes in a way that would not be realistically possible (although, his movies are already often filled with excessive violence, bloody bodies, and flying limbs). But I think his integration of anime was an attempt at paying homage to a form of Japanese media and art.\n\nPartnering with a Japanese studio can be argued as one way of releasing the agency of representation back to its rightful owner. When O-Ren’s narrative is portrayed in anime, an art style and media format uniquely Japanese, the power of representation is now in the hands of Japanese artists, artists who interestingly enough, depict European characters at the end of the sequence in a rather unsophisticated and unflattering way (a reflection of Asia’s stereotypes of the West?).\n\nHere comes The Bride (with an accent)\n\nLet me summarize Kill Bill’s plot in one sentence: The Bride loses her child and almost her life at her own wedding, and seeks out her revenge on everyone who was involved (O-Ren Ishii included).\n\nOn her quest to seek out the assassins from her previous life, she first must arm herself with a weapon. She travels to Okinawa and enters a small sushi restaurant owned by Hattori Hanzo, a famous samurai sword smith. When they first meet, Hattori is pleasantly surprised by The Bride’s ability to speak some Japanese. He welcomes her and remarks, “You say Japanese word like you Japanese,” to which she responds with, “Oh now you’re making fun of me.” He’s clearly being polite.\n\nHattori’s broken, accented English makes sense. He’s a local from Japan and didn’t grow up speaking English. (You might even say it’s impressive that he can converse well in English at all. In a later scene, we see that a translator is needed when O-Ren switches from speaking in Japanese to English with her yakuza council.) We can’t get mad about that, but cue the eye rolls when you hear about yet another Asian actor/actress asked to play a role with a strong “Asian accent”.\n\nHollywood has historically assigned accents to people of color in media, not always taking the time to consider whether the film’s narrative and context made an accent appropriate. Even when producers and creators have taken the time to intentionally include accents, such as for immigrant roles, there have been a multitude of mixed responses on the authenticity of these accents (read more from the creator of All American Girl, Constance Wu in Fresh off the Boat, and Paul Lee in Kim’s Convenience).\n\nInterestingly enough, in Kill Bill it’s not accented English that’s worth talking about. Liu speaks English flawlessly when playing O-Ren. It’s actually when she speaks Japanese that she has an accent. But you wouldn’t know that unless you were a native Japanese speaker or at least, familiar with the language. (When Kill Bill was viewed by Japanese audiences, they immediately noticed!) So our English-speaking audiences aren’t likely to realize that Thurman has an accent when speaking Japanese too — even if she seems to exponentially improve in her Japanese speaking abilities with Hattori.\n\nCulture as distinct as restaurant categories\n\nNow, let’s cut back to O-Ren Ishii. She has just been chosen as the new head of the yakuza council. O-Ren sits at the head of a rectangular table while the rest of the council — all men—sit alongside the table. Each man’s appearance drips overwhelmingly with attributes that emphasize masculinity, but only one is man enough to to bring up what’s on everyone’s mind—the fact they have a female leader.\n\nBoss Tanaka angrily speaks of “the pervasion done to this council…by making a Chinese Jap-American half breed b*tch its leader.” Naturally, O-Ren takes great offense at this and in a savage yet elegant motion, swiftly runs across the banquet table and beheads him. She is less offended by him insinuating there is something wrong with her gender and is more offended that he sees her mixed heritage as a negative attribute. Tanaka’s anger and O-Ren’s burst of outrage hardly seem out of place given the nature of Tarantino’s films (there are bloodier scenes than this). But a deeper analysis of the driving forces behind their strong emotions reflect intra-Asian racism, a theme not often explored in Western media, as well as the sensitivity of a “mixed” cultural identity, something only starting to take root in Hollywood today.\n\nIt’s hard enough to reconcile what it means to be Asian American (or any “hyphenated Asian”), let alone understand the role we play in the grander Asian diaspora. It doesn’t help when mainstream media lumps together Asian cultures as one (except, you know, when we’re restaurant categories). Given Hollywood’s turbulent history with Asian representation, it can be refreshing to see cultural distinctions being made. Liu, a Chinese American, plays O-Ren, a Chinese Japanese-American, which feels like a small win, especially in the early 2000's. (On the flip side, you could say that an even larger win would have been if a Chinese Japanese-American actress who fluently speaks Japanese were casted for this role. But…I try to stay optimistic.) O-Ren’s violent response to Tanaka is probably not the way to go when we confront racially charged comments in our own contexts, but her actions in this scene boldly challenge mainstream Western conceptions of Asian culture and identity, reminding us that we are not “lesser” for coming from a blend of cultural backgrounds.\n\nA fashionable finale\n\nOur two lead women face-off in a fashionable finale at “The House of Blue Leaves” teahouse. It’s not just their clothes that are worth commenting on; there are many other notable outfits in this scene.\n\nThe teahouse appear to be run by a luxuriously dressed middle-aged woman and, in stark contrast, a simple man dressed in an outfit reminiscent of monk robes. The zig zag motif on his yellow outfit and his nearly bald head result in jabs from customers referring to him as Charlie Brown and unreasonably requesting pepperoni pizza. The Crazy 88s wear suits with black masks over their eyes (what are they trying to be, ninjas?) and wield a mixture of weapons, including samurai swords and axes. Gogo, O-Ren’s main bodyguard, is a young woman who fights in a cute Japanese uniform. She dresses the part of your generic sweet schoolgirl, but the way she wields her modern Medieval spiked ball-and-chain flail is anything but sweet. The outfits and weapons blur lines between the West and the East.\n\nO-Ren and The Bride face off in one-on-one samurai sword combat outside the teahouse. O-Ren wears a white kimono and almost blends in with the snowy Zen garden while The Bride wears a yellow jump suit with black stripes on the side. Her yellow outfit bears an incredible likeness to Bruce Lee’s iconic outfit. This reference to Lee can be seen an ode to not just him as an actor, but also to the pioneering role he played in the 70’s in establishing martial arts as a Western movie genre, despite the racism and discrimination he endured in Hollywood.\n\nCultural and personal tensions are at an all time high during their fight when O-Ren comments, “Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with swords. You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai.” Oof. In just one line, O-Ren savagely calls out The Bride for her fascination with a culture that is not and cannot be hers. But maybe it’s not just The Bride who’s being called out. Western audiences have long fetishized Asian culture, Tarantino himself included."
