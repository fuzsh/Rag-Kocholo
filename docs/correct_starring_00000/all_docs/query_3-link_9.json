        "text": "I have expressed my opinion regarding new Quentin Tarantino projects multiple times: you simply can't trust a word he says. The man has the worst case of ADD ever seen and has a brain that runs at about 2,000 mph. There will always be another project (though there was some doubt between Jackie Brown and Kill Bill) and said project may even get mentioned in the thousands of other ideas the director throws to the press during the time between production schedules. So what if word comes down from one of the stars of the supposed film instead?\n\nDuring an interview discussing her new film, A Closed Book, with Film24, Daryl Hannah began to discuss plans for the third episode in Tarantino's Kill Bill series, not only confirming that the project will happen, but that he character, Elle Driver, will be playing a key role. It has been rumored since 2004, when a question mark appeared next to Elle's name in the closing credits instead of a strikethrough, that a third installment would feature the daughter of Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) seeking revenge against The Bride for the death of her mother, and receiving training from the now-blind Driver. The kicker? Don't expect the project on a production slate until 2014."
