        "text": "#10: “Kill Bill” (2003-04)\n\nThe relationship between director Quentin Tarantino and star Uma Thurman quickly deteriorated as the production of “Kill Bill” was dragged out into two separate movies, which included dangerous stunts that reportedly left Thurman hospitalized. But she also couldn’t stand to be around co-star Daryl Hannah, who played Elle, another of the Deadly Vipers. This didn’t affect the finished movie since their characters spent all their screen time trying to kill one another, but it did mean that they allegedly had to have completely separate tents by the time the sequel premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Only time will tell whether this will affect the rumored third instalment.\n\n#9: “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?” (1962)\n\nOne of the most famous rivalries in Hollywood was between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and it was so well-known that Ryan Murphy even turned the story into the basis of FX show “Feud.” The fighting actually began long before filming “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”, when both stars were vying for the affections of actor Franchot Tone. After decades of behind-the-scenes battling, they were finally cast in a movie together, though on-screen scraps were a little too real by some accounts. On the Oscar trail, Davis was nominated for Best Actress, but when Anne Bancroft won and couldn’t attend, it was Crawford who got up on stage to accept on her behalf.\n\n#8: “Sex and the City” (2008-10)\n\nIt’s ironic that such a cornerstone of TV’s representation of female friendship should have an ongoing war between two of its leads behind it. The root of these problems often seems to be Kim Cattrall, who’s allegedly gotten on the wrong side of most of her former co-stars, but especially Sarah Jessica Parker. This seemingly goes back to the show’s second season when Parker was given an executive producer credit and a pay rise, leaving Cattrall to play catch up. Money problems got so bad that the cast and crew avoided Cattrall, even refusing to sit with her at the Emmys. The series eventually expanded onto the big screen, though there were reports that Catrall and Parker weren’t on speaking terms by the 2nd film. To this day, there continues to bel bad blood - with the possibility of a 3rd film continuously being crushed over and over again.\n\n#7: “Fifty Shades” franchise (2015-18)\n\nDespite playing on-screen lovers Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson were far from friends at the beginning. Rumors of them having no chemistry and hating being on set together plagued the first movie, some of which were attributed to the fact that Dornan was a last-minute replacement for Charlie Hunnam, who was originally tapped for the role. Thankfully, the first press tour for “Fifty Shades” led to the pair bonding and becoming genuine friends for the second and third movies, and stories of their feud have been widely dismissed as gossip - however, there’s no denying that there’s still some awkwardness to be seen in those early interviews.\n\n#6: “Magic Mike” (2012)\n\nAfter he fell out with leading man Channing Tatum, behind-the-scenes negativity became the reason Alex Pettyfer wasn’t asked to return as Adam for “Magic Mike’s” sequel. Things started when director Steven Soderbergh insisted on casting Pettyfer despite his reputation for being difficult, and against Tatum’s – whose life inspired the film – wishes. Things culminated when Pettyfer leased an apartment from one of Tatum’s friends and fell behind in rent following a family tragedy, leading to angry e-mails from Tatum demanding he pay up. Pettyfer has since admitted that the feud was his own fault, but this clearly wasn’t enough for him to be asked back for “Magic Mike XXL.”\n\n#5: “Romeo + Juliet” (1996)\n\nWhile they played the most famous couple in history, Claire Danes reportedly wasn’t Leonardo DiCaprio’s biggest fan on the set of Baz Luhrmann’s modern Shakespearean adaptation. This was because Leo was allegedly very immature back in 1996 and pulled pranks on set, and he thought Danes was “uptight.” Though later stories have come out suggesting that this was all just gossip, and some sources claiming Clarie even crushed on Leo, it’s interesting to note that, when Danes was offered a role alongside DiCaprio in Clint Eastwood’s “J. Edgar” – she turned it down. Though this decision was said to be made in favor of the lead role in “Homeland,” who knows if any remaining beef with her old co-star may remain.\n\n#4: “Blade: Trinity” (2004)\n\nWesley Snipes supposedly managed to get on the wrong side of everyone while filming “Blade: Trinity”, as told in a series of anecdotes from Patton Oswalt. According to the actor, Snipes would stay in his trailer smoking marijuana all day every day and was never sober on set, but far worse was his decision to always be in character as Blade. During filming, things deteriorated so much between Snipes and director David Goyer that Snipes reportedly tried to strangle him, which led to Goyer hiring a biker gang to pose as his security detail. He also refused to appear in scenes that didn’t have his face in them, and his dislike for Ryan Reynolds meant Reynolds improvised as many lines as possible and got more screen time.\n\n#3: “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015)\n\nMax and Furiosa got off to a rocky start, but they slowly learned to trust each other – or, was that Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron? As luck would have it, the two leads apparently didn’t like each other just as much as the characters didn’t. Zoe Kravitz blamed the difficult filming conditions for accentuating personality differences that were already there, saying everybody had issues at one point or another because they spent half a year in the desert. Theron has said that her tricky relationship with Hardy was part of what made the movie what it is, which is a sentiment echoed by director George Miller.\n\n#2: “The Fast and the Furious” franchise (2001-)\n\nFor years, Vin Diesel was the main man of the “Fast & Furious” franchise, but that changed when Dwayne Johnson debuted as Luke Hobbs in “Fast Five.” Their personality clash was extreme and has seemingly only gotten worse as time has gone on, peaking in the run-up to the eighth instalment. The Rock took to Instagram to air his complaints about “candy-ass” male co-stars, claiming that the filming the franchise got his “blood boiling.” Things progressed to the point that he won’t appear in the ninth movie, instead favoring his spin-off with Jason Statham, even though it ultimately disappointed at the box office.\n\n#1: “Star Wars” franchise (1977-)\n\nFor years, nobody knew that C-3P0 and R2-D2 were not the best of friends underneath their costumes. It wasn’t until “Revenge of the Sith” wrapped that either of them spoke about their dislike for each other, with Kenny Baker – R2 – accusing Anthony Daniels – 3P0 – of being rude and standoffish back then. Baker repeatedly called out Daniels for allegedly not getting on with any of the cast, while Daniels was reported as once saying Baker’s role was redundant and he “might as well be a bucket.” Despite this, Daniels did join in with the tributes to Baker after his death in 2016, tweeting that he would always be remembered."
