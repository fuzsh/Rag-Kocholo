        "text": "Daryl Hannah is best known for her roles in Blade Runner, Splash, Wall Street and the Kill Bill films.\n\nHannah was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1960 and made her film debut in 1978 with a brief appearance in Brian De Palma's horror film The Fury, but her first notable role was as \"Pris\" in Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. In 1984 she starred alongside Tom Hanks in the mermaid fantasy film Splash, this was her first leading role and is considered to be her 'break.'\n\nHer career stared to wane in the 90s, but her more recent role as the one-eyed assassin Elle Driver in Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 brought her back into the limeight as a leading lady.\n\nHannah has never married, but has been linked to John Kennedy Jr and singer Jackson Browne. She has no children and currently lives alone in Colorado."
