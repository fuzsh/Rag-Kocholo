Thurman wears her iconic yellow track suit. Struck on Fujicolor Crystal Archive paper stock. The first entry in Tarantino's bloody two-part female vigilante film. A female samurai assassin wakes from a four-year coma following a sadistic attack, and resolves to seek revenge on her former colleagues for their betrayal. A love letter to the glory days of martial arts cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, with a grindhouse temperament and even nods to giallo, incorporating practical effects in lieu of computer-generated imagery, and with nods as usual to samurai and other exploitation films throughout. Shot on location in Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Lancaster, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Austin, Texas. 12 x 8 inches. Near Fine. - Kill Bill: Volume 1 (Original photograph from of Uma Thurman and Quentin Tarantino on the set of the 2003 film)",
