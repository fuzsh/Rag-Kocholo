        "text": "In my review of Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1,\" I said I felt \"compelled\" to give the film a positive review because \"it's slick, stylish and undeniable fun. At no point was I bored.\"\n\nNow follows \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2,\" which is technically not a sequel but the second half of the same movie, in which killer assassin The Bride, aka Black Mamba, played by Uma Thurman, gets to finish off her \"rampage of revenge.\" The character also is assigned two more names, one of which, Beatrix Kiddo, sounds made-up but is in fact her real name.\n\n\"Vol. 2\" is several orders of magnitude less violent than \"Vol. 1,\" as the rivers of blood that spewed forth with serio-comic indulgence have waned to a mere trickle.\n\nIt's hard to believe the contrasting depictions of violence belong to the same movie, so I can only assume most of the gore was edited out as Tarantino's sneering reaction to those who chastised the first film for being too bloody.\n\n\"Vol. 2\" is a good movie, probably better than \"Vol. 1,\" but it still lacks much in the way of substance to complement the writer/director's dizzying style. The movie jumps in and out of black-and-white, rushes forward in the story before reverting to lengthy flashbacks and plays around with the conventions of film storytelling.\n\nIt's fun, but forgettable.\n\nIf \"Vol. 1\" seemed like Tarantino's paean to cheesy samurai flicks and Hong Kong crime stories, then \"Vol. 2\" is a self-conscious ode to the Western. Most of the action takes place in the dusty plains of Texas and Mexico, and characters sprawl out their dialogue in the rangy tones of portent.\n\nTo recap the story thus far: The Bride was attacked at her wedding (actually, the wedding rehearsal, we learn), her groom and guests murdered; she was shot in the head and left in a coma for four years, robbed of the baby in her womb. The Bride killed two members of the assassination squad and her former colleagues who committed the deed.\n\nThat leaves three names on The Bride's list: Elle Driver, aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), a blonde with a cold heart and one eye; Budd, aka Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), who now works as a bouncer at a strip club; and Bill, the boss who needs no surname.\n\nThe plot? The Bride finds her assailants, they fight, somebody dies. There are a few side trips, such as a visit to a degenerate old Mexican pimp and an extended flashback in which we learn of The Bride's tutelage under a cruel martial arts master (Gordon Liu) who's at least 1,000 years old.\n\nBill, who was only a disembodied voice in the first movie, gets plenty of screen time this go-round. He's played by David Carradine as a measured man of violence, a killer who does so without hesitation but not with pleasure. Carradine is the only actor who manages to get around the spastic patter of Tarantino's dialogue, which always sounds too cool to have been spoken off the cuff.\n\nThurman, who's credited as creating the film's characters along with Tarantino, plays The Bride with a layer of irony so deep we never know whether to laugh or feel intimidated. The Bride - excuse me, Beatrix - is defined only by her thirst for revenge and her extraordinary physical capability to carry it out.\n\nChristopher Lloyd is entertainment editor at the Star-Banner in Ocala."
