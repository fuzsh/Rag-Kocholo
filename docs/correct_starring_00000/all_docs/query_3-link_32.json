        "text": "The genre of martial arts films is sometimes ill-defined. A subcategory of action movies, martial arts movies are usually defined as films that showcase martial arts combat. These films typically feature training montages or scenes, impressive fight choreography and high entertainment value. While some martial arts movies are often considered cheesy and corny, many aren’t, and usually, cheesy ones simply suffer from less-than-ideal dubs. There have been films made about almost every type of martial art, from MMA to Judo to karate. Martial arts movies also come from many countries. However, certain styles are used more often in the genre, and many films come from specific regions, such as Hong Kong. Whether it is 90s action movies, the Golden Age of Hong Kong Cinema, Academy Award Winners, Cult Classics or even the faves of Quentin Tarantino, there are many great martial arts films, and the best have made this list.\n\nTop Martial Arts Movies\n\nThe first martial arts film was made in China in the late 1920s; since then, the genre has exploded in popularity. While Hong Kong established itself as a martial arts film production leader in the 1970s and 1980s with producers like Shaw Brothers and Godfrey Ho, The U.S., Indonesia and Thailand have established themselves as emerging and flourishing martial arts movie makers.\n\nMartial arts movies are often only as good as their stars since stunt performing and fight choreography are central to many of these films. Actors like Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa, Sammo Hung, Bruce Lee, Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh are synonymous with the genre itself and are all featured on this list. This list controversially excludes Samurai movies, which are often lumped into this genre. (However, they feel deserving of a separate list.) This list also excludes so-called “Gun Fu” films such as John Wick, where weapons (primarily guns) are preferred to martial arts. Finally, this list seeks to balance its ranking by giving relevance to both the overall experience of watching the film and the impressiveness of the martial arts scenes themselves.\n\n30. The Last Dragon (1985)\n\nThe Last Dragon is a true cult classic. It isn’t a perfect movie, but it is deeply fun to watch. From literally glowing martial artists to what is practically a DeBarge music video, the film is a little out there. It follows a martial artist who has to take on an evil businessman and the “Shogun of Harlem” after saving a video DJ.\n\nMichael Schultz directed the film, which stars Taimak, Vanity, Julius Carry, Christopher Murney, Keshia Knight Pulliam and Faith Prince. Notably, Taimak was a 20-year-old martial arts student who had never acted before the film. However, he is wildly likable and charming in the movie. The film was also produced by Berry Gordy and has an iconic Motown soundtrack. Yes, it is very 1980s, but 50 years later, that is part of the fun. The Last Dragon is currently streaming for free on Tubi.\n\n29. Warrior (2011)\n\nThe only film on this list about MMA, Warrior follows two estranged brothers from Pittsburgh as they compete in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film was directed by Gavin O'Connor and stars Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton and Nick Nolte.\n\nWarrior is a brutal film, but one that takes a sensitive and emotionally fulfilling look at family, redemption and conflict. Nolte was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work on the film. The film also features several cameos from real MMA fighters and some impressive MMA scenes. It is currently streaming on Peacock.\n\n28. Polite Society (2023)\n\nPolite Society might be polarizing. Part wacky comedy, part martial arts film, part coming-of-age story and part satire on women’s place in British-Pakistani society, Polite Society has a lot going on. The film follows a teenage girl who dreams of becoming a stunt woman as she tries to save her sister from an upcoming marriage.\n\nPolite Society is Nida Manzoor's feature directorial debut. It stars Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya and Nima Bucha. The film captures much of the fun of an old Kung Fu films while still making a point about the validity of women’s dreams and ambitions. It is currently streaming on Amazon Prime.\n\n27. The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter (1984)\n\nIs The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter a little campy and melodramatic? Yes, but that is part of what makes it great. Produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers, the film was written and directed by Lau Kar-leung and stars Gordon Liu, Alexander Fu and Kara Hui. Fu was in a fatal car accident during filming, and the final scenes were rewritten.\n\nThe film follows an epic battle between a treacherous general and the sons of a loyal general during the Song Dynasty. The reason to watch this film is for the fight choreography which is both detailed and intense. It is available to stream on Amazon Prime with MUBI.\n\n26. Chocolate (2008)\n\nThere are many great martial arts films helmed by young women (Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan, Come Drink with Me and Yes, Madam also come to mind), and Chocolate is among them. The film follows an autistic girl who learns martial arts skills by watching Bruce Lee and Tony Jaa films and uses her skills to take down a gang that owes her ailing mother money.\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics, the fight scenes are so good that they more than make up for the somewhat inconsistent pacing. The film also features some martial arts that often aren’t portrayed in films, including Capoeira and Muay Thai. The film was directed by Prachya Pinkaew and stars Yanin \"Jeeja\" Vismistananda in her film debut. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi, PlutoTV and Peacock.\n\n25. Sanshiro Sugata (1943)\n\nSanshiro Sugata is a film about the birth of Judo. It follows a young man in the 1880s who hopes to become a jujitsu master before learning about a new martial art style, Judo. The film was Akira Kurosawa's directorial debut, and while it isn’t often listed among his best films, it has a gritty quality that works well for the martial arts genre.\n\nUnfortunately, the film was censored due to Japanese wartime laws, and seven minutes of the film were lost in the process. It has been remade several times in Japan, and Kurosawa also directed a sequel in 1945’s Sanshiro Sugata Part II. Sanshiro Sugata is currently streaming for free on Plex.\n\n24. The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978)\n\nAnother film produced by the Shaw Brothers, The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (also sometimes called The Master Killer, Shaolin Master Killer or Shao Lin San Shi Liu Fang) follows a young boy who trains in kung fu to take revenge on the Manchu government after they attacked his temple.\n\nThe film was directed by Lau Kar-leung and stars Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh. The film has a more comedic sequel, 1980’s Return to the 36th Chamber and a third film, 1985’s Disciples of the 36th Chamber. However, the first film is easily the best of the series. The film has been referenced by the Wu-Tang Clan, including in their first album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). It is available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\n23. Shaolin Soccer (2001)\n\nShaolin Soccer isn’t your average martial arts film, but nothing from Stephen Chow really is. While his 2004 film, Kung Fu Hustle, is probably more famous, Shaolin Soccer is an under-appreciated gem. It follows a group of former Shaolin monks who use their superhuman martial arts skills to play soccer. It stars Chow (who also wrote and directed it), Zhao Wei, Ng Man-tat, Patrick Tse and Danny Chan Kwok-kwan.\n\nThe film was initially banned in China but did well in Hong Kong. The film also influenced Edgar Wright and his film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Shaolin Soccer is also a favorite of Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, who also used it as inspiration for their show Avatar: The Last Airbender (specifically the look of elemental bending.) The film is currently available to rent on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n22. Fearless (2006)\n\nFearless is loosely based on the life of Huo Yuanjia, a Chinese martial artist who challenged foreign fighters to public matches during the Qing Dynasty. The film has many historical inaccuracies and was even sued by Huo’s descendants. However, it doesn’t take away from the impressive choreography and beauty of the film.\n\nThe film was directed by Ronny Yu and stars Jet Li. It was cut down for its theatrical release; however, the director's cut was later released in 2008. This cut notably includes an opening scene with Michelle Yeoh explaining the sport of wushu and a fight scene with a Thai fighter played by Olympic boxer Somluck Kamsing. It is available to rent on Apple TV.\n\n21. The Prodigal Son (1981)\n\nThe Prodigal Son is loosely based on the life of Leung Chang and follows a wealthy martial arts student who learns that his father has been paying off his opponents to lose matches. Directed, written and starring Sammo Hung, it is a classic traditional kung fu film.\n\nThe film is funny without fully being a comedy and delivers some great fight scenes. It is fast-paced and enjoyable throughout and really everything you want from the genre. While it can be found online, The Prodigal Son is unfortunately not available streaming.\n\n20. The Matrix (1999)\n\nThe Matrix isn’t higher on this list because, in many ways, it is more of a sci-fi epic than a martial arts film, but c’mon, he knows Kung Fu. The film follows an unlikely hero as he learns that the world around him is a simulation.\n\nDirected by The Wachowskis, the film stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. The Matrix is widely considered one of the best Sci-Fi films of all time. The film functions as a trans narrative, religious allusion and dystopian critique, and is also just a fun watch. The Matrix won four Academy Awards and was heralded for its visual effects. While the original film has led to sequels, prequels and spin-offs, the original is easily the best. The Matrix is currently available to watch on Netflix.\n\n19. The Karate Kid (1984)\n\nYou either don’t think of The Karate Kid as a martial arts film, or you think of it as THE martial arts film. Either way, while there have been ups and downs in the franchise, the original is a better film than it sometimes gets credit for. Upon the release of the 2010 remake, film critic Dana Stevens wrote that the original “may have seemed like a standard-issue inspirational sports picture at the time, but… a generation of remove reveals what a well-crafted movie it actually was.”\n\nThe film follows a kid who learns karate from his apartment’s handyman to stand up to his bullies. The Karate Kid stars Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, William Zabka and Elisabeth Shue. Morita even received an Oscar nomination for his role as Mr. Miyagi. While The Karate Kid is mainly remembered for its wax-on-wax-off training montage, it features unlikely friendship, the stain of Japanese internment in America and impressive fight choreography. The film is available to stream on Starz.\n\n18. Kill Bill vol. 1 (2003)\n\nWhile Vol. 2 is also fantastic, the first Kill Bill is more of a martial arts movie since it has a kung fu training montage and uses of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Japanese Kenjutsu and Escrima. Kill Bill is an homage to 1973’s Lady Snowblood and follows a woman’s quest for revenge after being left for dead by her ex-lover and his squad of assassins.\n\nThe film was directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox and David Carradine. Thurman was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her role as “The Bride.” The film has several notable fight scenes; however, the most famous is probably the scene featuring the “Crazy 88.” It is available to rent on YouTube, Amazon Prime, Apple TV and Google Play.\n\n17. Hero (2002)\n\nSet during the Warring States period of ancient China, Hero follows a nameless warrior who recounts the story of defeating three assassins to the king. The film was an immediate hit in China. However, it didn’t premiere in the U.S.A. until 2004, after Quentin Tarantino convinced Miramax to bring it to theaters. The film then became the first Chinese-language film to top the American box office.\n\nThe film, directed by Zhang Yimou, stars Jet Li, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung. It is strikingly beautiful and features music from the China Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Hero was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n16. Master of the Flying Guillotine (1976)\n\nWritten, directed and starring Jimmy Wang Yu, Master of the Flying Guillotine is the sequel to his 1972 film One-Armed Boxer. The film follows Yu as a one-armed martial arts master who has to defend himself after a Tibetan lama seeks revenge for actions taken in the first film.\n\nThe film is a favorite of Quentin Tarantino and currently holds a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Elvis Mitchell wrote for the New York Times, “​​But once you find the groove of this delectable cheese fest, you'll realize how influential Guillotine has been. Traces of it can be seen in movies from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to the battle dazzler The Blade, which is Guillotine remade to look like a ‘Zoom, zoom, zoom’ Mazda commercial.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi and Plex.\n\n15. Drunken Master II (1994)\n\nSometimes called The Legend of Drunken Master, Drunken Master II is technically a sequel to 1978’s Drunken Master. While both movies star Jackie Chan as a man who must drink before he can use his impressive martial arts skills, the second one is better partially due to its higher budget and remarkable fight choreography.\n\nHalf action movie, half comedy, Drunken Master II was directed by Lau Kar-leung. The film is one of three on this list about the life of Wong Fei-hung. However, it takes a far more comedic approach than the other two. It is currently available to rent on Amazon, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n14. Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\nThe only reason this film isn’t higher on this list is that it isn’t exactly a martial arts movie. As the title implies, there is a lot going on here: comedy, surrealism, generational trauma, drama, experimental filmmaking, etc. However, Everything Everywhere All at Once has a couple of can’t miss martial arts scenes, especially the one with Ke Huy Quran and a fanny pack.\n\nDirected by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and starring Michelle Yeoh, Quan and Stephanie Hsu, the film follows an overworked mother as she realizes she has the ability to jump between parallel dimensional versions of herself. While the film was originally written for Jackie Chan, it was rewritten for Yeoh. The film won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n\n13. Fist of Fury (1972) and Fist of Legend (1994)\n\nIt might be unfair for these films to share a spot. However, Fist of Legend is a remake of Fist of Fury. Both films are classics of the genre and absolute must-watches. Both follow a fighter who returns home for the funeral of his teacher, who died under mysterious circumstances. Fury stars Bruce Lee, while Legend stars Jet Li.\n\nBoth martial arts legends deliver some of the best fight choreography of their careers in these films. While Fist of Fury obviously inspired Fist of Legend, Fist of Legend also inspired another movie, The Matrix. The Wachowski sisters even hired the film’s fight choreographer, Yuen Woo-Ping, to work on their Sci-Fi classic. Fist of Fury is streaming for free on Tubi and Pluto, while Fist of Legend is streaming for free on Sling TV.\n\n12. Dragon Inn (1967)\n\nDragon Inn follows a warrior who seeks to defend the children of a condemned general from the secret police in 1400s China. Written and directed by King Hu, the film stars Lingfeng Shangguan, Chun Shih and Ying Bai. While the film isn’t as dynamic in terms of plot as some of the other films on this list, Dragon Inn is foundational for the wuxia genre (a genre of Chinese fiction about martial artists in ancient China.)\n\nWhile the film has been remade twice (1992’s New Dragon Gate Inn and 2011’s Flying Swords of Dragon Gate), the original is the best of the three. Dragon Inn also inspired the 2003 acclaimed slow cinema dramedy, Goodbye, Dragon Inn by director Tsai Ming-Liang. Goodbye, Dragon Inn is not a martial arts film; instead, it is about the last screening at a closing theater. Dragon Inn is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n11. House of Flying Daggers (2004)\n\nHouse of Flying Daggers is a wuxia romantic epic that stars Andy Lau, Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro. While it is arguably more of a romance film than a martial arts movie, it packs enough action to satisfy martial arts fans. The film follows two Tang Dynasty-era policemen who fall for a dancer rumored to be working with a rebel gang, The House of Flying Daggers.\n\nThe film received a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. Roger Ebert said of the film, “Forget about the plot, the characters, the intrigue, which are all splendid in House of Flying Daggers, and focus just on the visuals.” It is available to rent on YouTube, Amazon Prime, Google Play and Apple TV.\n\n10. Iron Monkey (1993)\n\nDirected by Yuen Woo-ping and starring Donnie Yen, Iron Monkey follows an altruistic masked folk hero who must take down a corrupt governor in 1850s China. The film is another on this list that fictionalizes the life of Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung. The film is surprisingly political for the martial arts genre, and a 2001 release in America edited out a lot of the political intrigue and references, which upset fans.\n\nWhile there is also a 1977 film called The Iron Monkey, the two films are not related. Similarly, Iron Monkey 2 was released in 1996 but is also unrelated to the plot of the first one. Iron Monkey was included on Empire’s list of 100 Best Films of World Cinema in 2010. It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n9. Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior (2003)\n\nThere are three films in the Ong-Bak franchise. While the second two take place in the same timeline in 1400s Siam, the first occurs in present-day Thailand. This makes for an odd franchise; however, all three films are worth watching for martial arts fans due to the fantastic fight scenes. Arguably, the best of the three, Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior, follows a man on a quest to retrieve a stolen Buddha statue from a Bangkok drug dealer. However, the film really is all about the fight scenes.\n\nDirected by Prachya Pinkaew, the film stars Tony Jaa with fight choreography by Panna Rittikrai. In many ways, the film is a return to form for classic martial arts movies. It doesn’t rely on stunt doubles or special effects; it really depends on Jaa’s Muay Thai abilities and intelligent camera work. Roger Ebert said of the film, “Did I enjoy ‘Ong-Bak’? As brainless but skillful action choreography, yes. And I would have enjoyed it even more if I'd known going in that the stunts were being performed in the old-fashioned, pre-computer way.” It is currently streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV and Peacock.\n\n8. Ip Man (2008)\n\nIp Man is a drama about the life of Ip Man, a Wing Chun grandmaster who was also Bruce Lee’s teacher. The film focuses on Ip’s life and struggles during the Sino-Japanese War. It was directed by Wilson Yip and stars Donnie Yen. It isn’t the only film about the life of Ip Man; Wong Kar-wai’s The Grandmaster is also about Man’s life, and while the acting and directing are arguably better, Ip Man is the better “martial arts” film.\n\nThe film is now part of a five-film franchise, and all of the films are surprisingly good, especially Ip Man 2 and Master Z: Ip Man Legacy (which also stars Michelle Yeoh and Dave Bautista.) Ip Man was nominated for 12 Hong Kong Film Awards, winning Best Film and Best Action Choreography. Some have called out the film's anti-Japanese sentiment; however it is still a great character study that also holds up as a martial arts film. It is currently streaming for free on Tubi, Pluto TV, Amazon Prime and Peacock.\n\n7. A Touch of Zen (1971)\n\nThis beautiful wuxia film masterfully explores feminism, transcendence and Zen Buddhism. A Touch of Zen is about an unmotivated artist and a princess on the run from a murderous general.\n\nThe film, directed by King Hu, stars Hsu Feng and Shih Chun. It won the Technical Grand Prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It became the second Chinese-language film to win an award at Cannes and was the first wuxia film to win an international film festival award. It is available to rent on YouTube, Google Play and Amazon Prime.\n\n6. The Raid (2011)\n\nThere is some debate over whether The Raid or its sequel, The Raid 2 (2014), is better. Either could easily take a spot on this list; however, the unending action of the first one is a must-watch for fans of martial arts films. The film features pencak silat, a class of Indonesian martial arts. It follows a SWAT team sent into an apartment building in the slums of Jakarta that a drug lord has taken over.\n\nThe film was directed by Gareth Evans and stars Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, Donny Alamsyah and Yayan Ruhian. The Raid premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and became a cult favorite in the U.S. In his review for the Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, “The Raid is a skull-splinteringly violent, uncompromisingly intense and simply brilliant martial arts action movie in a nightmarish and claustrophobic setting.” It is currently streaming for free on Pluto TV.\n\n5. Five Deadly Venoms (1978)\n\nFive Deadly Venoms is a classic of the genre. The film has directly inspired films like Kill Bill and Kung Fu Panda and several hip-hop projects from the Wu-Tang Clan. The film follows a man on a quest to find his dying master’s past five pupils and kill them as they have all turned evil.\n\nThe film combines martial arts with mystery and showcases five distinct fighting styles named after five poisonous animals: The centipede, snake, scorpion, lizard and toad. Five Deadly Venoms was produced by the legendary Shaw Brothers Studio and was directed by Chang Cheh. The film stars Chiang Sheng, Philip Kwok, Lo Mang, Lu Feng and Wang Lung-wei, and is currently streaming with Fandor.\n\n4. Once Upon a Time in China (1991)\n\nAnother film about folk hero Wong Fei-hung, Once Upon a Time in China, follows one man’s fight for family, love, his martial arts school, a rapidly modernizing way of life in late 1800s China and the rising tide of imperialism. The film was directed by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in China is a prime example of Hong Kong’s golden age of cinema in the 1990s and was a breakout role for Li. The film is visually grand and won four Hong Kong Film Awards. While the film lead to several sequels, the original can’t be beat. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n3. Police Story (1985)\n\nDirected, co-written by and starring Jackie Chan, the original Police Story is an incredibly fun action film while still being a good action film. Chan walks the line between comedy and impressive stunt work during the film's many action scenes. Contemporary reviews even liken Chan to silent comedians like Buster Keaton.\n\nThe film follows a cop who must clear his name after being framed for murder. Police Story feels very 1980s but that is also part of its charm. The film holds a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and often appears on Best Action movie lists. There are seven movies in the Police Story franchise, and they vary in quality. While the original is arguably the best, Police Story 3: Supercop (which features Chan teaming up with Michelle Yeoh for some of the best action scenes in the franchise) and Police Story 2 (which adds emotional depth to the series) are excellent films in their own right. Police Story is currently streaming on Max.\n\n2. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\nA true wuxia martial arts epic, Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is probably the most beautiful film on this list. Set in a stylized version of the Qing Dynasty, it follows a warrior, his lover, a princess and a thief after a 400-year-old sword is stolen.\n\nThe film stars Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen. It was nominated for 10 Oscars, winning four, including Best Foreign Language Film. Lee also received a Golden Globe for Best Director. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon often feels like a comic book with larger-than-life action, but that is part of what makes it great. It is currently streaming on Max.\n\n1. Enter the Dragon (1973)\n\nOne of five films starring Bruce Lee released posthumously after his sudden death in 1973, Enter the Dragon is arguably one of the coolest films ever made. Enter the Dragon is a hugely influential work in both the martial arts genre and action films more generally.\n\nIn the film, Lee plays a martial arts instructor who is asked by British Intelligence to take down a drug dealer by infiltrating the dealer’s headquarters during a high-level kung fu competition. The film stars Lee, John Saxon and Jim Kelly and was directed by Robert Clouse. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” It is currently available to rent on YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV and Amazon Prime.\n\nBottom Line"
