Fox, David Carradine\n\nBy Sonja Oliver\n\nAhh…I love the blood, violent women and sickeningly sweet twists and turns that can only be the product of Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s perverted mind.\n\nThe writer/directorâ€™s newest ultra-violent film, Kill Bill Vol. 1, follows the bloody, vengeful path of The Bride (Thurman). Sheâ€™s a betrayed member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (the Divas,) and after nearly dying from a brutal beating and shooting delivered by her former lover and squad leader, Bill, sheâ€™s pissed and looking for retribution.\n\nWielding a bad attitude, sharp teeth, a samurai sword and just a touch of mercy in all the right places, The Bride takes on her female rivals (Liu, Hannah and Fox) one by one. Divided into â€œchapters,â€ Kill Bill follows The Bride and her deadly encounters with situational flourish, ending in an intense showdown with O-Ren Ishii (Liu,) head of Tokyoâ€™s mafia and one of the most evil bitches youâ€™d ever expect to meet.\n\nTarantinoâ€™s departure from penetrating dialogue gives way to the pure spectacle of blood, severed limbs and a swath of corpses that overwhelm Kill Bill without sacrificing entertainment or his brand of spectacular, original filmmaking. The movieâ€™s insane cinematography mingles the flavors of various film genres, including Japanese anime, with satisfying bloodthirst. Following his typical recipe of non-linear narrative, Tarantino delivers an easier plot to digest, without having to swallow a few Excedrin afterward due to brain overexertion.\n\nIn typical fashion, the soundtrack will become a favorite among the movieâ€™s fans with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan overseeing the bulk, along with several offbeat and quirky vintage songs and film excerpts rounding out the track list.\n\nAs you might have guessed from the title, Kill Bill Volume 1 leaves you with an open door to anticipate Volume 2, which mercifully is expected in theatres by February."
