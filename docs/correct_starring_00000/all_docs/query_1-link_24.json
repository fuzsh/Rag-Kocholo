And now looking across at each other, the two women see the other for the first time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as bitches...but as sisters.\n\nElle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls to her knees in front of The Bride....\n\n...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg.\n\nThe Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.\n\nOnly in death do they find the sisterhood that could have been theirs."
