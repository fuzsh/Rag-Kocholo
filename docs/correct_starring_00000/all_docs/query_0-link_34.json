Starring starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah this movie quickly developed cult status among new audiences and lived up to Tarantino’s grindhouse following. Hard to spot in the photo but this poster is designated foil due the featured silver metallic sword. “Here comes the bride”.\n\nNear mint rolled and double sided.\n\nCondition C9– Sold $305 Linen Backed\n\nSorry this poster has been sold. To inquire whether we have another not yet uploaded to the website or to request us to search for one please <Contact Us>\n\nLinen Backing a poster on canvas requires three essential elements; Linen which is marketed as Cotton Duck:, acid free Japanese Lining paper and a Wheat starch solution containing an alkali buffer which when used together provide a stable acid free environment for mounting a poster.\n\nLinen backing is first and foremost a preservation and stabilization technique. It preserves the integrity of old and valuable paper and assures the poster can be safely handled and displayed."
