        "text": "Since making a splash 20 years ago in, er, Splash, Daryl Hannah has moved in some unexpected directions. She was a lethal android in Blade Runner, starred opposite Steve Martin in Roxanne and played dowdy in Steel Magnolias. She has also appeared in a notable string of independent movies, Dancing At The Blue Iguana and Northfork among them. Cast as Elle Driver in Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 she is the one-eyed member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad most determined to eliminate The Bride before she fulfils the promise of the titles.\n\nYour showdown with Uma makes for a spectacular fight, with some pretty dirty tricks being pulled by both parties. How was it to shoot?\n\nThere was one part near the end that was unchoreographed, when I was flailing around in the bathroom. You know when you get a rush of adrenaline? I'd heard stories about mothers lifting cars off of children and stuff like that, but somehow when I was doing that I went berserk in there. I broke the toilet in half, knocked the sink off the wall, the shower rod came down on my head, the mirror got smashed. I was definitely battered and bruised at the end of it, but I figured it would be pretty fun so it was alright.\n\nTarantino gives every impression that he'd appreciate that level of commitment. How is it being directed by him?\n\nIt's kind of like working with a hyperkinetic, 13-year-old, one-man film school. A mad genius brat who's having the greatest time of his life. When he's shooting he's at his most euphoric, he's so excited and he brings that to the set and it's contagious to everybody. Working on a film with him is hard work but really fun, it's totally demanding and totally wild. And he surrounds himself with the best of the best so that's a great experience too, working with the best cinematographer, the best props guys, the best sound guy. Everybody was great.\n\nSome of the actors found they were wearing their own clothes in character, after Quentin got the costume department to raid their wardrobes. How about you?\n\nOh yeah, like I have my own fetish nurse costume! I did get to keep an eye patch though, just for fun. That's in my costume box at home.\n\nWhere do you stand on the issue of film violence and censorship?\n\nIf you don't like it, then don't go and see it."
