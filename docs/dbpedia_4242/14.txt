Description:

Mealybugs are insects in the family Pseudococcidae, unarmored scale insects found in moist, warm climates. They are considered pests as they feed on plant juices of greenhouse plants, house plants and subtropical trees and also act as a vector for several plant diseases.

Habitat:

Unfortunately in my garden.

Notes:

It loves the papayas and will kill the plant if it is not kept under control. Sucks the life out of it! Would love any info about how to control this as naturally as possible.
