        "text": "Mealybugs, pesky invaders of our indoor and outdoor green spaces, are among the most common and persistent pests that gardeners and plant enthusiasts encounter. Despite their diminutive size, these tiny insects can wreak havoc on our beloved plants if left unchecked. They can impede plant growth and cause leaf discoloration. They can also cause leaves, fruits, vegetables, and flower buds to prematurely drop.\n\nAs they feed, mealybugs excrete honeydew, a sugary waste substance that attracts ants, yellow jackets, and other insects. The sticky liquid drips on foliage, hardscape, outdoor furniture, and cars. Subsequently, the fungal disease sooty mold grows on the honeydew and creates dark blotchy marks on foliage and branches.\n\nMealybugs, members of the Pseudococcidae family, are soft-bodied insects typically found in warm and humid climates. The females are small, ranging from 1/20 to 1/5 of an inch in length, with a distinctive cottony or mealy wax covering that gives them their name. This white, powdery substance often obscures their actual body, making them appear fuzzy or fluffy. The males are short lived, tiny, winged, fly like insects that never feed and therefore are inconsequential (well, at least on this page).\n\nWhere they come from:\n\nHow these pests spread around the garden or appear in your house is somewhat of a mystery; mealybugs are essentially immobile. In the garden, they fall from a trees and blow about, are carried in on birds or clothing, or hide within improperly composted mulch. Inside the home, they can blow in through an open window, hitch a ride in on your clothing, or come as a passenger on a pet.\n\nLet’s not forget ants. Ants are very industrious and will actually “farm” them, moving them about the home and garden, as they intentionally harvest the honeydew to feed the colony.\n\nFavorite Plants:\n\nMealybugs are not particularly picky eaters and can infest a wide variety of plants, both indoors and outdoors. However, they do show preferences for certain species, including succulents, citrus trees, orchids, ferns, and various houseplants. These pests thrive in plants with tender foliage or new growth. They are primarily found in colonies on perennials, woody shrubs, citrus, and indoor plants. Mealybugs especially like tender new growth and are often found in protected areas between closely hanging fruit, leaf and stem joints, plant crowns, and trunk forks."
