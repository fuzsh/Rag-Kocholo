        "text": "The genetic and morphological differentiation of insect populations in relation to the use of different host plants is an important phenomenon that predates ecological specialisation and speciation in sympatric conditions. In this study, we describe the morphological variation of populations of Brevicoryne brassicae (Homoptera: Aphididae) associated with two host species, Brassica oleracea and Brassica campestris, which occur sympatrically in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. The study is aimed at obtaining evidence regarding phenotypic differentiation induced by, or associated with, the use of distinct but closely related host species. Seven morphological characters were measured in 696 wingless aphids collected from plants of the two host species at four localities. Morphological variation was summarised through principal components analysis (PCA). Sixty-two percent of morphological variation was explained by the first two PCs. The first component (PC1) was related to the general size of appendages, and PC2 was interpreted as the relationship between body size (body and leg size) and antenna length. Aphids growing on B. campestris were bigger than those collected from B. oleraceae. Significant differences between hosts were detected for PC1, whereas a significant effect of locality, host, and the interaction locality × host was detected for PC2. These results indicate that the average phenotype of B. brassicae individuals inhabiting different host-plant species differs as a consequence of the contrasting feeding environments the host species provide.\n\n1. The reproductive fitness of a parasitoid depends on its mating and ovipositing success. Virgin haplodiploid females can reproduce, but produce only males, and may diminish fitness by producing more male offspring than required. Therefore, females must decide on whether to mate or oviposit first.2. This study was conducted to assess the mating versus ovipositing decision and its impact on the reproductive fitness of Diaeretiella rapae (Hymenoptera: Aphididae), an endoparasitoid of the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae).3. When newly emerged females were given a choice between mating and ovipositing, about 62% of D. rapae females preferred to mate before ovipositing. Those females who oviposited before mating parasitised only 10% of the available aphids. After mating, females superparasitised their hosts with fertilised eggs, which resulted in a highly female-biased sex ratio in the offspring.4. Mating success was very high (91%) in the presence of hosts (cabbage aphid nymphs) compared with that in the absence of aphids. However, mating success was not influenced by the quality (size) of the hosts present in the mating arena, despite a parasitoid preference for larger hosts during oviposition. The time between pairing and mating was also shorter in the presence of host aphids. The mean number of aphids parasitised and the parasitism rate were significantly greater after mating.\n\nThe biological parameters of cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) was studied in the laboratory conditions under the three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 ºC), RH 60±5% and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (L: D) using 40 first instar Nymph s. Among Nymph s, 40%, 55% and 10% of them completed their Nymph al period in 20, 25 and 30 ºC, respectively and developed to adult stage. In 30 ºC, the most biological acitivities of aphid were disrupted and the most individuals (Nymph s and adults) were killed. Most developmental periods, ..."
