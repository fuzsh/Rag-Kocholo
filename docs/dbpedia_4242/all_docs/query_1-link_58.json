They have been divided into the most inclusive of the taxonomic groups, called phyla (singular phylum) from the Greek phylon, meaning tribe or race. For examples, animals with a backbone, insects, snails, starfish, earthworms, roundworms, flatworms, jellyfishes, sponges, and amoebae are members of different phyla.\n\nThe members of each phylum have certain common characteristics. The largest phylum, Arthropoda, includes animals having a segmented body, bilateral symmetry, paired, jointed appendages, usually terminating in claws, a chitinized exoskeleton secreted by the epidermis and molted periodically, striated muscles, a tubular alimentary canal, a ventral nervous system, and a dorsal heart.\n\nWithin a phylum there are smaller groups of animals called classes, which also have common characteristics that distinguish them from other groups. This is evident by merely recalling the common names of representative animals in the different arthropod classes, such as crayfish, crabs, lobsters, and sowbugs (Crustacea); centipedes (Chilopoda); millipedes (Diplopoda); spiders, mites, ticks, scorpions, and harvestmen (Arachnida); insects (Hexapoda); and several others; each group brings to mind a distinct image.\n\nSome of the arthropod classes contain economically important pests, and will therefore be briefly characterized in the present section merely to present in one place an over-all view of the phylum. They will be discussed further, in detail depending on their importance, in appropriate chapters and sections of this book. Within a class there are groups of animals called orders, with common characteristics that distinguish them from other groups. Again, the common names of representative groups of animals give a good idea of what is meant by the term. For example, in the class Arachnida are the spiders (Order Araneida) and related orders: scorpions, whip scorpions, pseudoscorpions, sun spiders, harvestmen, and the ticks and mites (figure 35). In the class Hexapoda are such important orders as silverfish, cockroaches, crickets and their allies, termites, thrips, lice, bugs, butterflies and moths, beetles, flies, fleas, and the bees, wasps, and ants. Each order has clearly evident similarities among its families, and each is different in important ways from the other orders.\n\nDirectional Orientation\n\nCertain terms are used in biology to designate the various regions of an organism. The following terms will be found to be useful: anterior, at or toward the front; posterior, at or toward the hindmost part; dorsal, of or pertaining to the upper surface; ventral, of or pertaining to the undersurface; proximal, the part of an appendage nearest the body; distal, the part of an appendage farthest from the body; caudal, pertaining to the posterior or anal extremity; also, many words, such as lateral, marginal, etc., which are self-explanatory.\n\nIn description, one may employ adjectives formed from such words as thorax, abdomen, and pleuron--thoracic ganglia, abdominal appendages, and pleural regions.\n\nCLASS CHILOPODA (CENTIPEDES)\n\nThe centipedes (figure 342, chapter 10) are the closest relatives of the insects for, like the insects, they have a single pair of antennae, breathe by a series of tracheae, and the reproductive organs open at the posterior end of the body. The body is flattened, and consists of 15 to 173 segments, each with a single pair of legs except the last two and the one just behind the head. The segment in back of the head bears a pair of ventral venom-secreting claws called maxillipeds, with which centipedes kill their prey. The antennae are moderately long, and consist of at least 12 segments.\n\nCentipedes in the United States cause a wound that may be painful, but is seldom serious (see under \"Centipedes\" in chapter 9). The larger species of Scolopendra in tropical countries may reach 30 cm in length, and the amount of venom issuing from their claws is very painful and even dangerous to man.\n\nCLASS DIPLOPODA (MILLIPEDES)\n\nMillipedes (figures 342 and 343, chapter 10) differ from centipedes in that almost every segment bears 2 pairs of legs, the body is cylindrical instead of flattened, there are no venom-bearing claws, the antennae are short, and the reproductive organs open far forward on the body. Millipedes crawl slowly, whereas centipedes crawl rapidly. On the seventh segment of the male, one or both pairs of legs are modified as copulatory organs. A pair of scent glands on each segment, opening laterally, discharge a repugnant secretion. In some species, it can be discharged to a distance of nearly a meter and, in the case of some tropical species, has caused blindness in children (Hegner and Engemann, 1968).\n\nCLASS ARACHNIDA\n\n(Spiders, Mites, Ticks, Scorpions, Whip Scorpions, Pseudoscorpions, Solpugids, and Harvestmen)\n\nMost of these arthropods are terrestrial forms, although a few mites are aquatic. They have tracheae or book lungs for breathing, simple eyes (ocelli), no antennae or wings, and have 4 pairs of thoracic legs. They have a chitinous exoskeleton, and the body is divided into 2 portions--an unsegmented cephalothorax and an abdomen. The cephalothorax may be broadly joined to the abdomen or joined by a narrow pedicel.\n\nArachnids (figure 207, chapter 9) have 6 pairs of cephalothoracic appendages. The first pair, the chelicerae, are either 2- or 3-segmented, and may bear pincers for holding and crushing prey. However, they may also serve as venom-bearing fangs, intromittent organs for transferring sperm, or spinnerets. The second pair of appendages are 6-segmented, and are called pedipalps. These may also serve as intromittent organs, as pincers, for crushing food, as sensory organs, or for other functions.\n\nArachnids have 4 pairs of walking legs, usually 7-segmented. Each leg is composed of a coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and tarsus (figure 207, chapter 9). Most arachnids are carnivorous, but because they have no mandibles, they commonly predigest their food in the mouth and then suck the juices into the stomach. Some species crush their food with their chelicerae. The black widow spider cannot crush its prey, but pierces it and injects a digestive fluid, then sucks out the digested food. Spiders breathe by means of \"book lungs\" (from 1 to 4 pairs) or tracheae, or sometimes both. Arachnids are oviparous, except for the scorpions and certain mites. There are 11 orders of living arachnids, of which 7 will be considered of more or less importance as household pests, although some are harmless and are of interest only because they may be confused with bona fide pests.\n\nOrder Araneida (Spiders)\n\nWhereas the body of an insect is divided into 3 parts--head, thorax, and abdomen--as has just been noted, the body of the spider is divided into 2 parts, the head and thorax being intimately fused into a cephalothorax and the abdomen being usually soft, rounded, and unsegmented (figure 35). The cephalothorax and abdomen are separated by a narrow pedicel, as is also true of some other arachnids, including the solpugids and whip scorpions. The cephalothorax of spiders is provided with a dorsal, hardened shield or carapace, which bears the simple eyes (ocelli) at the front end. The eyes are usually arranged in 2 rows of 4 each, but there may be fewer eyes or none at all.\n\nIn the spiders, the female pedipalps (figure 207 [palpus], chapter 9) are short and leglike, but in the males they have become modified to form copulatory organs. The last segment is enlarged and knoblike, and is used for transfer of sperm. The spiders are the only arachnids in which the chelicerae are provided with venom glands that open at the tip of the fang. In some spiders, these glands are located entirely within the chelicerae, and in others they extend backward into the first section of the cephalothorax, as diagrammatically illustrated in figure 208, chapter 9.\n\nThe organs of respiration consist of leaf-like external book lungs, or book lungs and tracheae. Most spiders have 1 pair of book lungs, but tarantulas have 2 pairs. They open on the ventral side of the abdomen as slit-like clefts. If a tracheal system is present, the spiracle is usually located just in front of the spinnerets.\n\nMost spiders spin silken webs. The webs are spun from as many as 6 spinnerets, which are transformed vestigial legs and are located ventrally near the tip of the abdomen (figure 207, chapter 9). Webs may serve as nests or as traps for prey. A spider's silk must serve the dual purpose of transporting her to any part of the web, and also of trapping insect prey. She may have to secrete 2 kinds of web, dry and sticky, supplied by different glands in her abdomen. (Other glands supply the strong webbing for her egg sac.) For example, in the orbweaver's web, the central \"lookout,\" where she spends most of her time, and also the \"spokes\" that radiate to the outer rim of the web, consist of dry webbing over which she can run rapidly, upside-down, aided by hooks, toothed claws, and bristles at the ends of her legs. She avoids the sticky threads that join the spokes and are for the purpose of catching the insect prey. She can perceive the slightest disturbance of any part of the web, her highly developed tactile sense compensating for her poor eyesight. After reaching her prey, the spider quickly envelops it in fresh threads, and bites it with her sharp upper jaws, injecting a venom that quickly kills it (von Frisch, 1960).\n\nAfter the prey dies, the threads of the web entangling it are severed, and the prey is transported to the central \"lookout\" and hung up by a short thread. To consume her victim, the spider bites it, meanwhile secreting a digestive fluid, then sucks up the dissolved contents together with the digestive fluid. Dissolved muscles and intestines of the prey are imbibed within a few hours, and the indigestible remnants are dropped out of the web (von Frisch, 1960).\n\nWebbing may also be used for transportation when it is borne aloft by air currents. Gertsch (1949) made the interesting observation that although spiders were wingless, a young spider (spiderling) could float its threads on the breeze, often reaching tremendous heights and sailing for long distances, thus colonizing new areas at a rate not possible even for winged insects. He stated that the rigging of ships 320 km from the nearest land had been \"showered with tiny aeronauts riding on silken streamers.\"\n\nSome spiders do not spin true webs, but live in burrows (trapdoor spiders) or crevices (wolf spiders).\n\nThe courtship and mating of spiders is so strange and complicated as to be almost beyond belief. They are described in great detail in W. J. Gertsch's fascinating book, American Spiders (Gertsch, 1949). Soon after he becomes mature, the male spider transmits some seminal fluid to a delicate web which he has spun. He then collects the sperm and stores it in bulbs of his pedipalps (palpi) until the opportunity for mating arises. Herms et al. (1935) observed the sperm-induction procedure in the mating of black widow spiders and the courtship and copulatory behavior of that species, lasting over 2 hours. This was described in detail by McGrone and Levi (1964). Most bizarre is the sperm-induction sequence practiced by tarantulas. It is so complicated and replete with ritual that it sometimes requires 3 or 4 hours (Gertsch, 1949).\n\nSpiders are predators, mostly on insects ensnared in their webs. A few species are very venomous. In the United States, the bite of the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider or related species may be very painful, and can lead to serious general systemic disturbances, or even death. The aid of a physician should be obtained as soon as possible.\n\nOrder Acarina (Mites and Ticks)\n\nThe body divisions of the Acarina do not correspond to those of other arachnids, for the head, thorax, and abdomen are fused together, forming an unsegmented body (figure 35). This fact has resulted in a special terminology. The gnathosoma or capitulum represents the first 2 primitive segments, and bears the chelicerae and pedipalps. The idiosoma includes the rest of the body. Many mites have transverse, fine lines, but these have no relationship to segmentation. The appendages of most Acarina are somewhat similar to those of spiders, except that the newly hatched young have only 3 pairs of legs. (Mites of the family Eriophyidae have only 2 pairs.) Most mites have a tracheal system opening through 1 to 4 pairs of spiracles, located near the bases of the appendages in the anterior half of the body. Some species have no tracheae, and obtain oxygen by diffusion through the cuticle. The majority of species are oviparous (egg-laying), but some are ovoviviparous, the eggs hatching within the body of the female. There are 4 stages in the development of mites: the egg, the hexapod larva, the octapod nymph, and the adult. In each postembryonic juvenile stage, there may be 1 or more instars. Most mites are very small, and many species are pests of plants or stored food products. Other species are parasites of man and animals, and some are disease vectors or are responsible for allergies and asthma. Horsfall (1962) listed 36 genera of mites in 19 families in which there are 1 or more species of medical importance to man or domestic animals.\n\nTicks are the largest members of the Acarina They are all bloodsuckers and, when fully engorged, some species attain a length of 1 cm and a few are considerably larger. They are serious pests of domestic animals, and are the only vectors of some severe diseases of man and animals.\n\nOrder Scorpionida (Scorpions)\n\nLike the spiders, scorpions have 2 body regions, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the abdomen. However, the abdomen is segmented, and consists of a large, anterior preabdomen or mesosoma of 7 segments and a long, narrow, tail-like posterior postabdomen or metasoma of 6 segments, terminating in a vesicle or telson bearing a venomous stinger. The anterior part of the cephalothorax bears 3 groups of eyes: a median group of 2 eyes and a lateral group of 2 or 3 eyes at each margin. The cephalothorax also bears small, chelate chelicerae, large, conspicuous, pincerlike pedipalps, and 4 pairs of legs. The general body form and thornlike rigid stinger of the scorpion identify it for most people. Figure 36 shows a scorpion of the family Vaejovidae. It ranges throughout the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and is 11 to 12 cm long--the largest scorpion in the United States.\n\nScorpions breathe by means of 4 pairs of book lungs in the ventral blood sinus. Paired coxal glands, opening in the coxae of the third pair of legs, provide for excretion. They do not lay eggs, but give birth to active young. These climb upon the back of the mother and remain fastened by their pincers until after the first molt, nourished by yolk material stored in their bodies. All scorpions are venomous, but most species are not dangerous. In Arizona, however, there is a species that has caused more deaths over a 36-year period than all other venomous animals of that state, including rattlesnakes (see chapter 9, Opening paragraphs).\n\nOrder Pedipalpida (Whip Scorpions)\n\nIn this order, the cephalothorax bears 8, the chelicerae are small, 2-jointed, and chelate; and the pedipalps are strong, and have 6 joints (figure 35). In many species, the last 2 segments of the pedipalps are modified to form pincers used in seizing prey, tearing it apart, then passing it to the chelicerae to complete the maceration. The first pair of legs are not for locomotion. These legs are very long, and the long, many-segmented tarsi are used as feelers. These harmless arachnids are nocturnal, hiding during the day beneath leaves, rocks, or logs, usually in damp places, although there are a few desert species (Storer and Usinger, 1957; Barnes, 1963).\n\nThere are 2 suborders. In the Uropygi, there are 2 glands that open one on each side of the anus and discharge a stream of fluid when the animal is irritated. This fluid has the odor of vinegar, which suggested to the Spanish-speaking settlers of the Southwest the name vinagrón (from the Spanish vinagre), later modified to \"vinegarroon\" in English. The last abdominal segment bears a flagellum, which is very long with some species. The body length may range from only 2 mm to as much as 6.5 cm, as in Mastigoproctus giganteus (Lucas) (figure 37), which occurs in the southern United States from coast to coast. (The whip in this species can be twice as long as the body proper.) Mastigoproctus giganteus gets water from its prey and by drinking from a moist substrate which is located by the sensitive, antenniform forelegs. The whip scorpion probably does not have a protective epicuticular wax layer, such as that possessed by insects and many other arthropods, to protect it from desiccation. At 26° C (79° F), it readily loses water to the air at relative humidities up to 95% (Crawford and Cloudsley-Thompson, 1971).\n\nIn the suborder Amblypygi, the abdomen bears neither odoriferous glands nor a whip. In the United States the principal genus is Tarantula, although it is not a tarantula, which is a large spider. Tarantula is about 2 cm long, and has been reported from California, Texas, and Florida (Storer and Usinger, 1957).\n\nOrder Chelonethida (Pseudoscorpions)\n\nThe pseudoscorpions (figure 35) are relatively small, ranging from 4 to 10 mm in length. They resemble scorpions, but have no postabdomen or stinger, and are harmless. The abdomen is 11-or 12-segmented, and is rounded posteriorly. Their conspicuously large pedipalps bear lateral claws called chelae, with a poison gland for disabling their prey. Unlike scorpions, the pseudoscorpions do not possess book lungs. They have 2 pairs of ventral tracheal spiracles on the third and fourth abdominal segments. Like scorpions, they have a pair of glands that open on the coxae of the third pair of walking legs and provide for excretion.\n\nOrder Phalangida (Harvestmen)\n\nThe harvestmen or daddylonglegs (figures 35 and 38) are distinguished most readily by their long, slender legs. When they crawl, the small body appears to be suspended from the long, arched legs. The cephalothorax is broadly joined with the short, segmented abdomen, has 1 pair of simple eyes, and a pair of odoriferous glands. The pedipalpi are leglike. A pair of tracheal tubes opens on the second abdominal sternite. A pair of coxal glands, opening on each side between the third and fourth coxae, provide for excretion.\n\nThe harvestmen easily lose their legs or parts of their legs, and cannot regenerate them. They drink frequently, and must have water readily available. They are harmless, and should not be confused with true spiders.\n\nOrder Solpugida (Solpugids)\n\nThe solpugids, also called \"sun spiders,\" are harmless to humans. They are predaceous arachnids that occur mostly in dry tropical and in warm temperate regions. Of the 200 known species, about 60 are found in the southwestern United States (Hickman. 1967).Solpugids (figures 35, 39) are most strikingly characterized by their enormous, 2-jointed chelicerae, with the pincers articulating vertically and a rounded abdomen without a tail-like post-abdomen, telson, or stinger. They do not have venom glands. The pedipalps are simple, non-chelate, leglike, and terminate in an adhesive organ. Solpugids seize their prey with their pedipalps and pass it to the chelicerae, where it is crushed. The macerated and predigested tissues of the prey are then sucked into the mouth and esophagus. Only the last 3 pairs of legs are ambulatory; the first pair is tactile. The abdomen is 10- or 1l-segmented. Paired spiracles are located between the second and third coxae and in the third and fourth abdominal segments, leading to a well-developed tracheal system. A pair of coxal glands and a pair of Malpighian tubules provide for excretion.\n\nCLASS HEXAPODA (INSECTS)\n\nThe Exoskeleton\n\nThe Head\n\nThe Thorax\n\nThe Abdomen\n\nInternal Anatomy\n\nMetamorphosis\n\nDiapause\n\nThe hexapods comprise the largest and most highly developed group in the phylum Arthropoda. Some authorities estimate that over a million species have already been described, more than all other animal species combined. Insects also occur in incredible numbers. Williams (1964) estimated a total of 1018 live individual insects on the earth at any given moment. Adult hexapods may be distinguished from other arthropods by a number of structural characteristics, including a segmented body divided into 3 regions, the head, thorax, and abdomen. Adult hexapods possess 1 pair of antennae, 3 pairs of legs, and most have 2 pairs of wings, although some have 1 pair and others none. No other invertebrates have wings. Furthermore, insects have a front lip (labrum), 1 pair of mandibles, 1 pair of maxillae, and a hind lip (labium). Their gonopore is posterior, and they usually undergo a change of form (metamorphosis).\n\nRespiration in hexapods usually takes place by means of a system of tubes called tracheae, that divide and subdivide internally until they terminate in the delicate network of tracheoles that reaches every organ, tissue, and cell of the body. Hexapods have a simple, open circulatory system.\n\nThe modern tendency is to divide the class Hexapoda into 3 subclasses. Subclass Myrientomata contains 1 order (Protura), subclass Oligoentomata contains 1 order (Collembola), and the subclass Insecta (Euentomata) contains the remaining 23 orders. This modern classification is based on the evidence that the 3 subclasses represent distinct evolutionary lines (Belkin, 1972). However, since the present work has primarily economic rather than taxonomic objectives, for the sake of convenience all orders of hexapods will henceforth be referred to as \"insects\" Like-wise, for the sake of brevity and convenience, the older concept of all Hexapoda being divided into 2 subclasses, Apterygota (primitively wingless insects without metamorphosis) and Pterygota (winged insects, with some secondarily wingless)will be retained.\n\nThe Exoskeleton\n\nThe skeleton of an insect is external. It forms a shell-like support, and provides protection for the internal organs. This outer shell is light, but very strong. This is demonstrated by the tremendous impact that an insect can withstand without injury--as, for example, when colliding with a solid, stationary object during flight. The hard material on the exterior comprises a thin covering of the entire insect known as the cuticle (figure 40). It is secreted by a single, continuous layer of living cells, the epidermis (sometimes called \"hypodermis\"), which is supported on a noncellular basement membrane. It was once assumed that the polysaccharide chitin was the main constituent of the cuticle of insects and other arthropods, and such terms as \"chitinous exoskeleton\" are often found in fairly recent literature. However, although chitin may comprise as much as 60% of the cuticle in a few cases, it may also be present in amounts as small as 1 or 2%. Arthropod cuticle may be thought of as a continuous protein layer that usually contains chitin within and waxes on the outer surface (Richards, 1947). A review of the literature on the structure of insect cuticle was prepared by Locke (1974), and a study on its chemistry was written by Hackman (1974).\n\nThe procuticle comprises the bulk of the cuticle, and is immediately above the epidermis. It is essentially a hydrophilic chitin-protein complex containing a considerable quantity of water. The outer layer of the cuticle is called the epicuticle This consists of a proteinaceous cuticulin about 1 µ in thickness, containing no chitin, and covered with a layer of lipid, usually a hard wax, averaging about 0.25 1u in thickness. This wax, and particularly 1 or more packed and oriented monolayers of it at the cuticulin-wax interface, is the principal barrier to water loss. After some insects molt, dermal glands secrete a fluid that spreads over the surface of the wax layer to forma \"cement\" that appears to be similar to shellac (Beament, 1955). Until somewhat recently, it was not known how the wax was brought to the surface of the cuticulin. Arising from the epidermal cells and extending outward through the procuticle of most insects, and sometimes into (but not completely penetrating) the overlying cuticulin are minute ducts called pore canals. By means of the electron microscope, it was shown that these canals terminated in wax canals that branched out and reached the outer surface of the cuticulin, depositing a liquid wax similar in appearance to the liquid crystalline phases of lipid water systems (Locke 1965, 1974; Gluud, 1968). By means of sorptive dusts, a sufficient amount of wax can be removed from the solidified epicuticular wax layer to cause a lethal rate of water loss, providing means of controlling some insects by nonchemical methods. (See chapter 2, under \"Dust Desiccants.\")\n\nSetae (bristles or hairs) are sensilla that arise from pits in the cuticle surface in a sort of ball-and-socket arrangement (figure 40, d). Setae are formed by 2 cells: a sensillum-forming cell (trichogen) and a socket-forming cell (tormogen) (figure 40, a, i, k) and, of course, whatever cells that give rise to the sensory nerve(s). In the pit, the cuticle (articular membrane) is relatively thin, and so is the cuticle of the seta, etc., particularly in the case of some of the chemoreceptors. Cuticles of olfactory sense hairs are perforated by many minute pores (Slifer et al., 1959; Steinbrecht and Müller, 1971). Cytoplasmic filaments, arising in the trichogen and tormogen cells, pass up through the cuticle to enter the seta, forming a cytoplasm continuum in close contact with chemicals that may be deposited on the surface of the cuticle, and thereby forming one of the pathways for entry of insecticides through the integument.\n\nThe insect cuticle does not readily decompose, but retains its original form after the insect dies, which makes possible the preservation of insects for hundreds of years with their original lifelike appearance. Thus, the mounting and preservation of insects are comparatively easy.\n\nAn insect's exoskeleton cannot be readily dissolved away by strong acids, alkalis, or solvents, but fortunately for man's attempts to control insects by means of contact poisons, it can be penetrated by solvents, surface-active materials, vapors, and gases. In fact, it can be penetrated by organic compounds of all kinds, even when they are solids and are not dissolved in a liquid solvent. Fortunately, the rate of penetration of organic insecticides into insect cuticle is much greater than into mammalian skin. Even inorganic insecticides can penetrate the cuticles of some insects, such as cockroaches, at a lethal rate. The spiracles which are openings for the tracheae, form a channel of entry for liquids of low surface tension, and for vapors and gases.\n\nFigures 41 and 42 show that insects are divided by constrictions into ring-like plates called segments Thin, flexible portions of the cuticula called conjunctivae connect the segments. These conjunctivae may be folded into the body of the insect, allowing for expansion between segments much in the manner of an expanding accordion. Other constrictions or infoldings of the cuticle called sutures run in various directions on the surface of the exoskeleton. The internal infoldings often provide points for muscle attachments. The areas bounded by sutures are called sclerites. The shape and position of the sclerites are often used in the description of species in some insect groups.\n\nIn addition, the hairs, spines, setae, ridges, and other exoskeleton structures are used in taxonomy. External structures may be merely projections of the cuticle, or they may be associated with the underlying body structures, such as the sense organs.\n\nThe dorsal or upper face of each segment is called the tergum the ventral or lower face is called the sternum and each lateral face is called a pleuron. Each of these faces is made up of 1 or more sclerites. The dorsal part of a segment may be called a tergiteand the ventral part a sternite - terms usually restricted to the abdomen (figure 42).\n\nIf reference is made to the thorax, the term notum is generally employed instead of tergum. Thus, one refers to the dorsal part of the first segment of the thorax as the pronotum but the corresponding part on the ventral area as the prosternum.\n\nMolting\n\nAn insect can increase in size during the molting process until the hardening cuticle restricts further expansion. At molting, the old cuticle is largely dissolved by special molting fluid secreted by glands or by the epidermal cells in general. New, soft cuticle is deposited beneath the remnant of the old cuticle. The old, chemically weakened cuticle is split by internal blood and air pressure and muscular action, the split occurring along some specific line of least resistance which differs in its location among the various insect species, but frequently is along the top of the thorax and head. In figure 43, a cockroach (Blatta orientalis) is shedding its old skin (black). The insect is white immediately after molting, but becomes black within a few days. Molting appears to be a difficult and laborious process, and is a critical period in the life of an insect. The old cuticle cast off by an insect is called the \"cast skin\" or exuvia.\n\nThe Head\n\nEyes\n\nAntennae\n\nMouthparts\n\nThe head appears to comprise a single segment, but embryological observations indicate that it is a fusion of 5 or 6 segments possessed by primitive insect progenitors. The arrangement of the skeletal features of a cockroach's head is fairly well defined and will, therefore, be used as a generalized model. As seen from figure 44, the principal external regions of the head are designated as vertex, front or frons, gena, clypeus, and labrum. The eyes, antennae, and mouthparts are borne on the head.\n\nEyes\n\nAn adult insect usually possesses both compound and simple eyes. The compound eyes are among the most characteristic features of adult insects. They are composed of many small, hexagonal lenses or facets fitted closely together. Each facet is the exposed face of an independent lens and an independent eye unit called an omrnatidium. Depending upon the species, there may be from 50 to 30,000 ommatidia in a single compound eye.\n\nBesides the 2 compound eyes, an adult insect usually has 3 simple eyes or ocelli, but may have 2,1, or none, depending upon the species. Simple eyes have only a single facet. The larvae of some orders of insects, such as the flies, beetles, butterflies, and ants, never have compound eyes. They may have from 1 to 6 or more simple eyes on each side of the head. Sometimes, several simple eyes form a cluster. Nymphs of bugs, grasshoppers, and dragonflies may have compound eyes.\n\nInsects cannot change the focus of their eyes (accommodation), and they have no protection equivalent to the eyelids and eyelashes of vertebrates. Protection is afforded by the cuticle that covers the entire insect body, and which continues in an unbroken sheet over the eyes. Over the eye surface, however, the cuticle is thin and transparent, admits and refracts light, and is curved to form a lens.\n\nAntennae\n\nThe antennae of insects are extremely variable in form. Various names, for the most part self-explanatory, have been more or less generally accepted to designate the different types of antennae: setaceous (bristlelike), filiform (thread-like), moniliform (beadlike), serrate (sawlike), pectinate (comblike), clavate (clubshaped), capitate (knobbed), lamellate (bearing many plates), and plumose (featherlike). Many forms of the above types, as well as miscellaneous unclassified forms, may be found among the insects.\n\nAntennae may be used as tactile organs, or may possess organs for smelling or hearing. In general, they are used as sensory aids for locating food and finding mates, and it appears that the ants use their antennae to communicate with others of their species.\n\nMouthparts\n\nInsects are divided into groups of those having chewing (mandibulate) mouthparts and those having various modifications of the primitive chewing mouthparts, including many that are used only for sucking or siphoning.\n\nChewing Mouthparts. Examples of insects with chewing mouthparts are silverfish, cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, earwigs, psocids, biting lice (Mallophaga), dragonflies, scorpionflies, beetles, beetles, ants, sawflies, woodwasps and larvae of moths, butterflies, and primitive flies.\n\nThe mouthparts of the cockroach are of a fairly generalized type, and may be used as an example of the chewing mouthparts (figures 44 and 45). The upper lip (labrum) and lower lip (labium) oppose each other in a vertical plane. The labrum is a sclerite of the head, but the labium is a true mouthpart appendage. The actual biting and chewing appendages are the mandibles and maxillae (figure 45). They operate in a horizontal plane, i.e., from side to side. The mandibles are the first pair of \"jaws\" that can be seen when the labrum and labium are removed. They are strong, heavily sclerotized, often darkened, and possess teeth and grinding surfaces. They are operated by 2 sets of muscles, one set that closes them against each other and another set that pulls them apart.\n\nThe second pair of \"jaws\" are the maxillae. As shown in the figure, a maxilla is made up of a number of parts. The part modified for tearing food apart is called the lacinia. The maxillae bear segmented sensory palps provided with tactile hairs and also organs of smell and taste. In cockroaches, chemoreceptors involved in feeding (taste) are confined to the mouth. The Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera also have chemoreceptors on the tarsi, while the Hymenoptera have similar receptors on the antennae as well as on the mouthparts (Frings and Frings, 1949).\n\nThe lower lip or labium performs a function similar to the lower lip of vertebrates. In addition, it bears a pair of sensory palps whose function is similar to those of the maxillary palps. As might be surmised from the paired palps, the labium was formed by the fusion of primitively separate appendages, the \"second maxillae.\"\n\nThe epipharynx is a sensory organ attached to the inner surface of the labrum that is believed to contain end-organs of taste and is somewhat analogous to the palate of higher animals. It is of interest principally because it becomes modified into highly specialized structures in some of the sucking insects.\n\nThe hypopharynx is a tonguelike organ that forms the floor of the mouth cavity. The salivary duct opens in a pocket between the hypopharynx and the labium. The mouth opens between the hypopharynx and labrum.\n\nVarious Types of Sucking Mouthparts. Chewing mouthparts are the most primitive type, from which the various sucking types have evolved to form various interesting structural modifications. Sucking mouthparts are thus thought to be homologous with chewing mouthparts, even though they usually differ greatly both in appearance and function. The following types of sucking mouthparts among adult insects are distinguished by Metcalf et al. (1962).\n\nThe rasping-sucking type of mouthparts is possessed by the thrips. This type is considered by some authorities to be intermediate in structure between the chewing and piercing-sucking types. The mouthparts of thrips are somewhat asymmetrical, the right mandible being vestigial. The styletlike left mandible and the maxillae can be protruded through a circular opening at the conical apex of the head. To extract plant juices, a thrips thrusts its head downward and backward in the manner of a pickax, the stylets piercing the leaf or fruit cuticle. The plant sap is then withdrawn through the mouth cone which, when closely pressed to the plant surface, can probably provide considerable suction.\n\nThe piercing-sucking type of mouthparts is characterized by a tubular, usually jointed, beak, which encloses the stylets (figure 46, A). The stylets are modifications of the mandibles and maxillae of the chewing insects, sometimes supplemented or replaced by the labrum-epipharynx and hypopharynx. There are several subtypes of the piercing-sucking mouthparts, namely, the \"bug or hemipterous subtype\" (figure 46, A, B); the \"louse or anoplurous subtype\" (figure 46, D); the \"common biting-fly or dipterous subtype [including in the latter the mosquitoes (figure 46, H) and horse flies (figure 290, chapter 9)]; the \"special biting fly or muscid subtype\" [including the horn fly and stable fly (figure 46, F, G) and tsetse fly (figure 46, E)]; and the \"flea or siphonapterous subtype\" (figure 46, C). Figure 47 shows the successive stages in the insertion of the feeding bristles (mandibular and maxillary bristles) of the mouthparts of a bug (Hemiptera), according to Snodgrass (1935).\n\nThe sponging type of mouthparts is illustrated by the house fly (figure 46,1), blow flies (figure 46, J), and others. In such flies, the end of the fleshy, elbowed, and retractile labium is specialized into a pair of large, spongelike organs, the labella. The labella contain many furrows or channels called pseudotracheae, through which liquid material is drawn, possibly by capillarity. Liquid food is drawn up from the pseudotracheae through the food channel into the esophagus. It is usually n- possible for insects with mouthparts of this type (nonbloodsucking Muscidae, Syrphidae, and many other Diptera) to pierce the skin, but some have labellar teeth with which they can abrade the skin, e.g., the eye gnats (Hippelates).\n\nIn the siphoning type, found in the adult Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), the proboscis is derived almost entirely from the galeae of the maxillae of the more primitive mandibulate insect. The 2 elongated maxillae fit together to form a tube which, in the resting position, is coiled and held close to the underside of the head (figure 48). The labial palpi are often large and conspicuous. Except for a few species, notably the fruit-piercing moths of some tropical countries, moths and butterflies cannot pierce the epidermis of animals or plants. They usually feed by uncoiling the proboscis and sucking exposed liquids, such as nectar, through it. Muller (18~3) illustrated the proboscis of a sphingid moth from Brazil found to be 11 in. (28 cm) long, and called attention to the fact that Darwin had predicted that a moth with such a long proboscis must exist in order to pollinate certain orchids with flowers of this length.\n\nIn the chewing-lapping type of mouthparts (figure 49), illustrated by the bees and wasps, the mandibulate origin of the labrum and mandibles is readily recognizable. The mandibles may be modified to serve as tools for a variety of tasks performed by the various species possessing such mouthparts. The maxillae and labium are elongated, forming a long tongue which is of great importance in feeding.\n\nThe type of mouthparts possessed by the adult insect does not necessarily indicate the type possessed by the young of the same species. Because of their gradual or incomplete metamorphosis, in the majority of the more primitive orders of insects the adults have mouthparts of much the same appearance and function as those of the immature forms. The principal orders of this type are the Protura, Thysanura, Collembola, Orthoptera, Isoptera, Dermaptera, Psocoptera, Thysanoptera, Phthiraptera, and Hemiptera. (However, in the Coleoptera, with complete metamorphosis, larvae and adults have chewing mouthparts.) In the Odonata, Trichoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera, the mouthparts of the immature insects usually differ markedly from those of the adults. In the Lepidoptera, the mouthparts of the larvae are always different from those of the adults, the larvae having mandibulate and the adults having haustellate (sucking) mouthparts. The cocoon or attachments for the pupa of Lepidoptera are formed of silk threads spun by silk-spinning organs in the mouth of the larva. Adult Neuroptera and Coleoptera have biting mouthparts, and the immature life stages have mouthparts similar to those of the adults except that in some species (antlions, lacewing larvae, and diving beetles) the mandibles and maxillae are grooved to facilitate the sucking up of the liquids of the insects' prey after the body has been pierced.\n\nThe Thorax\n\nLegs\n\nWings\n\nThe second of the 3 body regions, called the thorax, is composed of 3 segments [In the Hymenoptera, the first abdominal segment(propodeum) is incorporated in the thorax, so the thorax is functionally (thoughly not morphologically) 4-segmented]: the prothorax, the mesothorax, and the metathorax (figure 41). In the grasshopper (figure 41) and the cockroach (figure 42), only the pronotum is visible from above; the wings cover the mesonotum and metanotum. Each thoracic segment bears a pair of legs, and in the case of winged insects, the mesothorax and metathorax bear the wings. Also, in the case of adult insects, the latter 2 segments usually each bear a pair of spiracles. The locomotory appendages of adult insects are thus confined to the thorax, but among the immature insects, locomotion may be aided by 2 to 8 pairs of fleshy, unjointed prolegs (figure 185, chapter 7) on the abdominal segments (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), or locomotory appendages may be entirely absent (as in some Coleoptera, most Hymenoptera, and most Diptera).\n\nLegs\n\nThree pairs of jointed legs are practically always present in adult insects, and are generally present in the immature stages. Nearly all adult animals having 6 legs are insects [Some adult mites of the family Tenuipalpidae (Larvacarus and Phytoptipalpus) and the males of some Podapolipodidae also have only 3 pairs of legs. (The females are frequently legless.)], and the name of the class, Hexapoda, is based on this fact. The 5 parts of the legs are held together by intersegmental membranes at the joints, and are operated by internal muscles. The 5 parts, beginning next to the thorax, are called coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, and tarsus (figure 41). These terms should be remembered, because they are often encountered in entomological literature. The trochanter in some hymenopterous species has 2 segments, and the tarsus may have 1 to 5 segments.\n\nThere are usually 2 claws on the tarsus, and there are frequently pads (pulvilli) beneath the claws that offer greater purchase against smooth objects. The ability of the pulvilli to cling to smooth surfaces is usually enhanced by many small hairs which sometimes, as in the case of the house fly, exude a sticky substance. Between the claws, there may be another type of pad or lobe called the arolium which has considerable suction force, and enables the insect to cling to objects with little or no aid from the claws. When the arolium is \"hairlike,\" as in flies, it is called an empodium. Among the thrips (Thysanoptera), the claws are very small or may be entirely absent, and the tarsus terminates in a large bladder like arolium. Among the scale insects, sucking lice, and some biting lice, there is only a single claw on the tarsus. The claws and the associated structures at the tip of the tarsus are presently considered to be a separate segment, the pretarsus.\n\nDepending on the mode of life to which an insect has become adapted, great variation can be seen in the morphology of the legs of different insect species. A rapidly running insect like the tiger beetle (Cicindelidae) will have long, slender legs, while an insect that leaps, such as a grasshopper, flea, or flea beetle (Haltica) will have enlarged femora or coxae, at least on the hindlegs. The legs of insects that dig into soil or wood are usually short and stout, and may be armed with spurs. The forelegs may be specialized for the grasping of prey, as in the case of the praying mantis and ambush bugs. Aquatic insects often have legs adapted for swimming. Arboreal insects, such as the cerambycid beetles, may have greatly expanded and hairy tarsi and strongly developed claws and pulvilli to afford the maximum grip.\n\nWings\n\nAmong invertebrates, only insects have wings, and insects are the only animals with 2 pairs of wings. Wings, like the 3 pairs of legs, are features which can be used to separate most insects readily from the many small invertebrate species with which they could be confused. Only adult insects have functional wings [The mayflies, before they become adults, molt their wings once.]. Some groups (proturans, springtails, and silverfish) appear never to have had wings in the course of their evolutionary history, while others (lice, bed bugs, fleas, some aphids, and ants; females of the mealybugs and scales; and certain lepidopterous and coleopterous families) have no wings, but had winged ancestral forms. The absence of wings in this latter group of insects does not indicate a primitive evolutionary status, but on the contrary, suggests a high degree of morphological specialization for their particular modes of existence.\n\nMost insects can flex their wings against the top of the body while they are resting, and also fold their wings if they are broad. It is usually the broader hindwings that are folded, and if they are too long, the tips may be folded under so as to be protected by the forewings. Dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata) and mayflies (order Ephemerida) lack the mechanism for flexing their wings, which are therefore held outstretched laterally or held vertically over the body. This is considered to be a primitive condition, but some of the higher insects, such as butterflies, have secondarily lost the ability to flex their wings.\n\nTypically, there are 2 pairs of wings: one pair on the mesothorax and another pair on the metathorax. The posterior pair, in the case of the true flies (Diptera), is replaced by vestigial appendages called halteres, which are believed by some entomologists to function as balancing organs. In the male scale insects, the hind pair of wings is replaced by 2 spines, 1 on each side, which hook into the weakly developed pair of wings of the mesothorax, giving the forewings added rigidity. Among the Coleoptera, the mesothoracic wings (elytra singular elytron) are horny and shieldlike. When in flight, most beetles hold their elytra to each side like the wings of a glider, depending on the membranous second pair of wings for propulsion. The second pair of wings may be longer than the first pair, but are folded away under the elytra when the beetles are not flying.\n\nThe exoskeleton and musculature of the thorax are highly developed to suit the needs of the great muscular activity involved in flight. This is most conspicuous among Odonata, Diptera, and aculeate Hymenoptera, and these insects are among the most active of the insect fliers. The wings of flies and bees move so rapidly that they become invisible.\n\nThe wingbeat frequency of one species of midge (Forcypomyia) has been recorded at 133,-080 beats per minute, or 0.00045 second per wingbeat.\n\nAn examination of the wing pads of a nymph of the lower winged insects or of the chrysalis of Lepidoptera will reveal that an insect's wing is simply a double-layered hollow sac folded out from the body wall, in the lumen of which are nerves, tracheae, and body fluid. The double-layered nature of the wings may also be easily demonstrated by placing small, adult beetles in a damp location until the wings have absorbed enough water to become bloated, thus revealing their saclike construction. The color of the wings of Lepidoptera depends on the color and arrangement of myriads of shinglelike \"scales\" attached to their wings (figure 50, right). The shingled arrangement of the scales strengthens an otherwise membranous structure that would be inadequate for rapid flight. Each scale is often strengthened by minute corrugations (figure 50, right) that diffract light rays and result in the brilliant color and iridescence usually noted in butterflies. Each scale has a pedicel at its base which serves as an anchor point. The pedicel is enlarged in the middle, and forms the \"ball\" that fits, in a fixed position, into the \"socket\" cavity in the cuticle of the wing membrane (figure 50, right).\n\nThe Abdomen\n\nMost of the segments of the third region of the body, called the abdomen, are somewhat similar in appearance (figures 41, 42). The tergites and sternites are joined by thin, membranous conjunctivae in the same way that successive abdominal segments are joined. The conjunctivae permit expansion, and the abdomen of a gravid female may be distended to fantastic proportions, as in the case of the termites.\n\nAdult insects usually do not have any abdominal appendages, except for those called genitalia, used in reproduction (figure 41, ovipositor). The genitalia are discussed in this chapter, under the heading, \"Reproductive System.\" Cerci and caudal filaments are borne on the eleventh segment of some insect species (figure 42, and figure 324, chapter 9). If 11 abdominal segments are present, the respiratory spiracles normally occur on the first to eighth segments. In many species of insects, a fusion of posterior abdominal segments takes place, and it may be impossible to recognize more than 5 or 6 segments.\n\nThe larvae of some insects have fleshy, unjointed projections of the abdomen, known as prolegs (figure 185, C, D, chapter 7), which are used as legs and are considerable aids to locomotion for some of the more elongate forms. The larvae of Lepidoptera never have more than 5 pairs of prolegs, but those of certain Hymenoptera, the sawflies (Tenthredinidae), may have 6 to 8 pairs.\n\nOrthopterans, such as grasshoppers, locusts, katydids, and crickets, that produce stridulatory sounds, have well-developed, thin, membranous tympanic organs (figure 41, tympanum) for detecting these sounds. Receptive tympanic sensilla are located on the front tibiae or the first tergite of the abdomen. Insects that lack such complex tympanic organs, such as cockroaches, can detect air movements by means of sensilla that may cover the cerci. The cerci of the American cockroach have a partly auditory function (Pumphrey and Rawdon-Smith, 1936a, b).\n\nInternal Anatomy\n\nDigestive System\n\nCirculatory System\n\nNervous System\n\nRespiratory System\n\nReproductive System\n\nMusculature\n\nThe cockroach will again serve as a generalized form of insect, this time to illustrate the internal anatomy of the subclass Insecta (figure 51).\n\nDigestive System\n\nAs already stated, the exoskeleton may be likened to a shell serving as an outer skeleton. The alimentary tract can be thought of as a tube within this outer shell, extending toward the rear from the mouth to the anal opening. This analogy is more striking in the case of the larvae of the higher insects. Between the exoskeleton and the alimentary tract is the body cavity, or hemocoele.\n\nThe alimentary canal is divided into 3 regions: the fore-intestine, the mid-intestine, and the hind-intestine. The fore- and mid-intestines are connected by the cardiac valve, and the mid- and hind-intestines are connected by the pyloric value. The fore- and hind-intestines are divided into several more or less distinguishable parts, which are well illustrated by the dissected cockroach shown in figure 51. The parts of the cockroach's fore-intestine are the pharynx (which begins at the mouth), the esophagus, the crop and the proventriculus, or gizzard. The gizzard occurs in insects that eat hard substances, and it appears to have a grinding and straining function like the gizzard of birds. The crop serves as a food reservoir, and is absent in some insects, or may be represented as a side sac, or diverticulum. The pharynx is a well-muscled pump in insects having sucking mouthparts.\n\nThe mid-intestine or ventriculus is not differentiated into regions, but a variable number of evaginations of variable size and shape and in various locations arise from it. These are called enteric or gastric caeca; and digestive enzymes may be produced in them, or they may represent additional digestive surface.\n\nIn the hind-intestine of the cockroach, the ileum, the colon, and the rectum may be distinguished. Malpighian tubules discharge into the anterior end of the hind-intestine at the pyloric region. The tubules vary in number and length, but the point at which they are attached to the alimentary canal can always be used as a means of establishing the point of juncture between the mid-intestine and hind-intestine. The functions of the Malpighian tubules are primarily to remove the waste products of metabolism (water and uric acid) from the blood stream, empty them into the hind-intestine, and adjust the ionic concentration of the blood (homeostasis).\n\nThe length and complexity of the alimentary tract of an insect species are usually related to the kind of food the insect eats. Long and complex systems are found among the herbivorous insects, while those of the entomophagous species and the insects feeding on concentrated food are relatively short and simple.\n\nCirculatory System\n\nThe \"heart\" of an insect, stated in simplest terms, is a flexible dorsal tube (figure 51), closed at the posterior end and open at the anterior end, with small, valvelike openings or incurrent ostia (sing., ostium) located along the sides of successive chambers. Blood enters the heart through the ostia as the alary muscles dilate the heart chamber, but the ostia close when circular muscles of the chamber contract, and their valvelike arrangement prevents the blood from returning to the hemocoeles or posterior chambers. Because the contractions start at the posterior chamber of the heart and pass forward, the blood is pushed anteriorly, passing through the aorta, a constricted portion of the anterior part of the heart. The blood is pumped from the aorta into a series of cavities or sinuses and veins throughout the insect. The blood bathes the \"brain,\" and from there it passes posteriorly through the hemocoeles, bathing the internal organs and passing into the appendages and wings. The circulation of the blood is aided by the contraction of a ventral diaphragm, and often by accessory hearts at the bases of legs and wings. One function of the blood is to carry digested food materials from the alimentary canal to all tissues of the body. In contact with the alimentary canal, the blood picks up the products of digestion by osmosis. While the blood is bathing the network of Malpighian tubules, waste products are removed. Insect blood has no red blood corpuscles and plays no part in oxygen transport, although the plasma of chironomid larvae does contain hemoglobin which may aid in respiration.\n\nIn the greater number of cases, both oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged directly with the external environment through the tracheal system.\n\nNervous System\n\nIn common with all arthropods, the nervous system in the body of insects is located ventrally (figure 51). Primitively paired ganglia in each segment are usually fused together, as are also the double cords connecting the ganglia. In the head, above the esophagus, lies the supraesophageal ganglion or brain, linked to the smaller subesophageal ganglion by paired connectives which pass around the esophagus.\n\nSince so much of the nervous activity of insects is on a simple receptor-effector basis, the brain does not serve as an important coordinating center as it does among the vertebrates. If the brain of an insect is removed, it may continue to live for a considerable period, and can carry on many reflex activities. If a bee is captured and confined in a transparent container (e.g., a Mason jar) when returning to the hive with a load of nectar or pollen, it will die from stress in 2 or 3 hours (Pence et al., 1963). However, the excised abdomen will live for 2 or 3 days, and has been found to be an excellent subject to monitor physiologic response to injected drugs or insecticides, free of psychogenic infuences, by means of a recently developed biosonic analyzer (Pence, 1969; Pence and Lomax, 1971).\n\nRespiratory System\n\nThe spiracles (figure 52) are the external openings of the air tubes, known as tracheae, which divide and subdivide as they penetrate to all portions of the body. The tracheae eventually divide into microscopic tubes, usually less than 1 µ in diameter, called tracheoles. These reach every cell in the body. The cells obtain oxygen and give off the waste gases of metabolism by diffusion through the walls of the tracheoles.\n\nBy microscopic examination of insect tissue, the presence of the tracheae can always be determined by the fact that they are lined with cuticula in fine, spirally arranged thickenings called taenidia, which prevent the collapse of the delicate tracheal tubes.\n\nMany insects, for example, parasitic insects spending their larval lives in the bodies of their hosts, respire through their cuticles, even though they may have a tracheal system. Some insects may live for long periods without oxygen. Wigglesworth (1939) reported an oestrid larva remaining alive 17 days immersed in oil. Specimens of California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell), have lived as long as 40 days after being placed on glass slides, covered with refined spray oil, and then sealed with glass cover slips. The majority survived under these conditions for 10 days or more. If the cover slips were not placed on the scale insects after they were bathed in oil, they became desiccated and died much more rapidly; none of them survived for a period longer than 10 days (Ebeling, 1945).\n\nReproductive System\n\nThe genitalia are the external organs of reproduction, with all their appendages. In the females they may be modified into a highly specialized exserted or retractile egg-laying organ or ovipositor. It is not present in all orders of insects, but when present it may be used to deposit eggs into the ground, into plant tissues, or into the bodies of animals. The most remarkable modifications of the ovipositor may be found in the Hymenoptera. In the hymenopterous parasites, it is greatly elongated and slender. The eggs are then compressed and stretched to an extreme degree in their passage through the very narrow channel of the bristlelike ovipositor (Fulton, 1933). In the stinging Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees), the ovipositor is modified into a stinger. The venom is ejected at the tip of the stinger, and the eggs are ejected from the opening of the genital chamber: which lies at the base of the ovipositor (Snodgrass, 1935).\n\nThe female internal reproductive organs (figure 51, and figure 53, right) consist primarily of a pair of ovaries. Each ovary normally consists of several ovarioles within which the eggs are developed. From the ovaries issue a pair of oviducts, which are usually united and lead to the vagina. There is almost always a saclike pouch called the seminal receptacle or spermatheca (figure 53), which receives and stores the sperm. Since some insects mate only once, the spermatheca performs an important function. In some insects (e.g., Lepidoptera), there is also a bursa copulatrix which receives the sperm first. The colleterial glands secrete a viscid material used to \"cement\" eggs together, waterproof them, attach them to objects, or to form envelopes that may encapsulate a number of eggs.\n\n. The number of eggs laid by an insect may vary from a few to many thousand. The queen honey bee may lay 2,000 to 3,000 eggs per day for weeks at a time, and the termite queen can lay millions of eggs. Not all insects lay eggs. Insects which lay eggs are said to be oviparous. Their eggs may be fertilized, as they pass through the vagina, by sperm stored in the spermatheca. If the eggs produced by the female bear viable offspring although the eggs are not fertilized, reproduction is said to be parthenogenetic. The developing embryo within the egg is nourished by means of the yolk, as in the case of birds. Unlike the birds, however, insects do not incubate the eggs and, in fact, rarely care for the eggs in any way after they are laid. They usually lay eggs in, on, or near food that will be consumed by the hatched young.\n\nMany species of insects give birth to active, living young. Such insects are said to be viviparous. Among such species, the production of young may also be by parthenogenesis as, for example, among the aphids. The term ovoviviparous refers to the type of reproduction in which eggs with well-developed shells hatch within the body of the female and active young are then produced. The most recent tendency is to consider that the term \"ovoviviparous\" is superfluous, because all insects lay eggs, whether these hatch within the body or, as is more often the case, they are laid by the female and hatch outside.\n\nThe males of ants, bees, and social wasps are produced from unfertilized eggs and the females and workers from fertilized eggs. The males of some parasitic Hymenoptera and aleyrodids are also produced from unfertilized eggs.\n\nIn a diagram of the male and female reproductive organs, the structural analogy can be seen (figure 53). Comparable to the ovaries are the male testes in which sperm is produced, leading to the vasa deferentia which unite to form the ejaculatory duct. Accessory glands secrete fluid with which the sperms are mixed. The external genitalia consist functionally of the genital claspers and the aedeagus, which includes the penis.\n\nThe external genitalia of the male, are used extensively in the description of species because they often show more constant and more distinct differences than any other structural characters to be found on the insect.\n\nMusculature\n\nInsects have a large number of muscles. The external skeleton allows for a large area of attachment for muscles compared to the bony internal skeleton of vertebrates. In man, there are said to be 696 muscles, but Lyonet found over 4,000 in the caterpillar of the goat moth, Cossus ligniperda.\n\nThe muscles of insects are soft, but quite strong, and they are cross-striated, alternate light and dark bands crossing the fibers. There are skeletal and visceral muscles. In the latter, the transverse striations are not so distinct as in the skeletal muscles.\n\nInsect muscles are very strong in relation to the insect's body weight. Insects are able to lift from 15 to 25 times their body weight. Their muscles contract and relax with phenomenal rapidity, as illustrated by the great speed of wing vibrations. Insect wing muscle is the most active tissue known, and consumes the most fuel and oxygen per unit of protein. The insect tracheal system facilitates the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide through muscle tissue several thousand times faster than diffusion in the liquid phase (Weis-Fogh, 1964).\n\nMetamorphosis\n\nDevelopment Without Metamorphosis\n\nGradual Metamorphosis\n\nIncomplete Metamorphosis\n\nComplete Metamorphosis\n\nThe Terms \"Instar\" and \"Stage\"\n\nDifferences Between Nymphs and Larvae\n\nSome Adult Morphological Specializations\n\nMetamorphosis means \"change in form,\" and with respect to the development of animals, it refers to change in form during postembryonic growth.\n\nIn some of the lower forms of insects, there is no change in form; in others, there are varying degrees of change, up to such striking transformations as may be observed between a grub and an adult beetle, a caterpillar and a butterfly, or a maggot and an adult fly.\n\nDevelopment Without Metamorphosis\n\nThe insects of the 3 orders lowest in the scale of evolution, the Protura, Thysanura, and Collembola, do not go through any change in form after hatching, any more than do the vertebrates. Their development is without metamorphosis (ametabolous development) (figure 54). A young silverfish or springtail, for example, appears so much like the adult that one would immediately infer that the newly hatched young and the adult are the same species. The young insect increases in size, but its shape changes very little. The 3 orders in which no metamorphosis occurs comprise the subclass Apterygota, the insects of which have no wings and are descended from wingless ancestry.\n\nGradual Metamorphosis\n\nSince no insect has visible wings immediately after birth, any insect that develops wings must undergo some degree of metamorphosis during its life history. Therefore, metamorphosis may be found among all the insects of the subclass Pterygota. These are insects that have wings in the adult stage or, if the wings are absent, they were lost during the course of evolution from winged ancestry. Cockroaches, grasshoppers, earwigs, termites, lice, thrips, bugs, aphids, and scales are representative of the insects that undergo gradual metamorphosis (paurometabolous development) (figure 55). Since the immature stages, commonly called nymphs (see the next paragraph), require about the same kind of habitat and food as the adults, internal anatomical changes during the life history of these insects are not on the same scale as for insects for which food and habitat change drastically. The most conspicuous change other than an increase in size during the development of insects with gradual metamorphosis is the difference in the appearance of the externally developed wing buds. Such insects are placed in the Exopterygota (Division A), of the subclass Pterygota later in this chapter.\n\nEuropean entomologists have not been so adamant as those in the United States in using only the term \"nymph\" for the immature stages of the paurometabolous insects. Some refer to them as \"larvae,\" or may use the term \"nymph\" for some insects (e.g., cockroaches and earwigs) and the term \"larva\" for others (e.g., thrips and scale insects). Some use the term \"larva\" for early instars and \"nymph\" for later instars of the immature forms of the same paurometabolous insects, such as the termites. European entomologists did the pioneer work on termite caste development, and used the term \"larva\" to refer to termite nymphs before they acquire wing buds and the term \"nymph\" for individuals succeeding the apterous nymphs and possessing external wing buds. For the sake of standardization, American entomologists are using the same terminology for termites.\n\nIncomplete Metamorphosis\n\nThree orders of aquatic insects, the Ephemerida (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Odonata (dragonflies), are placed by some authors in a group called the Hemimetabola, a group having incomplete metamorphosis (hemimetabolous development). These insects undergo radical changes in habitat during their life histories (figure 56).\n\nThe nymphs (naiads) and adults of insects with incomplete metamorphosis live in entirely different habitats. The aquatic nymphs have tracheal anal or rectal gills; their legs are modified for clinging, climbing, or burrowing; their bodies are modified for swimming; and their mouthparts are modified for taking food in the water. Special adaptations are required to enable the adults to escape from the last nymphal skin. The adults, being aerial, require different methods for capturing food (dragonflies and damselflies) or they may take little or no food, but inflate the alimentary canal with air to aid in flight (mayflies and most stoneflies) (Matheson, 1951).\n\nObviously, the morphological changes dependent upon a change from aquatic to terrestrial existence must of necessity be greater than those which accompany the changes occurring among insects with gradual metamorphosis, which undergo no change in habitat or food habits. The 3 orders involved are placed in a separate division of the Exopterygota later in this chapter, but this is not meant to indicate their phylogenetic relationship to other insects. An arrangement of orders according to modern concepts of phylogenetic relationships may be found in Fundamentals of Entomology, Part 1 (Belkin, 1972).\n\nComplete Metamorphosis\n\nThe higher orders of insects, including the 4 that have the greatest number of described species, the Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths), Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, bees), and Diptera (flies, mosquitoes), undergo what is known as complete, complex, or indirect metamorphosis (figure 186, chapter 7), and are placed in a group called the Holometabola (having holometabolous development). The young of insects with complete metamorphosis are known as larvae, and are so different from the adult that no one unfamiliar with their life history would suspect them of being merely a different stage in the development of the same individual. For example, what is there about the habitat, food habits, and appearance of a codling moth larva, the \"worm\" of the wormy apple, that would lead an uninformed person to suspect that it is an immature stage of the codling moth? For such radical transformations, the insects with complete metamorphosis have a life stage called the pupa, that is not possessed by any of the groups already discussed. The pupal stage is a quiescent, transient one, in which there is usually little locomotory movement and no feeding. The larva generally pupates in a place where the pupa will be hidden or inconspicuous--the pupa, being motionless, is also defenseless. A protection for the pupa is often spun, or prepared in some other way, by the larva. On the other hand, some dipterous pupae in the Culicidae and Chironomidae are very active, as evidenced by the familiar mosquito \"wigglers.\"\n\nAll activity during the pupal stage is concentrated on the complex chemical changes associated with simultaneously breaking down (histolysis) and building up (histogenesis) tissues before the insect can emerge from the pupal skin, transformed for its radically new form and life habits. For example, in the pupa of a moth, sexual organs develop, chewing mouthparts are transformed into coiled, siphoning mouthparts, wings develop, compound eyes and antennae are formed, and in general the insect whose simple, cylindrical larval form was specialized for feeding and storing energy is transformed into a highly active and sensitive organism, specialized for flying about, securing food, finding a mate, and locating a place for oviposition.\n\nOne of the advantages of complete metamorphosis is that the larvae are specialized in habits and form for feeding, growing, and storing energy, and the adults are specialized for mating, reproducing, and effecting a dispersal of the species.\n\nThe means of locomotion, sense organs, and reproductive organs that the larva did not require are now essential to the adult. In addition, the pupae may provide a means of passing through seasons of adverse weather conditions or periods of food shortage.\n\nInsects with complete metamorphosis develop their wing buds and the buds for all other adult structures internally in the larval instars. For this reason, they are placed in the division Endopterygota of the subclass Pterygota in the synopsis of orders at the end of this chapter. The buds often become external in the pupal stage, but are hidden under the pupal sheath in the case of obtect (smooth) pupae, when they are not seen until the adult stage.\n\nNeither the pupa nor the adult ever grows. The layman often supposes that a small house fly is a young fly that has not yet completed its growth. However, differences in the sizes of adults merely indicate variations in the amount of growth attained by the larvae. This, in turn, was largely dependent upon the food supply. The change of form from larva to adult never fails to excite the wonder and imagination of all people; the development of mammals, including man, appears so simple and uneventful by comparison. In fairness to the mammals, however, it should be pointed out that their greatest changes in form occur during embryonic development--changes which, in fact, recapitulate the greater part of their long and eventful phylogenetic development. The morphologic changes of the higher insects are more spectacular because they occur during the postembryonic development of the animal.\n\nThe Terms \"lnstar\" and \"Stage\"\n\nNow that some understanding has been gained of the meaning of \"metamorphosis,\" the distinction between the terms instar and stage can be more readily understood. The cuticle of an insect allows for only limited growth; for further growth, the insect must split and shed its cuticle, and this process is called molting or ecdysis. Before the old cuticle is shed, a new cuticle is already forming, and will allow for another limited increase in body size. This process usually continues until the insect becomes an adult, although in a few insects such as the proturans (Protura), springtails (Collembola), and silverfish (Thysanura), molting continues even after the adult stage is reached.\n\nAn instar is the form in which an insect appears after each molt. The period between any 2 molts is called a stadium (plural, stadia). The life stages of an insect are the periods of its life which are radically different from each other in appearance and usually also in behavior and activity, particularly so in the case of holometabolous insects. For example, a cockroach has 3 stages: egg, nymph, and adult; a moth has 4 stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.\n\nDifferences Between Nymphs and Larvae\n\nSince the naiads of aquatic insects with incomplete metamorphosis are of comparatively little interest to the majority of entomologists, the accompanying tabulation gives only the factors which differentiate nymphs and larvae (p. 112).\n\nSome Adult Morphological Specializations\n\nIn many of the holometabolous insects, the adults do little feeding; the energy supply for their relatively brief adult life is carried over from the larval stage in the fat bodies. Some females (e.g., mosquitoes and fleas) must feed in order to develop eggs. However, adult specializations are chiefly for reproduction and distribution of the species. In the higher insects, one form of specialization is sexual dimorphism. In some insects, the 2 sexes are so different that they could easily be mistaken for separate species. In others, the male may be partially or completely eliminated, and reproduction is by parthenogenesis (e.g., in aphids). In some insects, the normal adult morphological features are absent; characters of the immature stage are carried over to the sexually mature and reproducing individuals. This phenomenon, called neoteny is frequently associated with parthenogenetic reproduction and viviparity (rearing active young instead of eggs), and is restricted to the female.\n\nIn social insects, different castes perform particular functions in the colony. Information on castes and their functions can be found elsewhere n this book in discussions of the biologies of termites, ants, wasps, and bees.\n\nNYMPH\n\n1. Appearance similar to that of adult.\n\n2. Habitat and food same as for adult.\n\n3. Successive nymphal instars become progressively more like adult in appearance.\n\n4. Has no inactive stage between nymph and adult.\n\n5. wing buds develop externally.\n\n6. Has few, if any, structures different from hose of adult.\n\n7. Mouthparts same type as those of adult.\n\n8. Has compound eyes if compound eyes are possessed by adult.\n\nLARVA\n\n1. Appearance radically different from that of adult; typically cylindrical.\n\n2. Habitat and food often greatly different from those of adult.\n\n3. Last larval instar appears no more like the adult than the first instar.\n\n4. Has an inactive pupal stage for transformation from larva to adult.\n\n5. Wing buds develop internally.\n\n6. Has temporary structures, such as prolegs, not retained by adult.\n\n7. Mouthparts often different from those of adult (e.g., caterpillars, chewing; moths, sucking).\n\n8. Never has compound eyes.\n\nDiapause\n\nCommon to all forms of life, and apparently as necessary as any other life function, is the phenomenon of rest or diapause, involving various forms of cessation of activity. It may take the form of a temporary cessation of development, or temporary cessation of activity, or both.\n\nIn insects, diapause most often occurs in the gg or pupal stages, although it may occur in other stages of development. It may be caused by hanges in temperature, moisture, food, water, or oxygen. Diapause may be triggered by a engthening (vernal) photoperiod or by a shortening (autumnal) photoperiod, or may be imposed by such internal factors as heredity, enzymes, or hormones. Some believe that diapause ay be brought about by autointoxication or byhe accumulation of some chemical, somewhat like muscular fatigue in higher animals. Diapause that enables an insect to resist cold is called hibernation; if it enables an insect to resist heat or drought, it is called aestivation.\n\nCLASSIFICATION: THE ORDERS OF INSECTS\n\nBinomial Nomenclature\n\nRules of Binomial Nomenclature\n\nRelation of Scientific Names to Entomological Investigation\n\nSome Characteristics of the Phylum Arthropoda\n\nUse of Keys for Identification of Insects\n\nSimplified Key to the Principal Orders\n\nBinomial Nomenclature\n\nIt has been shown that the members of the class exapoda have in common a number of characteristics which definitely separate them from the classes of the phylum Arthropoda. Likewise, the class Hexapoda can be divided into a umber of orders, each of which includes insects with certain common characteristics that indicate more or less similar morphological and/or phylogenetic relationships. For example, there are striking points of difference noted in grasshoppers (order Orthoptera), which have 4 wings (the front pair generally thickened), chewing mouthparts, and gradual metamorphosis, as compared with the flies (order Diptera), which have a single pair of wings, sponging or piercing mouthparts, and complete metamorphosis. The various orders can usually be readily distinguished, even by relatively inexperienced students of entomology.\n\nThe orders are subdivided into families, the families into genera (sing. genus), the genera into species, and the species sometimes are subdivided into subspecies or varieties. The accompanying classification of man in comparison to that of one of his external parasites, the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer, will illustrate the significance and the relative magnitude of the various categories universally accepted in both plant and animal classification. However, only a relatively few species of insects have been divided into taxonomically distinct subspecies.\n\nMan Head Louse Kingdom Animal Animal Phylum Chordata Arthropoda Class Mammalia Hexapoda Order Primates Phthiraptera Family Hominidae Pediculidae Genus Homo Pediculus Species sapiens humanus Subspecies Caucasian capitis\n\nIn addition to the categories shown in the box, additional subdivisions have been established to facilitate the classification of certain groups whose large size or structural peculiarities make further division desirable. For example, orders may be divided into suborders, a number of families may be grouped into a superfamily, or a family may be divided into a number of subfamilies. A subfamily may in turn be divided into tribes, each consisting of a number of genera. The suffix for the name of the superfamily is \"-oidea.\" This should be distinguished from \"-odea,\" which is used as a suffix for the names of some of the orders and suborders. The suffix for the name of the family is \"-idae,\" for the sub- family, \"-inae,\" and for the tribe, \"-ini.\" Thus, one of the familiar tarantula hawks of the southwestern United States, Pepsis formosa (Say), is in the superfamily Vespoidea, family Pompilidae, subfamily Pepsinae, and tribe Pepsini (see figure 246, chapter 9.)\n\nBinomial nomenclature gives to each species of plant or animal a name of 2 terms, of which the first is the genus, and should always begin with a capital letter, and the second is the species, and should always begin with a small letter. Both terms are italicized in scientific literature, and are accordingly underscored (underlined) in manuscripts. It is a system of nomenclature first standardized by the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus about the middle of the eighteenth century. In binomial nomenclature, the name for the human species is Homo sapiens, and the name for the head louse is Pediculus humanus. There are two subspecies or varieties of Pediculus humanus: P. h. capitis, the head louse; and P. h. humanus, the body louse.\n\nSome people are inclined to think of scientific names as pedantic gestures, or of having perhaps some vague academic significance of small concern to anyone besides the taxonomist. The common names of most animals, especially insects, are highly variable, even within a relatively limited area, and may mean nothing to people in other areas within the same country, to say nothing of those in other parts of the world. Likewise, common names may give little or no indication of the taxonomic relationship of the insects another. Therefore, only the scientific have a universal significance--referring same plant or animal the world over.\n\nIn the Entomological Society of America, there is a Committee on Common Names of Insects. This committee has developed a list of approved common names of insects and a few other arthropods, and also their scientific names, according to the latest concepts of taxonomists in each insect group. This list is periodically revised, expanded, and sent to members of the society. By following the recommendations of the committee, American and Canadian entomologists are standardizing nomenclature in their published papers.\n\nThe dictionary is not always a reliable authority on common names of insects. One finds such words as \"bedbug,\" \"housefly,\" and \"honeybee.\" These should be written as 2 words--\"bed bug,'' \"house fly,\" and \"honey bee.\" The bed bug is; true bug (Hemiptera), the house fly is a true fly (Diptera), and the honey bee is a true bee (a superfamily in the order Hymenoptera). On the other hand, the words \"doodlebug,\" \"dragonfly,\" and \"silverfish\" are properly written as 1 word because the doodlebug is not a bug, the dragonfly is not a fly, and the silverfish is not a fish. The words \"bedbug,\" \"housefly,\" and \"honeybee\" would be equivalent to the word \"Johnsmith.\"\n\nRules of Binomial Nomenclature\n\nBefore the time of Linnaeus, the name of the insect was a short Latin description. It can be imagined how cluttered with names entomological literature would be if such a system of nomenclature had been retained. Linnaeus suggested that the name of an animal (or plant) be composed of the compounded names proposed for the genus and for the species of the animal in question. These were always Latin names, for Latin was the universal language among scholars of that time. Latin has an additional value for use in \"scientific names,\" in that its form and usage are now stereotyped, and can be used with unchanged meaning by people of all languages and in all parts of the world. We hear much nowadays about the desirability of a universal language. A universal language has been used for centuries by biologists in the naming of plants and animals, and if this had not been the case, the chaotic condition of biological literature would be difficult to imagine. Certainly, natural science would have been greatly retarded. Chemists are also in world-wide agreement as to chemical nomenclature, having adopted a universal system at a conference held at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1892. (While Linnaeus used only Latin, latinized forms of Greek and other languages were later often used in binomial nomenclature. Many generic names are more recently of Greek derivation.)\n\nLinnaeus grouped the insects into 7 orders: Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Aptera. He described and named a surprisingly large number of species, as a perusal of general entomological literature will show. In 834 pages, Linnaeus described 4,379 animals, including 1,937 insects. By now, about a million species of insects have been named and described, and about 6 or 7 thousand new species are being added in the world's taxonomic literature each year. There are probably at least as many species of insects still unnamed and undescribed.\n\nLinnaeus perfected the binomial system of classification, and used it in his famous general treatise on animals, called Systema Naturae. The tenth edition of this publication, which appeared in 1758, is universally accepted as the starting point in binomial nomenclature. Any specific name proposed before the date of publication of the tenth edition of Systema Naturae is not considered valid. In all the naming of species subsequent to 1758, however, the rules of priority are strictly followed. If a species is described and named, and subsequent research reveals that someone else had already described and named the same insect, the later name becomes invalid. Taxonomists are no more infallible than any other specialists, and the constant revision of initially presumed taxonomic relationships of species, genera, and families of insects to one another is a task that continues apace with the description of new species.\n\nFor complete information on a scientific name, the name of the \"author,\" the researcher who first described and named the species, follows the name of the species, but his name is not underscored or written in italics. In most entomological literature, the author's name is abbreviated. However, the modern tendency is to write out the author's name completely, since there are now too many names to abbreviate without duplication or confusion. Likewise, beginning students and those not familiar with a given insect group are not likely to know the meaning of the majority of the abbreviations. However, an abbreviation for Linnaeus or Fabricius is acceptable.\n\nThe house fly may be taken as an example to illustrate the correct form of binomial nomenclature. It is one of the many species which was named by Linnaeus. The scientific name of the house fly is Musca domestica Linnaeus (or Musca domestica Linn., or L.). One knows from the scientific name that Linnaeus described the house fly as the species domestica and that he placed in the genus Musca. Let us take another example, the codling moth of apples, pears, and walnuts, another well-known cosmopolitan insect pest. The scientific name of this insect is Laspeyresia pomonella (Linnaeus). The parentheses around \"Linnaeus\" show that he named the codling moth pomonella, but that he placed it in some other genus (Tinea). Later, a specialist in this particular group of the Lepidoptera found that the codling moth showed greater taxonomic relationships to insects which belong in the genus Laspeyresia, a genus that had not yet been recognized in Linnaeus' time. Since then, the species pomonella has actually been placed in 3 successive genera, Cydia, Carpocapsa, and Laspeyresia, the latter being currently recognized by entomologists and approved by the Entomological Society of America.\n\nRelation of Scientific Names to Entomological Investigation\n\nThe first step in investigating an insect problem is to establish the identity (scientific name) of the insect in question. If the name of the insect is not known to the investigator, or if he is not absolutely certain of its identity, he may send specimens to the United States National Museum for identification, or if he knows to what group (family or genus) the insect belongs, he may send specimens directly to a taxonomist who specializes in that particular group of insects. When he is certain of the scientific name of the insect, the investigator proceeds to examine the entomological literature for information on it.\n\nThe literature may reveal to an investigator much that is already known about an insect, such as its economic importance, geographic distribution, hosts, life history, seasonal history, habits, tropisms and ecological relationships, climatic or other physical factors favorable or unfavorable to its abundance, natural enemies, and previous investigations on control measures. The obtaining of all this wealth of information is predicated on the correct identification of the insect species and the ability to use the world's entomological literature on the basis of a standardized system of nomenclature. No matter in what country the literature originated, the insect should always have the same scientific name, for insects are named according to universally accepted standards of nomenclature. Without a universally accepted system of classification and naming of insects, no other phase of entomological investigation could be systematically pursued.\n\nSome Characteristics of the Phylum Arthropoda\n\nAs shown in the various categories of classification, the phylum is the most inclusive of the subdivisions of the animal kingdom. In the Arthropoda, the various classes (subdivisions of a phylum) share these characteristics in common: bilateral symmetry; segmented bodies; paired, jointed appendages; protective cuticle; a dorsal blood vessel; and a ventral nervous system. Some, but not all, of these characteristics are possessed by some groups of animals farther down in the scale of evolution. For example, the members of the phylum Annelida, to which the earthworms belong, possess bilateral symmetry; segmented bodies; protective cuticle; a dorsal blood vessel; and a double ventral nerve cord, segmented into a series of ganglia. However, they do not have jointed appendages. No other phylum of animals possesses all of the characteristics of Arthropoda. Within the phylum Arthropoda, however, there are some points of difference which relegate different groups of animals to different classes. The class Hexapoda, for example, is the only group of arthropods that has 3 body regions, 3 pairs of legs, and wings (as adults).\n\nUse of Keys for Identification of Insects\n\nWhen an insect taxonomist or systematist is given a large group of insects to separate into their respective orders, families, genera, and species, he first attempts to sort out the species he recognizes from earlier experience. For aid in determining the relationships of the insects of whose identification he is not certain, the taxonomist will often use \"keys,\" by means of which the insects can be traced through a successive series of morphological characters. The keys are so arranged as to facilitate the determination of scientific names and systematic relationships, and have been prepared for all the categories of insect classification. They are based on the work of a large number of specialists in the various groups of insects, and are, of course, subject to revision as new information is gained regarding the taxonomic relationships of the various groups. The use of a key depends on some knowledge of the structural characteristics and terminology of the group of animals (or plants) for which it has been worked out.\n\nThe accompanying simple and admittedly incomplete key was designed to enable students to \"key out\" the principal orders of adult insects for a course in economic entomology. The orders Protura and Collembola are included among the insects, although modern taxonomists consider them to belong to different subclasses. In this simplified key the diplurans (Diplura) are considered to be in the order Thysanura and the cockroaches are considered to be in the order Orthoptera, although the cockroaches are placed in Dictyoptera in chapter 6. Belkin (1972) has combined keys for adult and immature insects.\n\nSIMPLIFIED KEY T0 THE PRINCIPAL ORDERS OF INSECTS IN THE ADULT STAGE\n\n1.

However, as already stated, a good argument could be made for placing the Protura and Collembola in separate subclasses, Myrientomata and Oligoentomata, respectively, with the remaining orders in the subclass Insecta (Euentomata) (Belkin, 1972).\n\nSubclass I. Apterygota. Primitively wingless insects without metamorphosis.\n\nProtura. Proturans\n\nWings.None.\n\nMouthparts. Piercing-sucking, retracted into a pouch.\n\nMiscellaneous. Very small, slender, white insects. Abdomen 12-segmented or more, with a pair of appendages on the first 3 segments; tracheae may be present or absent; no visible antennae; blind. They are principally found in leaf mold. Proturans crawl only on the second and third pair of legs, holding the first pair in front of and above the head as tactile organs (figure 57).\n\nCollembola. Springtails, Snowfleas\n\nWings. None.\n\nMouthparts. Chewing type, sunken into the head.\n\nMiscellaneous. Very small to minute; compound eyes; eyes are grouped, ocelli-like. Antennae short, rarely have more than 5 or 6 segments; 6 abdominal segments, the first usually provided with a collophore (suckerlike ventral tube), the fourth usually bearing a pair of appendages that constitute the springing organ or furcula and the third bearing a pair of appendages that operate to act as a catch to hold the furcula when it is at rest; tracheal system usually absent; Malpighian tubules absent. Adults molt many times after reaching sexual maturity.\n\nThe Collembola (figures 336 and 337, chapter 10) are sometimes very abundant, and some species are injurious to plants. They may be found in mushroom beds, maple sap buckets, on the surface and in the soil of fields and woodlands wherever there is shade, and moving about on the surface of water in swimming pools, but they can be found in greatest abundance under boards or logs, where they find both darkness and moisture. They are nocturnal. The characteristic of their habits for which they are best known is their ability to spring into the air by means of their furcula, which is doubled under the abdomen and held in place by the \"catch,\" then released like a spring.\n\nDiplura. Japygids, Two-Pronged Bristletails\n\nWings. None.\n\nMouthparts. Chewing, partially retracted.\n\nMiscellaneous. Small, narrow, rarely over 10 mm in length, unpigmented because of their secluded and subterranean habits. Antennae long, filiform, with beadlike segments; eyes and ocelli absent; abdomen 11-segmented Diplurans may have long cerci with beadlike segments as in the antennae, and without"
