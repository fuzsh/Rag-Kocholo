        "text": "The formerly gorgeous green and lush leaves of your houseplants are yellowing, stunted, or even becoming deformed. Brown pockmarks appear in lines and groupings on your plant‚Äôs foliage, and you notice leaf drop. Oh no! What could be happening?\n\nThe symptoms described above could mean that your plant has ‚Äúscale‚Äù. While the term sounds like a disease, it is actually an infestation of tiny insects that adhere to the stems, branches, or leaves of your houseplant, where they live on the nutrient-rich sap found there. The name for these tiny pests (Scientists have identified more than 7,000 species of Scale) comes from their tendency to form a waxy or shell-like exoskeleton that protects the insect body.\n\nWhat is Scale?\n\nScale varies in color, shape, and size, depending on the insect, but is most often small, brown, round or oval, shell-like bumps running in groups along the stems and leaves of your plant. The rounded mounds, or domes, are hardy, tiny insects. Hundreds of eggs are laid beneath the female‚Äôs scale. In large infestations, live young are produced under the scale. Scale almost always appears in groups or clusters because the fecund females lay so many eggs, which survive prolifically. When the eggs hatch, the baby insects, called ‚Äúcrawlers‚Äù, move along the plant, find a protected place to lodge, and begin to form a shell. The life cycle of a Scale can be up to ten weeks, so these tiny pests have great potential to wreak havoc on your houseplants.\n\nPic: Hawaii Master Gardeners\n\nThere are two types of Scale: armored or hard scales; and unarmored or soft scales. A protective waxy substance covers soft scale insects. Their more penetrable exterior makes them somewhat easier to eliminate with the use of pesticides. Hard Scale is difficult to eradicate because the animal‚Äôs tough shell protects it from insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or other sprays.\n\nHow do I know if my plant has Scale?\n\nBeyond the presence of bumpy, round, and colored groupings on plant parts, you might also notice a sticky substance and a sooty, black mold that spreads on the underside of leaves. This is because scale insects produce a sugary honeydew when feeding on the plants. The honeydew attracts fungal organisms that excrete sooty mold, one of the most visible indicators of Scale.\n\nPhoto by Dan Gill/LSU AgCenter\n\nHow do I treat Scale on my houseplants?\n\nBefore you start eradicating Scale, you should immediately quarantine the infected plant.\n\nRemoval of Scale is challenging. You have to either scrape off the waxy or hard shells or catch crawlers before they settle and begin to form their own hard surface.\n\nYou can remove hard scales by wiping the plant with a clean cotton pad or cotton swab and rubbing alcohol. Alternatively, you could try using your fingernail, tweezers, or even a toothbrush. However, this could damage the delicate structure of the plant stem or leaves, so you need to be careful. If you have so many Scale that removal seems impossible, you may want to discard the plant as it could infect others in your collection.\n\nOnce you‚Äôve removed the Scale, use an insecticidal soap or horticultural oil to kill any crawlers. Spray the entire plant from top to bottom with the soap or oil, then wipe foliage clean with a soft rag or paper towel. Dispose of the towel immediately. Please note insecticide should be applied in the evening or away from direct bright light. The reflection of light on the oil could burn your plant‚Äôs leaves.\n\nFurther Thoughts‚Ä¶\n\nYou will need to repeat the insecticidal soap or horticultural oil application weekly with diligence to catch any remaining crawlers. To prevent future infestations of Scale, ask one of the experts in our Houseplant Haven about systemic indoor plant insecticides.\n\nIf you have any questions about the appearance of Scale on your houseplant, we‚Äôre here to help! Please do not bring your plant to the store. Take a photo of your plant, including the area of concern, and bring the photo to our store or attach it in an email to [email protected].\n\nRecommended Products\n\nNatria RTU Insecticidal Soap\n\nSku 152948\n\nRetail $9.99\n\nKills insects in minutes.
