        "text": "APHIDS\n\nSmall, sap-sucking pests with pear-shaped, unarmored bodies; species range from yellow, green, black, brown, to pink. Wingless adults and female nymphs are most common in interior spaces, though winged forms may emerge from overcrowded colonies.\n\nEggs hatch in the spring, producing a wingless female that will parthenogenetically reproduce more wingless females. Aphids may develop wings once the host plant has perished, allowing them to locate a new host with ease.\n\nUse piercing, sucking mouthparts to feed on plant sap. Because aphids require more protein than they’re able to extract from plant tissues, they will excrete the excess sugars that they suck from the plant. Can transmit viral diseases.\n\nFound on undersides of developing leaves and on new buds.\n\nHerbs\n\nAnnuals grown indoors\n\nFlowering plants\n\nSPIDER MITES\n\nread the guide\n\nHave oval shaped bodies and their possible colors range from red through yellow to green.\n\nThe body of a spider mite is separated into two distinct parts: (1) the gnathosoma and (2) the idiosoma. The gnathosoma includes only the mouthparts. The idiosoma is the remainder of the body and parallels the head, thorax and abdomen of insects.\n\nThe eggs are attached to fine silk webbing and hatch in approximately 3 days. The life cycle is composed of the egg, the larva, two nymphal stages, and the adult. The length of time from egg to adult varies greatly depending on temperature. Under optimum conditions (~80ºF), spider mites complete their development in 5 to 20 days. There are many overlapping generations per year. The adult female lives 2 to 4 weeks and is capable of laying several hundred eggs during her life.\n\nFeeds by piercing plant surfaces with the needle like mouthpart, subsequently sucking out the plant’s cellular contents. This leaves a grayish or yellowish stippled appearance on the foliage and causes distortion, dried out foliage, and leaf drop.\n\nFound on undersides of newly developed leaves.\n\nWebs may be visible on any part of the plant during heavy infestations.\n\nAs their populations rapidly expand and competition for food increases, mites will congregate at the apex of the plant and produce web-like silk glands on which individual mites travel.\n\nCalathea, Maranta spp.\n\nFicus spp.\n\nPalms\n\nFatsia japonica\n\nBird of Paradise\n\nNatal Mahogany\n\nIvy spp.\n\nOval shaped, often covered by a waxy, filamentous, white, cotton-like material\n\nVary in length from ⅛ inch to ⅕ inch; soil mealybugs are sometimes found on plant roots, with their appearance and feeding habits similar to those of the foliar type.\n\nLong tailed type gives birth to living nymphs, while secretions from the short-tailed type produce an egg mass containing from 100-300 eggs; eggs hatch into immature crawlers within 14 days, while nymphs generally require 6-8 weeks to mature, but can do so in as little as 18 days at high temperatures.\n\nExtraction of plant sap results in discoloration, stunting, and possible death of the plant. Control is difficult, as even some pesticides may not penetrate the waxy, cotton-like covering of these dense insect colonies.\n\nFound at stem nodes, in leaf axils, and in undersides of leaves along the veins.\n\nAglaonema spp.\n\nEpipremnum spp.\n\nDracaena spp.\n\nTwo main groups exist: armored or hard scales; and unarmored or soft scales\n\nThe names refer to the shell-like coverings which protect the insect body. Control, as with mealybug, is hindered by the protective scale covering the insect.\n\nScales measure up to ⅛ inch long and can be round, oval, or oyster shell-shaped, predominantly brown in color but can range from white to black.\n\nFemales may produce hundreds of eggs beneath the scale; eggs later hatch into tiny translucent crawlers about 1/100-inch long; these unprotected crawlers migrate to new feeding sites where they become attached to the plant and develop their own protective shells.\n\nRemoval of plant sap causes yellowing and wilting of foliage.\n\nHard scales produce very little honeydew. Dead scales look dry and puckered and are easily dislodged.\n\nFound along leaf veins or on stems.\n\nSchefflera spp.\n\nFicus spp.\n\nNatal Mahogany\n\nSucculents\n\nCATERPILLARS\n\nThe caterpillar is the worm-like larval stage of butterflies and moths.\n\nWhen the egg hatches, the caterpillar will start his work and eat the leaf it was born onto. Thus, the mother butterfly needs to lay her eggs on the type of leaf the caterpillar will eat – each caterpillar type likes only certain types of leaves. Since they are tiny and can not travel to a new plant, the caterpillar needs to hatch on the kind of leaf it wants to eat.\n\nIn addition to creating notches and holes from feeding, caterpillars generally leave black fecal deposits on plants.\n\nCan infest nearly all parts of the plant, and some can even be found in the growing media or underneath pots.\n\nHerbs\n\nAnnuals grown indoors\n\nFlowering plants\n\nManagement\n\nManual removal. You can tell how many of them you have on a plant by how much of their poop (black dots) is distributed on the foliage!\n\nCENTIPEDES & MILLIPEDES\n\nCentipedes are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Most centipedes are generally venomous and could inflict a painful bite, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendage known as forcipules. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs. Centipedes are predominantly carnivorous.\n\nCentipedes mate in warm months and stay dormant through winter. A centipede may live up to six years.\n\nCentipedes are usually attracted to houseplants because of an abundance of organic material -- such as fallen leaves -- and moisture.\n\nCentipedes feed on home-invading species like cockroaches and spiders.\n\nCentipedes neither feed on, nor damage plants.\n\nCentipedes may find their ways into your indoor plants while looking for insects to feed on.\n\nThe warmth and safety of a heated home may also attract centipedes inside to reproduce.\n\nAny"
