        "text": "In an apparent contradiction, anyone familiar with Central American and Mexican cycads in the field is aware that they are now both understudied and over-described depending on the region, the genus and the author. Mesoamerican botanical authorities Michael Grayum and Barry Hammel, writing in 2011 in the Manual de Plantas de Costa Rica’s “Cutting Edge” wryly pointed out, “We've noticed in passing that folks who work on cycads tend to predicate sp. determinations on the minutest of differences between individual specimens.” While some cycad taxonomists may take issue with this statement, I agree that there are certainly instances of this happening in the past. This issue aside, I also believe that most recently-described species appear to be valid and there are many quite distinct regional forms that are either slam-dunk obvious novel species, or warrant disciplined scrutiny.\n\nOne of the challenges to evaluating the diversity and intraspecific variation of regional cycads is that relatively few people are familiar with a representative selection of Mesoamerican cycads in the field. Fewer still have seen most of the southern Mexican, Central American and Panamanian species in nature, and less than a handful have seen anything close to all the described, and known but currently undescribed, taxa in the wild. As far as I am aware no-one has seen them all, either living or in herbaria, since some undescribed taxa have not yet made it to a plant press. Note that cultivated plants can sometimes assume leaflet forms and colors, as well as peduncular lengths and cone sizes, that differ from wild plants. While Oaxacan, Chiapan, Belizean, some Costa Rican and many Panamanian cycad localities have been well-visited by botanists and cycad collectors, the majority of Guatemalan, Honduran and Nicaraguan cycad habitats and populations have not.\n\nOff their home grounds, some Neotropical cycads can often be difficult to identify with certainty in the absence of developed cones. While leaflet shape, size and marginal teeth arrangement, petiole armature and caudex height and diameter are often used as key characters to typify new regional cycads (especially zamias), in my experience all of these can be very variable within populations. Molecular work has helped to clarify relationships within genera, but this tool is usually unavailable in practical terms to the everyman. Differences between even well-recognized species can often be subtle and challenging to interpret without the entirety of inputs that careful observation of reproductive wild populations provides.\n\nIt is common knowledge among U.S. and Central American-based cycad researchers as well as some hard-core enthusiasts elsewhere that there are a significant number of undescribed cycad species reported from or suspected to occur in southern México, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panamá. For those unfamiliar with the breed, cycad collectors can be, to put it mildly, “competitive”. In order to sidestep controversy with these populations, as well as threats posed by unregulated extraction that publicizing specifics about them on the internet would certainly prompt, aside from background references they will not be discussed nor shown here.\n\nLikewise, no specific locality data is provided in this article since my past experience has shown that doing so invariably translates into renewed collecting pressure on wild populations by nurserymen looking to add new species and localities to their inventories.\n\nAbbreviations used in the text, TMF = Tropical Moist Forest, TWF = Tropical Wet Forest, TRF = Tropical Rain Forest and TPF = Tropical Pluvial Forest.\n\nSpecies accounts, in alphabetical order:\n\nCeratozamia hondurensis – a very localized large and endangered species native to northwestern Honduras TRF. Based on its current highly fragmented distribution and regional deforestation patterns, it probably also occurred in northeastern Guatemala during the last century where it would now have been extirpated. It has a barely emergent caudex in mature plants with leaves to ~9’/2.80 m tall and very wide, thin-textured leaflets. Earlier confused with Zamia tuerckheimii by at least two botanists and cycad collectors, and was cultivated as a zamia in Australia for some time prior to its description in 2008. Subject to special protections in Honduras and, like all species of Ceratozamia, is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Still quite rare in cultivation but artificially-propagated plants have been produced by a few private collectors and at least one public garden in the U.S.\n\nDioon mejiae (Tiusinte) – restricted to north central Honduras in mixed Caribbean pine-tropical broadleaf forest. Still abundant at some localities despite reports as recently as the early 1990s that it was threatened with extinction, although it has been extirpated at some sites (Haynes and Bonta, 2007). Probably one of the most abundant Central American cycads and certainly the tallest. The large seeds of this species are very popular for the elaboration of special tortillas, tamales and toys throughout their range in Honduras (Bonta et. al., 2006). A deservedly popular landscape cycad in subtropical and tropical climates around the world. Despite claims made in Jones (1993) and Whitelock (2002) this species is not known to occur in Nicaragua as a wild plant. However, in both that country and Guatemala, they are popular garden plants under lowland tropical conditions and limited regional trade in trunking wild plants probably still occurs. The almost certain absence of Dioon species from Guatemala today remains a mystery to cycad researchers. As currently understood, approximately 450 miles/700 km separate D. mejiae from the closest population in southeastern Mexico, although plenty of ostensibly suitable, rugged Dioon habitat occurs in western and central Guatemala. Dioon merolae is known as far east as western Chiapas on both the Pacific versant and in the Central Depression at low to middle elevations. Given the edibility and documented human exploitation of the seeds of species in this complex and the very dense human population that political Guatemala had during the pre-contact era, perhaps the most reasonable supposition is that the “missing” indigenous member of this genus was simply overharvested as a famine food to extinction or near extinction; relic populations may have been finished off during the second wave of wholesale habitat transformation that began in the 1950s and 1960s in the country. Reports of indigenous dioons from Guatemala, or populations located adjacent to its borders, have thus far been proven to be in error.\n\nZamia variegata – extreme eastern Chiapas, Mexico through most of northern Guatemala, Belize and just into northwestern Honduras. Formerly known as Z. muricata var. picta or Z. picta. Mostly restricted to the understory TWF and TRF, but some populations may occur in more open, drier foothill environments together with native Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea). This species can be confusingly variable even within small populations, probably reflecting the morphological influence of three other sympatric zamias that it apparently hybridizes with: Z. standleyi, Z. prasina and a currently undescribed central Guatemalan species. Plants in eastern Guatemala occasionally to at least 12’/3.70 m tall with a very short emergent, stout caudex to >10”/25 cm in diameter. Usually subterranean until extremely old, when it can be short emergent on karst or serpentine. Its canopy is upright, often of shuttlecock habit when grown under bright conditions, but may spread in deep shade. Lithophytic or terrestrial. Leaflet color ranges from pure green to almost entirely yellow, with the brightest flash markings evident on coastal plants. Color extremes may be found side by side in mature plants in at least one population in Guatemala. Frequently littoral in Caribbean Guatemala where it may occasionally be subject to flooding with brackish water. Except for some putative Z. standleyi hybrids on the Honduran-Guatemalan border, plants appear to decline noticeably in height from east to west. Although Calonje, et. al. (2009) report that this species is restricted to elevations below 975’/300 m in Belize, I have seen and included here a photograph of this species in premontane TRF along the Guatemalan-Honduran border at ~2,275’/700 m\n\nTwo manmade hybrids involving Z. furfuracea retained the yellow leaf spotting of the Z. variegata seed parent (Whitelock 2002).\n\nAsian cycad scale (Aulacaspis yasumatsui); one of the “unarmored” armored scales, was apparently introduced into the U.S. (Miami, Florida) from southeast Asia in the mid-1990s and has rapidly become a nightmare for some cycad growers around the world. It is also a threat to wild cycads and is currently decimating some populations of insular Pacific Cycas species. Since the latter part of the last decade it is widespread in nurseries and gardens growing Cycas species in Guatemala and (now) in southeastern México where cycad researchers are deservedly concerned that it may spread to native species. Besides Old World cycads, this pest is now also known to infest Dioon merolae, D. spinulosum, D. purpusii, Zamia loddigesi, Z. splendens and a variety of other Neotropical cycad species (Normack et al., 2017, L. Noblick, pers. comm., J. Abascal, pers. comm). It appears to require tropical or warm subtropical conditions to thrive. There are no current reports of this pest from Panamá and Costa Rica. Very specific systemic pesticidal and biological control measures of varying efficacy are available to combat cycad scale, with periodic drenches of Safari and imidacloprid being front line defenses. Most contact insecticides and “hippy” solutions like applying spent coffee grounds and neem oil appear to be a waste of time and money. Anecdotal reports suggest that even within genera known to be especially susceptible to cycad scale, some species are far more vulnerable than others and that these should be avoided where this pest is established in the landscape.\n\nOther less-specialized armored scales respond quickly to the treatments discussed above for mealies and cycad scale.\n\nCaterpillars; in tropical landscapes located where zamias and ceratozamias are native, the larvae of Eumaeus butterfly species can be persistent and devastating pests if ignored, attacking new leaves in particular (pers. obs., J. Abascal, pers. comm.). They can be controlled by manual removal if occurring in small numbers or with contact or anti-feedant larvicides. In Guatemala and probably elsewhere, some noctuid moth larvae will also predate newly-emerged cycad leaves, destroying new flushes in minutes.\n\nSlugs; are an occasional pest in both greenhouse and landscape and will damage or kill newly-emerging leaves in a single feeding session. Baiting with beer traps or molluscicides are effective controls. Take preventive steps to avoid contact/exclude if you have pets or wildlife entering growing areas where the latter have been applied. Metaldehyde is DEADLY to dogs; no antidote available, so exercise caution when using it if you have bow-wows around.\n\nFungal rots and leaflet spotting; periodic drenches of Banrot (etridiazole and thiophante-methyl) are useful when expecting prolonged wet weather and coupled with dithane + mancozeb + surfactant sprays will help prevent caudex rots and leaf spotting. I have made inconclusive trials with both mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial innoculants over the past 15 years, specifically with Actinovate AG (Streptomyces lydicus) in California and commercially available mycorrhizal strains in Guatemala. These applications were made in an attempt to improve vigor of sometimes challenging subterranean rainforest cycad species like Zamia dressleri and the upper Amazonian Z. ulei. They certainly didn’t appear to do any harm, but I’m not sure that I saw any tangible benefits either. Nonetheless, I keep an open mind about use of these products and believe that they can add an extra boost to otherwise healthy plants that seem to be struggling a bit. It may seem obvious, but don’t apply packaged mycorrhizae to your soils if you’ve recently drenched or sprayed a systemic fungicide.\n\nMice and rats; can be a genuine pain in the ass in cycad collections around the world and will randomly chew or feed on older stems of the less toxic species. They will also gnaw on and steal seeds, clip petioles on seedlings and dig around plant bases. Every grower has their lethal control measure/s of choice, so have at it folks!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank my friend and colleague Fred Muller (again) for providing many outstanding photographs of wild cycads and sharing his now unparalleled familiarity of Mesoamerican cycads in the field. There is little doubt that he has now observed and photographed more regional cycad species in nature than anyone else. Chris Hall and Dr. Arden Dearden of Queensland, Australia have very generously shared images taken in their nursery, private collection and in nature, as well as some valuable Panamanian localities, growing tips, and artificially-propagated seed with the author. Twenty years ago, Neil Carrol very kindly provided me with both “go-to” localities and his extremely good insights into Panamanian cycads and aroids in nature that remain valuable to this day. My good friends Ing. Juan José Castillo and Jaime Abascal have generously cared for my Guatemalan cycad collection for the past five years. Greg Holzman, who knows and grows Panamanian zamias as well as anyone, was kind enough to share the amazing image of a new flush on one of his mature Zamia hamannii shown here. Rory Antolak, who is familiar with most Mesoamerican cycads in nature and gardens, also provided informed and welcome background color on the state of rare cycad cultivation in south Florida and elsewhere."
