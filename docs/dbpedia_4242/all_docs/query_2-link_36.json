The damage they cause can look similar to that of other pests, so it’s important to properly identify the source before treating affected plants.\n\nMealybugs thrive in warmer temperatures and are most often found on houseplants, greenhouse-grown specimens, or outdoor landscape plants in warm climates. In colder regions, they can be present outdoors during warmer summer months.\n\nBecause mealybugs reproduce frequently and in large numbers, it’s crucial to recognize the early signs in order to control and eradicate these pests.\n\nOn this page: What Are Mealybugs? | Types of Mealybugs | Get Rid of Mealybugs | Prevent Mealybugs | Recognize the Presence of Mealybugs | Identify Damage | Plants Susceptible | Frequently Asked Questions\n\nOn this page:\n\nWHAT ARE MEALYBUGS?\n\nTYPES OF MEALYBUGS\n\nHOW TO GET RID OF MEALYBUGS ON PLANTS\n\nHOW TO PREVENT MEALYBUGS\n\nRECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF MEALYBUGS\n\nIDENTIFY MEALYBUG DAMAGE ON PLANTS\n\nPLANTS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MEALYBUGS\n\nMEALYBUGS ON HOUSEPLANTS\n\nWHAT ARE MEALYBUGS?\n\nMealybugs are small soft-bodied insects that are 1/20 to 1/5 inch in size. The white or pale pink body is oval and distinctly segmented, with a white or gray cottony wax coating. Mealybugs are related to scale; however, unlike scale, they retain their legs throughout their life cycle. Mealybugs crawl and move slowly, so will not rapidly disperse on their own.\n\nAdult females are wingless, while adult males, which are seldom seen, are wasp-like in appearance and are winged and flying. Mealybugs reproduce quickly and in large numbers, making them difficult to control and eradicate.\n\nMealybugs have sucking mouthparts that are used to extract sap from plants. As they feed, some species may inject toxins or plant pathogens into host plants. Mealybugs excrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can cause secondary problems, such as sooty mold or attracting ants.\n\nTYPES OF MEALYBUGS\n\nLong-tailed mealybug. Photo by: AjayTVM / Shutterstock.\n\nThere are hundreds of mealybug species, with about 300 species found in North America. Some of the more common include:\n\nCitrus mealybugs attack citrus, landscape shrubs, and tropical or greenhouse specimens such as begonia, coleus, amaryllis, and cyclamen.\n\nLong-tailed mealybugs are named for the tail filaments that develop on this species. They prefer citrus, grapes, nursery stock, houseplants including dracaena, and can also affect a wide range of ornamental plants.\n\nGrape mealybugs target grape vines and fruit trees such as pears and pomegranates.\n\nMexican mealybugs prefer to feed on ornamental plants including chrysanthemum, English ivy, lantana, geranium, hollyhock, and poinsettia.\n\nRoot mealybugs feed on the roots of ornamentals including anemone, iris, yarrow, African violet, and many types of shrubs and ornamental grasses.\n\nHOW TO GET RID OF MEALYBUGS ON PLANTS\n\nVideo: Taking Care of Mealybugs on Houseplants, from Garden Answer\n\nTheir outer wax coating acts as a shield, making it difficult to eradicate mealybugs with soap or oils. These remedies are more effective on young nymphs, which have less protection.\n\nIf mealybugs are present, try these tips:\n\nSpray with water:\n\nFor lighter infestations, mealybug adults, nymphs and eggs can be dislodged with a gentle spray of water. Take care not to spray too hard to avoid damage to plant tissues.\n\nKeep leaves clean:\n\nTo control honeydew and sooty mold, wipe down affected leaves with a damp cloth or spray with water.\n\nIntroduce natural predators:\n\nFor outdoor and greenhouse environments, beneficial insects that prey on mealybugs offer natural pest control. These include lacewings, spiders, ladybugs, parasitic wasps, minute pirate bugs, and a lady beetle known as a mealybug destroyer.\n\nUse rubbing alcohol:\n\nUse a solution of 70% isopropyl alcohol. Soak a cotton ball in the alcohol and dab affected areas, which will remove and kill insects. Test a small area first to make sure it doesn’t cause leaf burn. For larger infestations, a 10-25% solution diluted with water can be applied with a spray bottle. Repeat weekly if necessary.\n\nPrune:\n\nIf the infestation is localized, trim out affected branches and dispose in the garbage.\n\nUse insecticidal soap:\n\nFor heavier indoor or outdoor infestations, use an insecticidal soap, such as Safer's. You can also make your own solution by mixing 1 tablespoon of mild liquid soap such as Castile or Ivory with 1 quart of water. Apply with a spray bottle. Repeat treatment if necessary.\n\nTry horticultural oil:\n\nNeem oil is a natural remedy derived from the neem tree. The oil will coat and suffocate eggs, nymphs and adults. Repeat treatment as needed. (Read more on how to use neem oil.)\n\nDispose of affected plants:\n\nSometimes infestations are too big or can’t be controlled even with repeat applications of soap, oil, or other remedies. In this case, the best solution may be to throw out the entire plant to prevent the spread of mealybugs to other plants.\n\nAvoid chemical insecticides:\n\nThough they may control mealybug infestations, they may also kill beneficial insects.\n\nHOW TO PREVENT MEALYBUGS\n\nThe most effective tool for controlling mealybugs is prevention.\n\nKeep plants healthy:\n\nHealthy plants are more able to ward off pests and diseases.\n\nPlant selection:\n\nChoose plants that are less prone to mealybugs.\n\nInspect new plants:\n\nCarefully inspect newly purchased plants before bringing them home from the nursery to prevent spreading pests to other plants.\n\nCheck plants regularly:\n\nMake it part of your plant maintenance routine to inspect plants regularly to detect problems early on. Pay closer attention to plants that are more susceptible.\n\nKnow the signs:\n\nLook for insects or eggs on new growth and more hidden areas. Check for plant damage, honeydew, or black sooty mold.\n\nApply horticultural oil regularly:\n\nFor susceptible plants, wipe down leaves periodically with Neem oil to discourage pests.\n\nAvoid nitrogen-rich fertilizer and overwatering:\n\nNitrogen stimulates tender new growth that mealybugs prefer, and may lead to increased egg production. Too much water can also lead to excessive new growth.\n\nCheck tools, pots, and stakes:\n\nMealybugs and eggs sacs may be hidden in these spots.\n\nLower indoor temperatures:\n\nMealybugs thrive in temperatures between 70 to 90 degrees F. For houseplants that can tolerate cooler temperatures, lower the thermostat to 60 degrees F at night to discourage pests.\n\nHOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF MEALYBUGS\n\nPhoto by: TBamphoto / Shutterstock\n\nLook for excretions:\n\nMealybugs are most often found in colonies. Observe plants for white cotton-like excretions, which will indicate clusters of mealybugs or their egg sacs. Mealybugs are sometimes confused with other pests that also produce waxy coatings such as scale, aphids, and whiteflies. Pull back the cottony coating and examine closely to properly identify.\n\nExamine plants thoroughly:\n\nMealybugs prefer more hidden spots. Look in leaf/stem joints, between two touching fruits, on stems near the soil, or around the plant crown.\n\nCheck new growth:\n\nThese pests feed on newer plant growth, which is more tender.\n\nInspect containers:\n\nCheck around drainage holes of potted plants for cottony masses to detect the presence of root-feeding mealybugs.\n\nLook for sooty mold:\n\nThe appearance of black sooty mold that develops from the presence of honeydew excretions is another indicator of mealybugs. Honeydew is produced by other sucking insects including whitefly, aphids, or leafhoppers, so it’s important to properly identify the source.\n\nIDENTIFY MEALYBUGS DAMAGE ON PLANTS\n\nMealybugs feed by extracting sap from plants, causing damage to plant tissue. Symptoms may include stunting, yellow or wilted leaves, deformed growth, loss of flower buds, defoliation, and chlorosis. Honeydew excretions can interfere with photosynthesis and encourage a fungus called sooty mold. With extreme infestations, plants may die.\n\nPLANTS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MEALYBUGS\n\nPhoto by: Protasov AN / Shutterstock.\n\nWeakened or stressed plants are more prone to pest damage.\n\nHouseplants that mealybugs prefer include African violets, begonias, dracaena, hoya, orchids, jade plant, palms, philodendron, schefflera, clivia, and poinsettia.\n\nSucculents, such as aloe, agave, and echeveria, are more vulnerable because of their compact shape and multi-layered leaf structure. Mealybugs like to hide in plant crevices, so plant damage may not be apparent until an infestation is well underway. Affected plants may develop scarred leaves and become deformed.\n\nFruit trees and crops such as citrus, avocado, mango, and fig are more susceptible. Mealybug infestations may cause fruits to drop off prematurely.\n\nWoody shrubs and ornamentals can be prone to mealybugs in warmer temperatures, causing flower buds to drop off prematurely. Kniphofia and phormium plants are especially susceptible.\n\nVegetable crops such as cabbage, cucumber, lettuce, asparagus, peppers, and beans may be affected.\n\nFREQUENLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nWhat causes mealybugs?\n\nMealybugs are most often introduced from infested greenhouse-grown plants purchased at a nursery or garden center. They may also be found in potting soil or on grocery store produce. Carefully inspect new plants before buying and isolate new houseplants for several weeks to make sure you’re not introducing pests to other plants.\n\nAre mealybugs harmful to humans?\n\nMealybugs don’t bite, but coming into direct contact with them can cause mild skin irritation for some people.\n\nWhy do mealybugs appear?\n\nMealybugs are attracted to certain kinds of plants and those with young new growth. They thrive in warmer temperatures, so will be more commonly present outdoors during summer, in greenhouse environments, or inside the home."
