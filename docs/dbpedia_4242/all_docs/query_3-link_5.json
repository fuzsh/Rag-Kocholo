        "text": "Although most species of mealybugs feed on the aerial parts of the plant, some species extract their nourishment from roots, whilst others are gall-formers. A few species can also transmit harmful viruses. Mealybugs inflict damage on the crop in various ways:\n\nnymphs and females extract the sap from the plant, stunting growth and causing deformation and/or yellowing of leaves, sometimes followed by defoliation. The overall effect reduces photosynthesis and therefore the yield. Where flowers and fruit are concerned, these often drop off;\n\nplant sap is low in proteins and rich in sugars. In order to gain an adequate intake of protein, mealybugs must ingest large quantities of sap, getting rid of the excess sugars in the form of honeydew. Characteristically, dark sooty moulds (Cladosporium spp.) are often found growing on this honeydew, which, as well as the white, waxy secretion of the mealybugs, reduces the ornamental value of the affected plants. Fruit and flowers are also fouled, rendering them unfit for sale, and the reduced level of photosynthesis in the leaves also reduces flower and fruit production;\n\nin ornamental crops, the mere presence of mealybugs is sufficient to render the product unfit for sale. A very small population can thus cause considerable loss of value.\n\nSoft scales feed mostly on leaves and twigs, causing discolouration of foliage, stunting, and in extreme cases eventual defoliation. However, it is mainly the great quantity of honey-dew that causes the damage because of the sooty mould that grows on it. Ants are also attracted by the honeydew. In fact, the honeydew with its sooty mould is usually the first sign of the presence of this type of pest. Among ornamental crops, ferns are particularly sensitive to soft scales, as are oleanders and orchids.\n\nArmoured scales, unlike mealybugs and soft scales, produce no honeydew. They feed by sucking the contents of epidermal cells, into which they inject toxic substances that cause yellow, red or brown patches to appear on leaves and fruit. This can eventually kill the leaf."
