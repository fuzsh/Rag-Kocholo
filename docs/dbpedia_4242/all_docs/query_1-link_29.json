        "text": "Scale on plants sounds like and looks like a plant disease, but the term \"scale\" actually refers to an infestation by any one of over 8,000 species of tiny, sap-sucking insects. Scale insects typically adhere to the stems, branches, and sometimes leaves of plants to feed on sap. They have a shell-like bump appearance, which makes it easy to mistake them for a fungal or bacterial disease. Though, the treatment of scale on plants is much different than the treatment for plant diseases, so it is essential to know the difference.\n\nBelow, learn about how to identify, combat, and control scale insects on plants both inside and outside.\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nBefore taking steps to eliminate scale on plants, you must ensure you are dealing with scale and not plant disease. It is often confused for fungal or bacterial infections, like leaf spots or blight.\n\nIdentifying Scale\n\nTo properly identify scale, you have to know what you are looking for. Identifying common varieties of scale insects and early warning signs as well as indicators of damage will go a long way in helping your plants.\n\nTypes of Scale Insects\n\nScale insects are closely related to aphids and whiteflies. They vary significantly in color, shape, and size. They are often somewhat rounded, but not always. Different scale varieties can be white, black, orange, or a color that blends in with the plant's coloring, making them even more challenging to detect.\n\nScale insects are usually divided into soft scale and hard or armored scale. Soft scale is covered with a protective waxy substance and is somewhat easier to kill than hard or armored scale. Armored scale secretes a hard shell over its body for protection from predators. The shell also makes it difficult to use a pesticide because it has trouble reaching the insect inside.\n\nDifferent species of scale insects favor different plants. Euonymous shrubs are frequently infested by scale. Other common scale victims are magnolia and fruit trees. A member of the soft or unarmored scale family, mealybugs are a widespread garden pest and somewhat larger than most scale insects, making them easier to identify as an insect rather than a disease.\n\nSigns of Scale on Plants\n\nMost scale insects are small, ranging from 1/16 to 1/8 inch long. However, you will never see just one of them, which makes them hard to miss. Scale almost always appears in clusters. Unlike other insects, they are immobile once they lock themselves into place to pierce the plant and begin feeding on sap. If you see clusters of tiny shell-like bumps on the stems or leaves of a plant, it is likely scale.\n\nOne of the primary ways gardeners realize they have an issue with scale is by the appearance of sooty mold on the plant. Scale insects produce a sugary honeydew when feeding on the plants, which attract fungal organisms that produce sooty mold in some scales, but not all. The blackish mold is one of the most visible indicators of scale.\n\nScale Damage\n\nAlong with allowing fungal diseases to thrive through their honeydew deposits, scale harms your plant by depleting it of sap, which therefore hinders the plantâs ability to send nutrients through its entire body. Scale also causes cellular damage to the plant, making it structurally weaker. If left untreated, the scale will damage and weaken your plants and, most likely, eventually cause them to die.\n\nWhen to Combat Scale\n\nScale insects are adept at protecting themselves at most life cycle stages. Scale eggs are laid under the female's body, so they are shielded by the protective outer coating of the mother insect.\n\nControl measures are most effective during the scale insect's \"crawler stage\"âthe nymphs that appear soon after the eggs hatch. At this point, the nymphs have legs and are actively crawling to find new spots to attach and feed. This is the time when they can be effectively killed with pesticides. However, timing is everything, and there is a short window of opportunity.\n\nBecause adult scale insects are so firmly attached to their host plant and covered in their armor coating, they can be tricky to exterminate. Sometimes, throwing out infested plants is easier than taking all the steps necessary to try and eradicate the scale. Quick removal can prevent the scale from migrating to surrounding plants. But if this is not practical, several control methods have proven effective against scale.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKerrZOae6S7zGifqK9dqbxus8StZKuhlGK8p3nSnJilnV2eu7Sxwq2qZmlkZX93hZI%3D"
