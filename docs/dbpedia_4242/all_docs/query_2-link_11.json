        "text": "Family of insects (Pseudococcidae)\n\nPseudococcidae Mealybugs on a flower stem in Yogyakarta Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Hemiptera Suborder: Sternorrhyncha Superfamily: Coccoidea Family: Pseudococcidae\n\nHeymons, 1915 [1]\n\nMealybugs are insects in the family Pseudococcidae, unarmored scale insects found in moist, warm habitats. Of the more than 2000 described species, many are considered pests as they feed on plant juices of greenhouse plants, house plants and subtropical trees and also act as a vector for several plant diseases. Some ants live in symbiotic relationships with them, protecting them from predators and feeding off the honeydew which they excrete.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nMealybugs are sexually dimorphic: females appear as nymphs, exhibiting reduced morphology, and lack wings, although unlike many female scale insects, they often retain legs and can move. Males are smaller, gnat-like and have wings. Since mealybugs (as well as all other Hemiptera) are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. However, male mealybugs do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to wasp-like flying adults.[citation needed]\n\nMealybug females feed on plant sap, normally in roots or other crevices, and in a few cases the bottoms of stored fruit. They attach themselves to the plant and secrete a powdery wax layer (hence the name \"mealy\" bug) used for protection while they suck the plant juices. In Asia, mango mealybug is considered a major menace for the mango crop. The males on the other hand are short-lived as they do not feed at all as adults and only live to fertilize the females. Male citrus mealy bugs fly to the females and resemble fluffy gnats.\n\nSome species of mealybug lay their eggs in the same waxy layer used for protection in quantities of 50–100; other species are born directly from the female.\n\nThe most serious pests are mealybugs that feed on citrus; other species damage sugarcane, grapes, pineapple (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, cacti, gardenias, papaya, mulberry, sunflower and orchids. Mealybugs only tend to be serious pests in the presence of ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites.[2] Mealybugs are also a vector of viruses in grapevines, spreading grapevine leafroll and grapevine red blotch viruses.[3] Mealybugs also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as Sarracenia (pitcher plants); in such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as diazinon. Small infestations may not inflict significant damage. In larger amounts though, they can induce leaf drop. In recent years, some of the mealybug species have become invasive pests in localities posing a great problem to the new agro-ecosystems. In India, Withania somnifera plant have been reported as a new reservoir host for an invasive mealybug species Phenacoccus solenopsis.[4]\n\nSome mealybugs of the Hypogeococcus are used as biological pest controls of invasive cacti in South Africa, including Harrisia balansae, H. martinii, and Opuntia cespitosa.[5]\n\nFossil specimens of genus Acropyga ants have been recovered from the Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits and several individuals are preserved carrying the extinct mealybug genus Electromyrmococcus.[6] These fossils represent the oldest record of the symbiosis between mealybugs and Acropyga species ants.[6]\n\nMale hibiscus mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus\n\nFormica fusca ants tending a herd of mealybugs\n\nA ladybird preying on mealybugs\n\nMealybugs on hibiscus plant\n\nAcropyga glaesaria ant carrying an Electromyrmococcus abductus mealybug\n\nControl methods\n\n[edit]\n\nInsecticides such as pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin) have been used for control,[7] but this approach is often considered counter-productive due to mortality of mealybug natural enemies.\n\nSome gardeners use species of predatory beetles (e.g. Cryptolaemus) and green lacewings (Chrysopidae) larvae to control mealybug infestations, as the larval lacewings are voracious predators of aphids and other small insects.[8]\n\nMetabolism\n\n[edit]\n\nMealybugs have a highly sophisticated metabolism that involves not one but two bacterial endosymbionts, one inside the other. The endosymbionts make essential amino acids that the mealybug is not able to acquire directly from its diet. Genetically, mealybugs rely on a \"mosaic\" of metabolic pathways in which proteins are transported across membranes between what were once independent organisms.[9]\n\nUse in the Textile Industry\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Oaxaca Mexico, where mealybugs are known as cochinilla algodonosa, the insects are intentionally cultivated and farmed. Dried mealybugs are traditionally ground into a red dust, which is used to dye fabrics.\n\nPrickly Pear Cactus with Mealybugs\n\nMealybugs on Prickly Pear Cactus Leaves\n\nMealybugs being ground into traditional red dye in Oaxaca, Mexico\n\nGenera\n\n[edit]\n\nExtinct genera:\n\n†Electromyrmococcus Williams, 2001\n\n†Phyllococcus Ehrhorn, 1916 (monotypic)\n\nNote:\n\nthe genus Puto is now placed in its own family\n\nLachnodius Maskell, 1896 is now placed in the Eriococcidae\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nJahn, G.
