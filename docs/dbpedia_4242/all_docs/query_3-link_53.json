        "text": "Imidacloprid – Imidacloprid is a pesticide that works too well for its own good. If you have heard of neonicotinoids killing bees, it’s this stuff. By 1999 it was the most widely used pesticide in the world but has since been banned in the EU. However, used correctly it is one of the safest and most effective systemics available. It is labeled for use on greenhouse plants or indoor plants, neither of which will harm bees. Never use it on an outdoor plant that will be flowering in the next 3 months although it is good for treating outdoor plants when you bring them inside for the winter to kill any hitchhikers\n\nIt is available in granular form which is applied to the soil then watered in. It kills EVERYTHING except for hard scale and spider mites, including soil borne pests like thrips, fungus gnats and mealybugs and lasts for 90 days between applications. Since it is applied via the roots it isn’t instant and is better as a preventative than to treat heavy infestations. All indoor plants should be treated with this as a systemic, as soon as you pot them up or bring them home for the first time (reapplying at least once or twice a year ensures your plants will be pest free indefinitely)\n\nIt is available from amazon sold as Bonide systemic houseplant insect control in an 8oz container for about $20."
