        "text": "Common Name: Mealybug\n\nScientific Name: Planococcus citri, Pseudococcus longispinus, P. calceolariae and others\n\nMealybug is a small, sap-sucking insect which secretes a powdery wax substance to protect itself. When Mealybugs appear on leaves and stems, they are easily identifiable by their white cottony coating. Mealybugs thrive in warm humid conditions and are commonly found on houseplants and in greenhouses.\n\nMealybugs cause damage by sucking sap from their host plants, and they have a tendency to favor new growth, as do many pests, and may sometimes be accompanied by ants which ‘farm’ them for their honeydew. The leaves become yellowed and eventually fall off the plant as a result of their damage. Moreover, they can cause fruits, vegetables, and flower buds to drop prematurely. In severe infestations, their honeydew (waxy excretions) can stimulate the growth of Black Sooty mould.\n\nMealybug Pest Identification\n\nLeaves fluffy white residue - looks like tiny fluffy cotton wool on your plants.\n\nSoft bodied and slightly pink with white covering.\n\nBlack sooty mould - sign they may be present.\n\nPlant looks unhappy or weakened.\n\nWaxy white residue on roots.\n\nHow do Mealbug spread?\n\nMealy bugs are everywhere and often hitch a ride on other plants.\n\nCan hitch a ride your clothing from outdoors or other infested spaces.\n\nThey are slow movers and can only move during their nyphm (young) phase in their life cycle.\n\nMales can fly during their reproductive stage, and will fly in from open windows.\n\nWhat Part of the Plant can Mealybug be found?\n\nUsually in clusters under leaf axils, sheaths, in twining stems or under loose bark.\n\nSome species are found on roots as a white fluffy residue.\n\nOften found attacking new growth or under leaves as they are sap suckers.\n\nConditions the enhance or hinder the proliferation of Mealybugs?\n\nEnhance:\n\nWarm conditions 25°C and above.\n\nHigh humidity.\n\nPlants high in nitrogen and have soft leafy growth, eg: Tropicals, though they can be found on Succulents kept in Humid conditions.\n\nHinder:\n\nCooler Conditions of 20°C and lower.\n\nLower humidity levels of 50% and less.\n\nMealybug Pest Treatment Plans\n\nSmall manageable infestations\n\nQuarantine your infected plant.\n\nWash off Mealybug with a strong jet of water.\n\nUse rubbing alcohol (Eg: Surgical Spirits) - dip a cotton swab in alcohol and use to remove mealybug.\n\nHomemade pesticide: 2 x Garlic clove, 1 tsp cayenne pepper powder or 1 x chilli, blend together in 1 liter warm water and allow to steep for 1 hour. Strain and place into a Spray Bottle with 2 drops of dish soap. Spritz plant thoroughly.\n\nAllow to dry, and wipe down with paper towel to remove dead mealybugs.\n\nFor tips on homemade pesticides check out: 8 Homemade Pesticide Sprays for indoor plants.\n\nLarge infestations\n\nQuarantine your infected plant .\n\nRemove any highly infested foliage and stems.\n\nRinse off leaves to remove pests.\n\nSpray with an organic pesticide such as Neudosan or Pyrol.\n\nTreat every 7 - 10 days until infestation has disappeared.\n\nMealybug Preventative Measures\n\nChoosing plants that are less susceptible.\n\nRemoving hiding spaces, such as debris (fallen leaves etc) from planter.\n\nFeed and water less often as this produces harder growth and less nitrogen production in plants.\n\nInspect new plants and keep quarantined for a month.\n\nKeep ant populations under control indoors as they transport babies and protect adults.\n\nKeep plants in the optimal growing conditions that cause undue stress and weaken the plant. For detailed Plant Care Checkout our Plant Care Tab.\n\nDisinfect recycled planters sufficiently to avoid transferring eggs or nymphs.\n\nMonitor plants regularly.\n\nWipe down your foliage and stems often with a Neem Oil based pesticide.\n\nFor more on Plant Care Troubleshooting, Checkout our 2-Step Plant Health Guide."
