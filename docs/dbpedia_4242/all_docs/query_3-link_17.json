        "text": "Mealy bugs.\n\nAre.\n\nThe.\n\nAbsolute.\n\nWorst.\n\nMaybe second to spider mites, but not by much. If you only grow outdoor plants, you probably have a burning hatred for these just as much as indoor plant growers hate spider mites.\n\nFortunately, they’re much easier to deal with than spider mites, at least if you’re diligent. Nearly everyone gets mealies at some point, particularly if you bring home nursery plants or plants from big box stores. While getting the occasional bout of mealy bugs is extremely common, they can rapidly go from a manageable treatment to decimating your collection if you’re not careful.\n\nWhat is a Mealy Bug?\n\nThere are actually multiple species of mealy bug, all in the family Pseudococcidae. The ones you’re most likely to see are either the Obscure Mealy Bug, Pseudococcus affinis, or the Citrus Mealy Bug, Planococcus citri. There are numerous other species, but the general treatment and appearance is the same.\n\nThey’re almost all small, segmented little bugs that bear a passing resemblence to soft looking roly polies. Usually, they’re a bit fuzzy or waxy looking, and will lay eggs in cottony looking egg sacs. Mealybugs will eat plant sap and excrete “honeydew” and wax, causing a distinctive buildup that is easily recognizable on more infested plants.\n\nDue to the excretion of honeydew, ants will common bring mealy bugs into areas that they weren’t found previously, so keep an eye on any ant infestations around your plants.\n\nSpotting Mealy Bugs\n\nThe first sign of a mealybug infestation is often plants that don’t quite seem to be thriving, or have discoloration that can’t be readily explained by watering habits or sun exposure. You may also see the little egg sacs, which look like little white fuzzy ovals.\n\nAt right is my Aeonium “Mardi Gras”, a succulent that normally goes dormant in summer and looks a bit raggedy no matter what during this time of year.\n\nBut if you look closely, you can see that it’s a bit…off.\n\nThe leaves are coming in a bit funky in shape, and there’s weird ragged sides as well as pock marks and imperfect leaves even where it’s grown in new after our hail storm.\n\nThis plant is also kept on our concrete patio, next to an area where we have a persistent ant problem, and whenever I’d water this plant I’d see ants coming out of the pot. Ants moving into pots is also a strong sign of a probable mealy bug infestation.\n\nMealy bugs really like being close to the juicy plant stem, and in most rosette-forming succulents, you’ll find them in similar places.\n\nI had this Dudleya next to the Aeonium above (as you can guess, also in easy reach of ants). It was a beautiful, robust speciment with white farina-coated leaves, but slowly started to get sadder and sadder as I had it.\n\nWhile Dudleyas, like Aeoniums, go dormant in summer, this was not the usual summer die back.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see spotting and that the inner leaves don’t look quite right. You should also be able to see some mealybug dirt just to the bottom left of the center of the plant.\n\nAnother plant from that poor patio placement is my cluster of Echinopsis “Rose Quartz” cluster, which I’ve had for nearly 5 years now.\n\nThe side facing out towards the patio (and the sun) looked fine, but as I was moving plants around and checking what was left on the patio, I discovered the mealies had set up a buffet on the shaded side of the cactus.\n\nAt right is what the distinctive egg sacs look like, which can either hide a female laying eggs, juveniles, or just the egg sacs.\n\nFor any plants you have that are similarly exposed to harsh sunlight on only one side, make sure to check all sides at least occasionally! This happened to my Echinopsis in the space of about 2 months, and it’s definitely the most infested plant from the patio.\n\nHow to Treat Mealy Bugs\n\nThere are a ton of ways to treat mealy bugs, ranging from natural methods to heavy uses of pesticides. What works best for you in the short and long term is something you’ll have to decide on your own.\n\nNatural control\n\nOne way to try and control mealy bugs is with natural mealy bug predators, such as lacewing larvae, ladybugs, and a relative of the ladybug called “the Mealy Bug Destroyer” (an Australian relative of the US ladybug).\n\nAny and all of these can help keep mealy bugs under control, but are unlikely to completely eliminate them due to the natural balance predators and prey tend to strike. If you’re growing indoors, at least two rounds of releasing mealy bug predators should be done, preferably 3 over the course of 2 months, which should catch the mealies at pretty much all stages of development.\n\nOutdoors, these predators are a better holistic and long term choice. All three predator types will cover (relatively) large distances, particularly compared to slow moving mealy bugs, and can easily eat hundreds of mealy bug larvae each. Periodically releasing predators into your outdoor greenhouse, yard, or simply by your plant shelf can be a useful way to keep your outdoor plants safe.\n\nIt’s not perfect, however, as my plants above show (I release lacewings every spring). You may need to use other methods in combination with your predators. If using pesticides, try to give your plants at least 2 weeks between your last pesticide application and when you release the predators, as pesticides will kill the good guys too!\n\nPesticides\n\nThere’s two main ways that pesticides can work: systemic (absorbed by the plant with the intention that the pest eats the poison), or topical/spray (intended to kill the pest that touches it).\n\nMake sure when using spray pesticides that you are not spraying blooms, or that blooms are not expected for the two weeks that a systemic pesticide is usually effective. These chemical sprays will poison butterflise and bees just as much as they’ll kill mealies, and can even have negative impacts on your local hummingbirds.\n\nMany of the Bonide brand slow-release systemic granules can be effective, and for plants with powdery farina you want to preserve or a dense fluffy crown, this may be your best bet for eradicating an infestation. For my Coryphantha above, I had to mix granules into the soil in combination with a spray I used on the exposed flesh with no fuzz.\n\nI alternate my pesticides when using sprays to cover as wide a range of potential pests as possible, and to ensure they don’t become resistant. I prefer to use a perimeter spray after the last expected rain of spring, usually around May or June, and create a barrier around my plants to try and prevent ants from moving in (can you tell I didn’t do that this year?).\n\nWhen bringing home new plants or if I see an active infestation with ants in the soil, I’ll use the typical Bioadvanced 3-in-1 insect, disease, and mite control. The active ingredients are Imidacloprid, Tau-fluvalinate, and Tebuconazole. This is also a systemtic pesticide, so even with rain, it’ll keep working.\n\nFor broader applications and in-ground plants, I use the Complete Insect Killer to help with grubs, fleas, and mosquitoes, which also has Imidacloprid but is paired with Beta-cyfluthrin.\n\nI use the “big guns” for the greenhouse and indoors – TalStar is a long lasting residual pesticide that targets insect nervous systems, causing them to weaken and eventually die. It is not immediately effective, and relies on the bugs walking on or through it, so its not great if you’re looking to immediately knock out an infestation. It works best as a barrier, and before we got chickens, I would spray around the base of my potted plants each year. It is toxic to birds and reptiles, however, so I no longer use it where wildlife or our pet creatures can get near it.\n\nIn my greenhouse, it’s been fantastic as a method for keeping ants out, which have been the biggest issue with my efforts to eliminate mealybugs. It lasts up to 3 months, so I expect to just have to reapply every season since the interior of the greenhouse is sheltered."
