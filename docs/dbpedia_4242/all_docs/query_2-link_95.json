        "text": "I realise this is a late response, but I am leaving this behind for anyone who might come to this question later on.\n\n[EDIT: In addition the advice listed below, it is a good idea to look at this, more thorough answer - How do I identify and control spider mites\n\nI am not a plant expert by any standards whatsoever, but I have dealt with spider mites on my plants. What your approach to spider mites should be, depends on how far gone the infestation is. I have used three different approaches on my plants so far.\n\nWhen the infestation is minor, i.e. you see the mites on the backs of the leaves and you see some webbing but the webbing has not completely covered your plant: Option 1. Take the plant into the bathroom and give it a good shower using the shower head. It helps to lay the plant down on its side , so the spider mites from the leaves and the stalks don't flow back into the soil when you shower it. Once you have done that, also shower the lower parts of the stem and the soil. This is the least invasive method, as you only use water. This option can also be tried for a major infestation, but you should be more prepared in that case to throw out the plant, as this might not work.\n\nOption 2. Also applies to a lower amount of infestation. Take a solution of neem oil and castille soap (or a mild dish soap). Take a cloth dipped in this solution and wipe the leaves and stalks and stems with this solution. If you are also employing the method of using beneficial insects, the neem oil will likely keep away your beneficial insects from the plants. So, do not use this in combination with the beneficial insects method.\n\nOption 3. Throw out your plant. This applies to cases where the spider mites have completely taken over your plant so that there is a lot of webbing covering your plant.\n\nI don’t think individually treating each plant is the best approach - that would need a lot of time and persistence and with a bit of bad luck get you into a cycle of re-infestation where the mites and mealybugs jump from one plant to the next.\n\nThere are two approaches you should consider when you have an infestation in all your plants and throwing them out isn’t an option.\n\nPredators.\n\nFor both of your unwanted cohabitants there are insects available that will happily munch on your pests, predatory mites against the spider mites and lacewings or ladybugs (or relatives) against the mealybugs. A certain identification is a prerequisite, as you will want to match the predators to their future victims. There are online vendors that will ship your armed forces straight to your home and they will also supply you with specific instructions how to release them.\n\nSystemic pesticides.\n\nAs you don’t mind “poisoning” the plants, a systemic pesticide, i.e. something that’s taken up by the plants and then kills the pests when they suck the plants’ sap, is way easier than treating the plant individually with either a topical insecticide or by manually removing them. It will save you the multiple rounds of treatments that are almost guaranteed when your miss a few insects or their eggs hatch. Which product to choose will depend on the pests (as said before: ID is crucial) and your local laws and regulations. Either contact your local garden store or check out the website of a reputable plant chemicals company. Most products should be available online.\n\nThere’s one important thing that should always be considered when a major infestation happens: “Where did it come from and what made the plants susceptible?” You don’t want a repeat scenario a few months down the line. So check your plants needs and what may have made them less resilient. Typical points are humidity (spider mites thrive in dry air) or fertilizer - more isn’t always a good idea, it makes plants “soft”. It can also be clever move to keep new arrivals “quarantined” a bit, so that in case of unwanted hitchhikers you don’t get a “global pandemic”."
