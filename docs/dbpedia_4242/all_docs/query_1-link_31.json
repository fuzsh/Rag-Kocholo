        "text": "How to identify scale on houseplants\n\nScale insects are small, immobile, and often hard-shelled bugs that appear on leaves and stems and suck out vital nutrients from your plants (yeah, kinda gross). This can cause your plants to lose color, vigor, and in extreme cases, death.\n\nThere are two types of scale—armored (hard scale) and unarmored (soft scale). While scale can vary in color, shape and size, the most common type shows as hard brown bumps (armored) on your plant’s leaves and stems. You may also see scale that is white and soft (or unarmored). Keep in mind that because scale latches on to your plant, you will not see it move at all—and removing it thoroughly when there is an infestation can be quite tricky.\n\nWhere does scale come from?\n\nYour plant may get scale from many different places. It could be from another contaminated plant, fresh produce brought home from the farmer’s market, or simply from being simply being outside in the warmer months of the year. It’s often unclear where scale comes from, but also keep in mind that unhealthy or neglected plants can be far more susceptible to pest infestations than their healthier counterparts.\n\nHow to treat scale on houseplants\n\nNeem oil is our go-to natural pesticide solution for all types of pests. Not sure what Neem oil is? Neem oil is incredibly effective at eradicating infestations because it attacks pests at all stages of development, from larvae to adult.\n\nThat said, a full blown scale infestation (because scale, like most common houseplant pests, can reproduce quickly) will require more work than simply dousing with neem oil. You will need to manually remove each scale, and the best way to do this is with rubbing alcohol:\n\nDab a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and pick off the scale bugs one by one\n\nMoisten a paper towel or cotton ball and thoroughly wipe down the more infested areas\n\nContinue to use Neem oil on the leaves, stems and base of the plant\n\nRepeat this once a week for 3-5 weeks, or until you're no longer finding scale on your plant\n\nRecovery will take some time, but be optimistic — indoor plants can be surprisingly resilient. Once you've controlled the issue, your plant will thank you with color and life springing back into their foliage!\n\nNot sure what your plant has is scale? Read our full guide on identifying and treating common pests.\n\nSo you’re dealing with a dying plant\n\nWe’ve all been there. Your plant is dying, it’s possibly not the first time, and you are distressed as to why this keeps happening.\n\nFinding the root cause of why our plants die is crucial to becoming a better plant parent, and one who doesn’t make the same mistake twice! Learn about the factors that can cause an indoor plant to go south, and how to save dying plants in the future.\n\nCommon causes for dying plants\n\nLet’s be real. There are dozens of different reasons your plant could be dying, but 99% of them fall into just a few categories. Let’s narrow them down:\n\nWater. The number one way indoor plants die is by overwatering. While you may love your plant so much and feel inclined to shower it (literally) with love and water, know that most plants need to dry out a bit between waterings in order to thrive. Because overwatering is a quick way to kill your plant, it is always best to err on the side of underwatering, as unlike its opposite, it is pretty difficult to actually kill a plant by simply not watering it. The plant may not look happy, but most will hang on for quite a while with a bit of drought.\n\nLight. This may seem obvious, but certain plants need a certain amount of light. If your plant isn’t getting the light it needs, it may lead to other problems like over watering (see above!) or a higher risk of getting pests (see below!). Be realistic when choosing the right plants for your space, and if you suspect your plant is unhappy due to its light conditions, move it to another space.\n\nPests. Pests like spider mites, mealy bugs, or scale can be a real pain when it comes to indoor plants, especially because we may not notice them until it’s too late. Keep a close eye for the following pests:\n\nMealy bugs. They make white cotton-like masses usually on the underside of leaves.\n\nSpider mites. Too small for the naked eye to see, these pests will leave thin silky webs around your plants foliage and stems.\n\nScale. These may not look like they’re moving, but you will see them all the same as brown, hard-shelled insects that suck the nutrients from your plant’s leaves.\n\nNutrient deficiency. Though this is the least likely cause of plants dying or starting to die, it can lead to a sad looking plant over time. If your plant has not been repotted in many years, and/or if you do not fertilize regularly, your plant may have a nutrient deficiency. Consider repotting your plant to give it fresh soil (from which it gets lots of nutrients!) or incorporate a regular feeding routine with a gentle fertilizer like Boost Vitaminé.\n\nHow to save a dying plant\n\nIf you’ve found the cause of your dying plant, there may still be time to fix it.\n\nOverwatering. Plants that have been severely overwatered may be suffering from root rot, and the only way to save a plant from root rot is repotting. Remove your plant from its pot, remove all the mushy, black roots, and wash the remaining healthy roots thoroughly with water. You may need to repot your plant in a smaller pot if there are not many roots left. Read our full guide on how to treat root rot here. You may also decide to cut off the healthy stems and propagate, using rooting hormone to encourage the growth of a new plant.\n\nPests. There are several solutions to saving a dying plant plagued with pests, but they may vary depending on what you’re treating for. Spider mites and their larvae can be washed away with a steady stream of water, and scale can be removed (painstakingly, one by one!) with alcohol and a q-tip. Very serious infestations may require insecticidal soap. As always, prevention is the best way to avoid pests, and we recommend using neem oil to keep the bugs at bay!\n\nBecomming a successful plant parent\n\nSuccessfully growing your indoor plants is all about keeping staying in tune with your plant and its needs. That means regularly checking on them (beyond simply watering!), learning as you go, and catching any issues or missteps before they become a serious problem. Rest assured that even the greenest of thumbs has killed a plant or two in their lives, and that by no means should you ever give up! Now go forth and keep those plants alive and thriving!\n\nChecked your plant's fronds lately? Aside from watering and dusting, checking for insects from time to time should be part of maintaining your plant's health. Check the undersides of leaves and all the stems. If you spot any thin silky webs, it's likely that a few spider mites have decided to take up residency. Treat the problem ASAP to prevent it from spreading.\n\nWhat are spider mites?\n\nSpider mites, contrary to popular belief, are actually not spiders. They are rather tiny arachnids (that do spin webs, hence “spider” in the name!), that often appear on the undersides of leaves, most commonly in hot and dry conditions. They make large colonies, breed quickly in 1-2 weeks, and feed off plants’ tissue and sap.\n\nHere are a few simple steps to naturally get rid of spider mites:\n\nClean off your plant with a sturdy stream of cold water in your sink, shower, or outdoors with a hose. Thoroughly spray the tops and bottoms of leaves and stems to completely wash away all webs, mites, and eggs.\n\nLet your plant dry off, then treat the infested areas with a natural pesticide like Neem Oil\n\nRepeat this process once a week for three weeks to make sure the mites don't come back\n\nAs mentioned earlier, spider mites often appear when conditions are hot and dry. If this is a regular issue for you, try adding humidity and air circulation to your plant's environment, or using our black olive oil soap as a preventative measure by regularly cleaning your plant with the spray. These pesky critters essentially feed on your plants, draw out their nutrients needed to survive, and cause leaves to drop until the plant eventually dies. Luckily, they're easy to control if caught early!"
