        "text": "What Are Mealybugs?\n\nMealybugs are a tiny, alien-looking insect from the family Pseudococcidae. They often live in colonies and infest plants both indoors and outdoors.\n\nWhat do mealybugs look like? Mealybugs are small, between 1/8 and 1/4 inch long. Mealybugs are sexually dimorphic, meaning the males and females look distinctly different.\n\nFemale mealybugs are the ones youâre likely to notice. They have soft, round bodies and no wings. While their bodies are usually a shade of pink, they often cover themselves with a white, waxy coating that helps protect their bodies from heat and loss of moisture. They usually have white filaments sticking out from their bodies, making them look spiky or bumpy. When the females bunch together on branches, it may look like popcorn.\n\nMale mealybugs look like a completely different species and arenât seen often. Theyâre more like gnats, with a set of wings and four eyes. They arenât covered in wax like the females but often have a long wax tail.Â\n\nSome species of mealybugs can reproduce without mating.\n\nMealybug life cycle. The life cycle of a mealybug will depend on the species.\n\nSome female mealybugs give birth to live young, though most lay eggs. For those that lay eggs, they can lay 200 to 600 at a time. They lay their eggs inside a thick, cottony sack that they usually attach to plant matter like leaves or twigs. These eggs typically take somewhere between three and 16 days to hatch.\n\nWhen the nymphs, called crawlers, first hatch, theyâre usually a shade of yellow, orange, or pink. Not long after birth, they start developing their waxy coating. The nymphs are much more mobile than their adult counterparts, though they look similar to adult females. Theyâll go through several phases in the nymph stage before becoming adults. After laying eggs, the female mealybug dies. Depending on the species, the total life cycle for a mealybug is usually between 23 and 75 days.\n\nTypes of Mealybugs\n\nSo far, over 2,000 species of mealybug have been found worldwide, with about 275 of those living in the U.S. While most of them look similar, some have distinct differences.\n\nCitrus mealybugs (Planococcus citri). Citrus mealybugs are native to Asia but are now found throughout the world. They sometimes have a dark line down their backs. This species feeds on a wide variety of plants, mainly ornamental plants like begonia and tulips, but also on citrus trees. They are the most common mealybug found indoors. Their saliva contains a toxin that may damage plants.\n\nGround mealybug (Rhizoecus falcifer). Ground mealybugs donât live on plants, like most mealybugs, but in the soil. They feed on plant roots, especially roots of African violets and other potted plants.\n\nLongtailed mealybugs (Pseudococcus longispinus). As the name suggests, longtailed mealybugs have a long tail filament. While this species looks like it gives birth to live young, their eggs hatch almost immediately after they are laid. They will eat a wide variety of plants.\n\nMadeira mealybugs (Phenacoccus madeirensis). This species of mealybugs has an incredibly varied diet. Theyâre willing to eat ornamental plants but also fruits, vegetables, and other types of crops. They can damage and deform plants, and their honeydew attracts mold, which causes further damage.\n\nSigns You Have Mealybugs\n\nMealybugs may cause damage to plants, such as wilting, yellowed leaves and stunted growth.Â\n\nMost mealybugs are easy to spot, especially after the first batch of eggs hatches. If your plants are looking ill, check the underside of leaves, the crevice where the leaves meet the stem, and the soil. Mealybugs in these areas might not be as obvious. Keep an eye out for honeydew and black-colored mold.\n\nTo prevent a mealybug infestation, carefully examine all plants before you bring them home, and keep them separate from other plants for about a week. If you often deal with mealybug infestations, consider choosing plants that generally arenât appealing to mealybugs.\n\nThe waxy coating on the mealybug makes it hard for most pesticides to affect them. Systemic insecticides, which are absorbed by plants, are often a better option for mealybugs. When using pesticides or insecticides, follow all instructions and keep them out of the reach of young children and pets."
