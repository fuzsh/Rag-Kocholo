        "text": "Anyone ever deal with these pests? Woke up to my portulacaria afra variegata having about six adults on it. Found some small ones roaming in the soil too. I don't want this to turn into an infestation.. Help?\n\nThis is my first time dealing with any plant parasite, and this is my favorite plant, I don't want it to die!\n\nI usually have had these in conjunction with scales. Mealybugs were easier (for me) to eliminate. I usually resorted to removing any I could see, and completely wiping the plant down with rubbing alcohol.\n\nMealy bugs can are an absolute nightmare. If you've found six, I guarantee there are more. Although I don't like resorting to pesticides, I've had some success with systemics (try Bonide houseplant insect control) in eliminating mealy bug infestations from my Hoyas and Crassulas. The unfortunate truth is, I've never had any success in eliminating mealy bugs by other means. The breed quickly and many plants afford them too many hiding places.\n\nYou might do better with a firm that specializes in \"Biocontrol\" or in \"Biotrol\" as it is sometimes called.\n\nThese are not the giant corporations that have ads up everywhere...\n\nthey are relatively esoteric outfits that are not as easy to find...but they CAN be found over the Internet.\n\nThey breed both predators and parasites for bug pests that include mealybugs and scales.\n\nPerhaps googling \"Biocontrol\" would help you to locate them.\n\nThanks for the advice. Yeah, been finding one or two big females every week or two, so I know there are more. I'll try out those products carefully and see if they help!\n\nI had a small infestation on my Adenium. I hand-picked most of them that I could find, and left the plant outside so coccinellids/lacewings could get to it. Most of them were eliminated but I had to bring the plant in for a couple of cold weeks and they re-multiplied... But I think low populations could be destroyed this way.\n\nWith many insects for safe non toxic and organic pest control use diatomacious earth also called diatom powder, it is safe enough to coat dogs with, and is easily obtained and works well on many insects all the way up to grasshoppers. Especially something small like mealy bugs, and scale, both of which are pains. Plus it wont leave any residue to hurt your tarantulas once you wash it off."
