        "meta_description": "Parasitic plants have been known to be attacked by insect pests since ancient times. However, little is known about the mealybug (Hemiptera, Coccomorpha, Pseudococcidae) fauna associated with them. A series of surveys of mealybugs found on Loranthaceae, a semi-parasitic plant family, was conducted in several places in Bengkulu Province, southern Sumatra, Indonesia. In the study, 55 mealybug specimens were collected, consisting of eight species belonging to five genera, namely Chorizococcus McKenzie (1 species), Dysmicoccus Ferris (2 species), Ferrisia Fullaway (1 species), Planococcus Ferris (3 species) and Pseudococcus Westwood (1 species). Chorizococcus ozeri Zarkani &amp; Kaydan, sp. nov. is new to science, whilst Planococcus bagmaticus Williams represents the first record in Indonesia. In addition, the mealybugs Dysmicoccus lepelleyi (Betrem), Dysmicoccus zeynepae Zarkani &amp; Kaydan, Ferrisia dasylirii (Cockerell), Planococcus lilacinus (Cockerell) and Pseudococcus jackbeardsleyi Gimpel &amp; Miller are newly recorded from plants of the family Loranthaceae. Figures and illustrations of mealybug species with a taxonomic key to Asian Chorizococcus and a new country record based on morphological characters are also updated.",
