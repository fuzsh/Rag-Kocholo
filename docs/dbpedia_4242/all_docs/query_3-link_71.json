Attracted to and often lay eggs on the mealybugs' waxy secretions and egg cases.\n\nCryptolaemus montrouzieri is a member of the Coccinellid Beetle family, commonly known as ladybugs, and recognized by their distinctive round, dome shape. These Mealybug Destroyers have a dark brown body with orange head and tail, and are about 4mm in size. Both the adults and larvae target Mealybugs at all life stages. Eggs are laid near colonies of mealybugs and hatch within 5-7 days. The young larvae emerge as small, white, and fuzzy - resembling mealybugs. After 14-20 days and undergoing several molts, the larvae enter the pupal stage and emerge as adults with a lifespan of 4-6 weeks. Both adult beetles and larvae continue to feed on mealybugs until temperatures become unfavorable. Cryptolaemus montrouzieri cannot endure sub-freezing temperatures, and it’s necessary to reintroduce them after low or freezing temperatures."
