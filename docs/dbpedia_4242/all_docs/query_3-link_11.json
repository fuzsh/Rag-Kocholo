        "text": "In field crops, hosts are primarily peanut, cotton, mungbean and sunflower. Mealybugs are also found in a wide range of horticultural crops, garden plants and weed species.\n\nCan affect any plant stage but is often difficult to detect until colonies are well advanced. Often:\n\ninfestations are close to paddock edges or in poorly drained areas\n\nin peanuts, colonies are found at the base of plants on the taproot and pods.\n\nin cotton, early infestations of solenopsis mealybug cause 'hotspots' of dead plants."
