        "text": "“Thank you, Friend of Medjugorje! My husband and I have been wrestling with this for quite some time. Now more than ever, we have been seeing greater signs of complacency and indifference. When I recently asked a priest why we are not hearing more from the pulpit, in regard to moral issues, the pope’s opposite teachings and examples, etc., I was told that Pope Francis says that the homilies need to focus on the Gospel and bringing the people peace. Also, I was told that they have to be careful on how they approach moral matters. Why? They were not careful telling me the truth when I was being educated. Like it or not, the truth was told and morals were clearly defined. Your writing is with accuracy and aligns with what my husband and I have been seeing. With the complacency at hand, we are now dealing with a much bigger mess. Truth needs to be clearly revealed NOW. There is no reason to pacify the pope’s erroneous teachings (nor anyone else). Truth does not sway; it must be told with vigor! It must be followed by Biblical teachings, by the One True Doctrine of Faith! We pray for God’s mercy to be upon us and for many conversions to take place. We pray for our shepherds and for clarity in truth—for our eyes and ears to be opened, the fog removed leaving only the One True Faith! We pray for them to lead us on the path of righteousness via the Bible’s teachings. Our Lady reaffirms this in Her messages. As you have mentioned before that if Our Lady of Medjugorje is the last stop, we do not have time to evaluate it before the period of Grace is over and the critical nature of the messages are upon us. What will this hurt??? Obviously, there is so much evidence (even agreed by scientists, in regard to the supernatural involvement); there is so much love, peace and conversion. The enemy is at hand and we must carefully discern. However, by now, we can see that the enemy can not bring such peace and love as has been bestowed upon the people via Our Lady and Her messages in Medjugorje. If this is of God, it will not leave us; however, the time of Grace is upon us and will not be here forever. And so far, 40 years have remained. Let us not ignore Our Lord and Our Lady any further. We can plainly see that not acknowledging it for what it is has certainly kept our country from being a better place, not to mention the salvation of souls that could have transpired. Let us not wait any longer. May the Divine Intervention of Our Lord and Our Lady be upon us! God bless you all and thank you for your love and genuine commitment to Our Lord and Our Lady!”\n\nC.B.\n\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\n“It is truly a shame that our bishops and Church did not educate their flock about their responsibility as Catholics to vote in accordance with Jesus’ teaching and Church teachings. A few in my extended family voted for Biden and I was unable to convince them otherwise because they had been indoctrinated by the media and untruths spoken in our culture. If the priests and bishops had done their job and guided the flock, many would have voted responsibly but silence gave permission to vote for Biden. And the silence continues to allow him to “act” like a Catholic, attend mass and receive Communion. He and the other people in high office should be excommunicated without hesitation. They are a disgrace to the Catholic faith. Thank God we have a Friend of Medjugorje to give all of us a voice and speak what we hold in our hearts. We must continue this message and share with all we know. We are so grateful to have our Holy Mother with us to teach us and guide us. Let us pray as She says for the shepherds. We need them to hear us and lead us. Thank you, Friend of Medjugorje and God bless you and the community.”\n\nLW.\n\nHouston, Texas\n\n“While reading this and based on the ‘Friend of Medjugorje’s’ proclamation that he is not a highly educated man, It is inconceivable to not be aware that the Holy Spirit wrote these words through him. The eloquence of this statement is sublime (and long overdue).”\n\nM.H.\n\nCedar Rapids, Iowa\n\n“My wife and I are very strong Conservatives and strong believers in the Catholic Church. We have followed the visionaries since the 90’s because of a Friend of Medjugorje.\n\n“We were very disappointed with our Catholic bishops supporting President Biden, knowing how he feels about abortion and certain marriages. For Biden to want unity in America and killing 11,000 jobs on Day 1 was insane, un-American. He has already signed over 25 Executive Orders in two days. We pray for Biden to wake up before America destroys itself. May God have mercy on us. God bless a Friend of Medjugorje and Caritas. Stay strong.”\n\nJ.G.\n\nNew Deal, Texas\n\n“Amen!”\n\nB.\n\nArgos, Indiana\n\n“Praise be Jesus! It is about time someone stood up and said it like it is. May God bless you. Mother pray for us.”\n\nM.R.\n\nLubbock, Texas\n\n“It breaks my heart so much to know that there is now a President in the White House who hates the gift of God’s babies. I try to do as much as I can to help the little ones by praying for them, signing petitions and helping friends who want an abortion. I hate the word and would happily do what I could, in excess of what I have already done, if it were possible. If I lived in America it might be easier but where I live it is more difficult. I just know it breaks my heart now that Trump has left and the babies no longer have a champion. They have a killer in the White House now!”\n\nJ.—North Hamptonshire\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n“Beautifully written. Prayer and fasting, as requested by our Blessed Mother, will be our salvation if we only follow Her requests. I have been to Medjugorje twice, and have been blessed to have been present during two apparitions. Highlights of my life. This is the eleventh hour, and it is now or never for the conversion of souls. The bishops need to lead their flocks. We, the believers, will support them when they follow God’s Commandments. Do not be afraid. Lead by example. Many will follow.”\n\nS.M.\n\nRancho Cucamonga, California\n\n“Ever notice that those with the courage to give a STRONG homily—are the RETIRED PRIESTS, filling in for a pastor. They no longer fear the feedback of those upset by THE TRUTH! For some reason I have admired COURAGE! The courage of ‘Students for Life,’ a good example, whom I donate to and thank God for!! I have found that you need to Pray ‘ASK THE HOLY SPIRIT’ for the courage – to do God’s Will for you!!!”\n\nD.P.\n\nFrazee, Minnesota\n\n“Right on. The Bishops should tell their sheep Joe Biden & Nancy Pelosi are excommunicated from the Catholic Church. In 1991, I visited Medjugorje and returned to Church after being away for 15 years. What is wrong with these bishops!!”\n\nP.B.\n\nWakefield, Massachusetts\n\n“Decades of discernment as clear as day and the fruit of prayer and fasting. Truth is Truth and Light is Light. This is not just a USA problem. Thank you for your strength and leadership. God bless the Community of Caritas.”\n\nEric\n\nScotland\n\n“Thank you for such a justified upbraiding. We should have taken these men to task years ago. Biden has just refunded International Planned Parenthood, and committed our tax dollars to pay for it. satan has surely taken over control of our country, but we both know that God is stronger than satan. Thank you for giving the bishops fodder to chew and I hope and pray that they accept this as positive feedback that they have earned. May God have mercy on them. Now I understand much better why our Churches are losing membership and financial support. May God bless you and the family of Caritas.”\n\nLarry\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\n\n“If I were a bishop, I’d sure take another look at my actions (or inaction) and consider immediate changes. Well done and well expressed. Even I understood all of it. Our Lady must be happy with you as Her Apostle. Biden has now reversed President Trump’s protections against abortion and is making taxpayers pay the cost. God help us. I’ve set on Church boards several times, charged with the task of determining the cause of people leaving the Church and not contributing financially or morally toward the welfare of the Church. You’ve opened my eyes and I feel more prepared for the future if I’m ever asked to sit on a board again. God bless you, and the family of Caritas.”\n\nLarry\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\n\n“Great writing! Exactly to the point! Fasting and praying for all shepherds. Thank you, a Friend of Medjugorje and Caritas Community for all you do for Our Lady of Medjugorje Queen of Peace.”\n\nF.R.\n\nCleveland, Texas.\n\n“I wanted to cheer and shout. Exactly what they need to hear. I am waiting for action from them. I am so tired of hearing about their meetings that mean nothing to us. So we’ll spoken. Thank you. Lead us on, I cannot wait.”\n\nE.H.\n\nGrand Idle, Louisiana\n\n“Thank you once again, and again, and yet again, for your inspired writings. ‘Way back about 1960 (when I spent a few years in a Catholic seminary) the prophetic word was making the rounds that ‘the time of the laity was upon us’ and the standard (deliberately innocuous) interpretation given was that the laity was then to be given more activity in ecclesiastical functions (this because at that day it was very true that most lay people left everything up to the clergy, even Catholic education of children). We all know about what the ever-present satanic influence did to this concept (for only one example, extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist); in fact, I have seen this concept in print in a church document as ‘extra ordinary ministers’ and I still see priests sitting down or standing behind the altar while others distribute the Eucharist. OK. We are where we are. But back to the prophetic word: I myself did not realize at the time that what was actually meant and prophetic was that the majority of the Catholic clergy would soon come to abdicate their responsibilities, and that Our Lady would be right there to fill up the gap by using the peons in the pews. It’s time to put my name and address on the line as being 120% behind this writing.”\n\nMurph\n\nMilton-Freewater, OR\n\n“Nice going Terry sounds like truth to me especially the part that struck me they never opened up the Churches to our Lady of Medjugorje! Praise be to Jesus, Our Lady Queen of Peace be with us protect us and pray for us. Thank you for your Fiat.”\n\nM.B.\n\nMithtown, New York\n\n“At Mass last weekend, the priest, who is traditional and one of two beautiful priests at our parish in Baton Rouge, read the ‘Prayer for Our Government’ written in 1791 by the first bishop in America, Bishop John Carroll, whose prayer to God was to endow the gifts of the Holy Spirit on our government and government leaders. Immediately following that prayer from Bishop John Carroll, the priest read a letter written by our Bishop of Baton Rouge to all Church parishes, reinforcing the use of face masks and social distancing!!! I exclaimed out loud ‘What a contrast!’ Where are our shepherds, O Lord?”\n\nMarie\n\nBaton Rouge, Louisiana\n\n“Yes, a fire needs to be set!! Mary has come to quiet us with the WORD of GOD!!”\n\nG.W.—Sooke,\n\nBritish Columbia, Canada\n\n“Thank you, Queen Virgin Mother, for giving AFOM the grace to speak and witness the TRUTH of the HOLY TRINITY.”\n\nF.V.\n\nAbbeville, Louisiana\n\n“An amazing piece. I learned so much from this writing. It saddened me when New York passed the late-term abortion law and the law makers stood and applauded with not retribution from the Church. Also, when California passed laws favorable to pedophiles with the Church remaining silent. All I could think of was Sodom and Gomorrah right here in our country.”\n\nJanice\n\nOdell, Illinois\n\n“THANK YOU! I felt like getting up and cheering that someone finally said it as it is. I hope and pray that Our Lady cleans out the hierarchy… they are doing such a disservice to the flock. Their duplicity and ‘nuanced’ approach is sickening. So thank you for clearly stating the truth. May Our Lady and Our Lord bless you and keep you and give you peace, and give us wisdom and peace as we fight the good fight – without our bishops. THEY are the problem!!!”\n\nK.M.\n\n“I could not believe that our bishops had gone so low until a friend sent me this Facebook message from Bishop John Stowe this afternoon. I was sick at heart. To speak about My Biden as a noble and honorable man when he promotes abortion and [abominable] marriages, it’s hypocrisy!!! He goes against everything our Church believes! He promotes sin against the people, the Commandments, against God!! I am worried for our Church, for our nation, for the souls of our leaders!!!”\n\nVicki\n\nSt. Charles, Missouri\n\n“I just went to Confession on Saturday and I Confessed to our priest that I am currently helping my daughter. She has to live with me at the moment, but she brought her fiance because they had nowhere to live (they lost their jobs). I wanted to Confess my part in contributing to their mortal sin. The priest told me that it was OK because this is the culture! I asked, ‘But does GOD say this is ok?’ I totally see what AFOM is saying. I am so grateful that my mother visited Medjugorje years ago. I am new to this website and group, but I am learning so much. I plan to print this and give it to our bishop and priest. I printed the previous writings from AFOM and gave my priest the book They Fired the First Shot. I really hope he reads it.”\n\nM.B.\n\nBeaumont, Texas\n\n“God Bless you FOM. A true message of love and a convicting message. Reminds me of many of Our Lady’s messages. (September 2, 2013)”\n\nT.S.\n\nFort Loramie, Ohio\n\n“The Friend of Medjugorje is wise in this writing about the Church and the bishops. We are all sinner’s and in need of repentance and forgiveness. I left the Roman Catholic Church right around the time the Blessed Virgin began appearing at Medjugorje for reasons I don’t care to divulge. Unfortunately, the bishops have bought into what the world has to offer rather than buying into the Word of God. I may be way off base when I say this, but I firmly believe that the reason none of the so called ‘Catholics’ who are in power in Washington D.C. is they are too powerful, and the bishops are afraid of losing their 501(c)(3) tax exempt status. All of us, no matter which religious denomination we belong to, need to focus on God and what an important role the Blessed Virgin Mary has played and continues to play in all of our lives. I pray that the bishop’s come to their senses and believe that the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin are real and that they allow those sitting in the pews to come to know God’s work in the world today. Blessings on your ministry.”\n\nT.M.\n\nPalm Coast, Florida\n\n“Wow! I am so happy to have read this. Finally, a dumb slap in our faces to wake us up. It is all our faults that we are asleep in the pews. Because we let our bishops and priests not speak of, or to get us all involved in the hardest of subjects. We all need courage to defend our God-given human rights to life and liberty. Have no fear because our God is always near. Thank you to Mary our Loving Mother.”\n\nVicki—Massachusetts\n\n“WOW! This is AWESOME! Yes, I am copying and sending this to my local cardinal, former President Of the USCCB. Now is the time, backed by Our Lady through much, much prayer, penance, fasting and Her messages to show moral courage, No Matter What! Thank you, Caritas and Terry Colafrancesco, for your faithful witness and convictions in this our great time of need! Thank you for your witness and tirelessly getting out those Great Messages. I am now clinging to them like a life preserver and through the Holy Rosary am now beginning to find peace amid sooo much confusion. This question has been on my mind lately, given all this horrible news of evil seeming to prevail everywhere, even in Holy Mother the Church. What does a Faithful Catholic do, where do I go, when even some of my seemingly faithful Catholic friends and my family, too seem to just lay down, lick their wounds, roll over and say, Well, it’s ‘God’s Will.’ Let’s obey, put our mask on and go along to get along hoping and praying for better times. Our Lady’s messages say different, as does this writing. Thanks for giving this poor soul a sense of direction and sooo much peace and joy! I am not afraid of whatever the future holds because in the end, ‘Mary’s Immaculate Heart Will Triumph’ God’s Love to Caritas, Our Lady’s First Apostles”\n\nL.S.\n\nHouston, Texas\n\n“Amen. Also, I know of so many Catholics getting the coronavirus vaccine, that is tainted with aborted babies and has metals in it. (We have the Moderna one here.) Have had no direction or instruction from our bishop or priests. When I try to tell our friends, they don’t believe me.”\n\nRenetta—Kentucky\n\n“AMEN and likewise for the bishops of Australia!”\n\nM.T.\n\nElizabeth, Australia\n\n“Blind to your wrong and deaf to the Holy Spirt it seems most shepherds seem to be . We all are on the via Dolorosa our Shepard Christ our Redeeming King went before us. As a lamb led to the slaughter. His example we are to follow. Three crosses on that hill our Savior with outstretched arms offered salvation to both. A free will choice to ask for forgiveness, one chooses wisely. Do we listen to the Truth revealed by the Holy Spirit? Do our bishops listen or are we being driven as sheep without shepherds into prediction by the devil and his minions? The Lion of Judah, Christ the Lamb of God will rule in His Glory. Our Queen and Mother is preparing His apostles for His return. May the Queen of Peace protect us with Her mantle.\n\nThank you, Caritas, for stepping up and out in all that you do. Viva Cristo Rey!”\n\nJ.J.\n\nRock Hill, SC\n\n“I sure hope all hear and listen and understand what you have been doing. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I ask God for forgiveness. For strength to do His will. For courage to remain faithful. May the Queen of Peace reign soon, thank you Sweet Mary our Mother, thank you God our Father, thank you Jesus our Friend and Brother, and thank you Holy Spirit and May You dwell in us all.\n\nP.S. I love what you are doing! Blessing on you, thank you. Our Mother in Heaven and here on earth is so beautiful. I wish all to know Her, She loves and heals and helps everyone who ask. Thank you and thank Her and also the Father in Heaven for letting Her come and stay with us She is the best Teacher in the whole wide world. Love and thanks.”\n\nA.F.\n\nHemphill, Texas\n\n“Finally…thank you. Outstanding message.”\n\nBeth\n\nFishersville, VA\n\n“Another awesome writing, direct from your heart to the world. It is time for me to grow some backbone and confront the bishops over here. I did a timid contact with the local priest not wanting to offend out of respect about one to two years ago that failed miserably. If this writing and a CD of one or two of the broadcasts doesn’t wake them up, then I don’t know what will. I will include my favorite that woke me up – the 2018 Special World Report ‘Our Lady’s Here Because Of What Is Coming Out Of The Church,’ plus the one about Our Lady’s Apostles mission mentioned in this writing called ‘Fables, Bipolar, Church Leaders’ from February 2019. Thank you AFOM, may God bless you and your family plus all at Caritas of Birmingham. I too believe the Secrets aren’t too far away which will start to fix this big mess of a world. Thank you AFOM for listening to Our Lady’s call and creating these broadcasts and writings. I look forward to them every week and will miss them when Our Lady’s messages stop as assuming your mission may change then too.”\n\nDavid—Gillieston Heights, Australia\n\n“I believe that no one genuinely wants to make mistakes. Unfortunately, they happen for a variety of reasons. And at this point, admit the mistakes, repent, and move quickly and do the right thing, before it is too late. Follow Mary and Her Messages. If one is in an important position, forget your reputation. What’s more important your reputation or your eternal life? AFOM is extremely knowledgeable and has a deep understanding and insight into the messages. Maybe it’s time to take him up on his offer to visit Caritas. Please, move quickly time is running out. God Bless to All.”\n\nJoanne\n\nLivonia, Michigan\n\n“I too am perplexed that the Catholic Church does not openly relay the messages of Our Lady. Does it not believe them to be true? It seems not. I too believe if these messages were spread throughout the Churches of the world, true conversion would happen on a mammoth scale and so many more people will be saved.”\n\nMichael Pater\n\nBerwick, Victoria , Australia\n\n“I support the recommendations and spiritual truths of this letter. These messages spoken by Our Blessed Mother are for everyone in our Church are critically important. As bishops, the shepherds of the Church, we need your leadership and guidance, listen to Mary or the consequences will be devastating.”\n\nEduardo Fraga\n\nMiami, Florida\n\n“Strength through courage, thank you Friend of Medjugorje.”\n\nMarvalee\n\nMaricopa, Arizona\n\n“I agree wholeheartedly with you. We have been waiting…and waiting….and waiting for good priests, bishops, cardinals and the pope to stand for truth and we have not received it. Woe to them who could have spoken, but did not speak, who could have saved others, but did not take one action to save. Whitewashed tombs and filled with dead mans bones!”\n\nJeanette A. Coury\n\nHouston, Texas\n\n“If all bishops stood together against the degradation and persecution of our Catholic faith that is happening not only in the secular world, but sadly also within our own Church, then many conversions would occur, and Catholics would once again have faith in their spiritual leaders.”\n\nMaria Eckl\n\nFlorence, Alabama\n\n“THANK YOU, a Friend of Medjugorje, for this beautiful, necessary letter to our bishops. May they all read it prayerfully and take action. Our Lady has been waiting 40 years! May Jesus bless us all and help us to follow Blessed Mother with the Rosary in our hands. It’s not too late. May God give us all the grace we need. God bless.”\n\nMrs. Linda Marie Prince\n\nWilmington, Delaware\n\n“Sign me up!”\n\nAustin Blanchard\n\nSterrett, Alabama\n\n“I Stand Strongly with a Friend of Medjugorje and all that is written here. TRUTH!!!”\n\nRuth McDonald\n\nSterrett, Alabama\n\n“Thank you for saying what no one else in the world will say. I’m proud to be part of a Friend of Medjugorje’s defining and leading the Medjugorje phenomenon for the entire world. Spread this. Start speaking up like a Friend of Medjugorje – tell your bishop and others that evil is evil and that stupid is stupid.”\n\nJason Terrell\n\nCaritas, Alabama\n\n“I wish our Churches were overflowing and people would come together in great numbers to pray. Rip off the masks, fill the pews, and keep the faith!!! We had one priest tell us to not come to Church if we are not wearing a mask. I love Church. I no longer feel comfortable there. I keep going.”\n\nRachelle Blackman\n\nDeland, Florida\n\n“I am a Permanent Deacon in Brigantine, New Jersey, and I am all in!”\n\nLeonard Long\n\nGalloway, New Jersey\n\n“Promise to fast more, pray more and stay true to my Lord by following the Ten Commandments. I pray for all our priests and all my brothers and sisters in Christ and especially those who do not believe and are causing havoc, those who are lukewarm in their faith and those who are not practicing Catholics. Thank you, our Dear Blessed Mother and Holy Trinity.”\n\nMarie Ram\n\nChino Hills, California\n\n“Bishops, wake up and lead us.”\n\nMarge Barton\n\nFenton, Missouri\n\n“Thank you for this writing!”\n\nJodie Faltysek\n\nEast Bernard, Texas\n\n“Thank you, a Friend of Medjugorje, for this much needed writing. I pray our bishops will read it all and act on it. I am so disgusted and disheartened by most of the leaders in the Church. I trust in our Lord Jesus Christ and I believe in the messages of our Blessed Mother. O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. Crush the plans of satan under your heel. God bless all of you at Caritas.”\n\nJeri Gumerson\n\nGreenwood, Indiana\n\n“The information stated in the letter to the US bishops needed to be said to them. Only hope they will pay attention, open their souls to the Queen of Peace and change.”\n\nDaniel Kortes\n\nNew Baltimore, Michigan\n\n“I cannot believe any bishop would give Communion to anyone who approves abortion.”\n\nJackie Ramnarong\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana\n\n“Time and thought was given to this writing…a well written writing. As I was reading this, I was thinking of all the years of praying the 7-7-7 prayers for our bishops. They truly are blind in many ways. Blind in that they cannot see how we truly need them to lead us. Blind in how we have waited for them to take a lead for so long. Blind in their call. Blind in that their flocks wait to no avail, hoping beyond hope. AVAIL…do you realize the Latin meaning of that world…from Latin valere be strong, be of value. I guess that says it all. Thank you, a Fiend of Medjugorje for penning this. The Holy Spirit inspired you perfectly in showing their blindness.”\n\nSherry Hittle\n\nIda Grove, Iowa\n\n“Queen of Peace Please bless all.”\n\nDee Logsdon\n\nSpringfield, Kentucky\n\n“I learned so much from your message. I applaud you for your words. I wish our priests would speak out against what is going on today: the late-term abortions in New York, the laws passed In California.”\n\nJanice Hirsch\n\nOdell, Illinois\n\n“Please bishops, sand up for the teachings of Our Lord Jesus Christ. I am no one, but I am everyone who is watching their beloved Catholic Church fall into ruin. We need you to shepherd us, His flock. We will stand with you in His Truth. You are under the protection of Our Lady’s Mantle. Be not afraid.”\n\nDeb\n\nRomeoville, Illinois\n\n“Wow, if this writing doesn’t convict the bishops and priests of how their silence is misleading their flocks, I don’t know what will. Specially not calling out Biden, Pelosi, and the rest as poor Catholic examples for the country and the world. God bless you for always speaking the truth and not being afraid. My prayer group is always praying for our priests and bishops and the pope to know the Truth. I pray this works.”\n\nMary Rausser\n\nSomers, New York\n\n“Thank you, Mary, Mother of God. God’s Will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.”\n\nLois Opincar\n\nAvon Lake, Ohio\n\n“I support the request to accept Medjugorje as true and authentic. I ask the USCCB to join in this acceptance NOW!”\n\nKathy Winner\n\nMinster, Ohio\n\n“WOW! Thank you for making everything crystal clear! You have not judged, but rather courageously rebuked our Church leaders. I pray that they will ask for the intercession of St. Romero, who abandoned his comfortable priesthood and became the voice of the people.\n\n“If Jesus, the Son of God, was obedient to Mary and Joseph, who are we not to do the same, especially those who were given authority within the Church! So, I dare to say—not if, but when our Church leaders choose to run to Our Lady, Queen of Peace, She will multiply the graces, undo the knots, and usher in an era of peace! God bless us all!”\n\nCarolyn Montenegro\n\nHopewell Junction, New York\n\n“Thank you and God bless you!”\n\nMychelle Davis\n\nElllijay, Georgia\n\n“This writing powerfully defines what many of us have been feeling.”\n\nJill Finkenbine\n\nMaplewood, Ohio\n\n“Thank you, a Friend of Medjugorje, for the good work you are doing for Mother Mary the Queen of Peace.

I did the nine-day bread and water fast…I am praying all the time for our Mother Mary to help us. My mother and grandmother were very devoted to Her…Thank you for all you do and all your information. God Bless You All.”\n\nBarbara Heizmann\n\nOak Hill, Florida\n\n“Amen!”\n\nAnn Willenbring\n\nRichmond, Minnesota\n\n“For years I had questions about what some bishops were saying or not doing. This is evidence that my and others’ fears were not unfounded. I’ll be praying and fasting that the bishops that need them will be humble and courageous enough to repent and have God smiling on them once again. Stay strong, Friend of Medjugorje, and Thank you.”\n\nMargaret Grossman\n\nBenson, Minnesota\n\n“Add my name to the list for the bishops.”\n\nSusana G. Fullerton\n\nKents Store, Virginia\n\n“Thank you, Friend of Medjugorje! My love and prayers are with you and the Community.”\n\nSharon Allende\n\nFountain Valley, California\n\n“Absolutely wonderful article and filled with truth. I am ashamed in front of non-Catholics to call our current politicians ‘Catholic.’ How outrageous! Shepherds need to lead their flock with powerful sermons and not get quiet at election time (orders from the bishops) because of fear of being ‘political.’ Life is the most important issue, period.”\n\nBarbara Heagy\n\nMilton, Delaware\n\n“To the bishops, understand the time has come! You were chosen to shepherd His people, but you have become another Judas of our times. Mary called out to Judas in his day, but he would not listen, your actions of nonaction condemns you. You have not recognized the time of your visitation. Otherwise, you would have repented and turned from your wicked ways. St. Michael the Archangel said to lucifer, God be your Judge. So I, as a Friend of Medjugorje, say the same to you!”\n\nKathie Jackson\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma\n\n“This writing so precisely summarized all my thoughts on this issue, much better than I could have ever done. Our bishops need to have courage and stand up! Of the 12 apostles, one was a traitor, ten were cowards (at least initially) and only one was courageous throughout. That is about the same ratio of our bishops today. Here is hoping those 10 out of 12 cowards find their courage!!”\n\nMike Albertone\n\nWilloughby Hills, Ohio\n\n“Unfortunately, our shepherds are silent. Thank you for giving us voice. I agree with you. Thank you.”\n\nEugene Morales\n\nHumble, Texas\n\n“Eloquently written! Two sets of books! I.e. two versions of the Twelve Commandments? First version for the peasant flock.\n\nSecond version for the Church hierarchy and politicians.”\n\nRon\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\n“A reminder to all us peasants in the pews who have been to Medjugorje…We must live the messages and bring Medjugorje HERE!!!! God bless you, and the Caritas Community, for speaking TRUTH and witnessing to all with your lives.”\n\nJ.J.\n\nWoodbury, Minnesota\n\n“Extraordinary piece. I was happy to see that the bishops responded by criticizing Biden, but until they act it’s only words. The bishops unfortunately aren’t the only ones that are guilty. So is the head of the Catholic Church, our pope. May God hear the prayers of the faithful and may Our Lady continue to help us.”\n\nLinda\n\nJoliet, Illinois\n\n“Thank you for always speaking the truth. Our nation is certainly in a very bad spot as most Catholics believe what is “preached” to them instead of what is Divinely inspired in them as truth. It is a sad day for our nation that we have to endure Joe Biden’s presidency and all the harm that it will bring, but with your voice out there we will have a beacon of light to follow. May God bless you and everyone at Caritas for putting your lives on notice for all of us.”\n\nL.G.\n\nRochester, New York\n\nYes, the Church hierarchy has failed us. With the prophesies from Fatima and with Medjugorje. I see a revival in other Christian denominations, but not here in our Catholic Church. Our flock lacks leadership. As Mother Mary continues to tell us pray, pray, pray.”\n\nTom\n\nBelmont, NH\n\nWe have followed Our Lady’s Messages from the beginning and have presented ourselves in Medjugorje. With a strong and fervent belief in Her Messages our lives have been changed. We, too, are disgusted and dismayed at the lack of leadership from our Bishops and Cardinals. Our fervent, daily prayer is for the conversion of hearts, salvation of souls, and an end to the lukewarmness which exists in our Church and its members. May god have Mercy on us and our country!\n\nF.K.D.\n\nWheaton, Illinois\n\nDear A Friend of Medjugorje,\n\n“This is a must read for all the bishops with little time that is left and that they may change their course of direction to allow Our Lady to help bring about many souls to conversions. Your conviction and the truth of this writing should be an eye-opener for majority of the bishops who needs to be spiritually awaken. We, the sheep in the pews, are demanding for a change to remove all darkness and false conflicting actions by your inactions and by our sinful ways we have allowed darkness to infiltrate the Church. We continue to pray for you in hopes you heed the warnings. We are all sinners, no judgment, but only pleas, for many souls are at stake. Let Our Lady guide us all!\n\n“Thank you, A Friend of Medjugorje (Community of Caritas and Birmingham), for living Our Lady’s messages and helping us all along the way to strive to live and imitate into our way of living. We love Our Lady and Mother and give ourselves under Her care to be Her extended hands. Glory and thanks be to God in this time of Grace by Her presence and guidance. Thank you, Blessed Mother, for guiding us for 40 years! May God bless us all!”\n\nWith Love and Prayers,\n\nC.C. of Texas\n\n“God bless you Friend of Medjugorje and the Community of Caritas. Tirelessly, you work, pray unceasingly, and strictly fast according to Our Lady’s instructions. Our shepherds’ fasts are a joke in comparison. I am so grateful and thankful for your presence in my life. O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to You. I surrender myself and my will to Jesus, my Lord & Savior. I have much to atone for but with God’s guidance, the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and the Eucharist, I will be armed with the resolve to follow Our Blessed Lady’s Messages and follow her instructions.”\n\nThank You so Much,\n\nSusan—Lake City, Florida\n\n“Praying and fasting”\n\nPrae\n\n“No, we are not to judge, but we can be fruit inspectors! Thanks Friend of Medjugorje for doing just that. Heard on Truth Broadcasting—they have 10 radio stations in these states: NC, Utah, Iowa, Virginia. Contact them and ask them to read this letter over the air. I did. So many Catholics RINOS on all levels of government profane our faith to our embarrassment. We’ll be doing another nine-day bread and water fast and three-hour Eucharistic Adoration. I had the grace of three hours of prayer today, but this is not always the case.”\n\nM.N.\n\nHarrisonburg, VA\n\n“Extraordinary!!! Brave and clear as it is will print it and go to my Bishop to give him a copy. If he does not speak English will offer him to translate in any form that would be needed. We must stop being cowards and letting our shepherds to be so!!! This false pandemic is taking so many out of discernment and Our Lady´s messages are needed more than ever to convict and convert. Thanks a lot to a Friend of Medjugorje for this writing.”\n\nB.S.\n\nCiudad Obregón,\n\nSonora, Mexico\n\n“Thank you, Friend of Medjugorje. It needed to be said. Unfortunately, they won’t even bat an eye! Their only hope is for a sincere conversion at the time of the Warning which, by the way, is just around the corner. We all need to be strong now. Get to Confession…pray, pray, pray! Peace to all here.”\n\nPeter\n\nMontana\n\n“Everything I read is 1,000% true. God help our shepherds. They want to be popular among the people rather than say it like it is. Sin is sin no matter how you slice it.”\n\nM.S.\n\nBerlin, NJ\n\n“AMEN.”\n\nS.E.\n\nTraverse City, Michigan\n\n“Thank you for writing this. I agree with every word.”\n\nJ.L.\n\nKnoxville, Tennessee\n\n“Our Lady, definitely, spoke of politics at Fatima, she said consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart. First Fridays. First Saturdays. Our Lady obviously is political. And yes, Our Lady is a Trump supporter. If these people say otherwise it is because they are drinking fluoride in the water. They might not be red pilled. Q is totally Christian. I believe the Mother of God is on the side of Trump. It’s obvious if you have heard of the Weiner laptop that God, Himself, has stopped the evil one from the HRC third Obama administration. It’s so plain that the Left is deceived.”\n\nJuliet\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\n“Amen.”\n\nAngela\n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\n“Thank you! Excellent! I have never understood why such silence from our Church. May we listen to Her words and our Church open the doors to the Queen of Peace. Mother Mary be a Mother to me now.”\n\nA.\n\nMiami, Florida\n\n“Thank you AFOM for your writings. I feel all are called with a special purpose, we are all soldiers of Christ and our Rosary is our sword.”\n\nMarianne\n\nRockport, Indiana\n\n“Thank you for another great writing! I am going to send this out to several priests I know. We need Our Lady and Medjugorje more than ever!”\n\nA.G.\n\nNiagara Falls, New York\n\n“As I have mentioned before: ‘I’m worried about my judgement day for transgressions that I was not aware are sins. How much more the Bishops should be worried, they have received all the teachings of Jesus!! Those of whom much is given, much is expected.” I hope that this writing is sent to ALL the bishops in the USA. They have failed us miserably. May God have mercy on them. I will print this out and send to my bishop and it will probably be read by a subordinate and then thrown away. I might believe them when they divest of all their trappings, especially certain cardinals of which I am thinking. No more platitudes, DO SOMETHING CONCRETE. Stop pillorying our beloved priests who do speak out!! Excommunicate James Martin also, he is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Many more also! I could say more, but I would just get ‘worked up’ all the more, and AFOM says it much better than me. May Jesus have mercy on us! Our Lady Queen of Peace, pray for us.”\n\nKris\n\nOhio\n\n“I just sent this text message to several friends: WOW! A Friend of Medjugorje wrote and released a letter to the bishops this morning. Someone in the comment section mentioned this podcast of February 2, 2019! I just finished listening. Remember St. Francis thought he was to rebuild the physical Church and then he realized that it was the internal Church that needed rescuing?! My thoughts after reading AFOM’s letter and listening to this podcast gives me the sense that it is not a coincidence that we have a Francis in the Church that is attempting to dismantle the teachings of the Catholic Church. Our Lady is here to help us to renew the Church and She is using AFOM, as a NEW Francis to counteract the destruction in order to help Her reach Her apostles; Apostles Of the End Times to renew the Church!!! What do you all think?”\n\nM.S.\n\nPaso Robles, California\n\n“Dear Friend of Medjugorje, you have given us an example of standing up for your convictions, and yet respectfully, not judgingly. May we all be able to stand up without fear. Lord, the next time I am faced with danger for Your sake, let me remember that You are faithful to reward Your people, no matter how much I may fear. Amen! Isn’t that the definition of courage! ‘God’s Word….is the…Light of common sense.’ (December 2, 2007) ‘And the one on whom seed was sown on good soil, this is the man who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.’ (Matthew 13:23) Medjugorje, Caritas of Alabama is holy ground, I believe!! ‘…this time is my time…’ (January 25, 1997) Thank you Heavenly Father for the many gifts of Graces through Your Son and His beautiful Mother.”\n\nJ.O.\n\nLillington, North Carolina\n\n“Of the original 12 bishops—the 12 apostles—which one did not suffer martyrdom? Of the original 12 bishops—the 12 apostles—which one stood at the foot of the Cross with Our Sorrowful Mother—Our Lady, knowing that at any minute he might be arrested and crucified with Our Lord? The answer to both questions is St. John. Ten apostles ran away in fear, one ran out and hanged himself. Stand with Our Lady at the foot of the Cross! AFTER Pentecost, the 12 bishops boldly proclaimed the Gospel, and later 11 suffered martyrdom. Bishops, do not wait until after the Warning to boldly proclaim Our Lady of Medjugorje.”\n\nJ.K.\n\nLas Vegas, NV\n\n“Thank you, thank you, thank you! You have called a Spade a Spade and rightfully so! I will continue to pray for the bishops that they will be moved to action by the Holy Spirit as you have been all these years! Biden & Pelosi MUST be excommunicated! So many in the pews see this, yet the Bishops refuse to use the power given to them by Almighty God! I pray they heed this message! YOU, and a few holy priests, are what has kept me faithful to the Catholic faith all these years! I have longed for the Church of my youth, and a world where morality and truth within the Church were what convicted sinners. When we lost that, we lost the ability to see our own sins. Bishops included! God has given his Mother to us and She has given You to us! God Bless you, your family and the Community of Caritas!”\n\nJulie\n\nFredericksburg, Texas\n\n“WILL THE BISHOPS EVEN HAVE THE BACKBONE TO READ THIS THROUGH??? Perhaps it could be read to them in the Confessional…Thank you AFOM for writing the words on many, many peoples’ minds. May they ring from our lips to the shepherd’s ears! May God have mercy on us all. Thank you, Caritas! All my love to Our Lady and to you!”\n\nLorraine\n\nMicco, Florida\n\n“My heart has been so very heavy for so long as I have watched the downfall of the Church and I feel like a prisoner for my strong warrior feelings for Our Lady. I thank you so much for standing up to the Bishops for their retreatment to safeness!! I keep thinking about how did the people, who were in the crowds shouting Crucify Him on Friday and waving their palm branches the Sunday before, feel as the veils of hatred were lifted and they finally realized what they had done. We are right back there!! May God protect us to do what is needed to save souls.”\n\nG.P.\n\nGallatin, Tennessee\n\n“Amen…..that says it all.”\n\nDianne—Pennsylvania\n\n“Amen! Perfectly explained. Spot on with the explanation of bishops and priests (our shepherds) regarding their tepidness toward Medjugorje and their political correctness; you have described the anger of all believers perfectly. I have always felt conflicted about having negative thoughts of someone holy, because we are taught it is a sin to say anything bad about a priest, pope or bishop. However, it is hard not to when they do not follow the Commandments themselves or make excuses (in my opinion) for those who would help them with power or image. I agree, Biden and Pelosi should be excommunicated until they repent for their vile words and actions. Thank you!”\n\nMaria\n\n“God bless you and the Blessed Mother of Jesus. I look forward to your readings always. I wish I could make a trip to Medjugorje, but it will only be in my prayers. Please keep praying for all of us. Thank you!”\n\nSusanne\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\n“Thank you for your leadership in addressing our Shepherds. I wholeheartedly agree. Most of them have missed the time of their visitation. As a governing body, they have utterly failed us and firmly placed us in the cattle cars of the anti-human, antichrist globalist agenda, with which Biden is absolutely tied. The Red Dragon of communism has spread its errors over the whole world and is preparing to enslave us physically in addition to the spiritual enslavement of confused Catechesis (ie, “socialist justice”) we have been enduring so long under the USCCB. Keep fighting. I unite my prayers and longings to yours.”\n\nL.T.\n\nDunlap, Tennessee\n\n“Time for the bishops to act and time for those in the pew to demand it. If God can hear our cries and see that we repent, He will have mercy on us.”\n\nAlan Eckl\n\nFlorence , Alabama\n\n“Bishops wake up before it’s too late!”\n\nDouglas Bourbina\n\nBloomington, Indiana\n\n“Thank you for all you do to promote Our Lady’s message. I share all I learn with others. God be with you and Mary hold you in Her Immaculate Heart.”\n\nJerinel Maynard\n\nDublin, Ohio\n\n“Catholic Diocese of Jackson, Mississippi, Bishop Joseph Kopacz, in reference to writing from a Friend of Medjugorje, January 19, 2021 A.D. ‘Blind to Your Wrong’—Thank you for this!”\n\nMaureen Murphy\n\nMadison, Mississippi\n\n“This is a powerful and courageous message. Well worth the time to read it fully. Our bishops have truly failed us. May God bless those brave priests who have visited Medjugorje and spread Our Lady’s messages.”\n\nJune Downey\n\nGrant Park, Illinois\n\n“I agree, bishops need to stand up against abortion, abominable unions, gender confusion, Socialism, Communism, etc. They need to listen to our Mother. Medjugorje is real and Our Lady’s messages are true and for our salvation.”\n\nDonald Wires\n\nLoveland, Ohio\n\n“Praying this message is heard and understood.”\n\nBridgette Barnhart\n\nSaint Louis, Missouri\n\n“Better late than never.”\n\nFrances Bigeni\n\nCentral Coast, NSW, Australia\n\n“You said it perfectly! Thank you for being the voice of the peasants in the pews: Our Lady Apostles of Love.”\n\nJihane Allen\n\nOkotoks, Alberta, Canada\n\n“Amen. Excellent writing and so true.”\n\nRobert McLeer\n\nLawrenceville, Georgia\n\n“Thank you for your spiritual nourishment with Our Lady’s message given through the visionaries of Medjugorje.”\n\nArt Zavala\n\nAnaheim, California\n\n“May Our Lord hear the cry of His people and covert our shepherds back to the day they fell in love to serve Christ and His people.”\n\nPatty Morales\n\nHumble, Texas\n\n“Bishops, we need you. Please stand up for injustice. Be led by Our Blessed Mother.”\n\nGeorgene Brook\n\nRedmond, OR\n\n“Praying for the bishops to see the injustice they are doing to all the people they are to be leading to their Eternal Home. I have often felt if it is alright for these, so called, Catholic leaders when they do not speak out against the blasphemy of Biden, Pelosi and others receiving the most Holy Sacrament. It should be justified then that anyone of other faiths can receive the Eucharist as well.”\n\nBarbara Wilson\n\nBoerne, Texas\n\n“I am tired of listening to sermons that have no meat every week but when are we going to hear what we need to hear regarding how to live our faith in this dark time. Why are we praying for the vaccine during the prayers after the Creed? Why is it ok for people to be maskless at the Latin Mass and receive on the tongue but not ok during the Ordus Novo Mass? Why has the Church never outwardly thanked President Trump but in my Church’s bulletin asking to pray for President Elect Biden? Really? I decided after USBBC congratulated Biden as president elect, I wrote my bishop and told him take me off the mailing list for Annual Bishop’s Appeal…I am done giving to the Church that is not serving the needs of the people. I had a conversion experience with Our Lady of Medjugorje and credit Her for leading me to Her Son Jesus. I was a cradle born Catholic, but I’ve learned more from a Friend of Medjugorje than my own parish priest. I am proud to say I am an apostle of Our Lady and will be a Child of Light.”\n\nFrancine Amy\n\nVera Beach, Florida\n\n“Our Lady, Queen of Peace, pray for us! God bless all of you at Caritas of Birmingham for your brave and faithful witness to our Blessed Mother and Her peace plan from Heaven. May this beautiful plea be heard and listened to by our bishops!”\n\nRegina McMahon\n\nCochranville, PA\n\n“Yes, please add my name. And yes, I will need strength and courage. Thank you for doing this for us in the pews.”\n\nElvira Lowe\n\nWoodbridge, VA\n\n“Very powerful and true.”\n\nCathy Tharp\n\nBardstown, Kentucky\n\n“WOW! I feel so blessed to have gone to Medjugorje with Caritas and been a part of something so profound! I will always remember how a Friend of Medjugorje stressed to the pilgrims to use every minute wisely. While reading this writing, my heart was on fire with conviction. I wanted to shout out to the whole world how real Medjugorje is (Mary’s Israel)!! Your words are so convicting and so full of Truth! Thank you for being so courageous to stand up and speak the TRUTH! WE, the peasants in the pew, needed to hear these words! Praying for our bishops to awaken and be courageous! Thank you again, a Friend of Medjugorje, for an OUTSTANDING ‘A+++’ writing! AMEN!”\n\nConnie Thomas\n\nHarwood, Texas\n\n“I stand with Terry!!! May I have the might to spread this message!!”\n\nDan Kremer\n\nYorkshire, Ohio\n\n“I pray for Archbishop Thomas Rodi and for my parish priest, Fr. David Shoemaker. I ask for the intercession of my childhood priest, Fr. Killian Mooney, who took a group of us to Caritas in the ‘80s.”\n\nMary Boyce\n\nEufaula, Alabama\n\n“Please, bishops, be true followers of the Lord, and true sons of Mary – the Warrior Queen and Gentle Mother. She has a plan to lead you and all people back to Her Son.”\n\nLisa Evans\n\nMarysville, WA\n\n“I agree with everything that you wrote. I feel blessed that you are standing up for what is the truth.”\n\nEarline Kraemer\n\nVacherie, Louisiana\n\n“You spoke the truth. Our bishops must stand for truth as Jesus did when He was here. Pray for our bishops to have courage and not to be afraid of what people will say or do and follow Mary’s words.”\n\nGene Velasquez\n\nChimayo, NM\n\n“Excellent writing.”\n\nLuci Holloway\n\nPort Townsend, WA\n\n“I totally agree with this writing by a Friend of Medjugorje, especially the part about standing up against the policies promoting abortion and I totally agree with this writing by a Friend of Medjugorje, especially the part about standing up against the policies promoting abortion and abominable marriage and socialism and condemning the policies of Joe Biden and others. We need our leaders to lead!”\n\nJames Snodgrass\n\nMacomb, Michigan\n\n“May God, through the intercession of Our Lady Queen of Peace, have mercy on us.”\n\nMaritza Romero\n\nModesto, California\n\n“For the state of my soul and those around me, I feel I need to see and discern all that Mother Mary has said over the last 40 years at Medjugorje. This is a grace that should not be ignored and I don’t intend to.”\n\nNichole Schmidt\n\nCelina, Ohio\n\n“Thank you for all that you do for the continued motivation to stay on our Salvation Course!”\n\nLaura Miller\n\nBreaux Bridge, Louisiana"
