        "text": "The apostolic constitution Anglicanorum Cœtibus is a response to petitions from groups of Anglicans to be received into communion with the Holy See in a corporate manner. This dissertation examines the origin of such petitions, the development of the principles guiding the response, and an analysis of the legislation. Chapter One traces the origins of corporate reunion from Newman to the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, in particular the Association for Promoting the Unity of Christendom and the Malines Conversations. Chapter Two discusses the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council with respect to ecumenism and Anglicanism. It examines the establishment of relations between Anglicans and the Holy See, the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC), and proposals for the corporate reunion of Anglicans in the Diocese of Amritsar, the United States, the Diocese of Matabeleland, and the United Kingdom. Chapter Three considers the overtures made by groups of Anglicans from 2005 to 2009. This includes the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), Church of England bishops, and the Traditional Anglican Communion. It details the announcement, reception, and implementation of Anglicanorum coetibus . Chapter Four examines proposals for the corporate reunion of Anglicans including the Church sui iuris, the personal prelature, and the personal apostolic administration. The notion of ordinariates is discussed with respect to the Latin ordinariates for Eastern faithful and military ordinariates. Chapter Five considers the implementation of the provision of Anglicanorum cœtibus, in particular the transmission of the Anglican patrimony through personal parishes, the liturgical provision, the formation of clergy, and ecumenical dialogue. The General Conclusion proposes two further developments: the extension of the objective criteria for eligibility for membership of a personal ordinariate, and the eventual erection of personal dioceses. Extensive appendices contain documentation pertaining to the development of the canonical model for the corporate reunion of Anglicans with the Catholic Church.\n\nThis thesis explores one aspect of the ongoing validity of orders debate within the Anglican Communion. It asks why the Communion – or elements within the Communion – continues to regard the recognition of its Holy Orders by other Churches, and especially by the Roman Catholic Church, as important. The juridical category of validity is distinct from the ecclesial category of recognition, but only valid Holy Orders may be recognised, and the official Anglican position was that the nature of Holy Orders after the Reformation was unchanged from the catholic standard and therefore should be recognised by other elements of the universal church. The understanding of ordination and the nature of Holy Orders differed somewhat between the Anglican Communion and the other major historical sections of the universal church – especially the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches – despite a degree of continuity and consistency. It may even have differed within the Communion. But the formularies of the Anglican Church (and now the broader Anglican Communion) have long suggested that its Holy Orders are equally valid as those of these other parts of the universal church, regardless of whether they are recognised externally. The internal normative validity of Holy Orders could not be readily impugned in a Church which maintains episcopal ordination. But the question of the external recognition of this validity – and the definition of validity in this context – turned upon the emphasis one placed upon the importance of the Communion’s claim to catholicity, as part of the “One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church”. The continued emphasis upon the universality of Holy Orders is the case study through which the wider catholicity of the Anglican Communion is explored. The Reformation was a challenge to the universality of Holy Orders, but no clearly dissimilar (or indeed identifiable) Anglican theology of Holy Orders developed out of that period. The loss of recognition by Rome following the Reformation did not necessarily mean that Holy Orders were no longer valid. But the quest for recognition of Holy Orders by other parts of the universal church remained important because of the legal continuity which was asserted, and which, to some degree at least, was preserved. In the late nineteenth century the validity of Anglican Holy Orders was definitively rejected by the Roman Catholic Church, largely on the grounds of the perceived loss of continuity of apostolic succession. This was despite protestations (especially by adherents of the Tractarian movement, but also by other elements in the wider Anglican Church) that Anglican Holy Orders were indeed valid catholic Holy Orders, and ought to be recognised as such. The Holy See could not, however, accord recognition to the Holy Orders of what it saw as a schismatic Church, or ecclesial community. But it was arguably in the twentieth century – a time of widespread reconsideration of the nature and meaning of the universal ministry of the church – that the real differences between Anglican and Roman Catholic theology of Holy Orders emerged. As at the time of the Reformation differences were based on distinct understanding of catholicity and ecclesial authority as much as differences over the nature of Holy Orders. In the twentieth century the validity question was influenced less by legalism and a sense of continuity than by œcumenism (what might be called an external justification). Ultimately this distinction makes it increasingly difficult to see the Anglican Church as catholic with respect to Holy Orders, at least as these were formerly understood. By this time the test of validity is not so much the nature of Holy Orders per se, but rather the more practical questions œcumenism raised, and especially in later years, the question of authority within Anglicanism. The validity of Anglican Holy Orders remains important to both the evangelical and the Anglo-Catholic within the Anglican Communion, but for different reasons, because of their differing understandings of the ministry of the universal church. With changing notions of Holy Orders, sacraments, and the nature of the universal church, the Holy Orders debate is still far from resolved. But perhaps the question has moved on from being a simple historical evaluation of technical continuity, intention and form, to a more difficult, but possibly ultimately more rewarding, question of the nature of the universal church. In particular, the acceptance of a common Anglican position on Holy Orders would be an important move towards a common understanding of the nature of the universal church, at a time when this is a key question facing Christianity."
