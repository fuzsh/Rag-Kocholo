        "text": "The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples is a dicastery founded in 1622 under the name “Propaganda Fide” (“Propagation of faith” in Latin) to take charge of all the “mission territories.” Today it oversees most of the dioceses in Africa, Asia and Oceania: that is, around 1,500 out of a total of 4,000 dioceses.\n\nThe C9 (the pope’s Council of Nine Cardinal Advisors) is examining the possibility of abandoning this distinction of mission territories and of merging the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples with the Pontifical Council for New Evangelization, created in 2010.\n\nMarie Malzac from La Croix addressed three questions to Father Antoine Sondag, Director of the National Service of the Universal Mission of the Church in the Conference of Bishops of France.\n\nLa Croix : Why is there a proposal to reform the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples?\n\nFather Antoine Sondag: The reform of this dicastery is a subject that has been an issue for a long time. It seems, in effect, that the ecclesiological implications of the Second Vatican Council were not realized with regard to the Propaganda Fide.\n\nWhen the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples was created, it was given the role of administering the territories “discovered” — that is, conquered — by the Spanish and Portuguese. The dicastery still ascribes, at least in its structures, to the colonialist mentality that was the norm until the 19th Century. Moreover, for a long time, the Church has delegated the organization of evangelization to the states concerned.\n\nIn what way is the congregation founded on a dated ecclesiology?\n\nPropaganda Fide – today’s Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples – remains founded on an ecclesiology that endorses an imperial vision of the Catholic world, with Rome and Christian Europe at the center, then territories “of Christianity,” and then peripheries to be evangelized.\n\nHowever, in the church, there are no peripheries apart from existential ones. This is something that Pope Francis often emphasizes. Every single church must be a mission.\n\nMoreover, we don’t judge a church according to the number of priests it “produces.” If this were the case, the churches of the Old World would, in their turn, become peripheral.\n\nIt remains, nonetheless, that some more recent dioceses of evangelization still need the financial support of other local churches. This should proceed as an “exchange of giving” and not as a “helper – helped” relationship. On the whole, the concept of “Christian territory” is not very Christian … as it refers to a patrimonial conception of faith, even though Christianity is, of course, part of the ancient history of many countries.\n\nHow is the term “mission territory” to be understood, as it will be used from now on to also refer to Europe?\n\nFrance — a mission country? The work of Fathers Henri Godin and Yvan Daniel, two priests of the Christian Youth Workers group was a bombshell in the Church of France when it was published in 1943. This work made a point about the “de-Christianization” in certain sections of French society, particularly in the world of trade and manual labor, at a time when people considered that it was Africa and Asia that needed to be “Christianized.” In the end, it became a springboard for a renewed missionary movement in France from 1945 onwards.\n\nFurthermore, one of the revolutions of Vatican II was the recognition of the value, weight and dignity of other religious traditions, and the promotion of respect for other cultures. The notion of “mission” was modified by this for several years, even though I would say that this period, from 1965 to the 1990s, has been surpassed. During the past two decades, there has been, for example, a slowing in the recruitment of missionaries of the “white Father” type.\n\nIn France, it has become evident to everyone, even to those who are removed from any religious practice, that the situation has been inverted with the arrival of many foreign priests. Today, of the 5,000 priests who are less than 75 years old, 2,000 come from elsewhere. So, for over 70 years, there has been the idea that one can be a missionary in France."
