        "text": "For an alphabetical list, see List of Catholic dioceses (alphabetical).\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nAs of June 21, 2024, the Catholic Church in its entirety comprises 3,172 ecclesiastical jurisdictions, including over 652 archdioceses and 2,249 dioceses, as well as apostolic vicariates, apostolic exarchates, apostolic administrations, apostolic prefectures, military ordinariates, personal ordinariates, personal prelatures, territorial prelatures, territorial abbacies and missions sui juris around the world.\n\nIn addition to these jurisdictions, there are 2,100 titular sees (bishoprics, archbishoprics and metropolitanates).\n\nThis is a structural list to show the relationships of each diocese to one another, grouped by ecclesiastical province, within each episcopal conference, within each continent or other geographical area.\n\nThis refers to Catholic dioceses in the world, of all Latin or Eastern churches, as of 5 October 2021 .[1]\n\nType Total Filled Vacant Holy See: St. Peter's Chair in Rome (papacy) 1 1 0 Ancient Patriarchal Sees of the East (Patriarchates) 6 6 0 Major Archiepiscopal Sees (Major Archeparchies) 4 4 0 Latin Patriarchal Sees 3 3 0 Titular Patriarchal Sees 4 3 1 Metropolitan Sees (Archdioceses & Eastern Archeparchies) 562 540 22 Other Archiepiscopal Sees (Latin Archdioceses & Eastern Archeparchies) 76 70 6 Episcopal Sees (Latin Dioceses & Eastern Eparchies) 2,248 2,033 215 Titular Metropolitan Sees including Archeparchies 92 14 78 Titular Archiepiscopal Sees including Archeparchies 91 6 85 Titular Episcopal Sees including Eparchies 1,913 1,059 854 Territorial Prelatures 49 36 4 Territorial Abbacies (Benedictine; often Exempt) 11 9 2 Military Ordinariates (all Exempt) 36 24 12 Personal Prelature (exempt) 1 1 0 Apostolic Vicariates (generally Exempt, mission) 84 75 9 Apostolic Prefectures (generally Exempt, mission) 39 14 25 Apostolic Administrations 8 7 1 Independent Missions (Missions sui iuris) 8 8 0\n\nAdditional types, exclusively for the Eastern Churches, Ordinariate Use and Extraordinary Form\n\nType Total Filled Vacant Metropolitan Sees (Eastern Archeparchies, Sui Juris) 5 5 0 Apostolic Exarchates (Eastern mission, Exempt) 13 11 2 Ordinariates for the Faithful of the Eastern Churches (Eastern, Exempt) 9 6 3 Personal Ordinariates (Western Anglican Patrimony, Anglican/Ordinariate Use, Exempt) 3 3 0 Patriarchal Exarchates (Eastern missions) 10 8 2 Archiepiscopal Exarchates (Eastern) 5 4 1 Territories Dependent on the Patriarch (Eastern) 5 4 1 Personal Apostolic Administration (unique case, Exempt) 1 1 0\n\nThese (arch)dioceses are exempt from belonging to any ecclesiastical province, hence only the Vatican can exert the authority and coordinating functions normally falling to the Metropolitan Archbishop. They are grouped here geographically. Nevertheless, most belong to an episcopal conference, in which case the more relevant mention is in its geographical region, as exempt dioceses as such do not have specific ties with each other.\n\nMilitary Ordinariates are in pastoral charge of the troops of a state, but may be vested in a Metropolitan Archbishop, typically in the national capital.\n\nAlso generally exempt are the apostolic prefectures and apostolic vicariates, which tend to be temporary missionary dioceses, expected to become part of an ecclesiastical province when promoted to regular (arch- or suffragan) bishopric.\n\nThe Personal Ordinariates for former Anglicans (who left the Anglican Communion for communion with the Holy See) are allowed to use the Ordinariate Use, which is counted as a variant usage of the Roman Rite (unlike the Eastern churches' five distinct rites).\n\nEastern Ordinariates are in pastoral charge of all Eastern Churches, of only those of Byzantine Rite or even just of the Armenian Rite, in one or more states of various Catholic churches without any proper diocese there, but are usually vested in a Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archbishop, often in the capital.\n\nDisregarded are many episcopal or archiepiscopal prelates in the Roman Curia, as their dicasteries don't constitute dioceses, although many posts there require by law or custom a bishop or an archbishop (usually titular), just as the Vatican's diplomatic posts in nearly every national capital.\n\nThe personal prelature (a unique status) of Opus Dei, with a cathedral see (Santa Maria della Pace ai Parioli) in Rome, ranking as bishopric.\n\nThe transcontinental Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus covering both Georgia (including breakaway self-declared states Abkhazia and South Ossetia) and Armenia, with cathedral see at Tbilisi (Georgia).\n\nThe Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross (for former Anglicans in Australia and Japan).\n\nin Italy:\n\nsome (arch)bishoprics under the papal Metropolitan see at Rome, including\n\nMilitary Ordinariate of Italy, cumulated with varying sees\n\nArchdiocese of Lucca\n\nTerritorial Abbey of Montecassino, whose cathedral see is a minor basilica\n\nTerritorial Abbacy of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, with cathedral see in Siena, seat of the abbot-general of the Olivetans (a Benedictine congregation)\n\nformerly the Territorial Abbey of San Paolo fuori le Mura (since 2005, just an abbey, territory incorporated into the diocese of Rome)\n\nTerritorial Abbacy of Subiaco, whose cathedral see and co-cathedral are minor basilicas\n\nItalo-Albanese Territorial Abbacy of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata, only non-Latin Church territorial abbey: Italo-Albanese Catholic rite\n\nItalo-Albanese Diocese of Piana degli Albanesi, with cathedral see at Palermo, on Sicily\n\nItalo-Albanese Diocese of Lungro, with cathedral see at Lungro, near Cosenza in Calabria\n\nin Austria:\n\nOrdinariate for Byzantine-rite Catholics in Austria, vested in the Metropolitan Archbishop of capital Vienna\n\nMilitary Ordinariate of Austria, not vested in any see\n\nin Belgium: Military Ordinariate of Belgium, vested in the primatial Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels\n\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina: Military Ordinariate of Bosnia and Herzegovina, not vested in any see\n\nin Bulgaria:\n\nDiocese of Nicopoli\n\nDiocese of Sofia and Plovdiv\n\nBulgarian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Sofia\n\nin Croatia:\n\nArchdiocese of Zadar\n\nMilitary Ordinariate of Croatia, not vested in any see\n\nin the Czech Republic:\n\nRuthenian Apostolic Exarchate of Czech Republic\n\nin and for all Denmark: Diocese of Copenhagen, including its overseas territories Greenland and the Faroe Islands\n\nin and for all Estonia: Apostolic Administration of Estonia (at Tallinn),\n\nFinland, including the autonomous region of Åland: Diocese of Helsinki\n\nin France:\n\nMilitary Ordinariate of France\n\nArchdiocese of Strasbourg\n\nDiocese of Metz\n\nOrdinariate for Eastern Catholics in France, vested in the Metropolitan Archbishop of capital Paris, for remaining Eastern Churches\n\nin Germany\n\nMilitary Ordinariate of Germany, cumulated with varying sees\n\nApostolic Exarchate in Germany and Scandinavia for the Ukrainians, with cathedral see in Munich (Bavaria);
