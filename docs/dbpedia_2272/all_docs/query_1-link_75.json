        "text": "Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula has received on Wednesday his pallium in a solemn liturgical ceremony that was led by the representative of Pope Francis in the Philippines and held at the Manila Cathedral, according to a post in the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) website.\n\nThe liturgical vestment called the pallium symbolizes the authority of the archbishop and his connection with papal authority.\n\nThe ceremony was led the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines, Archbishop Charles Brown during Mass in which he explained that the white cloth that is made of wool is given to the archbishop \"as a sign that he is to be an image of the Good Shepherd who seeks out lost sheep and brings them home rejoicing.\"\n\nBrown also said that Advincula, as a metropolitan archbishop is tasked \"to be vigilant over the entire province so that Catholic faith and church life are carefully preserved and he is called to keep the pope informed.\"\n\nHe was referring to the scope of jurisdiction of the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Manila, which includes the dioceses of Antipolo, Cubao, Imus, Caloocan, Malolos, Novaliches, Paranaque, Pasig, San Pablo, the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines, and the Apostolic Vicariates of Puerto Princesa and Taytay.\n\nThe Rite of Investiture of the Pallium is traditionally done at the Vatican during the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June 29.\n\nIt was in 2015 that Pope Francis decreed that the rite be conducted by his representatives, the nuncios.\n\nPope Francis appointed Cardinal Advincula as Archbishop of Manila succeeding Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, who was appointed as head of the Vaticanâ€™s Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples."
