        "text": "Re: Poems for God's glory Daniel Hoseiny 05:33 PM\n\nBallad for the Superhero and great Star or prayer of doxology to Jesus Christ.\n\nFor the glory of the Holy Trinity\n\nI want to sing a song to Jesus.\n\nI will praise Christ in church,\n\nI will praise him in the great assembly,\n\nI will glorify You on the forum, on the Internet.\n\nMary gave birth to You\n\nNear the city of Bethlehem of Judah,\n\nBut the Holy Spirit conceived You,\n\nAnd the Power of the Most High overshadowed Mary.\n\nYou are predestined to all creation,\n\nAfter all, Yourself are the Creator of the entire Universe;\n\nYou are the Word-Logos, who created everything from nothing,\n\nAccording to the Father's plan, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit.\n\nYou have become a man,\n\nYou were like us,\n\nBut You didn’t experience our lust,\n\nNor did You inherit Adam's sin.\n\nYou came to save the human race from eternal death,\n\nIntroducing us, the fallen, to eternal life.\n\nYou Yourself, - the Truth, the Way, the Life, - descended,\n\nReviving us with Yourself, through the communion of Your blood and body.\n\nYou shared our sorrows with us,\n\nTraveling through Canaan with Your disciples.\n\nAt night You felt the cold\n\nAnd the heat of sun with its scorching rays during the day.\n\nYou had compassion for people's sorrows,\n\nHealing the sick and disabled,\n\nYou raised the dead to life,\n\nGiving bread and fish to hungry,\n\nYou forgave all the sins of humble.\n\nYou proclaimed good news to the world with a word,\n\nRevealing nearness of God's Kingdom,\n\nIn figurative parables communicating Divine wisdom,\n\nHeartily calling on the people to repent.\n\nYou taught love's commandment to keep,\n\nTo show love in word and deed.\n\nTo do everything to our neighbor\n\nWhat we ourselves want from him to do for us,\n\nSo that we may store up treasures for ourselves in Heaven.\n\nYou revealed the meaning of the Old Testamental law,\n\nFulfilled the prophecies of prophets,\n\nThe Torah's entire Law prepared its doers for You,\n\nAnd all the prophets spoke hundreds years before about You.\n\nBut the hour of the Cross has come for You,\n\nOf bloody baptism to take place,\n\nTo give away Your life,\n\nSo that we may receive Your life.\n\nTo the villains You were delivered up to death.\n\nThey wanted to remove You.\n\nYou submitted meekly to the Lawyers that were lawless ones.\n\nAnd You were tempted by the horror of fierce suffering,\n\nIn agony while sweating blood.\n\nYou were obedient to Heavenly Father,\n\nSelflessly fulfilling His holy will.\n\nAnd rejecting the fear of imminent suffering.\n\nVile Judas volunteered to betray the Teacher\n\nTo the priestly court of two-faced God-fighters.\n\nCaiaphas began to interrogate\n\nTo ensnare You with deceit of the Christ-fighters.\n\nThe disciples left you at the fatal moment,\n\nThey were afraid to share Your cup;\n\nPeter denied you, saying: “I don’t know him,”\n\nAlthough he showed then secret repentance in tears.\n\nYou were faint-heartedly condemned by Pilate,\n\nHe cowardly sentenced You to death.\n\nThis is what the leaders of Your people wanted him to do:\n\nThose slandering priests and hypocrite Pharisees.\n\nYou meekly endured the blows of their black envy.\n\nAnd through experience you have known unbearable torments,\n\nWhen with the whip You were scourged innocently,\n\nWhen from the stick You received the wounds,\n\nWhen You stood with a pricky crown of thorns,\n\nWhen You were humiliated, dressed in scarlet robe.\n\nYou experienced the agony of torture, beatings, abuse.\n\nAs a self-proclaimed usurper You were slandered,\n\nLike a blasphemer delivered to the slaughter,\n\nWith meekness You endured public shame,\n\nEnduring all the bitterness of humiliation.\n\nBut You showed valor in trials,\n\nBy Your great courage You surpassed all men.\n\nPutting all the warriors to shame with Your brave-heartedness.\n\nAnd You looked death in the eyes,\n\nLike the Lion of Judah, a Brave Champion Leader.\n\nYou suffered a cruel punishment unjustly,\n\nYou accepted our curse voluntarily,\n\nAmong two thieves You hung on the cross,\n\nYou were counted among the villains involuntarily.\n\nEnduring heat and thirst and pain,\n\nSmirks, swearing, insults,\n\nThe wrath of God for our sins You have endured,\n\nShowing His Love for His creation.\n\nYou longed to save Adam and Eve,\n\nTo bring the lost sheep to the land of meek,\n\nTo find the human race for Heaven,\n\nAdopting prodigal son again to the Father.\n\nExperiencing our abandonment by God, You cried out:\n\n“Eli, Eli, lema sabachtani?”\n\n“Oh, God, my God, why have You forsaken me?”\n\n“It is accomplished,” You said,\n\nAnd You gave Your spirit to Yahweh.\n\nThe earth did not tolerate this lawlessness,\n\nShe suddenly began to shake,\n\nExposing the abomination of deicide.\n\nThe veil in the Temple was split apart,\n\nBy an invisible hand and the power of God into two parts.\n\nAnd the light disappeared in sky in broad daylight,\n\nThe sun darkened in the radiant azure.\n\nAnd stars and moon did not give shine,\n\nTheir Creator seeing as a slain Man.\n\nYou died on the tree of the cross on Paschal Day,\n\nThe chosen disciples and the women who served You were weeping.\n\nAnd mortal sorrow struck Mary, Your Mother, on this day,\n\nYour torment pierced her with an invisible weapon.\n\nAs Simeon once predicted it,\n\nAnd now the prophecies of the God-receiver came about.\n\nJoseph of Arimathea sacrificed his tomb for You,\n\nAnd he wrapped Your relics in a snow-white shroud.\n\nHe honored You with oily fragrance,\n\nHaving anointed Your body with expensive and fragrant myrrh.\n\nMary Magdalene bade You farewell with tearful sobs,\n\nShe wanted to smear your corpse with greater costly myrrh,\n\nAfter the Sabbath day, having honored it with lawful rest,\n\nShe dared to return to the grave with her friends on the third day.​\n\nThe devil saw Your death,\n\nThe demons rejoiced triumphantly.\n\nHe thought: “You are finished forever,\n\nYou are dust, I have destroyed You, clod of earth.\n\nWith crafty malice I killed You,\n\nYou will come to hell to be my prey forever.\n\nThere is no salvation for you, earth-born, from me;\n\nYou will never return to Garden of Eden,\n\nMy power and darkness are over you forever.\n\nAdam, his whole race I destroyed,\n\nI deceived Eve with evil cunningness,\n\nI prompted them to break the commandment of Creator,\n\nI stole Adam's honor and glory.\n\nNow the whole world has become mine forever,\n\nI forced Adam's race to sin,\n\nBy the fear of death I forced it into carnal slavery,\n\nBut none of you escaped the hour of death,\n\nI will rightfully torture you in hell forever!”\n\nBut You broke the backbone of his kingdom,\n\nHis gloating You imperiously put to shame,\n\nYou raised Your servants from the hell,\n\nYou moved their souls to Garden of the Eden,\n\nAnd God gave them to appear to many in Judea.\n\nYour enemy did not know that You are blameless,\n\nAbsolutely good and perfect in Your goodness\n\nWhich you chose from very beginning,\n\nBeing not involved in Adam's sin,\n\nYou are Man and God in a single God-human hypostasis.\n\nAnd now You, Lord, have revealed yourself alive,\n\nHaving been dead in Joseph's tomb yesterday,\n\nYou have revealed yourself again healthy, resurrected and revived,\n\nDespite the fact that You fell in sleep of death the day before the yesterday.\n\nThe Heavenly Father raised You up at night,\n\nAs a testimony that we will be resurrected with You.\n\nYou established the rite of baptism in Your churches,\n\nSo that we may partake of Your death and rise up with You forever.\n\nOn that first day of week, the angel announced to the disciples:\n\n“Why do you consider the Living Lord from heaven to be dead?\n\nDidn’t He speak about His uprising in advance?!\n\nTell the apostles, to Peter, quickly: Christ is risen from the dead!\n\nAnd on the mountain He will precede you in Galilee.”\n\nYou appeared to the apostles, eleven in number,\n\nWalking through the locked doors of the house.\n\nYou filled our hearts with unexpected joy,\n\nOur Teacher rose from grave unharmed!\n\nYou appeared to them for forty days,\n\nDispelling their fear with words of life.\n\nThe doubts left their minds,\n\nYou miraculously strengthened all their hearts.\n\nThomas the Apostle did not show faith in miracle,\n\nUntil he felt the wounds of Your hands and ribs.\n\nFeeling your body, he declared:\n\nMy Lord and God You are, now I believe forever!\n\nAnd forty days later You ascended to heaven,\n\nTo sit forever at the right hand of God the Father.\n\nBeing Yourself the Son of God and God, You are the Son of Father,\n\nEternal Lord You are, Wisdom of Yahweh, Lord of Hosts.\n\nYou are the King of kings, the most holy priest of God,\n\nLike the once mysterious Melchizedek of Salem.\n\nYou are meek Lamb of God and warlike Lion,\n\nYou are the Bridegroom of the Church, the Sun of New Jerusalem.\n\nYou sent the Holy Spirit from God to the apostles,\n\nSo they could speak in other tongues.\n\nSo that apostles could proclaim the Kingdom of Trinity to world,\n\nSo that apostles could be fishers of men for God eternal.\n\nFor all this I thank the Father,\n\nAnd with this verse I glorify the Son of God,\n\nI give honor to the Holy Ghost\n\nAnd I magnify God the Trinity forever.\n\nTrust my words, o friend of mine,\n\nDo not doubt the Holy Gospel.\n\nOn Day of Judgment everyone will be rewarded for their deeds,\n\nSo hurry up to justify yourself before the God for free,\n\nby virtue of the blood of Jesus.​\n\n1 223 Read More"
