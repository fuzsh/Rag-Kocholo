No dejéis el cumplimiento de vuestros deberes religiosos, pues sin él no seréis reconocidos como verdaderas cristianos en el día del juicio.\n\nMujeres: no seáis con vuestra inmodestia responsables del los pecados de los hombres.\n\nPadres de familia: cuddad de la cristiana educación y vigilancia de vuestros hijos. Los que tenéis riquezas no olvidéis los deberes de caridad que ellas imponen.\n\nPatronos y empresarios: no os hagáis responsables de injusticias no dando salarios suficientes a vuestros obreres o poniendo precios excesivos a vuestras mercancías.\n\nObreros: no os despojéis de vuestra gran dignidad de hijos de Dios, ante el cual gozáis de plena igualdad con los que ante los hombres temporalmente os aventajan, seducidos por la fantástica igualdad que predica el comunismo, convertida, si triunfa. en despótica tiranía que atropella la dignidad de la persona humana.\n\nEstos son los últimos consejos de quien ha sido padre de vuestras almas y que ahora os pide una oración por la suya.\n\nEn Los Negrales, a 3 de julio de 1961.
