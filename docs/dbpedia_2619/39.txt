LeAnn Rimes' song "On The Side Of Angels" is a heartfelt ballad that delves into the themes of love, trust, and divine guidance. The lyrics convey a sense of certainty and purity in a romantic relationship, suggesting that true love is supported by a higher power. The phrase "We're on the side of angels" implies that their love is blessed and protected, giving them the courage to trust in it despite past disappointments and fears.

The song acknowledges the difficulties and uncertainties that come with love. Lines like "Is it so hard to trust it 'Cause we've been wrong before" and "After all the might-have-beens, The close and distant calls" reflect the common human experience of heartbreak and the hesitation to trust again. However, the song encourages embracing love and taking the leap of faith, as it reassures that they are guided by a gentle, divine hand.

The recurring theme of divine intervention is further emphasized with the lines "Heaven only knows Why this took so long" and "But only Heaven knows A love is right or wrong." This suggests that the timing and success of their love are beyond their control and are instead orchestrated by a higher power. The song ultimately delivers a message of hope and faith, urging listeners to believe in the purity of their love and to trust that they are on the right path, guided by angels.
