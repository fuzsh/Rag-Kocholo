In every little boy/girl’s life, goals are set and dreams are made, but not everyone’s dream comes true. In the world of LeAnn Rimes, her dream of becoming a country music superstar has become reality. Born on August 28, 1982, in Jackson, Mississippi, LeAnn Rimes (like Brenda Lee and Tanya Tucker), has become a major country music superstar. LeAnn Rimes is an only child who began singing before she was two.\n\nLeAnn Rimes won her first talent contest at the age of five and almost won the lead in Broadway’s Annie 2 at age six. Musically, she has been influenced by Patsy Cline, Reba McEntire, Barbara Streisand, and her parents. At age six, she moved to Texas to pursue her dream of country superstar. At age eight, she was a two-week champion on TV’s star search. At age eleven, she recorded her first album, After All, which was produced by Wilbur. After the success of her album, LeAnn released another album titled Unchained Melody: The Early Years. The songs on this album were recorded when LeAnn was only twelve. Critics commented that at fourteen, LeAnn seemed wise beyond her years. She didn’t look or act like fourteen but that could be because of the fact that she has been in the business since she was six or seven years old.\n\nIn May 1996, her recording of Blue hit the Billboard charts. In 1996 she won awards such as the Academy of Country Music Single of the Year, the Academy of Country Music Song of the Year, Academy of Country Music Top New Female Vocalist, Grammy Best Female Country Vocal Performance, and Grammy Best New Artist. In 1997 she won awards at the American Music Awards as the Favorite New Artist, CMA Horizon Award, TNN/ Music Cry News Stars of Tomorrow – Female. In June, 1998, she was again nominated as Best Female Artist by the TNN Music City News Country Awards.\n\nRimes has now won many awards for her music, including two Grammys, three ACM’s a CMA, 12 Billboard Music Awards, and one American Music award. According to Wikipedia, she has released ten studio albums, three compilation albums, and two greatest hits albums through her record label.\n\nIn addition to her semi-autobiographical novel, Holiday in Your Heart (1997), Rimes has also written three other books, Why I Cannot Change (2009), and two children’s books: Jag in 2003 and Jag’s New Friend in 2004.\n\nRimes married Dean Sheremet in 2002 and divorced him in 2010. In 2011, she married Eddie Cibrian. She has raised money using a public service announcement to make people aware of psoriasis (an autoimmune disease with which she has struggled), singing Just Stand Up to benefit cancer research, and joined a gay men’s chorus in Los Angeles, performing The Rose in remembrance of gay teenagers who have committed suicide., and most recently the Friend Movement, an anti-bullying organiztion.\n\nRimes has appeared in numerous television episodes and videos. A complete list of her music is available on her website.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nTimeline\n\n1982 – August 28, LeAnn was born in Jackson, Mississippi\n\n1987 – won her first talent contest\n\n1988 – moved to Texas\n\n1990 – June 22, First TV performance at Disney World\n\n1991 – Appeared on Star Search\n\n1993 – recorded her first album All That\n\n1996 – recorded the album Blue\n\n1996 – Award: Academy of Country Music Single of the Year\n\n1996 – Award: Academy of Country Music Song of the Year\n\n1996 – Award: Academy of Country Music Top New Female Vocalist\n\n1996 – Award: Grammy Best Female Country Vocal Performance\n\n1996 – Award: Grammy Best New Artist\n\n1996 – May, Blue hits Billboards to top\n\n1996 – September, appears on the David Letterman Show and Grand Old Opry\n\n1997 – Award: American Music Awards –wins Favorite New Artist\n\n1997 – Award: CMA Horizon Award\n\n1997 – Award: TNN/ Music Cry News Stars of Tomorrow- Female\n\n1997 – Her semi-autobiographical book Holiday in Your Heart published, LeAnn co-writes book with Tom Carter.\n\n1997 – LeAnn’s acting debut, when she stars in the ABC-TV movie Holiday in Your Heart in December.\n\n1997 – LeAnn has a number one pop single with “How Do I Live,” written by Diane Warren.\n\n1999 – records Sittin’ On Top of the World\n\n2001-Mar 2001 – A judge refused to let Leann Rimes out of a recording contract entered when she was 12 years old.

Born in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 28 in 1982, Margaret LeAnn moved with her parents to Dallas, Texas, to pursue her dream of becoming a country superstar. Her career shot to the top when her album Blue went to Billboard’s Top 10, making LeAnn Rimes the youngest country singer ever to debut that high. At the time, she was the only country singer ever to win a Grammy for Best New Artist and have a hit on Billboard’s Top 10. Many girls dream of becoming Cinderella, but LeAnn’s dream was to be a country superstar.”(LeAnn Rimes quoted in Holiday in your Heart)\n\nIn the book a teenaged singing sensation named Anna Lee realizes her dream of performing a holiday concert on the stage. Yet her happiness is somewhat lessened by thoughts of her grandmother at this special time of year, who is stricken with an illness and unable to see her beloved granddaughter. It takes lessons from an older country singer, a musical legend now past her prime, who tells the young singer that she can carry a holiday in her heart all year round if she knows which things matter the most. LeAnn Rimes’s many fans will find Holiday in Your Heart a heart breaker by this fine young country female singer.\n\nRelated Websites\n\nLeAnn Rimes website\n\nLeAnn Rimes’ Twitter Account\n\nPeople Magazine’s page on LeAnn Rimes\n\nBibliography\n\n“LeAnn’s Facts.” Artist Fact Sheet n. pag.
