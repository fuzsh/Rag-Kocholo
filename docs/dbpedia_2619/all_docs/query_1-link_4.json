Felt like they should be included since they never will be if we end up doing an album series from her.\n\nPost by Cody Wants Out... on\n\n{Can I fit, like, ten of these in my #1 spot?}That was fast! I'm definitely in, but this'll be a tough one.\n\nPost by Az Paynter on\n\nMy apologies in advance for gassing Pop!LeAnn over Country!LeAnn but holy.f**k.yes I am here for this.\n\nLove seeing 'Tic Toc' and 'You Are' on the list since they were never full ride singles (but they have some phenomenal remixes omg)\n\nPost by Kanenrá:ke on\n\nMy apologies in advance for gassing Pop!LeAnn over Country!LeAnn but holy.f**k.yes I am here for this.\n\nLove seeing 'Tic Toc' and 'You Are' on the list since they were never full ride singles (but they have some phenomenal remixes omg)\n\nShe's always had some great remixes out there and as always everybody's free to rank a remixed version if need be.\n\nIf I don't get lazy I'd like to highlight some remixes or maybe instead of album tracks people can send a list of their 5 favorite remixes?\n\nPost by Az Paynter on\n\nIf I don't get lazy I'd like to highlight some remixes or maybe instead of album tracks people can send a list of their 5 favorite remixes?\n\nIDK if I could stop at 5 lmao but Widelife's 'Tic Toc' and Lenny Bertoldo's 'You Are' are essentials for me.\n\nPost by toomuchboy on\n\nSo many great songs here. I've been putting together the list the past two days.\n\nIt's too bad \"We're Running Out of Time\" from that Desperate Housewives soundtrack wasn't put out as a single of some kind, like \"God Bless the American Housewife\" was for SHeDAISY, since I love that song.\n\nPost by bboat11 on\n\n@walker9 said:\n\nSo is this going to happen?\n\nOop, this one slipped my mind. Yeah Jordan, what's the status?\n\nWell, he did say that this one would officially open after the Terri Clark rankdown finishes... And he has only revealed the bottom 5 of the Terri Clark rankdown... Soooo, feel free to start working on this one, but tbh it’s probably not going to start this year 😂\n\nPost by Kanenrá:ke on\n\nKanenrá:ke since Terri Clark has been revived, are you going to start pushing this again soon too?\n\nlol yes I was going to start tagging people when I get to the top 10 of Terri.\n\nPost by Az Paynter on\n\nMy apologies in advance for gassing Pop!LeAnn over Country!LeAnn but holy.f**k.yes I am here for this.\n\nLove seeing 'Tic Toc' and 'You Are' on the list since they were never full ride singles (but they have some phenomenal remixes omg)\n\nShe's always had some great remixes out there and as always everybody's free to rank a remixed version if need be.\n\nIf I don't get lazy I'd like to highlight some remixes or maybe instead of album tracks people can send a list of their 5 favorite remixes?\n\nI hope you're still gonna do this, 'cause seeing this thread revived got me thinking about it again lol.\n\nPost by bboat11 on\n\nShe's always had some great remixes out there and as always everybody's free to rank a remixed version if need be.\n\nIf I don't get lazy I'd like to highlight some remixes or maybe instead of album tracks people can send a list of their 5 favorite remixes?\n\nI hope you're still gonna do this, 'cause seeing this thread revived got me thinking about it again lol.\n\nTrust me, he'll do it. He ain't quick, but he's dependable!\n\nPost by Kanenrá:ke on\n\nI meant about the top remixes thing lol. I'd love to do a mini-ranking of her remixes.\n\nYou could always host a remix rankdown after the rankdown is done, I've been thinking they could be their own thing rather than mixed into the main one.\n\nGoing to be finishing up my other RD soon and start getting this one back up and running!"
