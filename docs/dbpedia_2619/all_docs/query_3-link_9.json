        "text": "LeAnn Rimes (born August 28, 1982, Jackson, Mississippi, U.S.) is an American country music singer who topped the charts at age 13 with her rendition of “Blue.” She drew attention and admiration for her vocal similarity to country legend Patsy Cline.\n\nRimes began singing at age two and won her first competition when she was five. Like Cline, Rimes first gained national exposure on a television talent show, appearing as champion for two weeks on Star Search when she was eight. She recorded her first full-length album three years later for a local independent label and was soon signed to Curb Records. It was with Curb that her career took off, and her debut album, Blue (1996), brought the teenager a number one hit and a pair of Grammy Awards. The title song was written by record promoter Bill Mack in the 1950s, and, when Rimes’s recording was released, it was reported that he had intended the song for Cline. Her label was quick to capitalize on this success, releasing two albums of cover versions (previously recorded material)—Unchained Melody: The Early Years and You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs—in 1997 before Sittin’ on Top of the World reached the market the following year.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
