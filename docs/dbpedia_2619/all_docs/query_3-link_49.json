        "text": "Reba McEntire has an impressive roster of smash hits under her cowboy belt, but The Voice Coach's song \"When You Love Someone Like That\" takes breakup ballads to a new level. The crowd at the 2007 Country Music Awards was in for a treat when LeAnn Rimes took the stage to perform alongside McEntire.\n\n\"I grew up studying every move this woman made,\" Rimes told the CMT audience. \"She is a strong, fearless, class act who is more powerful than ever 30 years into her career. A lifelong dream of mine was fulfilled recently for an album of duets. The woman I’m speaking of is Reba.”\n\nThe performance was nothing short of incredible, with Rimes and McEntire's stripped-down vocals making for an angelic set. While Rimes hit each note with expert precision, McEntire harmonized along to the mesmerizing tune, an outstanding collaboration between two powerhouse country artists. Watch the breathtaking performance, here.\n\n\"When You Love Someone Like That\" is a single from McEntire's twenty-sixth studio album Reba: Duets, which features several must-hear collaborations with classic vocalists like Rimes, Rascal Flatts, Carole King, Kenny Chesney, and Kelly Clarkson to name a few. The two Voice Coaches teamed up to cover Clarkson's smash single \"Because of You\" for the album, and yes, it's spectacular.\n\nToday, McEntire is just as booked and busy as she was in 2007. She's currently gearing up to Coach Season 24 of The Voice alongside Gwen Stefani, Niall Horan, and John Legend, and all eyes are on the country queen as she takes her first seat in the red chair. The 68-year-old may be the rookie of the crew, but make no mistake: Season 24 isn't her first rodeo with The Voice; she was a Battle Advisor to Team Blake in Season 1 and the Mega Mentor in Season 23.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to being here with you all,\" McEntire told Carson Daly during the Live Semi-Final Top 8 Performances after she was announced as a Season 24 Coach. \"You've treated me all so nicely. and I appreciate the hospitality so much that you've shown me ... to be able to come in and form my own team, I'm so looking forward to it.\""
