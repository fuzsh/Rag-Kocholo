All day long at work, I had \"no language in our lungs\" running through my head. No idea why, but, being that I act as a binary mailman at work, maybe it was some obscure question about MIME attachments and foriegn codepages that had languages in my head. Anyways. So, I get home, and start looking for Black Sea. Nope, nowhere to be found in the hosue, not on any of the three floors, nor in the car, nor in the kite bag (been working on a stunt kite routine to various XTC songs lately). Not here, not there, nope, not even hiding over there. So, I settled for Go2, and in the process remembered what a fine album it is. I first heard Drums and Wires as a wee tyke, but, quickly liked Go2 better at that time and I haven't listened to it in ages. mmmmmmmmmm.... >From: \"DADDY'S GIRL\" <ACOEA@jazz.ucc.uno.edu> >Subject: Now now, let's not get too negative...... > >Hanson.

John Squire (Stone Roses) hatched this band - the album's called _Do it Yourself_ on Geffen (where else?), and he plays some of the best guitar i've heard in AGES, and all in a very poppy and british (but not particularly britpop, to my surprise - it's much more original musically) way - it reminds me a lot of Sloan's new cd, _One Chord To Another_, except that the Seahorses are a much better band. that said, the lyrics are a little silly, and one song was co-written by that complete idiot Liam Gallagher, but who cares, i think it's great. \"The Boy in The Picture\" is like a long-lost Kinks song, and a friend of mine compared parts of the album to Matthew Sweet and Michael Penn. Also fans of the Posies absolutely outstanding record _Amazing Disgrace_ will like this album - \"Happiness is Eggshaped\" sounds like it could have come off of the happier Posies album that they're probably going to make now that they've flirted with depression. anyway, Squire found this random guy named Chris Helme busking and made him join the band, and he has a great almost Scottish sounding accent except in one song where he sounds like Mike Myers in Ming Tea. [smiling politely, Brian Matthews wrote:] > Tschalkgerz! cut that out - you're giving me a headache. :) > me. I keep reading about some of you panning \"Peter Pumpkinhead\" or > \"Books Are Burning\" (pointless guitar solo? When did ANY guitar solo > make a point? It's music, for crying out loud - it both means something > AND nothing) or \"Garden Of Earthly Delights\" or \"My Weapon\" or \"Human the reason i think \"Books Are Burning\"'s guitar solos are pointless is because they're not the slightest bit necessary to the song, and they don't add anything. they're supposed to be that way, of course, because the song is a nod to the grand old tradition of classic rock guitar masturbation, which i also find boring as hell. all the other songs you cited are various degrees of excellence musically, but lyrically slightly flawed. i don't think that's really the same thing as saying that they suck. i like about 95 percent of all XTC songs, and for me that's really saying something - the only band i have a higher percentage with would probably be the Beatles (taking into account the fact that the latter wrote more songs [right?]). there are definitely other people on this list, however, who feel the way that you do after having heard almost everything by Our Lads (tm Harrison Sherwood?), so don't worry - you're not alone. > I don't know, Brookes... what WERE you thinking when you bought a Kula > Shakur CD? obviously nothing too intelligent. i did also note that it was produced by John Leckie, but IMO he's definitely produced some rubbish before - see the second Posies album which i've forgotten the name of but which everyone thinks is *so* great but which i find intensely irritating and whiny. [Martin Monkman trilled birdlike, re: who plays what:] > I wonder if Andy is insulted by the fact the he only let himself play > tambourine and shaker on \"Rook\". And does anybody hear much bass guitar on > \"1000 Umbrellas\"? Just wondering. alright, i admit that i was extrapolating a little (much!). but it is true that the only \"real\" instrument on \"Rook\" is the piano, and Andy has said that he was so bad at playing the chords for \"Rook\" that when he was writing it, he had to make a hand out of cardboard and use it to play the notes properly. so of course he would let Gregsy play the key-boreds. - brookes ----------------------rmckenzi@dti.net------------------------------- R.

Hell no! Even if you're going on sheer catchiness, the Third Eye Blind song beats it out easily. I can barely stand to listen to MMMBop.

Beyond the obvious difficulty of pulling something like this off on purpose, a few tries will show you that other movies work even better.

I had been preparing to say something like this myself. The Hansons (and I will confess, I was uncertain as to whether they were brothers or sisters on first sight) suffer from the standard panoply of pre-adolescent teen band problems: voice-yet-to-change vocal delivery, awful lyrics and a regrettable tendency for teenage girls to think they're the best thing since the Beatles. When I hear \"MmmmBop\" I experience a momentary urge to cringe at the singing, but underneath that the truth is this: the song is well constructed, bouncy bubble-gum pop. And I like well constructed, bouncy bubble-gum pop. There is some small hope that in five years these boys may be able to write (and sing) lyrics as good as the music, and then they'll be a band to notice.

But so many intriguing tid-bits, it's well worth the wait!! * \"Shonen Knife contacting Andy to produce them.\" I wonder when that was and if the idea was to do an entire album or just a song remix. The reason I ask is because Shonen Knife released a 7 song EP in Japan in July entitled \"It's A New Find.\" On it, there are two John X remixes and (wait for it) a Sterolab remix of Hot Chocolate! Actually when I think of what Andy and Shonen Knife would sound like, it screams \"Stereolab\" for some reason. I assume with the label decisions being finalized, this project is either dropped or very back burner? Off topic, but speaking about J-pop collaborations, Andy Sturmer and Paul Bevoir both contribute to a mini disc by Ami (1/2 of the mega big in Japan \"Puffy\"), called \"Honey.\" Even further off topic, but sad news: Imperial Drag is history.... * Dave's Abbey Road studio 2 week Did they actually do the deed and re-record Sgt Pepper???

I've played a solo acoustic act for 11-12 years.These days I've got a 3-piece original band. Back to the solo acoustic thing, I have performed such pearl ditties as \"Dear God\", \"Earn enough for us\", \"The Mayor of Simpleton\" (nothin simple about playing and singing that one), \"King for a day\", and \"Dying\" (I like that one alot). \"Senses working Overtime\", \"Big Day\", I guess I did alot of XTC now that I reflect on it. Just thought you should no. On the subject of different producers, REM can be also considered a band that works with different ones. This makes them unique, and you can hear the difference in the sounds, also how the music was sonically packaged. With Don Gehman (John Cougar Mellencamp) REM got JCM's sound, particularly the drum sounds. They used Gehman's studio for recording the album \"Life's Rich Pageant\". For the album \"Fables of the Reconstruction of the Fables of the Reconstruction of the.............\" Sorry. Joe Boyd of the band Fairport Convention produced that. I like the sound, more keyboard oriented than anything else up to that time. On \"Document\" they used Scott Litt (produced \"Walking on Sunshine\"-Katrina and the Waves) and they found the hit single formula. Producers are important, for guidance as well as moral support. It's kinda nice to know you have a friend in the control booth. I imagine it's gotta reek bad when you feel that you are working at cross-purposes with a producer. Where am I going with all this? Diversity of producers=Diversity in a band's sound. I'm a fan of that. Cheerio Chalkheads!

If you haven't been there yet, please drop by if you get a chance. The purpose of the site is to connect XTC fans with other artists they might like, based on the opinions of other XTC fans. www.macbeth.com/funkpoparoll A couple of digest back, Natalie wrote: >I'd much rather have a site where people talk about their >favorite albums regardless of what they sound like While this is a valid point, I felt that for my site (and its intended purpose), some focus was needed. XTC fans tend to have pretty eclectic tastes, and to include *everything* that *every* XTC fan likes would result in a list of just about *every* artist that exists, rendering the whole thing useless. While I have not chosen to limit the scope of the site to bands that \"sound like\" XTC, I *have* limited it to artists with similar musical values. Deciding what is appropriate and what isn't will be tough, a lot of the time. Led Zeppelin, for instance (love them though I may) didn't make it. Brian Stevens and The Cavedogs, on the other hand, did. Curiously, on the same day that my initial announcement hit the list, a similar announcement appeared on the Jellyfish list. I checked out site site: http://icentral.com/gumby/jellyfish/otherbands.html Meaning no disrespect to Jellyfish fans or the author of the site (it's quite well done), it's interesting to see that it judges artists based on the degree to which they sound like Jellyfish. This isn't my intention at all. I am simply looking for a low common denominator among our various tastes. So there you have it. I would desperately like some other viewpoints on the site, so if anyone wants to submit something, please drop by, get a general idea as to what I'm looking for, and let me know.

I'm asking you to all rack your brains for this one......I heard a song not that long ago on a music system I have called Digital Cable Radio. I never learned the title of the song or the artist, but the song haunts me. I managed to tape enough of it to listen to, but the sound isn't very good. At least ONE of you MUST know the artist/title, this is driving me insane. Here are some of the lyrics- Baby I see this world has made you sad some people can be bad, the things they do, the things they say. But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears, I'll chase away those restless fears that turn your blue skies into gray. Why worry? There should be laughter after pain. There should be sunshine after rain. These things have always been the same. So why worry now? You all have such eclectic music tastest, somebody's got to know who this is. It's such a beautiful song. And now onto the XTC on this XTC list. Alright, my new list of trading stuff should be up in a mo. There's more acoustic shows, a few more demos. I would have more, but one person I thought I was trading with took my stuff but gave me nothing in return. I've lost this man's email address, so hello Mr. Man. If I misunderstood something in our trading agreement, you let me know. But if you're one of the cabal of schemers and scammers, then you know where you can go. Everyone's talking about Andy's demos. What about the stuff Dave and Colin work on? Dave's version of Third Stone From the Sun is incredible. I had to play my tape on high speed dubbing to understand what he was saying. And I hope Where Did the Ordinary People Go? makes it onto tape. Well, at the rate they're going, I'm not sure Dave OR Colin's ever going to go bald. (Anyone who notices-er-nitpicks, will see that Dave's always had a high hairline.) Poor Andy got the shaft, he started losing it before he hit 30. But why am I babbling about boring topics? (Because I'm AMANDA, that's why!) And now I must be going, I will close on this note- I'm going to shoot my beloved Philip if he refers to \"Oranges & Lemons\" as \"Lemons & Limes\" one more time!!!!!! Ciao, Amanda MONDO CANE!

None of the producers listed as possibilities intrigues me that much. Why not just an engineer? All three band members are adequate producers themselves, why shrink profits by paying for an unneeded expense. Could it be the band simply needs an arbitrator when differences of opinion arise? If XTC signs a deal with PONY CANYON Records in Japan then either expect a BONUS track to be included in the Japanese release or perhaps an earlier release date. This is due to the fact that Japanese fans will often buy the American import as it is cheaper to acquire (or so I've been told). Todd Rundgren just ended a three CD deal with PONY CANYON and the first two were released at least four months before the American version (the last is still unreleased stateside). Speaking of TR, I hear Terry Hall is releasing a cover version of I Saw The Light.

If you like historical sea-fiction, arr, mateys, it doesn't get any better than this: you got your swashbuckling naval adventures, you got your Grand Historickal Gestures, you got writing that doesn't make you want to take a shower, you got your authentic-sounding (early 19th-Cent.) dialogue, and above all your punctilious research into period detail. Not since Horatio Hornblower, etc., etc. It's the \"painstaking research\" part of the equation that engenders this post. I'm on a second read of _Desolation Island_--one of the best of the bunch--and I keep noticing references to midshipmen \"skylarking\" in the rigging of the _Leopard_ (Capt. Aubrey's fourth-rate, 55-gun ship). At first I simply thought it meant general goofing off, in the way that teenagers do, but as the narrative developed I began to notice that the term was being used in a much more specific way. I went to the dictionary to look up the origin of the word, and it turns out there _was_ more than met the eye: The word \"skylark\" used as an intransitive verb dates to 1809 (the book is set in 1810! See what I mean about \"authentic\"?), and means \"to run up and down the rigging of a ship in sport.\" As O'Brian describes it, it's essentially playing an appallingly dangerous form of tag, using ropes and pulleys and spars as a playing field 150 feet above the deck of a pitching, yawing and rolling sailing ship. Not the kind of thing you'll catch _me_ doing, at any rate. Two observations: 1) It's time to revise the cover art on the XTC album. That graceful-lined bird in Adam's eye and repeated on the lyric sheet--presumably a skylark--has got to go; the word's related to the bird only peripherally 2) I guess this intelligence adds to the already suspiciously large body of evidence that Andy Partridge has a _serious_ sea fixation. Paying attention, Mitch? Can you work this into the \"XTSea Medley\" somehow? FWIW, the word \"lark,\" meaning \"something done solely for fun or adventure,\" is a back-formation from \"skylark.\" \"Skylark\" as applied to the _bird_ dates from 1686. The skylark (Alauda arvensis) is, interestingly, \"noted for its song, especially in vertical flight.\" No word as to whether that vertical flight is headed straight up or down.

To go outside of the XTC canon, it reminds me of \"Luck Be a Lady Tonight\", the \"my ex-wife\" bit aside. \"Your Dictionary\" sounds closer to \"Dear Madam Barnum\" in my dictionary, under the attitude and directly addressing the now-hated woman. \"Dame Fortune\" is just much more hopeful in the Ira Gershwin way. I'd like it released on something, even if only a B-side, cos I find it too breezy to ignore. The rustic production on the demo is enjoyed here and shouldn't be ruined with gloss. XTsCheme is a blast. Windows NT is finally useful for something! Anyone see \"Brassed Off\", with Pete Postlethwaite, Ewen McGregor & Tara Fitzgerald? There's a scene where Andy (McGregor) and Gloria (Fitzgerald) meet as adults, each recognizing the other and trying to hide some embarrassment about a bit of skylarking they did as teens. To this end, Gloria pretends to have forgotten his name, and first calls him...Barry Andrews! Three times, no less. A mere coincidence, or more? (PS Very good movie, too.) JHB: What's the whole Wonderland/Wonderland conspiracy? Big Country, around the time of Mummer, released an EP called Wonderland with the eponymous song as a single. I heard that \"Wonderland\" on the radio and saw on MTV a few times, and it pops up on flashback alternative once in a while. Compared to XTC's \"Wonderland\", Big Country's was a commercial smash in the US (going on my own experience, that is). Ergo, as with Mummer and Murmur, why has XTC been so close the chimera of success :-)? Hanson backlash backlash dept: It's never gonna be XTC, in ten years there won't be a cadre of writers championing them. That said, and knowing how little I've heard it cos I'm not a top-40 listener, it reminds me of Michael Jackson, before he lost any artistic bearing and spent 5 years* and $$ millions & millions to make overblown CDs lasting longer than some movies. (* That is \"in the studio\", not, say, \"in dispute with a creatively bankrupt label\".) Annnnd, a local music writer reviewed \"The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy\", by The Minus 5, who include REM's Peter Buck. They are described as \"pearl-diving into rock's history\" to make a \"winning pop pastiche\". Before you say, Hey! That sounds familiar, he ends \"as XTC did with psychedlic alter egos Dukes of Stratosphear\".

Gesundheit! > ...I keep reading about some of you panning \"Peter Pumpkinhead\"... Well, I'm one who recently panned PP - I still think is too blatant of an analogy. Some have mentioned that the song describes a JFK/Camelot/martyr situation, but to me it's a major critique of any Large Established Religion. Has anybody here read Dostoyevsky's 'The Grand Inquisitor'? It's a story that is told in the course of his novel \"The Brothers Karametzov\". The story is that Christ returns/arrives in Spain during the Spanish Inquisition. After a being arrested and having a lengthy discussion with the Grand Inquisitor (head of the Inquisition), Christ is condemmed to be burned at the stake. A point (there are many in the story and I read it a long time ago so my memory fails me) (BTW, I turned 30 this past summer.) of the story is that the Saviour's arrival would be threatening to the Large Established Church that supposedly is 'continuing' the work that the Saviour began - for the sake of his own job and life, the Grand Inqusitor could not let Christ get out his grasp. To me, this is the message of Peter Pumpkinhead. Another point that AP makes with the song is the value of innocence in the face of stodgy, set-in-their-ways opposition. As seen with 'Dear God', Andy has a good eye with pointing the faults of any group that becomes too large and too out of touch. Andy may not be religious, but from other songs I'd say he does have a strong 'spiritual' streak in him. But I still don't think PP is a very good song, lyrically or musically, so there! > ...or \"Books Are Burning\" (pointless guitar solo? When did ANY guitar > solo make a point? It's music, for crying out loud - it both means > something AND nothing) Well, call me silly but I'd rather hear an actual song than a bunch words that preceed and follow a pointless solo. There are plenty guitar solos that make a point, but too many don't. The notion of a solo has been corrupted so that it now stands as the demonstration of (supposed) technical skill instead of serving the song. If I want a pointless solo, I'll listen to some prog-rock/fusion done in 17/8 time from some '70's behemoth (I'd name names, but I know John Relph has/had a hand with some King Crimson web pages!); but Dave (and Andy) have come up with too many good ones that 'Books Are Burning' stands out as an example of a little over indulgence. (And that they wanted to include a 'Hey Jude'-style chorus is just tooo funny. At least then the song would've been a complete write off.) But, I'll agree with Brian's point - how many B-sides has xTc thrown out that (just about) any band would kill to have as an A-side? That there are few bummer songs written by the lads is inevitable given how many songs they've written.

Message-id: <01INH5M5B1WY8XO6N9@jazz.ucc.uno.edu> NOw, who was it who said that one must not be a prude if one ever searches on the net for XTC.....damn were they right! Be sure to always type in the word \"music\" or something, or you're in for an eyeful. I'm so happy....we've FINALLY got computers in the library with graphics, so now I can see the great pictures (of Dave) on all the XTC sites whenever the hell I want to!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also picked up a copy of Joe Jackson's new album....not bad. Actually, I'm not sure how I feel about the song Brad sings on. His voice doesn't sound as good as it normally does. (No cute remarks about \"Well his voice doesn't sound good anyway\", please.) The song Jane Siberry sings on is incredible. I've always loved her voice. And now I must be going to political science class, but before I do, might I just segue back to the days of Agony Andy...how do you think he'd deal with this problem...... Dear Agony Andy, I'm a 19 year old girl who's falling in love with her manager at work. He flirts with me and gives me special treatment, which anyone else would take as a sign that he likes me. One small problem-he's married and has a ten week old baby girl. What's a lovesick girl to do? BLECCH!
