        "text": "LeAnn Rimes shot to fame when she was only thirteen – since then, she has never left that spot. She went on to gain recognition and achieve record-breaking successes. She’s been performing worldwide and making appearances on a seemingly endless number of shows. LeAnn Rimes songs dominated the country charts, not only in the United States but all over the world.\n\nIn honor of LeAnn Rimes‘ impressive career that’s left our jaws on the floor, here’s a look back at some of her greatest hits so far.\n\n1. Can’t Fight the Moonlight\n\nReleased as the soundtrack for the comedy-drama film Coyote Ugly, the romantic ballad became a massive international hit. Fans can’t help but fall in love with its electric mix of hits from the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n“Can’t Fight the Moonlight” reached the top 20 in every country it charted, topping the charts in twelve European countries. Oddly, the song didn’t do so well in the United States. So, Rimes re-released the song with a renewed promotional push. It was then that it ranked No. 11 on Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2. How Do I Live\n\nFresh from the success of her debut single, Rimes crossed over into pop music for the first time with “How Do I Live,” which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard Hot 100. It even made a record for remaining on the said chart for an amazing sixty-nine weeks. It also crossed over internationally to several countries.\n\n3. One Way Ticket (Because I Can)\n\nStrange as it may seem, this upbeat country anthem is Rimes’ only No. 1 hit on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart to date.\n\nWritten by Judy Rodman, the song finds Rimes eager to leave a relationship that’s no longer fulfilling. Now, she is ready to explore all of the delightful opportunities that life has to offer. It comes with the same inspiring music video where Rimes is seen singing around different landmarks in San Francisco.\n\n4. I Need You\n\nRimes has often recorded songs that passionately express her faith – this includes this Christian country-pop ballad that was originally released for Jesus: Music From and Inspired By the Epic Mini Series.\n\nThe soaring ballad later appeared on her compilation album I Need You – which fans may remember as an album publicly disowned by Rimes and was discontinued mere days after its release. Still, the song became another worldwide hit for her.\n\n5. Blue\n\nThe song was written and originally released by country singer Bill Mack in 1958 and has since been covered by several artists. This includes Rimes, who released “Blue” off her debut album when she was only thirteen. Rimes’ version became a massive hit – she even took home a Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and, at the same time, helped Mack win Grammy Award for Best Country Song.\n\n6. Nothing ‘Bout Love Makes Sense\n\nWhile Rimes may have enjoyed her success in the pop music world, she came back to her country roots in the middle of the 2000s – and this country ballad featuring twangy banjo and fiddle instrumentation stood out.\n\n“Nothing ‘Bout Love Makes Sense,” a song which finds Rimes singing about love’s high points and pitfalls as she figures out the realm of love herself, landed at No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n7. Probably Wouldn’t Be This Way\n\nFans got to see another side of Rimes when she traded her upbeat, flirty songs for a haunting tune with a darker tone. While many think this is a usual break-up ballad, some parts of its lyrics suggest that it’s actually about a lover’s death.\n\nIn an interview, Rimes explained that the song tells the story of a woman mourning the loss of her lover and doesn’t know how she will ever move forward.\n\n8. Something’s Gotta Give\n\nWritten by country music songwriters Craig Wiseman and Tony Mullins, this up-tempo ballad tells the story of Jenny, a woman in her thirties who has been searching for a man that’s right for her. Sadly, she has failed several times.\n\nSeveral country fans grieve for the woman that the song became one of Rimes’ highest-peaking country singles – reaching No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n9. Nothin’ Better to Do\n\nRimes made history with “Nothin’ Better to Do” for being the first artist to chart with a single on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary, Hot Country Songs, and Dance Club songs charts at the same time.\n\nCo-written by Rimes, the up-tempo ballad tells the story of a young Mississippi woman running around with some boys. Her mother disapproves of her way of living, but she believes there’s nothing better to do.\n\n10. On the Side of Angels\n\nThe song appeared in the ABC television film Holiday in Your Heart, where Rimes made her acting debut and starred as herself.\n\nWritten by Gary Burr and Gerry House, this slow ballad finds Rimes doubtful to fall in love entirely. But she finds comfort in thinking she’s on the side of angels. After all, only Heaven knows if love is right or wrong.\n\nHere Are Some More LeAnn Rimes Songs That You Need To Check Out\n\nTruly, LeAnn Rimes is one of a kind.
