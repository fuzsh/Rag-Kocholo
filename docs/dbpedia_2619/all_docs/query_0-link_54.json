MUSIC SELECTION – HOW TO CHOOSE?.\n\nIn choosing funeral songs, there are some important things to consider:\n\nWhat music will help you and others in grief?\n\nWhat music did the deceased enjoy most?\n\nConsult with family & friends for suggestions.\n\nListen to the full song or read the lyrics, to make sure that it is appropriate.\n\nReview the selections with the Celebrant, funeral directors, and musician/s.\n\nConsider printing the song lyrics on the funeral programs, if there is a significant meaning.\n\nPeople may read the words or even sing along\n\nDo you want a singer or choir or recorded music?\n\nWhat music is to be played during a photo or video montage during the ceremony?\n\nThe entire song might not be played, unless specifically directed, because of time limitations or other influences.\n\nMUSICIANS.\n\nSome Chapels may have their own musician for hire but you will find a list of talented musicians, including harp players, on my directory Funeral Industry People\n\nSILENCE.\n\nThe complete absence of sound, can be poignant.\n\nThe old cliché’ that ‘silence is golden’ reminds us that you don’t have to have music.\n\nA minute of silence is a way of paying great reverence but often 30 second is sufficient (it is surprising how long a minute of total silence can seem).\n\nSome choose to include a short period of silence as a reflection\n\nOthers have no music at all, as a sign or mourning.\n\nIn military tradition, the bugle or bag pipes, is however played during the period of silence.\n\n.\n\nTOP OF THIS PAGE HOME\n\nSONG LISTS BY GENRE, SUBJECT or CATEGORY.\n\nAngels (‘Angel’ in title or lyrics)\n\nA Broken Wing Martina McBride Angel Aerosmith Angel Aretha Franklin Angel Depeche Mode Angel Fleetwood Mac Angel Jack Johnson Angel Jimi Hendrix Angel Madonna Angel Natasha Bedingfield Angel Sarah McLachlan Angel Shaggy Angel The Weeknd Angel Eyes Love and Theft Angel Eyes the Jeff Healey Band Angel Flying Too Close To the Ground Willie Nelson Angel Friend Rodney Carrington Angel In Blue Jeans Train Angel In the Centerfold J Geils Band Angel In Your Arms Barbara Mandrell Angel Like You Eli Young Band Angel of Harlem U2 Angel Of the Morning Juice Newton Angel With A Shotgun The Cab Angels Jimmy Barnes Angels Robbie Williams Angels Robin Thicke Angels Sarah Brightman Angels Among Us Alabama Angels and Alcohol Alan Jackson Angels and Sailors The Doors Angels Brought Me Here Guy Sebastian Angels Cry Mariah Carey featuring Ne-Yo Angels Fall Sometimes Josh Turner Angels Forever Lana Del Rey Angels In Waiting Tammy Cochran Angel’s Lullaby Richard Marx Angels of the Silences Counting Crows Angels or Devils Dishwalla Angels Standing By Jewel Angels With Dirty Faces Los Lobos Anthem of the Angels Breaking Benjamin Bad Angel Dierks Bentley Broken Angel Hanson Calling All Angels K.D Lang Calling All Angels Train Concrete Angel Martina McBride Cowboys and Angels Garth Brooks Dancing With The Angels Monk & Neagle Earth Angel The Penguins Everyday Angel Radney Roster Fallen Angel Poison Fallen Angel Three Days Grace Guardian Angel Leah West Guardian Angel Lou Reed H.O.L.Y.
