The Band Perry – “If I Die Young” (2010)\n\nThis instant classic tragically lays out bittersweet instructions for “the sharp knife of a short life.”\n\n59. Johnny Lee – “Lookin’ for Love” (1980)\n\nIt’s got a simple message, but it’s the type of song that if you hear it once, you’ll never forget it.\n\n58. Rascal Flatts – “What Hurts the Most” (2003)\n\nIf you had just one song to encapsulate the Rascal Flatts sound, it’s this devastating breakup song.\n\n57.

Tanya Tucker – “Delta Dawn” (1972)\n\nFew could belt like Tanya Tucker, and the haunting “Delta Dawn” was her crowning masterpiece.\n\n15. Johnny Cash – “Folsom Prison Blues” (1955)\n\nThe Man in Black jammed for a live prison crowd, hollering their approval with each edgy line.\n\n14. Dolly Parton – “I Will Always Love You” (1974)\n\nWhitney Houston’s cover became the definitive version, but Dolly’s original made it all possible.\n\n13. Randy Travis – “Forever and Ever, Amen” (1987)\n\nThe most unique voice in country music turned a simple love song into something downright spiritual.\n\n12. Garth Brooks – “The Dance” (1990)\n\nGarth is a rambunctious stage performer, but when he slows it down, he brings absolute chills.\n\n11. Willie Nelson – “Always on My Mind” (1982)\n\nElvis sang this tale of lost love before Willie Nelson elevated it to Grammy-winning legendary status.\n\n10. David Allan Coe – “The Ride” (1983)\n\nIs there a premise cooler than a hitchhiker getting a ride from the ghost of Hank Williams?\n\n9. Conway Twitty – “Hello Darlin'” (1970)\n\nWith one of the genre’s smoothest voices, Conway Twitty created a classic song for parting lovers.\n\n8. Charlie Rich – “Behind Closed Doors” (1973)\n\nThe lyrics tell of lovers who don’t flaunt their feelings in public, because they burn it down in private.\n\n7. Tammy Wynette – “Stand by Your Man” (1968)\n\nGender politics aside, it’s a monumental piece of country history boasting a rafter-shaking voice.\n\n6. George Strait – “Amarillo By Morning” (1983)\n\nThe painterly imagery, clever turns of phrases and timeless cowboy themes make this one eternal.\n\n5. Hank Williams – “Your Cheatin’ Heart” (1952)\n\nThe father of country music lent his signature twang of pain to the ultimate anti-cheating song.\n\n4. Johnny Cash – “I Walk the Line” (1956)\n\nIn a genre of cheating songs, Cash flipped it to pen his steadfast devotion to June Carter Cash.\n\n3. Patsy Cline – “Crazy” (1962)\n\nOne of history’s most famous songs, regardless of genre, Patsy’s voice was from another world.\n\n2. George Jones – “He Stopped Loving Her Today” (1980)\n\nPoetic, creative lyrics tell a haunting tale of a man who only stops loving a woman the day he dies.\n\n1. Garth Brooks – “Friends in Low Places” (1990)\n\nThis saloon singalong has taken on a life of its own that will outlive Garth Brooks and the rest of us.\n\nVERDICT: If it feels odd placing such a living, touring artist like Garth Brooks atop such legends as Hank Williams and Johnny Cash, consider this: Garth Brooks just passed Elvis Presley as the top-selling solo artist of all-time and trails only The Beatles for the overall top slot. End of story. No further evidence, your honor."
