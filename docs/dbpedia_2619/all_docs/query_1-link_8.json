        "text": "American singer (born 1982)\n\nFor the Australian snowboarder, see Adam Lambert (snowboarder).\n\nNot to be confused with Adam Lamberg.\n\nAdam Mitchel Lambert (born January 29, 1982) is an American singer. He is known for his dynamic vocal performances that combine his theatrical training with modern and classic genres.[4] Lambert rose to fame in 2009 after finishing as runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol.[5] Later that year, he released his debut album For Your Entertainment, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200.[6] The album spawned several singles, including \"Whataya Want from Me\", for which he received a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.[7]\n\nIn 2012, Lambert released his second studio album Trespassing. The album premiered at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making him the first openly gay artist to top the album charts.[8] In 2015, Lambert released his third album The Original High, which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the single \"Ghost Town\".[9] Since 2009, he has sold over 3 million albums and 5 million singles worldwide.[10][11]\n\nAlongside his solo career, Lambert has performed with Queen in several worldwide tours from 2012. Their first album, Live Around the World, was released in October 2020, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.[12]\n\nIn late 2019, Lambert founded the non-profit Feel Something Foundation, anchoring his ongoing philanthropy, LGBTQ+ and human rights activism. Its particular focus is support for organizations and projects that directly and disproportionately impact the LGBTQ+ community, including education and the arts, mental health, suicide prevention and homelessness.[13]\n\nLambert is set to make his Broadway debut as the Emcee in the 2024 revival of Cabaret on September 16.[14]\n\nEarly life and family\n\nLambert was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on January 29, 1982,[15] to mother Leila, a dental hygienist; and father Eber Lambert, a program manager for Novatel Wireless. His father is of partial Norwegian descent and his mother is Jewish, with roots in Romania.[16] Lambert was raised in his mother's religion.[17] He has a younger brother, Neil.[18] Shortly after his birth, his family moved to San Diego, California.[19]\n\nLambert began performing with Metropolitan Educational Theatre network (now MET2) from the age of nine.[19] A few years later, he began more intense acting and vocal coaching, continuing to perform with both MET2 and what was to become the Broadway Bound Youth Theatre Foundation, as he moved through Mesa Verde Middle School and then Mount Carmel High School.[18] There, he became heavily involved with theater and choir, performed vocals with the school's jazz band, and competed in the local Air Bands competitions.[19] He also appeared in local professional productions such as Hello, Dolly!, Camelot, The Music Man, Grease, Chess and Peter Pan, at venues such as The Starlight, The Lyceum and others.[19][20]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 2000, he attended California State University, Fullerton. His major was musical theater, but left after five weeks to move to Los Angeles: \"I just decided that what I really wanted to do was try to work in the real entertainment world. Life is all about taking risks to get what you want.\"[21][20]\n\nCareer\n\n2001â€“2008: Career beginnings\n\nAt 19, Lambert got his first professional job, performing on a cruise ship for ten months with Anita Mann Productions. Afterwards, he performed in light opera in Orange County, California. By 21, he was signed with a manager and cast in a European tour of Hair.[22] In 2004, he appeared in the Theatre Under the Stars (TUTS) production of Brigadoon[23] and a Pasadena Playhouse production of 110 in the Shade,[19] before being cast in the role of Joshua in The Ten Commandments: The Musical at the Kodak Theatre alongside Val Kilmer.[24] He came to the attention of the casting director for Wicked, and was hired as the understudy for the role of Fiyero and an ensemble member in the first national touring production of the musical from 2005, and the Los Angeles production from 2007. He finished performances with the musical in 2008.[19]\n\nDuring this same period, Lambert briefly fronted underground rock band The Citizen Vein with Steve Sidelnyk, Tommy Victor and Monte Pittman.[25] He also worked as a demo singer and a session musician; a compilation of his 2005 recordings was later released in 2009 on the album Take One.[26]\n\n2009-2011: American Idol, For Your Entertainment, and Glam Nation Tour\n\nIn 2009, Lambert auditioned for the eighth season of American Idol in San Francisco, California by singing \"Rock with You\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[25] Advancing to Hollywood Week, he performed \"What's Up\" and \"Believe\" solo, and \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" in the group effort.[27] Simon Cowell voiced some concern about his theatricality, but Randy Jackson found it \"current\".[25] He advanced easily to the top 36 performing \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".[27] In the first week of live shows, his rendition of Michael Jackson's \"Black or White\" was praised by all four judges.[28] For Country week, he sang a sitar-infused version of \"Ring of Fire\". His Motown night acoustic version of The Miracles' \"The Tracks of My Tears\" drew praise from judges and a standing ovation from Smokey Robinson, the week's mentor. Advancing to the top 8, he sang the 2001 Michael Andrews and Gary Jules arrangement of \"Mad World\". Because the show exceeded its time slot, only Cowell gave a critique, which he did by giving Lambert a standing ovation, the only one he bestowed during his decade-long run as an American Idol judge.[28] After Lambert sang \"If I Can't Have You\", delivering what DioGuardi called his \"most memorable performance\", Cowell described his vocals as \"immaculate\". For the top 3 show, he performed \"One\" before Cowell declared, \"If you are not in the final next week, it will be one of the biggest upsets\"; and continued with \"Cryin'\" before Abdul affirmed, \"we'll be seeing you next week and many years after that\".[28]\n\nIn March 2009, photos of Lambert kissing another man while dressed in drag at Burning Man surfaced online.[29] Highlighted as controversial, they were displayed by conservative commentators on The O'Reilly Factor, who called them \"embarrassing\" and questioned if the images would have an effect on the program.[30] Fox restricted press access to Lambert and to his family following the outing.[31] Despite conservative backlash, outlets such as The New York Times and ABC News speculated that Lambert would be too popular to lose the competition.[31][30] Upon the announcement of Lambert as runner-up, American Idol pundits, gay bloggers, and LGBT news outlets reassessed these claims, noting that his queerness may have alienated conservative viewers.[32][33]\n\nLambert performed three solos in the finale, a reprise of \"Mad World\", followed by the 1960s civil rights anthem \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", to tremendously positive judge reaction. After his performance of the mandatory winner's single, \"No Boundaries\" Cowell summed up Lambert's journey: \"Over the entire season, you've been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show. The hope and whole idea of a show like this is to find a worldwide star, and I truly believe we've found that in you\".[28] Upon winning the competition, Kris Allen stated: \"Adam deserved this\", later explaining he thought Lambert deserved to win as much as he did, and that Lambert \"was the most consistent person all year. He was seriously one of the most gifted performers that I've ever met\".[34] Lambert's version of the winner's single was released alongside Allen's. The Los Angeles Times later ranked Lambert fifth in its list of the top 120 American Idol contestants, selected from the first nine seasons of the show, above Allen.[35]\n\nAmerican Idol season 8 performances and results Week # Theme Song choice Original artist Order # Result Audition Auditioner's Choice \"Rock with You\"\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Michael Jackson\n\nQueen N/A Advanced Hollywood First Solo \"What's Up\" 4 Non Blondes N/A Advanced Hollywood Group Performance \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" Soul Brothers Six N/A Advanced Hollywood Second Solo \"Believe\" Cher N/A Advanced Top 36/Semi-final 2 Billboard Hot 100 Hits to Date \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" The Rolling Stones 12 Advanced Top 13 Michael Jackson \"Black or White\" Michael Jackson 11 Safe Top 11 Grand Ole Opry \"Ring of Fire\" Anita Carter 5 Safe Top 10 Motown \"The Tracks of My Tears\" The Miracles 8 Safe Top 9 Top Downloads \"Play That Funky Music\" Wild Cherry 8 Safe Top 8 Year they Were Born (1982) \"Mad World\" Tears for Fears 8 Safe Top 7 Songs from the Cinema \"Born to Be Wild\" â€“ Easy Rider Steppenwolf 3 Safe Top 7 Disco \"If I Can't Have You\" Yvonne Elliman 5 Safe Top 5 Rat Pack Standards \"Feeling Good\" Cy Grant 5 Bottom 2 Top 4 Rock and Roll Solo\n\nDuet \"Whole Lotta Love\"\n\n\"Slow Ride\" with Allison Iraheta Led Zeppelin\n\nFoghat 1\n\n6 Safe Top 3 Judge's Choice (Simon Cowell)\n\nContestant's Choice \"One\"\n\n\"Cryin'\" U2\n\nAerosmith 3\n\n6 Safe Top 2 Contestant's Choice\n\nSimon Fuller's Choice\n\nCoronation Song \"Mad World\"\n\n\"A Change Is Gonna Come\"\n\n\"No Boundaries\" Tears for Fears\n\nSam Cooke\n\nKris Allen/Adam Lambert 1\n\n3\n\n5 Runner-up\n\nNote Due to the judges using their one save to save Matt Giraud, the Top 7 remained intact for another week.\n\nLambert performed \"Mad World\" on The Early Show[36] and Live with Regis and Kelly.[37] He began the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2009 in July and that summer was also the recipient of two awards: the Young Hollywood Award for Artist of the Year and the Teen Choice Award for Male Reality/Variety Star at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards.[38][39]\n\nFor Your Entertainment, Lambert's first studio album, was released on November 23, 2009. Debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and selling 198,000 copies in the US its first week,[6] the album saw Lambert in collaboration with producers such as Rob Cavallo, Dr. Luke and Max Martin. Album writers included Matthew Bellamy, Ryan Tedder, Rivers Cuomo, Justin Hawkins, P!nk, Linda Perry and Lady Gaga.[40] At Metacritic, the album received a score of 71, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Spin said the album is \"perhaps the strongest, most flavorful batch of tunes to reach an AI vet, and Lambert's polymorphous vocal skills unite dancefloor strut and hard-rock pomp in a convincing glam package\". Rolling Stone, however, gave it a more mixed review: \"The songs sound great but feel strangely stuffyâ€”[it] seems like a disc that was overthought. Next time, the hugely talented Lambert should make sure he's going straight for the gut.\"[41]\n\nIts Claude Kelly and Dr. Luke-produced lead single \"For Your Entertainment\" preceded the album's release but was not as successful as its second single \"Whataya Want from Me\" which impacted on charts worldwide, became his highest-peaking single (at number 10) on the Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 53rd awards ceremony. Another notable single was \"Time for Miracles\", the ending theme for the disaster movie 2012. As of April 2012 , For Your Entertainment has sold nearly 2 million copies worldwide[42] and was certified gold in the US in June 2010.[43] On November 22, Lambert performed \"For Your Entertainment\" at the American Music Awards of 2009. The controversial performance, which was the night's finale, showed Lambert kissing a male bassist and grabbing the crotch of another.[44] In response, the Parents Television Council, a conservative decency group, urged viewers to complain to the FCC and launched a formal complaintâ€”though the performance aired \"outside the FCC's usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material\".[45] After receiving about 1,500 telephoned complaints, ABC canceled Lambert's November 25 performance on Good Morning America, canceled his upcoming performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and removed him from consideration for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.[46] Discussing the incident in a Rolling Stone interview, Lambert said: \"Female performers have been doing this for yearsâ€”pushing the envelope about sexualityâ€”and the minute a man does it, everybody freaks out. We're in 2009â€”it's time to take risks, be a little more brave, time to open people's eyes and if it offends them, then maybe I'm not for them. My goal was not to piss people off, it was to promote freedom of expression and artistic freedom.\"[44] Lambert returned two years later as a presenter at the American Music Awards of 2011 and was warmly received. Rejecting claims that the singer was banned from the show in 2009, executive producer Larry Klein said that he was anticipating future Lambert performances: \"Adam Lambert is a friend of ours, he's talented and I like everything about him\".[47] Lambert's performance was included in Billboard's list of \"Top Ten American Music Awards Moments\" on the eve of its 40th anniversary, in November 2012.[48]\n\nIn the months leading to his album release, Lambert appeared on the cover of magazines such as Entertainment Weekly in May 2009,[49] Rolling Stone in June 2009[50] and Details in November 2009.[51] His Rolling Stone cover story became the magazine's best selling issue of the year.[52] He appeared on the cover of Out magazine in their 2009 \"Out 100\" issue, sparking controversy as Out's publisher issued him an open letter questioning the \"gayness\" of his image.[53] In April, he became one of People Magazine's Most Beautiful People 2010.[54] He was chosen for Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People of 2009, and interviewed on the show of December 10.[55] In late 2009, he performed on the Late Show with David Letterman,[56] The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien,[57] the season finale of So You Think You Can Dance,[58] The Jay Leno Show[59] and The Oprah Winfrey Show.[60] He performed his first official solo concert, which sold-out, at Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California.[61]\n\nIn April 2010, Lambert returned to American Idol on season 9 as the first former contestant to mentor contestants during an Elvis Presley themed week, where he also performed.[62] In June, he appeared on Canada's 2010 MuchMusic Video Awards to receive the UR Fav International Video award for \"Whataya Want from Me\".[63]\n\nIn early June 2010, Lambert embarked on his debut headlining Glam Nation Tour, playing in the United States, Europe and Asia for 113 shows, nearly all of them sold out.[64] The Indianapolis show was filmed for Lambert's first video release Glam Nation Live, a 13-track CD with DVD.[65] The concert, which MTV called \"out of this world\", and his subsequent video release, were well-received, with Entertainment Weekly saying it \"sizzles\" with the energy that Lambert's vocals bring in a live concert setting.[66] Glam Nation Live debuted at number one on the SoundScan Music Video chart[67] and landed at number 12 on Billboard's 2011 year-end music video sales chart.[68] This followed the release of his first extended play, Acoustic Live!, consisting of acoustic versions of songs recorded live in various countries. The EP garnered excellent reviews and was called \"electrifying\" by the New York Daily News.[69][70] In March 2011, Lambert appeared on American Idol season 10 to perform his song \"Aftermath\" and in August, he was profiled in an hour-long documentary for VH1's Behind the Music series.[71] Later in 2011, he again appeared as a mentor on a singing competition, this time on The Hub's Majors & Minors, coaching singing contestants who were children.[72] In November 2011, Lambert joined Queen as the lead singer at the MTV Europe Music Awards, where the band was honored with the Global Icon Award and performed a medley of classic hits.[73]\n\nLambert changed management from 19 Entertainment to Direct Management Group in August 2011.[74] The title track of his second studio album, Trespassing, was co-written with Pharrell Williams; while the album's lead single, \"Better Than I Know Myself\", a collaboration with Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly, was released digitally on December 20, 2011.[75]\n\n2012â€“2013: Trespassing\n\nTrespassing was released on May 15, 2012, to positive reviews.[3][76][77] On May 23, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 77,000 copies.[78] and at number three in United Kingdom's midweek chart.[79] His second single \"Never Close Our Eyes\", written by Bruno Mars and produced by Dr. Luke, was released digitally on April 17, to positive reviews.[80][81] Lambert returned to American Idol for his third consecutive year on the results show that preceded season 11's finale week. The performance of May 17 of \"Never Close Our Eyes\" was touted for its vibrant energy and dazzle, as well as for the powerhouse vocals that had become his signature.[82][83]\n\nThroughout the spring and summer of 2012, Lambert performed across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia, appearing in festivals, on radio and television, and in concert, including one of several headlining spots at Summer Sonic Festival 2012.[84] In September, he appeared on the season 1 finale of The Voice of China, the country's most popular program.[85] Lambert joined Queen for a six concert date collaboration tour, kicking off with a two-hour extravaganza under the auspices of the UEFA in Kyiv on June 30, the eve of the Euro 2012 Football Championship. Viewed live by hundreds of thousands in Ukraine's main square,[86] the performance was touted for the strength of Lambert's showmanship, vocal excellence and interpretative skill, which confidently balanced old and new.[87] Almost uniformly, reviews noted Lambert's vocals, his \"sizzle\" and \"electrifying\" presence; along with the synergy of the collaboration, which Queen guitarist Brian May called \"organic\".[88]\n\nLambert's third single, \"Trespassing\", was released as part of an eight track EP of remixes that included a radio edit of the original song. Entitled Trespassing Remixes, it became available to radio and digital outlets in October, with hard copies sold from his official website only.[89] \"Trespassing\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart, giving Lambert his tenth number one Billboard entry.[2] On October 23, Lambert acted and performed two songs from Trespassing in the Halloween special of the television series Pretty Little Liars.[90]\n\nLambert appeared for the first time in South Africa in November, headlining arena concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg.[91] South Africa's The Sunday Times called Lambert's Johannesburg performance \"epic\" and \"electrifying\", stating: \"His voice is stunning and his entertainment factor is through the roof.\"[92] Later that month he was in Hong Kong delivering a \"powerful performance\" at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards (2012 MAMA.)[93]\n\nThe album Trespassing was rewarded in year end lists and polls, among them best album of the year at Rolling Stone,[94] number three at Billboard for \"Favorite 200 No.1\" albums,[95] and number eight on People magazine's list of \"Top Ten Music\" in its year end issue.[96] Queen + Adam Lambert was named best live act of 2012 at Gigwise,[97] and one of Classic Rock magazine's top events of the year.[98]\n\nLambert left 19 Recordings when his contract expired, but remained with RCA Records.[99] On February 17, the newly dubbed We Are Glamily Tour kicked off in Seoul, with seventeen stops throughout Asia and Europe.[100] His first solo concert in Hong Kong on March 5 was noted for the live debut of two songs, \"Time for Miracles\" and a cover of Tears for Fears' \"Shout\", called \"stunning\" and vocally impressive.[101]\n\nLambert won the \"Favorite International Artist\" category at the STAR TV 17th Chinese Music Awards held in Macau in April, also performing two songs from Trespassing.[102] Lambert also appeared as a guest judge during auditions on Chinese Idol.[103] On May 11, Lambert for his album Trespassing along with Frank Ocean for Channel Orange were co-recipients of the award for Outstanding Music Artist at the 24th GLAAD Media Awards.[104] He returned to American Idol on May 16 for the fourth consecutive year, performing a duet with Angie Miller on the twelfth season finale, where Miller was a finalist in the top three. The pair tackled the song \"Titanium\".[105]\n\nIn a letter sent to The Hollywood Reporter on July 12, Lambert revealed that he would be leaving RCA due to \"creative differences\" centering most directly on his next release. With RCA \"pushing\" for a covers album, Lambert stated: \"my heart is simply not in doing a covers album ... I am already deep into writing new material with some very talented colleagues for a brand new album, and I can't tell you how excited I am to share this new sound and direction. This music is where my heart is\".[106]\n\nLambert unveiled a collaboration with Nile Rodgers and DJ-producer Avicii when the three appeared onstage together for the track's US debut at an August benefit concert on Long Island.[107] The song, entitled \"Lay Me Down\", released on Avicii's debut album True on September 17 in the US, though it had already begun climbing charts worldwide.[108] It received wide acclaim in previews, and landed at number one on a compilation of Rolling Stone's favorite songs, albums and videos.[109]\n\nLambert and Queen made their first live concert appearance in the United States, closing the night on September 20, at the 2013 iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand Arena. Reviews for the performance were stellar, with Rolling Stone stating that they dominated night one, also calling them most anticipated act of the evening, with Lambert \"astound[ing] the audience\".[110] Billboard was equally laudatory, remarking on the \"magnetic power\" of the vocals, adding that Lambert \"oozed charisma\".[111]\n\nLambert made his debut on the fifth season of Glee on November 7, playing the role of Elliot \"Starchild\" Gilbert in what became a multi-episode arc.

He'd just come out onstage, and it popped\".[321] Record producer Rob Cavallo once described Lambert as having an unlimited range and able to sing every note on a guitar from the lowest to the highest.[322] In a March 2012 interview, rock artist Meat Loaf rated Lambert's voice in the company of only two others, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin, based on \"that jet pack quality to their voice that just lets it take off.\"[323]\n\nIn 2011, when he took the stage at the MTV Europe Music Awards, honoree Queen guitarist Brian May noted that Lambert's voice has \"sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop\";[324] while Roger Taylor added that Lambert had \"the best range I've ever heard\" in a BBC interview in 2012.[325] Pharrell Williams, after collaborating with Lambert on his Trespassing album, commented, \"This kid has a voice like a siren â€“ there's no guys singing in that Steve Winwood-Peter Cetera range.\"[326]\n\nIn October 2012, the Sunday Mirror reported that Lambert insured his voice for $48 million. A source told the tabloid newspaper: \"Insurance for stars is a big deal in the US and Adam's voice is his bacon.\"[327]\n\nIn a 2019 interview James Michael, lead vocalist for the band Sixx:A.M., praised Lambert's vocal technique, power and the facility of his vocal control - judging him one of the best vocalists in the world.[328]\n\nStyle and image\n\nLambert is best known for his theatrical performance style and meticulous attention to detail in all aspects of his personal presentation. He draws upon extensive stage experience in the ease with which he can refine and define his image through fashion and other imagery, which are essential to how he chooses to inhabit his songs, rivet his audiences and showcase his individuality.[329] While a contestant on American Idol, Lambert's precise yet varied stagings of himself kept audiences and judges glued as much to his presentation as to his vocal talent.[330] His signature flamboyance and glam rock styling was a break-out moment in men's fashion, duly noted by fashion publications and taste-makers, who compared him to Lady Gaga in terms of crossing style boundaries and being unabashedly individual.[331][332]\n\nLambert made three fashion related TV appearances at the close of 2010. He fused his passion for music and fashion on MTV's \"Talk@Playground\", appearing in discussion with Skingraft designer Jonny Cota.[333] He was a guest judge on Project Runway in an episode that styled a rock band for their upcoming Rolling Stone cover.[334] He was the subject for whom the young designers of \"All on the Line with Joe Zee\" created a modern look, which he then critiqued along with the show's hosts.[335]\n\nLambert continued to grace the covers of magazines, moving more specifically into the fashion and culture space.[336][337] Reflecting the mood and concept behind his album Trespassing, the Fault Magazine fashion shoot exemplified Lambert's commitment to aligning the elements of his artistic vision so that a cohesive narrative emerges.[338] When Lambert appeared on the December 2012 cover of London-based high style magazine Fiasco's \"Obsession\" issue, he again took the opportunity to manipulate and provoke with his image and style. Sporting a sophisticated, minimalist look that recalled old Hollywood, Lambert played with male stereotypes and representations; and in the interview, emphasized that his fashion and presentation are often disparate from gay as well as straight regimes: \"For the general audience, they look at the way I style myself and they go, 'Errrr, that's gay', but you ask a handful of gay guys and they're like, 'I would never wear that!'\"[339][340]\n\nIn August 2015, he was one of four artists to appear on the cover of Billboard's \"Music's Men of Style\" issue. He discussed his natural shift towards a cleaner, more classic look; and reiterated that the intersection of music and fashionâ€”the constant motion of trendsâ€”is a fascination and part of being a pop musician.[341]\n\nLambert is represented by London-based MiLK Management modeling agency as of July 2016 .[10]\n\nInfluences\n\nLambert was inspired when his father gave him access to his large record collection of 1970s music. He was attracted to theatrical rock from artists like Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Aerosmith. Among his strongest influences are British singers such as Freddie Mercury, David Bowie and Robert Plant: \"Those are the people I really gravitate towards\".[342] Lambert referred to Michael Jackson and Madonna as \"King and Queen\" because they creatively merged music with makeup, fashion and cinematic video.[343][344] He also cites Christina Aguilera as an inspiration to him as a vocalist.[345][346]\n\nIn March 2013, Lambert wrote an article for Out magazine's tribute to David Bowie, who was about to release a new album. In it, he explained how Bowie helped inform the expression of his own sexuality and gender in his work: \"A light bulb went offâ€”I wasn't into drag, I didn't want to dress like a woman, but I wanted to express my gender and artistic identity differently than the mainstream. Bowie was a key inspiration. It was about the androgyny of mixing it up, and that was what was so incredible about his conceptsâ€”he was one of the first rock stars to really push the idea that sexuality was not black and white but an exploration\".[347]\n\nLambert's own music has been influenced by numerous genres including classic rock, pop, and electronic music; and his performance style draws heavily from his stage experience.[348] Lambert envisions himself as the type of artist \"that creates from the ground up, not only an amazing song, but one with a beat, and a story, and a look, and a theme\".[344] For his second album, he used inspiration from classic disco, 1990s electronica, funk and dubstep music.[326]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSince his appearance on American Idol, Lambert has lent considerable support and time to charitable causes. As of October 2011 , financial donations reached the $1,000,000 mark.[349]\n\nIn January 2010, in lieu of gifts for his 28th birthday, Lambert asked fans to donate to DonorsChoose.org, as 2,435 fans donated $322,700.[350] In June 2010, Lambert teamed with the charity for his \"Glam A Classroom\" campaign, raising another $208,590, supported by 3,020 fans.[351] In October 2010, he collaborated on a second Signature Collection with The Pennyroyal Studio, which sold out after raising $43,092 for DonorsChoose.[352] Lambert contributed to the MusiCares charity when he and The Pennyroyal Studio collaborated on the design of an Eye of Horus pendant, whose sale raised $32,000 in 7 days.[353]\n\nIn January 2011, he began a campaign to raise $29,000 for charity: water to commemorate his 29th birthday and the campaign raised $323,803, which helped 16,190 people receive clean water.[354] He continued his efforts for his 30th birthday, in January 2012, this time asking fans to \"give up\" their birthdays in an ongoing drive that raised $82,000 by May 2012.[355] In June 2013, an accounting by charity:water listed 55 projects thus far completed with funds raised by Lambert.[356]\n\nLambert returned to the American Idol stage for the March 10, 2011, results show, singing an acoustic version of his For Your Entertainment track \"Aftermath\". After the performance, a dance remix version was made available for purchase, with proceeds benefiting The Trevor Project.[357]\n\nLambert performed at a Royal Albert Hall concert on June 7, 2012, benefiting the Rays Of Sunshine Children's Charity.[358] On June 30, Elton John and Queen + Adam Lambert coordinated with the Olena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation for a concert to benefit the fight against HIV/AIDS.[359] On September 25, 2012, Lambert headlined a fundraising benefit in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Marylanders for Marriage Equality.[360]\n\nOn January 31, 2013, he received the Unity Award, which honors artists whose music spreads \"peaceful messages\", from the We Are Family Foundation at their 2012 Celebration Gala 2.0.[361] Lambert \"donated\" his 31st birthday to the charity, raising more than $82,000 in just over a week.[362] For his 32nd birthday, he chose the charity again, coordinating with artist Chris Saunders on the creation of limited and open edition prints and posters whose sales benefited the foundation.[363] On May 25, Lambert was a participant in the opening ceremony of 2013 Life Ball in Vienna.[364] Appearing as Ali Baba, he performed the gala's official song, \"Love Wins Over Glamour\", which he co-wrote with the Vienna-based production team Beat4Feet.[365] On June 23, he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to open Broadway Bares to benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.[366] Lambert was a featured performer at the August 19 Dance Party event in Riverhead, Long Island, benefiting All for the East End (AFTEE).[107] On November 2, he was the musical entertainer for South Florida's Make-A-Wish Foundation Ball.[367] The sold-out 2013 Ball raised a record-breaking 2 million dollars.[368]\n\nLambert was featured in the video launch for UNICEF's #IMAGINE campaign.[369] In collaboration with Queen, he is a participant in Coca-Cola's [RED] campaign to help end mother-to-child HIV transmission.[370] In June 2015, he performed at the Roundhouse for the \"One for the Boys\" Fashion Ball.[371] Earlier that month, he performed at the \"Live Aid Uusi Lastensairaala\" concert in Finland.[372] In July 2016, he took part in the charity single \"Hands\", a tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.[373]\n\nIn August 2017, Lambert performed a mini-set tribute to George Michael at Project Angel Food's Angel Awards gala, where Michael was the recipient of the Elizabeth Taylor Humanitarian Award, in recognition of his philanthropy.[374] Lambert through his \"Feel Something Foundation\" again worked with the charity in November 2020 to deliver medically tailored Thanksgiving meals to those most vulnerable during COVID.[375] He performed a duet in October with Cynthia Erivo for the virtual 2020 Carousel of Hope Ball in support of the Children's Diabetes Foundation.[376] In July 2021, he helped raise $1.1 million in funds for Project Angel Food during their KTLA telethon.[377]\n\nLGBT advocacy and social activism\n\nLambert has been a contributor to social justice.[378] Lambert stated, \"I feel like with celebrity and visibility and fame, there's a responsibility to try to give back and try to use the visibility for the greater good. It's not all about me. It's about trying to raise awareness and getting people to take action.\"[379] His heavily provocative AMA performance, featuring a gay kiss on live television, served to push societal boundaries by highlighting a double standard of ethics in media regulation as well.[44][380]\n\nLambert received a nomination for Outstanding Music Artist at the 21st GLAAD Media Awards in 2010. The same year, he lent his voice to a one-and-a-half-minute video message on YouTube for the It Gets Better campaign â€“ a project created by columnist Dan Savage in response to school bullying and a rash of suicides among LGBT youth.[381]\n\nLambert was presented the \"Equality Idol Award\" by Sam Sparro at the Equality California Los Angeles Equality Awards in August 2011 for being an exemplary role model for the LGBT community.[382] He was honored with his mother the following month at the PFLAG National Los Angeles event for his \"authentic\" voice.[383] The following March, he released a Billboard remix version of his For Your Entertainment song \"Aftermath\" with a portion of the proceeds going to support The Trevor Project, the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBT youth.[384] He raised an additional $43,500 for The Trevor Project after collaborating with The Pennyroyal Studio to make his own Peace pendant.[385][386] In October 2011, donations on behalf of the Adam Lambert Glambert Fan Army for the MTV Dance Party Marathon raised funds to combat bullying in honor of National Bullying Prevention Month.[387] Lambert was a participant in Spirit Day, a movement begun in 2010 to honor LGBT lives lost to suicide, \"going purple\" in the push to support LGBT youth in the fight against bullying.[388] In December, he performed at the \"Cyndi Lauper & Friends: Home for the Holidays\" benefit concert, which raised funds in support of the \"True Colors Fund\" and the organization's \"Forty to None Project\", targeting the epidemic of homelessness among LGBT youth.[389] In January 2012, in an exclusive interview with UK music news magazine Pressparty, Lambert noted that despite social progress in the US, there was still a long way to go, particularly in the music industry: \"I still long for the LGBT community's diversity to be more broadly represented in the entertainment industry. I think larger strides have been made in film and TV but we still are just at the beginning with mainstream music. I consider myself a post-gay man working in a pre-gay industry.\"[390]\n\nLambert was the headline performer at the Miami Beach Gay Pride Parade and Festival on April 14, 2013, and was also given the key to the city.[391] Lambert was presented with the prestigious GLAAD Davidson/Valentini Award on May 11 in San Francisco. The honorary award is bestowed yearly to out media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equal rights in the LGBT community.[392] On May 30, he was honored with the \"Hope of Los Angeles Award\" as part of the city's 3rd Annual LGBT Heritage Month.[393] Lambert is featured in \"The New F Word\" campaign sponsored by the grassroots Friend Movement organization, which has launched a global effort aimed at self-empowerment and raising anti-bullying awareness through positive images in media and the arts.[394] On June 15, declared \"Adam Lambert Day\" by the City Council,[395] he headlined Pittsburgh's \"Pride in the Street\" concert.[396] In honor of Pride season, Lambert partnered with AT&T and The Trevor Project for the \"Live Proud Campaign\", aiming to empower and raise awareness in the LGBTQ community.[397] The $50,000 goal was met and on July 3 a check presentation was made to The Trevor Project during the private finale show given by Lambert.[398] At the October 15 Los Angeles premiere of the movie Bridegroom, Lambert revealed that he donated a song to the score, and felt \"humbled\" to be connected to the project.

Mosaic is an organization that seeks to support, educate and inspire by offering a safe space and variety of programs for LGBTQ+ youth.[412]\n\nIn January 2020, Lambert launched an LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy group called the Feel Something Foundation, a name it shares with his first single release from the album Velvet. Its mission is to support \"LGBTQ+ organizations that are moving the needle for communities of all ages and backgrounds,\" and impacting important areas of LGBTQ life. Another specific goal is to \"abolish 'coming out' as a term used to define someone simply being themselves.\"[413] During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the Foundation in partnership with eBay launched two charity auctions of Lambert's stage-wear, with funds raised directed to GLAAD for LGBTQ people in need. The auction in June kicked off a series of events for Pride 2020 in support of GLAAD's youth engagement programs, including a panel with their Campus Ambassadors from around the US.[414] In April 2020, Lambert had participated in GLAAD's Together in Pride: You Are Not Alone livestream event, raising funds for LGBTQ community centers providing critical services during COVID.[415] In early June, he announced a sizable donation from the Foundation to the LGBTQ Freedom Fund, to assist with bail for community members that were arrested during peaceful protests of Black Lives Matter.[416] On June 28, the Pride Music Business Creatives Roundtable was hosted by the Foundation, with Lambert and special guest artists discussing discrimination in the industry, their own coming out stories, and steps forward toward LGBTQ equalty.[417] Other notable Pride performances included \"Can't Cancel Pride\" to support multiple LGBTQ+ organizations;[418] and Global Pride, a 24-hour live-stream event, at which he also spoke on behalf of Black Lives Matter and people of color in the community.[419] Lambert featured in a speaking segment on Conde Nast's LGBTQ brand them.'s \"Out Now Live\", a virtual pride celebration to educate, entertain and raise money for the Ali Forney Center targeting LGBTQ youth homelessness.[420] In December he again performed for Cyndi Lauper's annual \"Home for the Holidays\" benefit concert for True Colors United, which works to combat homelessness in LGBTQ+ youth.[421] He hosted the first of two Stonewall Day Unplugged sessions on February 18 as part of the lead up to the June Stonewall Day celebration that Lambert, through his Feel Something Foundation, headlined and curated with Pride Live.[13]\n\nThe resulting OUTLOUD: Raising Voices event in 2021 featured a \"queer for queer\" lineup of LGBTQ artists.[422] On March 4, he participated in a celebratory event in support of the Center for Gender-Affirming Care at San Diego's Rady Children's Hospital.[423] Lambert, through his Feel Something Foundation, teamed up with Soundwaves Art Foundation in late March to create art prints, 100% of whose sale's profits would benefit The Trevor Project.[424][non-primary source needed] He appeared on the Los Angeles LGBT Center's Love in Action telethon on August 14, 2021.[425]In collaboration with his Feel Something Foundation, he directed his 2023 and 2024 birthday donations to the non-profit \"Stand with Trans\", whose support for queer mental health and wellness aligns with his foundation's.[426][non-primary source needed]\n\nIn October 2023, Lambert signed the Artists4Ceasefire open letter to Joe Biden, President of the United States, calling for a ceasefire of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.[427]\n\nPersonal life\n\nAfter being outed on the internet during his bid to win American Idol, Adam Lambert confirmed that he was gay in a Rolling Stone cover interview that was published in June 2009.[428] He was in a relationship with Finnish entertainment reporter and reality TV personality Sauli Koskinen from November 2010 until April 2013, when Lambert announced that the couple had split up amicably.[429] From March to November 2019, Lambert was in a relationship with model Javi Costa Polo.[430]\n\nLambert got his first tattoo at 27, just before the start of American Idol.
