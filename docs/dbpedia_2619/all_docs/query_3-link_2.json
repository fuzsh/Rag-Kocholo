        "text": "Does she have any other pop/popish/non-country songs other than Can't Fight the Moonlight? I love her beautiful rich voice, but unfortunately country is not exactly my cup of tea so I'd like to find some songs that'll turn me into a fan and maybe her country stuff will eventually grow on me. Any suggestions?\n\nHer albums \"Twisted Angel\" \"Whatever We Wanna\" and \"Remnants\" are definitely her most pop/least country sounding albums. There are also of course the other songs from the Coyote Ugly soundtrack, and her song \"I Need You\" which was released a few months prior to \"Can't Find The Moonlight\" and was her first 'pop' single.\n\nShe's also had some great remixes of some of her country songs, specifically \"What I Cannot Change\" and \"Spitfire.\" She put out a remix album called \"Dance Like You Don't Give A...\" a few years ago.\n\nHere are a few of her poppiest moments:\n\nI loved all of the linked songs (especially \"The Right Kind of Wrong\" and \"Headphones\" the radio edit, but really I love them all and they'll be added to my playlist)! Currently listening to \"Remnants\" and I plan on listening to the other two afterwards. I'd also like to check out the remix album \"What I Cannot Change (Kaskade Remix)\" and \"Spitfire (Stand Tall Fists Up)\" are from. But my oh my her voice is so heavenly I'm kind of sad she's never made it big. What a shame... Anyway, thanks everyone!\n\nBut my oh my her voice is so heavenly I'm kind of sad she's never made it big.\n\nSpeaking as an American millennial, reading this sentence blew my mind a little. She was a massive, massive star over here in the mid-90s through at least halfway into the 2000s; as far as I can tell, the combination of her commercial success floundering in 2007ish and her affair with Eddie Cibrian eclipsing her music in the press put her in a strange purgatory-like position in terms of her career, which is sad. I hope her stint on The Masked Singer was able to remind people of how immensely talented she is.\n\nOh, I wouldn't have guessed that. I thought she was like a one hit wonder with \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" and some other moderate country hits under her belt (I mean, you can't really tell judging by the stats of her singles on Wikipedia that she was that big). But she's never done a full crossover to mainstream à la Taylor Swift, right?\n\nBy the way, I've got \"Twisted Angel\" on repeat these last few days. The singles and these songs are the highlights for me. On top of that, I can't get enough of \"Love Is Love Is Love\". Such an earworm – je valide.\n\nOh, I wouldn't have guessed that. I thought she was like a one hit wonder with \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\" and some other moderate country hits under her belt (I mean, you can't really tell judging by the stats of her singles on Wikipedia that she was that big). But she's never done a full crossover to mainstream à la Taylor Swift, right?\n\nOh, How Do I Live is probably her biggest hit in the US - it set a record for the most weeks on the Hot 100 at the time (69 weeks) and the most weeks in the top five of the Hot 100 (25 weeks).\n\nTwisted Angel was the big shift from country to pop following the success of Coyote Ugly - and it kind of derailed her career in the US, where she was known as a country artist. She hasn't had a top 40 hit there since then, and that probably drove the decision to release the more country-oriented This Woman as her next album but releasing the more rock-oriented follow-up, Whatever We Wanna, only outside the US (as when the album was ready for release there she was still riding high on the country charts with Something's Gotta Give from This Woman).\n\nThis compilation, from 2004, gives a pretty good summary of her more pop-leaning material up to that point:\n\nA remix album to accompany that compilation was also released."
