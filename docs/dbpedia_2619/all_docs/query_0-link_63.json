        "text": "There were some surprises during The Masked Singer season 4 finale, but the Sun winning was not one of them. She's been blowing the judges (and fans) away since the beginning. It was also no surprise, then, that the person under the mask was also a Grammy-award winner. With a voice like that, she better have been. Even the Sun's identity really wasn't that shocking. Most astute fans had been guessing the correct person for weeks — and judges Nicole Scherzinger and Jenny McCarthy caught on as well.\n\nThe Sun's final song, \"The Story\" by Brandi Carlile, clinched her victory. It brought the judges to tears, no less. The series officially has a new winner, and a lot of fans have the satisfaction of knowing they were right.\n\nWho was the Sun on The Masked Singer?\n\nWhen the winner's mask was removed, Grammy-winning singer LeAnn Rimes was standing on the stage. \"This has been an overwhelming experience,\" she said when she was unmasked. \"I didn't expect this to be this much work,\" she added with a laugh. But even though it was a lot of work, she said she had a \"blast\" performing, and that it reminded her why she wanted to be a singer in the first place: \"To give and receive love.\"\n\nTo anyone who didn't guess Rimes — ahem, looking at you Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong — the clues were staring viewers in the face the whole time. Sure, some fans may have thought Demi Lovato or Christina Aguilera was under the mask — but in the end, all the hints added up to Rimes.\n\nThe country singer was not a guess during the first round of performances, but she quickly became a popular Twitter guess on Oct. 7. Rimes was a child star, as the clues suggested, whose parents divorced early in her life. But the Sun's fractured home could also be a reference to Rimes' legal battles with her father. According to ABC, Rimes filed a suit against her father in 2000, claiming her father pocketed some $7 million earnings. Though the two have since settled the matter, that likely caused tension.\n\nThe Oct. 7 pre-performance package also made reference to the Sun \"burning ugly rumors.\" Rimes has been the subject of many rumors over the years: between her affair with now-husband Eddie Cibriani and mumblings of an eating disorder, Rimes is no stranger to headlines. From the Nov. 11 clues, the angel wind chimes were a nod to Rimes' song \"On the Side of Angels.\" She also has a song called \"Cattle Call,\" which is why the cow clue was there.\n\nFinally on Dec. 2, Nicole Scherzinger guessed Rimes, pointing out the \"blue\" clues. They were a reference to Rimes' album Blue. She also has an album called Spitfire, which could explained the fire breathing clue. Plus, Nicole Scherzinger said she'd met Rimes in the bathroom before, so Rimes fit that very specific hint.\n\nDon't feel too bad if you didn't guess the Sun's identity correctly, though. If you didn't guess Bjork, you're already way ahead of Ken."
