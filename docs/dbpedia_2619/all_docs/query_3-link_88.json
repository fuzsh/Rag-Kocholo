It's definitely more in her pop style though.\n\nPost by benmcd2000 on\n\nIs this a cover? I couldn't agree with you more...this is my personal favorite song from the soundtrack. (even a little more then the Joss Stone track) This is one of those tracks that you really believe the singer is feeling the lyric. LeAnn's vocal is convincing and moving. Regardless of what genre of music she sings, no one can deny that LeAnn Rimes is one of the great female vocalist in the music business today!!\n\nPost by Journey on\n\nNo, this isn't a cover. It was a brand new song.\n\nI love this song. Flawless.\n\nI'm still curious if this will appear on the European album but who knows."
