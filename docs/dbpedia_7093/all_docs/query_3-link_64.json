We’re gonna dance some more! And then we’ll go full on Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds! That’s right, it’s the Three Caballeros!\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, The Three Caballeros is a sequel to Saludos Amigos. It was born of the same Goodwill Tour that I wrote at length about in Saludos Amigos. Two of the shorts in Three Caballeros were actually written for Saludos Amigos, cut out, and included again in here. And of course, it has the same goal: educating American audiences about their South American neighbors. For this reason, I’m not going to spend too much time on the background of this film.\n\nOne thing I do want to note, though, is a minor milestone for the studio. Other than a very brief moment in Fantasia, this film was the first full-length feature to combine animation and live action. The live actors dance in front of a screen that has the animated elements projected onto it, which is a simple enough effect. It doesn’t hold up that well, but it paved the way for films like Mary Poppins and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nWhen The Three Caballeros premiered in Mexico City, it was a smash hit. Finally, a Disney film turned an actual profit! Critical reviews were more mixed. Some admired the great technical panache the animators put into the film, while others thought it was a definite case of style over substance. Still others were put off by Donald’s constant skirt-chasing, finding it too risqué for such an innocent-seeming film.\n\nHonestly, I can kind of see their point. It doesn’t bother me, per se, but I do find myself wondering how this got past the Hays Office. Even weirder, Daisy Duck had premiered five years before Three Caballeros, meaning he’s being all girl crazy while definitely attached. We can only hope she didn’t find out about her boyfriend’s shenanigans in Mexico!\n\nAs previously mentioned, Three Caballeros is broken down into a series of shorts. They flow much better here than in Saludos Amigos and boast an actual framing device. Still, I think it’ll be easier to review this one like the other package films. This is mainly because the first two shorts have little to do with the other five or the framing device. If it weren’t for them, there’d be an actual story here. A thin one, but a story nonetheless. However, as it stands, this is what we got.\n\nINTRO/THE COLD BLOODED PENGUIN\n\nThe lights go up on a massive box wrapped in paper. Donald checks the tag, which names the box as presents from his friends in Latin America. Weirdly, his birthday is given as Friday the 13th which A) is not an actual birthdate and B) contradicts his official canon birthday, which is June 9. Man, I don’t know. Friday the 13th still definitely suits this unlucky duck.\n\nDonald’s first present is a film projector that comes with home movies. There’s one of many overly long gags where Donald struggles to get the thing set up. After he gets stuck in the screen and gets the projection off his butt, he settles in to watch a movie about South American birds. Fred Shields is back as the narrator… for a little while. Once he’s moved down to the tip of Argentina, he hands over narrating duties to none other than Sterling Holloway!\n\n“Professor Holloway” introduces us to Antarctica and the penguins that live and play there. Last I checked Antarctica wasn’t part of South America but the penguins are cute so whatever. One of the penguins is named Pablo, and he just can’t seem to get warm enough even with the help of his stove, Smokey Joe. He makes a plan to leave Antarctica and sail north to the Galapagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador. From there we follow his journey and the shenanigans he gets into on the way. After a harrowing moment where the hot sun melts his ice floe boat, he finally makes it… only to find that he’s homesick!\n\nI actually really liked this short! There are some really great visual gags throughout, like the “blanket of fog so thick you can cut with a knife”, where Pablo does exactly that. Holloway also gets off some fantastically dry line deliveries in that sweet, sincere way that he’s famous for. And unlike the Pedro short it so resembles, The Cold-Blooded Penguin actually has some educational value! There really are penguins in the Galapagos Islands, and mentions are made of several real cities like Quito and Lima. It may not have much to do with the overall “plot” but it’s still a lot of fun. You really can’t go wrong with penguins.\n\nAVES RARAS\n\nWe leave Pablo behind with a clever little camera trick that makes it seem like we’re really hopping over the Andes Mountains. Fred Shields then takes it upon himself to introduce Donald to several of the unique avian residents of South America. We get to see an arapapa get his majestic flowing hair (?) cut by la tijereta, or the scissorbird, much to his chagrin. Donald offends an arapacu de pico curvo by laughing at his ludicrously large, curved beak. Shields gets uncomfortably interested in the mating habits of toucans. And then the hero of the movie arrives!\n\nWe’re introduced to the Aracuan, a manic bundle of energy with the catchiest little bird call ever. It seems like most people find his madcap antics annoying, and I get it. He exists mainly to troll everyone else and he won’t stop screaming. But y’all. I love this guy. So much. He’s a riot, and I wish he was in more stuff. He’s one of my favorite Disney characters, not just my favorite character in this movie. He’s an absolute delight.\n\nIt’s not really a song so I don’t feel right talking about it, but listen to his call. It’s so fun.\n\nShields soldiers on trying to be educational. He shows off a marrequito building its nest out of carefully placed sticks. It looks kind of like a Jenga tower, and if one single twig is out of place the whole thing will tumble down. So, naturally, the Aracuan drops a stick on top of it and ruins it. Because he is a troll. And I adore him.\n\nThere’s also a gag where we’re introduced to the flamingo. This section is weird to me because I always thought flamingos only occurred naturally in Africa (yes, despite living in Florida). Google says otherwise. Look, I’m learning! Anyway, Donald tries his best to stand like a flamingo and ends up failing repeatedly and it goes on way too long.\n\nOur last strange bird takes us to Uruguay, where we again switch narrators. It’s the ornero, whose nest looks like an oven. Then the old gaucho offers to tell us a story of the strangest bird of all…..\n\nTHE FLYING GAUCHITO\n\nOur narrator introduces us to his younger self and his morning routine. The movie repeats the items of a gaucho’s clothing that we saw earlier in Saludos Amigos. It makes it very clear that this short was actually intended for that movie, before it was replaced with El Gaucho Goofy. This one was nearly finished, though, so they stuck it in here. And more on that later.\n\nOnce he’s ready, the gauchito embarks on a condor hunt. There’s a pretty funny moment where our narrator establishes himself as unreliable. He can’t remember if his younger self should be sitting on a rock or a tree. The younger version gets more and more annoyed as his perch keeps changing back and forth. Finally, the narrator gives up trying to remember and moves on.\n\nThe gauchito looks around the mountains and finds a giant nest. He goes after the giant condor wings sticking up out of it and finds… a flying donkey! And it’s much cuter than the Pinocchio donkeys! After a wild rodeo ride across the sky, the gauchito tames the donkey and names it Burrito.\n\nThe gauchito comes up with a plan to use his new friend to make a ton of money. He takes him to the square on Fiesta Day and enters him into a race for 1000 pesos in prize money. This only converts into like ten dollars and he’d probably be better served just selling the flying donkey because flying donkey but hey I didn’t write the thing. At first, the gauchito lags way, way behind because he’s riding a donkey against the top horse racers of Uruguay. But then, at his older self’s urging, he lets loose Burrito’s wings and zooms past the competition.\n\nWhen the gauchito receives his prize money, the racers see Burrito flying. They immediately know they’ve been cheated and start baying for blood. Burrito takes to the sky with the gauchito clinging to his reigns. The short ends with an amusing bit of situational irony where the narrator states that neither he or his donkey friend were ever seen again. Yet here he is recording a voiceover!\n\nAll in all, I like this short, though perhaps not as much as The Cold-Blooded Penguin. It’s fine on its own merits, with a tight narrative and some very funny moments. Plus, the donkey is just adorable and I want fifteen. That said, I definitely don’t think it has any business being in this movie. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the bird theme that’s present in this one, though it does showcase South American culture in its way. I feel like it would have worked just fine in Saludos Amigos, probably even better than its eventual replacement.\n\nBAIA\n\nDonald’s next present glows, dances, and plays a catchy little samba beat. And where there’s samba, there’s José! He pops up in a book about Brazil playing his cigar like a flute and his umbrella like a guitar. In a nice callback to his last appearance, he babbles on and on in Portuguese, only to translate to the much simpler English “what’s cookin’?” It’s kind of adorable.\n\nApropos of nothing, he asks Donald if he’s been to Baia, and starts to wax poetic about the city. I say starts, because he doesn’t get far before the Aracuan returns to be adorable and steal his cigar. He lets loose a stream of irritated Portuguese. And then he has the nerve to call my crazy lil nutjob an idiot bird! How rude!\n\nJose then apologizes for the interruption and asks again if Donald has been to Baia. As he’s gushing again about the beauty of the city, we transition into the most visually appealing part of the movie.\n\nThe combination of the lovely song and the absolutely exquisite animation makes me actually want to visit Baia. The multiplane camera is in full force here, as is some great work with colors. There are some shots of sparkling water and dewdrops on flowers that wouldn’t be out of place in Fantasia! I know I’ve said that about a couple sequences but it’s particularly impressive for these package films. They were made on the cheap so the best parts of them really, really stand out.\n\nThe scene fades out, and we return to José’s silhouette eerily outlined in pink and blue. Seriously, it looks like something out of a horror movie. And his next ominous line, “if you go to Baia, my friend, you never return!” doesn’t help. I don’t know why this movie makes José such a creeper, man, I really don’t.\n\nAfter scaring the children, José asks Donald about four hundred more times if he’s been to Baia. This results in a catchy little number that’s more or less the same message as the previous one, but much more upbeat. José also dresses in drag and splits into four copies of himself. Because sure. And this is far, far from the weirdest part of this movie. José smacks Donald over the head with a giant mallet to shrink him to his size. Donald finally gets fed up with the madness (oh honey) and asks if José’s ever been to Baia. And wouldn’t you know it… he hasn’t!\n\nThey hop onto a train that just SCREAMS “Mary Blair worked on this” and off we go! En route, though, the Aracuan makes his last appearance. Because some birds just want to watch the world burn, he draws several more sets of train tracks and makes the whole train fly apart. It comes back together but by the time it reaches the station in Baia, it’s completely crashed.\n\nBut we made it, so let’s party! José turns the page and we see our first live-action segment featuring the beautiful Aurora Miranda, sister to Carmen Miranda. Her character is introduced as Yaya and José gets SUPER excited because “she sells COOKIES! COOKIES, my friend!” It’s totally not a euphemism.\n\nOh, wait, no, Donald goes into a frenzy the second he lays eyes on Yaya’s… ahem… cookies. José tries to hold him back but as we soon see, Donald’s libido in this movie just can’t be tamed. As cool as the integration of animation of live-action and animation are, the resulting dance sequence goes on way too long. Donald flirts a lot with Yaya and gets homicidally angry when human men do the same.\n\nFinally, a bunch more live-action ladies show up and take the attention off of Yaya, much to her annoyance. But it’s okay because Donald stuck around, and he’s got a bouquet! She lays a big old kiss on Donald’s lips and… man, I don’t even know what happens next. It’s the first of several pants-on-head crazy sequences in this film. Bright colors bloom on a black background. Human dancers turn into roosters and back for a weird cross between West Side Story and a cockfight. Lampposts start dancing. The whole city starts dancing, buildings and all. I don’t even know. And this is still not the weirdest segment of this film.\n\nJosé drags Donald out of the Brazil book and into whatever the weird liminal space is that houses the framing sections. Donald is still acting drunk on love and visibly freaking José out. José slaps him to snap him out of it, calls him a “wolf” (not how I’d put that) and suggests he opens his last present. But Donald shrank earlier and he can’t reach the top of the box. So what solution does José come up with?\n\nBLACK. MAGIC.\n\nI knew there was something shady about this guy. He does another catchy little samba number that’s supposed to be an incantation and blows on his thumb to inflate himself. Naturally, when Donald tries, he messes it all up and kicks off some more surrealism. José cracks up through the whole thing instead of helping for a very long time until finally pointing out that Donald is blowing into his index finger, not his thumb. Donald gets the hang of it and goes to his third and final present….\n\nMEXICO\n\nWHICH EXPLODES. A LOT.\n\nThere’s a short sequence reminiscent of the soundtrack in Fantasia where a sound wave turns into several instruments and sucks Donald into it. And then there’s another explosion and a loud grito. Out of the flames, our third Caballero leaps onto the scene, screaming like a lunatic and firing his guns everywhere. I’m not sure this is the best introduction to Mexico, but Panchito’s still a really fun character. He’s just a little ball of manic energy, the same reason I love the Aracuan.\n\nPanchito races over to the other two and clones his sombrero to give to Jose and Donald. And then they sing the iconic Three Caballeros theme song. More on that later, but a large part of this Best Friends song consists of Donald getting threatened, José being terrified, and the other two attempting to murder Panchito. Seriously, during the long last note, they attempt to set him on fire, poison him, cut the floor out from under him to get him to shut up!\n\nPanchito survives and summons a piñata from the ether. And this part’s kind of weird to me. Piñatas are such a big part of American celebrations nowadays that Donald not knowing what it is is just like… what? Maybe they hadn’t become a thing here yet. Anyway, Panchito explains that the piñata is used as part of a Mexican Christmas tradition called Las Posadas.\n\nWe transition into a beautiful, short little sequence that’s even more Mary Blair than the train. Everything but the flames of the characters’ candles is done in still illustrations that give the sequence a sense of melancholy. It’s truly gorgeous, and it’s a real shame it doesn’t go on for longer.\n\nPanchito explains that Mexican children form a procession that represents the journey of Mary and Joseph. Each night for nine nights, they go house to house asking for shelter and are refused. Finally, one house opens up and everyone parties! The children break open a piñata that’s full of toys and treats.\n\nDonald is always here to beat things up, so he goes to take his turn at the piñata. Panchito blindfolds him and urges him to whack it. And while poor Donald spins around trying to hit the thing, José and Panchito keep yanking it away like Charlie Brown’s football. Finally, they stop being trolls and let Donald hit the thing. It explodes (like everything else in this movie) in a shower of confetti, instruments, books, and more piñatas. Oh, and an angry bull made out of fireworks.\n\nPanchito opens a book on Mexico that fell out of the piñata. He treats us to a little history lesson about the Mexican flag. It’s educational and entertaining but it’s so short it barely qualifies as a segment. He then ushers his friends onto the magic serape which is apparently a thing. Because sure.\n\nThe following sequence, a magic serape ride through Pátzcuaro, Veracruz, and Acapulco, is one of the most famous parts of the entire movie. This is mostly because it became the basis of a whole ride in Epcot (more on that later), but the integration of live action and animation is much more impressive here than the last time we saw it.\n\nThis is also where the movie feels much more like a sequel to Saludos Amigos. It makes a point of showing off Mexico City to show, once again, that our neighbors to the south are just as cosmopolitan as we are. In Pátzcuaro and Veracruz, we’re treated to some of the local dances, just as we were in the previous film. Once again, the sequence just goes on and on and nothing is happening and it’s fun for a little bit but it goes on far too long. It also heralds the return of Donald the pervert which is excruciatingly uncomfortable and includes the line “Some fun, eh, kid?” which will haunt my nightmares forever.\n\nOur final stop on the magic serape tour is Acapulco Beach, which isn’t really Acapulco Beach but the parking lot of the Disney studio and you can totally tell by the giant wall in the background (insert Trump joke here). All the pervy Donald stuff REALLY comes to a head here, and the other two really aren’t much better.\n\nThe scene opens with Panchito handing Donald a telescope so he can look at the “hot stuff”. The second Donald sees his first bikini-clad girl, the telescope gets longer and stiffer and starts vibrating in a very clear metaphor that I am in no way reading too far into. And then the serape dive bombs the beach, complete with honest-to-god machine gun noises from the Caballeros. The girls scream and run terrified from the amorous avians and it only gets worse from there.\n\nDonald lands and immediately starts creeping on every woman he lays eyes on. They toss him up and down in blanket, which is actually an impressive effect. The blanket dips just like there’s a real weight in it, a feat that wouldn’t really be repeated until Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988! There’s no time to be impressed, though. Donald starts a game of Blind Man’s Bluff, where he runs around trying to get a kiss from Literally. Anyone. Including, apparently, José.\n\nJosé and Panchito yank Donald onto the serape despite the duck’s protests. Panchito laughs “so you like purdy girls, huh?” And it’s like, “well duh!” It’s absolutely painful because dude Donald is a lech that’s not even funny. The little rooster then offers to show Donald and José the nightlife of Mexico City, which sounds great in theory.\n\nYOU BELONG TO MY HEART/DONALD’S SURREAL REVERIE\n\nHowever, in practice, we never actually go to Mexico City. Instead, Dora Luz’s face pops up in the sky and starts singing a ballad. This comes out of absolutely nowhere. But Donald is absolutely smitten. Her disembodied lips multiply and peck Donald on the cheek. And then things get absolutely balls-to-the-wall insane.\n\nSeriously, the end of this movie might be the strangest thing I’ve ever seen on film ever. There is no doing it justice with words. Donald is a hummingbird, there’s Busby Berkley choreography, there’s dancing cacti, the Caballeros turn into a horse thing with human legs…. yeah. It’s something you just have to experience. So here. If I have to see this, so do you.\n\nThe movie ends with the return of the fireworks bull thing that came out of the piñata. Donald is trapped inside while Panchito goads it with a red cloth that becomes a skirt at one point for no apparent reason. José lights the fireworks on its back with his cigar, then shoves more fireworks straight up Donald’s butt (no, seriously). And then… that’s it. The movie just ends like that. There’s a nice little touch with “The End” appearing in Spanish, Portuguese, and finally English in the colors of each country’s flag. But I’m really just too mentally exhausted after that madness to appreciate it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Three Caballeros has some really good moments. I love each of the Caballeros individually, and any time you get to see the dynamic between them is a lot of fun (weird sexual stuff notwithstanding). Both of the shorts at the beginning are enjoyable, too, if a little out of place. But while I understand that surrealism was really popular in the 40s, what I look for in a feature is a story and characters. This film starts to give us that and succeeds in giving us great characters, and then comes to a screeching halt to get weird.\n\nBut enough about my disappointment. Let’s talk about where this movie shines!\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nOkay, so we all know Donald. But his characterization is pretty unusual here. He really only loses his temper once in the entire movie. It almost feels like having his friends around mellows him out. Either that, or all that famous anger has been replaced by an extreme thirst for the ladies. I have no idea where that came from and it’s never been part of his characterization again. But it is weird and uncomfortable and I do not like it.\n\nJosé, however, is even cooler than his previous appearance in Saludos Amigos, though this may be due to his increased screentime. I know I ragged on him for being creepy because of the black magic thing but all joking aside, I think that headcanon makes him even cooler. He’s like the suave, levelheaded one of the group… even if sometimes he can act like an enabler and intentionally gets his friends into trouble.\n\nIf José is the levelheaded one, Panchito is the fireball. This guy is pure energy, let loose through his rapid-fire guns and rapid-fire talking. He’s a blast to watch, no pun intended, but he knows when to dial it back. The Las Posadas and Mexican flag sections are surprisingly low-key given his manic introduction. But that hyperactivity is nothing compared to the unofficial fourth Caballero….\n\nOkay, not really. But I love this little guy so much and I had to include him here. He’s just a living whirlwind, freaking out and causing chaos everywhere he goes. He’s the avian embodiment of the troll face. And he’s adorable to boot! I can see why people find him annoying, but everything that irritates other people just endears him to me. I. Love. The. Aracuan.\n\nKind of off topic but if you want more Aracuan antics, check out the Donald cartoon Clown of the Jungle. It’s six minutes of the Aracuan being fantastic, though the suicide references are a little bit uncomfortable. He still sings the song, though, and he’s still really cute.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nFor the most part, The Three Caballeros is similar quality to a particularly good TV series. The two notable exceptions are Baía in a good way and You Belong to My Heart in a not as good way. Baía is all gorgeous watercolors and brilliant hues, with smooth animation and dazzling special effects. You Belong to My Heart is… something. It’s something.\n\nThe parts where they combine live action with animation are really cool, too. The effects Os Quindins de Yaya haven’t aged particularly well, but the Acapulco Beach segment has. It’s really impressive to think they managed to make it look like these women are really interacting with Donald, right down to his weight in the blanket. Just because that interaction is really creepy doesn’t make the technical aspect less impressive for its time.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThe Three Caballeros (Chorus version) is a pretty generic Disney credits song by the pretty generic Disney chorus. It does a decent enough job setting the stage for the film to come, though it’s not quite as memorable as the main version of the song. I do like it a lot more than Saludos Amigos, though.\n\nThe melody of the song is actually from a Mexican song called Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes, from a 1941 film of the same name. Walt heard the song from the original movie and loved it. He called Manuel Esperón, the composer personally to ask him to use the song, and Esperón obviously agreed. Ray Gilbert wrote new English lyrics for this and all of the other translated songs in the film.\n\nBaía is honestly a little boring. The visuals are fantastic, but the music is very dated. I know this is a travelogue, but it feels like something out of a cheesy commercial. It’s still one of the better sequences in the film, the song’s just kind of boring. This one’s based on a song called Na Baixa do Sapateiro, which translates to In the Shoemaker’s Hollow. And I’m really not sure how we went from shoemakers to Baíha but sure. The original song was written by Ary Barroso, who also did the much better Aquarela do Brasil in Saludos Amigos.\n\nHave You Been to Bahia? is much better. It’s got a fun samba beat that makes Baía sound way more appealing. Being sung by José certainly helps! My only complaint about this one is that it’s too short. And that’s a good problem to have! This one was written by Dorival Caymmi and translated almost word for word. The only real change they made was turning a racial slur into Donald’s name. And honestly, good call.\n\nOs Quindins de Yayá is another good one. There are some really great drumbeats here, and some nice vocals from Aurora Miranda. It’s a lot of fun, though I don’t really think it needed to be seven minutes long. This one was also written by Barroso and not translated at all. The slower section sung by the malandrodor is actually an entirely different song, Pregões Caricoas by Braguinha. The transition is pretty seamless and I wouldn’t have known they were different songs without Wikipedia.\n\nThe Three Caballeros is easily the best song in the movie, and the best known. The lyrics are witty and the tune is bouncy and it’s just an all around good time. Both the visuals and the song itself are gag after gag, but unlike certain later scenes I could mention, it totally works here. It’s like a party for your eardrums!\n\nMexico is the only completely original song in the movie. Unfortunately, as it serves the same purpose as Baía, it suffers from the exact same problem. It’s boring. I mean, it’s mind-numbingly boring. The nicest thing I can say about this one is that it’s short.\n\nYou Belong to My Heart may be part of an absolutely terrifying sequence, but it’s actually a nice song. It’s a lot more dynamic than the other two ballads, and her voice is pleasant to listen to even if it’s still got that 40’s quality to it. This one was originally called Solamente una vez (Only One Time) by Agustín Lara. It has absolutely nothing to do with the original lyrics, but it proved extremely popular following the film’s release. It was covered by artists like Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, and Gene Autry, making it even more famous. Even Disney reused it for the short Pluto’s Blue Note.\n\nTHEME PARK INFLUENCE\n\nphoto credit\n\nEven though this movie’s pretty obscure, the Caballeros have a fairly large theme park presence. The biggest one is the Gran Fiesta Tour ride in Epcot’s Mexico pavilion, which overlaid the original boat ride with the story of Donald running amok through different Mexican locales (fortunately without the creepiness). José and Panchito search and search for him and finally get him back in time for their concert in Mexico City. As of 2015, the ride ends with three animatronics of the Caballeros singing their theme song. Those animatronics actually come from the Mickey Mouse Revue, an extinct attraction from Magic Kingdom and later Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nCoronado Springs Resort also features a lot of decór honoring the Caballeros. Their likenesses appear in the rooms and in the lobby, and in topiary form in one of the courtyards. The gift shop is called Panchitos, and even features a statue of Burrito! It’s not the only resort that features them, though. The Calypso pool at All Star Music features a statue of the three that shoots water out of Panchito’s guns.\n\nphoto credit\n\nThe Caballeros make some smaller appearances throughout Walt Disney World as well. They have a poster in the queue for Mickey’s Philharmagic. Mickey’s Very Merry Christmas Party features the Mickey’s Most Merriest Celebration stage show which is mostly unwatchable but their rendition of Feliz Navidad is a lot of fun. And up until recently, guests could dance with José and Panchito in Discovery Island Carnivale at Disney’s Animal Kingdom.\n\nWalt Disney World isn’t the only park that includes the Caballeros, though it’s the one where they make the most appearances. They appeared in Disneyland California’s Soundsational parade and in the Christmas version of World of Color, again singing Feliz Navidad. California and Hong Kong’s versions of It’s a Small World have animatronics of the Caballeros in the Mexico room. Disneyland Paris has them show up in their Halloween show Goofy’s Skeletoon Street Party and in the more recent Max Live!. In Tokyo, they’re very popular meet and greet characters and show up in their show Let’s Party Gras.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWhen Three Caballeros is good, it’s really good. It’s funny. It’s got great characters. It does a much better job than Saludos Amigos of showing Latin American locales. But when it’s bad, it’s super cringey. Donald is downright creepy, and then there are the random acid sequences that pepper the middle and end. It’s like the movie tries to have a plot, but just completely forgets at points.\n\nFavorite scene: The first appearance of my precious little Aracuan bird. His little song is so catchy and I think I’m going to make it my ringtone."
