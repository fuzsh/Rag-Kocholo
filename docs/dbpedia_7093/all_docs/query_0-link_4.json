        "text": "There's something inherently deceptive about chance encounters, not in terms of honesty really but more-so in how we come to perceive their significance. By definition, these encounters at their onset are slight in nature: meeting someone for the first time hardly has any significance as it happens all the time, there's no particular reason why one would think any specific person would mean more than the next. It's upon reflection that we really understand how important they are to us, how serendipitous our first encounter with them was. There's too many people in my life that mean too much to me that, when I think of how arbitrary it was that we met, makes me suddenly thankful for whatever powers…\n\nLovers have never been so lonely as they are in the New York City of Vincente Minnelli’s “The Clock.”\n\nIn the midst of a city of millions, Judy Garland, a single secretary, and Robert Walker, a solitary soldier, collide on the steps of Grand Central Station. So begins Minnelli’s early career romance, “The Clock,” which, from the sparsely populated opening credits, promises scant few supporting players in its orbit, beyond its central star crossed couple.\n\nDifferent from many later ‘one night romance’ films, notably the “Before” series, the New York of “The Clock” does not serendipitously unfold for its lovers. Its side characters serve by and large to obstruct the enchantment of the pair, not enable their magic. They are:…\n\n\"I guess I don't feel very married.\"\n\nOn a two-day leave in wartime Manhattan, bumpkin GI Joe (Robert Walker) takes one look at the imposing skyline and retreats to the cavernous confines of Penn Station, whereupon he inadvertently destroys the footwear of Alice (Judy Garland)—a lonesome secretary who might have wandered in from an Edward Hopper canvas—before improbably winning her heart with a bottomless supply of homespun prattle.\n\nThe Clock came about when Garland—thoroughly tired of her exclusive diet of musicals—exhorted producer Arthur Freed to find a straight dramatic role to demonstrate her acting capacity. While the screenplay is certainly nothing special, it somehow represents the meeting of four minds (dialogue by Robert Nathan and Joseph Schrank from a story…\n\nTwo strangers meet by chance in a crowded station: a soldier just about to be shipped off to Europe and the girl he soon falls for, both in their different ways far from home in the hustle and bustle of New York. Their brief romance unfolds against the backdrop of The City That Never Sleeps, but time is progressively ticking away; war looms in the background of the endearing love story, providing extra poignancy to this look at how with one encounter fate can throw two completely different people together.\n\nWhile not a musical, director Vincente Minnelli heightens each scene so that, like his earlier MGM projects with producer Arthur Freed, the emotions of the characters become externalised.
