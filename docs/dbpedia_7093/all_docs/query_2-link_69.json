        "text": "In 1956, Bill Haley’s film Rock Around the Clock hit Britain. The film was released in England, Scotland and Wales, being shown in places like Newport, Cardiff and Swansea. It symbolised the beginnings of the phenomenon of teenage culture, as audiences vandalised cinemas and acted in other violent ways. These actions caught the attention of the media, which helped spread the outbreak in teenage violence from London to Cardiff and the rest of Britain.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nWho was Bill Haley?\n\nBill Haley was an American rock ‘n’ roll musician who topped the charts with his songs ‘Shake, Rattle and Roll’ (1954) and ‘Rock Around the Clock’ (1956). Despite being a ‘teenage icon’, at the height of his fame Haley was in his thirties. His impact on youth culture in the fifties was soon forgotten by the emergence of the younger and more alluring Elvis Presley.[1] Nonetheless, Haley’s Rock Around the Clock was the catalyst for the rock ‘n’ roll craze that was sweeping Britain and causing popular concern.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe impact of Rock Around the Clock\n\nHistorian Dominic Sandbrook argues that because of the association between the music and racial equality and sexual freedom, the older generation were worried that the music represented the disappearance of traditional values.[2]\n\nHowever, it was the ‘violence’ that was the biggest concern. On 17 September 1956, The Times newspaper said that ‘since the beginning of September more than 60 youths have appeared in police courts charged with taking part in disturbances inside cinemas or on the streets outside cinemas where the film was shown.’ The ‘disturbances’ ranged from what can be considered harmless teenage excitement like jiving on the cinema seats, and clapping and shouting during the film, to the more extreme acts of violence like slashing cinema seats with knives.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe attention to these reactions to Rock Around the Clock in the media created what some historians call ‘ritualistic behaviour’ as teenagers across Britain copied this behaviour when the film was shown in their local cinema.\n\nThis caused a panic among the older generation, and a general concern about the impact that rock ‘n’ roll had on their teenagers. The London Evening News called upon a family doctor to offer readers a medical explanation for these acts of violence. The doctor stated that the cause was mental illness, suggesting that to tackle these crimes teenagers would need to be put in rehabilitation or a psychopathic institution. Historian Jonathon Green argues that this assessment is over exaggerated, and that doctors who offered their ‘expertise’ to these newspapers were not qualified to make such assessments.[3]\n\nWhat happened in Wales?\n\nSimilar to the rest of Britain, Rock Around the Clock caused considerable controversy in Wales. When the film was shown in Newport, the audience carried out the same violent ‘ritualistic’ behaviour that was reported in The Times, slashing seats with pocket knives and tearing fire extinguishers off the walls. This extreme behaviour caused local authorities to ban the film elsewhere. This was backed up by a local paper who agreed that they had done the right thing.[4]\n\nThere were reports of violent behaviour in Cardiff, similar to the London Evening News. A family doctor told the South Wales Echo about the violent behaviour that took place during the screening of the film. He detailed how the teenagers shouted during the film, and stood on the seats to jive to the music. The doctor said ‘this was symptomatic of youth the world over in a ‘neurotic age’, with its easy money, poor discipline, misguided education and lax morals.’[6] Despite this behaviour taking place in Newport and Cardiff, on 25 September 1956 the South Wales Evening Post reported that no riots took place in Swansea caused by the screening of Rock Around the Clock.\n\nThe fact that the South Wales Evening Post reported no violent behaviour in Swansea following the screening of the film shows that despite media hype, not all teenagers copied this ‘ritualistic behaviour’. However, the newspaper doesn’t detail anything else about the screening of Rock Around the Clock so it could be that teenagers were clapping, and hissing, as well as jiving on the seats and in the aisles. So whereas media attention had made a major impact on worrying older generations, the reality of the violent behaviour associated with this film was intermittent as opposed to a countrywide disturbance.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThough Rock Around the Clock didn’t inspire all teenagers to participate in violent behaviour, the rock ‘n’ roll craze itself became a cause for concern. Historian Jon Gower says that for the older generations of Welsh people who were used to traditional hymns sang in Welsh, rock ‘n’ roll was the ‘devil’s own music’, and, it was sang in English.[5] In the 1950s the ‘traditional Welsh way of life’ was already being challenged because of more job opportunities that were better paid meaning that consumer goods, like televisions became more affordable and easily available. The rock ‘n’ roll craze was another threat to the disappearance of the ‘traditional Welsh way of life’. A typical Welsh life before the 1950s would traditionally revolve around the chapel. The social life of the chapel, the music and the Sunday service were all a major part of life for small communities, so it is understandable how rock ‘n’ roll had created such a panic in Wales. Everything from the fashion to the music was extremely different from anything else at the time.\n\nThe ‘traditional Welsh way of life’ was also threatened by new factories opening around Wales. These factories brought a surplus of better paid jobs, meaning that teenagers who worked now had disposable income. This enabled the trend of rock ‘n’ roll to grow as teenagers now had money to keep up with the latest fashions and records, as well as being able to go to the cinema more often.\n\nHowever, this also meant that teenagers were also able to afford to drink and go to the pub. This could be seen as a cause of the violent behaviour that was associated with rock ‘n’ roll in this period. For example, the destructive behaviour that took place in cinemas during Rock Around the Clock.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAs well as disposable income, national service was another contributing factor to the hype of the rock ‘n’ roll craze. In the 1950s, national service was compulsory for eighteen year old men. This played into the lack of responsibility that rock ‘n’ roll symbolised. Young men were drafted into the army at eighteen so were they more likely to enjoy their teenage years, rather than settle down, get married and have children like their parents would have done around that age.[7]\n\nThis added to the older generation’s worries, as they saw rock ‘n’ roll as a representation of promiscuity. However, national service also helped to diminish these worries, as it meant that young men would be disciplined by the military by the time they were eighteen. As well as this, the Western Mail published an article in September 1956 exclaiming that Elvis Presley’s hits would be quashed by a ‘new religious theme’ in music by the time he went to the army for national service.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nWhy did this matter?\n\nThe impact of Rock Around the Clock contributed to a whole new age of teenage culture. This continued on through the 1960s with things like Beatlemania and has continued through the 70s, 80s and 90s to modern day.\n\nIn this period, rock ‘n’ roll symbolised modernity, with its fast paced music and bright coloured fashions that were so different from the traditional hymns sang in chapel and ‘Sunday best’ fashion. Historian Jonathon Green describes the 1950s teenage culture as ‘none of which, however garish, however exceptional in a world of baggy, monochrome conformity’.[7]\n\nThe significance of Rock Around the Clock in Britain shows a major shift in sociological history, from the traditionally reserved social culture to a new fast paced way of life. Despite the concerns of violence and promiscuity, the whole rock ‘n’ roll craze has a positive impact on Britain by pushing the country towards a new and modern way of life.\n\nWhat is the significance for Wales?\n\nMuch like the rest of Britain, Rock Around the Clock caused the same outbreak of violence in Wales. The impact of Bill Haley’s film affected the entirety of Britain, as well as the worries of the older generations. However, as seen in the South Wales Evening Post, not all teenagers took to the same ‘ritualistic violent behaviour’ that was reported in places like London.\n\nWales could have possibly been more affected by the impact of this film because of the importance of the chapel in small and rural communities. However, this could also be said for smaller communities in England. This could also be why teenagers in Swansea did not participate in rioting during or after the film was shown. However, the rock ‘n’ roll craze itself was still a cause for concern among the older generation.\n\nSo, the invasion of American rock ‘n’ roll music was not uniquely a Welsh problem, but instead was an issue that concerned the older generations across Britain while also encapsulating the teenagers all across the UK.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n[1] Mitchell, Gillian A.
