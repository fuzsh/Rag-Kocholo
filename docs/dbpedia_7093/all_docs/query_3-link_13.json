        "text": "The Lost Weekend is a 1945 American FILM NOlR drama film directed by Billy Wilder, and starring Ray Milland and Jane Wyman. It was based on Charles R. Jackson's novel of the same name about an alcoholic writer.\n\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It also shared the Grand Prix at the first Cannes Film Festival, making it one of only three films—the other two being Marty (1955) and Parasite (2019)—to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the highest award at Cannes.\n\nIn 2011, The Lost Weekend was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nYou can find out more about this movie from Wikipedia and there is also a good review from Slant magazine. A digital transcript of the original New York Times review, written by legendary film critic Bosley Crowther, may still be available."
