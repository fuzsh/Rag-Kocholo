        "text": "“Now we can make it look like suicide.”\n\nMy Name Is Julia Ross is a nifty little thriller because it places us in the same position as our heroine. Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is hired as secretary to the seemingly innocent Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Whitty). She should have suspected something wasn’t kosher from the beginning since the old lady is accompanied by her son, Ralph, and Ralph is played by the terminally suspicious George Macready. Julia soon discovers that the Hugheses are planning to pass her off as Ralph’s late wife, Marion, and that no one will believe she is who she says she is. Like Julia, we don’t know what’s going on and why and how she’s going…\n\n\"People can think themselves into anything\"\n\nBehind in the rent and in desperate need for cash, Julia Ross takes a job as a personal secretary for an strange older woman through a sketchy agency. Upon arrival she falls asleep and wakes up in the morning in a strange location with the family insisting she is really Marion Hughes, the wife of the old ladies son Ralph and just doesn't remember because she's had a nervous breakdown. As the situation gets more and more dangerous, she finds herself up against the clock in a race to escape before it's too late.\n\nWhile it can't touch his wonderful film Gun Crazy (1950) which would come half a decade later, Joseph H. Lewis'…\n\n“Why did you bring me here? What are you planning to do with me? Are you trying to drive me crazy, is that it? Tell me what you’re planning to do with me!”\n\nMini-Collab w/ Enrico\n\nNoirvember #6\n\nI have to admire a film that accomplishes everything it needs to in a short and sweet 65 minutes! Gaslighting noir works well at that brisk a pace and Nina Foch sells the story exactly right as the title character, held against her will by the dastardly mother-son duo of Dame May Whitty and (I thought) a particularly handsome George Macready for a nasty murder scheme. There’s no time to develop the villains at all, which is a drawback, and the romance…\n\nthe erasure of julia's identity is a story which has so much resonance today; in a world where the system of the bourgeois family unit is still seen as semi-sacred, a woman's personality can be entirely subsumed into the role she's been tasked with, and any behavior to the contrary can easily be chalked up to mental illness, stress, or good ol' fashioned 'hysteria'. i couldn't help but think of her entrapment in this housewife role as being so similar to the way that trans folk, especially teenagers, are so often treated by their families -- they assert their own identities, only to be shoved back into the false identity that the family has already determined for them, and punished…\n\nA taut and efficient rendition of Gaslight's central premise. The titular character is an isolated and vulnerable young woman who takes a job as a live-in secretary, before waking up in a Cornish mansion where everyone tells her she is the insane wife of the master of the house. The whole mystery is pretty much made clear right off the bat. May Whitty had George Macready are great as the villainous mother and son who are behind what is a plot to cover up a murder. Joseph H. Lewis' film runs at just over an hour. It's not really enough time to get into the plot in any great depth, but the film is exceptionally well paced - with all…"
