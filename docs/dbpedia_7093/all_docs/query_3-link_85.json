        "text": "Having graduated from editor to co-director on Noël Coward’s In Which We Serve (1942), David Lean’s first three solo works as director were all Coward adaptations, culminating in this skilful opening-out of the 1936 play Still Life.\n\nTrapped in a suburban marriage, brittle housewife Laura (Celia Johnson) struggles with her passion for dashing doctor Alec (Trevor Howard). The film’s blend of the middle-class everyday, Robert Krasker’s atmospheric black and white cinematography and Rachmaninoff’s swooning 2nd Piano Concerto remains powerfully affecting. The film quivers with pent-up emotion in a way that must have been even more potent on its release in 1945 – just months after the end of World War II – than it is today.\n\n10 great\n\n10 great films set at train stations\n\nBy Scott Jordan Harris\n\n10 great films set at train stations\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time… in 1952\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time… in 1952\n\n10 great\n\n10 great films about brief encounters\n\nBy David Morrison\n\n10 great films about brief encounters"
