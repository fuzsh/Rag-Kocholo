        "text": "Of all Agatha Christie’s novels, And Then There Were None is the one that has been filmed the most. I must also add that almost every version of it has been mediocre at best, while many were downright awful.\n\nNaturally this raises questions about Christie’s book. What is it that makes And Then There Were None such a popular choice for adaptation? And why do so many moviemakers get it so wrong? To understand this, we need to look at Christie’s original book, and René Clair’s 1945 movie, perhaps the only one version that somehow got it right.\n\nI may as well begin with a quick synopsis of Christie’s original story, as simply telling the story will partly answer those two questions. I will leave out telling you who the murderer is, as that would take out some of the fun of reading it, or watching Clair’s movie.\n\nThe action takes place on a remote island off the coast of Cornwall. In an age of limited technology it is more conceivable to understand how ten people could be trapped for three days with no means of being able to contact the mainland. Clearly such a story could not be easily moved to a contemporary setting without some adjustments.\n\nTen people are invited to the island under a series of pretexts. Most are invited as guests of the mysterious hosts, the Owens. A few have been offered employment by them, or invited in a professional capacity. It soon becomes clear that nobody has met the Owens, and the initials of their name spell U. N. Owen, which sounds like ‘Unknown’.\n\nThe guests are bemused by this remote location where their hosts are absent, and by the presence of ten figurines that appear to match those in an old nursery rhyme about ten Indian boys who die mysterious deaths. (In the original book, they were not Indian boys, but ‘n*gg*rs’ – I cannot bring myself to spell the word out. Christie’s casual racism is now mostly expunged from copies of her work, thankfully.)\n\nThe guests’ surprise turns to consternation when they hear a gramophone record with Mr Owen’s voice on it, which accuses them of having committed murder. The accusations are true. All of the guests have been responsible for the death of others in their past, but in such a way that their crime was beyond the reach of the law.\n\nSoon the guests start being murdered, each one in a method that tallies with a line in the nursery rhyme. Every time one of them is killed, another figurine is smashed. As there are no hiding places on the island, the guests come to the conclusion that Mr Owen is one of them, and they have to work out in order to avoid being murdered before the boat arrives at the end of the weekend.\n\nAs we can see, the plot has two notable qualities. Firstly it is ingenious, and it is easy to see why such a remarkable story would appeal to film studios. Secondly the story is utterly absurd when considered realistically. The idea that someone could successfully persuade ten people to come to an island (with no refusals), and then murder them all in line with the words in a nursery rhyme, and somehow do so without being caught is pushing the boundaries of believability too far.\n\nRené Clair incorporates all these elements in his film version, although he wisely omits a further point in Christie’s books, which is that the killer is eliminating the guests in ascending order of the gravity of their crime. Nonetheless, faced with such a preposterous plot, how does Clair manage to make such a brilliant movie?\n\nThe answer to this is simple. Clair recognised the only way to treat a storyline that is both ingenious and absurd – he turned it into a black comedy. At a stroke, many of the objections to Christie’s story vanished – we did not have to question the credibility of the story anymore because it was no longer necessary to take it seriously.\n\nOf course many adaptations of Christie novels are not exactly po-faced, and actors enjoy hamming it up, sometimes agreeably and sometimes embarrassingly. Clair’s approach is to allow the actors full rein to over-act provided that they do so in a manner that adds comedy rather than mere camp theatrics.\n\nThe character in And Then There Were None are all cardboard cut-outs identified by one or two quirks – the Russian Prince, the pious spinster, the drunken doctor etc. In this movie version, this hardly matters because the ten cast members bring life and vitality to their roles. The acting may be exaggerated, but everyone looks as if they are enjoying themselves.\n\nPerhaps now is the time to introduce these characters. I will give a brief thumbnail in alphabetical order to prevent giving away too many clues as to the identity of the murderer. The drunken doctor is Dr Armstrong (Walter Huston). His crime is related to operating on a patient while under the influence, and he takes regular swigs from a hip flask.\n\nNext is William Henry Blore, a detective supposedly hired to spy on the guests, but in reality another murderer brought to the island to face justice. The role is played by Roland Young, and he is a constant delight. Young fully exploits the comic potential of the dim-witted sleuth who often cries, “I get it!” before offering a foolish theory. The last time that he utters these words is a moment of high comedy that I will not reveal. We do not find out whether he did “get it”, but based on his previous epiphanies, I would not feel too hopeful.\n\nEmily Brent (Judith Anderson) is the Christian spinster who drove a nephew to suicide. Piously convinced of her worth, Brent cannot see her own guilt, but is quick to believe in the retribution that U N Owen dispenses to the other victims. There are a number of notions of justice offered in the film. We have a pious Christian, a detective, a judge and a doctor, all people with either thoughts or power of life and death, thereby adding to the complexity in trying to work out the identity of the killer.\n\nVera Claythorne (June Duprez) is a young lady hired as a secretary to Mr Owen, and accused of murdering her sister’s fiancé. This is the only straight role in the film, as Vera is the love interest and heroine. In later scenes, she is cast in dark clothing, and stands in shadow. The matching hero is Philip Lombard (Louis Hayward), an explorer accused of abandoning 21 East African tribesmen, and leaving them to die. Hayward invests his character with a dry wit, which prevents him seeming too bland.\n\nC Aubrey Smith plays General Mandrake, a doddering old fool who ordered his wife’s lover, a lieutenant, to perform a mission that led to his death. He exhibits hints of senility which casts doubt on his sanity. By contrast Judge Francis J Quincannon (Barry Fitzgerald) is sane and legal-minded. His crime is sentencing to death a man he knew was innocent. Quincannon offers a number of insightful deductions about the murderer, leading some to suspect he knows a little too much.\n\nI will leave the servants to last and mention Prince Nikita Starloff. Played in a wonderfully over-the-top manner by Mischa Auer this Russian noble swills wine down at a phenomenal rate, and his crime is one of running over a couple while under the influence.\n\nFinally there are Mr and Mrs Rogers, hired as servants for the house, who were responsible for poisoning a previous employer in order to obtain money she had left them in their will. Mrs Rogers (Queenie Leonard) is querulous and neurotic. Rogers (Richard Haydn) attempt to cut a dignified figure until he learns that the others think he is the murderer, and he begins to drink heavily.\n\nSomewhere between Dr Armstrong, Prince Nikita and Rogers, there is a lot of comic drunkenness in And Then There Were None, but Rogers takes the crowning glory. I particularly enjoyed the sight of a tipsy Rogers leaving the house and dropping his wine glass into an umbrella stand.\n\nThe script has its weaknesses, but there is much that it gets right. There is a sly line in retrospective irony in some of the scenes. “How would you like to spend your last days here?” Dr Armstrong asks Judge Quincannon. After Mrs Rogers drops some food on the floor and serves it up to the guests anyway, her husband comments, “Everyone has to eat a little peck of dirt before they die”. The first death occurs during a toast to crime.\n\nAn atmosphere of comic suspense is built up. Characters spy on one another. They stare through keyholes, and through binoculars. As the body count rises, they become paranoid. There are arguments over guns and keys. They cannot bear to be left alone with another person. They lock themselves in their bedrooms. They vote to decide who they suspect the most. The unfortunate Rogers is the prime suspect, and he is ordered to sleep in the coal shed.\n\nPerhaps inevitably the ending of the story is changed. Christie’s original tale is cold and relentless in its conclusion. While the ending cannot be said to be happy, there is no compromise on justice. Like many film versions, Clair’s movie takes its cue from a stage play rather than the book, and softens the final scene to offer a more commercial finish.\n\nThe acting is larger-than-life and the script has its amusing moments, but the real star of And Then There Were None is its director, René Clair. Clair began his career in silent movies, and like many of the directors who survived the transition to talkies, he used what he had learned in those early silent days to great effect. In fact the best parts of And Then There Were None are often non-verbal.\n\nThe first five minutes of the film contain no dialogue at all. The characters are first seen on the boat that takes them from the mainland to Indian Island. Clair employs a little trickery to move the camera from person to person. A scarf is blown in one man’s face, and then another. He drops a case into the lap of someone else. A hat blows across the boat between two people. The cigarette smoke blown by one character causes discomfort for another, but she cannot escape by turning her head away due to the seasickness of the person next to her.\n\nEven when the characters do finally introduce themselves verbally, Clair comes close to breaking the fourth wall. The characters say their names whilst directly facing the camera. It is as if they are introducing themselves to the viewer. A similar device is employed later when the surviving characters begin to confess their crimes. There is a determined effort to give equal time to whatever characters are still left alive at any given time. When the Judge concludes that “Mr Owen is one of us,” there are rapid cross-cuts showing the reactions of everyone in the room.\n\nSometimes Clair’s eye for visuals leads to truly arresting moments. We are shown scenes of the waves crashing against the coast, emphasising the isolation of the island. The shots are beautiful. For good measure, the opening credits include an effect whereby the words keep being washed away by waves while Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s impish music score preserves the comic tone.\n\nEven one of the murders is depicted in a scene of surprising elegance. We follow the patterns on the floor left by a spool of yarn leading up the stairs to the bedroom of the latest victim. The growing romance between Vera Claythorne and Philip Lombard is conveyed when we see them hold hands for a few seconds while the other guests are searching the house. How I long for the days when a romantic attachment could be conveyed in a simple gesture rather than by seeing them go to bed together, something rather far-fetched given the circumstances.\n\nOccasionally Clair’s effects are let down by the movie’s budget. Some of the backdrops are obviously sets or matte paintings. In one scene, a mystery about a banging door outside is rendered silly when we realise that the door they are looking for is directly in front of them.\n\nOn other occasions, Clair uses the camera for suspense, but he does so in a comic manner. Alarmed at being left alone with Dr Armstrong, the judge shouts for Rogers. The camera jerks to the left, and we see that Rogers has entered the room unbeknown, and is stood next to the judge.\n\nIn another scene, Vera goes upstairs alone. The camera tilts towards the ceiling. We hear her footsteps. They stop. She screams. The camera tilts down to show the others racing up the stairs. The camera tilts up. We hear their frantic footsteps, and the sound of a shot rings out, leaving us to wonder for a few moments who has fallen victim to the murderer this time.\n\nHowever perhaps the most comical visual effect occurs when three of the characters are having an animated discussion about the probable guilt of a fourth person. As they confidently marshal the facts, the camera zooms out a little to reveal a pair of feet sticking up in the air, and we realise that the prime suspect has just been exonerated.\n\nRené Clair’s adaptation of And Then There Were None is not a great work of art, Given the limitations of the subject material, how can it be? Nonetheless Clair turned out a brilliant work of entertainment that managed to convey the right balance of tongue-in-cheek suspense, and was able to breathe life into a story that is promising in conception but usually unconvincing in execution."
