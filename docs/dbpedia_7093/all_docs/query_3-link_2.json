Released in June 1945 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was directed by Albert Lewin, and stars George Sanders as Lord Henry Wotton and Hurd Hatfield as Dorian Gray. Shot primarily in black-and-white, the film features four colour inserts in three-strip Technicolor of Dorian's portrait; these are a special effect, the first two inserts picturing a youthful Dorian and the second two a degenerate one.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile posing for a painting by his friend Basil Hallward, handsome young aristocrat Dorian Gray meets Hallward's friend Lord Henry Wotton. Wotton persuades Gray the only worthwhile life is dedicated to pleasure, because \"what the gods give they quickly take away.\" Contemplating this, Gray wishes his portrait could age instead of him. He makes this wish in the presence of an Egyptian cat statue with supposed magical powers.\n\nAfter callously breaking off his engagement to tavern singer Sibyl Vane, Gray finds the portrait has begun to change and wonders if his wish may have come true. He has the portrait locked away in his old schoolroom and disguises its location by firing servants who moved the painting, while Gray, after Sybil's suicide, becomes more dedicated to a sinful and heartless life.\n\nYears later, Dorian is 40 but still looks 22. London society is awestruck at his unchanging appearance. The portrait has remained locked away, with Gray holding the only key. Over the years, the portrait of the young, handsome, Dorian Gray has warped into a hideous, demon-like creature reflecting his many sins. When Hallward sees his painting, Gray murders his friend and seals his body in the school room next to the portrait, then blackmails his friend, Allen Campbell, to dispose of Hallward's body. Campbell, distraught at his role in destroying Hallward's corpse, commits suicide.\n\nGray starts a romance with Hallward's niece, Gladys. James Vane, Sibyl's brother, follows Gray to his country estate to achieve revenge for Sibyl's death and is shot by accident during a hunting party.\n\nGray despairs at his impact on others and realises he can spare Gladys from misfortune by leaving her. After sending Gladys a letter breaking their engagement, Gray confronts his portrait and sees a subtle improvement. He stabs the portrait in the heart, seeking to end the spell, but cries out as if he has also been stabbed. His friends, realizing what has happened, burst into the schoolroom to discover Gray dead next to the portrait, his deformed body now reflecting his sins in physical form. The portrait, by contrast, once more shows Dorian Gray as a young, innocent man.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Sanders as Lord Henry Wotton\n\nHurd Hatfield as Dorian Gray\n\nDonna Reed as Gladys Hallward\n\nAngela Lansbury as Sibyl Vane\n\nPeter Lawford as David Stone\n\nLowell Gilmore as Basil Hallward\n\nRichard Fraser as James Vane\n\nDouglas Walton as Allen Campbell\n\nMorton Lowry as Adrian Singleton\n\nMiles Mander as Sir Robert Bentley\n\nLydia Bilbrook as Mrs. Vane\n\nMary Forbes as Lady Agatha\n\nRobert Greig as Sir Thomas\n\nMoyna Macgill as Duchess\n\nAnita Sharp-Bolster as Lady Harborough\n\nBilly Bevan as Malvolio Jones\n\nLilian Bond as Kate\n\nDevi Dja as Lead Dancer\n\nUncredited Cast\n\nCedric Hardwicke as Narrator\n\nMitchell Lewis as Waiter\n\nReginald Owen as Lord George Farmour\n\nDevi Wani as Dancer\n\nDevi Mima as Dancer\n\nDevi Tina as Dancer\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDifferences between movie and book\n\n[edit]\n\nChanges to the original include the romance between Gladys and David and “some censorship restrictions that kept Dorian's unspeakable acts offscreen.” [5] In the book, the picture alters in response to Dorian's \"good deed\", but the alteration is ugly, reflecting his cynicism and self-serving motivation. He stabs the painting to destroy his conscience and eliminate the evidence. In the film, he reads a faint change in the painting as a sign of hope, yet stabs the painting as if he can undo his past. As he is transformed off-screen, he prays for forgiveness.[5]\n\nThe paintings\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal audio Multimedia, Audio stop 728.mp3, Art Institute of Chicago\n\nTwo paintings of the character Dorian Gray were used in the film. The painting titled Picture of Dorian Gray used at the end of the film was painted on commission during the making of the film in 1943-1944 by Ivan Le Lorraine Albright, an American artist who was well known as a painter of the macabre. Created specifically for use in the film, it is now part of the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.[6] Albright painted and altered the picture while the movie was being made to allow it to represent the development of Dorian's character.[citation needed]\n\nThe portrait of Dorian Gray seen in the beginning of the film was painted by Henrique Medina, and is titled Portrait of Hurd Hatfield as Dorian Gray. It was originally sold at an MGM auction in 1970 when the contents of the studio were sold at a series of auctions lasting several months. It was then sold in a Butterfield and Butterfield Entertainment Memorabilia auction in 1997 for $17,250,[7] and in 2015 it sold at Christie's, New York, for $149,000 and is believed to be in a private collection.[8][9]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first piano piece played by Dorian to Sibyl is Frédéric Chopin's \"Prelude No 24 in D minor\". Played later in the Blue Gate Field house is Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\".\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $1,399,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,576,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $26,000.[3]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Result Category Recipient 1946 Academy Award Nominated Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Black-and-White John Bonar, Cedric Gibbons, Hugh Hunt, Hans Peters\n\nand Edwin B.
