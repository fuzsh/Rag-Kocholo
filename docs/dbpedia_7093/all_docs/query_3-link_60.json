        "text": "This list is debatable of course and you'll notice we were careful not to say these were the \"best movies set in Indiana\". We'll leave that list up to you.\n\nThere are others that could be added, \"A History of Violence\", \"Madison\" or any one of three movies about John Dillinger. But despite the fact a scene from the not-so-great movie \"Viper\" was shot in the IndyStar newsroom in 1987 - it will not be included in any list.\n\nHoosiers\n\nAbout Indiana and filmed in Indiana. Actor Gene Hackman stars as Coach Norman Dale starred in the 1986 movie, \"Hoosiers,\" about a fictional Hickory high school basketball team and their march to the state title. It was written by Hoosier Angelo Pizzo, based on the true story of Milan High School. In 2001, Hoosiers was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nA Christmas Story\n\n\"You'll shoot your eye out, kid!\" A Christmas Story is loosely based on writer Jean Shepherd's days growing up in Hammond's southeast side neighborhood of Hessville. Set in the fictional Hohman, Indiana, it tells the story of the loveable Ralphie Parker as he tries to secure a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas in 1940.\n\nBreaking Away\n\nThe 1979 movie about coming of age produced and directed by Peter Yates and written by Steve Tesich. Filmed in Bloomington. Stars Moocher (Jackie Earle Haley), Cyril (Daniel Stern), Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Dave (Dennis Christopher) graduate from high school and plot out their futures amid Indiana University college life.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nAlmost all of the first half of Close Encounters of the Third Kind is set in Indiana. A mid-air encounter between two jets and a UFO are observed at an air traffic control tower in Indianapolis. Characters Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is an electrical lineman, Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon) and her 3-year-old son, Barry live in Muncie. The set nicely incorporates Ball State memorabilia and references the Muncie Police department.\n\nRudy\n\nSean Astin starred in \"Rudy,\" the story of a Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, whose lifelong dream was to play football for Notre Dame despite a life of personal struggle and sacrifice. Filmed on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. It was ranked the 54th-most inspiring film of all time in the \"AFI 100 Years\" series.\n\nKnute Rockne: All American\n\nRonald Reagan co-starred in the 1940 film \"Knute Rockne: All American.\" Actor Pat O'Brien played the legendary coach, Knute Rockne.Reagan played George Gipp, the star player cut down in his prime by an illness. The movie that made the phrase \"Win one for the Gipper\" a permanent part of college football lore. Filmed on the campus of the University of Notre Dame.\n\nRetroIndy: When Hollywood came to the Indianapolis 500\n\nPre-Rat Pack: Sinatra, a mob boss and an erroneous hamburger order in Madison, Ind.\n\nTo Please a Lady\n\nFilmed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1950, Clark Gable stars as a ruthless midget racer whose reckless driving causes the death of another driver. Barbara Stanwyck plays a newspaper columnist who wants him banned from the sport of racing. It's got all the typical Hollywood elements: thrills, excitement and romance. A crew of 70 from MGM Studios set up shop at the speedway. Cinematographer Harold Rosson had 14 cameras trained on the racing, the crowd and action scenes.\n\nWinning\n\nThis 1969 movie features an all-star cast of Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Richard Thomas and Robert Wagner. Newman plays racer Frank Capua, who marries Woodward's character, who has a 15-year-old son (Thomas). Not only is Indianapolis Motor Speedway featured, but the Speedway Motel had a cameo appearance as well.\n\nRaintree County\n\nAdapted from the critically acclaimed novel of Ross Lockridge, Jr. and set in the fictional town of Freehaven in Raintree County, Indiana during the Civil War. Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift and Eva Marie Saint star.\n\nFriendly Persuasion\n\nBased on the 1945 novel by Jessamyn West The movie tells the story of the Birdwells, a Quaker family from Vernon, in southern Indiana during the Civil War and the way the war tests their pacifist beliefs. The film starred Gary Cooper, Dorothy Malone and Anthony Perkins.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons was produced and directed by Orson Welles. Welles adapted Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1918 novel, about the dwindling fortunes of an Indianapolis family and cultural and social changes during the advent of the automobile age.\n\nGoing All the Way\n\nFilmed in Fountain Square, \"Going All the Way\" was the movie adaptation of Dan Wakefield's 1970 novel which was filmed in 1997 and starred Ben Affleck and Jeremy Davies. The critics loved “Going All the Way,” but Indianapolis hated Wakefield's depiction of Indianapolis.\n\nThe Fault in our Stars\n\nBased on John Green's novel about two Indianapolis teens who meet in a support group for cancer patients and fall in love. While the movie was set in Indianapolis, it was filmed in Pittsburgh."
