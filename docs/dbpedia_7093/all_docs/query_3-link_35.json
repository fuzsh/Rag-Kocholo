John âBrickâ Brickley in charge of a group of U.S. Navy PT boats in the Philippines. He displays the fleetâs strengths for the admiral who remains impassive to the boatsâ capabilities. Brickâs commanding officer is excited for the men to join the combat efforts. He is annoyed by the dismissive attitude of the admiral and makes a request to be transferred upon hearing news of the Pearl Harbor attacks.\n\nThe Japanese navy and army invade the Philippines, leaving carnage in their wake. The local military does not deploy Brick and his squadron, forcing them to remain involved in more trivial tasks such as dealing with the mail and relaying messages. The men become increasingly frustrated.\n\nWhen their base is attacked, the admiral is forced to consent to Brickâs squadron launching an attack on a Japanese cruiser. Rusty is chosen to skipper one of the boats, but it is soon discovered that he is suffering from blood poisoning. He is commanded to remain in the sick bay.\n\nRusty gets angry and accuses his commanding officer of being a glory hound. He refuses to be evacuated to a military hospital but is forced to go anyway and is furious to discover his health is in grave danger. He starts up a romance with nurse Sandy Davys and also meets a patient named Ohio who encourages him to submit to the chain of command.\n\nUnder Brickâs directives, the cruiser sinks. The full squadron attacks and is increasingly victorious though lives and boats are lost at sea. The Philippines is in danger of falling soon.\n\nThe Japanese fight back against the Americans stationed at Bataan and on the Corregidor. The squadron informs General Douglas MacArthur that they are to evacuate the Pacific Theatre, moving everyone to Mindanao where they can travel to Australia. Rusty calls Sandy to tell her he will soon be evacuated, but their phone connection is lost.\n\nThe small crew assists MacArthur and his men on their journey to Australia. Attacks then recommence against the Japanese, and the squadron is reduced to only a small number of men and boats. Other men are ordered into battle as infantry.\n\nIn the final attack, Rustyâs boat sinks, and the remaining boats are given back to the US Army, leaving the final few squadron members back committed to messenger duty. Brick, Ryan, and two other soldiers are supposed to be airlifted out on the final plane. Upon their return to the United States, they will be involved in training new PT crews.\n\nRusty sees Ohio again and asks what has happened to Sandy, but Ohio doesnât know. One of the squadron arrives late, and Ohio has to give his seat to him, leaving him behind to face his imminent death or torture at the hands of the Japanese.\n\nIn this They Were Expendable film scene, the men are gathered in a bar to say goodbye to Doc after 30 years of faithful service. As the men all hold a drink in preparation for a toast, the Admiral shares a few remarks and then leads a toast to his old friend and colleague. He says.\n\nâIâm not gonna make a speech. Iâve just got something to say. Tomorrow, our old pal Doc here is going off. Heâs being paid off after 30 years. I know most of you kids got a long way to go before you find out what 30 years in the navy means. It means service, tough and good. It means serving your country in peace and in war.â\n\nOne of only a few scenes in They Were Expendable that was shot on a studio film set, there are several different bus lines that bring you to this popular attraction including routes 33, CC1, CC3, and R12."
