Strong lead performances carry “The Clock.”

Directed by Vincente Minnelli, 1945’s “The Clock” is a romantic drama about a Corporal (Joe) on a 2 day pass in New York. He’s unsure of where to go or what to see and is overwhelmed by the big city. In a chance encounter, he bumps into a secretary (Alice) and, from there on out, their lives are forever changed as they get to know one another, see what New York has to offer, and even deliver milk. As the pass runs out, however, Joe and Alice have to ponder their future together in a hurry.

In many ways, “The Clock” is a sort of proto “Before Sunrise” (although not as good as that masterpiece). It’s deceptively simple, it follows two characters in a short period of time, and it showcases the blossoming romance between the lead characters. The main difference is this one is a wartime romantic drama that partially focuses on the whirlwind life of a G.I. At its heart though, it’s a sweet drama about love, hopes, and dreams. Does the middle act feel a bit padded as it speeds towards the conclusion? Perhaps (especially the encounter with The Drunk), but few viewers are likely to complain about embarking on this journey together with Joe and Alice especially with its skillful direction by Minnelli and beautifully recreated New York sets.

Going back to the characters, there’s no denying that the movie lives and breathes on the chemistry between the lead actors. Thankfully, you have Judy Garland and Robert Walker in the main roles. The two are absolutely charming on screen together. It’s particularly rewarding to see Judy Garland in a non-musical role as she gets to show her range in what is essentially a character piece. Robert Walker plays a somewhat naive fish out of water (to a degree) who has a big heart. You really root for these two to have a future together.
