Ferdinand Philippe I (September 3, 1810 - September 2, 1887) was King of the French from 1848 until 1887. Born in exile in his mother's native Sicily, he was heir to the House of Orléans from birth. Following his father's succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the Prince Royal and subsequently Duke of Orléans (French: Duc d'Orléans), the title by which every French heir to the throne has since been known. He became King following his father's abdication as a result of the Revolution of 1848.
