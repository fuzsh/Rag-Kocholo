        "text": "Henri Eugène Philippe Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale (16 January 1822 – 7 May 1897) was a leader of the Orleanists, a political faction in 19th-century France associated with constitutional monarchy. He was born in Paris, the fifth son of King Louis-Philippe I of the French and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily and used the title Duke of Aumale.\n\nAumale became an infantry officer and saw active service in the French conquest of Algeria and in 1847 was appointed as its Governor-General. After the French Revolution of 1848, he went to live in England, where he pursued historical interests. The Franco-Prussian War enabled him to return to France, where he was elected to parliament and the Académie française. In 1872, he returned to the army as a Divisional General, and from 1879 to 1883 was inspector-general of the army."
