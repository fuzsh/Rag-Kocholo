        "text": "There are two claimants for the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\nThe Bonapartes make no claim for a restoration of the Empire and keep themselves low profile. tTe whole claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France is far from traditional, of course.\n\nFrom the two claimants to the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, only Henri d'Orléans has a claim to be taken au sérieux. Not only is he a direct descendant in the male lineage of the last King of France, he is also the most senior male Bourbon with respect to the separation of the House de Bourbon into a French and a Spanish branch (Treaty of Utrecht).\n\nThe direct male line from the last King of France to Gaston d'Orléans (2009):\n\nLouis-Philippe I d'Orléans, Roi des Français (1773-1850)\n\nx Princesse Marie-Amélie Thérèse de Bourbon-Deux Siciles (1782-1866)\n\n= Prince Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Éric Rosalino d'Orléans\n\nPrince Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Éric Rosalino d'Orléans (1810-1842)\n\nx Hélène Louise Elisabeth, Duchesse de Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1814-1858)\n\n= Prince Robert Philippe Louis Eugène Ferdinand d'Orléans\n\nPrince Robert Philippe Louis Eugène Ferdinand d'Orléans (1840-1910)\n\nx Princesse Françoise Marie Amélie d’Orléans (1844-1925)\n\n= Prince Jean Pierre Clément Marie d'Orléans\n\nPrince Jean Pierre Clément Marie d'Orléans (1874-1940)\n\nx Princesse Isabelle Marie Laure d’Orléans (1878-1961)\n\n= Prince Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie Louis Philippe d'Orléans\n\nPrince Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie Louis Philippe d'Orléans (1908-1999)\n\nx Princesse Isabelle Marie Amélie Louise Victoire Thérèse Jeanne d'Orléans-Bragance (1911-1999)\n\n= Prince Henri Philippe Pierre Marie d'Orléans\n\nPrince Henri Philippe Pierre Marie d'Orléans (1933)\n\nx Marie Thérèse Nadejda Albertine Rosa Philippine Margarethe Christine Hélène Josepha Martina Leopoldine, Duchesse de Württemberg (1934)\n\n= Prince Jean Charles Pierre Marie d'Orléans\n\nPrince Jean Charles Pierre Marie d'Orléans (1965)\n\nx Doña María Magdalena Philomena Juliana Johanna de Tornos y Steinhart (1977)\n\n= Prince Gaston Louis Antoine Marie d'Orléans\n\nThirst at all you doing great job with the genealogy. Second you say that the Prince Henri is the rightful heir to the French throne right? What about Duke of Anjou? What is the general opinion between French monarchist?\n\nThirst at all you doing great job with the genealogy. Second you say that the Prince Henri is the rightful heir to the French throne right? What about Duke of Anjou? What is the general opinion between French monarchist?\n\nIn essence the difference is:\n\nLuis-Alfonso:\n\n\"I am the rightful King of France because I am the most senior of all Bourbons\".\n\nHenri:\n\n\"I am the rightful King of France because I am the direct heir of the last King\".\n\nWhen the Bourbons inherited the strongest claim to the Spanish throne, the claim was passed to a younger son who became Felipe V de Borbón, Rey de España. The strict separation of the French and Spanish thrones was formalized in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714. This was the start of a formal split of the Bourbons into a French and a Spanish branch. Later the Spanish branch was furtherer split via similar international treaties to separate the Spanish throne from the Two Sicilies and from Parma.\n\nLuis-Alfonso only has a claim when we accept his rejection of the formal and strict division of the thrones of France and Spain, which was vested in the Treaty of Utrecht and signed on behalf of (and with the great seals of the following attached): King Louis XIV of France, King Felipe V of Spain, Queen Anne of Great Britain, King João V of Portugal, King Vittorio Amadeo II of Savoy, the Lords States-General of the United Provinces (Netherlands).\n\nSo who has the strongest claim? Purely on base of seniority and ignoring the Treaty of Utrecht: Luis Alfonso de Borbón. On base of seniority and respecting the Treaty of Utrecht: Henri d'Orléans. In essence Luis-Alfonso says: \"I wipe my *ss off with that paper, with those signs on behalf of my ancestors Louis XIV and Felipe V.\"\n\nSo only the victors of the war of the Spanish Succession signed the treaty of Utrecht, and not the losers [the Habsburgs]?\n\nNo wonder it is of doubtful legality. After the Treaty of Versailles [1919], was signed by all [western] participants, both winners and losers of WW1.\n\nIf the Treaty of Utrecht is declared null and void, then Gibraltar should return to Spain, the former French colonies in Canada should return to France, France should return the Principality of Orange to the Orange-Nassaus, the former Austrian territories in Italy (Milan, Naples, Sardinia, etc.) should return to Austria, etc. etc. etc. All these arrangements are part of that famous treaty.\n\nLuis Alfonso (and his supporters) say that \"the fundamental rights\" of the French monarchy can not be changed. Not by the King, not by his successors. According to these rules, the succession to the throne is hereditary, passing by primogeniture with exclusion of females. The King must also be Catholic. Let us take a look to all monarchies today: almost all of them have changed the succession (treating males and females equal), almost all of them have no requirements for the Faith of the King, etc. Imagine that today France was a monarchy and the King was not able to adapt to modern times because of \"the fundamental rights\" which were once vested in mediaeval times... This is all nonsens. Of course a King Louis-Alphonse would have signed any change adapted by the French Parliament (or loose his throne).\n\nNo one denies Luis Alfonso his unique position as the most senior Bourbon of all, but that is it. He is not in line of a throne, not in France, not in Spain, not in Two-Sicilies, not in Parma. At best he is a Spanish nobleman with a dazzling ancestry and heir to the Dukedom of Franco.\n\nBut also the Duke is Anjou is not the descendant of King Louis XIV? What you say he is only a Spanish nobleman? He has also the rightful to be heir to the throne.\n\nLuis Alfonso de Borbón is the most senior descendant of Louis XIV. There is no any misunderstanding and no dispute about that... He is the Ainé des Capétiens.\n\nHis ancestors Louis XIV (King of France) and Felipe V (King of Spain) signed the Treaty of Utrecht. The House of Bourbon would get Spain but in turn, they would agree with a strict separation of both thrones, for themselves and for for their descendants. In 1883 the line of Louis XIV became extinct in France. Therefore the claim went to the second most senior male lineage, which is the line of Louis XIII (the lineage of the present French claimant, Henri d'Orléans). However in Spain the line of Louis XIV still continues.\n\nThe most senior (legitimate) male lineage of Louis XIV in France\n\nLouis XIV (1643-1715)\n\nx Maria-Theresia, Archduchess of Austria (1638-1683)\n\n= Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)\n\nLouis (1661-1711)\n\nx Maria-Anna, Princess of Bavaria (1660-1690)\n\n= Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Burgundy (1682-1712)\n\nLouis (1682-1712)\n\nx Maria Adelaide, Princess of Savoy (1685-1712)\n\n= Louis XV, King of France (1710-1774)\n\nLouis XV (1710-1774)\n\nx Maria Leszczyńska (1703-1768)\n\n= Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France (1729-1765)\n\nLouis Ferdinand (1729-1765)\n\nx Maria Josepha, Princess of Saxony (1731-1767)\n\n= Charles X, King of France (1757-1836)\n\nCharles X (1757-1836)\n\nx Maria-Teresa, Princess of Savoy (1756-1805)\n\n= Charles-Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (1778-1820)\n\nCharles-Ferdinand (1778-1820)\n\nx Marie-Caroline de Bourbon, Princess of Two Sicilies (1798-1870)\n\n= Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, Count of Chambord (1820-1883)\n\nHenri (1820-1883)\n\nx Maria-Theresia, Archduchess of Austria (1817-1886)\n\n= the extinction of the legitimate male lineage of Louis XIV in France (1883)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe most senior (legitimate) male lineage of Louis XIV in Spain\n\nLouis XIV (1643-1715)\n\nx Maria-Theresia, Archduchess of Austria (1638-1683)\n\n= Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)\n\nLouis (1661-1711)\n\nx Maria-Anna, Princess of Bavaria (1660-1690)\n\n= Philippe, Duke of Anjou (Felipe V, King of Spain) (1683-1746)\n\nFelipe V (1683-1746) / renounced the throne of France for himself and all his descendants (1713)\n\nx Elisabetta Farnese, Duchess of Parma (1692-1766)\n\n= Carlos III, King of Spain (1716-1788)\n\nCarlos III (1716-1788)\n\nx Maria Amalia, Princess of Saxony (1724-1760)\n\n= Carlos IV, King of Spain (1748-1819)\n\nCarlos IV (1748-1819)\n\nx María Luisa de Borbón, Princess of Parma (1751-1819)\n\n= Francisco de Paula, Infante of Spain (1794-1865)\n\nFrancisco de Paula (1794-1865)\n\nx Luisa Carlota de Borbón, Princess of Two Sicilies (1804-1844)\n\n= Francisco de Asís de Borbón (1822-1902)\n\nFrancisco de Asís de Borbón (1822-1902)\n\nx Isabel II, Queen of Spain (1830-1904)\n\n= Alfonso XII, King of Spain (1857-1885)\n\nAlfonso XII (1857-1885)\n\nx María-Christina, Archduchess of Austria (1858-1929)\n\n= Alfonso XIII, King of Spain (1886-1941)\n\nAlfonso XIII (1886-1941)\n\nx Victoria Eugenie, Princess of Battenberg (1887-1969)\n\n= Jaime, Infante of Spain, Duke of Segovia (1908-1975)\n\nJaime (1908-1975) / renounced the throne of Spain for himself and all his descendants (1933 and again in 1969)\n\nx Emmanuelle de Dampierre (1913-2012)\n\n= Alfonso de Borbón, Duke of Cádiz (1936-1989)\n\nAlfonso de Borbón (1936-1989)\n\nx María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú (1951)\n\n= Luis Alfonso de Borbón (1974), Ainé des Capétiens, future heir to the title Duke of Franco\n\nLuis Alfonso de Borbón (1974)\n\nx María Margarita Vargas (1983)\n\n= Eugenia de Borbón (2007), future heiress to the title Duchess of Franco\n\n= Luis de Borbón (2010), future Ainé des Capétiens\n\n= Alfonso de Borbón (2010)\n\nTherefore agrees to Treaty of Utrecht the Duke of Anjou should not have any claim for the french throne. Why concider himself then legitimist pretender? And what mean \"Aine des Capetiens\"?\n\nThe legitimist camp how strong is in the France? Don Louis Alfonso don't have the french nationality ? I'm sorry if to stun but is very interesting all this.\n\nAnd thank you Pranter for the try. I don't speak french me to.\n\nAnd something last and I live you alone I promise. The Bonaparte family is not interested at all for the monarchy? They have supporters?\n\nCharles Bonaparte and his family live in France? I don't know anything about them.They have job?\n\nOh he is handsome. What he is doing to his life? What you mean the typical \"Napoleon look\"?\n\nWhy Louis-Alfonso and Charles-Philippe have the same title?\n\nThis title mean you are the heir? But the count of Paris don't have a son Prince Jean? Why give that title to the nephew and not the son?\n\nPerhaps the Prince Henri wanted to show who is in charge. I'm very sorry but all this are like a soap opera look forward to seeing the continuation and that i say with the funny side.\n\nAnd why not Prince Henri give that title to the younger son Prince Eudes?\n\nBut why he did that to explode and spanish royal family? For the Prince Henri understand he concider himself heir of the french throne but for the spain? He is so ambitius or stupid?\n\nIt is fortunate the Orleans have no chance of being restored to the non-existent thron,. Their perpetual feuding [both 'privately' and publicly [in the courts] does them no credit as a family, and would reflect badly on France were they its reigning family.\n\nHave so right. All such disputes for a non-existent throne .But maybe for these have some importance even in paper.\n\nI think understant Luis Alfonso. If he grandfather don't renounced the throne now would be the King of Spain and do not list. Whenever the throne stayed doing all it can to not lose. Perhaps the same can everyone else did. And for the hour with the Prince Jean does not have to split anything.\n\nTherefore agrees to Treaty of Utrecht the Duke of Anjou should not have any claim for the french throne. Why concider himself then legitimist pretender? And what mean \"Aine des Capetiens\"?\n\nAiné des Capétiens means: the most senior male of the whole Capet dynasty. The Légitimists consider the separation of the thrones as vested in the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in name of Louis XIV and Felipe V, as illegal because it would break the so called \"fundamental laws\" of the French monarchy.\n\nThese fundamental laws more or less say that the succession is a Droit Divin (a divine right), which should pass by primogeniture, with the exclusion of females and with the strict demand that the King must be Catholic. How can a man, no matter King Louis XIV of France or King Felipe V of Spain, accept the renunciation of a \"God-given right\", so is their argument.\n\nThen there is also a division inside the legitimist camp anyway: is being French a condition or not? The supporters of Don Luis Alfonso argue that princes of foreign nationality can still succeed to the French crown. Others say that French nationality of both the claimant and his ancestors is a requirement.\n\nLuis Alfonso has the French nationality as well, but not as son of a Frenchman. He got it via his paternal grandmother Emmanuelle de Dampierre (daughter of the French Roger de Dampierre, Vicomte de Dampierre and of the Italian Donna Vittoria dei principi Ruspoli).\n\nI think the Orléanist movement is stronger than the Legitimist one. Especially also because the last one is connected with very conservative catholics, very right-wing or traditionalist French movements which believe in absolutism and want the return of Catholicism as state religion, etc, Needless to say that this is not how the average modern-day Frenchman thinks. By the way, Don Luis Alfonso de Borbón and Prince Jean d'Orléans go well together, They are polite and respect each other. They both know that they represent a grand history and show a well-mannered and respectful attitude.\n\nSee picture: http://www.sylmpedia.fr/images/2/2e/Louis_XX_et_Jean_d%27Orl%C3%A9ans.jpg\n\nDon Luis Alfonso de Borbón y Martínez Bordiú\n\nPrincess Philomena d'Orléans née De Tornos y Steinhart\n\nPrince Jean d'Orléans (holding his son Prince Gaston)\n\nThis title mean you are the heir? But the count of Paris don't have a son Prince Jean? Why give that title to the nephew and not the son?\n\nThe title Duc d'Anjou was always given to a younger son :\n\nThe 3rd son of Henri IV, King of France\n\nThe 2nd son of Louis XIII, King of France\n\nThe 2nd son of Louis XIV, King of France\n\nThe 2nd son of Louis \"Le Grand Dauphin\"\n\nThe 3rd son of Louis \"Le Petit Dauphin\"\n\nThe 4th son of Louis XV, King of France\n\nThe 4th son of Louis, Dauphin of France\n\nBesides that, note that Prince Jean is not the eldest son of Prince Henri d'Orléans. He has an elder brother, Prince François d'Orléans (1961). This Prince is severely disabled because of toxoplasmosis. Nevertheless he is the rightful Dauphin de France. Because of his handicap, his younger brother Prince Jean d'Orléans (1965) became appointed \"Régent du Dauphin\" by their father.\n\n- Prince Henri d'Orléans, Chef de la Maison de France (1933)\n\n1 Prince François d'Orléans, Dauphin de France (1961)\n\n2 Prince Jean d'Orléans, Régent du Dauphin (1965)\n\n3 Prince Gaston d'Orléans (2009)\n\nThe Dauphin and his sister Princess Blanche live in a special institution in Fribourg (Switzerland). In holidays they spend their time with their mother, the Duchesse de Montpensier and their siblings.\n\nAnd why not Prince Henri give that title to the younger son Prince Eudes?\n\nThe three sons of Prince Henri d'Orléans were all born in the 1960's, far from the feud with Luis Alfonso de Borbón about the title Duc d'Anjou. My guess is that they never used that title, to prevent eventual controverses. When Luis Alfonso de Borbón assumed the title Duque de Anjou (like his father and grandfather did) ánd especially started to use the un-differented royal arms of the Kings of France (the three fleur-de-lys on a field azure proper), this probably made Prince Henri d'Orléans explode...\n\nTo explain the differences in the use of the coat-of-arms:\n\nThe House of Orléans used this coat-of-arms. Above the three fleurs-de-lys d'or, a lambel d'argent (silver label) is visible. Such a label was used to indicate a junior branch (cadet) of a family.\n\nWhen the male lineage of Louis XIV in France (the senior branch) became extinct in 1883, the House of Orléans started to use the royal coat-of-arms without the label. With this they indicate that they are the most senior French royal branch and have the right to use the un-differented coat-of-arms of the House of France:\n\nThe Spanish Royal House, despite the fact that they are descendants from Louis XIV and the more senior branch (!), respects the separation from the throne of France and does NOT claim the un-differented Bourbon coat-of-arms.\n\nThis is the arms of the House of Anjou, from which the Spanish Royal House descends:\n\nThis emblem forms the heart of the coat-of-arms of Spain:\n\nWhat did Luis-Alfonso de Borbón do? He used the title Duc d'Anjou. As a descendant of the Spanish House Bourbon-Anjou he naturally should have used the arms of the House of Anjou, like the Spanish royal family:\n\nas heartshield:\n\nThat sounds logic: he is a descendant from the House of Anjou ánd he claims to be Duque de Anjou. But what did Luis Alfonso? He thought: \"Wait a minute: I am not only the Duke of Anjou, the most senior male of the House of Anjou....\n\nI am the most senior Bourbon of all!! The undifferenced coat-of-arms, the three golden fleurs-de-lys on a field azure proper belong to me! These are my arms, the arms of the Kings of France!\":\n\nas heartshield:\n\nIt seemed not only Prince Henri d'Orléans was enraged. Also King Juan Carlos of Spain was most \"not amused\" with these adventures of his Spanish cousin. That is an explanation why we never see Luis Alfonso de Borbón on Spanish royal events. The only difference is that red cadre around the coat-of-arms, but for royals it makes a whole difference...."
