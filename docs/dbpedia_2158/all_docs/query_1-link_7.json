        "text": "I know this is going a bit off topic...Didn't know where to post this...sorry ...\n\n-Does anyone how Astrid felt, was Lorenz the only boyfriend she had? Like I mean she seems to really love the job of being a mother, wife of a banker, and regular princess duties. Not trying to stir up anything.\n\n-What was the belgian attitude towards their engagement announcement?\n\n-Makes you view King Albert and Queen Poala in a new light...really modern...cared for the well being and happiness of their kids first over the familiy's 'social status'.\n\n-Wonder why they [Albert and Poala] gave in? Did Baudouin threaten Albert, that he would be taken out of the line of succession?\n\nAccording to the article I read(a Belgian periodical that was written in French) the Princess had led a very sheltered life within the BRF when she met the Archduke at her 18th birthday ball which was held at Laeken Palace. I don't know if he was her first serious boyfriend but I am willing to bet he probably was. Albert and Paola didn't have anything against Lorenz but they insisted that the couple delay the engagement for a few years, and rightfully so. For Astrid it was love at first sight, and she was determined to marry Lorenz.\n\nOnce Baudouin gave his approval it was only a matter of time anyway. Baudouin and Fabiola adored Astrid and were undoubtedly delighted with her choice.\n\nNo I don't think Baudouin \"threatened\" Albert at all. From what I have read about their relationship, Baudouin loved his younger brother deeply and always excused or ignored his scandals, and Albert loved and admired Baudouin and was unswervingly loyal to him. It was probably simply a matter of Baudouin persuading Albert and Paola to let Astrid and Lorenz marry.\n\nFor a long time, before Philippe married, it seemed like Astrid and her children would inherit the Belgian throne.\n\nThe Belgian royal family was probably one of the strictest on the marrying fellow royals/high nobility. By 20th century, even the 19th century, arranged marriages among royals were very rare. Granted Royal-commoner marriages were rare too, but the Belgians seemed to practice arranged marriage well into the 20th century e.g. Marie-Jose and the future Umberto II of Italy, and Josephine-Charlotte and the future Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg (they say she was in love w/ a tennis player at the time of her marriage).\n\nExactly. I think if Philippe and Mathilde had been married at the time of King Baudouin's death, there would not have been as much opposition to the idea of his assuming the Throne.\n\nPrince Albert and King Baudouin just happened to fall in love with and marry noblewomen\n\nbut I can't imagine either of them marrying a commoner, especially not Baudouin.\n\nAs luck would have it Philippe, like so many members of the Belgian RF, has been extraordinarily fortunate in marriage. He and Mathilde seem perfect for one another, I can't imagine that he has any reqrets about any past loves.\n\nI've heard rumors about Infanta Cristina and Philippe as well, they were seen together skiing in Baqueira Beret and in some acts around, I think they were friendly but don't know how close they were\n\nEL MUNDO\n\nhttp://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o39/dagmarnat/CRISTINA 3/phillipeandcristina.jpg\n\n(Hola, look at her outfit, that screams 80's all the way )\n\nIt was said that Philippe pursued Cristina in their youth but that she said no (I read it somewhere, don't remember exactly where )\n\nI had no idea that they were (allegedly) a couple.The picture does not work for me by the way.\n\nAnyway,Philippe does not look like the type of person who has had a lot of girlfriends.He has always seemed like a mature man.\n\nIn the german magazines there where some rumours about Countess Anna Plater-Syberg in the 90's and also about another woman Sigrid van Erps who was from Switzerland if i remember correct.\n\nAnna Plater-Syberg later went into a convent btw.\n\nFiametta de Frescobaldi later married the second son of the duke of Arenberg and a princess of Bavaria and thus is a regular guest at Belgian noble and royal gatherings.\n\nStill, the only 'serious' relationship he had before Mathilde is said to be with Barbara Marselis indeed, which was broken of by his father and court as she was not noble. Barbara ended up marrying the son of an artist friend of Queen Paola.\n\nhttp://www.hln.be/hln/nl/947/Royalt.../17/Filip-moest-jeugdliefje-echt-dumpen.dhtml\n\nAccording to one of the many stories about the meeting of Philippe & Mathilde, it was actually Stephanie de Lalaing (who denies that they ever had a relationship) who pointed out Mathilde to him, and said 'look, there is a nice devout girl for you'.\n\nShe is better of being married with an unknown nobleman than with Philippe, King of a very troubled and problematic state, with strong separatistic tendences and federal parts more and more drifting apart. Some label Belgium as a failed state even, where nothing works. It is not thát pleasant to be Queen of the Belgians.\n\nBelgium is not a failed state and was actually the 17th wealthiest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita in 2014 according to the World Bank. In the past, Belgium was one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution in continental Europe and the seat of an important colonial empire in central Africa. Furthermore, despite minority separatist movements, there is no indication that the Belgian federation will break up anytime soon.\n\nI suspect that, like a few other Dutchmen, you are not over the Belgian revolution of 1830 yet.\n\nI am sure most have gotten over the treachery of the 'ungrateful Belgians' by now .\n\nHowever, the discussion of Belgium as a failed state is not a Dutch or a French one. It is a discussion currently held in Belgian newspapers. It is mainly led by CEO's of big companies who seem frustrated that nothing ever gets done due to all the layers of bureaucracy. The infrastruture is crumbling, the police actions sometimes remind us of Louis de Funès' movies etc. But as you say: all is relative, it is one of the richest countries in the world."
