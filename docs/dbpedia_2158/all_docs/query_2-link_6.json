        "text": "Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orleans, was the first son of King Louis Philippe I of France. He was born in exile in Sicily in 1810 and he died very young, at age only 32 in 1842.\n\nHe is described as a handsome man, and that's what I see from his portraits - I always thought he resembled Albert, Prince Consort a lot with the facial hair and all. It is said that he was very charismatic and had prospects of a nice military career if he lived longer.\n\nHe was married with Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Their marriage is described as very happy and produced two children: Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (1838–1894), who was Prince Royal, and Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres (1840–1910).\n\nI was always interested in his life and personality. I would love to know more about his marriage with Helene - what was their life together like, how they were as parents, etc.\n\nAlso, I would like to know if there are any primary sources such as his diaries and letters preserved in France or a royal archive and where exactly?\n\nPlease, if any of you know of a book about his life, old or new edition, send me the titles and names of the authors, as I am much interested in reading about this fascinating royal!\n\nFeel free to share some of his portraits so we can appreciate his good looks!\n\nThank you, everyone.\n\nBest,\n\nKallia\n\nI recently read an article about Ferdinand’s search for a bride but can’t find it right now. I’ll keep looking. I think it ended up in box of royalty-related magazines I put in storage.\n\nI do know Ferdinand had a difficult time finding a wife. Many of the Catholic royal families regarded the Orleans family as usurpers and shunned them (the Habsburgs of Austria included) so Ferdinand searched for a Protestant bride instead. Initially he showed interest in a daughter of King Wilhelm I of Wurttemberg who refused to consent to a match, presumably because he feared the Orleans family would be toppled from the throne and his daughter would end her life in exile, just as his sister Catherine had (she married Jerome Bonaparte). Eventually Ferdinand settled on Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a “lesser” royal (her father was only a Grand Duke). The marriage was happy but because she was a Protestant and a liberal Helene had a difficult relationship with her devoutly Catholic mother-in-law Queen Marie Amelie. Following the revolution of 1848 Helene spent most of her time in her native Germany.\n\nHere are some other sources I’ve run across. I’m no expert on the Orleans family so there might be others I’ve missed.\n\nFerdinand’s sons published a book with his letters: Lettres 1825-1842: Publiés par ses fils le Comte de Paris et le Duc de Chartres (1889). The book is available online: https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k246093\n\nThe Archives Nationales in Paris holds many personal papers of the Orleans family:\n\nhttps://francearchives.fr/findingaid/17c815cd696f2f22f24b0d35f2bdb65c077a9b7d\n\nPrince Michael of Greece (son of Princess Francoise of Orleans) published a book about the Orleans family. According to the description the photographs date from 1860-1940 but I suppose there might be a least one or two pictures of Ferdinand and Helene:\n\nhttps://www.royalbooks.se/produkt/38/bourbon-orleacuteans-a-family-album.html\n\nI’m currently reading a book called Sons and Heirs: Succession and Political Culture in Nineteenth Century Europe, ed. Frank Lorenz Müeller and Heidi Mehrkens (2016). It includes an article about the political impact of Ferdinand’s death: “The Impossible Task of Replacing a Model Heir: The Death of Ferdinand-Philippe d’Orléans and the ‘New France’” (pp. 196-207). These are some of the sources it cites:\n\n1) Arnaud Teyssier, Les Enfants de Louis-Philippe et la France (2006).\n\n2) Anne Martin-Fugier, Louis-Philippe et sa Famille 1830-1848, 2nd ed. (2012).\n\n3) Joelle Hureau, L’espoir Brisé. Le Duc d’Orléans 1810-1842 (1995).\n\n4) Renate Löschner, Helene Herzogin von Orléans – eine Mecklenburgerin im Französichen Könighaus des 19. Jahrhunderts (2009).\n\n5) Jeanne-Paule d’Harcourt, Die Herzogin von Orléans Helene von Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1859).\n\nAvailable online:\n\nhttps://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10101247.html\n\n6) Adrien Pascal, Vie Militaire, Politique et Privée de Son Altesse Royale Mgr.lle Duc d'Orléans: Avec Notes Historiques sur les Campagnes d'Afrique Rédigées par le Prince (1842). Available online: https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100879272\n\n7) Achille Eyraud, Histoire de S. A. R. Mgr le duc d'Orléans racontée aux enfants (1842). Available online: https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5652137t\n\n8) La vie et la mort du prince royal duc d'Orléans (1842)\n\nAvailable online: https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5651548p\n\n9) Heidi Mehrkens, The Prince, the President and the Cholera (2012)\n\nAvailable online: Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orleans | Heirs to the Throne Project\n\nTo find other [old] online books you could also search Gallica (digital library of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France) at BnF - Gallica â€“ The BnF digital library\n\nYou could also search HathiTrust, another tool for locating online books. For example, here are the search results I did for books about Ferdinand: https://tinyurl.com/y7lsh699\n\nSearch results for Helene: https://tinyurl.com/y73altha\n\nFor print books you could search WorldCat: https://www.worldcat.org/\n\nGood luck! I’ve become more interested in the Orleans family myself after reading about the recent death and funeral of the Comte de Paris."
