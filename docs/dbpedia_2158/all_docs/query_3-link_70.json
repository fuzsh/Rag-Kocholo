        "text": "This image comes from the online Museum of the Art Renewal Center (ARC), http://www.artrenewal.org, the Internet's largest online art collection, showing beautiful representational artwork from all of art history and featuring the great, forgotten works of the 19th century.\n\nThese top-quality Fine Art Prints are printed on Archival Fine Art Canvas which is perfect for framing, or Archival Fine Art Paper: fine art velvet or ulrasmooth, depending on paper size. All orders are custom printed and shipped flat in boxes for domestic orders. International orders are shipped on rolls due to Customs' size restrictions.\n\nThe ARC Store is known for the quality of our prints. In order to create our archive of artworks we have sought out images from many scholarly sources, some of which are not suitable for reproduction at every size. We will search our print files when you place your order and do our best to supply you with the print size that you have requested. Many of our images have never been tested and are not available anywhere else. Our utmost goal remains to make these images available to the public and we do not evaluate selections for the ARC Museum based on their commercial print value. Unsatisfactory prints if returned can be replaced one time only with a different image in the same size at no cost.\n\nThe Art Renewal Center reproduces prints as accurately as possible based on the original paintings. We do not distort the image in any way to make it fit standard print sizes. The images are enlarged or reduced proportionally to fit as close to the standard size as possible. This means that we do not crop the image of the painting and each print will have every detail of the original painting. This also means that most prints will have a white border which can be covered with matte board prior to framing.\n\nPlease choose a size and price option from the drop-down list, then press Order.\n\nAvailability: Usually ships in 5-7 business days\n\nINGRJ9293 $35.00\n\nType:"
