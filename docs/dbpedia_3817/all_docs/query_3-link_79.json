Applicants who are unable to apply online or through a Community Navigator, and require an accommodation, may apply by phone at 1 (833) 912-0878 or by mail using a paper application:\n\nArizona Rental Assistance Application - English (ARA-1000A)\n\nArizona Rental Assistance Application (Large Print) - English (ARA-1000A-LP)\n\nArizona Rental Assistance Application - Spanish (ARA-1000A-S)\n\nArizona Rental Assistance Application (Large Print) - Spanish (ARA-1000A-SLP)\n\nApplicants interested in rental assistance will need to provide a copy of the lease/rental agreement, proof of identity (photo ID), proof of income, direct deposit bank information, proof of housing instability (eviction notice or past due rent notice) and proof of employment, support, or completion of educational, vocational, or job training program for a household member. Failure to provide the required documentation may delay eligibility determination, and could result in an application denial.\n\nLandlords may also apply on behalf of a tenant by registering online at the Housing Stability and Utility Assistance Programs website. The landlord, or an agent or representative of the landlord’s company, must complete identity verification as part of the registration process. Once the registration is approved, the landlord can initiate an application and provide the tenant’s email address. The tenant will receive an email to complete the application.\n\nEligible households may receive a lump-sum assistance payment equal to three (3) times the household’s monthly rent, not to exceed $10,500. Program benefits may be used to cover rental arrears, future rent, and rent late fees and penalties.\n\nAn applicant must provide their landlord’s contact information as part of the application process. The landlord will be contacted three times to provide a notice and opportunity for the landlord to participate in the program, and receive the tenant’s benefits payment directly. If the landlord does not timely complete the application or declines to participate in the program, the tenant may receive any assistance payment directly.\n\nIf you disagree with your application decision, you have two options for resolution:\n\nOption 1 - You may request reconsideration by submitting this ARAP/LIHEAP Decision Review form within 10 calendar days. Reconsideration is an internal review of the decision, and the fastest way for you to have your case reviewed. After reconsideration, if you are not satisfied with the decision, then you may appeal by submitting this Appeal Request form within 60 days.\n\nOption 2 - You may immediately appeal, without reconsideration, to have your application decision reviewed by the administrative court. If you request an appeal, you cannot also request reconsideration. Any questions regarding the program decision will be addressed during a pre-hearing conference. You can file an appeal by submitting an Appeal Request form within 60 days of the decision.\n\nDES will mitigate fraud by verifying the identities of prospective tenant and landlord applicants prior to the submission of an application using the identity verification service ID.me. During the application process, applicants will receive notice through their selected method of communication with a unique link and instructions on how to use ID.me.\n\nTenants requiring an accommodation may submit a paper application with government-issued photo identification to verify their identity if unable to use ID.me. Landlord representatives/employees can verify identity through ID.me and then enter the landlord company’s tax and banking information in the application.\n\nIndividuals or landlords who suspect fraud or believe they may have been a victim of identity theft used to file a fraudulent application for rental assistance can submit a fraud report online to DES or contact the fraud hotline at 1 (800) 251-2436 or (602) 542-9449. When reporting potential fraud, please be prepared to provide identifying information that will help locate the application in our systems.\n\nThe Arizona Rental Assistance (ARA) program by DES covers 14 counties and all Members residing on Indian Lands of Federally Recognized Tribes. In addition, residences in zip codes assigned to the cities of Phoenix and Mesa are also covered by the DES program.\n\nTenants residing in Maricopa County (other than City of Phoenix, Glendale, and Mesa residents) are not eligible for Arizona Rental Assistance by DES, but may be eligible for similar city or county-operated programs in their area.\n\nInformation on how to apply for these programs is listed below.\n\nCity and County Programs City/County Website Phone Number Glendale Glendale Crisis Assistance Programs (623) 930-2854 Chandler Eviction Prevention Assistance (480) 963-1423 extension 118 Maricopa County\n\n*all cities except: Phoenix, Mesa, Glendale, Chandler, Gilbert Maricopa County Human Services Department (602) 506-5911"
