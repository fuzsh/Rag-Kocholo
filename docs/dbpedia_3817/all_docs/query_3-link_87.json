        "text": "Facing up to NCDs\n\nThe problem of NCDs marks a shift in the public health landscape of Samoa. Historically the largest public health concerns were infectious and parasitic diseases. Today, however, half the population has at least three of the five risk factors that can contribute to developing NCDs: smoking, elevated blood pressure, high body mass index, poor diet and low levels of physical activity.\n\nMany people at risk for or living with an NCD remain undiagnosed because rates of detection and referrals to care remain low.\n\nOver the last 30 years, the government of Samoa focused on modernizing clinical services. This led to a centralization of services and a hospital-based model of care. Dealing with the rapid rise in NCDs, however, requires a different approach - one which combines population-level screening, community engagement and long-term chronic disease management.\n\nThe government recognizes that the current model of care is not well equipped to respond to this public health crisis. It cannot meet the demands placed on the health system from increasing numbers of people requiring long-term care and support for chronic disease management. Addressing the NCD epidemic requires action at individual and community levels to strengthen promotive, preventive and curative services.\n\nAs a first step, the government has decided to integrate the two existing health structures: the Ministry of Health (MoH), responsible for policies, surveillance and monitoring, and the National Health Service (NHS) which oversees service delivery. These reforms have been passed into law, but given a shortage of available resources, their reintegration will be a gradual process.\n\nPEN Fa’a Samoa\n\nThe Samoan government enlisted the assistance of the WHO Country Office for Samoa in mapping the way forward for the implementation of a primary health care model. Putting a focus on NCDs was seen as a way to catalyze health system transformation, revitalize primary health care services in the community, and support existing human resources.\n\nPEN (package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions) is a prioritized set of cost-effective strategies for the prevention, early detection and management of key NCDs. These interventions are designed to be easily delivered in resource-constrained settings.\n\nThrough a series of meetings and workshops, the NHS, the Ministry of Health and WHO adapted the interventions to the Samoan context, and PEN Fa’a Samoa was born.\n\nIn traditional Samoan culture, each village or community has its own governance structure and hierarchy. This includes the Komiti Tumana, or women’s committees, and by working through them to deliver prevention, detection, and referral services, the PEN Fa’a Samoa initiative seeks to incorporate the PEN interventions into Samoan culture and traditions.\n\nPiloting community approaches\n\nThe first phase of work was to develop specific national guidelines for the initiative, which would include individual, peer, family and community mobilization components. WHO worked with the health authorities to develop the criteria and the tools that women volunteers of the Komiti Tumana and health care workers would use for assessment, monitoring and referral.\n\nThen the MoH launched a pilot programme involving seven villages. Members of the Komiti Tumana were approached to assist in carrying out village-wide screening campaigns.\n\nThese women’s committees have existed since the 1920s and are therefore especially well positioned to help raise awareness and facilitate the testing part of the campaign. Working with and through the Komiti Tumana was the best way to ensure that the NCD initiative would be well received by villagers.\n\nThe women’s committee volunteers, who showed a great deal of support for the initiative, were paired with health care workers to create crossdisciplinary outreach teams.\n\nWHO provided training to the volunteers and paired each volunteer with a health care worker. Outreach teams invited the entire adult population of each village to participate in the screenings. The women’s committee members collected demographic information and basic health data while the health care workers measured blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, villagewide public meetings were held and the overall, anonymized assessment of results was presented to the whole village. The teams also followed up with individuals deemed to be at high risk."
