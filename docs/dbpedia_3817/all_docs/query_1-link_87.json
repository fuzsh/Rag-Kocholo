Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nMalielegaoi has been Samoa's leader for 22 years, and lost last month's election in an unexpected 26-25 loss for the prime minister, according to NPR. Mata'afa and her party won after appealing new election rules set by the Supreme Court.\n\nAfter determining the final election count, Samoa's Supreme Court ordered the Parliament to meet, based on a constitutional requirement asking lawmakers to meet within 45 days of an election. Monday's lock-out marked the final day that Mata'afa could form a government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside parliament, Mata'afa remained defiant as her supporters cheered her on, saying, \"There will be a time when we will meet again, inside that House. Let us leave it to the law.\"\n\nMalielegaoi held a news conference on Monday and said, \"There is only one government in Samoa, even if we are just the custodian government. We remain in this role and operate business as usual.\"\n\nSo far, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Aldern stopped short of calling for Malielegaoi to resign, but called on all parties to uphold the election result, and maintained that New Zealand would play a \"non-interventionist\" role in any political transition.\n\nRead next\n\nWatch: Lebanon was already in financial crisis before the explosion in Beirut — and now experts are predicting devastating consequences\n\nAdvertisement"
