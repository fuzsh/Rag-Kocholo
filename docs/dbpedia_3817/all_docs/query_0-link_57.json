        "text": "Image source: Hoss, A. (2019). Federal Indian law as a structural determinant of health. Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, 47(S4), 34-42.\n\nIndigenous Nations are inherently sovereign based on their governments’ existence prior to colonization; however, Federal Indian Law places “practical” limits on Tribal sovereignty, in that the U.S. government provides their own interpretation of how it can exist. The U.S. federal government only recognizes the sovereignty of 574 Tribal Nations. Dozens more Tribes are unrecognized by the federal government and may be working toward recognition, including some Tribes that lost recognition during the Termination Era (1945-1960)—when the federal government took away federal recognition and land in an attempt to dissolve Tribal governments and assimilate their populations (Native Hawaiians, Other Pacific Islanders, and Taino descendants do not have any federal recognition of their sovereignty).\n\nEarlier case law also aimed to take land. Three U.S. Supreme Court cases known as the Marshall Trilogy (Johnson v. McIntosh in 1823, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia in 1831, and Worcester v. Georgia in 1832) took Indigenous lands through the Doctrine of Discovery. The cases limited who Tribes could sell or cede land to (only the federal government); characterized Tribes as “domestic dependent nations” and related them to the United States as a “ward to his guardian,” such that the United States had trustee responsibilities to protect their resources and well-being and provide educational services; and determined that, although considered “dependent” on the U.S. government, Tribes have the “right to self-government.” While these cases restricted the external powers of Indigenous Peoples, they also recognized limited but persistent Tribal sovereignty over Tribal lands and members. In 1886, the U.S. Supreme Court decided United States v. Kagama, which gave the U.S. Congress “plenary power” to extinguish Tribal sovereignty (in the practical sense) at any time.\n\nBeyond limiting sovereignty, federal policy has also caused great harm to Indigenous Peoples’ health and well-being through warfare, disease, deceitful treaties, slavery, and forced relocation—practices considered justified by the Doctrine of Discovery. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced tens of thousands of American Indians from their homelands in the southeastern United States to lands roughly 1,000 miles away. Thousands died from disease, winter weather, and starvation along what is now described as the Trail of Tears. The 1887 Dawes Act further disrupted Indigenous communities when it deliberately broke up reservation land and sold it to non-Native people. In 1968, Congress passed the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), which described the limited governmental powers Indigenous Nations are allowed to possess, according to their colonizer, the U.S. government.\n\nThe United States purchased Alaska from Russia in the 1867 Russian-U.S. Treaty of Cession, even though Alaska Natives did not recognize Russia as the owners of Alaska. The United States annexed Hawaii in the 1898 Newlands Resolution, claiming ownership of all islands of Hawaii without the consent of the Hawaiian sovereign government. Territories with Indigenous populations were acquired through the 1898 Treaty of Paris (Guam, Puerto Rico); the 1900 and 1904 cessions of the islands of Tutulia and Manu’a, respectively, and a 1925 act of the U.S. Congress relating to Swain Island (American Samoa); and the 1947 United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). Most Indigenous Peoples in the United States and its territories have had most, if not all, of their land taken by the United States. Kimmerer explains, “To the settler mind, land was property, real estate, capital, or natural resources. But to our people, it was everything: identity, our connection to the ancestors, the home of non-human kinfolk, our pharmacy, our grocery store, our library, the source of everything that sustained us.”\n\nFurther assimilation practices have also led to loss of life, cultures, and languages. These include forced and coercive attendance at government and missionary boarding schools beginning in the 1800s, which did not allow Indigenous cultures or languages; restrictions on spiritual practices through the Religious Crimes Code in 1883, which were not lifted until the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment rights were granted to Indigenous Peoples in the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (even though their U.S. citizenship had been established in the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act); sterilization of American Indian women without their consent by the U.S. Indian Health Service; and disconnection fostered by the 1940s and 1950s Indian Relocation Program, which decreased funding to reservations and moved Native people from reservations to cities with little preparation or support.\n\nFederal policy efforts that attempt to address race equity and health for Indigenous Peoples and communities should emphasize decolonization. Health inequities experienced by Indigenous Peoples are directly linked to their colonization through treaties, case law, statutes, and policies, which over time have included genocide through wars and massacres; diseases; forced removal from their homelands; boarding schools and related assimilation policies; racism; and legislation suppressing cultures, religions, and languages. Colonization is not over: There has never been decolonization or an overhaul of Federal Indian Law and the policies, case law, and legislation that continue colonization of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nColonization results in historical trauma, which is the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding that Indigenous people experience over their lifespans and across generations. Historical trauma impacts the well-being of Indigenous individuals, families, and communities. Increased cumulative stress from historical trauma can have direct, negative impacts on health and drive the adoption of unhealthy behaviors, resulting in adverse mental, behavioral, physical, social, and relational health; high rates of suicide, substance misuse, adverse childhood experiences, poverty, maternal morbidity and mortality, food insecurity, rape, assault, and homicide; overrepresentation in the criminal justice system; environmental injustice; and more. These disparities are maintained by colonizing federal policies, case law, and statutes (Image 2).\n\nFigure 2: Logic Model Linking Federal Indian Law to Adverse Health Outcomes\n\nImage source: Hoss, A. (2019). Federal Indian law as a structural determinant of health. Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, 47(S4), 34-42.\n\nFederal policies should promote and support Indigenous cultures, which serve as a preventive and protective factor against colonization and historical trauma for Indigenous children and families and build Indigenous community resilience against adverse health outcomes. Federal policies should reflect what Indigenous Knowledge has known for millennia and what a growing body of research tells us—that an asset-based approach that recognizes culture as a protective and preventive factor improves Indigenous child and family well-being. There are six primary areas of Indigenous cultures linked to protective and preventive results, including 1) enculturation and Indigenous identity formation; 2) traditional activities and games; 3) relationships with the land, including subsistence and traditional foods; 4) social connectedness among family, across generations and with Elders, and with community; 5) Indigenous languages; and 6) spirituality and ceremonies.\n\nIndigenous health and well-being are tied to Indigenous relational perspectives on the natural world, traditional healthy foods, and passing on cultural practices. Subsistence is an important aspect of well-being for Indigenous Peoples and means more than just hunting, fishing, and gathering food. Indigenous Peoples see subsistence as part of spirituality and way of life, and as a way to relate to the natural world and steward it as protectors and keepers while it provides food for survival. Subsistence is intricately related to Indigenous Peoples’ overall sense of well-being, and passing on subsistence practices gives younger generations grounding in their culture (which, in turn, is protective).\n\nFederal Indian Law is an extensive amassing of case law, statues, and policies that legalize past and present colonization and genocidal practices. It is directly tied to health disparities as a structural determinant of health through termination of Tribes, hyperregulation of Indigenous Peoples and citizenship through blood quantum, and removal of Indigenous ownership and access to ancestral sacred lands and waters. At present, Federal Indian Law sustains the U.S. government as a guardian of Indigenous Peoples—able to use plenary power, break treaties, and dictate consultation (a trust responsibility established by treaties)—leading to decisions that inhibit Tribal jurisdiction over their lands and citizens.\n\nUntil the harm caused by Federal Indian Law is addressed, it will continue the genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the United States and its territories. From 1492 to now, it’s estimated that 13 million Indigenous people have died on present-day U.S. lands. As defined by Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, “genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.”\n\nResponse to Question 1: Examples of Federal Policies That Create Racial and Ethnic Health Inequities for Indigenous Communities\n\nIn this section, we outline five ways in which federal policies create health inequities for Indigenous Peoples and negatively impact the community and cultural context for Indigenous children and families. Although we do not provide a comprehensive accounting of all Federal Indian Law, the categories are helpful for organizing the overarching policy issues.\n\nFirst, policies that diminish Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination create health inequities for Indigenous children, families, and communities. Past and present colonization by the United States suppresses the freedom of Indigenous Nations to be self-determining. As Dr. Darlene Sambo Dorough (Iñupiaq Indigenous rights advocate) explained, when “self-determination is denied, the repercussions are felt by its individual members and overall Indigenous communities are destroyed or become vulnerable to destruction.” Self-determination is a right outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Makau W. Mutua, JD emphasized that “The most fundamental of all human rights is that of self-determination … Without this group or individual right, no other human right could be secured, since the group would be unable to determine for its individual members under what political, social, cultural, economic and legal order they would live.”\n\nSelf-determination is a freedom required for well-being and survival, and Indigenous Nations practice it through self-government, subsistence, fate control, freedom, and cultural regeneration and maintenance. When Indigenous Peoples are removed from their traditional lands and food sources, stripped of their identity through assimilation practices, and have their sovereignty limited, these practices lead to a lack of wellness. The well-being of Indigenous children and families is directly impacted by policies that limit self-determination and impede Indigenous Peoples’ access to protective cultural practices (e.g., healthy traditional foods) and ability to provide safe homes and communities. A recent study found that putting decision-making power in the hands of Indigenous Nations to address their own lives is the best way to deal with colonialism, especially as Indigenous Peoples may hold values different from the majority population. Example policy areas in which Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination are diminished include:\n\nPublic Law 83-280 (PL-280), enacted by Congress in 1953, infringes on Tribal sovereignty by granting states concurrent/shared jurisdiction with Tribes over crimes committed on Indian Country/Reservation lands and civil jurisdiction over civil suits arising on Indian Country/Reservation lands filed in Tribal or federal courts. PL-280 has been, and continues to be, opposed by Indigenous Nations due to its failure to recognize and respect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. It is also often cited as a rationale for denying Tribes law enforcement funding, leading to complex legal and safety concerns.\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) diminishes Tribal sovereignty and jurisdiction—for example, by placing limits on Tribes’ ability to prosecute offenders, which then leads to a lack of safety.\n\nPolicies that disproportionately impact voting rights for Indigenous people silence their voices on issues important to the well-being of their children, families, and communities and should be addressed by the federal government. Indigenous populations are more likely to experience barriers to voting, such as poverty and rurality, and to live in states with ongoing efforts to restrict voting rights.\n\nThe U.S. government has broken treaties with Indigenous Nations, which Indigenous Nations continue to honor. The consequences of broken treaties include the taking of additional land, the failure to provide adequate health care and education, and many other issues that affect children and families’ well-being.\n\nSecond, policies that erode Indigenous rights to land stewardship and subsistence damage the relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the natural world and create health inequities by harming food security, the ability to pass on protective cultural ways, and access to healthy traditional foods. Examples of specific policies that erode Indigenous rights to land stewardship and subsistence include:\n\nThe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) removed all but one Alaska reservation and all Alaska Native subsistence rights on state and federal land, which are vital to health and well-being.\n\nThe Alaska Federal Subsistence Board is made up of five federal organizational leaders (historically non-Indigenous) and provides only three spaces for subsistence users. The board’s structure results in Indigenous people being outvoted in all decisions and should be more equitably organized. The current system limits access to subsistence, which is essential for Indigenous spiritual and cultural health, cultural continuity, and access to healthy traditional foods.\n\nThird, policies that reinforce blood quantum are a codification of race and prevent Indigenous people from having unified communities and passing protective cultural ways to future generations. Indigenous people do not see themselves as being a “percentage” Indigenous. This type of external classification conflicts with Indigenous cultures, causes community stratification, and damages well-being. However, federal policies promote or reinforce this idea in many ways. For example:\n\nIndigenous people are the only population in the United States that has their blood degree codified in Federal law. Citizens of federally recognized Tribes get a Certificate Degree of Indian Blood card from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prove their Indigeneity for services from the federal government. Blood quantum leads to community stratification, as people with low blood quantum may not be eligible for Tribal membership; previously, this was not part of Indigenous culture, and marrying across Tribes and adopting people into Tribes was common. Policies that reinforce blood quantum can tear families apart and take away an individual’s identity. Some Indigenous people fear that blood quantum will be used to enact a “paper genocide.”\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) says that Alaska Natives must be at least one-fourth blood quantum to harvest marine mammals and use their products. When an Alaska Native child’s blood quantum is below this threshold due to mixed heritage, the child can watch their parents but not engage in these activities. MMPA is problematic as it prevents cultural transmission and poses food security issues for families who depend on marine mammals for food.\n\nThe Hawaiian Homes Commission Act (HHCA) says that Native Hawaiians must have at least 50 percent Native Hawaiian blood to be eligible for a homestead lease. In addition to facing long waitlists and being awarded land that is not suited for agriculture, lessees can only pass the land on to eligible relatives with at least 25 percent Native Hawaiian blood.\n\nFourth, health care for Indigenous people (part of the federal trust responsibility, codified in the Snyder Act) is chronically underfunded, lacks adequate infrastructure, and is difficult to access, all of which perpetuate grave health inequities for Indigenous children, families, and communities. For example:\n\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) is grossly underfunded, resulting in limited access to care within the diverse areas where Indigenous people live. Approximately 70 percent of Indigenous people live outside of reservation lands, yet only 25 percent of those in urban areas have access to an IHS facility in their county.\n\nIHS underfunding (less funding than Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Affairs per person) results in inadequate facilities and care. This was evident as Indigenous populations died at disproportionate rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn average, IHS facilities are nearly four decades old. Indigenous people are not able to fully benefit from current and emerging health care technology.\n\nIHS should receive advanced appropriations. The Affordable Care Act offered relief to Tribal communities that had previously needed to advocate for increased funding and extended access to health care choices for Indigenous people, but these communities must still expend constant energy to receive additional dollars, rather than simply having it appropriated in the federal budget. IHS should also receive mandatory funding so that government shutdowns do not impact communities’ access to care.\n\nIndigenous families need improved access to standard health care services across the lifespan that are culturally appropriate. Indigenous populations face disproportionately high maternal and infant mortality rates and need additional supports to provide high-quality Elder care.\n\nFifth, chronic underfunding of education (part of the federal trust responsibility)—as well as barriers to federal funding for infrastructure and other services—perpetuate social and economic inequities that contribute to health inequities for Indigenous communities. For example:\n\nThe U.S. Census is known for undercounting Indigenous people, producing inaccurate data on where Indigenous people live and making it difficult to appropriately direct funding to support their well-being. Inadequate data collection results in an incomplete understanding of the range of inequities experienced by Indigenous people and prevents efficient responses to public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal policies should promote the use of best practices in data collection for Indigenous populations.\n\nBureau of Indian Education schools need increased funding to improve facilities and services, retain staff, support culturally grounded learning and evaluation, and promote student success. Increased funding is also needed to support the large number of Indigenous students who are educated in public school systems.\n\nIncreased investments are needed to address the trauma, and loss of culture and language, that resulted from federal boarding schools and assimilation policies. Historically, the federal government poured thousands of dollars into these efforts to extinguish Indigenous languages and cultures, a practice that did not change until the 1990 passage of the Native American Languages Act Public Law 101-477. Matching those funds in today’s dollars to support cultural and language revitalization would promote healing and have long-term impacts on well-being. For example, the Administration for Native Americans funding for Native language revitalization programs could be increased and be noncompetitive.\n\nIn many rural and reservation areas, there is a history of inadequate funding for infrastructure to meet basic needs such as housing, water, sewage and waste, and electricity, as well as technological needs such as fiber/broadband internet and cellphone towers.\n\nCriminal justice is also underfunded and, when mixed with the jurisdictional restrictions noted above, results in public safety issues like the missing and murdered Indigenous relatives crisis. Federal policies that address infrastructure needs in Indigenous communities will also address health inequities faced by Indigenous children and families.\n\nAdditional Resources and Federal Policy Recommendations\n\nMuch work has been done by Indigenous Peoples and the federal government to understand the ways in which policies contribute to health inequities and to develop potential policy solutions. With that existing work in place, we recommend the Committee look to two additional resources to understand some of the key federal policy gaps and areas for necessary implementation support. The first is the National Congress of American Indians’ (NCAI) annual and mid-year resolutions—“one of the policy mechanisms utilized by NCAI to express the consensus positions of member tribes on tribal, federal, state, and/or local legislation, litigation, or policy matters that affect the welfare and rights of American Indian and Alaska Native governments or communities.” Resolutions go into detail on improving implementation of federal grant programs and funding for Tribes (e.g., Calling on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to Permanently Expand Telehealth, Calling on Federal Agencies to Expedite Grant Review and Award Processing for Critical 2022 Tribal Infrastructure Projects, Particularly in Areas with Limited Construction Windows, and In Support Of Expanding Access to Impact Aid for Tribally Controlled Schools), providing federal strategies for supporting Tribal sovereignty and self-determination (e.g., Calling Upon Congress to Recognize a Right of Indigenous Economy and Calling on the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to Respect Tribal Data Sovereignty Regarding Broadband Data in the Broadband Data Collection Portal), describing the ways in which Indigenous culture may both support and be supported by federal policy (e.g., Supporting Tribal Nations’ Innovative Solutions to Drought in the West and Declaring Native American Languages in a State of Emergency and Support for an Executive Order on Native American Language Revitalization), and elevating unique needs and historical injustices of Indigenous children, families, and communities (e.g., Support for a National Native Youth Suicide Prevention Initiative and Entreating a United States Proclamation that a Genocide was Committed on Native Children, Families, and Nation).\n\nIn addition to NCAI’s resolutions, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights published a 2004 report, Broken Promises: Evaluating the Native American Health Care System, which was later updated and expanded in 2018. Many of the recommended changes to federal policy within both reports remain unfulfilled and may be informative to the Committee. In addition to describing the strong connection between the federal government’s broken treaty obligations and Indigenous Peoples’ health, both reports describe how health equity could be supported through federal investments in housing, public safety, education, economic development, core infrastructure, and technical assistance. In particular, the 2018 report provides comprehensive descriptions of the health disparities experienced by Indigenous people, such as lower life expectancies and higher infant mortality and suicide rates, and describes the ways in which federal health care programs fail to fully support the needs of these communities."
