        "text": "Samoa declared independence from New Zealand in 1962, making it the first independent Pacific Island state. The Federal Republic of Germany and the Independent State of Samoa established diplomatic relations ten years later – and in 1988, shortly before the Berlin Wall came down, the German Democratic Republic even followed suit. But the countries’ historical ties go back to the mid-nineteenth century and the German colonial age. It was primarily Hanseatic trading companies that first forged relations with the archipelago. The German Reich and the kingdom of Samoa signed a trade and friendship agreement in 1879. Samoa soon became a pawn in the power struggle between Britain, the United States and the German Reich. The archipelago was divided between the US and the German Reich with the Tripartite Convention of 1899, and Western Samoa came under the control of the German Reich. The German colonisation of Samoa ended with the First World War.\n\nFighting the climate crisis – a key challenge"
