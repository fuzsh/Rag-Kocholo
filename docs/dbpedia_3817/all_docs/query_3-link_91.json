Customers can now resume normal use of the water supply.\n\nThe notice, which was issued on July 29, was put in place to protect the health of customers following the detection of an exceedance of arsenic in the supply.\n\nDrinking water experts from Uisce Éireann worked to lift the notice as quickly and safely as possible and following satisfactory water samples the Do Not Consume notice has been lifted. The customers affected in Ballyogarty, Graigueshoneen, Cooltubrid East and areas of Kilmacthomas including Union Road, Hillside Crescent, Hillside Close and Cruachán View can now use their water as normal.\n\nUisce Eireann’s Maura Phelan commented, “Uisce Éireann would like to thank the residents and businesses who were affected by this notice for their patience and cooperation while it was in place to protect public health. We would also like to thank the community for their support while we worked to lift the notice. Uisce Éireann’s primary focus remains the protection of public health and we worked with our stakeholders to lift the notice as quickly as possible.\n\n“We are grateful to customers, elected representatives and the media for their assistance in sharing information on the Do Not Consume Notice.”\n\nShould customers have any queries regarding the lifting of this notice they can check out the Water Supply Updates section on our website, on X (formerly Twitter) @IWCare and via our customer care helpline, open 24/7 on 1800 278 278. To register as a vulnerable customer or as an alternative contact, visit www.water.ie/vulnerablecustomer.\n\nUisce Éireann is responsible for delivering public drinking water and wastewater services for the people of Ireland.
