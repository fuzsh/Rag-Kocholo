        "text": "This policy aims to facilitate better coordination of climate change work in Samoa and provide opportunities for cooperation and collaboration between the government and all stakeholders. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Samoa shares with other SIDS the characteristics of being economically vulnerable and ecologically fragile because of its geographical location, isolation, limited resources and exposure to global economic crisis. The Samoan Government has made it clear that adapting to climate change impacts will continue to be ‘the major occupation and priority policy determinant for Samoa well into the future’ and that it was ‘an urgent crisis, which dwarfed all others.\n\nThis Policy is intended to be the overall umbrella climate change policy framework providing guidance to government, communities and the private sector on national governance arrangements and actions to enhance effective and ambitious climate action. The eight broad objectives identified for this Climate Change Policy includes: Establish an effective governance framework and support systems in place for effective response to climate change impacts; implement adaptation measures to protect Samoa from the impacts of climate change; implement mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including matters relating to the Nationally Determined Contributions; implement measures to enhance sustainable climate finance; effectively mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation into national planning, implementation and monitoring processes; improve data and information management on climate change for informed decision making; strengthen effective coordination and representation at the national, regional and international level; and promote and implement effective awareness, education and advocacy activities on climate change issues."
