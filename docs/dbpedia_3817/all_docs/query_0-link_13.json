        "text": "On Friday, the 15th df March, the barometer went\n\ndown to 29-10, a sure indication of a heavy blow being\n\nimminent. All the warships in the harbour got steam\n\nup, and made things snug in order to weather the gale,\n\nbut the violence of the wind and sea proved too much\n\nfor them, as the sequel will show, all being driven\n\nashore, eicept the British warship Calliope, which\n\nsteamed out to sea in the very teeth of the storm.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning the gale increased in fury-\n\nwith a fearful sea. enormous waves driving right intti\n\nthe mouth of the harbour, and the wind blowing at the\n\nrate of 80 miles an hour. The night, too, was intensely\n\ndark. When daylight broke the critical nature of the\n\nsituation was at once realised.\n\nThe first to drag and go on the reef was the Eber.\n\nThe heavy sea carried her right on to the top of the\n\nedge of the reef, which she struck about amidships,\n\nand broke in two. She almost immediately went out of\n\nsight. With the exception of one junior ofHoer and\n\nfour seamen, all on board were lost.\n\nThe next to go on the reef was the Adler. She was\n\ncarrie 1 bodily nearly 100ft. to the reef, where she now\n\nlies turned over on one side, a complete wreck. Out of\n\nibe Adlcr'b crew between 20 and 30 were lost. All the\n\nA-fficers weie saved.\n\nShortly after the Adler went ashore the Nipsic was\n\nsei n drigging down towards the south reef, where, if\n\nshe had struck, she would certainly have gone to pieces.\n\nWhen those in command saw she was dragging straight\n\non the reef they ordered the cables to be slipped to\n\nenable them to veer rouud and run her on ths sandy\n\nbeach opposite the D. S. Consulate. It took good\n\njudgment and seamanship to get her into this posi*\n\ntion, as she had very little 6team power, on account of\n\nher funnel being knocked to pieces in collision with the\n\nOlga. All the officers and men were saved, except four\n\nmen who went into the boat that was lowered and cap\n\nsized on striking the water, and three that jumped\n\noverboard were carried away by the current.\n\nBetween 10 and 11 o'clock the Vandalia was seen\n\ndragging towards the same dangerous reef that the\n\nNipsic had just succeeded in getting away from.\n\nWhen she got near the reef she tried to follow the\n\nNipsic's example and get on the sandy beach close to\n\nwhere that vessel lay. It was hoped at one time that\n\nshe would be able to accomplish this, but being a larger\n\nvessel and drawing more water, and the tide being also\n\nmuch lower, she struck a sunken reef and stuck fast.\n\nTerrible seas were breaking over her from stem to stern,\n\nand she gradually settled down during the afternoon,\n\nuntil nothing was visible but her masts and the tops of\n\nher bulwarks. It was a sight which the few people who\n\nsawitwillneverforget. Theriggingwascovered with men,\n\nand the wind, rain, and sea were dashing against them.\n\nA rope was got from the Nipsic to her, and a few got\n\noff that way, but. many found that it was safer to cling\n\nto the mist* There they clung until the flagship came\n\ndown upon them, when most of them got on board her.\n\nThis was at 10 o'clock on Saturday night, so that they\n\nhad been shivering on the rigging for over 12 hours.\n\nThe Vandalia lost her captain and three officers and 36\n\nmen.\n\nDuring the afternoon, when the gale was at its\n\nheight, the Trenton was seen drifting down the harbour\n\ntowards the Calliope and Olga. The Calliope then\n\nslipped her cables, and went out to sea, passing within\n\na few feet of the Trenton. The two crews cheered each\n\nother as the vessels passed.\n\nAlter the Calliope passed, the Trenton came slowly\n\ndown in the direction of the Olga. The captain of this\n\nvessel, seeing a collision was inevitable, owing to the\n\nTrenton's engines being powerless, and the vessel not\n\nunder control, slipped his anchors and beached the\n\nvessel. The Trenton then came on towards the reef,\n\nand it was feared she was going right on the place\n\nwhere the Eber had gone to pieces. Fortunately the\n\nwind changed a little, and by good management with\n\nstorm trysails ehe was guided down along the reef and\n\ngrounded very close to where Vandalia was lying. It\n\nwas nearly dark by this time, and the storm of wind and\n\nrain appeared to be as fierce as ever. The Trenton\n\nseemed to have grounded on a better bottom than the\n\nVandalia, and it was hoped she would hold together\n\nuntil the storm moderated, so that the lives of all on\n\nboard would be saved, if not the ship. This she\n\nfortunately did, and during the night all the men\n\nclinging to the Vandalia's mast got on board the\n\nTrenton. Next morning, when the wind and sea went\n\ndown, the men were all got safely on shore.\n\nWhat a scene of desolation the Apia beach presented\n\non Sunday morning ! The whole foreshore was strewn\n\nwith wreckage as far as one could see. Hundreds of\n\nnatives, sent by Mataafa, did splendid work in saving\n\nlives and assisting in every way they possibly could.\n\nThey made no distinction between Germans and\n\nAmericans, and are certainly deserving of the highest\n\npraise for the brave, unselfish way in which they\n\nacted.\n\nThe Vandalia lost four officers and 39 men — namely,\n\nCaptain Schumaker, Paymaster Armes, Lieutenant of\n\nmarines Sutton, Fayclerk John Roach, Quartermaster\n\nWilliam Brown, and the following seamen: — Henry\n\nBaker, W. Brisbane, ;M. Coshan, M. Craigcn, B. F.\n\nDavis, T. G. Downey, G. Erickson, S. C. Gierney,\n\nAdolph Goldner, George Lohman, N. B. Green,\n\nJoseph Gritfen, E. N. Hammon, John Hanchett, (J. Ii.\n\nHawken9, \\V. Iiowah, F. Jones, G. Jordan, M. H.\n\nJosephs, John Kelly, T. Kelly, D. Kinsella, C. P.\n\nFrazer, C. Kraus, F. Leissiman, L. Merrage. Aylmer,\n\nMontgomery, T. Riley, H. P. Statanez, C. G. Stand\n\nford, John Sims, W. H. Wells, John Welliford, Henry\n\nWickted. Ah Kom, Appack, Pendang, and Tiebor.\n\nThe Nipsic lost seven seamen— namely, George W,\n\nCollan, John Hill, Joshua Heep, T. Johnson, David\n\nKelleher, Henry Pontsell, and W. Watson.\n\nThe officers and erew of the Trenton were all 6aved.\n\nCaptain Schumaker was just about to take to the rig\n\nging, when he was caught by an advancing wave and\n\nswept against a Gatling gun. He was probably severely\n\ninjured, as the same sea carried him overboard, and he\n\nwas drowned in view of all those who remained on the\n\nVandalia.\n\nThe Adler lost the following; — Petty Officer Rashke,\n\nFireman Mingmar, Seamen Fischer, Remus, Aviscus,\n\nMessenger, Loser, Jahrenbirg, Peters, Fischer, Bush,\n\nWeink, Wichelin, Schuegotzky, Janush, Markus,\n\nTonke, Reilar, Blaved, Laurassen. All the Olga' 8\n\nofficers and crew were saved. The Trenton only lost\n\none boy, who was struck by a sea and killed, his skull\n\nbeing smashed.\n\nThe L.ily was cut down at her anchors by the Nipsic.\n\nCaptain Douglas was on board at the rime, as also was\n\nMr. Ormsby, a trader for M'Arthur and Co., and the\n\nschooner's 'cook. The two latter were drowned. A\n\nlittle damage was done to the houses in town. Very\n\nfew bodies 'of those drowned came ashore. According\n\nto the latest accounts only 13 have been recovered.\n\nThe following is a list cf vessels wrecked besides men\n\nof-war : — Peter Godeffroi, barque : Lily, schooner ;\n\nAgur, barquentine; Detnan, cutter; T. Polo, schooner;\n\nUtuanapa, schooner ; Vaiteie, cutter ; Mukunono,\n\nketeh.\n\nH;M.S. Calliope, after the storm, returned to Apia.\n\nShe subsequently left for Sydney.\n\nThe flags at Auckland and Wellington are flying at\n\nhalf-mast.\n\nAUCKLAND, Sunday.\n\nThere are some hopes of getting off the Olga and\n\nNipsic. The former is believed to be very little injured.\n\nThe work, however, will be very costly, and will pro\n\nbably be abandoned. Had the Trenton broken up, the\n\nloss of life must have been fearful, as she had 430 men\n\non board Only five of the fiber's crew were saved, the\n\nremaing 72 going down with the vessel. Those who\n\nreached the shore, after terrible struggles, were Lieu\n\ntenant Golddecker and Seamen Jearurtz, Stein, Gill,\n\nand Eckhardt.\n\nLieutenant Wilson, of the Vandalia, has arrived at\n\nAuckland for the purpose of forwarding despatches lo\n\nWashington. He states that after the vessel struck the\n\ndistance from the shore was not more than 150 yards,\n\nbut the intervening- water was a perfect maelstrom.\n\nCoxswain Hammar, a powerful swimmer, jumped over\n\nboard for the purpose of taking a line ashore, but he\n\nwas drowned before getting 50 yards. He was\n\nfallowed by a seaman named Merrage, also a\n\nstrong swimmer, and a man of fearless courage.\n\nHe was also drowned: A native ashore, tempted by an\n\noffer of a thousand dollars, attempted to reach the\n\nvessel with a line and was drowned. No rocket with a\n\nline could be fired ashore, as everything was so soaked\n\nthat there was no means of lighting a rocket. When\n\nthe Trenton came drifiing past the Vandalia she fired\n\na rocket over the latter vessel, by which means a line\n\nwas passed, and nearly all those on the forerigging suc\n\nceeded in reaching the Trenton. It seems her going\n\nashore' was Owing to the seas getting into the engine\n\nroom and putting d t the tires i\n\nThe American Vessels':\n\nThe flagship Trenton, a wooden corvette, class II.,\n\nwas built at New York in 1875, 3900 tons displacement,\n\nof the following dimensions: — 253ft. long, 48ft.\n\nbreadth, and 20ft. depth of hold; her indicated\n\nhorsepower equalled 3100 horses, and a speed of\n\n13 miles could comfortably be negotiated. Her\n\narmament comprised 11 8in. 8-ton muzzle-loading\n\nguns. The Trenton was full ship-rigged, was one of\n\nthe most powerful and the fastest of the unprotected\n\nvessels in the American navy, and the third largest. She\n\nhad recently been refitted, and was probably more\n\npowerfully armed than the above account show.*, her\n\nguns, it is believed, having been changed lately for\n\nthose of more modern pattern. The same remark\n\napplies to the Vandalia, which was precisely of the\n\nsame rate in the navy as the Trenton, only not as large\n\nnor so powerful by two knots. She was full ship\n\nrigged, was built in 1874 at Boston of wood, a screw\n\nsteamer, 2190 tons register, 216ft. long, 39ft. beam, and\n\n17ft depth of hold ; carried six 9in. 4-ton muzzleload\n\ning and one 8in. 8-ton gun. Her speed, developed\n\nby 1180 indicated horse power was equal to\n\n11 knots per hour. It will thus be seen that\n\nthese two warships were of a high class and of good\n\npower. The third, the Nipsic, equal in power to the\n\nVandalia, but neither so large nor so heavily armed,\n\nwas but nine years old. She was barque-rigged, a\n\nwooden corvette, rate III., built of wood at Washington\n\nin 1878 ; 185ft. long, 35ft. beam, and 14ft. depth of hold,\n\n1380 indicated horse-power, with a speed of 11 knots.\n\nShe carried four 9in. 4-ton muzzle-loading guns, one\n\n8in. 8-ton muzzle-loading gun, and one 60 -pounder.\n\nThe Gkeman Vessels.\n\nH.I.G.M.S. Olga was a high-powered ship-rigged\n\ntwin screw vessel, constructed of iron, and sheathed\n\nwith wood, launched in 1880, and built at Stettin, 2169\n\ntons register, 226ft. long, 41ft. beam, and 16ft. depth\n\nof hold ; her indicated horse power was 2390, and her\n\nspeed was equal to 14 knots per hour. Captain von\n\nErhardt, it is said, was in command, and he had with\n\nhim as officers — Captain Lieutenant Ehrlich, Lieuten\n\nants Emsmann, Schirmer, and Burchard, Dr.\n\nElste, paymaster Mr. Thiedc, engineer Mr. Grose\n\nman, with a crew of 267, including officers.\n\nMany Sydney residents will remember this fine ship\n\nwhen she was last here with the squadron consisting of\n\nthe Bismarck, Sophie, and Carola. Indeed, she was a\n\nsister vessel in all respects to the Carola and Sophie. It\n\nwill be recollected that some of the seamenand one or more\n\nofficers of the German war vessels were killed in an\n\nengagement with the Samoans some time ago, and the\n\nsteamer Lubeck, which left here on the 21st instant, is\n\nthe bearer to Samoa of 30 men to take the places of\n\nthose so lost. She was duo at Apia on Sunday, and is\n\ndue back here on the 11th instant. The next vessel\n\nof importance in the German squadron was the Adler.\n\nH.I.G.M.S. Adler came up to Sydney on August 6,\n\n1887, for a relief crew, which arrived a few days later\n\non board the Hohenstaufen. This crew comprised\n\nLieutenant Oelener and Sub-lieutenants Dahl and\n\nNowak, also 60 seamen, and found but a portion of her\n\nfull complement. The Adler visited here the first time\n\nin February, 1887, when, it may be remembered, she\n\ncame in rattier unexpectedly from a cruise amongst the\n\nislands of the Pacific, and last from Matupi, New\n\nBritain. She had there been punishing the natives of\n\nNew Ireland for the murder of a German trader named\n\nHermann. When the Adler left home she was ex\n\npected to remain in the South Seas for a term of 10\n\nyears, half of her crew to be renewed annually. The\n\nvessel was designed and built at the Government dock\n\nyard, Kiel, and was launched in 1883. Her class is\n\nthat of a composite screw corvette of 886 tons displace\n\nment. Her principal dimensions are: Length, 55*84\n\ncentimetres; beam,' 9*10 centimetres; and depth, 5*53\n\ncentimetres. Her model was an attractive one, with\n\nits cutwater and slightly overhanging: bow,\n\nand her general appearance 6uch as should justify\n\nthe belief of good seagoing qualities. Tne\n\nAdler's rig was that of a barque, and she carried a\n\ngood spread of canvas. Her engines were constructed\n\nat Dantzig, compound surface-condensing, 650\n\nindicated horse power, and guaranteed speed\n\n11 knots. The vessel's full complement of\n\ncrew was 130, inclusive of officers. Her arma\n\nment consisted of four 15-centimetre guns, Krupp\n\nbreechloaders, carrying a shell of about 701b. weight,\n\nand a range of 5000 to 6000 metres. One was mounted\n\nin the topgallant forecastle, affording practically an all\n\nround fire, another on the quarter-deck, and the other two\n\nwere used as broadside guns. In addition to these she had\n\nthree dotchkiss guns, besidessmall arms. Frointhelatest\n\naccounts to hand her crew at the time of the disaster\n\nequalled 127 men; included in that number was Cap\n\ntain Fritze, Captain Lieutenant von Arend, Lieutenants\n\nCaesar Souchon, Oeloner, Dr. Fereszkiewicz, Pay\n\nmaster Szczodrowski, Engineer Goetze, htr officers.\n\nThe Eber was a much smaller boat than the others.\n\nShe carried three guns only, 570 tons register, 700\n\nhorse power, and had a crew of 87 men, including\n\nCaptain Lieutenant Wallis (lately joined), Lieutenants\n\niickardr. Von Erusthausen, Gaedeke, Dr. Machen\n\nhauer, Paymaster Kunze, and Engineer Teuter.\n\nHelp somebody worse off than yourselves, and you\n\nwill find you are better off than you fancied.\n\nIf a man cannot attain to the length of his wishes, he\n\nmay have his remedy by cutting them shorter.\n\nTo have received many wounds may make you a hero\n\nin the eyes of some, while others will regard you as an\n\ninvalid.\n\nWe have received the 39th number of the Picturesque\n\nAtlas of Australasia, containing the continuation of\n\nthe article by Baron Von Mueller on Australian flora,\n\nand papers on the fauna, climate and rainfall, and\n\nfreol-igicdl formation of Australia. There are also the\n\nlir.-t pages of a descriptive article on the mining in\n\ndustry of «he colonies. All of this matter is appro\n\npriately illustrated, the cuts illustrative of the flora\n\nand fauna being especially interesting.
