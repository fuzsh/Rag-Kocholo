        "text": "Funds to improve quality of services for Samoan population\n\nWASHINGTON, 12 May, 2010-Today the World Bank approved a US$20 million zero-interest loan to Samoa to assist with the impact of the global financial crisis. Recovery from the crisis was weakened considerably in the Pacific island nation by the devastating tsunami that hit last year. The budget support provided by the loan will help to revive Samoa's economy following these major external shocks.\n\nSamoa's economy was heavily impacted by the global financial crisis, with a GDP contraction of five percent in FY2008/09, the worst slump in two decades. The effects of the crisis were made worse by last year's tsunami, which killed 143 people, destroyed infrastructure, and heavily impacted the country's crucial tourism industry. A budget deficit of around 10 percent of GDP is projected for FY2009/10. The impacts have been felt the hardest by the poorest in the country. The loan will help to restore livelihoods and mitigate the rise in poverty.\n\n\"The Government of Samoa and the World Bank are committed to driving economic recovery in the country,\" says Ferid Belhaj, Country Director for Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea & the Pacific Islands at the World Bank. \"Last year's tsunami was the worst natural disaster to hit Samoa since it gained independence, dimming the prospects for a quick recovery from the global financial crisis. These funds will protect the country's most vulnerable people and help facilitate economic growth.\"\n\nThe funds will support the Government of Samoa in reducing the impact of the global financial crisis and the tsunami on the Samoan people. Assistance will go towards immediate reconstruction needs that have emerged due to the tsunami and protecting the delivery of health and education services to the population.\n\nThe funds are being mobilised through the International Development Association's Crisis Response Window, which was set up in 2009 to assist some of the world's poorest countries in developing programs to manage the social and economic impacts of the financial crisis.\n\nThe World Bank more than doubled its assistance to Samoa to US$40 million over three years following the tsunami. This budget support financing follows the approval last week of an additional US$3 million to assist with health needs in the country.\n\nContacts:\n\nIn Sydney\n\nAleta Moriarty +61 2 9235 6545\n\namoriarty@worldbank.org"
