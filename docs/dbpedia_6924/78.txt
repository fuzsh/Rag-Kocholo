Euphonix congratulates artists Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Antonio Dixon, James Newton Howard, and Hans Zimmer on winning music’s highest honor, the Grammy, during Sunday night’s ceremony held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

Corea and Burton won a Grammy for the best Jazz Instrumental Album by an Individual or Group, for their artful collaboration, The New Crystal Silence, recorded at the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall in conjunction with the Sydney Symphony on a Euphonix System 5 digital mixing system.

Dixon took home a Grammy in the Best R&B Album category for his work for Jennifer Hudson’s self-titled album, and when working at Anonymous Entertainment, his Los Angeles-based studio, he uses a Euphonix System 5-MC with high-speed EuCon protocol to control Pro Tools and Logic.

On the road, he uses Euphonix Artist Series media controllers with an Apple MacBook Pro.

Additionally, longtime Euphonix owners James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer won a Grammy for the “Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media” for their original score for The Dark Knight.

Newton Howard, who has also been nominated for an Academy Award for his poignant score in the World War II movie Defiance, recently upgraded his Santa Monica, California studio to a four-core, 310-channel Euphonix System 5.

Zimmer creates his world-class mixes using two Euphonix System 5 digital mixing systems installed at his Remote Control Productions, also based in Santa Monica.

“Our sincerest congratulations to all these talented artists on their Grammy wins,” said Martin Kloiber, Euphonix CEO. “Euphonix is honored to know that our products, technology and innovations helped these very talented gentlemen attain such industry esteem and accolades.”
