        "text": "Greetings from The Temp Track on the Road! A three-day road trip to my parents new house some 1200 miles from Temp Track plaza provided me with plenty of time to evaluate the scores of all eight Batman feature films. Now, some of you might be confused by that number…eight. Well, here, fearless citizen, are the eight films under consideration:\n\nBatman (1966, Leslie H. Martinson)\n\nBatman (1989, Tim Burton)\n\nBatman Returns (1992, Tim Burton)\n\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993, Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm)\n\nBatman Forever (1995, Joel Schumacher)\n\nBatman & Robin (1997, Joel Schumacher)\n\nBatman Begins (2005, Christopher Nolan)\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008, Christopher Nolan)\n\nBasically, if it was released in theatres, I’m considering it here.\n\nUnfortunately, the hoped for information about the third Nolan film was not released at Comic-Con this past weekend, but it has been confirmed that the third film will start shooting in April of next year with a release date of July of 2012. So, even though it’s not much, we do know that it is a go.\n\nDespite this lack of new information, it is still well that I tackle this list this week for I have been reunited with my comic book collection. There isn’t enough room at my current residence for the collection (especially my beloved Fantastic Four collection) so it has lived with my parents and was moved with them a month ago to a place even further away from me. But they are none the worse for wear and after spending a few hours checking the boxes and putting things in order, my collection has established its new home.\n\nBut enough reflection on my geekdom. Onto the five best Batman scores. This time in countdown form. Now, I know I’m going to make some people upset with this list, so I’ll just say sorry up front.\n\n#5: Batman Begins (Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard) – The first score for the Nolan films, it introduced a new sound to the Caped Crusader’s universe and gave us a modern score for the films. Zimmer/Howard gave us a score that eschews the heroic themes of Danny Elfman or Eliot Goldenthal’s scores and one based more on short motives and focused much more on sound. It is almost minimalistic at times and the Batman music sounds like the old 1960s tv series theme passed through electronic filters and reflected through the lens of late 20th Century aesthetics. It was a new sound for a new kind of Batman film.\n\n#4: Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (Shirley Walker) – I’ve gushed about Shirley Walker’s Animated Series scores before on this site, and Mask of the Phantasm extended all that was good about them into the theatrical realm. With the increased budget of a larger film, Walker added a chorus to the mix and even a 90s-tastic pop song, “I Never Even Told You,” performed by Tia Carrere. Yes, that Tia Carrere, aka the Hot Girl from Wayne’s World. Whatever happened to her?\n\n#3: Batman Forever (Eliot Goldenthal) – The Joel Schumacher era of the Batman franchise is dark time for Bat-fans, but one bright light of the films were Goldenthal’s scores. They took the dark, gothic sound of the Burton/Elfman films and made it to fit the over-saturated, pop world of Schumacher’s Gotham. And I also love some of Goldenthal’s track titles, especially “Nygma Variations,” “Batterdammerung,” and “Fledermausmarschmusik.” The Batman & Robin is a bit of a mixed bag, though, as much of the music seems to be recycled from Forever without much change, and I’m hard pressed to find new themes for Mr. Freeze or Poison Ivy. But for as bland as Batman & Robin is in terms of new music, Forever is a score that fresh and innovative, but also respectful for the Elfman scores that came before it.\n\n#2: Batman Returns (Danny Elfman) – This is where people might get angry with me. I selected this over Elfman’s original score, and then decided to put Begins on the list instead of Batman. Well, here is my reasoning. First, I simply like Returns more than the original. I like the children’s chorus and Christmas feeling to the score. Second, I love the Penguin’s theme. One of the things about the original Batman score is that there is no Joker theme. Go back and listen, there is tons of Batman music, snippets of “Beautiful Dreamer,” but no Joker theme. The waltz music can be said to be associated with him, not to mention many of the Prince songs, but still, no Joker theme. This is what you get with Returns, some great villain themes…especially the Penguin. Don’t get me wrong, I love the Batman score, and Danny should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his efforts, but alas, I was only 9 at the time and had no power over the Acamdey…and I still don’t. If anything, my #2 here should be combined Batman and Batman Returns, but I decided not to take the coward’s way out. Lastly, if you haven’t already, go order this right now.\n\n#1: The Dark Knight (Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard) – Two words: Joker Theme. Okay, two more words: electric cello. Seriously, in one, distorted note Zimmer establishes an entire character. One beautiful, distorted, note. That alone is an achievement, but to then weave that note in an out of the score so effortlessly, never let it feel old or repetitive, and never losing the menace established at the beginning of the film is nothing short of brilliant. From that note, he builds a theme that is in many ways the evil foil of the Batman music established in the first film, full of strange accents and a dark, falling chord motif. It is a score fit for what might go down as the best superhero film ever made.\n\nWell, there you have it, love it or hate it. I know this post is a bit lighter on content then some of my recent ones, but please forgive me, I’m on vacation. Hopefully next week I’ll give you a revised list of the Star Trek film scores, but as I’ll just be getting back home on Thursday, I might be a bit late in posting. Hope you have a good week ahead, and while these might not be the scores you deserve, they are the scores you need.\n\nWell, another Friday is upon us, the end of the work week and the beginning of my much overdue summer vacation – but do not be fearful, I shall update from the road. It’s been quite the week here high atop Temp Track Plaza for it seems that my two posts from the weekend – one on Inception and other about the trailer for The Social Network – struck a chord with Google searches the world over and every record this humble blog had for daily, weekly, and monthly views have tumbled like the Berlin Wall c. 1989.\n\nBut never one to rest on my internet laurels, I have been hard at work this week in preparation for today’s edition of Film Score Friday Top 5. And this week we are tackling film score albums by Temp Track favorite Michael Giacchino. Mr. Giacchino has had quite a run of success lately, as chronicled elsewhere in this internet space. He released four film scores last year along with continuing work on Lost and Fringe. Oh, and he won a duffle-bag full of awards for his score to Up. So, it seems that now would be a good time to look back at his still young career and give you a list of five Giacchino scores you should not be without, along with some thoughts on the rest.\n\nIn all, Giacchino has scored 17 films (that is including the end credit music for Cloverfield, the only score in the film), and ten of those can easily be had from your local iTunes store – with the exception of the deluxe edition of Star Trek. (A list of his credits can be seen here.) Of the remaining seven, the CD for Sky High doesn’t really have much of his music, and The Muppet Wizard of Oz has other music on the release, not to mention the disc is out of print, and the rest I can find no trace of. Thusly, the scores under consideration here are as follows: The Incredibles, The Family Stone, Mission: Impossible III, Ratatouille, Cloverfield, Speed Racer, Star Trek (both the original and deluxe release), Up, Land of the Lost, and Earth Days.\n\nSo, here in no real order, and the five Giacchino scores you should have in your collection.\n\nThe Pixar Films: This kinda goes without saying, but I’ve gona and said it anyway. The Incredibles was Giacchino’s first major studio work and really brought him to the attention of the rest of Hollywood. That was back in 2004, and was released just as a little show called Lost was in its early days. Of course, J.J. Abrams knew him from Alias, but Incredibles, with its wonderful ’60s jazz/James Bond score made many people sit up and take notice. Prior to this, he had only four other films scores, none really notable, a number of video games credits, and his work with Abrams to his name. Also, think that with the long development process of animated films, Giacchino was most likely brought on board as even more of a real unknown. Ratatouille (2007) brought Giacchino his first Oscar nomination and features the composers signature wit and style. That style and his ability to adapt to fit any genre and do so in a charming manner has helped make his a stable of the Pixar word. This was further demonstrated with Up (2009), for which composed a score that is nostalgic and wistful, a signature of his work. Even Incredibles can be seen in this manner, a throw back ’60s style score. But what he captures in the scores is what can be described as the Pixar magic. That thing that makes these films not only enjoyable for kids, but for adults also. More importantly, though, each one of these score albums are well done and gives one a great sense of the film and scope of Giacchino’s music. As a bonus, the purchase of Up from iTunes includes a short video interview with the composer about scoring the film.\n\nSpeed Racer (2008) – This film, directed by the Wachowski Brothers (they of The Matrix fame), was a much overlooked, CGI-in-overdrive live action film that was in and out of theatres faster than you could say, “Go, Speed Racer, go!” I’ve mentioned the film before, and I’ll state once again that I believe it is vastly underrated because people were viewing it in the wrong way. Go in with an open mind and some Dramamine and you might actually find yourself enjoying it. As for Giacchino’s score, it pays its respects to the themes and sounds of the original anime series, but also features much of the Giacchino flare. It revels in the impossibility of it all, from the fighting and flying cars to the evil corporations ruining sports…okay maybe not all of it is so impossible. Best of all, every cue feels fresh and different from much of his other work. Where sometimes, after listening to many of his scores, you’ll hear elements of some of his other work (mostly Lost), Speed Racer stays true to its world and is a great ride from beginning to end. Since I first picked up this score over a year ago, it has rarely left my iPod’s rotation, and I can think of no better compliment given my Nano’s 8GB capacity. And speaking of paying homage…\n\nStar Trek: The Deluxe Edition (2009): I recently reviewed this, so I’ll just summarize my thoughts here. First, do yourself a favor and if you haven’t bought either the Deluxe version just released or the original, just splurge for the deluxe. As an album, it holds together much better and gives you a much better feel for the breadth of Giacchino’s music for the film. It also gives a listener familiar with all the Trek scores a sense that Giacchino is calling back to not just the music of the original series, but music from all of the franchise’s history. It is a great score, and a great set. In my opinion, some of the composer’s best film work.\n\nThe Best of the Rest: Should you have some extra credits lying around, I would also recommend pick up “Roar!” from Cloverfield. It is a twelve-minute long shout out to Akira Ifukube’s Godzilla scores that is featured during the film’s end credits (as the film proper has no score), and at 99 cents, you have no excuse. You might also consider checking out Land of the Lost, if only to hear Giacchino references to Jerry Goldsmith’s classic Planet of the Apes score. It has some nice moments in it, though a few times towards the end it veers a bit too close to some of his slow Lost cues.\n\nNow, as a special bonus for those who have made it this far, I offer you a list of my top five favorite Giacchino cue titles. I know some people don’t like his humorous titles, but I for one enjoy them. And away we go…\n\n5. “World’s Worst Last 4 Minutes to Live” from Mission: Impossible III\n\n4. “Galaxy’s Worst Sushi Bar” from Star Trek: The Deluxe Edition\n\n3. “52 Chachki Pickup” from Up\n\n2. “End Credits Can Suck It!” from Land of the Lost\n\nand coming it at number 1…”Matter? I Barely Know Her!” from Star Trek: The Deluxe Edition\n\nWell, that’s it for this week folks. I hope you tune in next week for my countdown of the Batman feature film scores (all eight of them…”Eight?” you ask, you’ll have to come back next Friday to find out). This weekend is the yearly San Diego ComicCon and hopefully there’ll be some news on the next Bat film slated for a July 2012 release – like a title, casting…please? – so no better time than now to look back on the franchise. So come back next week…same Bat-time, same Bat-station.\n\nIt’s rare that a trailer really makes my ears perk up except in the case of trying to identify what score they’re stealing the music from. But every now and then, there is a trailer that is a well done melding of music and image that is a piece of art in and of itself. The first Inception trailers did that, as did the first Watchmen trailer (going all the way back to my first real post on this blog). Well, as I was sitting in the theatre on Saturday anxiously awaiting my 10:50 AM (yes, I like the cheap matinees) screening of Inception to start, the trailer for David Fincher’s (he of Alien3, Fight Club, Se7en, and most recently The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fame) latest film came up – The Social Network. The film is about the creating and founding of Facebook, mildly interesting, but the trailer…well watch it first and then let’s talk.\n\nWhen I first saw it, it took me a bit to identify the song used, but after a minute I recognized Radiohead’s “Creep,” but in a, for lack of a better phrase, hauntingly beautiful choral arrangement. And despite everything that I talked about in yesterday’s post about Inception, that song also stuck in my ear and I finally had to look it up. It is done by a Belgian girls choir called (confusingly) the Scala & Kolacny Brothers. But that’s not what I really want to talk about, I want to parse the trailer itself, because when a song is used well in a trailer, such as it is here, it pays to take about how it is used. For me, it helps to identify why I had a particular reaction to the audiovisual content.\n\nFirst, the song itself. “Creep” was Radiohead’s breakout hit in 1993 (though first released the year before) that brought them to the attention of the alternative rock scene. It features an interesting chord progression for the verses, G major – B major – C major – C minor, that – for me – is one of the most interesting features of the song. The arrangement itself is fairly standard, with a falsetto bridge by Thom Yorke being one of the few defining features, along with Jonny Greenwood’s guitar crushes leading into the chorus. If you don’t know the song, just type it into YouTube and you’ll get numerous videos.\n\nThe choral arrangement featured in the trailer strips the rock instrumentation down to a lonely piano to provide a gently rocking, chordal accompaniment to the choir vocals (click here for a full video of their performance). The overall effect is hard to put into words. It helps to emphasize the lyrics, gives it a quasi-religious overtone, but also evokes the feel of piano artists like Ben Folds or Elton John or Billy Joel. Also, acoustically, there is something about the nature of the range between the register of the choir voices and the piano and the differences of the timbre that gives it a space that also reinforces a quality of hearing a performance in a cathedral. Further…there is an almost collegiate glee club quality to the fact that it is a simple choir and piano arrangement fitting with the film’s Harvard University setting. In and of itself, it a beautiful arrangement and performance, but when it is melded with the images of the trailer, it takes on new levels of meaning.\n\nBut how is the song itself manipulated? How are the lyrics used and interpreted? Well, for the trailer, they begin the song with the second verse and proceed into the bridge, but then cut off at the end of the bridge to allow for some final dialogue and then end with the last line of the final chorus. The lyrics as heard in the trailer (with famous radio edit of “very” instead of “fucking”) are:\n\nI don’t care if it hurts\n\nI want to have control\n\nI want a perfect body\n\nI want a perfect soul\n\nI want you to notice\n\nWhen I’m not around\n\nYou’re so very special\n\nI wish I were special\n\nBut I’m a creep\n\nI’m a weirdo\n\nWhat the hell am I doing here\n\nI don’t belong here\n\nShe’s running out the door\n\nShe’s running out\n\nShe run, run, run, run\n\nRun\n\nI don’t belong here.\n\nI would hope that it is fairly evident from the editor’s careful lyric selection why this song was chosen, but I’ll go ahead and put in my thoughts.\n\nThe first two stanzas used are played against a montage of Facebook like screens: pictures, images of mouse cursors, status updates, etc. Each scene of the montage is related in some way to the lyric itself. For example “I want a perfect body” as we see an athlete after finishing a raise and a woman in a bathing suit climbing out of a pool, both examples of “a perfect body.” Then for “I want a perfect soul” as we see a wedding photo and the picture of a just born infant (prominently featured the “soles” of his feet…a bit punny for my tastes). The large implication of the two pictures is that of a wedding as a merging of two souls and that of a just born human soul. The bigger picture of this verse being selected is a commentary on the whole idea of a “social network.” The idea that all of our lives are so special that it warrants status updates and such informing friends and whoever what we are doing minute to minute (in my case, today announcing that I was getting an oil change…spread the news!).\n\nThe song is about longing for inclusion in a group, but eventual exclusion, “I don’t belong here,” because they’re a creep, a weirdo. The somewhat voyeuristic first four lines of the second verse, someone longing for someone else’s life, body and soul, contrasted with their own sense of loneliness in their longing (in the second stanza) for someone, anyone, to notice when they are not there, is exactly the nature of Facebook, MySpace, and other social networking sites. We want to be noticed, we feed off it. Even blogging is a facet of this need for attention and validation of one’s life.\n\nThe last two lines of the verse, “You’re so very special / I wish I were special,” play as a digitized photo of actor Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg comes into focus. Implying, possibly, that he created Facebook out of his own loneliness and fears, something that is somewhat hinted at in the scene that follows in the trailer as the song segues into the chorus. He explains his wanting to do something so that he would be invited into one of Harvard’s exclusive clubs (this is a Harvard thing, like fraternities and sororities…but more Ivy League).\n\nThe balance of the trailer is a standard montage of scenes to give the audience a sense of the film’s plot, but are edited quite well to follow the pace of the song, especially as it moves into the soaring falsetto bridge (“She’s running out the door,” etc.). The final “I don’t belong here,” is heard as the film’s title and logo, in a Facebook style, is seen. A wonderful juxtaposition of meaning, a statement about exclusion against an image of modern society’s ultimate expression of inclusion.\n\nA wonderfully made trailer that has made me interested to see the film itself. Hopefully it won’t let me down like Watchmen did.\n\nThis is a hard post to write. On the one hand, my head is still swirling with thoughts about Inception, but most are related to the film itself and its structure. I’ve fully absorbed the music and I’ve seen the film, but I’m still trying to synthesize the two into a complete whole. The film itself is layers upon layers upon layers…upon layers. There is the heist movie cliché of the old thief doing this one last job to settle old debts/scores/whatever so that he can finally retire. It’s a film about reality versus dreams, and the uncanny nature of reality and memory and dreams…and the unreliability of it all. It’s both summer action and a mediation on life and love and regrets…and how they can haunt us even while we dream…especially when we dream.\n\nSPOILER ALERT!!!!! If you haven’t seen the film, you might want to wait to read on until you do. Don’t worry, it’ll still be here waiting for you.\n\nIn many ways, what is referred to as “inception” in the film – the planting of a new idea into a mind in the hopes that the dreamer will accept it as their own – is like how Nolan constructs many of his films. He shows you something right from the beginning, usually something key to the plot, if not THE key, but then leaves it. Lets it worm into the viewer’s mind and allows them to try and figure it out. He might return to it in flashes, but not always. He might show it from some different angels, but not always. But no matter how he does it, it’s there, just waiting to be explained. The Batman films aren’t as explicit about it, but do it to some degree, but Insomnia, The Prestige, and now Inception all follows this model much more closely – Following and Memento do so also, but not as well, I think Nolan was still honing his craft. In Insomnia, it was the image of blood seeping into cloth and for Prestige it was a forest full of top hats. With Inception, it opens with Leonardo DiCaprio’s character Dom Cobb washing up on a beach, meeting with an old man and spinning a top (something that was also part of the film’s early, cryptic website).\n\nI have the sense that in all three of the aforementioned films that musically the composers (David Julyan for the first two, now Hans Zimmer) have tried to achieve something similar. The Julyan scores are a bit harder to get a handle one, especially Prestige…so I’ll leave those for later and lets focus on Hans’ latest and greatest.\n\nThe first cut on the album, “Half Remembered Dream” actually begins while the logos and are on the screen. It’s the first time since Batman Begins that a Nolan film hasn’t opened in almost utter silence (and even Begins was only a “sound” of wings flapping). As I mentioned in my first post, this cue introduces us to two of the main thematic ideas of the score. The first is a four note motive that has a few different harmonic settings and weaves in and out of the score and the second is what I shall call “the trombones from hell” even though I know there are more than just trombones being played. But…eh.\n\nLet’s pull apart that opening track for a moment because it does something very interesting. The four-note motive is basically a pair of ascending perfects fifth a half-step apart. Most often heard as C-G-B-F#, which means that it ends exactly a tri-tone away from the first note. In music theory terms, that F# is exactly equidistant away from both a higher and lower C and musically doesn’t really have a logical resolution. If the F# had come from C, we would want it to resolve up to the G, but instead it’s coming from a B, so we could hear it as merely the fifth of B. There are two conflicting tonalities built into the motive that are never resolved because the four notes simply fold back to the beginning like the never-ending staircase that is one of the visuals present in the film. But there are variations, at times of great stress, occasionally the motive will change to C-B-B (an octave lower)-F#, heightening the tension and maybe emphasizing the B more, but no, it loops back around to C again. It is also heard, the first version followed by the second and then back to the first. So C-G-B-F#-C-B-B-F#-C-etc.\n\nBoth of these versions are present in the opening track and are also the versions most heard in the film, but there is another transposed version heard only once (at least that I’m sure of, explained later)…at the very beginning of the first cue over the first logo. This version is the motive, but transposed down a fifth to begin on F: F-C-E-B. This is followed in the cue by the first appearance of the trombones from hell that will soon become the most iconic part of the score. After that cacophony subsides though, we get the motive again, but now in the soon to be familiar C version and then followed by the second variant with the high B, though the final F# is not played (at least on the album, I’ll have to see the film again to confirm that is how it plays out, again see below for more).\n\nGiven that the trombones are most associated with the dream world itself, could this cue during the logos be our movement into the dream world of the film – one that we never come out of? Unless the motive starting on F is heard again at the end of the closing credits…which is possible. More research is required. It’s actually plausible that Hans does play this game because towards the end of the credit the French song that I mentioned as being present in track ten of the album (“Waiting for a Train”) comes back. This song, “Non, je ne regrette rien” (No, I regret nothing), is an important plot device in the film, and I would like to talk a little about it because it shows just how cagey a director Christopher Nolan is.\n\nThis song is best known in a 1960 recording by singer Edith Piaf. This is notable on a few levels. First, in the recent biopic about Piaf, La Vie en Rose, the song is used in the final sequence when Piaf is signing it for the first time as her death is also shown via parallel editing. Now, as many other reviews have mentioned, Dom Cobb’s wife (who is dead when the film begins) is played by Marion Cotillard, who portrayed Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose. Layers upon layers. Some may think that it is a cute inside reference, but given how the song as used in Inception as a cue that it’s time to get out and also for Dom is a reference to his dead wife – who still haunts his subconscious for reasons slowly explained in the film – I believe it’s more than an inside joke. It was a cagey move on the part of Nolan about how dreams can work, how the outside world can intrude and infect them, as shown in the film when a character is dunked in water in a higher level and it starts flooding in the lower dream. It could be that in reality that Dom’s wife looked nothing like Marion Cotillard, but because, for him, that she is associated with the song, which is linked to Piaf’s death in La Vie en Rose, she has come to look like her in his dreamscape. Layers upon layers upon layers.\n\nThe song itself is used as a cue for those inside the dreams to get ready to leave. The person’s whose dream it is has headphones placed on them which are connected to an mp3 player with the song. Then the song itself emerges into that dream, so it is in this capacity that it is heard throughout the film. And in the end credits, if one stays long enough, it is heard towards the very end, right before a final statement of the four note motive…I think. I wasn’t listening as intently this morning becuase I was just getting a sense of the film.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I’ve actually put most of these thoughts together while typing this post. The very act of writing has helped me to sort some of this out…and I have one more thought for you, loyal reader.\n\nOn the album, the first and last tracks end much the same way, with the sound being, in effect, choked off. It’s actually not unlike an effect used in The Prestige, but that is for another time (are you watching closely?). This sound could indicate a second level movement in the dream space. If the first sound choke occurs right after the logos (which I can’t remember exactly) it could be our movement into the dream space of the film. And as the sound occurs again at the very end before the credits, it is also our movement out. So the film itself could be seen as a dream within a dream. First is our movement into our dream space (represented by the modulation via trombones from hell of the four note motive) and then via the sound choke into the dream space of the film, which can be seen as Dom’s dream. In this sense, then, the music of the credits, if the motive does indeed move back into the “home” F version after the last occurence of the Piaf song, moves us back into reality.\n\nI guess all the people who left before the end of the credits are stuck forever in limbo. (See the movie to understand that)\n\nI’ve spent most of this time on the finer technical details of music’s use in the film, ignoring the bigger picture ideas of how the music conveys the sense of the film. I addressed that, in part, via my earlier posting, but it would help to reiterate that the music really does help to convey the sense of dreams. From the “dreamy” guitar licks to the trombones from hell, everything is either amped up or slowed down to some sort of extreme, and the most pedestrian cue, “Mombasa,” occurs, ostensibly, in the real world of the film’s characters – though the levels of reality in the film are open to debate.\n\nIn conclusion, Zimmer’s score for Inception is a multi-dimensional work that, to an astute listener, is an integral part of the film, as is the Piaf song “Non, je ne regrette rien.” They both assist in Nolan’s execution of the film which is a fitting conclusion to what can be seen as a trilogy of film meditating on the nature of reality and illusion: Insomnia, The Prestige, and Inception. And these films also furthered themes present in Nolan’s first films, Following and Memento. It is well-known that his next project with be the conclusion of his Batman trilogy and it will be interesting to see where the filmmaker and his team go from there. Here’s hoping that Zimmer is along for the ride.\n\nA few weeks ago I posted a list of influential sci-fi scores, going back the heady days of the 1950s with scores like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Forbidden Planet. Today I propose to stay a bit closer to the present day and discuss science fiction films since 2005. For this, though, I am going to expand on the rather restrictive definition of science fiction from the previous list. Mainly, I want to go with the broader classification of “speculative fiction.” Here, I’m not purely restricting to stories set in space or in alternate, dystopian futures but rather an sort of speculation past, present, or future about the world in which we live and its technology. So t in doing research in assembling this list, I considered stories set in the past with speculative technologies (sometimes called steampunk, though even that is a more specific term that what I was considering), or even ones not clearly based in technology but rather treading that thin line between fantasy/sci-fi/drama and just about everything else. All of this is to say that I cast a wide net in deciding on my five, and in the interest of full disclosure, I’ll actually list everything I’ve been listening to at the end of the post.\n\nThe other major criterion I had when making my choices was that it truly contributed something to the genre. Not the film itself, but the score brought something to the table that helped to push the dialogue of “what is sci-fi music?” further. As I mentioned in the previous list, the genre is one with little in the form of true “conventions” that can be stated as the prototypical sci-fi sound or style. I think part of reasons for this is that sci-fi combines with so many other genres and depending on what that other genre might be will help determine some of the approach. Science fiction is more than just a “genre,” it is a setting in which a whole slew of stories can take place. From the sci-fi thriller/suspense of Alien to the sci-fi action of Total Recall. Or from sci-fi drama/fantasy/epic of Star Wars to sci-fi noir of Blade Runner and Dark City. All of these films are “science fiction” but scoring choices were made to serve both the “science fiction” element and the other half of the genre equation. If we ask what a “pure” science fiction score (or even film for that matter) might sound like, I’m not sure I could answer that question. This is part of what I don’t like about Timothy Scheurer’s treatment of science fiction in his book Music and Mythmaking in Film: Genre and the Role of the Composer. While I agree with many of his premises, I think he over-simplifies many aspects of the genre in order to generate a succinct, codified theory. Science fiction is a wonderfully diverse and rich genre with scores to match and I hope this list reflects this diversity.\n\nIn Chronological Order…\n\nChildren of Men – John Tavener, et al (2006): This is a strange “score” because it’s not really a score in the traditional sense. It is part compilation score, filled with pre-existing Tavener works, pop/rock songs, Handel, Mahler, Penderecki, and others, and part new score because Tavener wrote a new piece for it. This piece, Fragments of a Prayer, is a sort of touchstone for most of the film’s score and comes back throughout the film. Taken as an aesthetic whole, the soundscape, musical and sound design, of Children of Men is a triumph in and of itself and that the film is also great makes the finished project one of the best science fiction films of the last decade, maybe even in the history of the genre. The fact that the score is a hybrid of pre-existing music and a piece composed for the film, but also an independent work, might conjure up thoughts of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but what Cuaron did in assembling is score is not really what Kubrick did. Kubrick had a score written by Alex North but decided (rightly or wrongly, I have yet to compare them) that his temp score best fit his vision of the film. Cuaron and his team were inspired by the music of Tavener during the writing process and decided that his music fit the tone of the film (which is does to beautiful and heartbreaking effect) and rather than have someone try to imitate it made the choice to approach Tavener about being involved with the project. Thankfully to film and film music fans everywhere, the composer said yes.\n\nSunshine – John Murphy and Underworld (2007): A joint score written by two frequent collaborators of director Danny Boyle, Sunshine is the story of a crew on a mission to restart the dying sun. The composers devised two main thematic ideas for the score, one of which – “Adagio in D Minor” written by Murphy – is one of my favorite film themes of recent memory. Underworld, an electronic music outfit, contributed a contrasting theme that is more hopeful and could be said to represent the promise of a reborn sun. The composers collaborated on multiple tracks (or at least are listed as co-composers of five of the album’s nineteen tracks) and can be said to have contributed equally to developing the sound of the score. Equal parts orchestral and electronic and at times verging on noise and pure sound, the score helps to counterpoint the crew of the Icarus II’s striving against terrible odds and ordeals to complete their mission. (On a side note, while this is one of my favorite sci-fi films of the past decade, I do have some issues with the last act of the film…almost turns into a slasher film after being a taut, psychological thriller for the first two acts.) The score has some minimalistic elements with static chords, repeating rhythms, and other elements, but in the end, it is very distinctive and fits in with the film’s visuals almost perfectly.\n\nBabylon A.D. – Atli Örvarsson (2008): This is probably the weakest entry on the list, but in the final analysis I decided to include it because while the film itself is not great (though not as bad as some reviewers would have it…which might just be the nicest thing anyone has said about the movie), I find the score compelling on a numerous levels. I want to do a more in-depth analysis of the score – though I haven’t had the time to prepare that post yet – but I almost feel like not all of the material from the score album is even included in the film. What I find intriguing are the inclusion of the texts for the Agnus Dei and Dies Irae from the traditional Catholic mass, the former as a theme for the girl Aurora and the latter seemingly paired with the Noelite Church that is ostensibly the antagonist of the picture…though this is very poorly explained in the film, just one of its main problems. And on the album, there seems to be more material with the Dies Irae in it than can be heard, which indicates to me that some footage was cut out or moved around or something. The score itself is fairly typical of what comes out of Remote Control Group, for which Örvarsson works, a blending of electronic sounds and beats with orchestral tones over it. But the voices echoing throughout the score singing about the lamb of God or the day of wrath help to bring out the religious overtones that were seemingly lost in either a poor script or in the editing room…or both.\n\nMoon – Clint Mansell (2009): Well, you had to have known this would be on the list since I named it the best score of 2009, and everything I said then still applies. From the hypnotic opening track of “Welcome to Lunar Industries” to the mournful “Memories (Someone We’ll Never Know),” Clint Mansell’s score captured Sam Bell’s journey of madness, discovery, and escape in a way that helped to root the film in the essential humanity of the character. I’m not sure if Mansell is doing Duncan Jones next film – Source Code – but I hope so as their first collaboration produced such wonderful results. And speaking of Mansell, I would be derelict in my duties if I did not mention his score for Darren Aronofsky’s The Fountain (2006). That score almost made this list (and I guess it now has), but mainly I left it out to avoid having two scores from the same composer in the main five. The film itself is a challenging one to classify as it’s not strictly sci-fi, though it can be more or less depending on how you interpret the film’s story. It is a beautiful score that I would recommend checking out.\n\nInception – Hans Zimmer (2010): I will mainly point you to my comments in the post prior to this one and my fuller review that will come after I’ve seen the film, but Zimmer’s score here knocked me out when I first heard it and even now, after about six listens in forty-eight hours, still holds my attention. I’ll leave further comment for later.\n\nSo as I said above, I did quite a bit aural research while compiling this list. As soon as I came up with the topic, Moon, Sunshine, and Children of Men immediately came to mind because not only are they three of the best science fiction films of the last five years, they are also three of my favorite scores of the last five years. But I ran into trouble trying to fill in the last two slots. I was hoping that Inception would fulfill on the promise of the music in the initial trailers, but that was no guarantee. Further, I was initially only going to cover the last five years (which ironically I did end up doing), but I expanded the period back to 2005 so that I could consider a Frodo handful (4 fingers) of sci-fi films from that year: The Island (Steve Jablonsky), Serenity (David Newman), Star Wars – Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and War of the Worlds (both John Williams). Along with those, I also considered the great crop of sci-fi from last year: Avatar (James Horner) District 9 (Clinton Shorter), Terminator Salvation (Danny Elfman), and Star Trek (Michael Giacchino), along with Moon. Then I also thrown into the mix films like The Prestige (David Julyan…and yes it is sci-fi, think about it), Wall-E (Thomas Newman), and the aforementioned The Fountain (Clint Mansell). And while many of those are really good scores, they didn’t demonstrate the innovative approach that I was looking for. Most were traditional orchestral scores that sound like so much modern film music. And despite the fact that I enjoy many of them, I was looking for something more for this list. That little extra.\n\nFinally, despite listening to all or parts of these 16 scores along with a few others, this is by no means a comprehensive survey, but I feel good about my choices and stand by them. Though, as always, if you have any listening suggestions, I’m always looking for more material. So please let me know with your thoughts and comments.\n\nWow. Hans Zimmer has really outdone himself here. Inception is a score that grabs your attention and rarely lets go. Even the moments when it is a bit slower managed to keep my interest. The overall tone of the score itself is classic Zimmer, though I can hear some other influences in it. Depsite all of this, the score is also very original and quite a trip from beginning to end.\n\nThe album itself is kind of weird in a few ways. It begins with two fairly short tracks that feed into track three, which is where things really take off. But these opening three tracks also sound like they’re one longer track and if you aren’t paying attention, you’ll probably not really notice until track three really kicks off and you just have to check the track name (“Dream is Collapsing” if you’re interested). This is the track where the giant trombone/french horn/whatever-the-hell really kicks in. This sound was featured in the film trailers even as early as last summer, which is part of what I think helped this score achive what it as. According to interviews and such, Zimmer was working on this while Nolan was shooting (not unlike what they did for The Dark Knight). This kind of lead time has helped him to really craft a unique sound for the score.\n\nThat being said, there are obivous things that will remind a listener of The Dark Knight, and the very atmospheric nature of many of the cues also remind me of David Julyan’s work on Insomnia and The Prestige…especially The Prestige. But Zimmer takes that atmosphere and turns it into something much more. It breathes and moves though remaining in a sort of stasis. The guitar work, played by former Smiths member Johnny Marr, help the score find a groove that, especially in track 3, it rarely wants to shake. As I mentioned to a friend, I predict that “Dream is Collapsing” is going to be heard in many, many film trailers in the coming years.\n\nThe two longer tracks on the album, “Old Souls” and “Waiting for a Train,” are also worthy of mention. “Old Souls,” track 5, is almost pure atmosphere, featuring the piano theme (introduced straight away on the first track), over synth pads. The track doesn’t really waver from this theme and only varies instrumentation and adds in some other sounds. But despite this, Zimmer does such a good job of adding in new sounds to interest the ear that one doesn’t really notice that the track is nearly eight minutes long.\n\n“Waiting for a Train” starts out much like “Old Souls,” the music existing in some sort of otherworldy ether, and while it also mediates on the same piano motive (this time starting out in guitar) it also explores some other material, and the distinctive trombone/french horn/whatever-the-hell call is not present in it’s natural state until the end (though the arguement could be made that some of the string swells are variations). Though, I’d really like to know what the French song is doing in it about 3 minutes before the end. Guess that is something the film can answer.\n\nIf there is a cue that I don’t truly care for, it’s “Mombasa.” It’s a prototypical Zimmer action cue, and while it’s not terrible, it varies in many ways from the overall tone of the album that it kind of sticks out like [insert metaphor here].\n\nAnyway, there is more I could say, but I want to see the film first before I attempt a more in-depth analysis. Bottom line, though, this is my new frontrunner in the Oscar race.\n\n*And to further limit this, I’m only going to consider “narrative” animated programming. And by narrative I mean cartoon shows that are a full half-hour program with only one story and not a collection of animated shorts, such as the classic Warner Bros. and Disney cartoons. It also helps if the series as a whole has a larger structure, but that is not a requirement.\n\nSo now with those disclaimers out of the way, let’s chat. I already mentioned how after seeing The Last Airbender over the Fourth of July weekend I decided to seek out the original cartoon series and was wowed by the score. That got me thinking about animated shows as a whole and their scores. I have written in other places on this blog about animated shows and their music – such as Shirley Walker’s score for Batman: The Animated Series or the music for Cowboy Bebop – but I figured now would be the time for a formal declaration of what I think are excellent examples of scoring for animated television shows. Before we get to the list, I will provide one final caveat: I can only talk about what I’ve seen and know, obviously. This has been implied in all my earlier lists, but given my even more limited knowledge of a lot of cartoons, especially ones made post-2000, I figured it would be prudent to restate this fact. As is my “new” custom here, I’ll present these in chronological order.\n\nBatman: The Animated Series (1992-1995) – Shirley Walker, et al: For me, this is the cartoon series that really changed how I view the medium, it also helped that this was realesed just as I was entering adolescence. The series was dark, moody, and didn’t really shy away from dealing with topics seriously. It didn’t “talk down” to kids which is why those of my generation who grew up with the show still hold it in high regard and enjoy it to this day. And just as the series itself doesn’t fall into children’s cartoon cliches, so does the score. Building on the tone of Danny Elfman’s Batman film score (he also did the show’s theme), Shirley Walker and a team of composers wrote orchestral music that set the standard for how I judge music for animated shows. La-La Land records released a two-disc set with music from a collection of episodes back in 2008, but it quickly sold out due to fans like myself snatching up all of the 2,500 copies. Just shows that even after almost twenty years, this show continues to have an impact.\n\nCowboy Bebop (1998-99) – Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts: The first of two Japanese anime shows on this list, Cowboy Bebop has a stunning score that pulls from just about every musical style there is, though, as the title indicates, it focuses mostly on jazz traditions. I didn’t discover this series until the penultimate year of my collegiate education (sometime around late 2002), but the first episode I saw, entitled “The Ballad of Fallen Angels,” was a great entrance into the show. Featuring an opera scene that takes its cues from the opera sequence in The Godfather, Part III, and a pop-song sequence, along with more conventional non-diegetic scoring, the episode encapsulated just how closely music is tied to the overall aesthetic of the show. And what is so great about Bebop and the other anime on the the list (see below) is that they are both 26-episode long shows that were planned as such. This means two things: first, relatively cheap complete DVD sets (around $50 each, and usually available at your local Best Buy), and second, there is a continual story arc from the first episode to the last which makes for a great viewing experience.\n\nSamurai Champloo (2004-05) – DJ Tsutchie, Force of Nature, et al: This is the other anime show on the list, and whereas Bebop is a jazz influenced show, Samurai Champloo, despite its 19th Century setting, features a soundtrack of hip-hop, rap, and R&B. And while you might think this anacronism might clash or be distracting, it works so well because the characters themselves are anachronistic in some ways. Their attitudes are more contemporary, one character, Jin, sports John Lennon-esque glasses, which, while not uncommon in the era, certainly separates him out. While personally I don’t like this score nearly as much as Bebop – if it’s for pure listening pleasure I will go for Bebop before Champloo – I find that I think it works quite well in context and the sheer variety of tracks and styles set it apart from the everyday fare of animated programming. For comparison, the only other anime series I really enjoy, The Big-O (giant robot anime and such but with a noir-ish twist), while having some nice score pieces that help set the noir tone of much of the series, they are too few and are overused. What, for me, helps set a television score apart is how often they will “go to the well” and reuse music. If a composer is given enough freedom and time and can write enough new music for each episode and lessen the use of preexisting tracks, it helps raises the overall quality in my opinion.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender (2005-08) – Jeremy Zuckerman: Zuckerman is one-half of The Track Team who do both music and sound, with Zuckerman obviously doing musical chores. As I mentioned in my review of James Newton Howard’s Last Airbender score, the music for this series uses a lot of traditional Asian instruments such as the duduk, shamisen, pipa (or biwa), and koto (or qin) – it’s sometimes hard to tell the difference between some of the Japanese and Chinese instruments by sound alone. It took most of the first season for the score to really find its voice, but one it did the sound of the series really opened up. The series started out fairly conventionally, both in terms of tone and plot as well as the score, but once it found a solid footing in a larger story mythology, the stories started to go deeper into the emotion and background of the characters. Like Batman: The Animated Series, this is a cartoon that will be long appreciated by kids, teens, and adults alike, and a musical score that is as challenging in tone as this one is goes a long ways. How many other cartoons feature a duduk? Seriously! Well, at least one other…\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-Present) – Kevin Kiner: The score for the television Clone Wars series (not to be confused with the earlier series) follows much in the style of the CGI film, in fact the film itself was really just a multi-part episode re-edited for the theatre. Kiner’s score for both the film and series follows in the tradition of Avatar in that he uses a lot of instruments not before heard in an animated show…well at least until Avatar itself (though some of the Asian instruments, such as duduks and taiko drums, had been used perviously in Bear McCreary’s Battlestar Galactica score). According to an interview for the film’s special features he strives to create a new sound for each world featured in the show, and he succeeds in large part. I’m slightly confused that on IMDB Kiner is only credited for 17 episodes on the series, but no other composers are listed under the series credits. I’m guessing that someone has been slacking off in the cataloguing department because each episode features mostly new music and new themes as characters are introduced to the series. In a three-part story arc ending season 2, the young Boba Fett, a well-known character from the original film trilogy, is introduced and has teamed up with a group of Bounty Hunters (many seen at other times in season 2) in order to seek revenge on the jedi who killed his father. For this, Boba is accompanied by a theme that is strongly reminiscent of Harmonica’s theme from Once Upon a Time in the West, which is fitting since Harmonica was seeking revenge for the death of his brother in that classic film. Oh, and the score also features the big orchestral sounds that one would expect of a Star Wars related score…so it’s got that going for it, which is nice.\n\nWell love it or hate it, those are my five. Next week, in recognition of the upcoming release of Christopher Nolan’s Inception (music by Hans Zimmer), FSFT5 will take on Sci-Fi scores of the last five years. Will Zimmer’s efforts make the list? I don’t know since the score isn’t released until 7/13. Regardless, I’ll hopefully have a full review up sometime over the weekend of the 16th. And, finally, Bear McCreary has at long last gotten some love from the Emmy committee! His theme from Human Target has been nominated in the category of “Outstanding Main Title Theme Music.” Congratulations, Bear!\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there have been two recent Star Trek score releases that feature expanded/complete scores. For any fan of Trek and film music, it has indeed been a good year, a good few years in fact considering last year’s release of the complete Wrath of Khan score, and this year we have James Horner’s companion piece in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and a deluxe/complete edition of Michael Giacchino’s score for last years Star Trek reboot. I’ll offer here a few thoughts on each release, but I can tell you right now that both of these come with my highest recommendation.\n\nStar Trek III: The Search for Spock – James Horner: Many fans find this film troubling and hard to quantify. It’s nowhere near as bad as Trek V, nor as slow-moving, “boring,” or esoteric as The Motion Picture (though I have always felt that MP has been misjudged and misunderstood), but at the same time The Search for Spock is nowhere near as good as the films that came before or after it, or Star Trek VI. It is merely mediocre Trek. For these and other reason, the score has always been judged similarly. It builds on many of the themes and sounds that Horner established for the Trek universe in Wrath of Khan, but without many of the intense battle sequences found in that film, it lacks some of the excitement and punch of the previous score. It has the same main theme and also features the bowed vibraphone sound that characterized Spock, and also features a new theme for the Klingon villains, and even though that theme shares similar qualities to Goldsmith’s klingon theme from Motion Picture, it is nowhere near the same level. There is also a new theme for the Genesis planet that is at the heart of the plot of III, but truly the stand out track on this album is the nearly nine minute cue “Stealing the Enterprise.” This cue ebbs and flows along with the action, shifting tone as the scenes changes from the Enterprise bridge to that of the pursuing Excelsior. Also included in the set is a ten-minute cue of source music that was used in the bar scene when Dr. McCoy is trying to get a ship to take him to Genesis. For this, as explained in the always wonderful Film Score Monthly liner notes (some twenty pages), Horner took three songs from the Paramount library and arranged them into bar muzak. A little unnecessary, but Trek fans do tend to be completests. Also in the set is a second disc featuring the original score album, which at times differs from what was used in the film and is found on the first disc. It is an over-the-top, complete set that should find its way onto your score shelf. What I really hope that this combined with last year’s Khan release indicates that FSM will be working to release all of the Trek scores in a complete/expanded edition, especially Star Trek VI and all of Goldsmith’s scores.\n\nStar Trek: The Deluxe Edition – Michael Giacchino: Last year’s release of Giacchino’s Trek score by Varese Sarabande was at the same time a good release but also hard to get a handle on, and with this new release, I finally understand why I was a bit off-put by it: the music on the original release was too alike. It featured all the major themes of the score, but there wasn’t enough diversity in tone, it was mainly action music and there was no push and pull to the disc. This has all been corrected in this release. Featuring two-discs of music from the film and presented in order, you’ll find all the tracks from the first album, including some additional music on those tracks, and all the music that was missing. It not only gives a better feel for the score as a whole, it also further demonstrates something I commented on in my original review: not only was he purposely evoking the sound of the original series, but he was also pulling from the scores of Horner and Goldsmith (though more Horner in my opinion). As I also pointed out in the earlier review, the track “That New Car Smell” is especially pulling from the Horner sound, as are many new tracks featured on this release. To try and catalogue all of these and how Giacchino pulls from the earlier scores, would be quite an undertaking, but maybe someday when I have time I’ll take a stab at it. But I’ll say this, Giacchino truly is a master of imitating period styles and synthesizing them into his own idiom. In same ways, he reminds me of what Michael Kamen did in his Die Hard scores by interpolating a famous musical theme into the sonic fabric of the score. For this release, we also see that Giacchino continues his tradition of humorous cue titles, which I know not everyone likes, but I find amusing and I believe fits not only his personality, but also that of much of his music. If there is a complaint with this new set, it is two-fold, and they both have to do with packaging. First, the booklet: it features the obligatory write-up from the director J.J. Abrams that I assume was part of the original release (I got mine off iTunes so I wouldn’t know), and a new short piece from the founder of the original Star Trek fan magazine. Both are well and good, but neither really delivers any real information on what went into the score itself. And that is my big disappointment, in a twenty-some-odd page booklet, there are the two short “essays,” a personnel list for the orchestra, credits, track listing, and then pages and pages of pictures. Seriously, we’re music fans, give us music content. Oh well. Secondly, the entire thing is contained not in a standard two disc case, but rather an oversized digipack that will not fit well on your standard DVD shelf. See the picture below:\n\nIt’s a bit taller than the standard case and quite a bit longer so that it’ll most likely stick off the end of your shelf. It’s like some of the annoying DVD packaging that has come out in recent years. I don’t want bells and whistles in my package, I want content! Anyway, despite the lack of truly informative content in the package and the annoying size and shape of the case, I still recommend this set to fans as it ill help to get a good feel for the scope of Giacchino’s score.\n\nWell that’s about it for now, my laundry should almost be done so I better get to folding. See you all a bit later this week.\n\nSo you’ve been asking yourself what you should go see this holiday weekend. Well if the idiots outside my window who have been setting off firecrackers and other explosive devices for the last MONTH are any indication, then it’s probably a nice bar-b-que and a fireworks show. But should your plans also take you to the neighborhood cineplex, then perhaps I could help guide you…aurally speaking at least. For today, I shall review James Horner’s The Karate Kid score and James Newton Howard’s latest efforts to salvage a terrible film from M. Night Shyamalan, The Last Airbender.\n\nIt’s a little bit funny that these films have so much in common: both are big screen remakes/adaptations of previously existing material, both deal with the martial arts in some capacity, and both have composers with James as a first name. But where The Karate Kid is an enjoyable and entirely watchable film featuring a stellar performance from a young actor, The Last Airbender is nigh unwatchable with a terrible script that even a cast made up of all-star child actors from days gone by couldn’t save. Seriously, I felt bad for the actors trying to deliver some of their lines with a straight face, like I felt bad for the actors in the Star Wars prequels. In fact, if there was an award for worst script to a summer tent pole film ever, I think The Last Airbender and Star Wars – Episode II: Attack of the Clones might actually tie. Oh wait, I forgot the sand speech in Clones. Okay Lucas, looks like you win again.\n\nBut enough about bad scripts, if there was an area where Airbender actually somewhat beats Karate Kid it is in the music department. Though, I do find both scores enjoyable and both have been in heavy rotation on my iPod for the past few weeks. So let’s go to the digital tape.\n\nThe Karate Kid – Horner’s score here is not much of a stretch for James. The opening track on the album, “Leaving Detroit,” will evoke memories of classic Horner with its lone trumpet and piano based sound. It’s wistful and sad, though without falling into depression and melancholy. And for most of the score, Horner never really lets one forget that it is a Horner score, his fingerprints are all over it, though mostly in a good way. His tone matches the film well, though there are a few odd moments. The track “Backstreet Beating” sounds like it was stolen from an 1990s Hans Zimmer score with copious electronics (seriously, think Crimson Tide, but not as good), and the tournament montage track, “Tournament Time,” sounds at times like it was made from some leftovers of Zimmer/Newton Howard’s efforts for the Batman films – especially the first minute or so. But where Horner does shine in this score is when he beautifully blends traditional Chinese instruments into his orchestral textures. Tracks like “Journey to the Spiritual Mountain” and “From Master to Student to Master” show Horner in careful control of his orchestral timbres (they are also the two longest cuts on the album). The last cue, “Final Contest,” is a great ending track and builds to the final moment where our valiant hero wins the tournament. Listening to the track on its own, you would almost think that two large armies were about to square off, Horner plays it up the epic and it works. Having seen both this film and the original with score by Bill Conti, I much prefer Horner’s efforts. In the original I find Conti’s panpipes overwhelming and somewhat annoying. And, I know it was 80s, okay, but how many bad 80s montage songs could you find in one film, seriously? Luckily, for us, in the remake the director choice to forego montage songs and let Horner play the montages instrumentally. And while I think plotwise the original was a bit more solid, this new remake is enjoyable on its own and features a great Horner score. It’s hard to believe that this is a score from the same person that I was so incensed by back in December for what I still feel was some blatant cultural insensitivity in his Avatar score. And speaking of the Avatar, but not blue people, but rather Aang, let us turn our critical eye to…\n\nThe Last Airbender – Many people say that a large part of what makes the films of Alfred Hitchcock work so well is the music of Bernard Hermann, and while I haven’t seen enough Hitchcock films to say that with any certainty, I will concede this fact for now and use it as a basis for my critique that follows. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan has worked with largely with one composer throughout his film tenure. For Shyamalan, it was only his first two films that were not scored by James Newton Howard. But where some scholars think that Psycho would have only been a mediocre film without Hermann, I doubt that even Bernard could have saved The Last Airbender. And while Newton Howard is not Hermann, he did craft a great score here and I think it was just about the only thing that kept me from walking out of the theatre in the first ten minutes…and I sat through Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (granted, I was a teenager at the time, but that’s not an excuse). Now, as with Hitchcock, I have not seen many of Shyamalan’s film, and Last Airbender is the first time I had seen one of his films since I saw Signs in the theatre. But despite the film, Newton Howard has created an effective score here (though, he couldn’t help but hear some borrowing a bit from David Arnold in a few places, in my opinion). I can’t be sure, but I think one of the ways he approached this score was to create a different orchestral theme for each of the four elements. The last track on the album, “Flow Like Water,” feature what I think is, surprise surprise, the water theme. It would take more viewings to confirm this, but since in the Avatar world the cultures are so linked with the elements that they can command, it would only seem like a logical way to approach the score. And should they make the second and third films of the series, it would provide some ready material for them. Now, since seeing the film, I have been acquainting myself with the original cartoon series. The series is American made, but borrows heavily on the Japanese style of anime. Its score feature copious amounts of traditional Asian instruments, helping to establish the culture of the world, and while Newton Howard uses some of the same instruments, his score is pervasively Western in its orientation. Besides “Flow Like Water,” stand out tracks include the album opening “Airbender Suite” and “Journey to the Northern Water Tribe” (which also features that water theme). I don’t know what else I can say, really, without trashing the film itself further. Check out the score, though, it is one of the better ones this year so far.\n\nNow speaking of the original cartoon, watch out next week for when FSFT5 takes on animated shows and their scores.\n\nFinally, I’ve also been listening recently to Michael Giacchino’s Earth Days score. This documentary came out last summer and was also shown on PBS. The score is nothing truly special, but if you enjoy his work, especially many of his best moments on Lost, you should download it from iTunes. Well that’s all for now. Check in a bit later this weekend for my reivew of Star Trek: The Deluxe Edition and the expanded Star Trek III: The Search for Spock release from Film Score Monthly."
