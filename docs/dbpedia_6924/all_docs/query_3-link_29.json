        "text": "Episode 512 – Film Scoring Mixer Alan Meyerson, Possible TikTok Ban, And The Caesar’s Console\n\nMy guest this week is engineer Alan Meyerson, who many believe is the top scoring mixer in film today.\n\nWith more than 200 credits, Alan has worked with leading film score composers like James Newton Howard, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, and Danny Elfman, and has a particularly long-standing working relationship with the great Hans Zimmer that continues to this day.\n\nAlan’s credits as a scoring mixer include blockbuster movies like Man of Steel, Iron Man, the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Inception, The Dark Knight, Kung-Fu Panda 1 & 2, Despicable Me 1 & 2, The Last Samurai, Gladiator, and Hannibal. In addition to this, he also has a number of music mixing credits that include Bryan Ferry, New Order, Etta James, and OMD.\n\nDuring our interview, Alan told me about being a part of the first wave of dance music, making the transition to film work, his approach to orchestral recording, why he isn’t into vintage microphones, how he tailors his reverbs, dealing with 750 tracks of orchestra, his adventures at Abbey Road, and much more.\n\nI spoke with Alan from his studio in Los Angeles.\n\nOn the intro I looked at the possible TikTok ban in the United States, and the Caesar’s Palace console finds a new home with UA."
