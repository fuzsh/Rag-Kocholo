        "text": "Surrey-born David Holden traveled the world in his youth, bouncing between New Jersey, Illinois, England and Nairobi, Kenya. He planted roots to attend The Berklee College of Music and study Film Composition. The natural pull of Los Angeles lured him there following graduation. He worked with Hans Zimmer at Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions as well as James Newton Howard at his JNH Studios. Studying under these two luminaries gave him the opportunity to not only learn, but to apply his craft to many hit films, TV shows, and video games. His love of film composition continues to this day and, following in the footsteps of his mentors, he has started his own studio, Dave Holden Music, in Burbank, CA."
