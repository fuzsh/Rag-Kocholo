        "text": "With the recent publication of the edited collection Brian Eno: Oblique Music (Albiez & Pattie, 2016) and the distribution of Brian Eno’s 26th solo studio album Reflection in 2017 on vinyl, CD and as an innovative software application, the time is ripe for a reconsideration of the way in which software has been used by the musician, composer, record producer and visual artist Brian Eno. This paper explores how Eno has used simple but innovative ideas and processes to inform his music over the course of his career, and considers how his work with collaborators – specifically the musician and software designer Peter Chilvers – has converged with the emergence of touchscreen technologies and modes of distribution. We will demonstrate how Apple’s App Store global distribution platform has further disseminated Eno’s ideas of ‘generative music’ to a wider audience through he and Chilvers’ Bloom (2008), Trope (2009/2015), Scape (2012) and Reflection (2017a) software applications for Apple’s iPhone and iPad, and the impact on the distribution and reception of Eno’s own music. Echoing Eno’s own processes of appropriation, remix and collaboration the authors wrote the paper through exchanges dictated by the turn of a card selected from the third edition of the Oblique Strategies deck, issued by Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1979.\n\nThe Nigerian film industry (Nollywood) embraces both motion picture and television approaches; yet it cannot be called one or the other in its entirety. This ‘both and neither’ nature has forced scholars such as Kenneth Harrow to ask: ‘how are we to read their films?’ and, by virtue of this article, their film music. I argue that the capacity to do so subsists in a thorough understanding of the industry’s organisation and long-held divergent creative process. My ethnographic study reveals that Nollywood’s structure of film music production differs significantly from some other known cinema traditions of the world. One such striking observation is that Nollywood film music projects and production (recording, editing, spotting, etc.) are entirely carried out without the involvement of film directors. And this unique process and structure strongly influences its film music approaches and aesthetics. This paper, thus, presents and examines those differences with a view to offering insights on how Nollywood film music might be understood.\n\nThis study seeks to present the motivators behind the consumption of videogame soundtracks outside of the gameplay environment. This dissertation proposes a three-part consumption model that describes these different motivators and the interactions between these imperatives. At the heart of this study is the intention to demonstrate that videogame music has become a very important part of a videogame’s concept, design, and marketing; it not only plays a significant role within the game, it has also transcended the medium and is enjoyed by audiences beyond the game. This media migration generates questions regarding its effects and the motivations why people listen to videogame music outside of the game, and the ramifications of this consumption at the personal, social, and game industry levels. Why are people listening to videogame music, one that is designed for an interactive medium, in a linear medium (such as a CD, an audio file, or a re-interpretation)? In what ways does the game experience and the music create associations that affect the audience at a personal level? How did game music become this consumable object and what is its value for consuming audiences? How does the consumption of OSTs affect future game music composition and what is the role of the audience in this? And what does this mean for the shelf-life and marketability of videogames?\n\nThis dissertation analyzes how Contemporary music for audiovisual media integrates with the concept of Hyperreality, as defined by Jean Baudrillard. The study begins with a philosophical investigation for the ontology of the concept of hyperreality, integrating Baudrillard’s philosophical thought with McLuhan’s theory of media. Further, it discusses the ontology of cinema and music in relationship to hyperreality, with special emphasis to digital cinema. As an art born in the twentieth century, cinema has a integral relationship with the hyperreal. In this context, I define the Hyperorchestra, a virtual music ensemble that inhabits in hyperreality, product of the process of virtualization of the musical experience that started with the audio recording. I describe how this newly defined ensemble combines traditional live instrumental techniques with the utilization of Sample Libraries and Synthesizers, in addition to recording techniques and sound processors, to generate music that transcends both the framework established by Western musical traditions and what can be achieved just by physical means. The second part of the dissertation is analytical. First, it describes one of the key new tools for the Hyperorchestra: the Sample Libraries and MIDI, which acts as an interface that surpasses traditional music notation. The section continues by analyzing the musical scores in Contemporary movies that highlight the utilization of diverse Hyperorchestral techniques. The final part of the study focuses on the aesthetics of the new ensemble. It defines new frameworks that aim to model the music experience when transported to hyperreality. Moreover, it defines Hyperinstruments, the hyperreal counterpart of the physical musical instruments. Finally, the study centers in Hyperorchestration, which defines the new set of tools and techniques associated with writing music for the Hyperorchestra. With these new tools, the Hyperorchestra is afforded the power to generate music that utilizes the whole sound spectrum, closing the gap between music composition and sound design, at the same time that it becomes a powerful tool for the transmission of meaning.\n\nThrough the multiplicity of the fast, ever-growing digital communication and information sharing during the first years of 2000 to the present date, millions of online users produce, transform, criticize and circulate between them an endless amount of materials and contents. Videogame music itself has its own networked culture with its cybercommunities that discuss, share and create, thus allowing an open space of creativity and artistic activities in a digital and constant flow. One of these activities is music composition and production for this medium, available on music sharing platforms such as Spotify or Soundcloud, on Youtube and specifically in the format of modification files2. This type of content is developed in a voluntary and free way through tools and softwares now available from video game companies and also on the internet with its due functions. While the areas of sociology, new media, game design, among others, already develop research on mods as a digital phenomenon of fan culture and its relationship with industries, concerning aspects of co-creative work and its surrounding cybercommunities, the field of musicology (both in the international and national academic worlds) is marked by the scarce research that contributes to the understanding and formulation of knowledge about musical mods that are created (or, in this case, composed) for videogames on which the creators of mods have bent over. This dissertation focuses on the musical mods present in the Nexus Mods website in two of the video games that are hosted and managed by it: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Bethesda Softworks 2006) and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda Softworks 2011). Through research, sources and interviews conducted to the mods composers, I intend to demonstrate the existence of a new model of online musical production and circulation, reflective of participatory culture age in which it is inserted. It will be discussed the whole process of access, composition, availability, sharing and visibility of their compositions, their motivations, and personal discourses about the composition of music for video games. On the other hand, the perspectives on the concept of musical immersion, considered indispensable by composers and players, are particularly relevant: music in this medium and its compositional style is related to the idea of verisimilitude with a certain reality as a primary aspect in the player's involvement in the virtual universe with which he is interacting. The intersections between these components thus construct a new paradigm of musical composition and renegotiation, placing this dimension at a higher level of importance and meaning amid videogames and its cybercommunities.\n\nThe thesis examines the role of music in South African film pertaining to representation of identity of South African peoples and cultures, from the country's earliest sound films until the industry expansion of the 1970s. Chapter 1 contextualizes the study in relation to South African film and music, mainstream (Hollywood) film music theory/analysis/history, and national film music studies outside the Hollywood context. Chapter 2 provides an analysis of nationalist trends in South African silent film and the transition to sound film. The subsequent two chapters analyse the filmic use of rural and urban African music as tools of representation of African identity across a continuum of films, from earlier colonial/Afrikaner nationalist-oriented films to later films with an explicitly anti-apartheid message. The final chapter returns to the themes of Chapter 2, exploring film-musical representation of Afrikaner nationalism. As with Chapters 3 and 4, the source material is eclectic, covering a broad spectrum of techniques to promote a nationalist agenda. The study reaches four principal findings. Firstly, film-musical representation of African identity develops nuance over time, as African subjects succeed in moving from being represented to achieving some self-representation. This representation remains within the ambit of diegetic music, however, and frequently maintains a subject/object relationship regarding white/black representation. Secondly, the use of diegetic African music functions as a form of othering, creating an illusion of representational \"authenticity\" while in practice ensuring the music remains external to the filmmakers' expressive universe, relegating it to the role of \"ethnic\" colour rather than engagement with characters' psychologies. Thirdly, film music is implicated in issues of land rights: rural African music questions the legitimacy of \"whites only\" city spaces, and is metaphorical of population displacement from rural to urban locales. Conversely, nationalist films use pastoral tropes to reimagine rural African spaces through European conceptualizations of \"tamed\" land, and sentimentalize spaces through song to lay claim to them through emotional ties. Fourthly, it evaluates African music's potential to function as dramatic, narrative, extradiegetic underscore, showing how this was partly achieved by certain films of the period, with possible implications for contemporary mainstream film scoring. http://hdl.handle.net/11427/27459\n\nThe essay discusses the socio-cultural implications of cross-genre musical borrowing in the production of American mainstream ‘pop’ music released post-2015, examining the ‘creative versus commerce’ conflict surrounding modern musical borrowing practices. The essay focuses on the significance and effect of cross-genre musical borrowing on modern ‘pop’ music production practices through exploring the interconnected relationship between developing music technologies and the evolving role of the music producer, giving a brief overview of how improving technologies have benefited modern production practice. It also examines the oligopoly of the American music industry, and indeed the global music industry, and its effect on the consumption practices of mainstream ‘pop’ audience; particularly how the industry practices feed into the ‘hyper-culture’ of the modern society. In addition, the essay concurrently provides an analysis of the different manifestations of musical borrowing in mainstream ‘pop’ music released within the last two years, as well as considering the specific documented American copyright laws, particularly legal and financial issues associated with these manifestations. The time-limit focus in this case is largely due to the fast and constant evolution of what is commercially popular."
