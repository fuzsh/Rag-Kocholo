        "text": "One day recently my mind was wandering while listening to Mike Oldfield. And this thought came to my mind: what would Mike Oldfield's music sound like if it was interpreted by Hans Zimmer in his most recognizable form, which is the BRAMMMMMMs from Inception. That is, for the small percentage of people who know who Hans Zimmer is but are not die hard fans like me, so to them he's the Inception BRAMMMM guy.\n\nMy best friend and I share a lot of the same taste in music, and we're both fans of both Oldfield and Zimmer (he's 51 and I'm 52, so we have old people taste in music). Initially, I was going to do this little five minute joke with a chopped mix of Tubular Bells, adding the BRAMMMs, which Project Sam offers in its most perfect form for free in their Free Orchestra, the one called Pandora Bursts, adding maybe a thing or two here and there.\n\nBut then I started liking the results, and added more and more tracks with Symphobia, obviously tons of the Spitfire Hans Zimmer Strings, both in sustain and staccatos, and just like a junkie in need of a high, I wanted more and more and more and when I had enough, I still wanted more. So in went new stuff from Komplete 14 CE, Arturia's CS-80, Analog Lab V, Stradivari cello and violin, all playing the same MIDI region, the usual Tubular Bells melody at the beginning.\n\nSo I ended up with something that I really liked, that sounded grossly saturated and loud like many Zimmer albums (and hell if I don't love that), and when I was finished, I ran it through that automatic thing Ozone 10 has where it calculates everything and adds like ten EQs and other stuff, and it spit out something that to me sounded pretty great, even if not on par with a Zimmer album. But good enough that it may be believable to the common folk that it's an actual release on iTunes.\n\nMy original plan was to tell my best friend something like \"Hey, look what I did, man! Zimmer playing Tubular Bells!! Hahahaha!!!\", and we were going to have a quick laugh together.\n\nBut then the jackass in me took over and said \"No, sir. This is good material for a prank.\"\n\nSo I sent him a message on Whatsapp that's a bit long for there, but basically I built the whole thing up, telling him something like \"Dude, my mind is blown into a million pieces. Zimmer is doing a tribute album to bands and artists from the 70's and 80's that used a lot of synths in their music, and he dropped kind of an intro to it on iTunes today!!\"\n\nTo make it more believable, I bounced the project with the option to add to Music, then opened the info for the track, and entered all the metadata to make it more legit, down to \"©2023 Remote Control Productions, Inc.\" in the comments, which is Zimmer's production company. I don't know how to put in the \"Mastered for iTunes\" logo, so that's about the only thing I didn't do.\n\nThen I did a Google search for a picture of him, downloaded it, opened Affinity Photo and created an album cover to add as a thumbnail to the file. The cover is as lame as can be, since it took me 10 minutes, but funny enough, it kinda looks real:\n\nSo I send him the file, he listens to it, and says \"Dude, this sounds so Tubular Bells!!\"\n\nAnd I couldn't stop laughing, but then I thought, well, maybe I didn't do such a bad job. This guy, like me, is an audiophile. He has some money to treat himself to some decent audio gear every once in a while, and has been doing so for the last 30 years. He knows music, his vinyl collection is probably about 500 or 600, and the same for CDs. So he has a good ear, this is not the typical person who thinks Apple's Airpods Pro are the absolute best way to listen to music and nothing sounds better.\n\nNow, that was two weeks ago and I still haven't told him the truth. And what I gave him was what I thought that day was the final version, but like a true virtual instrument MIDI DAW addict, I had to keep adding things, and tweaking and a few days ago I said STOP! So here's the finished version:\n\nYou don't have to, but if you want, tell me if this would pass to you as an authentic release, if Zimmer announced tomorrow that he decided to branch out from movies for a while and do an album of tributes to his favorite artists, and the dropped this on music services, when you listened to this, would you think this is up to at least bare minimum standards for a published song?\n\nProbably not, after all, it was done as a prank, but give it to me straight, I know this is not a masterpiece. Probably more like a mas-turd-piece, am I right? 🤣\n\nJoking aside, this was a learning project to me, I still learned a lot of new things, partially thanks to the awesome people in this forum as usual, and part just playing around in Logic and discovering new things, so thanks so much to you all, your advice is so appreciated.\n\nBesides that, I love reimagining music that was created as rock or synth music and playing it with completely different instruments, like orchestral ones, which are my favorite ones.\n\nNow I'm in a pickle, because he asked me what other artists he was going to pay tribute to, and I said \"Not sure, but he mentioned Pink Floyd and Jean Michel Jarré, probably Vangelis.\"\n\nNow, we're both Pink Floyd fans, so I would love to do one of their songs, but I can't think of anything PF that would fit Zimmer's style, even if I didn't do the BRAMMM thing. I barely know Jarré, and HZ did an amazing Vangelis tribute with his Blade Runner 2049. So I'll probably tell him the truth soon enough.\n\nIf you read this far, I guess my question to you is: Why? 😆"
