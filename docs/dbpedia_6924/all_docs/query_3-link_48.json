        "text": "*milestone* I wanted to share that my green card has been approved! After 7+ years of working in LA I‚Äôm finally becoming a permanent resident. I would like to thank Hans Zimmer, James Newton Howard, David Fleming, Alan Meyerson, Scott Michael Smith for their continuous support and my incredible family that has accompanied me through this long and stressful journey and my friends who are always there to pick me up when the unavoidable doubts creep in. This is so energizing, I am very excited and looking forward to the future in a way that I couldn‚Äôt before. A huge door is open now, and I‚Äôll do my best to honor this opportunity by finding ways to give back to my community and represent Mexico as best as I can. üá≤üáΩü§ûüá∫üá∏\n\nGustavo Santaolalla‚Äôs iconic score for The Last Of Us got nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award this year. Can‚Äôt describe how lucky and happy I am to have contributed music for this first season. Thanks to David Fleming for bringing me to this ride. This internet breaking episode ‚ÄúLong, Long Time‚Äù caught everyone off guard, fun, intense, romantic, tragic, beautiful. If you watch it again, look out for the scene where some jerks tried raiding Frank and Bill‚Äôs sweet residential fort. I almost broke my guitar bowing it to create nasty nasty growls. Worth it. If you are keen, you can listen to it here: https://lnkd.in/gXKYj25U"
