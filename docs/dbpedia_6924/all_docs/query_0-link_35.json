        "text": "I think I knew the answer for this once. Not sure if it was an interview with him or one of his 'offsprings' or even something I read on an SB forum.. Sadly I don't remember what it was.\n\nHowever there was a time when Cubendo performed significantly better on PC than Mac and might have been even stabler on PC than Mac. I myself, a machead since 1988, bought my first pc around 2002 to run in my studio for these very reasons. I still use a PC in my studio (though I spend way way more time the last few years on my pre-production mac setup running Cubendo).\n\nrsp\n\nThere was a point in time where cubase definitely performed better on windows than on osx. Maybe still does, no clue.\n\nBut I would imagine that during that time so many additional tools and software has been written for custom samplers, controllers, etc for zimmer et al that a transition to running it all on macs would be expensive and time consuming by now. Considering the size of their operations and the need for servers to enable their workflows you'll also be better off financially running it on non-apple machines. Not that that would be an issue by now I reckon, but still.\n\nHaving said that there are without a doubt a lot of apple computers at remote control. I imagine all pro tools stuff is probably running on them.\n\nI have absolutely no insights into their setups btw, so I might be completely off the mark.\n\nTheir needs are not your needs however and you can happily compose on either. I myself run cubase on windows and I'm quite happy with it, bang for buck when you put together your own machines. But I also use a mac for almost everything else.\n\nThere was a point in time where cubase definitely performed better on windows than on osx.

But I also use a mac for almost everything else.\n\nApparently your insight was spot on\n\nrsp\n\nThere are professional system builders that will tell you the heavy hitters always use PC. These are not people who buy their systems off a shelf. They are custom made with plenty of pricey components. It's also up to them to consider a system obsolete instead of Apple. That doesn't mean they don't use Apple. There's a lot more options in a custom PC.\n\nbecause the best use the best\n\nJokes (kinda) aside, I have direct experience of using Cubase and Nuendo on both platforms (a few years back not recently) and the difference in performance was not minimal at all. It was night and day and the Mac systems were lagging behind on ideally very similarly specd machines.\n\nPro Tools was always 99.999% Macs and I have never ever personally seen a pro studio with a PC to run PT."
