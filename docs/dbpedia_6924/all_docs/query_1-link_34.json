        "text": "Welcome back, friends, to the final installment. If you missed Part 1, Part 2 or Part 3, please click away and check them out at your convenience. That said, let’s finish this up!\n\n“Run Free” – “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron” (2002)\n\nThere is no soft intro to “Run Free” – Zimmer begins the propulsive movement in the first second of the cue. Almost like hoofbeats thundering across the frontier. I adore the main identity introduced here – one he would mature later as a love theme in “Winter’s Tale.” The cue increases exponentially in excitement as it goes along – look at the left turn it takes around 2:25. All in all, this is Zimmer working at the peak of his inspirational powers.\n\nBias Check: I was a staff writer on DreamWorks Animation’s sequel series “Spirit Riding Free” for its first eight seasons.\n\nCo-Composed by Steve Jablonsky\n\n“Molossus” – “Batman Begins” (2005)\n\nOkay, I think we can all agree that the naming process of this album was… uh… not the most ideal. This is why I believe it’s less discussed than the other two scores for the Christopher Nolan trilogy – it’s more difficult to talk about names like “Antrozous” and “Corynorhinus” without wasting time looking up the score. And yet one cannot ignore that this adrenaline-pumping work (co-composed mainly with James Newton Howard) set the template for Zimmer’s collaborations with Nolan, and most of his future action work for the next decade.\n\nCo-Composed by James Newton Howard, Ramin Djawadi and Mel Wesson\n\n“Budget Meeting” – “King Arthur” (2004)\n\nIt’s not often that one would call a cue “hysterical,” but that is what we have here. It’s as if Zimmer took all of his major recurring action score techniques and threw them into a blender set on high. In other words, “Budget Meeting” is a lot, but in all the right ways. From the choir to the bass to the drums to the everything, the entire nine minutes feels like one protracted musical climax.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith and Rupert Gregson-Williams\n\n“160 BPM” – “Angels & Demons” (2009)\n\nThough there are many highlights from the Robert Langdon trilogy, “Angels & Demons” represents the best score of the three, and the best mash-up of Zimmer’s rock sensibilities and his love for classical music. “160 BPM” has both in spades, pitching an insane choir of what I can only imagine are demon priests against his trademark drums and electronics. You finish the cue sweaty, exhausted… and exhilarated.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe and Atli Orvarsson\n\n“Maestro” – “The Holiday” (2007)\n\nOne of the high points of Zimmer’s romance writing (a genre he sadly seems to have abandoned since “Winter’s Tale”), “Maestro” is one of those goosebump-inducing cues that makes you smile and reach for “repeat.” The soft cooing of the female vocalists has rarely mixed better with strings. Bonus points for the fact that the cue (and film itself) have increased in popularity over the past 12 years – it seems to have entered the zeitgeist in a way few other cues do. It’s now a mainstay at weddings and anniversary parties.\n\nAlso, “The Holiday” was my first Zimmer album, so there is that.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe, Heitor Pereira, Henry Jackman, Imogen Heap, Atli Orvarsson and Reyland Allison\n\n“Beyond Rangoon” – “Beyond Rangoon” (1995)\n\nThere are two kinds of Hans Zimmer fans: those that count “Beyond Rangoon” as one of their very favorite scores by the maestro, and those who have not heard it yet. The John Boorman film is barely remembered, but the music? It has persevered, remaining one of his most highly regarded works. This finale cue represents Zimmer at the height of his creative powers, deftly mixing horror, suspense and the awesomeness of the culture & landscape without allowing one aspect to overwhelm the rest. It’s a nearly impossible task, and yet here we are.\n\n“Love” – “The Boss Baby” (2017)\n\nThere is a reason there are three cues from DreamWorks Animation projects in the top 25 – it is one of the most viable, creative partnerships ever between a creator and studio. Not since the Golden days of Hollywood have we seen such a pairing. “Love,” which was written by master orchestrator and composer Conrad Pope, is a true highlight. He takes the main theme of the film and layers it over and over, until we get a stunning piece of film music you would never guess comes from something called “The Boss Baby.” I cried the first time I listened to it.\n\nCo-Composed by Steve Mazzaro and Conrad Pope\n\n“A Small Measure of Peace” – “The Last Samurai” (2003)\n\nThough the content of “The Last Samurai” film hasn’t aged well, Zimmer’s exquisite score has only gotten better as the years pass. A beautiful ode to the music of Japan, Zimmer utilizes many instruments primarily used there to create a tragic, almost Shakespearean mood, never more gorgeously rendered than in “A Small Measure of Peace.” You can tell the work was very personal for him, and the results speak for themselves.\n\nCo-Composed by Blake Neely, Geoff Zanelli and Trevor Morris\n\n“Peacemaker” – “The Peacemaker” (1997)\n\nIn 1995, “Crimson Tide” changed film music forever… and in 1997 Zimmer created its spiritual sequel in all but name. “The Peacemaker” is all blunt force trauma – deftly carrying over all the style and execution that made “Crimson Tide” groundbreaking. It doesn’t break new ground, but then again it doesn’t have to… there’s something to be said for an action and suspense score that simply embodies those feelings entirely. As will become normal the closer we get to the top, there are many cues here that could have been chosen, so I’m going with “Peacemaker” because it functions as an attractive summation of all the major ideas within the score.\n\nCo-Composed by Gavin Greenaway and Harry Gregson-Williams\n\n“Finale” – “The Lone Ranger” (2013)\n\nThis astonishing nine-and-a-half minute “Finale” cue isn’t just content with reprising the classic William Tell Overture that is so famously identified with the title character. No, it then warps and reconceives the theme (after a straightforward presentation at the outset) and then begins rolling in the major ideas of Zimmer’s score for good measure. In many ways, it perfectly represents the meshing of the classic and the modern… and how both can coexist within the same outstanding piece of music.\n\nCo-Composed by Geoff Zanelli, Rupert Gregson-Williams, Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, Jasha Klebe, Lorne Balfe and Jack White\n\n“Life Must Have Its Mysteries” – “Inferno” (2017)\n\nThough I have little love for the “Inferno” score as a whole, and frankly think its mediocrity robbed us of one of the best film score trilogies of all time, I will nevertheless bow down to the excellence of “Life Must Have Its Mysteries.” Within these magical four minutes are the most outstanding rendition of Zimmer’s iconic “Chevaliers de Sangreal” theme. So beautiful is this iteration that it may lift the listener out of his or her chair with joy at the way Zimmer carefully enhances and toys with the original theme. Unmissable stuff.\n\nCo-Composed by Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, Richard Harvey, Michael Tuler and Paul Mounsey\n\n“Oogway Ascends” – “Kung Fu Panda” (2008)\n\nSpeaking of the best film score trilogies of all time, whoever would have thought that “Kung Fu Panda” would be one of them? And yet here we are. Co-Composed with John Powell for the first two parts and Lorne Balfe for the third, these movies represent Zimmer at his most exotic and playful. For me, it doesn’t get better than “Oogway Ascends” – a cue that, while only two minutes long, is just about as perfect as film music gets.\n\nCo-Composed by John Powell and Henry Jackman\n\n“Stampede” – “The Lion King” (2019)\n\nThe scores for the live-action Disney remakes have been wholly outstanding – though they have been most interesting in that in certain cases they allow the composer of the original score to reinterpret and update their own work. Alan Menken did it with “Beauty & the Beast” and “Aladdin,” managing to one-up his original in both cases. And now Zimmer has done the same here. Though “Stampede” follows the same basic structure of the classic cue, Zimmer has rolled up his sleeves to make it sound bigger… more epic… more everything.\n\nCo-Composed by Lebo M, Steve Mazzaro and David Fleming\n\n“No Time For Caution” – “Interstellar” (2015)\n\nThe fact that “No Time For Caution” – one of the best Zimmer composed cues of all time – was not available on the original release of “Interstellar” is still cause for frustration by many fans. In fact, the entire release, with hidden cues only available if you scour different distributors, remains ludicrous, greedy, and something thankfully not repeated since. As to the music itself? Brilliant. Here is the best rendition of the ideas that Zimmer was exploring with the project – the organ, the slow build, the layers upon layers. It all clicks, it all works, and its brilliance is almost otherworldly (okay, I need to stop now).\n\n“Tennessee” – “Pearl Harbor” (2001)\n\nThough an argument could be made for the love theme in film up next on the list, for me the most beautiful romantic theme Zimmer ever penned was the central one for “Pearl Harbor.” Harkening back to the Golden Age of film scoring, this feels like something Alfred Newman or Miklos Rozsa could have penned back in the day. It feels eternal, ageless and hits you right in the heart. The tender piano! The aching violin! Michael Bay’s abortive film didn’t deserve this lovely melody, but I’m so happy it exists.\n\nCo-Composed by Klaus Badelt, Steve Jablonsky, James S. Levine, Geoff Zanelli and Fiachra Trench\n\n“I Don’t Think Now Is the Best Time” – “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” (2007)\n\nThis ten-minute monster of a cue serves as the climax to the original “Pirates” trilogy, and its high point. Nearly every major theme and idea Zimmer had conjured gets a nod here, and the rendition of the franchise’s love theme also gets a spectacular display for good measure. But to me, this cue – and the score itself – represents another climax and moment of transition for the maestro itself. With it, Zimmer takes all his sounds, statements and trademarks of his career, many tracing all the way back to “Crimson Tide” and brings them back for one victory lap. Though there are exceptions, after this Zimmer would alter his voice – leaning more toward ‘80s Vangelis (“Dark Phoenix,” “Interstellar”) or experimental (“Inferno,” “Dunkirk”). It’s a beautiful goodbye and glorious reminder of what he can achieve at the height of his action prowess.\n\nCo-Composed by Geoff Zanelli, Lorne Balfe, Henry Jackman, Nick Glennie-Smith, Tom Gire, Atli Orvarsson and John Sponsler\n\n“End Titles” – “Driving Miss Daisy” (1989)\n\nWithout “Driving Miss Daisy,” there would be no Hans Zimmer as we know him. A low-budget, entirely synthetic affair, it is grounded by a catchy main theme that one could argue Zimmer has never quite topped. Actually, I take that back. It doesn’t ground anything… it lifted the movie… and Zimmer’s career… into the stratosphere. This final cue represents five minutes of pure magic – and the best rendition of that theme – one that has become even more popular than the film it supports. This is the type of feel-great music that touches your soul – it’s simple, lovely and gorgeously rendered.\n\n“Burn It All” – “Backdraft” (1991)\n\nAs far as cues of relentless action, both within Zimmer’s career and within all film scores, you can’t do much better than “Burn It All.” Produced just as Zimmer was perfecting the sound that would represent his Remote Control Productions, there is not a wasted breath or note in these five minutes. Bold, loud and with distinct, well-used electronic manipulations… it breaks out the children’s choir just when you think it can’t get any more tense. In here, you can feel the sounds that he would mature fully in his other iconic scores like his three “Pirates” films, “Gladiator,” “King Arthur” – even the Robert Langdon trilogy.\n\n“Vide Cor Meum” – “Hannibal” (2001)\n\nThis incredible mini-opera was composed by Patrick Cassidy and used in the film when Hannibal Lecter and one of his soon-to-be victims attend a performance together. An adaptation of Dante’s “La Vita Nuova,” it builds beautifully to almost heavenly proportions. The entire “Hannibal” score is one of Zimmer’s greatest, and yet its release perhaps the most infuriating his career, right along with the lack of expanded release of “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” and the lack of any release of “The Preacher’s Wife.” Several cues are mixed with Anthony Hopkins’ voice reciting random lines, many of which are not from the film. Indeed, even this cue has it – stop the recording before the last twenty seconds, I beg of you. Still, the quality speaks for itself – this is some of the best music composed this century. It has so entered the zeitgeist that even the “Hannibal” television series used it for impact in its first season finale.\n\nCo-Composed by Patrick Cassidy, Klaus Badlet, Jim Dooley, Nick Glennie-Smith, Steve Jablonsky, Geoff Zanelli and Clay Duncan\n\n“Now We Are Free” – “Gladiator” (2000)\n\nIt would be remiss of me to not take a moment during this countdown to praise all of the fabulous Co-Composers and collaborators the maestro has worked with throughout his career. Many of the moments on this list, including this and the previous cue, would not have been possible without their input. Here Zimmer teamed up with two of his most important muses: Klaus Badlet and Lisa Gerrard. Indeed, beyond composing, Gerrard’s voice is the one we hear singing throughout the transcendent four minutes. I encourage you to look back down the countdown to see how much of an impact they had – “Pirates,” “The Bible,” “Mission: Impossible 2” “Invincible”… Zimmer knows how to surround himself with the best and brightest.\n\nAs to the music itself, the words Gerrard is singing aren’t actually a language, but that doesn’t make the feelings and emotion it invokes any less impactful. I love the instrumentation and uplift invoked here after a difficult score of battle cues and explosive action – the film revitalized director Ridley Scott’s career, made an A-lister of Russell Crowe… and gave us one of the best scores of all time.\n\nCo-Composed with Lisa Gerrard, Klaus Badlet, Nick Glennie-Smith and Jeff Rona\n\n“Journey to the Line” – “The Thin Red Line” (1998)\n\nIf you asked me what single cue made the most impact in Zimmer’s career, my answer would be “Journey to the Line.” Not only is it one of his most brilliant single works, but it has been used endlessly (endlessly!) in temp tracking and trailers to this day. Hell, Zimmer himself would create variations on the cue in his famous “Time” from “Inception” and less successfully in “Solomon” from “12 Years a Slave.” It would be rude of me to call out other composers for using the music because it is more likely the fault of the directors for insisting on its inclusion, but a quick Google search would show you if you are curious.\n\nRegardless, there is a reason for its popularity… it is awesome. You’ve got that ticking clock which Zimmer loves so much at the opening, building slowly and slowly over the course of its nine-minute runtime into something of great power. Though it seems simple and straightforward on the surface, it’s deceptively so… its movement speaks to your very soul, washing over you and sweeping you away with its power.\n\nCo-Composed by Klaus Badelt and John Powell\n\n“Kings of the Past” – “The Lion King” (1994)\n\nFor these top three scores, nearly any cue from them could have easily found its way onto this Top 100 list, so figuring out which one best represented the work has been… uh… weirdly stressful. At least I got to cheat a little bit with “The Lion King” because I included “Stampede” from the remake a little further down the ranking. It’s kind of shocking that the maestro has only won one Oscar – for this score – but at least it’s for one of the greatest works of his career and one of the best scores for an animated feature period.\n\nI chose “Kings of the Past” because I think it’s the best cue across all the various album releases, but also because it moves me every time I listen to it. The strings strike something deep inside me, and the soft cooing of the choir during the second half only underlines the beauty contained herein. It’s the last time I’ll mention this (because we are almost out of cues), but here we have yet another example that the music of Africa inspires the maestro more than any other … and every time he uses it, you walk away with a great score.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith and Mark Mancina. Choir arranged by Lebo M\n\n“Roll Tide” – “Crimson Tide” (1995)\n\nAnd here we are. At the score that changed everything. There was adventure music before “Crimson Tide,” and then there was adventure music after “Crimson Tide.” Not only did it win a Grammy Award, but it was instantaneously a smash hit among score fans and everyone who mattered in Hollywood. Testosterone is the name of the game, and the music has the impact of a sledgehammer to the chest. It’s got everything that would become a hallmark of Zimmer’s methods – deep male choir, electronic enhancements of percussion and those strings… oh those strings. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer would love it so much that he would begin a long-lasting relationship with Zimmer, using him or his Remote Control studios for blockbuster after blockbuster, often booting the original composer after he or she failed to properly emulate the maestro’s sound.\n\nAnd for decades, that sound has been the prominent one in action. But while lesser composers can copy the methodology, they lack Zimmer’s talent at composing amazing themes. I chose “Roll Tide” as the highlight from the album because it gives the listener the fullest overview of all the amazing theme work Zimmer accomplished with this masterpiece, and hearing the entire seven minute cue is one of the most exhilarating experiences someone who loves music can have. Bonus points for the beautiful segue into “Eternal Father Strong to Save” at the end.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Chariot Race” – “The Prince of Egypt” (1998)\n\nWhile my head was telling me that “Crimson Tide” was the obvious number one pick, my heart kept telling me otherwise. In the end, I decided to follow the latter. If you’ve never heard “Chariot Race” before, that’s because you have the regular edition – the cue only exists on a special “Collector’s Edition” that was available at Wal Mart and is mostly filled with songs. But it is essential Zimmer and, for me, the best cue of his entire career. In other words, you need to track it down pronto if you have never heard it before.\n\nI need to break down the reasons for this choice. First, why “The Prince of Egypt” and secondly why this cue in particular. As to the first, whatever your belief in a higher power may be, it is clear that this project unlocked something in Zimmer we have never seen before or since from him. His inspiration is clear in every note of music, and the themes he conjured here have never been topped – my favorite being the primary one for God himself. It’s music you will never forget once you hear it… music that will stay with you and haunt you for the rest of your life. And I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nSecondly, why this cue? For awhile, I was going to go with “Red Sea” and then “Burning Bush” became the favorite, but in the end nothing topped “Chariot Race.” The six-minute masterwork is divided into two distinct three-minute sections.\n\nThe first is the actual chariot race in the film, a blockbuster of a playful action cue that plays to all of Zimmer’s strengths. It’s pure adrenaline, building quickly and a joy to listen. Alone this cue would have probably made it to my top 15.\n\nBut then we have the second three minutes, which is the finale of the movie. Within it are all the major themes of the film (including instrumental versions of the “Deliver Us” song), culminating with the transcendent God theme that ends the cue with an explosion of musical bliss.\n\nIt’s a testament to Zimmer’s compositional excellence, his unmatched theme creation and the beauty of his melodies, all wrapped together. That’s why I chose it as the best cue in his filmography.\n\nFilm music… scratch that… music doesn’t get better.\n\nCo-Composed by Harry Gregson Williams, Rupert Gregson-Williams and Klaus Badelt. Songs by Stephen Schwartz.\n\nBut what about you? What is your favorite piece of music from the maestro? Hit me up in the comments and let’s talk about all the reasons we love Hans Zimmer.\n\nOh hello again. It’s been so long. If you missed Part I (which has a handy dandy explanation of the rules of this countdown you should definitely read before you hate post) or Part II, please follow the links and check them out. Here we go…\n\n“Bus Stop” – “Spanglish” (2004)\n\nWhat better way to showcase a cultural meshing of American and Mexican families than by meshing together strings and guitar? One of the very best of Zimmer’s lighter scores, the maestro plays the two off one another in various cues throughout, but the highlight has got to be “Bus Stop,” which deftly transitions from comedy to drama to emotion and back again.\n\nCo-Composed by Heitor Pereira, Henning Lohner and Trevor Morris\n\n“A Better Man” – “As Good As It Gets” (1997)\n\nWitness Zimmer roll his style into the more romantic sides of Thomas Newman and Rachel Portman. Like “Spanglish,” the strings here are the key to our emotional engagement. “A Better Man” represents the full maturation of the lovely love theme (see what I did there?)… and its best rendition… it builds beautifully over its five-plus minute runtime.\n\nCo-Composed with Harry Gregson-Williams and Bruce Fowler\n\n“Rise” – “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012)\n\nThough as a whole, “The Dark Knight Rises” is a step down in quality from “Batman Begins” and “The Dark Knight,” both of which were co-composed by James Newton Howard, Zimmer pulls out all the stops for “Rise,” which serves as a climax to his work across the entire franchise. It manages to address both the bombast and explosive nature of his sound and the quieter, softer moments.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe, Tom Holkenborg, Andrew Kawczynski, Jasha Klebe, Steve Mazzaro and Ramin Djawadi\n\n“The Preacher’s Wife Suite” – “The Preacher’s Wife” (1996)\n\nAn uplifting ode to gospel music in one moment and some of Zimmer’s most engaging romantic writing in the next (6:20ish always gives me goosebumps), this nearly 18 minute suite is a mainstay on my Christmas playlist. Though nominated for an Academy Award, the score has never seen an official release – a major frustration for Zimmer fans and a huge missed opportunity for record labels.\n\nCo-Written by Nick Glennie-Smith and Bruce Fowler\n\n“Lullaby” – “Lauras Stern” (2004)\n\nAs delicate as Zimmer’s music comes, this little-heard gem shines brightly, never moreso than in this string-led cue. Co-Composed with Nick Glennie-Smith, this 2-minute lullaby may bring a tear to your eye… in the best way possible.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith and Henning Lohner\n\n“The Journey/Kopano Part III” – “Tears of the Sun” (2003)\n\nAs I wrote in earlier installments of this countdown, mixing Zimmer and Africa will inevitably yield excellent results, and his work on “Tears of the Sun” is no exception. Reunited with several fantastic talents, including his “Lion King” collaborator Lebo M and “Gladiator’s” Lisa Gerrard, the entire score is an embarrassment of riches, never more so than in this final cue, which is centered around a beautiful song and melody guaranteed to give you goosebumps.\n\nCo-Composed by Lisa Gerrard, Lebo M, Steve Jablonsky, Jim Dooley, Heitor Periera, Andreas Vollenweider and Martin Tillmann\n\n“Life Goes On” – “A League of Their Own” (1992)\n\nI would not fault you for preferring the gangbusters “Final Game”, which is rightly universally praised, but for me the heart of the “A League of Their Own” will be this beautiful melody that represents the love of the sisters. Dramatic without ever veering into melodrama, the main theme here is one you whistle for weeks after.\n\n“Broken Arrow” – “Broken Arrow” (1996)\n\nSeven minutes of bombastic action fun – we all know that the main theme here was lifted by the “Scream” quadrilogy to serve as the character theme for (of all people) dummy Officer Dewey. But here the music gets its proper opportunity to shine as Zimmer embraces his love for Morricone’s Western stylings and merges them with his own action sensibilities.\n\nCo-Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and Don Harper\n\n“Chevaliers de Sangreal” – “The Da Vinci Code” (2006)\n\nOkay, before your head explodes, calm down. I love the “Chevaliers de Sangreal” theme just as much as you do, and I agree that it is one of the maestro’s most transcendent pieces. So why is it all the way down here at 41? Because I like this rendition, despite it being the first iteration, much less than other versions of it elsewhere in the Robert Langdon trilogy. So stay tuned…\n\n“Honor (Main Title Theme From ‘The Pacific’)” – “The Pacific” (2010)\n\nAn outstanding ode to the sacrifice of our soldiers, “Honor” gets the goosebumps going as soon as that lonely trumpet begins. The rest of the cue holds that quality, merging Zimmer’s best dramatic sensibilities – it’s telling that he doesn’t embrace the action route that we would expect. It’s manages to be that rare piece of music that works on a cerebral level and also tug at your heartstrings.\n\nCo-Composed by Blake Neely and Geoff Zanelli\n\n“Rock House Jail” – “The Rock” (1996)\n\nThough “The Rock” is primarily credited to Nick Glennie-Smith, Zimmer provided the film its memorable main theme. That theme gets its biggest workout in this poorly titled cue – turn it up all the way and feel that bass throbbing.\n\nCo-Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams and Don Harper\n\n“Discombobulate” – “Sherlock Holmes” (2009)\n\nZimmer completely re-envisioned Baker Street’s most famous resident here, making him sound off-kilter, quirky and just plain fun – and in the process uses every variant on violin playing possible. This approach would reverberate into dozens of other period scores for film and television shows that wanted to feel modern. Do I still prefer something like Bruce Broughton’s masterpiece “Young Sherlock Holmes” for the character? Yes. But Zimmer’s vision is nonetheless admirable.\n\nBias Check: I am currently developing a television series for Dan Lin, one of the producers of this film.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe\n\n“Escape” – “The Little Prince” (2015)\n\nOne of the most overlooked scores in all of Zimmer’s oeuvre, “The Little Prince” is an astonishing work. The score itself was primarily composed by Richard Harvey (Zimmer handled the songs), and “Escape” provides a beautiful encapsulation of all the main themes. It’s inspiring, explosive and playful in all the right places – if you haven’t had the luck to listen to the entire album before, it comes highly recommended.\n\nCo-Composed by Richard Harvey\n\n“Call Your Wives” – “Hidden Figures” (2017)\n\nZimmer and his co-composers had little interest in providing a routine dramatic score for this historical drama. Here we’ve got soul music at its very best that is guaranteed to get your toes tapping. It elevated the film itself and every time this cue comes on, I can’t help but listen on repeat.\n\nCo-Composed by Pharrell Williams and Benjamin Wallfisch\n\n“You’re So Cool” – “True Romance” (1993)\n\nFew other cues in Zimmer’s extensive filmography are as recognizable in the zeitgeist as this one from the Tony Scott film. It’s kind of astonishing that Scott allowed this type of music to be the main identity for the movie, especially considering its content, but it is, in its own way, a perfect representation of the whack-a-do nature of the protagonists.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith, Mark Mancina and John Van Tongeren\n\n“Injection” – “Mission: Impossible 2” (2000)\n\nThough Zimmer’s installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise is the weakest score of the bunch, there are still several highlights. But the one cue that transcends the rest is “Injection” – which is brilliantly grounded by the voice of Lisa Gerrard. The way Zimmer puts her voice together with his usual suspense pacing somehow explodes with emotion, and the guitar accents later the cue are a welcome surprise.\n\nCo-Composed by Klaus Badelt, Lisa Gerrard and Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Jack Sparrow” – “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest” (2007)\n\nPerhaps Disney’s most popular live action character of all time, Jack Sparrow’s identity is fully explored here. He’s a perfect match for Zimmer’s more eccentric side, and the cue is playful and memorable throughout. Though there would be better individual cues within the franchise, this theme stands up above theme all, even the main “Pirates” theme from the first film.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe, Tom Gire, Nick Glennie-Smith, Henry Jackman, Trevor Morris, John Sponsler and Geoff Zanelli\n\n“Radio Flyer Part 1” – “Radio Flyer” (1993)\n\nMaster composer John Williams has a much different, distinct style than Zimmer, but Zimmer did warp his usual methods only once to sound like the maestro: for the much-maligned film “Radio Flyer.” Most likely director Richard Donner (who famously collaborated with Williams on “Superman”) insisted on that style of music, and Zimmer gave him what he wanted. The results are beautiful, often heartbreaking and sometimes transcendent. This kind of music may be a blip in Zimmer’s career, but it’s an unmissable one.\n\nCo-Composed by Shirley Walker\n\n“Cold War” – “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” (2014)\n\nWith apologies to Danny Elfman, James Horner and Michael Giacchino – Zimmer’s main Spider-Man theme remains my favorite for the character (I know I’m in the minority here). “Cold War” is a mash-up of that, the Electro theme (which is much more famous and well-regarded) and some Goblin content. The mixing is a smidge off in places, but this is such a cool mash-up of great themes that you can’t help but love it.\n\nCo-Composed by Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr, Tom Holkenborg, Mike Einzinger, Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski, Arturo Sandoval, Czarina Russell, Andy Page, Adam Peters and Anne Marie Simpson\n\n“Zen Ball Master” – “Kung Fu Panda 2” (2011)\n\nZimmer and co-composer John Powell managed to one-up their already-excellent score for the first “Kung Fu Panda” movie with this sequel. “Zen Ball Master” takes their theme for the title character and explodes it into a big, delightful action cue that moves so quickly it often seems like it’s dancing.\n\nCo-Composed by John Powell, Lorne Balfe, Dominic Lewis and Paul Mounsey\n\n“Planet Earth II Suite” – “Planet Earth II” (2017)\n\nMany people, myself included, consider George Fenton’s scores for the original “Planet Earth” and “Blue Planet” to be the best documentary scores ever created. So obviously Zimmer had quite a mountain to climb if he was to come anywhere close to matching that quality. And while I don’t think he quite managed it, his sequel scores are – on their own – absolutely beautiful. This suite is, for me, the highlight of both scores, and one I return to often. That last minute… wow. Just wow.\n\nCo-Composed with Jacob Shea and Jasha Klebe\n\n“Mother Africa” – “The Power of One” (1991)\n\nI am beginning to sound like a broken record, but Zimmer + Africa = Happiness. This won’t be the first cue that embraces that continental sound on this list, and it is also far from the last. Some incredible choir work accents this slow-build cue, which is the best of an album full of great cues.\n\nLyrics by Lebo M\n\n“Matt” – “I’ll Do Anything (1994)\n\nThis barely remembered James L. Brooks vehicle was supposed to be a musical… until preview audience scores led Brooks to excise all the numbers and go into heavy reshoots. Zimmer’s score represents him at the heights of his light, airy powers, juggling several themes with ease and seeming to have a grand time while doing it.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Las Vegas/End Credits” – “Rain Man” (1988)\n\nYes, it has aged worse than other Zimmer scores, but “Rain Man” still deserves a spot high on our list simply for how much of an impact it had on the maestro’s career. The music is engaging – gotta love that saxophone – and an addicting listen throughout, never moreso than this final cue.\n\n“Time” – “Inception” (2010)\n\nWait, what?! “Time” is all the way at 25?! There must be some mistake! Argle bargle! Yes, I love “Time” too, and I recognize how it has entered the zeitgeist in a way few other pieces of film music have. Hello, even 2Cellos has covered it! But the reason it’s stuck at 25 is simple – it in many ways mirrors/pays homage to/rips off an earlier Zimmer cue. A better one. One you’ll read about tomorrow in my top 25…\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe\n\nUp Next: Cars, Wheat Fields, Lions, Cannibals and even more Pandas\n\nWelcome back! If you’re joining us for the first time in our celebration of the 100 best cues from the scores of Hans Zimmer, please click here and check out 100-75 along with a breakdown of what I’m doing and how I’m going about doing it.\n\n“The Decision/End Credits” – “Thelma & Louise” (1991)\n\nZimmer matured his “Thunderbird” theme – that’s the one you’ve heard on all the compilation albums – beautifully in this climactic cue, adding in female vocalists to underline the beauty of the central relationship. It would have been so easy to make this tragic tearjerker, but Zimmer made the better decision.\n\nCo-Composed by John Van Tongeren\n\n“Lost But Won” – “Rush” (2013)\n\nThis wonderful throwback to the early ‘90s Zimmer sound is underlined by a throbbing beat that almost reflects a tire spinning on the road. The cue, while it does certainly rock, is surprisingly tender for a movie called “Rush,” and works like gangbusters in the film itself.\n\nCo-Composed with Lorne Balfe, Bryce Jacobs, Jasha Klebe, Michael Brook and Martin Tillman\n\n“First Born” – “First Born” (1988)\n\nThis miniseries main theme music is astonishingly awesome for the first minute, so much so that it would be ranked much, much higher on the list were it only that sixty seconds. But then the rest of the cue happens, which is… odd… at best. As a result, the cue took a tumble to the 70s. Do yourself a favor and when the singing starts, turn it off.\n\n“Honest, Brave & True” – “Muppet Treasure Island” (1993)\n\nLesser known than his Jack Sparrow stuff, Zimmer worked on this other Disney franchise entry with pirates, and smartly does not get lost in the parody aspects so many other Muppet scores have. “Honest, Brave & True” is a beautiful, emotional cue, almost James Horner-esque in places, that climaxes at 3:20 – any kid who grew up with the Muppets remembers this specific musical moment and the goosebumps it causes.\n\nCo-Composed with Nick Glennie-Smith, Harry Gregson-Williams and Graham Preskett. Songs by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil\n\n“Hate” – “Point of No Return” (1993)\n\nOh, how I love “Hate.” This little-remembered gem is a remake of “Nikita” and Zimmer’s score is everything you expect/want out of a ‘90s action score. Is it dated? Sure! But that’s not a bad thing in this case. Cheesy fun, with guitar riffs, rock & roll, and everything else awesome in excess. Some would call it a guilty pleasure, but for me it’s just a pleasure listening to it.\n\nCo-Composed with Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Victory Starts Here” – “Renaissance Man” (1994)\n\n“Renaissance Man” is the kind of score you either go with… or hate until you turn it off three minutes later. I have a soft spot for military-style music and appreciate Zimmer’s more zany mannerisms… so here we are. The build, ebbs and flow of this seven-minute cue can be quite exhilarating.\n\nCo-Composed with Nick Glennie-Smith, John Van Tongeren and Bruce Fowler\n\n“The Ascent” – “K2” (1991)\n\nZimmer’s music only appears in the European version of “K2,” and this is one of those instances where the cue is over 27 minutes (!!!) long and a compilation of multiple moods, scenes and sequences. The quality is quite good throughout, though sound is an issue on album, and several sequences feel like what would happen if Zimmer scored a James Bond movie.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Millennium Theme” – “Millennium: Tribal Wisdom in the Modern World” (1992)\n\nI attempted to read what the direct-to-VHS documentary series “Millennium: Tribal Wisdom in the Modern World” was about… but kept falling asleep. That said, this theme is fire – I really wish it had been attached to something bigger in the zeitgeist — it’s hugely unfair that it has fallen through the cracks of history.\n\n“Martha Lifts the Elephant” – “Invincible” (2001)\n\nIs this the best title of all the titles on this ranking? Maybe. But while the name may bring a smile to your face, the cue is dead serious. A beautiful choir mixed with stunning string work, this is a two-minute powerhouse cue that fans of “Crimson Tide” will eat up.\n\nCo-Composed by Klaus Badelt\n\n“What Are You Going To Do When You Are Not Saving the World?” – “Man of Steel” (2013)\n\nZimmer had his work cut out for him creating a new theme and identity for Superman – John Williams’ work on the character may well be the most recognizable, beloved such theme in film history next to the one for James Bond. And though he didn’t eclipse Williams, what we got was still damn good – the slow build here to the explosive main theme is sublime.\n\nCo-Composed by Tom Holkenborg, Atli Orvarsson, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski\n\n“Becoming Stars” – “Winter’s Tale” (2014)\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that Zimmer’s score (which he co-composed with Rupert Gregson-Williams) is by far the best part of this movie – one of the most notorious bombs of recent years. As a result, the score has barely gotten any notice, which is a bummer because of its excellence. Some ideas previous introduced in “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron” mature here brilliantly, and this ten-minute climactic cue is heartbreaking & romantic in all the right ways.\n\nCo-Composed with Rupert Gregson-Williams, Halli Cauthery and David Buckley\n\n“The House of the Spirits” – “The House of the Spirits” (1993)\n\nPerhaps Zimmer’s most blatantly depressing score, this is still beautiful… but a lot. Making it through creates a lot of attention and emotion on the listener’s part, but it’s definitely worth the effort.\n\n“The Walk Home” – “Cool Runnings” (1993)\n\nI love the quirk of “Cool Runnings.” The uplift. Those weird instrumentation choices. It all shouldn’t work… and yet it does. The entire score album is a treasure, but nothing beats the emotion Zimmer conjures here, especially in that last minute.\n\nComposed with Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Faith” – “The Bible” (2013)\n\nWere it not for the recording issues, “Faith” would have probably cracked my top 30. Alas, something weird happened in the mixing (or the production couldn’t afford the full orchestra it needed), resulting in a cheap-sounding listen that nearly destroys the beauty and power of the composition. This slow-burn cue is begging for a re-recording with a gigantic orchestra that can capture its excellence.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe, Jasha Klebe, Steve Mazzaro, Dave Fleming, Satnam Ramgotra, Gary Dworetsky, Andrew Christie and Max Aruj\n\n“Oogway’s Legacy” – “Kung Fu Panda 3” (2017)\n\nWith co-composer John Powell’s exit from the “Kung Fu Panda” franchise, Lorne Balfe joined Zimmer for the third entry and the high quality remained. “Oogway’s Legacy,” which balances the piano and strings for a tear-inducing start to the album, is the highlight, thanks in part to Lang Lang’s gentle piano work.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe and Paul Mounsey\n\n“A World Apart Suite” – “A World Apart” (1988)\n\nLike Zimmer and DreamWorks Animation, whenever you mix Zimmer and Africa, you’ve got a winner on your hands. This really, really long cue, which is credited (along with “The Power of One”) for getting the maestro “The Lion King,” goes through all the emotions and lingers long after with the listener.\n\n“Part II” – “Pacific Heights” (1990)\n\nThis odd, neo-noir thriller stalker mash-up gets a score it doesn’t deserve. Zimmer creates great tension throughout, grand romance… and when that saxophone plays over the piano? It’s pretty damn transcendent.\n\nCo-Composed with Shirley Walker\n\n“Genius” – “Genius” (2017)\n\nAt only 50 seconds, Zimmer creates a fantastic explosion of main title music that is difficult to get out of your head. Lorne Balfe would provide the often-quite-good series score, but you walk away humming these 50 seconds.\n\n“The Fruit Machine” – “The Fruit Machine” (1988)\n\nIf you asked me which cue in this top 100 sounded the least like Zimmer, I’d point you towards “The Fruit Machine.” A long, schizophrenic work that has more in common with John Barry or Jerry Goldsmith, it is nonetheless a fascinating listen that creates a crackling, nerve-wracking atmosphere.\n\n“Surfing Dolphins” – “Blue Planet II” (2017)\n\nOne of the biggest, most pleasant surprises of Zimmer’s output in the ‘10s has been his music for nature documentaries. Between “Blue Planet II” and “Planet Earth II,” there is barely a moment that doesn’t hit the mark. “Surfing Dolphins” is the high point of the album, a playful, triumphant explosion of notes and choir that can’t help but inspire.\n\nCo-Composed with Jacob Shea, David Fleming and Jasha Klebe\n\n“The Island” – “Fools of Fortune” (1990)\n\nAnother really long cue – this one at 18 minutes – that serves up the melodrama with flair. You listen to this and picture sweeping Irish moors, beautiful vistas and grand romances, played straight and without the usual Zimmer flourishes.\n\n“Vorspiel” – “Younger & Younger” (1993)\n\nHere is Zimmer making you feel good about your life – giving you an entire eight-minute cue whose only purpose is to make you smile. He embraces classic European sensibilities here, specifically the brighter work of Nino Rota… the music here is so light it could very well float away.\n\nCo-Composed by Alex Wurman\n\n“Like a Dog Chasing Cars” – “The Dark Knight” (2008)\n\nI have very mixed feelings about this cue, and “The Dark Knight” soundtrack in general. I intellectually appreciate what Zimmer was trying to do with his Joker theme… but it doesn’t work for me. For a long while I had “Harvey Two-Face” selected, because that is my favorite cue. And yet, I would be remiss if didn’t admit that, while I didn’t care for the Joker theme, I am in the minority – its impact among Zimmer fans and on film music in general is inarguable. It merits a place on the list if only for that.\n\nCo-Composed by James Newton Howard and Lorne Balfe\n\n“Baby, Baby” – “Nine Months” (1995)\n\nZimmer leans into his love for classical with this sublime romantic piece that plays to all of his light strengths. I have never seen “Nine Months,” nor do I want to, because I have a feeling that nothing will be quite as good as the feeling this music leaves in my mind.\n\nCo-Composed by Nick Glennie-Smith\n\n“Is She With You?” – “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” (2017)\n\nThis cue opens with perhaps the most instantly recognizable theme created in the past decade: Wonder Woman. And, were it shorter and just that theme, it would be higher on my list. But then, at 2:00 in, it devolves into a just-decent action cue. There’s some interesting interplay between the Batman (not Zimmer’s theme), Superman and Wonder Woman themes after, but nothing that matches the awesomeness of those first two minutes.\n\nCo-Composed by Tom Holkenborg, Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski and Benjamin Wallfisch\n\nUp Next: Da Vinci. Baseball. Princes. Pirates. Spiders.\n\nHans Zimmer has done more to create the sound of modern film scores than nearly any other composer. To coincide with the release of “The Lion King,” I have been revisiting every one of the maestro’s works, all the way from “My Beautiful Laundrette” to the aforementioned remake. Below, the first installment of the four-part “The 100 Best Cues.” I set a few rules for myself before I got started, and here they are:\n\n– 1 score = 1 cue. It would be unfair to fill up the list with multiple cues from “Gladiator” or “The Prince of Egypt,” so I have chosen a single outstanding cue from each of his works.\n\n– This list encompasses Zimmer’s film and television work.\n\n– Don’t expect all action. This is a celebration of Zimmer’s excellence at scoring all genres of film and television. If you’ve come here expecting all action, look elsewhere… though there will be plenty of action, don’t worry.\n\n– Zimmer technically didn’t have to write the chosen cue. Because of Zimmer’s collaborative way of creation, it is sometimes difficult to figure out what specifically is composed by him and what is composed by others on any specific album. As a result, I am just choosing the best music, full stop, and am crediting the album’s co-composers beneath each individual cue.\n\n– No big musical moments. Sure, Zimmer composed the score (and sometimes songs) for several musical films like “The Lion King,” “The Little Prince” and “The Prince of Egypt.” But I’m trying to focus on the scores wherever possible, so you won’t be seeing “The Circle of Life” here.\n\n– Everything is subjective. My personal top 100 cues will differ wildly from yours, and that is fine. Taste is subjective. The entire point of these lists is really to underline excellence and point out to readers art that deserves discovery.\n\nThat said, let’s get started…\n\n“Spider-Pig” – “The Simpsons Movie” (2007)\n\nChoosing Zimmer to score “The Simpsons Movie” seemed at first to be an odd choice, especially considering that the franchise’s sound is so engrained with the original theme by Danny Elfman or the series compositions by Alf Clausen. But Zimmer rose to the occasion, providing a funny, engaging, and smart score supporting the concept. This cue, a parody version of the original “Spider-Man” television theme (except… y’know… with a pig), throws in a male and female choir to make the cue as epic – and funny – as possible.\n\nCo-Composed by Ryeland Allison, Lorne Balfe, Henry Jackman, James Dooley, Michael Levine and Atli Orvarsson. Original theme by Danny Elfman.\n\n“Supermarine” – “Dunkirk” (2017)\n\nIt’s difficult to know exactly where to rank a cue like “Supermarine.” Listened to it on its own, it is overbearing, loud and blunt… almost impossible to get through on album. Worse, in terms of content, the cue is almost completely a regurgitation of previous Zimmer mannerisms, then adds nothing to the table. All that said, I must admit that it works incredibly well in the film itself, which is the main purpose of a score. So I’m putting the cue at 99, throwing up my hands and moving on.\n\nCo-Composed by Benjamin Wallifisch, Lorne Balfe, Satnam Singh Ramgotra, Andy Page, Andrew Kawczynski and Steve Mazzaro\n\n“Our Little Bit of Score” – “Riding in Cars With Boys” (2001)\n\nThe main theme here, which kicks in at 1:25, is one of the loveliest Zimmer (working primarily with Heitor Pereira here) has conjured for a romantic film – it’s a shame it isn’t better known or regarded. The cue would be much higher on the list, but there are definite problems with the suite, specifically the weird soft-rock with voice efforts from 2:00-3:00.\n\nCo-Composed by Heitor Pereira and James S. Levine\n\n“Main Title” – “Days of Thunder” (1990)\n\nSo upfront, apparently Zimmer hates his score to “Days of Thunder,” which is why it was so difficult to track down for years after its release. That said, it would be insane of me not to recognize the one instance where he manages to mash up his regular action swagger with… “Driving Miss Daisy”? It’s weird, it’s wild, and somehow it works in that gleeful cheesy ‘90s way.\n\nCo-Composed by Mark Mancina\n\n“Illest Gangsta on the Block” – “Chappie” (2015)\n\n“Chappie” provided an opportunity for Zimmer to compose his first all-synthetic score in years, and it definitely brought out his playful side. This is never more clear than in his ode to all things arcade – “Illest Gangsta on the Block,” which is a grand bit of fun… if you listen to it in the right mood.\n\nCo-Composed with Steve Mazzaro, Andrew Kawczynski and Tom Holkenborg\n\n“The Banker’s Waltz” – “Matchstick Men” (2003)\n\nA lovely waltz from a score where Zimmer has a lot of fun capturing the magic of Europe. The piece is obviously a nod to maestro Nino Rota’s Fellini scores (plus his work on the two “Godfather” films), but he never loses his own voice in the at-times-sublime excesses here.\n\nCo-Composed by Geoff Zanelli, James Dooley and Clay Duncan\n\n“Gas Station Shootout” – “Bird on a Wire” (1990)\n\nAn explosive mix of Zimmer’s late ‘80s/early ‘90s action sensibilities – the cue feels quite dated, but in a fun way. The constant building tension gets your blood pumping, and you’re going to be smiling the whole damn three-plus minute running time.\n\nCo-Composed by Luis Jardim\n\n“The General” – “Toys” (1992)\n\n“Toys” is one of those genuinely insane albums that feels like a weird amalgamation of every style of music trend from the early ‘90s, both in songs and score. It can get under your skin, you may want to pull your hair out… but it’s got that weird “something” that sticks with you long after you finish the album itself.\n\nCo-Composed by Trevor Horn, Bruce Woolley, Bruce Fowler and Jeff Rona\n\n“Walking, Talking Man” – “Regarding Henry” (1991)\n\nThis little-remembered drama has a stacked creative team – directed by Mike Nichols, written by J.J. Abrams and starring Harrison Ford & Annette Bening. After disastrous sneak previews, master composer Georges Delerue had his very-good score removed from the film and replaced by one created by Zimmer. The result is light, emotional and airy, never more so than in the piano-driven “Walking, Talking Man.”\n\n“Paperhouse Overture” – “Paperhouse” (1991)\n\nThis fascinating score has fallen through the cracks of time, but merits rediscovery. The cue is almost silent for the longest time, but when the score kicks in – it’s definitely worth the wait. We have a weird mix of Zimmer’s writing style and Jerry Goldsmith’s more grounded emotional fantasy from the ‘70s and ‘80s that doesn’t quite work in places. But when it does? Wow.\n\nCo-Composed by Stanley Myers\n\n“Burning Secret” – “Burning Secret” (1988)\n\nOkay, here’s the thing about this ranking. I would say that 85% of the cues are just that – cues that range anywhere from 1-10 minutes. But early in his career, Zimmer would often prefer creating gigantic suite cues which rolled many smaller cues together. “Burning Secret” is 24 minutes long (!) and is the only representation of the score available. It’s unfair to rank a single cue higher because it has the chance to develop in ways others can’t… but then again there’s a lot of slow space here. The result is a beautiful dramatic score with flutes that predate “Beyond Rangoon” and romance akin to John Barry.\n\n“The Crown” – “The Crown” (2016)\n\nThough Zimmer was not the composer for the series itself (that would be Rupert Gregson Williams in season one and him again with Lorne Balfe in season two), he places his stamp on the series with this regal main title theme, which is fitting considering the content.\n\n“Restless Elephants” – “Green Card” (1990)\n\nThis delight of a short cue is highly reminiscent of Zimmer’s “Rain Man,” though with a different theme. It’s not quite as memorable as that iconic score, but still an easy listen and a welcome addition to any playlist of the maestro’s lighter work.\n\n“Giant Blue Head” – “Megamind” (2010)\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that anytime you mix Zimmer (here co-composing with Balfe) with DreamWorks Animation that you’re going to walk away with a winning score, and this is no exception. “Giant Blue Head” introduces the world and character themes, along with a gentle male choir and a bunch of quirk that will make you grin.\n\nCo-Composed with Lorne Balfe\n\n“Grace” – “Something to Talk About” (1995)\n\nThis country-tinged cue, which runs nearly six minutes, is a lovely embodiment of the main theme for Julia Roberts’ titular character. Soft but also roaming, it could do without the electric guitar that ages the cue, but the positives more than make up for it.\n\nCo-Composed with Graham Preskett\n\n“Best Friends” – “Madagascar” (2005)\n\nThough Zimmer has not provided as much original music to this DreamWorks Animation franchise as he has others (thanks to the musical aspect of the trilogy), this infectious theme – heard through whistling – remains one of the sweetest representations of friendship in his oeuvre.\n\nCo-Composed with Ryeland Allison, James Dooley, James S. Levine and Hector Pereira\n\n“Leave No Man Behind” – “Black Hawk Down” (2001)\n\nA beautiful slow-burn of a track, “Leave No Man Behind” functions as a tribute to our soldiers. Simple in its composition, it is also a surprisingly emotional listen that grounds an otherwise schizophrenic album experience.\n\nCo-Composed by Rachid Taha, Denez Prigent, Michael Brook, Craig Eastman, Hector Pereira, Martin Tillman and Mel Wesson\n\n“Liberty Theme” – “Sons of Liberty” (2015)\n\nZimmer penned only the theme to this little-seen History Channel miniseries (Lorne Balfe would compose the series score and also work on the theme), but it’s a gangbusters opening, with Spanish dancing reminiscent of “Mission: Impossible 2” and the swashbuckling & fiddles of his “Pirates of the Caribbean” films. If you missed it upon first release, it’s worth seeking out.\n\nCo-Composed by Lorne Balfe\n\n“Opening Tango” – “Two Deaths” (1995)\n\nZimmer has written several tangos over the course of his career, but the most memorable – and quirky – of the bunch has to be this two-minute treasure from “Two Deaths.” Playful and a great mood-setter, the instrumentation here brings the cue to a different level.\n\n“The Critic Main Theme” – “The Critic” (1994)\n\nThis beloved-but-short-lived animated series’ main theme represents a distinctive feel for 1970s and early 1980s sitcoms, but in a good way. You can pick up nuggets here of movements Zimmer would perfect later with his romantic comedy scores, and when the theme kicks in it is quite an earworm.\n\n“Bank of England” – “Thunderbirds” (2004)\n\nThis late-album cue has everything fans of Zimmer’s Remote Control action scores love, but the big difference is that iconic sound is mixed here with the boldness of a John Barry/David Arnold-style James Bond score.\n\nCo-Composed with Ramin Djawadi. Original theme by Barry Gray.\n\n“First Ideas” – “Frost/Nixon” (2008)\n\nThis tense-as-hell ten-minute cue underlines that Zimmer should really be scoring more thrillers. A beautiful slow burn with pianos and violins (yes, those are the expected instruments, but they are beautifully used), it quickly gets under your skin and puts you on edge… but in a good way.\n\nCo-Composed with Lorne Balfe\n\n“Rango Suite” – “Rango” (2011)\n\nCertainly one of the most eccentric scores Zimmer has ever composed, his “Rango Suite” stylishly meshes his adoration for the work of Ennio Morricone with the lighter comedy of the animated film. It certainly won’t be to everyone’s taste, but I love when Zimmer plays with his music like this.\n\nCo-Composed by Heitor Pereira, John Thum, David Thum, Rick Garcia, Kenneth Karman, Gore Verbinski and James Ward Byrkit\n\n“Piece Offering” – “An Everlasting Piece” (2000)\n\nOh, how I wish Zimmer would create Irish music more often. His grossly overlooked work for the all-but-forgotten “An Everlasting Piece” is not only the best thing about the film, but a fascinating mix of classic Irish melodies and rock. It shouldn’t work, and yet it does. And beautifully. This cue is the most emotional of the album, but the rest is highly recommended.\n\nCo-Composed by The Jigs, Heitor Pereira and Martin Tillman\n\n“Too Many Notes – Not Enough Rests” – “Drop Zone” (1994)\n\nThe sound quality of this otherwise awesome cue leaves much (much!) to be desired. The title says it all, but really, does that have to be a bad thing? The most notable thing in the cue happens at 2 minutes in – a beautiful section that points the way towards one of the most iconic themes ever produced at Remote Control.\n\nCo-Composed with Nick Glennie-Smith, John Van Tongeren and Ryeland Allison\n\n“120 Days and Nights in a Laundrette” – “My Beautiful Laundrette” (1985)\n\nThough his career technically started with a television film called “Success is the Best Revenge,” Zimmer considers his first major score to be “My Beautiful Laundrette” – co-composed with Stanley Myers. Allow me to underline this upfront – this music is insane. But it’s got personality, life and certainly is a major first impression for the maestro.\n\nCo-Composed with Stanley Myers\n\nUp Next: 74-50. Get ready for Batman, Superman, God and Pandas."
