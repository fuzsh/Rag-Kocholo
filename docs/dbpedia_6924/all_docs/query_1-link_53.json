        "text": "Once mostly considered a commercial composer and a mere rewriter of previous composers’ styles, only recently Williams’ music has begun to be taken seriously, and scholars from the music and the film departments have begun to produce research in the form of books, journal articles, conference papers, and Ph.D. theses. The present volume seeks to build upon, complement and review what has been written so far on Williams. This volume is a large exploration of the many sides of Williams's output, aimed at showing the range of his production (not merely focussing on film music) and at analysing the depth of his dramaturgic and compositional skills with selected case studies. To accomplish this exploration – which has not the pretence of exhaustiveness but certainly that of being an accurate survey possessing both latitude and depth – a large team of international scholars has been assembled from all around the world. The contributors come from film and music departments, to provide a variety of disciplinary perspectives on Williams's work.\n\nWhat does it mean for film music – subordinated, contingent, ‘unheard’ – to be plucked from its intended context and placed at the forefront of the listener's attention? The tradition of excerpting and arranging movie scores for the concert hall poses this question sharply. While scholarship on ‘cinematic listening’ has picked up in recent years, the specifically music-theoretical issues raised by this repertoire have been largely unaddressed. In this article, I argue that film-as-concert music presents hearing ‘cinematically’ as a valid alternative to structural modes of listening, a form of hearing that subverts both naive formalism and reflexive anti-formalism. Following a discussion of theoretical and interpretative priorities for analysing film-as-concert music, I begin investigation of a subset of the film-as-concert corpus: stand-alone scherzi originating from action set pieces. More than any other type of underscore, action cues answer to dramatic, editorial and visual imperatives rather than to ‘absolute’ logic. My core data emerges from a detailed study of John Williams's film and concert scherzi, with short analyses of cues/pieces from E.T., the Indiana Jones movies and Star Wars. My approach emphasises the way in which formal alterations bring about drastically different ways of hearing the work tonally and expressively across multiple versions. A larger-scale case study of ‘The Asteroid Field’ from The Empire Strikes Back serves to demonstrate the tonal, sectional and narratival transformations that occur between movie theatre and concert hall. To conclude, I propose that the film-as-concert mindset can be transferred to filmgoing itself, as a new mode of cinematic listening.\n\nFilm musicology is growing at a heartening pace, but the discipline is still bereft of sustained contributions from music theory. The current study seizes the opportunity presented by the under-analyzed repertoire of film music, offering an argument for applying the techniques of transformational analysis, and neo-Riemannian analysis in particular, to the interpretation of music for the moving image. Film musical style and form respond strongly to a transformational approach, which adapts well to both the triadic chromaticism characteristic of Hollywood’s harmonic practice and the dynamic and contingent condition of musical design inherent to the medium. Concurrently, the analytic tools and conceptual structure of neo-Riemannian theory benefit from exposure to a fresh repertoire with different analytic needs than those of art music. In this dissertation, the author scrutinizes the capacity for tonality to act as a unifying and dramatically potent force in film. With parameters of effective cinematic tonal design established, the adapted transformational methodology responds faithfully to the expressive and temporal qualities of the soundtrack. The author develops a model for harmonic associativity and a general hermeneutics of transformation, extrapolated from analyses of scores from John Williams, James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith, and many others. The power of the transformational approach to capture tonal phenomena through spatial representations is marshaled to perform critical readings of scores for A Beautiful Mind and Star Trek. Not only can the neo-Riemannian stance illuminate the way film music works, but it can train the listener and analyst to perceive and enjoy film with more sensitive ears.\"\"\n\nWithin the context of contemporary Hollywood film music production; this thesis explores the use and application of technology for orchestral composition, orchestral music recording, through to the final delivery and integration of music on the dubbing stage. It also looks at the impact of technology on the entire post-production process and explores alternative ways for a more integrated filmmaking experience between director and composer. This empirical research was successfully applied to the production of two Hong Kong feature film scores for Election 2 (2006) and After This Our Exile (2006) and the production of the first Hong Kong film orchestral scoring session at Shaw Studios on the 22nd of February 2007.\n\nThis dissertation investigates the collaborative process of film scoring as practiced in the films of David O. Selznick, a producer whose close attention to music distinguished him from Hollywood competitors. Drawing from extensive archival research, I examine the producer’s memos, composers’ scores, and various correspondences to trace streams of influence that shaped the musical rhetoric of Selznick’s most significant films. Close study reveals that interpretive arguments concerning these films are best grounded in a thorough knowledge of the film scores’ collaborative construction. Rather than depicting Selznick as a producer-auteur who merely imposed his ideas on composers, this dissertation views the scores from his films as sites of artistic contestation in which musical decisions made before, during, and after composition alternately reflect instances of negotiation and resistance. Selznick’s collaboration with composers Miklós Rózsa, Max Steiner, Dimitri Tiomkin, and Franz Waxman forms the centerpiece of this study, with select scores receiving special emphasis. Analysis of King Kong (1933), The Young in Heart (1938), Gone with the Wind (1939), and Rebecca (1940) shows Selznick’s growing involvement in the film scoring process and also highlights the savvy mediation of composers and music directors. Inspection of Symphony of Six Million (1932), Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), and Since You Went Away (1944) further reveals Selznick’s indebtedness to musical practices of the silent cinema. The scores for Spellbound (1945), The Paradine Case (1947), and Portrait of Jennie (1948) bear intricate collaborative tensions—often involving director Alfred Hitchcock—and receive a chapter each, allowing ample space to explore the aesthetic controversies surrounding each score’s production, promotion, and reception. In these chapters theoretical concerns, such as the relationship between music, subjectivity, and gender, gain nuance when set against the backdrop of creative collaboration. By considering issues of authorship and artistic control, this dissertation demonstrates that the scores for Selznick’s films convey a dense polyphony of ideas, revisions, and interpolations effected by composers, music editors, directors, and producer. Scrutiny of these scores and the process of their construction illuminates rarely glimpsed facets of film music production, encouraging the scholar to reconsider the social dynamics that constitute artistic collaboration in multimedia.\n\nFilm score composers are searching for unusual timbres to help define their work in a growing market. Concurrently, film scores for world cinema are gaining greater popularity while Western composers’ interest in the instruments available outside of the traditional symphony orchestra or contemporary popular ensemble increase. Film scoring is moving beyond the use of ethnographically appropriate instrumentation to enhance the audience perception of time and place. Increasingly, film score composers are turning to world music instruments without creating a sense of appropriate ethnographic association for the listener. This study explores the notion of ‘othering’ that use of an exotic timbral palette provides. The choice of alternative sonorities for the sake of novelty is also discussed. The effect of globalisation on the modern film composer has allowed an enriched palette of instruments and timbres, but consideration of world instruments in film scores enhancing a utopian view of globalisation and the negative perception of corporate culturalism is advocated.\n\nThroughout his career, John Williams has set the musical tone for the American presidency, most elaborately with his scores for Oliver Stone's controversial films JFK (1991) and Nixon (1995). While invested in capturing the character of these commanders in chief through musical codes, Williams's soundtracks are equally engaged in the act of the evocation and telling of “history.” Specifically, they construct a tragic myth of 1960s America in which the promise represented by JFK is destroyed from without, and Nixon from within, both by the malevolent forces of the military-industrial complex. In considering the thematic and dramatic means by which Williams paints his orchestral portraits, I reveal the extent to which music supports Stone's paranoiac narratives, especially in cases where the director's collage-like visual aesthetic puts pressure on the otherwise nostalgic traits of Williams's default tonal style. I offer a music-analytical approach to JFK and Nixon informed by interviews, studies of political mythology and paranoia, and musicological appraisals of Williams's music. Stone's 1960s-as-lapsarian-metanarrative positions Kennedy as a romanticized absence, an image of the fabular fallen King, and Williams renders him as a public recollection rather than a human being with interiority. Nixon, by contrast, is a tragic antihero, consumed by dark forces of history and an abundance of ambivalent thematic material. Particular attention is paid to the dismantling of Kennedy's noble leitmotif during JFK’s prologue and motorcade sequence and to the near-fascistic musical accompaniment of Nixon's speeches. Having demonstrated the active role these scores play, I conclude that Williams's music constitutes an authoring of history in a strong, albeit postmodern, sense, consistent with but independent from Stone's screenplay."
