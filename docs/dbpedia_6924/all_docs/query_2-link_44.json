        "text": "German-born composer Hans Zimmer is recognized as one of Hollywood's most innovative musical talents. He featured in the music video for The Buggles' single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\", which became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV (August 1, 1981).\n\nHans Florian Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, then in West Germany, the son of Brigitte (Weil) and Hans Joachim Zimmer. He entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film Mein wunderbarer Waschsalon (1985). He soon began work on several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed A World Apart, and during these years Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional orchestral arrangements.\n\nA turning point in Zimmer's career came in 1988 when he was asked to score Rain Man for director Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his first Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score. The next year, Zimmer composed the score for another Best Picture Oscar recipient, Miss Daisy und ihr Chauffeur (1989), starring Jessica Tandy, and Morgan Freeman.\n\nHaving already scored two Best Picture winners, in the early 1990s, Zimmer cemented his position as a preeminent talent with the award-winning score for Der König der Löwen (1994). The soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date and earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score, a Golden Globe, an American Music Award, a Tony, and two Grammy Awards. In total, Zimmer's work has been nominated for 7 Golden Globes, 7 Grammys and seven Oscars for Rain Man (1988), Gladiator (2000), Der König der Löwen (1994), Besser geht's nicht (1997), The Rendezvous mit einem Engel (1996), Der schmale Grat (1998), Der Prinz von Ägypten (1998), and Last Samurai (2003).\n\nWith his career in full swing, Zimmer was anxious to replicate the mentoring experience he had benefited from under Stanley Myers' guidance. With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa Monica-based musical \"think tank.\" This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith, and Klaus Badelt.\n\nIn 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Gladiator (2000), for which he received an Oscar nomination, in addition to Golden Globe and Broadcast Film Critics Awards for his epic score. It sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album Gladiator: More Music From The Motion Picture, released on the Universal Classics/Decca label. Zimmer's other scores that year included Mission: Impossible II (2000), Der Weg nach El Dorado (2000), and Mit oder ohne - Was Männer haben sollten (2000), directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nSome of his other impressive scores include Pearl Harbor (2001), Ring (2002), four films directed by Ridley Scott; Tricks (2003), Hannibal (2001), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Thelma & Louise (1991), Penny Marshall's Unterwegs mit Jungs (2001), and Eine Klasse für sich (1992), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), Tränen der Sonne (2003), Ron Howard's Backdraft - Männer, die durchs Feuer gehen (1991), Tage des Donners (1990), Fräulein Smillas Gespür für Schnee (1997), and the animated Spirit - Der wilde Mustang (2002) for which he also co-wrote four of the songs with Bryan Adams, including the Golden Globe nominated Here I Am.\n\nAt the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival, Zimmer performed live for the first time in concert with a 100-piece orchestra and a 100-voice choir. Choosing selections from his impressive body of work, Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of Gladiator, Mission: Impossible II (2000), Rain Man (1988), Der König der Löwen (1994), and Der schmale Grat (1998). The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled \"The Wings Of A Film: The Music Of Hans Zimmer.\"\n\nIn 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score for the film The Last Samurai, starring Tom Cruise, for which he received both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination. Zimmer then scored Nancy Meyers' comedy Was das Herz begehrt (2003), the animated Dreamworks film, Große Haie - Kleine Fische (2004) (featuring voices of Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, and Martin Scorsese), and Jim Brooks' Spanglish (2004) starring Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni (for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination). His 2005 projects include Paramount's The Weather Man (2005) starring Nicolas Cage, Dreamworks' Madagascar (2005), and the Warner Bros. summer release, Batman Begins (2005).\n\nZimmer's additional honors and awards include the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, and the Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He has also received ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement. Hans and his wife live in Los Angeles and he is the father of four children.\n\nIn his ongoing, decades-long career as a composer, Alan Silvestri has blazed an innovative trail with his exciting and melodic scores, winning the applause of Hollywood and movie audiences the world over. With a credit list of over 100 films Silvestri has composed some of the most recognizable and beloved themes in movie history. His efforts have been recognized with two Oscar nominations, two Golden Globe nominations, three Grammy awards, two Emmy awards, and numerous International Film Music Critics Awards, Saturn Awards, and Hollywood Music In Media Awards.\n\nBorn in New York City and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, Silvestri first dreamed of becoming a jazz guitar player. After spending two years at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, he hit the road as a performer and arranger. Landing in Hollywood at the age of 22, he found himself successfully composing the music for 1972's \"The Doberman Gang\" which established his place in the world of film composing.\n\nThe 1970s witnessed the rise of energetic synth-pop scores, establishing Silvestri as the action rhythmatist for TV's highway patrol hit \"CHiPs.\" This action driven score caught the ear of a young filmmaker named Robert Zemeckis, whose hit film, 1984's \"Romancing the Stone,\" was the perfect first date for the composer and director. It's success became the basis of a decades long collaboration that continues to this day. Their numerous collaborations have taken them through fascinating landscapes and stylistic variations, from the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy to the jazzy world of Toontown in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" the tension filled rooms of \"What Lies Beneath\" and \"Death Becomes Her\", to the cosmic wonder of \"Contact;\" the emotional isolation of \"Castaway\", to the magic of the \"Polar Express\". But perhaps no film collaboration defines their creative relationship better than Zemeckis' 1994 Best Picture winner, \"Forrest Gump\", for which Silvestri's gift for melodically beautiful themes earned him an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination and the affection of film music lovers everywhere. This 35 year, 21 film collaboration includes such recent films as \"Flight\", \"Allied\" and most recently \"Welcome To Marwen\". Zemeckis and Silvestri are currently working on \"The Witches\" based on Roald Dahl's 1973 classic book scheduled for release in October of 2020.\n\nThough the Zemeckis/Silvestri collaboration is legendary, Silvestri has scored films of every imaginable style and genre. His energy has brought excitement and emotion to the hard-hitting orchestral scores for Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One\", James Cameron's \"The Abyss\" as well as \"Predator\" and \"The Mummy Returns.\" Alan's diversity is on full display in family entertainment films such as \"The Father of the Bride 1 and 2\", \"Parent Trap\", \"Stuart Little 1 and 2\", Disney's \"Lilo and Stitch\", \"The Croods\" as well as \"Night at the Museum 1, 2 and 3\" while his passion for melody fuels the romantic emotion of films like \"The Bodyguard\" and \"What Women Want\".\n\nMost recently, Alan has composed the music for Marvel's \"Avengers: Endgame.\" The film is the culmination of a partnership with Marvel that began in 2011 with Alan's dynamically heroic score for \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" followed by \"Avengers\". Since 2011 Alan's collaboration with Marvel helped propel \"The Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War\" to spectacular world-wide success.\n\nSilvestri's success has also crossed into the world of songwriting. His partnership with Six-Time Grammy Award winner Glen Ballard has produced hits such as the Grammy-winning and Oscar-nominated song \"Believe\" (Josh Groban) for \"The Polar Express\", \"Butterfly Fly Away\" (Miley Cyrus) for \"Hannah Montana The Movie\", \"God Bless Us Everyone\" (Andrea Bocelli) for \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"A Hero Comes Home\" (Idina Menzel) for \"Beowulf\".\n\nAlan and his wife Sandra are long time residents of California's central coast. In 1998 the Silvestri family embarked on a new venture as the founders of Silvestri Vineyards. Their wines show that lovingly cultivated fruit has a music all its own. \"There's something about the elemental side of winemaking that appeals to me,\" he says. \"Both music making and wine making involve a magical blending of art and science. Just as each note brings it own voice to the melody, each vine brings it's own unique personality to the wine.\"\n\nTheir other great passion is the ongoing search for the cure to Type 1 Juvenile Diabetes. With the diagnosis of their son at two years of age (now 29) they continue to work the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and dream of the day this disease (and all of the suffering it brings to so many) will finally become a thing of the past.\n\nHenry Jackman has established himself as one of today's top composers by fusing his classical training with his experience as a successful record producer and creator of electronic music.\n\nJackman grew up in the southeast of England, where he began composing his first symphony at the age of six. He studied classical music at Oxford and sang in the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir-but simultaneously got involved in the underground rave scene and began producing popular electronica music and dance remixes, eventually working with artists such as Seal and The Art of Noise.\n\nIn 2006 he caught the attention of film composers Hans Zimmer and John Powell, and began writing additional music for Powell on Kung Fu Panda and then for Zimmer on The Dark Knight, The Da Vinci Code, and The Pirates of the Caribbean films, which rapidly led to scoring blockbuster films on his own. His first solo feature film then came to be 'Monsters v Aliens' directed by Rob Letterman.\n\n\"I've spent a lot of time working in the record industry,\" says Jackman, \"and for my money being a film composer is way more fun. You can be working on X-Men, and then a movie set in 17th-century Italy. It's not about showing off what you think is cool or what you want to hear, but 'what is this movie about, and what would best serve it?' That process just leads to strange and remarkable places.\"\n\nJackman is known for his recent scores for Marvel Studios' 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier', Showtime's 'The Comey Rule', The Russo Brothers' 'Cherry', as well as 'Jumanji: The Next Level', a continuation of the magical board game adventure story, and 'Detective Pikachu', following the story of the beloved Pikachu Pokémon character starring Ryan Reynolds. His other recent work includes 'Ralph Breaks the Internet', which was nominated for Best Animated Feature. His other diverse credits include Captain America: Civil War, Kong: Skull Island, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Big Hero 6, and Kingsman: The Golden Circle.\n\nBorn on February 10, 1929, Jerry Goldsmith studied piano with Jakob Gimpel and composition, theory, and counterpoint with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He also attended classes in film composition given by Miklós Rózsa at the Univeristy of Southern California. In 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. There, he was given his first embryonic assignments as a composer for radio shows such as \"Romance\" and \"CBS Radio Workshop\". He wrote one score a week for these shows, which were performed live on transmission. He stayed with CBS until 1960, having already scored Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). He was hired by Revue Studios to score their series Thriller (1960). It was here that he met the influential film composer Alfred Newman who hired Goldsmith to score the film Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), his first major feature film score. An experimentalist, Goldsmith constantly pushed forward the bounds of film music: Planet der Affen (1968) included horns blown without mouthpieces and a bass clarinetist fingering the notes but not blowing. He was unafraid to use the wide variety of electronic sounds and instruments which had become available, although he did not use them for their own sake.\n\nHe rose rapidly to the top of his profession in the early to mid-1960s, with scores such as Freud (1962), Träumende Lippen (1965) and Kanonenboot am Yangtse-Kiang (1966). In fact, he received Oscar nominations for all three and another in the 1960s for Planet der Affen (1968). From then onwards, his career and reputation was secure and he scored an astonishing variety of films during the next 30 years or so, from Patton: Rebell in Uniform (1970) to Star Trek - Der Film (1979) and from Chinatown (1974) to The Boys from Brazil - Geheimakte Viertes Reich (1978). He received 17 Oscar nominations but won only once, for Das Omen (1976) in 1977 (Goldsmith himself dismissed the thought of even getting a nomination for work on a \"horror show\"). He enjoyed giving concerts of his music and performed all over the world, notably in London, where he built up a strong relationship with London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nJerry Goldsmith died at age 75 on July 21, 2004 after a long battle with cancer.\n\nKnown for his wide-ranging talents, Mark Mancina's film scores traverse almost every genre: drama, action, comedy, suspense, and period epic. His dark, edgy music for the Oscar-winning Training Day (2001), is a benchmark score that expanded the boundaries of scoring street-wise drama, and is widely used as a temp track, while his breakout score for Speed (1994), another innovative work, influenced the sound of subsequent action movies. Mancina's orchestral originality on Für das Leben eines Freundes (1998), reflecting the haunting gloom of its subject, and his score for the period epic Moll Flanders (1996), which appeared on Billboard's Classical Crossover Chart, further point to Mancina's considerable compositional range. Other films include Twister (1996), Bad Boys - Harte Jungs (1995), Con Air (1997), Tödliches Vertrauen (2001), Tarzan (1999), Bärenbrüder (2003), Die Geistervilla (2003), and Sony's 3-D animated short, Early Bloomer (2003).\n\nBut Mancina's achievements as composer for some of the top-grossing films of recent years comprise only one aspect of his diverse career. Composer, producer, songwriter and three-time Grammy winner, he has also added Broadway to his list of accomplishments by writing, producing and arranging the score for Disney's Tony-winning stage production of The Lion King. The foundation for this expansion into theatre was set in the early 1990s when Oscar winning composer Hans Zimmer, recognizing Mancina's varied gifts, asked him to arrange and produce three Elton John songs for what would become the enormously successful original film version of The Lion King. Mancina's efforts on \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight,\" \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" and \"Hakuna Matata\" were rewarded with a multi-platinum record that has sold over ten million copies worldwide, and earned him a Grammy for Best Musical Album for Children and two American Music Awards for Best Pop Album. On the heels of the success of Der König der Löwen (1994), Mancina went on to write and produce additional songs for a Lion King follow-up album entitled Rhythm of the Pridelands featuring South African artist 'Lebo M'. One of Mancina's original songs, \"He Lives In You,\" became a thematic centerpiece for The Lion King theatrical production which opened on Broadway in 1997, and has since been performed to great acclaim in numerous cities around the world. In his role as producer of music for the stage, Mancina collaborated with 'Lebo M', and director Julie Taymor to create the distinctive musical atmosphere of the Tony award winning show. Mancina received a Tony nomination, was awarded Britain's Ivor Novello Award for the London production, and earned his second Grammy for producing the Original Broadway Cast Album.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Mancina spent his childhood in Culver City, then Huntington Beach, California. Commencing his musical training at a very early age, he has performed all his life as a singer, guitarist and pianist. His film and television scores frequently feature Mancina's own performances on piano, guitar, bass, percussion, and drums, highlighting unique sounds harvested from a personal collection of traditional, exotic, and custom instruments from all over the world.\n\nAfter studying composition and performance as a classical guitar major at Cal State Fullerton, he went on to perform on Trevor Rabin's solo tour, and later to write and produce for Yes. He also worked on several records with producer Trevor Horn, including the song \"Crazy,\" performed by Grammy-winning artist Seal. In 1990, Mancina moved from Los Angeles to London for a year to work with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, producing and composing their \"Black Moon\" album for PolyGram. More recently, he has composed and arranged songs with Kenny Loggins. His extensive partnership with Phil Collins includes Disney's animated hit Tarzan (1999), for which Mancina composed the score and co-produced several Collins songs. The ballad \"You'll Be In My Heart,\" which Mancina arranged and co-produced, won the Oscar for Best Song. They renewed their collaborative efforts for the recent Brother Bear for which Mancina co-produced songs and co-composed the dramatic score. In addition to his work in film, theatre and the recording industry, Mancina also writes score and themes for many television projects, which have included \"The Outer Limits,\" \"Poltergeist,\" \"Millennium,\" \"Lifepod,\" and HBO's \"From the Earth to the Moon.\" Among his countless television commercial clients are Nike, Mountain Dew, Jaguar, Skittles, McDonald's, Verizon, Computer Associates, Goodyear, The U.S. Army, American Express and AT&T. Working from his studio in Pasadena, and his home studio, a mountaintop farmhouse/barn, he continues to expand his repertoire, and is currently developing songs for musicals and films.\n\nAtli Örvarsson (b. 1970) is an acclaimed Icelandic film and TV composer, conductor, and musician. His body of work spans over 40 major studio film productions, countless TV shows, collaborations with a range of artists including RZA, Khalid, Talos, and orchestral conducting, and ambitious solo work.\n\nAtli was born and raised in the town of Akureyri in North Iceland. He lived and worked in Los Angeles for many years, feeling a call to return to his homeland in 2016. The move brought him full circle, and heralded a renewed sense of creative freedom, and an exciting new chapter in his storied career.\n\nSince his return, Atli has worked with the Sinfonia Nord orchestra to put Akureyri on the map as an international destination for recording film scores. He founded the thriving INNI label / studios to help bring talented Icelandic artists to a wider audience, and continued his creative evolution with the release of his expansive 2020 solo debut, 'You Are Here'.\n\nAtli's journey in music began early. At age five, his musical aptitude was noticed by a relative who gave an open invitation for a music lesson, for which he showed up bright and early at 10am the next morning. In his teens, he played in a professional theatre ensemble, and earned several gold and platinum discs with the band Sálin hans Jóns míns.\n\nSetting out to broaden his horizons, Atli undertook a degree at Boston's Berklee College of Music, and felt his calling as a film composer. He explored the synergies and subtleties of composing for the screen, going further during his Masters at the University of North Carolina. A move to Los Angeles was the natural next step. Atli quickly found good company, honing his craft alongside prolific TV composer Mike Post, and Hollywood legend Hans Zimmer.\n\nSince then, Atli has become one of Iceland's foremost screen composers, winning the HARPA Nordic Film Composer Award for his acclaimed score to 'Rams', and several ASCAP and BMI Film and TV Music Awards. In 2009, he was nominated as the Breakthrough of the Year at the IFMCA Awards, and Discovery of the Year by the World Soundtrack Academy. In 2019, his score for 'Ploey: You Never Fly Alone' was nominated for a Public Choice Award.\n\nThe path ahead will be an exciting one. The view from the top of the world, just miles from the Arctic Circle, has given Atli a new sense of purpose. With the fertile creative ground he has cultivated, a steady flow of film and TV projects in the works, and the rich possibilities of the INNI organisation, the sky seems the limit.\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams is one of Hollywood's most sought-after and prolific composers whose long list of film and television credits underscore the diverse range of his talents. He most recently wrote the music for \"The Last Duel\" and \"House of Gucci\" both directed by Ridley Scott. In addition, he wrote the music for Disney's live action feature film \"Mulan\" which was directed by Niki Caro with whom he worked previously having scored her film \"The Zookeeper's Wife.\" Gregson-Williams also co-wrote the original song \"Loyal Brave True\" for \"Mulan\" performed by Christina Aguilera. He and his brother, composer Rupert Gregson-Williams, wrote the original score for both seasons 1 & 2 of the HBO drama series \"The Gilded Age\".
