        "text": "Breakout composer Andrea Datzman (INSIDE OUT 2) talks about her initial rejection from film scoring industry, and what led her to persevere. How her struggle with Lyme disease threatened to upend her initial breakthrough with Michael Giacchino on INSIDE OUT, and led to a surprising new revelation about her own brain and neuropsychology. She also discusses her experience learning from Michael Giacchino as a student, during the scoring sessions for ABC’s LOST. Interview by Robert Kraft and Kenny Holmes.\n\nComposer Andrew Lockington (ATLAS, MAYOR OF KINGSTOWN) joins SCORE to talk about Toronto, working with and under the tutelage of fellow Canadian Mychael Danna after wanting to start a rock band, and how his interest in orchestration led to his composing breakthroughs. Plus, working with Jennifer Lopez, creating “suites” of music, what makes temps so tricky to work with, and how he’s built a relationship with director Brad Peyton across multiple big-budget action films. Interview by Kenny Holmes and Robert Kraft.\n\nWe catch up with composer extraordinaire Christophe Beck (UNFROSTED, ROAD HOUSE) for the first time in six years! Christophe shares how early piano lessons led to dreams of making his own album (now in the works). Plus, how years leading a composer team on major films refreshed his love of teaching and sharing, his creative rapport with director Doug Liman, and working with comedy icon Jerry Seinfeld in his directorial debut on the Netflix satire/“Pop Tart biopic” UNFROSTED. Interview by Kenny Holmes, Matt Schrader, and Robert Kraft.\n\nComposer Chris Benstead talks about being Guy Ritchies’ musical maestro on multiple projects, including THE GENTLEMEN on Netflix and THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE. How his musical education led him into music mixing and eventually working in the “sound” departments on major projects, before his work with Patrick Doyle, Steven Price, Alan Menken and Hans Zimmer brought him back into the “composer” role for Guy Ritchie. Why Guy sometimes asks him to be “braver” with a cue, and how to delegate (aka “let go”) of certain parts of the music composition process that you’re good at. Interview by Kenny Holmes and Matt Schrader.\n\nYouTuber Rudy Mancuso has been following SCORE for years, as a musician and composer in his own right. He joins Kenny Holmes and Matt Schrader to discuss his breakout hit film from SxSW ‘MÚSICA’ out now on Prime Video — a semi-autobiographic film, years in the making, that pushes musical possibilities to refreshingly brilliant musical storytelling. Directed as only a composer could, MÚSICA (also starring Camila Mendes and J.B. Smoove) is an exploration of synesthesia, in which Rudy experiences real life in semi-musical form. Rudy discusses how his content creator life was the perfect practice for navigating his own feature film, why puppets (yes, puppets) are so integral to his film, and why he never had any doubt he would direct AND compose the music himself.\n\nThe Miami-based Carlos Rafael Rivera with two series releasing now (Griselda, Monsieur Spade) joins to talk about his massive breakout with The Queen’s Gambit, followed by Hacks and Lessons in Chemistry. Why Sofia Vergara's dramatic turn as a drug kingpin in Miami deserved an operative approach. How he manages to maintain his Miami location for an industry that is largely located in Los Angeles. Plus, he revisits his 2017 adventure to go see Score: A Film Music Documentary in New York, and how he’s brought some of his teaching skills (and musicians) into his music work.\n\nBefore that, Kenny and Matt break down the Oscar nominees, as Robert joins a few minutes later to explain why Oppenheimer’s score (by Ludwig Gorannsson) is so groundbreakingly original.\n\nOne of the original members of the indie band Arcade Fire, Richard Reed Parry (THE IRON CLAW, EILEEN) discusses his jump into film scoring, the importance of finding “mojo” and “vibe,” and how the wrestling biopic The Iron Claw nearly stumped him musically — until he unlocked the rich, layered sound that carries the film. How Spike Jonze’s film “Her” prepared him for the next stage in his career, and why he believes it’s important to be as musically dynamic with other musicians as possible.\n\nGeoff Zanelli makes his long-awaited Score debut after one of Netflix’s most watched animated films of all-time, the Adam Sandler-produced LEO. In this episode, Kenny and Robert discuss the long-awaited arrival of MAESTRO, the Leonard Bernstein biopic, which we discussed on the 2nd episode of SCORE: THE PODCAST back when it was to be directed by Spielberg. Then, Robert and Geoff reminisce about drinking absinthe in Paris, before jumping into the challenge of making Adam Sandler laugh, and the paradox of writing “funny” music in animation. Plus, Geoff talks about his path from music school to being an intern at Hans Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions in the early (Lion King era) 1990s, sitting in on Alan Meyerson mixes, and getting his first opportunities while working for John Powell on the movie Face/Off.\n\nComposer of the new historical epic NAPOLEON Martin Phipps joins Score for the first time! How he located a piano once owned by Napoleon himself for the score. Plus, his path to film and television music, his work on Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror and The Crown, and establishing trust with the great Ridley Scott. How Martin overcame his early doubts about musical approach for NAPOLEON to meet its spectacular giant sets, and musically signaling Napoleon as an ambitious outsider rising to power.\n\nInterview by Robert Kraft and Kenny Holmes.\n\nScore season 5 returns with composer James Newton Howard, who currently has four projects releasing this month, including the Hunger Games prequel that he says asked him not to use synths (“they haven’t been invented yet”). Plus, how working with Hans Zimmer helped pull him out of a period of depression, when to fight for your musical opinion, and why he likes the rush of being asked to “save” blockbuster films in the final weeks before release. Interviewed by Robert Kraft and Matt Schrader.\n\nLive podcast recording with composer Colin Stetson from Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards in Belgium.\n\nComposer and musician Colin Stetson is a nominee for the WSA Discovery of the Year Award, and sits down with Robert Kraft to talk about how he keeps his music fresh, his musical mind healthy and his performing career exciting. They also discuss his recent work, including THE MENU and HEREDITARY.\n\nRecorded on location by Film Fest Gent in front of a live audience in October 2023.\n\nAcademy Award-winning composer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist Gustavo Santaolalla joins Score: The Podcast for a lively conversation about the phenomenon his music helped create in The Last of Us, and why it's different than any of his other work. Plus, writing the score to Brokeback Mountain prior to anything being filmed, how the records he made with the band Arco Iris (at age 18) become a blueprint for his career, and how he put the instrument \"ronroco\" on the map. Gustavo also shares details about his upcoming projects, including a performance in October at the World Soundtrack Awards in Ghent, Belgium, where he will be with our own Robert Kraft.\n\nOscar-winning composer Hildur Guðnadóttir talks about her 2019 success on JOKER and CHERNOBYL and how she responded to pandemic slowdown at the breakout moment of her career. Why becoming a mother is something she holds so dearly and credits for some of her approach. Plus, why WOMEN TALKING challenged her to find a quiet inner strength, and TÁR created a mirror opposite of Hildur's approach to her music. Interview by Robert Kraft and Matt Schrader.\n\nSpecial Episode! Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle sits down with his composer Justin Hurwitz ahead of their new film, BABYLON. Why Chazelle involves his composer long before his script is \"final,\" and how he uses it to create storyboards. How the music of WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND were informed by music, and the challenges of bringing to life the 1920s-era BABYLON with all its brilliant, raucous and cacophonous musical splendor. Interview by Robert Kraft and Matt Schrader.\n\nComposer Gabriel Mann talks through his decision to leave Pre-Med in college to become a musician — and why his parents fully supported him. Then, how working with David Schwartz led to him leaving composer altogether — and why David brought him back to collaborate on ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. Later, we talk about writing lyrical melodies for A MILLION LITTLE THINGS, why Disney's musical machine is so vast, and a top-secret musical stage play in the works now (based on an 1980s classic) from Gabriel's band, The Rescues, coming in 2023. Interview by Matt Schrader.\n\nThe great David Newman has been scoring memorable and iconic films since the mid-1980s, and after his own prolific career has found himself being a part of a unique world — live film music concerts. From conducting John Williams concerts at the world-famous Hollywood Bowl, to conducting orchestras live-to-picture at Walt Disney Concert Hall, David has stumbled into a world of new opportunities.
