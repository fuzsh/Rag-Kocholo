This year will mark the 10th Anniversary of the Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award, bestowed each year by the City of Vienna to one of the world’s most renowned film music composers, as a symbol of recognition for exceptional achievements in the art of film music.\n\nSeveral of Zimmer’s most iconic film compositions will be performed live and for the first time ever in a classic concert hall. Some of the pieces will be with new orchestral arrangements by the composer himself, performed by the renowned ORF Radio Symphony Orchestra. Compositions of box office hits such as Da Vinci Code, Inception, Gladiator, and Pirates of the Caribbean will be part of the program, as well as the romantic comedy Holiday and the WWII movie Pearl Harbor, to name just a few. The titles are also part of the current “The World of Hans Zimmer” tour, where Sandra Tomek and her team were responsible for the artistic production and producers Hans Zimmer’s company Remote Control and tour specialist Semmel Concerts.\n\nPrior recipients of the Max Steiner Award include Danny Elfman (2017), Alexandre Desplat (2016), James Newton Howard (2015), Randy Newman (2014), the late James Horner (2013), Lalo Schifrin (2012), Alan Silvestri (2011), Howard Shore (2010), and John Barry (2009).\n\nZimmer has scored more than 150 projects across all mediums, which, combined, have grossed more than 28 billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Zimmer has been honored with an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, three GRAMMYs, an American Music Award, and a Tony Award Zimmer most recently co-scored the critically acclaimed “Blade Runner 2049” alongside Benjamin Wallfisch, which earned the pair BAFTA and Critics’ Choice nominations for Best Score. Additionally, Zimmer created the score for Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk”, for which he was nominated for multiple awards including an Academy Award, Grammy Award, Golden Globe, BAFTA Award, and Critics’ Choice Award. Other notable scores of Zimmer’s include “Gladiator”, “The Thin Red Line”, “As Good as It Gets”, “Rain Man”, “The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”, “Thelma and Louise”, “Black Hawk Down” and “The Last Samurai”. Last summer, Zimmer completed a highly successful, critically acclaimed tour across Europe and the U.S.\n\nHollywood in Vienna was founded in 2007 by Sandra Tomek (Tomek Productions). The symphonic gala concert celebrates classic and current masterpieces of film music. During the course of the gala concert, the City of Vienna awards one of today’s leading film music composers with the Max Steiner Film Music Achievement Award.
