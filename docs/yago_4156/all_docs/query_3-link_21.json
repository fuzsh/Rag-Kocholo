        "text": "Napoleon Dynamite\n\nA documentary about cinematic relics that itself has become outdated, when Kevin Brownlow made this TV program on silent-era French filmmaker Abel Gance, he was closer in time to the three films of Gance's covered here--\"J'Accuse!\" (1919), \"La Roue\" (1923) and \"Napoléon\" (1927)--than we are today, in 2021, to this 1968 production. Heck, almost a century on, we're nearly as far removed now from Gance's \"Napoléon\" as Gance and his film were from the actual Napoleon Bonaparte. Fortunately, too, film preservationists and scholars like Brownlow have expanded our understanding of silent cinema and restored more extant prints of those three Gance pictures since 1968.

If The…\n\nI'd rather you read my review of Napoleon but I'll give some thoughts here.\n\nChose to watch this little doc that Kevin Brownlow did after seeing the big silent film beast in the cinema. It was amazing to see that there was some behind-the-scenes from the shooting of Napoleon. Seeing how so much of this incorporated a DIY approach to filmmaking – building your own designs to take the camera off the tripod, putting a camera operator on the back of the bicycle and wheeling him in front of an angry mob – and how it adds to the immense scale of the film.\n\nA lot of this is outdated because by this point the reconstruction hadn't been complete, but…"
