        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Annette Insdorf, who teaches film at Yale University, was Abel Gance's translator at the Telluride Film Festival. By ANNETTE INSDORF\n\nThe provocative combination of Napoleon Bonaparte, a pioneering filmmaker, an indefatigable film scholar and an enthusiastic advocate named Francis Ford Coppola requires an appropriate stage on which the dramatic history of nations as well as films can be played out. These individuals - Corsican, French, British, and American respectively - have found their site: Radio City Music Hall, where the reconstructed version of Abel Gance's groundbreaking 1927 ''Napoleon'' will have its New York premiere Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe film, prized by scholars and other filmmakers for its innovative techniques, traces the career of Napoleon from his school days to his military triumphs. It is also a love story in which the hero of the battlefield is reduced to a fumbling swain.\n\nAccompanying the silent classic will be a new score by Mr. Coppola's father, Carmine Coppola, who won an Academy Award in 1975 with Nino Rota for their original dramatic score for ''Godfather II.'' The senior Coppola will all also conduct the 60-piece American Symphony Orchestra. Radio City's orchestra pit is not the only space that will be crowded, as the projection of this 4 1/2-hour film - now acclaimed a masterpiece - requires a number of hands: the last reel of ''Napoleon'' is in Polyvision, a three-camera, threeprojection, three-screen process invented by Mr. Gance in the 1920's (anticipating Cinerama by 30 years) to accommodate his sweeping vision of both history and cinema.\n\nIn the opinion of film historians, the boldness, scale and influence of ''Napoleon'' in film art rival those of its central character on the battlefield. Filmmakers from various countries and generations will be attending the screenings, as ''Napoleon'' makes use of an immense cinematic vocabulary: by 1927, Mr. Gance had taken superimposition, rapid cutting and camera mobility to a new level of development.\n\nThese very factors made - and continue to make -''Napoleon'' a difficult film to distribute, and for more than 50 years existing copies were ineptly shortened, mutilated, or merely ignored. Bad timing was part of the problem: six months after the film's premiere, ''The Jazz Singer'' sounded the death knell for purely visual storytelling. Talkies were in; Mr. Gance's swirling camera and rapid-fire editing were out.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
