It blends documentary and re-enactment in a way that you can never really tell what's the crew and what's the actors in a scene, and it's fitting since the film itself is a huge sci-fi spectacle that in itself was a technical marvel. I like how French filmmakers of this period always flirted with sci-fi elements at some point, so this is sort of a relic of its time in its way as well\n\nFor Gance nerds this is a treat, and I'm served"
