        "text": "[Blind Gossip] If you were around in the 1990s, you certainly remember this popular sitcom.\n\nIt ran for many years and was praised for its family-friendly nature.\n\nOne of the stars of that show has had an interesting life since then.\n\nOur actor started out as a teen on the show and expanded his talents past acting to include a music career.\n\nIt wasn’t all smooth sailing, though. We think there is a mug shot of him somewhere out there.\n\nHis love life has also been… interesting.\n\nHe has been married more than once. He says that he and his partner are completely committed to each other.\n\nHowever, there may be a little glitch in that plan.\n\nIn addition to his female partner, he has been having a relationship with… a pre-op transgender woman!\n\nIt turns out that this is not a new experience for him.\n\nOh, please! He has been f*cking pre-ops for years! Everyone in the trans community knows this. So he can pretend that he is straight and that they are “just friends” and he is so woke and that she is chasing clout all he wants but the truth will come out.\n\nHe is denying this relationship because he doesn’t want to admit that having this on the side is “his thing.”\n\nSo to have a female partner AND a pre-op trans lover on the side at the same time is just “his thing.”\n\nAny tapes out there? Yes.\n\nWhat is he going to do? Claim that he was drunk? Pretend that it was staged?\n\nIt will be interesting to see if this not-so-family-friendly activity matters to his partner.\n\nDoes she still think that marriage to him is a good idea?\n\nSimilar: The Bearding Games\n\nActor/TV Show:\n\nClues:\n\n[Optional] What do you think his partner will do?"
