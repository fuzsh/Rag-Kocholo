        "text": "American actor, rapper, producer (born 1976)\n\nDarius Creston McCrary (born May 1, 1976) is an American actor, singer and producer. McCrary is known for his role as Edward \"Eddie\" Winslow, the oldest child of Carl and Harriette Winslow on the ABC/CBS television sitcom Family Matters, which ran from 1989–1998.[2]\n\nHe also played Scam in the 1987 comedy film Big Shots, which was his film debut. He provided the voice of Jazz in Transformers (2007). From December 2009 to October 2011, he portrayed photographer Malcolm Winters on the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless.\n\nMcCrary began his career as a child actor and made his film debut in the 1987 comedy Big Shots. He also appeared in guest spots in episodic television and had a role in the 1988 film Mississippi Burning before landing the role of Eddie Winslow in Family Matters the following year.[3][4] After Family Matters ended its run in 1998, McCrary co-starred in the short-lived UPN series Freedom. In 2000, he had a lead role as Tommy in \"Something to Sing About\", a Christian drama produced by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. In 2001, he appeared in 15 Minutes opposite Robert De Niro and Kingdom Come, with Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nIn April and May 2006, McCrary reunited with his Family Matters co-star Kellie Shanygne Williams as Jamal on UPN's Eve for two episodes. In 2007, he was the voice of Jazz in the movie Transformers. In 2009, he voiced Tarix in Bionicle: The Legend Reborn. McCrary also had film roles in Next Day Air, Saw VI, and in national stage play productions such as The Maintenance Man. That December, he joined the cast of the CBS daytime drama The Young and the Restless. McCrary portrayed Malcolm Winters, a role originated by Shemar Moore.[5] Joined on the series by his former Family Matters co-star Bryton James (né McClure), McCrary left The Young and the Restless in October 2011. McCrary's first album was also released the same year.\n\nOn January 6, 2010, McCrary appeared as himself in an episode of I Get That a Lot on CBS. He was pumping gas, and Paris Hilton was pretending to be a clerk at the gas station. She recognized him and asked for his autograph. He thought it was her and after she confessed who she was, he said he thought she was doing community service. McCrary later starred in the stage play In-Laws From Hell written, directed, and produced by Andrionna L. Williams.\n\nMcCrary is the founder of Fathers Care, a non-profit organization under the McCrary Foundation umbrella, started by his father, aunts and uncles,cousins also known as The McCrarys.\n\nIn 2015, he was arrested and held in custody for failure to pay child support, but was released after two hours when he paid the full $5,500 in back support owed.[6] On November 27, 2023, McCrary was arrested a second time on felony charges of failure to pay child support of over $52,000 as of March 2019. He pleaded not guilty, and his bond was set at $13,197.01, according to court documents.[7]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1987 Big Shots Jeremy \"Scam\" Henderson 1988 Mississippi Burning Aaron Williams 1995 Kidz in the Wood Tootooe TV movie 1997 Don King: Only in America Muhammad Ali TV movie 1998 Park Day Andre Simmons 1999 The Breaks Shaquan 2000 Something to Sing About Tommy TV movie 2001 Kingdom Come Royce Slocumb 15 Minutes Detective Tommy Cullen 2002 Vampires: Los Muertos Ray Collins Hostage FBI Commander Darius Jackson Short 2004 The Maintenance Man Malcolm Tremell Video 2006 Da Jammies Dean Cransbury (voice) Video 2007 Transformers Jazz (Voice) 2009 Next Day Air Buddy Steppin: The Movie Sinis Saw VI Dave 2010 Church Daniel 2011 35 and Ticking Nick West The Perfect Gift Darren Smith He's Mine Not Yours William Houndz from Hell Extract 2013 24 Hour Love Vernon Will a Man Rob God?
