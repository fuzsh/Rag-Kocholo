        "text": "There are tons of people who don’t consider Karrine Steffans a credible source; but, at this point, she’s not the only woman who’s accused Darius McCrary of being physically abusive in a romantic relationship.\n\nRecently, his wife Tammy Brawner filled legal documents alleging McCrary terrorized both her and their child by holding the little girl over a pot of boiling water. In the documents, she requested and was granted a restraining order.\n\nThe documents stated that the incident happened on February 10 when Darius McCrary began hurling picture frames and other objects around their home. She claimed he even hit her in the head with his forearm. She says some of the objects came close to striking their 16-month-old daughter Zoey.\n\nTammy said that McCrary has abused their daughter on numerous occasions, including one time when he held her over a pot of boiling water, saying he wished he’d never had her. Brawner said that McCrary frequently spanked the child and had strapped her arms down during meal times.\n\nTammy said that McCrary has a problem with drugs and alcohol and frequently comes home intoxicated and violent.\n\nA judge granted Brawner’s request for the restraining order and ordered Darius McCrary to move out of the home. He must stay 100 yards away from both Tammy and their daughter. He’s also been barred from visitation until a court hearing next month.\n\nMcCrary responded to the allegations on social media with a series of pictures.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1OxVklEpJ/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1WCKwl6VT/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQ1kEq0lO8Y/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQ18sOBlQ5V/\n\nThis is McCrary’s third marriage. In 2005, he married Las Vegas showgirl Juliette Vann. The couple divorced in 2006. In 2009, he married former video vixen and author Karrine Steffans. They split in 2011, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nMcCrary married Brawner, a former Harlem Globetrotter, in 2014.\n\nAfter McCrary’s series of photos, Brawner shared a response of her own."
