        "text": "Background\n\nDarius McCrary was born in Walnut, California, on May 1, 1976. He was born in the United States and is of African-American descent. His father, Howard McCrary, was a composer, singer, and music director. He has a younger brother, Donovan McCrary, who is also an actor.\n\nCareer\n\nMcCrary began his career as a child actor, starring in the 1987 comedy Big Shots. He also had cameo appearances on episodic television and starred in the film Mississippi Burning in 1988 before winning the part of Eddie Winslow in Family Matters the following year. McCrary co-starred in the short-lived UPN sitcom Freedom after Family Matters concluded in 1998. In 2000, he played Tommy in the Billy Graham Association's Christian drama \"Something to Sing About.\" In 2001, he starred alongside Robert De Niro in 15 Minutes and with Whoopi Goldberg in Kingdom Come. McCrary returned with his Family Matters co-star Kellie Shanygne Williams as Jamal on UPN's Eve for two episodes in April and May 2006. He provided the voice of Jazz in the 2007 film Transformers. He played Tarix in Bionicle: The Legend Reborn in 2009. McCrary has also been in films such as Next Day Air and Saw VI and national theater plays such as The Maintenance Man.\n\nHe joined the cast of CBS's daytime program The Young and the Restless in December 2009. Malcolm Winters was played by McCrary, who took over the role of Shemar Moore. McCrary left The Young and the Restless in October 2011, joined by his former Family Matters co-star Bryton James (né McClure). In 2011, McCrary's debut album was released. McCrary appeared in an episode of CBS's I Get That a Lot on January 6, 2010. Paris Hilton pretended to be a gas station clerk when he was pumping gas. She recognized him and requested an autograph from him. He assumed it was her, and when she confessed, he stated he thought she was doing community service. Darius also acted in Andrionna L. Williams' smash theatrical drama In-Laws From Hell, which she wrote, directed, and produced.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nDarius McCrary has been married three times and divorced each time. Juliette Merrill Vann, Karrine Steffans, and Tammy Brawner are his ex-wives. He and Brawner had a child together.\n\nIn an interview, one of his former wives said that he is physically abusive. She also stated that he once slapped her and choked her.\n\nShe has a son with her former boyfriend. Her marriage with Darius, who was officially her first husband, did not last for more than a year. Their union was turbulent. Darius's violent behavior towards her forced her to end her matrimony with him. She also filed for a permanent restraining order for Darius, as she feared he would harm her again. She has also turned into an author. Darius tried to choke Karrine to death in front of everyone in Los Angles. She says the crowd looked in horror to witness such a cruel and violent act. Darius is described to be volatile. She could be a superwoman on screen, but her spouse did not allow her to be a great counterpart. Their wedding affair did not last. Though they were married in 2009, soon, their differences started cropping up, leading to regular abuse as if it was a routine. An onscreen persona is always different from off-screen life. Their union ended very sourly. Darius's net worth is $16 million.\n\nMcCrary is the founder of FathersCare, a non-profit dedicated to offering information, education, and practical aid to fathers and legal networks to strengthen their relationships with their children. FathersCare is a non-profit organization founded by his father, aunts, and uncles, The McCrary's, under the McCrary Foundation umbrella.\n\nIn 2015, he was sentenced to prison for failing to pay child support."
