        "text": "Pass the Light (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nSteve is tired of the divisive nature of politics, especially since a local election is heating up as a representative is trying to use the Christian faith to divide group of people from each other. Thus, Steve decides that it’s time to do something at school, in the community, in the political world, and at home. To do this, Steve launches a massive campaign to remind everybody of what the Christian faith is really about.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nIt’s clear that the creators of this film focused on professional production quality. This fact is evident in the video quality and camera work. Sets, locations, and props are well-constructed and well-utilized. The only drawbacks include uneven audio quality and inconsistent editing. Nonetheless, this section deserves an above-average score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThe writers had several good ideas and agendas in creating this screenplay. They raised excellent points about legalism in Christina culture, but the writers bit off way more than they could chew by trying to cover too many concepts at once. As such, there are many random subplots that generate too many characters for the audience to keep up with. Sometimes, it’s hard for the viewer to keep up with the stream-of-consciousness storytelling style, and time is filled with lots of empty montages that could have been replaced with real character development. As they are, the characters are a mixed bag. The protagonist is basically perfect and able to fix everything. The antagonists are a bit extreme, and a majority of the characters are difficult to connect with due to the crowding-out nature of the narrative. For the most part, the political premise is quite unrealistic although the politician characters are okay. In the end, an overwhelming amount of issues are easily fixed in magical fashions, which stunts the potential of this plot. Nonetheless, there were plenty of good discussions about the problems in modern Christianity, which warrants a small score.\n\nActing Quality (2.5 points)\n\nFor the most part, the acting in Pass the Light is professional. Most cast members put forth commendable efforts, including good line delivery and emotions. However, there are a few small moments of some actors and actresses trying too hard and generally putting forth over-the-top performances. Nonetheless, it’s not enough to prevent a high rating in this section.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s evident to many that there are problems within established American Christianity. However, taking all of the issues on in one movie is not the right way to get your message across. Additionally, crafting an unrelatable protagonist will alienate most audiences. In the end, Pass the Light was based on a number of good ideas that crowded each other out and didn’t really help solve any of the concerns that the writers raised.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCross Purposes (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen an overconfident man who wants to be a medical student at a prestigious school is forced to complete an internship that he doesn’t care about, he has no idea what’s in for him. He’s determined to not care about any of the patients, but he can’t help but grow close to a teenager with a terminal brain tumor. Before he knows it, the intern is trying to determine the meaning of life although he didn’t used to care.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nCross Purposes offers an acceptable production with very few errors. Some of these pitfalls include some slight audio and editing concerns. For instance, there are a few distracting background noises, and certain scenes drag on too long. Nonetheless, this production team did good with what limited funds that they had. Video quality, camera work, and lighting are all above average. Sets, locations, and props are well-utilized. Thus, will very few problems to highlight, this section receives a high score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThe writers of this film, for the most part, were committed to crafting believable characters. However, because there are so few characters, they needed more deepening than they were given. It was good that the creators focused on the main idea of the screenplay without getting sidetracked, but doing such requires intense storytelling. Dialogue and conversations needed to be more than average to pull off this feat. As things are, the character arcs are a bit too steep, and the motivations and personalities of the characters are undeveloped. Elsewhere, it’s clear that the writers did some medical research, but some aspects of the narrative are slightly unrealistic. In the end, Cross Purposes has good messaging without being too forceful, and many audiences will enjoy this brief plot, so a meager score is warranted here.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nIt’s clear that the creative team behind this movie were definitely trying to make an effort, and this fact is evident in the acting. As a whole, the acting is either standard or a little bit better. Line delivery and emotional delivery are mostly on-point. Although some performances fall a bit short due to some forceful moments, there’s enough positive in this section to award an above-average score.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe team who produced this film, like many newer creators, has lots of potential for the future. Offerings like Cross Purposes, among others, provide hope for the future of Christian entertainment. Now, if those who make good things on small scales would collaborate with each other, pooling their expertise and resources, we would really have something to behold.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nChurch People [2021] (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nYouth pastor Guy Sides feels like he’s stuck inside of a well-oiled ministry machine. His boss, lead pastor Skip Finney, wants to find new and outlandish ways to draw people into the church. However, Guy feels like the simple gospel is enough. Nonetheless, Skip charges ahead with zany plans for an Easter production that will have everyone talking about it. Can Guy help everyone see the true meaning of Easter before it’s too late?\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nIt’s evident from start to finish that Church People is well-funded, and this results in a professional production. This high quality is evidenced by top-notch video, camera, and audio elements. The sets, locations, and props are great, and it’s clear that the money has been well-spent. The only minor concerns in this section pertain to some inconsistency in editing, but overall, a high score is warranted here.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThis plot begins with a strong opening sequence that refrains from narration and establishes a basis for subtle humor that avoids being too over-the-top. Though the comedy is sometimes a bit dry, the writers were definitely trying to construct effective dialogue as they took a realistic look at the problems with the corporate church mentality. There are many relatable conversations throughout the narrative although there’s also a dose of exposition throughout the course of the conversing. However, as the story continues to develop, some comedy overstays its welcome, being used too much and coming off as too quirky. Rather than expanding as it goes, the premise remains quite thin and has little basis in reality beyond silly conventions. Montages strung together with humor take the place of deeper character development, and some oddly explained off-screen scenes only make matters more awkward. When it comes down to it, Church People is just another return-to-hometown plot, complete with forced romance-with-your-former-love tropes. Despite its promising beginning, this narrative continues its nose dive all the way to a forced conclusion that involves an eye-rolling ‘twist’ that doesn’t really work. Thus, one point is garnered here.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nAlthough Stephen Baldwin once again positioned himself to star as a wise character in a self-produced film, he exhibits an acceptable kind of unusual in Church People. Other cast members are quite good in their performances despite a few slightly awkward moments. Some actors and actresses can be over-the-top and over-extended, but for the most part, they are all well-coached. As a whole, this section is at least above-average.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, some audiences will enjoy this screenplay even though it travels through well-worn church comedy ruts. Unfortunately, the humor just isn’t enough to carry the entire movie: deeper characters are needed to drive the point home. The purpose of Church People is commendable (exposing corporate Christianity), but the audience isn’t left with much beyond the obvious fact that this approach to the faith is insufficient. Therefore, this film boils down to another standard comedy release that will unfortunately be forgotten in a few months.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOur Rose Garden (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nA married couple is struggling due to the wife’s psychosis, which makes their lives unpredictable. However, despite his son’s desire to place his mother in a mental health facility, the husband wants to remain faithful to his wife because she was there for him when he was unfaithful to her.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nBecause this production stays within its financial and logistical boundaries, it is very professional. Video quality, camera work, and audio quality are all on point, and the soundtrack is quite good. Sets, locations, and props are all well-utilized. The only slight concerns relate to some choppy editing and awkward transitions, but these aren’t enough to prevent his section from receiving a high score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nOur Rose Garden uses a very creative story presentation that mixes past and present subplots to develop character motive. It’s an authentic look at realistic problems that many people face even if the dialogue is a little thin and under-developed. It was better to make a short film rather than long and drawn out movie with no meaning, but this didn’t leave much time to completely develop the characters to their fullest potentials. Also, the narrative could have had a stronger premise rather than a vague one as well as more concrete messaging. Throughout the screenplay, some scenes oddly mix with each other and cut off as another invades, which confuses the audience. The story concludes with a somewhat abrupt ending that seems to easily fix the problems at hand. Nonetheless, there was a enough potential in this plot to justify a meager rating.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThe cast of Our Rose Garden definitely showed that they were trying hard in their performances as they acted in meaningful ways. Despite some very small moments of robotic emotions and line delivery, these cast members demonstrated good skills. Another drawback of this section was beyond their control: the fact that the past and present cast members didn’t really look like each other. However, as a whole, this area was above average, which rounds out a good effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis creative team obviously has tons of potential for the future due their knack for analyzing people without creating stereotypes or being too heavy-handed with message-pushing. They also avoid wasting resources on an unnecessarily long film. With a little more character and narrative depth, as well as slight acting upgrades, these creators will be well on their way to greater things.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSmall Group [2020] (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nR. Scott Cooper is a struggling documentary film maker, but he gets a big break when an investor pays him to move his family to Georgia and go undercover as a local church member. While in disguise, Scott is supposed to record everything he sees using a special pair of glasses. However, halfway through the assignment, Scott and his wife begin to change their minds about the scheme as things in the small group aren’t what they thought. Will they have the courage to do what’s right before it’s too late?\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nAs a 2020 production, Small Group‘s is nearly flawless. Video quality, audio quality, and camera work are all on point. The sets, locations, and props are well-funded and well-utilized. There are no lighting problems, and the soundtrack is acceptable. The only thing keeping this section from being perfect is the poor editing, but this is likely a byproduct of a bloated plot. Hence, this section receives a high score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (.5 point)\n\nDespite a somewhat forced premise, this narrative has a surprising amount of potential, starting with the mostly realistic portrayals of people in churches. Some comedic scenes are actually funny due to pretty good dialogue, and the writers raise a lot of legitimate points about institutionalized churches. Nonetheless, the storylines struggles with being more than just a collection of funny sequences that are strung together without specific focus. The ‘villain’ is a total strawman, and certain things happen because the plot requires them to, causing the characters to be swept away in the circumstances and hitting on all the expected points. Although there are too many characters and subplots to adequately focus on in one film, some scenes occur for no reason at all except to fill time. Trying to do everything at once causes the narrative to leave behind a lot of unfinished ideas; it feels more like a series than a movie as some elements come completely out of left field and don’t fit with the overall purpose (if there is one). The sheer amount of content in this story is overwhelming for the audience, and some humor is just ridiculously obnoxious. However, though the ending sequence is rushed and tends to magically fix its problems via unrealistic coincidences, the conclusion is better than the beginning if you make it there. Therefore, this sliver of potential, in addition to pretty good characters, keeps this section from being zero.\n\nActing Quality (2.5 points)\n\nMuch like its production, Small Group‘s acting is actually quite good. Though some cast members tend to have overdone lines and emotions, all performances get better as they go. As a whole, this section exhibits a lot of professionalism and rounds out a big mixed bag.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis screenplay’s central problem is that it can’t decide if it’s about hidden problems within the American church, quirks of American churchgoers, ministries and corruption in Central America, and people doing silly stuff together. Surprisingly, despite the jumbled plot, there’s actually hope for Small Group…in series form. There’s simply too much going on here to make a less-than-two-hour film. Had a series been made instead of a movie, this idea would have had more room to authentically develop. As it is, based on its heavy marketing push, Small Group unfortunately feels like another Christian entertainment cash grab.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n12 Days With God (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen Devin Sherman undergoes surgery for cancer around his eye, he’s given a chance to reflect on all he’s recently done. This includes his mistakes and failures, which he still regrets yet cannot make up for. During the procedure and recovery, he looks back on where he’s been and where he is now. These reflections will determine what the future trajectory of his life will be.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nOn the whole, the production of 12 Days With God is above average as it contains good video quality and an acceptable soundtrack, despite the fact that there are some noticeable background sounds and obvious overdubs. Though lighting can be inconsistent, the sets, locations, and props are professional. Also, some of the problem areas get better as the movie progresses, and the editing is at least above the halfway mark. Thus, this section earns a good enough score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nWhile it’s a little boring at first, the concept behind 12 Days With God is interesting and intriguing. Although there is unnecessary narration throughout, the effective use of psychological elements and flashbacks create a non-linear plot style and establish strong character motives. Despite the somewhat slow pace, the interconnections of characters is good, even if the meandering storyline can be a bit hard to follow sometimes. Also, character arcs come off as too steep at times, and the narrative’s timeline is difficult to comprehend in some instances as the presentation is often muted and confusing. Elsewhere, many of the comedy asides seem out of place and unnecessary, and there are annoying title cards between the days that transpire during the plot. Further, some scenes are fairly wasted as they’re not used like they could have been. Nonetheless, the epilogue stands out though the lead-up isn’t that great, which blunts the otherwise good message’s full impact. In the end, this section does enough to earn an average score but still could have been better.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nWhile there are some situations of robotic line delivery, emotions are mostly okay despite some circumstances of over-acting. Many of the cast members come off as overly practiced while some are better than others. The good thing is that the acting overall improves as the movie goes on, which raised this section’s rating higher than it would have been.\n\nConclusion\n\nSince the creative team behind 12 Days With God is committed to using real stories in their films, they already have great potential for the future. Once they’re able to work out the pesky concerns with production and acting, like many new film makers, they need to dedicate resources to people who know how to effectively write screenplays. This is perhaps the most pervasive issue of modern Christian entertainment, but once it’s rectified, the field will look completely different.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhy We Breathe (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nCarrie Hicks just wants to catch a country music break in Nashville, but her relationship with her current boyfriend consistently complicates things. However, things escalate when he inadvertently paralyzes Carrie’s daughter, leading the aspiring artist to flee town and seek shelter with her great uncle, who she’s barely spoken to in years. Carrie wants to get back on her feet and move on with her life, but her daughter’s new disability often halts her in her tracks. In the end, Carrie will have to not only come to grips with her new reality but with the faith she’s been running from all these years.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nDespite a limited budget, it’s obvious that great care was taken to maintain mostly good production quality in Why We Breathe. This is evidenced by acceptable video and audio elements. Though there are some random moments of shaky camera work and some obvious overdubs, there is enough positive in the film’s first half to keep this section above the average line. Sets, locations, and props are well-constructed and well-utilized throughout the movie. Unfortunately, however, the editing tends to become more choppy as things progress, which prevents this area of the movie from being all that it could be. Nonetheless, this is acceptable for a first-time effort.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nIn the beginning of the narrative, the ideas are creatively presented without the use of narration and through the eyes of believable characters with realistic struggles. In the plot’s first half, the dialogue is authentic, and the use of subtlety is commendable. However, by the film’s middle point, things tend to become more abrupt as some montages waste valuable time while a handful of conversations reference off-screen content that would have been better to see. Not a few scenes feel like they’re unfinished or cut off as the storyline unnecessarily rushes to an inevitable conclusion that is fairly cheesy. Unfortunately, in this pursuit, the previously positive elements lose their value as the story’s progression becomes more and more rapid. In the end, since the movie’s premise was mostly typical with some predictable elements, it needed deep character development and a more natural conclusion instead of ending with unrealistic fixes and unfinished ideas. The effort is notable, but more fleshing out was needed before it went into production.\n\nActing Quality (2.5 points)\n\nAs a whole, the acting in Why We Breathe is mostly professional. Line delivery and emotions appear natural as the cast members seem comfortable in their roles. Though there are some slight moments of robotic and awkward performances, for the most part, the actors and actresses are definitely working to be earnest. Thus, this rounds out an above-average attempt that could develop into better things in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe creative team behind this film definitely had a lot going for them, and they began very strong. However, somewhere at the halfway point, it seems like the process became rushed in a possible desire to quickly release the movie. It’s a shame because with a little more collaboration and a slight amount of fleshing out, Why We Breathe could have scored much higher. Even so, it’s highly possible that the lessons learned from this project could lead to better things in the coming days.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSweet Inspirations (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen four women who feel like they aren’t making a difference through the church events they attend are inspired to somehow help a struggling women’s shelter, they begin an unanticipated journey that takes them to the unlikeliest of places. Their church has recently acquired a dilapidated restaurant, so the four friends take it upon themselves to renovate the establishment in order to use it to raise money for the domestic violence ministry that’s in financial straits. However, things don’t go as they planned, and they must each learn unique lessons about trusting God and not living in their own strength.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nAlthough there are some random moments of inadequate production in Sweet Inspirations, such as some instances of shaky camera work and some inconsistent lighting in certain scenes, the movie’s production quality does overall improve as the film progresses. The sets, locations, and props are mostly well-constructed throughout, and the video and audio qualities are up to industry standards. While the soundtrack is a bit generic and the editing sometimes uneven, this is a passable production albeit one that could have gone a bit further than it did.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nSweet Inspirations tries to do a lot in a limited amount of time, and it’s not all bad. It tries to present an interestingly complex storyline about relevant, real-life topics, but the many characters who are used to pull this off tend to crowd each other out and make the narrative go in many different directions at once. Some characters are downright unnecessary while others have relatable personalities and characteristics; the same critiques can be applied to the conversations among the characters as some of them are really meaningful and worthwhile while others are completely pointless and fruitless. Similarly, there are some great messages to embrace in Sweet Inspirations, such as no longer wasting time on useless church activities, waiting on God, not trying to do everything in your own strength, and doing too much ministry work to the point of exhaustion, but some of these are pushed too hard on the audience, and at times, they are undermined by illogical coincidences and unjustifiable character actions that seem condoned by the writers. In the end, the high number of romantic subplots, the desire to cover too many things in one story, and the generally wasted scenes overshadow the otherwise interesting and realistic ending that could have capped off a very good effort. There was a lot going for this movie, but there may have been too many proverbial cooks in the kitchen and not enough trimming before the project moved forward.\n\nActing Quality (2.5 points)\n\nFor the most part, the acting of Sweet Inspirations is its strongest point as many of the cast members are comfortable in their roles and realistic in their performances. Though there are some who are trying a bit too hard, they are not as prominent as the better actors and actresses. Also, the emotions are a mixed bag but are overall acceptable. Thus, this rounds out a slightly above-average effort that could have been a bit better.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, Sweet Inspirations would have benefited from taking its own advice that it gave to one of its main characters about not trying to do everything “good” at once and not attempting to accomplish things in their own strength. It’s clear the creators had a lot of intriguing ideas along with meaningful messages, but trying to include all of them alongside too much pedestrian content was this movie’s ultimate downfall. Nonetheless, there is enough positive here to keep many viewers interested, and some audiences will find it to be worth their while.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLaughing at the Moon (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nNatalie McClay is a selfish businesswoman who wants what she wants when she wants it. However, when her high-dollar lifestyle demands that she get a roommate to share her rent, she has no idea what to expect. When Iris walks into her apartment, Natalie’s whole world is turned upside down. Natalie tries to do everything she can to discredit the eccentric new optimist in her life, the harder she tries, the more her friends like Iris. However, when Natalie goes too far with her mistreatment of her quirky roommate, there are far-reaching consequences, more than Natalie could have imagined.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nIt’s clear that Laughing at the Moon had an adequate budget since the production is quite good, including great video quality and professional camera work with an artistic touch. Similarly, the audio quality and soundtrack are fine, and sets, locations, and props are well-used and well-constructed. At times, the editing is passable, but other times, it’s a bit choppy as some scenes cut off without warning, which suggests that there was a lot more content than they had space for. Also, there are some slight continuity errors between some scene, which seems like an unforced error. However, in the end, this is an above-average production that lays a good foundation for the future.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nLaughing at the Moon makes some good attempts at comedy that’s actually funny at times, but sometimes, it’s awkwardly forced, and there tends to be a bit too much quirkiness in some scenes. One of the best thing about this plot is its focus on the human tendency to convince oneself of one’s own superiority over others, especially those who do not fit into societal molds, and this is definitely a story that needs to be told, even if this version is a little (purposely) offbeat at times. The characters are pretty good, but they are hampered by mentions of off-screen content, which lends further credence to the possibility of a quick editing job that chopped out important scenes due to too much original content. Even still, the use of flashbacks throughout the narrative is very effective to establish one of the main characters’ traumatic memories, yet sometimes, it feels like a lot of the scenes are randomly strung together and loosely connected with musical montages that tend to waste time. However, the dialogue in the middle of the plot is pretty good at establishing some believable characters, and there are some very timely themes explored, such as being fake vs being authentic. None of the characters are perfect and each has their own unique flaws. One other weakness of the storyline is the somewhat steep character arcs that occur due to the slightly rushed ending, but there’s a very good point at the end that is worth watching. In the end, Laughing at the Moon is a mixed bag that is pretty good in and of itself; it also shows great potential for future projects.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nFor the most part, the cast members of Laughing at the Moon naturally and easily assume their respective roles. While emotions can be a bit overstated at times, they are mostly fine, and line delivery as a whole is on point. As a side note, this is one of Erin Bethea’s best roles to date. In summary, this is an above-average acting job that rounds out an above-average film.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis movie boasts a very good idea that’s presented in a fresh way, and the main thing holding it back from the Hall of Fame is its choppy presentation. Thus, Laughing at the Moon deserves some level of remake whether it be a new film about similar concepts or a series format for the original film because this creative team may be better at making Christian series. Either way, it should be interesting to see what this team produces next.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCrave: The Fast Life (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nFor years, Max has resented his father for leaving them. Now, this anger boils beneath the surface as he endeavors to make a big name for himself as a club promoter in the LA night club scene. However, when he’s faced with a lucrative offer he can’t refuse, little does he know that he’s sinking deeper into pride and arrogance. He refuses to turn to God as things seem to be falling apart around him, but a series of events begins to change his heart and remind him of his mother’s faith.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nSince it is a 2018 production, Crave: The Fast Life should have exhibited a bit more of a dynamic nature. As it is, the video quality is grainy at times, even though the camera work is mostly fine. At times, there is odd lighting throughout, but all production elements do get better as they go. Subtle camera angles throughout reveal well-placed recurring props, and settings are overall realistic and authentic. The soundtrack is also effectively integrated throughout, and the editing is mostly average. In the end, the production does enough in the second half to achieve and above-average score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nFrom the get-go, it seems like the screenwriters have a fairly interesting story to share in Crave, which is evidenced by an effective beginning that contains a key character flashback. Other flashbacks are also well-done throughout the course of the plot, yet this technique isn’t used to its fullest potential as the storyline tends to jump around in time using only time stamps to keep the audience oriented. This method of storytelling isn’t the best, even though there are some good attempts to gradually develop character personality and motive. Even so, the time jumps can be a bit disorienting at times, and while the avoidance of narration is commendable, it’s still somewhat confusing for character continuity. Sometimes, dialogue tends to be a bit forward and forced, and the Christian message-pushing seems off-base as it’s portrayed as primarily a church-going habit combined with some behavior modification. There’s some sermonizing done by ‘perfect’ Christian characters who seem to assume that giving people verses without getting to know them is sufficient for a life change. However, one of the plot’s central themes is a hard, realistic look at how generational patterns repeat, which is good, but it tends to wade into some too realistic and slightly edgy content at times. The middle of the story lags and loses some focus and creativity as dynamic storytelling is exchanged for Christian platitudes and quick fixes. The character arcs in the last third of the film are too steep to be believed, and it all culminates in a very quick and rushed ending that easily fixes things with little to no consequences. In the end, there was a lot of potential here, so hopefully, next time, this creative team will be able to work out the kinks of their otherwise good storytelling.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nOn the whole, the acting in Crave is mostly average. It starts out a bit slow but improves with time like other elements of the film do. Some scenes can feel a bit awkward and have a one-take tone to them while others come off as quickly filmed. Moreover, emotional scenes can seem forced at times, but in the big picture, there is enough good here to outweigh the inexperience. The cast members appear to mean well and want to do their best, so this is a good way to approach things. In the end, this film has some positive marks, and it’s a good start for this creative team.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere’s no doubt that Christian entertainment creators are trying to expand the horizons of the genre with films like Crave that would have never been considered just under a decade ago. This progress is encouraging, so we hope to see more forward motion in this area. However, as creativity grows, we also need to see production, acting, and plot qualities grow with it, especially storyline and character growth. We’re just now getting to the point where Christian entertainment is depicting ‘flawed’ characters in the world outside the church, so now, as Christians, we need to get better at telling captivating stories that will truly reach people for Christ.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nUntil the Mountains Fall by Connilyn Cossette\n\nAuthor’s Note: We were provided with a free copy of this novel in exchange for a fair and honest review.\n\nPlot & Storyline Quality (2 points)\n\nConnilyn Cossette’s third installment in the Cities of Refuge series is a mixed bag that shows both potential and room for improvement. Continuing where the last novel left off, this one starts a new plot with more members of Moriyah’s extensive family. Rivkah is a young widow who feels that her father is forcing her to marry her late husband’s younger brother. She feels that her time with Gidal was too short, and her time with his brother Malakhi will be much too long. Rivkah can’t see any way out of the situation, so she goes ahead with the betrothal ceremony, however, during and after the same she does everything she can to discourage Malakhi from marrying her. Malakhi has loved Rivkah since they were children, and doesn’t understand her cold attitude towards him. From his perspective, his continual needling and teasing on Rivkah as a child was to help keep her spirit alive after her mother’s death. However, from Rivkah’s perspective, he has always been a silly boy who can’t take life seriously. Rivkah sees her way out when her friend Nessa announces her plans to escape her own impending arranged marriage to a less than desirable mate by looking for job opportunities at the festival in Laish. The two depart as planned, but the two women soon find themselves in difficult situations that lead to hard decisions. Overall, the plotline continues in a mostly predictable fashion, and unlike the previous novel, this is just a romance. There is no mystery or intrigue to speak of here. The storyline in this novel is not as good as its predecessor, and leaves room to be desired in creativity. While some good ideas are displayed, and at times implemented, the reader is left wanting depth. It was a semi-interesting idea to use a levirate marriage as the basis for a storyline, however, at times this part of the plot feels like a book of Ruth redux. Furthermore, the plot feels a bit rushed – there is a five-year time jump halfway through the book – and the romance a bit forced at times. Cossette has shown us that she has more potential than this, so she earns an average score in this section.\n\nCharacter Development (3 points)\n\nIn comparison, Cossette’s characters remain her strongest point. Even though the plot leaves room to be desired, the main characters are quite good. Rivkah is the best character because she makes realistic choices and displays many relatable though processes throughout the story. It is also important to note that Rivkah’s character is based off of real events from Cossette’s life. This gives the protagonist depth and believability. Malakhi is a good character because he has a defined personality and consistent tendencies, however, he seems unfinished in the end. In contrast, Cossette does a good job of contrasting how scenarios are viewed differently by various people throughout the novel. On the whole, Cossette’s female leads are always good, but her male leads always feel unfinished. For instance, Eitan has more depth as a minor character than he did as a protagonist. Furthermore, the other minor characters are a mix of good, average, and unnecessary, so a little more editing was necessary here. These strengths and weaknesses level out to an above average score for Cossette in this section.\n\nCreativity & Originality (.5 point)\n\nFinally, Cossette earns a half a point in originality for her good characters. However, there is, unfortunately, not much creativity to speak of here. Most of the storyline feels like it was made with the purpose of writing an epilogue for old characters – I believe Cossette has more to offer than this. This flaw may exist because of contract constraints. Therefore, I still believe that the Cities of Refuge series has potential to be a good Christian series. The screenwriter would need to downgrade Rivkah and Malakhi to minor characters, and use characters from previous novels as protagonists, but it can be done. Additionally, he/she would need to use the potential in the city of refuge foundation to craft a story that contains more than romance.\n\nWish List Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Pilgrim’s Progress: The Journey Begins\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe famous tale by John Bunyan now comes to life in animated form for the first time. Join Christian as he embarks on a daring quest to the Celestial City that will ultimately test his faith and endurance as he fights through each new challenge the enemy brings him in attempt to dissuade him from the path of righteousness.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nThe overall production of this movie is unique and fairly well done – minus a few imperfections. One main imperfection is that most scenes are overall quite choppy and transitions are awkward. Not to mention that some scenes (especially close up staring scenes) go on for a little too long. For the most part though, as already mentioned, the animation quality is actually quite good, especially scenes involving nature. As for music quality, it’s not bad but it seems a little inconsistent. For example, it’s either too overpowering or too drowned out by extra background noises. However, these are all fairly minor issues because there is always room for improvement in nearly every film. This being said, Pilgrims Progress The Journey Begins certainly has a lot more to offer (production wise) than most Christian animated movies with just a few things that could be improved upon in a production sense.\n\nPlot & Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nThe film started out with a creative outlook on the town where the main character resides, which made one think that they were going to modify the plot in a more creative/modern way. However, they sort of overlooked this idea and continued with an edited version of the original storyline. This being said, even though they did cut out a lot of the story (obviously for the sake of time) it still seems like they tried to cram too much in a film with a medium-length run-time. This goes back to the choppy production work – not to say that the plot and storyline quality is not good, it just would have been more interesting if they had restructured the plot a little bit more. The writers didn’t need too completely change the original plot, but create a few different outlooks on things like they did with some scenes already. For example, the beginning, as mentioned, and one other very interesting outlook on the story was the Legality hill scene. This scene in particular was probably the most creative scene in the movie. Another main imperfection in the storyline was that each scene seemed very different from each other, as if they were all written at different times or by different people. These factors cause the storyline to not flow very well. All of these issues and positive qualities are why it receives said points.\n\nActing Quality (1.5 points)\n\nThe acting quality in this movie is somewhat mediocre at best. The beginning of the film is especially rough in this area. The mayor/superior’s assistant is quite cringe worthy, even during his very short appearance in the film. The acting seems to get slightly better as the movie progresses, and it is also quite apparent throughout the film that most of the characters are played by the same voice actors (meaning John Rhys-Davies in particular). This is not really a problem though because it does workout in the end considering John Rhys-Davies is good at what he does and this method will always save space on the budget. The one main drawback of the casting is that the main character (Christian) is a bit annoying at times – it is mostly tolerable but could be better. Overall, the acting quality is one of the the main drawbacks to the film. We should certainly like to see these filmmakers spend more time on this aspect in future films.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, all said menial problems noted about this film don’t really matter that much in the end as long as the main point is established and that point is the gospel message. Although a higher production, acting and storyline quality would definitely help to get this point along more effectively, as long as it reaches individuals and families for Christ that is all that matters. This being said, Pilgrims Progress: The Journey Begins is a great movie for children and families to watch because it doesn’t treat children like they are dumb – like so many animated christian films do – and doesn’t completely lose the interest of adults.\n\nfinal rating 5.5 points out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n40: The Temptation of Christ (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter Jesus’ baptism and before his earthly ministry officially began, he went into the desert for forty days, where He was tempted by the devil to forfeit His work before it even began. Satan used many tactics to convince Jesus to fall, yet Christ remained without sin in the trials. As Jesus endured the hardship, He experienced human pain and suffering that prepared Him to relate to those who needed His power the most.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nWhile this film’s budget was somewhat limited due to its independent nature, resources were clearly allocated responsibly. Although there are some cheap special effects and sound effects, mostly toward the beginning of the film, there is plenty of positive to note here. The first thirty minutes of the movie are the hardest because these contain some poor editing and lagging scenes, but once the film progresses past this point, things begin to look up. There are some elements of shaky camera work throughout, but the outdoor locations used are very engaging and professionally shot. The perspective filming is effective, and the soundtrack is highly engaging in many parts as it adds to the viewing experience. Further, video quality is crisp throughout, and even though it takes a bit, the production slowly becomes a great one, which is a testament to what this team could pull off with more resources under their belt.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (2 points)\n\nLike the production, the plot is a bit shaky at first, mostly due to immediate and unnecessary narration. Jesus is also a bit too theatrical and inaccessible as a character at first, but He definitely gets better as the story goes on. It’s somewhat difficult to get through the first thirty minutes of the film because of these issues and because of some lagging scenes, so it’s possible that this idea may have worked better as a short film. However, once the thirty-minute mark has been passed, things change for the better since a really good idea is revealed. The use of flashbacks and flash-forwards is very effective to bridge time and to reinforce the psychological elements that the temptations are based on, which are very well-constructed. The core of the plot is based on a collection of very engaging and creative conversations that clearly show what the film was made for. Old Testament prophecies are integrated very well into the dialogue, which is something we don’t see enough of in Bible films. As a whole, this creative team’s take on the temptations of Jesus is very interesting and innovative, mostly due to well-executed psychological sequences that go hand-in-hand extremely well with the flashbacks, mostly because the viewer doesn’t always see the temptation coming. In the end, the use of symbolism and artistic elements are effective in presenting a familiar Bible story in a new, creative way, and the horror elements are handled well without being too sensational. Thus, there is a lot of potential for this creative team through future collaborations.\n\nActing Quality (1.5 points)\n\nWhile the cast is not entirely culturally authentic, this can be forgiven due to the limited budget of the project. At first, the line delivery and emotions come off as too forced and theatrical, but they moderate as the film progresses and show concerted improvement. Due the small cast, they carry the whole film on their shoulders, and for the most part, they post good performances by the movie’s conclusion. This rounds out an overall refreshing independent effort, which plants promising seeds for the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s difficult to portray the temptations of Jesus properly without a good understanding of human psychology. As a whole, this creative team appears to have such an understanding. The Temptation of Christ is everything a first-time, self-funded project should be: as good of a production as possible, a well-written plot that demonstrates talent that can be developed in the future, and a good enough acting performance to carry the day. Thus, we can’t wait to see what these film makers have to offer once they are given better funding opportunities.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nInheritance [2018] (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe Delvecchios have always been a tight-knit family centered around their restaurant business, but now things are changing as their patriarch is stepping away from the leadership role he’s held for so long due to his failing health. As he hands the reins over to his sons, old wounds are re-opened as past sins and grudges are exposed once again. When the unexpected happens, will they be able to put things back together the way they once were?\n\nProduction Quality (1.5 points)\n\nInheritance is overall a surprising movie albeit a frustrating one due to its conflicting elements. One of these conflicts involves the production, which is seemingly unnecessarily low-quality. This is evidenced by some inconsistent lighting and some weird aspect ratios, which both seem unnecessary. While camera work is mostly fine, video is sometimes low quality. However, on the bright side, the audio quality is good, including an effective soundtrack. Moreover, the editing is slightly choppy at times due to a large amount of content being handled. Overall, this is a mostly average production that has elements holding it back that seem very avoidable. Had these issues been taken care of, we could be looking at a entirely different film.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (2 points)\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Inheritance is that it presents a very good study on family systems and generational patterns, which causes the characters to be almost good enough to sustain an entire miniseries. This makes this film a rare case in which character and plot development actually outshine other elements of the movie. However, there are still some issues here, such as a choppy plot presentation that is evidenced by scenes that randomly cut off with no warning at times. There are also times when subplots end very abruptly without any real resolution or understanding of why it happened the way that it did. Even still, there are some great attempts at ambiguity and the portrayal of imperfect, face-value characters without any major agendas to push. The dialogue is somewhat inconsistent, however, as it is sometimes quite good while too expository and shortcut-creating at other times. It’s almost like too much content was written in the initial creation of the film, which required cutting, which happened in some inconvenient places. This possible cutting also caused some unnecessarily steep character arcs that lead up to an almost too-perfect ending. Even so, there’s a ton of potential here that could be used in future projects.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nFor the most part, Inheritance contains a mostly professional cast of experienced cast members, such as Robert Miano and Andrew Cheney, even though Cheney’s fake accent can get a little annoying at times. This is easily one of Miano’s best performances, but there are also some other fake accent issues to contend with. Even still, line delivery is mostly on-point, even if emotional delivery is slightly inconsistent and overplayed at times. In the end, every cast member is cast appropriately, which rounds out an above-average film that could have been better.\n\nConclusion\n\nInheritance does what every low-budget independent Christian film should strive to do: craft a meaningful plot that outshines it budget, which will cause the film to stand out in the sea of mediocrity and possibly open new doors for the future. It’s not perfect by any means, but it does stand out, and it makes us want to see what else could be done with these characters if more money was put towards the effort. It’s highly possible that a series or miniseries format would have been better for this idea. Regardless, we can’t wait to see what this creative team produces next.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMaggie’s Christmas Miracle (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nMaggie has always hated Christmas ever since her father left the family during the holiday season. Ever since then, she’s sought to control everything around her, especially her young son’s life. However, when his grades begin dropping, she is forced to entrust him to the care of an after-school tutor, but Maggie soon finds that she isn’t like what she expected from a tutor. Will she decide to open up her heart over the holiday season to love again?\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nAs expected, Maggie’s Christmas Miracle is a typically fine Hallmark production with good video quality and camera, as well as good audio quality. The soundtrack is predictably generic but not as bad as usual. The sets, locations, and props are fine, but the Christmas decor is expectedly overwhelming and beyond belief. Further, the editing is average, and thus, everything in this production is standard and expected from the Hallmark assembly line of Christmas films.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThough Hallmark movies are always better when using source material, especially from authors like Karen Kingsbury, there are still plenty of typical elements in Maggie’s Christmas Miracle. While Karen Kingsbury characters run circles around typical Hallmark fare, there are still a lot of cheesy feel-good elements throughout this plot. However, the dialogue is mostly good enough to develop character motive and personality, even if the plot is extremely predictable with a cookie-cutter romance plot where two people who don’t like each other at first are thrown together at Christmastime. The story includes all the expected turns and conventions, and all of the stereotypes are too easily fallen into. Since this is a character-based plot, we needed to see deeper character growth than this, and we also would have liked to see relationship twists and turns that were more based on past and present personality and behavior issues rather than on unrealistically stupid miscommunication problems (see The Bridge). Unfortunately, the story gets worse as it goes on as cheap Christian messages are awkwardly inserted and end up hurting any good portions of dialogue there may be. Essentially, the source material is helping this plot to be more than it would otherwise be, but there’s still a lot more that could have been accomplished here.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nAs expected, the casting and acting of this film is mostly professional with typical Hallmark elements, such as some overdone makeup. For the most part, the line delivery and the emotions are natural, but there are some portions that are a bit too sappy. However, as a whole, this cast is professional enough to know what they’re doing and to produce an above-average performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf Hallmark only used books and true stories as source material from here until eternity, the channel would be a much better place for it. However, this is highly unlikely to happen. Even still, there is enough good in Maggie’s Christmas Miracle to make it a passable holiday film to watch if you want a safe, benign movie that’s not too old and not too cheesy. Also, if you like Karen Kingsbury novels, this film is definitely for you.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMy Broken Horse Christmas (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nJohn always likes to go with his father to pick out a new horse every year, and he knows his father is good at picking out the best horses. However, this year, his father acquires a crazed unruly mare and decides that she belongs to John so that he can train her. John is dejected at this prospect because he feels like he’ll never be able to fix his new broken horse. Nevertheless, this father persists in forcing him to train it, which leads to surprising results.\n\nProduction Quality (3 points)\n\nJohn Lyde and his Covenant Communications and Mainstay Productions teams are consistently committed to quality productions even though their films are not traditional length. This commitment to good quality is evident in crisp video quality, professional camera work, and good audio quality. The soundtrack is interesting and engaging, and the sets, locations, and props are well-constructed and well-utilized for the historical time period. In the end, though the editing is a bit average, this production doesn’t have any major problems, which warrants a perfect score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (.5 point)\n\nLyde and his team always prize shorter stories over long and drawn out films that have no interest, and basing this short film off of a Christian novella was definitely a good idea to acquire source material. Because of this source material, the plot is slightly more creative and different than most Christmas films, but it seems to contain a lot of odd messaging that appears to glorify patriarchal attitudes. The father character is likely realistic in his portrayal, but the story seems to pass along messaging that he is a wise and all-knowing character. Other characters need better development through more substantial dialogue, which one would think would come from basing a short film off of a novella. Since it’s so short, we needed to see very streamlined character development, but the plot instead lags behind and chooses to focus on pushing lessons on the audience that really don’t make much sense and on forced Christian messages that don’t seem to apply to the characters’ situations. Some portions don’t appear to be very rooted in reality, and the abrupt and rushed ending causes the story to be over before much happens. In short, while this could have been an honest and raw character biopic, it was reduced to a quasi-sermonizing piece that pushes messages that are hard to comprehend.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nAs a whole, there aren’t many acting problems in this film, which is a consistent component in John Lyde’s creations. The casting and coaching appear to be professional, and for the most part, emotions and line delivery are natural. However, this section isn’t perfect before of some slightly\n\nover-dramatized parts and some weak child acting, but in the end, this rounds out an another above average film for the Mainstay\\Covenant team.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s absolutely a great idea to use Christian novels and novellas as source material for Christian films, especially since there are so many options to choose from. This high number of selection opportunities makes it odd when obscure novellas like this one was chosen, especially when it’s not clear what My Broken Horse Christmas actually wants us to learn. It’s a visually appealing yet substantially vague experience that will likely and unfortunately be easily forgotten. John Lyde has always been right on the cusp of greatness, so it’s time for him to take the next step into dynamic creations.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Identical (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nRyan Wade has always known the church life because he was raised by a pastor and his wife, whom he believed to be his real parents. However, as he grew older, he did not feel the call to ministry that his father was impressing upon him. Instead, he wanted to pursue a musical future. However, when he got caught by the authorities doing ‘wrong things,’ Ryan’s father sent him to the military to ‘get fixed,’ with the expectation that Ryan would enter seminary afterward. However, the military did not dampen Ryan’s musical dreams, and once he was out, he encountered a life-changing revelation: he is the twin brother of musical sensation Drexel Hemsley, which raises many questions about Ryan’s true heritage. Will the answers he wants give him peace or more turmoil?\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nIt’s clear that The Identical is a well-funded production with a well-allocated budget. Video quality, camera work, and audio quality are all what they should be. The original soundtrack is creative, even if there is some obvious lip-syncing. The production’s biggest strengths relate to the great\n\nattention to historical detail, which is evident in the well-constructed and well-utilized sets, locations, and props that reflect correct time period and culture. The only drawback to this production is the somewhat choppy editing that is a byproduct of the plot presentation, but on the whole, this is a very good and professional production.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThough this story concept is a bit off-the-wall as the twin brother characters bear a strangely similar resemblance to Elvis Presley (not really sure why this character concept was chosen), there are some interesting messages to explore in The Identical. For example, the story provides a realistic portrayal of historical issues of the time period, such as churches suppressing certain types of ideas, hiding issues, and expecting men to be fixed by the military. However, besides the somewhat out-of-left-field story concept, there is way too much narration and expository dialogue to fill time gaps, which obviously stunts character growth and short-circuits the dialogue potential. It would have been better to just let the story unfold naturally and to let the characters reach their full potential through meaningful dialogue that builds their personalities and motives. Besides this obvious misstep, the story is based on too many coincidences and things that happen because the plot demands it. However, despite these issues and despite the odd premise, there is lots of potential in this story–enough to warrant a remake–and many audiences will still find it to be a fine movie.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThe Identical has surprisingly professional casting and acting. Several cast members, such as Ray Liota, do a great job playing multiple ages. Some emotions tend to be overdone, however, especially from Erin Cottrell. However, line delivery is almost always on point, and the costuming is historically accurate and realistic. This rounds out a slightly above average movie effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s great for Christian films to come up with creative movie concepts that are outside of the norm and to make films that are good because they are good without being Christian-ized. The idea behind The Identical is one of those you don’t think of every day, so the creatively must be commended. However, while a lot of the attention this movie received centered around the central concept, there were other pitfalls that kept it from being all that it could be. Even still, there is plenty of positive here to build on, and there are some great cues for other films to model after. It will be interesting to see if this creative team does anything else in the future.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nForever My Girl (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nLiam and Josie were in love all throughout high school, and many felt like they were destined to be together forever. However, when they were on the verge of pledging their lives together forever, Liam experienced several life-changing moments. First, his mother died suddenly, and Liam was discovered as a country artist and became successful almost overnight. Thus, Liam left Josie behind without saying goodbye. Now, after several years of fame and success, Liam has gotten into trouble with his drinking habit and has been advised to lay low for a while. Thus, he returns to his hometown to live with his father, who is a pastor, and Liam is shocked at who he finds waiting for him there.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nAs a modern, standard inspirational film, Forever My Girl checks all of the right production boxes. Video quality, camera work, and audio quality are all what they should be. The soundtrack is a bit generic and uncreative, but the sets, props, and locations are all realistic, appropriate, and professional. The only other minor issue to point out here is the fact that the editing isn’t the best it could be, but as a whole, this is a very high quality production that we have come to see as commonplace in recent Christian films, and it’s a trend we definitely need to see continue.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThough it is based on a novel, Forever My Girl unfortunately follows a predictable and stereotypical storyline that has been done many times before. The return-to-hometown plot has many different iterations, and this one is just the star-returns-to-the-hometown version. However, the presentation of this predictability is not entirely annoying and does make some good attempts at being realistic, such as a good attempt to explore family systems and some general efforts to create believable characters and situations. Even so, the characters need to be a bit deeper through better dialogue, and the main character’s inevitable arc is a too steep. Nevertheless, the message of the movie is fine, and many audiences will find it to be a good movie. It’s definitely ten times better than your average Hallmark throwaway.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThough the lead actor and the lead actress seem confused and uncoached a lot of the time, the rest of the cast members make up for their deficiencies. It’s unclear whether or not their characters are meant to be written that way, but it seems like the lead cast members could have contributed a bit more than they did. However, the other members of the cast demonstrate great line delivery and realistic emotions, which is enough to bring this section over the average mark. As a whole, this movie is good enough to be watchable.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is definitely good idea to model movies after novels; if a film like this had not had a story written for it in a book, it likely would have been much worse. This is definitely a practice we need to see more of on the coming days. Hollywood has already figured out that using source material is the key to successful entertainment, so it’s time for Christian film makers to follow suit because if they put their minds to it, they can definitely do it better. There is plenty of Christian source material to use, so it’s a great chance to keep using it.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nUndeserved (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nDawn’s life is changed when her deadbeat mother is shot dead in a bar parking lot, which prompts the state to assign her custody to her aunt and uncle until she can finish high school. Despite her loss, things are looking up for her as she is moved to a better area. However, it doesn’t take long for Dawn to discover that there are just as many hidden problems in suburbia as there are obvious problems on the streets. Fearing for her safety, Dawn leaves her new home to take up residence on the streets once again. Moreover, she soon finds herself in trouble again, and only her aunt believes that she is worth the fight.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nFor a very small budget, Undeserved sports a lot of good production qualities, including good camera work, video quality, and audio quality. The soundtrack is also creative, even though it tends to be a bit too loud at times. Sometimes, camera work is randomly shaky, and sometimes scenes are too dark and poorly lit. However, these issues are not completely noticeable, even if the flashback quality is bit odd. The editing is average overall, and these factors are enough to make this an above-average production, which is a great start for a new film maker with such a limited budget.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nUndeserved is definitely not afraid to take on difficult but unfortunately realistic issues within the white suburban church demographic. Though there is some obvious and expository dialogue throughout, the storyline is intriguing due to its non-typical structure. For the most part, the story unfolds in a realistic manner with a natural progression of time, even though there are some slight coincidences that help the plot along. The character are fairly well-developed even though the dialogue could be constructed a bit better. Sometimes it seems like the main characters are victimized too much, but there are plenty of good attempts to develop character motive and personality through conversations and flashbacks. However, there are a few too many montages, and issues appear to be fixed too easily in the end. There are quite a few things tacked onto the end of the film, as if time ran out, which suggests that this idea might have worked better as a series. However, this plot is overall average.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThough this cast is mostly inexperienced and ‘amateur,’ they appear to be professional in their performances. There is definitely evidence of coaching, and although there are some slightly forced emotions and some moments that are partially underwhelming and awkward. However, there is far more good here than bad, and this is only amplified by the fact that the cast does not have ‘big names’ in it. In summary, this rounds out a very good first film effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s hard to get the necessary funding for a first-time small church film, so the best thing a film maker can do is craft a good plot, coaching cast members well, and get the film out there. This creative team made efforts on all three of these fronts, and for the most part, the efforts paid off. One can hardly do better than this with a less than $50,000 budget except perhaps forge a more captivating storyline. In the end, a film like Undeserved is all we really ask of freshman creators, so it will be interesting to see what this team produces next.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nKeturah by Lisa T. Bergren\n\nPlot & Storyline Quality (2 points)\n\nKeturah marks the beginning of Lisa T. Bergren’s new The Sugar Baron’s Daughters series, and while it has promise, it also has room for improvement. Firstly, Bergren is obviously quite capable of crafting a well-researched and historically accurate novel, and she has a noticeable talent for crafting characters with good backstories. However, I felt that at times the plot could have taken some different turns, and wonder if it was necessary for the two main characters to fall in love in this novel. Why not wait until later in the series? This would give them time to establish a real relationship. The opening chapters of Keturah introduce us to both the Banning sisters, Keturah, Verity, and Selah, and to Gray Covington, a neighbor and friend who happens to be a eligible bachelor…with no money. Keturah was recently widowed…which was both a curse and blessing, for although she is free from her husband’s abuse, his words and actions live on in her mind. On top of this, her father has just died and left her in charge of both family estate and Tabletop, his failing sugar plantation in the West Indies. Keturah has no idea how to run such a business, but is determined to learn. No man will ever take advantage of her again, she decides, it is best to avoid their company as much as possible. Based on this reasoning, Keturah decides to journey to the Indies and stay there for a few years in an attempt to restore Tabletop to it’s former glory. Her sisters, completely ignorant of the inhumane conditions overseas, agree to join her. Gray Covington has assumed the role of managing his father’s plantation in the West Indies, and, reinforced by Keturah’s decision to travel to the same, decides to also make the journey. Gray, who has loved Keturah since childhood, felt helpless as he watched her suffer through an unhappy and abusive marriage, but now that her husband is dead, he feels that he has a second chance to win her heart. However, despite his best attempts, he is coldly denied even friendship…at first. When Keturah and her sisters arrive in the Indies, they are appalled at the brutality inflicted upon their fellow human beings, and Keturah quickly discovers that nothing is as she expected…and that she does, in fact, need help from others. As one tragedy leads to another, will the Banning sisters survive the island? Will Keturah learn to love again? To answer these questions, read the book! On the whole, this plot is engaging and well-crafted. However, some of the interactions between Gray and Keturah are on the brink of suggestive, and the villian character is a bit of a straw-man. For these two reasons, Bergren receives an average score in this section.\n\nCharacter Development (3 points)\n\nOn a positive note, Bergren’s strength is her characters. Keturah is very well-developed and relatable. Her experiences are an accurate depiction of the harsh reality that is abusive relationships, and her struggle to trust again and forgive God is realistic. This makes her the best character in the novel. Gray is also a good character, but sometimes his part in the story feels rushed. It is as if he is being held back from reaching his full potential. As previously mentioned, it is my opinion that this could have been remedied by not forcing Keturah and Gray to fall in love all in one book. A gradual romance would have been a great improvement, for even though Gray and Keturah grew up together, their adult selves are quite changed from who they were as children. Finally, the secondary characters are simply average. If Bergren changes a few things, her score in this section could be perfect.\n\nCreativity & Originality (.5 point)\n\nWhile there are some creative and original aspects in this plot, there are also many predictable moments and overused plot devices found throughout. Therefore, I am giving Bergren a half point in originality for creating a strong heroine and portraying the horrors of slavery accurately. On the whole, this is a good read, and there are many who will enjoy it. I feel that with a few changes, this book could be the start of a great historical Christian miniseries. The screenwriter would need to downplay the romance and bring the secondary characters closer to the story, but it can be done. To conclude, good job Ms. Bergren, I believe that you have the potential to do great things with this new series!\n\nWish List Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe House at Saltwater Point by Colleen Coble\n\nAuthor’s Note: We were provided with an ARC of this novel in exchange for a fair and honest review.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (2.5 points)\n\nThe House at Saltwater Point is the second book in Coble’s Lavender Tides series. While the first book, The View From Rainshadow Bay, was well-received by most critics, this newer novel has received mixed reviews. In short, opinions about this novel seem to be split right down the middle, some love it, some do not. I tend to fall somewhere in the middle, this novel is neither really good nor really bad. It is simply your average romantic suspense story. Ellie Blackmore and her partner Jason are house flippers based in Lavender Tides, Washington, who enjoy both the work and the fruits of their labors. Ellie and Jason are in the middle of completing a project and purchasing a new house to flip when both their worlds turn upside down. One day while Ellie and Jason are getting ready to leave for a lunch break, Jason and Ellie’s sister Mackenzie (Mac), who happens to be his ex-wife, get into an argument that ends in a conflict between Mac and Ellie. Mac storms out and Ellie is left hurt and confused. Shortly after this conflict Ellie pursues her sister….only to find a large pool of blood on the deck of Mac’s new boat. Mac is nowhere to be found, and Ellie is left to assume the worst. Grayson Bradshaw is a Coast Guard investigator who is looking for notorious terrorist Terek Nasser, the man who killed his best friend. When Grayson discovers a cocaine theft linked to Terek and his men, he pursues it, takes out Terek’s right hand man, and eventually arrives in Lavender Tides to investigate further. His investigation leads him to a connection between Mac’s dissapearance and the cocaine theft. Ellie refuses to believe that her sister was involved in anything illegal, but the facts are looking more and more incriminating. Grayson is also fighting a growing attraction to Ellie, a fact which conflicts with his need to remain emotionally unattached from the case. Is Mac guilty? Can Ellie love a man who suspects her beloved sister? To answer these questions, read the book! The major strength of this plot line is the mostly unpredictable plot twists and turns. However, I observed that there are two major weaknesses. First, the book seems a bit hastily written. And second, the story is a bit rushed and is driven by facts, rather than characters.\n\nCharacter Development (2 points)\n\nLikewise, because the plot is not character-driven, Ellie and Grayson are difficult to relate to through the use of third person. However, there is a lot of potential here. Ellie and Grayson both have great backstories that Coble uses to influence their present state. Furthermore, Grayson is Coble’s strongest character in this novel because she uses key psychological trauma elements to unfold his part of the story. Jason is also a good character, but he seems incomplete. The only other weakness to point out here is the unnecessary explanations for each character’s existence as they appear in the story. Therefore, character development rounds out to be a slightly above average performance.\n\nCreativity and Originality (1 point)\n\nLastly, Coble earns a point for creativity because of her well-crafted use of suppressed childhood trauma. This type of creativity is not often seen in the suspense genre, therefore, I commend Coble on her effort in this area. However, she could improve in the area of originality. In comparison, Coble’s strength is crafting a strong storyline with a good ending. Therefore, I think this novel could make an interesting Christian drama/suspense film. I feel that a screenwriter could take the strongest characters; Ellie, Grayson, Mac, and Jason, and create a character driven suspense plot that employs the good psychological elements that Coble has already created. To sum things up, good job Ms. Coble, you have the potential to be a light in the shadows of suspense novels. I am excited to read the next novel in the Lavender Tides series!\n\nWish List Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOut of the Ashes by Kimberley Woodhouse & Tracie Peterson\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (2 points)\n\nKimberley Woodhouse and Tracie Peterson have banded together to write The Heart of Alaska series, and I must say, their partnership was a great idea. These two authors are better together than either one was alone. Woodhouse brings poignancy, sarcastic humor, and the influence of a strong faith. Peterson brings experience, romance, and a new spiritual depth that I have never seen before. So far they have written two books in the series, the second being fairly new on the market. This new novel, titled Out of the Ashes, is a self-proclaimed reflection of real life occurrences, but more on that later. The opening chapters introduce the readers to a few new characters, brother and sister Collette and Jean-Michel Langelier, and Katherine Demarchis. Jean-Michel is a man wounded both physically and mentally; following the horrific events of combat overseas, and a life-altering battle scar, he returns to his home and is faced with his father’s sudden death. Left alone in the world to care for his younger sister Collette, Jean-Michel feels depressed and abandoned by God. It is enough that God kept he and his true love from being together, he thinks, and now he takes my father away. Jean-Michel hardens his heart against God, even as PTSD causes him to toss and turn through nights haunted with dark dreams. The hand of Providence has just saved Katherine Demarchis from her abusive husband by allowing the drunken wretch to slip on ice to his death. She feels no sorrow at his death, only relief. However, his missing presence is only physical, for she can still hear his voice and feel his abuse. The physical and mental wounds she suffered will only be healed by the Hand of God, but she must choose Him over the dark voices in her head. Katherine’s grandmother, worried for her granddaughter’s sanity, arranges a summer trip to Alaska that she hopes will bring healing and a renewed mind. Furthermore, she secretly beseeches Jean-Michel to join them so that Katherine will be reminded that there are good men in the world. Will Jean-Michel and Katherine allow God to heal their broken lives? Will they choose life because He lives? To answer these questions, read the book! In the foreword both authors speak of how this novel was inspired from personal struggles that each has recently experienced. I believe that these struggles have greatly strengthened the faith of each author, and that they have become better writers and people because of them.\n\nCharacter Development (3 points)\n\nTracie Peterson’s strength was always in character development, but when Woodhouse and Peterson work on characters together, the results are even better. This is why character development is this novel’s strength. Each character, whether they be primary or secondary, are well-crafted, believable, and contain a depth never before seen from these authors. Jean-Michel is not a straw-man atheist, and Katherine is not the typical damsel in distress character. Rather, each character, including Collette, is portrayed as a person with strengths, weaknesses, and a common need for a loving Savior. The only flaw to point out here is the use of third person. If the authors had used first person for each character, they would have earned a perfect score in this category. Finally, I enjoyed the characters in this novel more than I thought I would, and think that the authors have done an admirable job in this area.\n\nCreativity & Originality (.5 point)\n\nLastly, the weakest area of this novel is creativity and originality. While there were some creative and even a few original elements, there was also a healthy dose of predictability. However, as it is hard to write an unpredictable romance plot, I cannot judge them too harshly. There is really no difference in this novel and a Janette Oke work (she was my first favorite author), for she often uses third person as well. Therefore, I applaud Woodhouse and Peterson on their effort to stand out in an overcrowded genre, and think that this series would make an interesting Christian/inspirational TV show in the historical romance category. At the very least, it could be a better version of a When Calls the Heart style show, because the audience could actually get to know the characters. In short, well done ladies, your strengths shine in this book, and I am excited to read the next installment.\n\nWish List Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWild Faith (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter the Civil War, Emmett returned to his hometown to take care of the widow of one of his fellow troops in order to fulfill a promise he made. Emmett and his son live with the African-American widow and her daughter, which causes them extra scrutiny in the corrupt small town they live near. Emmett’s father-in-law, the local pastor, is against him, as are several other colorful characters. Everything comes to a head one day when the circus train breaks down in the forest and unwittingly releases wild beasts into the woods. The children are caught in the middle of the animal escape and a kidnapping plot aimed at hurting Emmett, and it will take wild faith to overcome to dark night before them.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nFor years, DJ Perry, Shane Hagedorn, and their team have struggled with poor production quality and overly artistic attempts. However, while the artistry is still present in Wild Faith, a higher production level has finally been achieved. This is evidenced by great camera work and video quality even in the realistic and complex war scenes. There are great action shots, as well as historically authentic sets, props, and locations. Audio quality is also great, and the soundtrack is creative. The only nitpick to raise here relates to some slightly confusing editing, but this is a small issue compared to the great improvement that has been shown here. Perry and Hagedorn have proven that never giving up and working to improve pays off in the end.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nThough the beginning of this plot is a bit disorienting at first, if you stick with it, things begin to make more sense. Where the characters are a bit raw at first, they become more realistic as time progresses with the exception of the cheesy villains. Some of the dialogue is a bit vague at times, but there are also some good conversations throughout that reveal character motive, which is a rarity to find in Christian film. The overall plot structure of this film is fairly unique and creative as it effectively uses flashbacks and other psychological elements to keep things interesting. This story is a great attempt to be different rather than the typical inspirational fodder, but there are some opportunities for improvement especially in the areas of character refinement and storyline organization. Some of the dialogue is a bit obvious at times, but Wild Faith takes an honest look at corrupt small town Christianity and the pain of racism after the Civil War. Overall, this film shows a lot of potential in this team.\n\nActing Quality (1.5 points)\n\nSurprisingly, the acting of this movie is also fairly good. This DJ Perry character is likely his best performance to date. Shane Hagedorn starts out a bit rough at first, but his character is a slow burn and begins to refine as it goes on. The villain cast members are fairly poor and drag down this score, and there are a few overdone emotional moments, but on the whole, this is a good acting performance that caps off a suprisingly enjoyable film.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe always look for improvement across films, and we are always glad when Christian film makers don’t give up and continue to try things. Experience is hopefully going to lead to improvement, as is listening to constructive criticism. The Perry and Hagedorn team has wandered in the film wilderness for a few years now, from Ashes of Eden to 40 Nights and Chasing the Star. To be honest, I did not have high hopes for Wild Faith when it was first sent to me, but I was pleasantly surprised. Whether or not this film becomes a series, it is clear that this creative team has a lot of potential in front of them, so it will be interesting to see what they produce next.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Visual Bible: Acts (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAfter Jesus Resurrected from the dead, He charged His disciples to go out and complete the work He had begun by making new disciples and building His kingdom on earth. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to give His followers power, and they spread His Gospel to ends of their known world. God also raised up an unlikely champion of the faith in Paul of Tarsus, who formerly persecuted the very people he joined forced with. Through the power of God, the followers of Jesus turned the world upside down.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nMuch like the other installments of The Visual Bible saga, Acts demonstrates superb production quality, including in the areas of video quality, audio quality, and camera work. The soundtrack is a bit generic, but the sets, props, and locations are excellent in historical and cultural authenticity. There are virtually no errors to point out here—except for the fact that there is no editing, which is by design. In the end, however, this is a top-notch production.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nActs demonstrates the same ambition as other Visual Bible films, which cover entire books of the Bible in one film. Unfortunately, while there are many excellent stories in the book of Acts, this rendition is simply too long to have full impact. Once again, designed narration hurts character development and thus makes this more of an informational resource than a drama film. However, it still has its place, even though this film tends to have a strange portrayal of angels. In the end, the historical accounts therein are very enjoyable and worth a watch.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nUnfortunately, Acts still contains the Visual Bible struggle for cultural authenticity as not many of the cast members are culturally appropriate. While there are some moments that are too theatrical, this cast is mostly professional even still, with good emotions and line delivery. Also, costuming is a major plus. This rounds out another generally average effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt least this depiction of Acts is not cheesy, but one has to wonder what it would have been like if this was a series. It seems like it would have had great impact. Actually, Mark Burnett and Roma Downey already tried that. However, I think we are still due a good series based on the book of Acts. Any takers?\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDifferent Drummers [2013] (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen an unlikely friendship develops between David, a boy with muscular dystrophy, and Lyle, a boy diagnosed with ADHD, David sets out to show Lyle that God really does exist. As they collaborate on a science project contest that Lyle is determined to win, they form a close bond, and David finds a new purpose in life. Though they get into various escapades and scrapes that are not easy to get out of, their coming of age journey is one that they will never forget.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nFor the most part, Different Drummers is a fine production that has a lot of high marks. These include great video quality, camera work, and audio quality. Though the soundtrack is a bit generic, it is not a detractor. Sets, locations, and props are all what they should be and are utilized effectively. Overall, this is a professional production that is only hurt by some awkward cuts and transitions. However, this is not enough to keep this section from having a respectably high score.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nDifferent Drummers, in many ways, is too much of a ‘silly’ kids story, as it is a coming of age plotline. As such, there are a lot of seemingly unnecessary goofy sequences that tend to just fill time. However, this storyline also presents a realistic and believable portrayal of special needs people, as well as an honest look at the dangers that come about when children are over-medicated. However, the Christian message is a bit too vague, even though dialogue is fairly well-constructed. Even so, there isn’t much substantial content to work with here as the story tends to hop from one thing to the next without much focus, but this could be an extrapolation of the main character’s ADHD, so it may be excusable in some ways. In the end, this story has a realistic ending, and it will be mostly enjoyable for many audiences, so it may be worth a watch.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThe casting and acting of this film is mostly fine, considering the number of younger cast members. Though there are some awkward performances (perhaps purposely) and some over the top emotions in some scenes, for the most part, this cast is professional. Each cast member tends to be cast well, and line delivery is solid throughout. This rounds out an above average film all around.\n\nConclusion\n\nFilms like Different Drummers should be more commonplace in Christian film than they are. Funding is used well, the story is at least halfway interesting, and the acting is adequate. Though there some clear steps that could have been taken to make this film a higher rating, as it is, many audiences will enjoy it. Still, we can’t help but wonder the potential these sorts of films could have had.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSame Kind of Different As Me (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nRon Hall is a successful art dealer who has it all—except for a successful marriage. He and his wife Debbie have grown apart from each other, and he has been looking in the wrong directions for love. His marital conflict has now come to a head, so Debbie decides to make Ron exit his safe, affluent world to come volunteer with her at the local homeless shelter. While there, though his heart is not in the work at all, Ron forms an unlikely relationship with a violent homeless man whose story captivates Ron in a way he never expected.\n\nProduction Quality (2.5 points)\n\nAs a clearly well-funded and well-marketed production, Same Kind of Different As Me had a lot going for it from the get-go. This production is obviously high quality in a lot of ways, including video quality, camera work, and audio quality. The soundtrack is also very intriguing. Sets, locations, and props are very well-constructed and utilized appropriately, especially the historical components in the flashbacks. The only minor nitpick to note here pertains to some small editing issues, such as lagging scenes and awkward transitions. Otherwise, this production is top-notch.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nAs Same Kind of Different As Me is based on a book and a true story, sometimes it seems like it’s too much like a book turned into a movie. This is evident in unnecessary narration and obvious dialogue that tends to spoon-feed the story to the viewer. Some of the characters tend to be portrayed too perfectly, yet this is a great true story despite these flaws. The flashbacks are used in highly effective ways and are actually the highlights of the film because of the story they tell. There are a lot of great messages and lessons to learn from this story, but we would have liked it if this film indulged less in drama and more in the opportunity it had to portray an epic story full of realistic, flawed, and accessible characters. As mentioned before, there are too many lagging and choppy scenes that hurt this goal from coming to fruition. However, there is enough good to make this at least an interesting movie to watch.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nThough this movie is mostly professionally cast, there are a few issues that keep this section from being all that it could be. For one, the lead actor and actress sometimes seem to be phoning in their performances, and at times they are too dramatic. However, Djimon Hounsou and Jon Voight are particularly well-cast and well-acted; these two almost save this cast on their own. Moreover, other cast members outside of Greg Kinnear and Renée Zellweger are also fine and post good performances. In the end, this punctuates an above average film that could have gone further.\n\nConclusion\n\nSame Kind of Different As Me had everything going for it, but it stopped just short of greatness. The excellent true story and high amount of funding almost forced this film to be above-average from the beginning, but the pedestrian nature of its presentation and its over-indulgence in drama apart from character development tripped it up. In the end, we can’t help but wonder if this was another one of those movies designed to make a quick cash grab at the theaters rather than make a real difference, which seems like the original intent of the book’s authors. We may never know, but this is at least a fine film that most audiences will enjoy.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nChristmas Oranges (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nRose is an orphan girl who lives in Mrs. Hartley’s orphan home. However, when Mrs. Hartley and some of the children die of illness one fateful month, all of the orphans are sent to other places. Rose and some of her friends are sent to live in the orphanage of the angry Mr. Crampton, who has strict rules and doesn’t want children messing around with his stuff. However, the more Rose learns about Mr. Crampton, the more she learns that he is hurting during the holiday season and needs someone to love him.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nAs usual for John Lyde and his creative teams, Christmas Oranges is a professional production. This is evidenced by good video quality, audio quality, and camera work. The soundtrack is somewhat generic, but it is fine for the genre. Locations are mostly fine, even though there are few of them, but the sets are limited in scope. There are also some random scenes that are poorly lit for no clear reason. However, on the flip side, the editing is surprisingly effective. On the whole, this is a high quality effort that has become commonplace from this group.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1.5 points)\n\nIn a different turn from other stories from John Lyde and company, Christmas Oranges has a uniquely substantial plot that contains the accessible struggles of relatively believable characters. Though there is narration that hurts things, the child characters are actually pretty good, even if the orphan premise is slightly cheesy. There are also some silly ‘kids’ sequences and montages, along with some strawman characters. However, for the most part, the dialogue and the ideas therein are mostly meaningful and do their best to avoid cliched Christmas concepts involving orphans. Probably the best element of this storyline is its use of realistic character backstories to humanize the ‘bad’ characters. On the whole, while this movie did not go as far as it could have, it is still enjoyable and is worth a watch.\n\nActing Quality (2 points)\n\nWhile most of the cast members are definitely professional, this section still tends to be a mixed bag. Some cast members seem to be overdoing their performances just a bit. However, on the whole, emotions are realistic, and line delivery is on point. As a side note, costuming is historically authentic. Overall, this rounds out a very professional effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Covenant Communications\\Paulist Productions\\Mainstay Productions collaboration has been working for years to make respectable films, and for the most part, they have succeeded. However, they have been plagued by an inability to get over the last proverbial hill that stands between them and film greatness. Nonetheless, they have all the tools necessary to do so. Thus, we believe that sometime in the near future, they will finally break through and make that dynamic film that has alluded them for years.\n\nFinal Rating: 5.5 out of 10 points\n\nRate this:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nFaith-Filled Christmas (Movie Review)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nThe Fairway family has three generations of people who want to serve people at Christmastime.

However, their trouble-making friend Byron wants to put on a senior Olympics at the facility while the heavy-handed superior is away. Simon’s and Emily’s adopted son Walter and his wife Ruth have opened their home to foster children, and they have unique struggles to handle during the holidays as they have to deal with biological parents. Yet all of them find different ways to show the love of Christ to those around them.\n\nProduction Quality (2 points)\n\nAlthough this is an ‘indie’ production, it is a clear that a lot of work went into it. This shows up in great video quality, camera work, and audio quality. The soundtrack is also engaging, although it tends to get in the way at times by covering up dialogue. Sets, locations, and props are also well-constructed and well-used. The only other issues to point are some minor editing issues, such as lagging scenes and dead sequences. However, as a whole, this is a great effort that shows great potential for the future.\n\nPlot and Storyline Quality (1 point)\n\nThis good effort also spills over into the plot, as there are lots of good ideas in it. For the most part, the characters are realistic and believable due to well-thought-out dialogue. However, there are also too many characters and too many subplots going on here. With so much content, more organization was in order, yet not enough was given. Though there are some moments of good comedy, there are also some moments of flat humor. Also, a lot of the time, this movie plays out more like the premiere of a series rather than a film. It has a very episodic feel rather than the proper arc of a movie plot. Nonetheless, it’s good to experiment with your first film, as long as it’s not horrible, to see what you’re good at. Thus, it seems like this was accomplished in this plot.\n\nActing Quality (2.5 points)\n\nThough this cast is only semi-professional and contains ‘amateurs,’ the cast members only commit minor errors. Emotions are believable, and line delivery is usually on point. The only slight drawbacks here pertain to some measured or awkward line delivery, but it’s not much to write home about. In the end, this rounds out a very good indie effort that will be something to build off of in the next project.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese days, freshman films seem to be getting better"
