        "text": "TL;DR –.We explore the highs and lows, and lows, of the Transformers film series.\n\nDisclosure – I paid for the Paramount+/Amazon Prime services that viewed these films.\n\nTransformers –\n\nWe might be in the era of nostalgia, but that does not mean that current films can capture what made those original properties soar. An excellent example of this is Transformers, a series that swings wildly in quality and in how it connects with the series it is based on, and now I have watched them all.\n\nTransformers Review –\n\nDiving back into this film was interesting because I had some very distinct reactions from when I watched it in cinemas all those many years ago. Still, if nothing else, it is a perfect snapshot of the cinematic and cultural landscape of the time. Watching it now, you see how revolutionary it was for its time, but also how it did not understand the property it was adapting in many ways.\n\nOne of the film’s strengths is its production, there are many things you can say about Michael Bay’s directing, but the man understands the role of spectacle, and if nothing else, this film revels in the spectacle. The explosions are significant, the robots slam into each other in crushing blows, and that camera be spinning. Those climatic battles look stunning, with a blend of practical and digital effects that have stood the test of time.\n\nHowever, for all the good it does, there are elements that it fails miserably. The first is understanding the material that they were adapting. For example, I don’t have a significant issue with the transformed versions they used, but it is clear that financial choices were the primary consideration for many of the car designs that should not have been changed. Then there was the choice to have all the Decepticons, bar Megatron be voiced in an alien language that removes any chance of having a personality. They just become carbon copies rather than actual characters.\n\nSome fundamental narrative issues still make no sense. For example, why does the Allspark only create Decepticons? Why would a competent commander who knows Decepticons can hide as cars take the most important item to the nearest populated city? The more you think, the more it falls apart. I give it a bit of a pass because you can tell that this needed more keys in the script phase, which could not happen because of the writer’s strike. But that is not the case in the future.\n\nWas it bad, well no, was it good, well also no. We get hints of something fantastic, large stretches of frustration, and then it is mostly average. If nothing else, ending the song on What I’ve Done by Linkin Park was iconic.\n\nDirected by – Michael Bay\n\nStory by – John Rogers, Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman\n\nScreenplay by – Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman\n\nMusic by – Steve Jablonsky\n\nCinematography by – Mitchell Amundsen\n\nEdited by – Paul Rubell, Glen Scantlebury & Thomas A. Muldoon\n\nProduction/Distribution Companies – DreamWorks Pictures, Hasbro, Di Bonaventura Pictures & Paramount Pictures\n\nStarring – Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Jon Voight, Michael O’Neill, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Amaury Nolasco, Zack Ward, W. Morgan Sheppard, Bernie Mac, John Robinson & Travis Van Winkle with Peter Cullen, Mark Ryan, Darius McCrary, Robert Foxworth, Jess Harnell, Hugo Weaving, Jim Wood, Reno Wilson & Charlie Adler\n\nPost-Credit Scene – There are Mid-Credit Scenes\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen Review –\n\nWell, if the first film was a generally average joint, with big swings into the great and awful, the follow-up takes all the problems of the first and then doubles down on them like an utterly frustrating mess.\n\nLet’s rip the Band-Aid of bad off and dive into the rubbish. To start with, this film doubles down on the weirdly racially-tinged slapstick from the first outing. For example, they ruin the Devastator by giving them a pair of swinging balls for no reason other than to make the unneeded crassness. The less said about the Twins, the better. All of this is unnecessary and takes away from the film as it ups the juvenile level of proceeds that was already there with awkward upskirt shots and unneeded slow-mo.\n\nYou can also feel that it is a snapshot of its time, not in a good way. There is an oddly Americanised worldview on the show which looks silly in some regards today that China would just allow foreign militaries to blow up a city. Or Egypt, for that matter. But there is also this persistent view that everywhere outside the US is a ruin. Also, a weird undercurrent that elected government is terrible, so we should focus on the military.\n\nWhile the Parents feel like a bit more rounded characters this time, there continues to be the cookie-cutter approach to some of the Autobots and Decepticons, leading to a complete lack of personality. There are hints of a good narrative here, but it is hidden behind an epic pile of bloat. On that note of good ideas that fall flat is the human-Decepticon that sufferers from truly odd over-sexualisation.\n\nThere were narrative issues with the last film that you could sort of handwave away as the first outing but are frankly inexcusable in the second outing.\n\nDirected by – Michael Bay\n\nScreenplay by – Ehren Kruger, Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman\n\nMusic by – Steve Jablonsky\n\nCinematography by – Ben Seresin\n\nEdited by – Roger Barton, Paul Rubell, Joel Negron & Thomas A. Muldoon\n\nProduction/Distribution Companies – DreamWorks Pictures, Hasbro, Di Bonaventura Pictures & Paramount Pictures\n\nStarring – Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Ramon Rodriguez, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, Isabel Lucas, John Benjamin Hickey, Glenn Morshower, Matthew Marsden, Rainn Wilson & Michael Papajohn with Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, Tony Todd, Mark Ryan, Jess Harnell, Robert Foxworth, Charlie Adler, André Sogliuzzo, Tom Kenny, Reno Wilson, Grey DeLisle, Calvin Wimmer, John DiCrosta, Michael York, Kevin Michael Richardson & Robin Atkin Downes\n\nPost-Credit Scene – There are Mid-Credit Scenes\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon Review –\n\nWe now dive into the film that wins one category, which is the most stupid name that had to happen because they probably did not have the rights to the ‘dark side of the moon’. However, it might be the only award it wins.\n\nSo this is the point where I give an exasperated sigh because, once again, the film continues down a path that just makes for uncomfortable viewing. Women are filmed in ways that could almost be called upskirting at times. Instead of learning about the racist issues from the last film, they add new and awkward ways to slip it in.\n\nOne of the main issues with this first trilogy of films is that when you break it down, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is just a profoundly unlikeable protagonist. I don’t care about his motivations, his life, or even if he lives through the film. Because so many of these first films are based around him to the exclusion of even the titular Transformers, it is a big issue.\n\nThen we have an execution problem, a sentence that I never thought I would utter. Throughout this series, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) executes Decepticons even when they are defenceless and pleading for mercy. Here we see him do that twice to two different characters that were surrendering, and he is presented as a hero. When Decepticons did the same thing earlier in the film and were rightly condemned for it in the narrative.\n\nIf nothing else, it looks like John Malkovich was having a blast. The sky suits were cool, and tricking Megatron into helping was an interesting idea that at least fits with who he is as a character. But that’s about it.\n\nDirected by – Michael Bay\n\nStory by – Ehren Kruger\n\nMusic by – Steve Jablonsky\n\nCinematography by – Amir Mokri\n\nEdited by – Roger Barton, William Goldenberg & Joel Negron\n\nProduction/Distribution Companies – Hasbro, Di Bonaventura Pictures & Paramount Pictures\n\nStarring – Shia LaBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Patrick Dempsey, Kevin Dunn, Julie White, John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Keiko Agena, Lester Speight, Josh Kelly, Alan Tudyk, Ken Jeong, Glenn Morshower, Buzz Aldrin, Elya Baskin, Andy Daly, Iqbal Theba, Sammy Sheik & Mindy Sterling with Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, Leonard Nimoy, Jess Harnell, Charlie Adler, Robert Foxworth, James Remar, Francesco Quinn, George Coe, Tom Kenny, Reno Wilson, Frank Welker, Ron Bottitta, John DiMaggio, Keith Szarabajka & Greg Berg\n\nPost-Credit Scene – There are Mid-Credit Scenes\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction Review –\n\nWell, we have moved away from that first trilogy of films, and it is time to enter the Mark Wahlberg era and, unfortunately, and new kind of creepy. Age of Extinction is the one film from this series that I had not seen before working on this series retrospective. So, if nothing else, seeing it for the first time was interesting.\n\nI was not expecting one of the most uncomfortable love triangles I have seen in cinema. I am not sure what is the worst part of it all, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) domineering over his daughter Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz) with a persistence you would only see in a religious cult. Then there is the constant fighting between Cade and Tessa’s boyfriend, Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor), about who loves her the most. Or the extended discussion about Romeo and Juliette laws. Okay, it is the last one, but the rest are close. It is probably the most straightforward of the narratives, which does not make it particularly interesting, but at least it does not go off the rails. An uptight businessman that is out of their league, a former CIA officer with no scruples, an ineffective government operative, and a non-ironically super traditional guy that does not like backwards thinking. Did it need to be as long as it did? Absolutely not. It has also not aged well, with comments around Hong Kong and the “Central Government” aging like blue cheese left out in the Sun.\n\nHaving the new Transformers transform like small cubes was probably the easier option, but it is the least visually interesting one. T.J. Miller’s character annoyed me, so I am glad they killed him off, but that might say more about me. Stanley Tucci got a genuine laugh out of me, which might be the film’s best part. It is also probably the first film since the original that makes the most of its musical score.\n\nSo it ended up being much more uncomfortable than I expected, but also a much more solid outing than we have seen in a while. Though, I am not sure they make the most of the Dinobots.\n\nDirected by – Michael Bay\n\nStory by – Ehren Kruger\n\nMusic by – Steve Jablonsky\n\nCinematography by – Amir Mokri\n\nEdited by – William Goldenberg, Roger Barton & Paul Rubell\n\nProduction/Distribution Companies – Hasbro, Di Bonaventura Pictures & Paramount Pictures\n\nStarring – Mark Wahlberg, Kelsey Grammer, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci, Sophia Myles, Li Bingbing, Titus Welliver, T.J. Miller & James Bachman with Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Robert Foxworth, John DiMaggio, Mark Ryan & Reno Wilson\n\nTransformers: The Last Knight Review –\n\nWe have now reached the point in the series where I have written full reviews for the films, which you can read HERE. However, looking back and seeing if it holds up or falls further is still a good idea.\n\nPutting aside for a moment that this is the wildest opening in the series because you have Stanley Tucci coming back a Merlin of all people. But more than this, we have a reshaping of the Transformer’s lore about Planet Earth. Each film has had a radically different explanation for why Transformers have come to Earth, to the point that it actually invalidates the other films. Also, making Earth Unicron might be the most significant change they have ever made to the canon.\n\nIt was nice that the Decepticons actually have a personality this time around. Indeed, the Transformers didn’t feel like second fiddles in this film, and the stakes were clear and understandable. Also, I am not sure they understand what tactical nukes are.\n\nHowever, of all the films, it suffers from narrative bloat, and the design of the Decepticons has reached as far as it can go. I am not sure the film deserved the soft/hard reboot it got after it, but you could feel them slightly running out of ideas here.\n\nDirected by – Michael Bay\n\nScreenplay by – Art Marcum, Matt Holloway & Ken Nolan\n\nStory By – Akiva Goldsman, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway & Ken Nolan\n\nBased on – Transformers by Hasbro\n\nMusic by – Steve Jablonsky\n\nCinematography by – Jonathan Sela\n\nEdited by – Roger Barton, Adam Gerstel, Debra Neil-Fisher, John Refoua, Mark Sanger & Calvin Wimmer\n\nStarring – Mark Wahlberg, Josh Duhamel, Laura Haddock, Stanley Tucci, Anthony Hopkins, Isabela Moner, John Turturro, Santiago Cabrera, Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, John DiMaggio, Omar Sy, Gemma Chan & Jim Carter\n\nBumblebee Review –\n\nHowever, just when you thought they could not put together a Transformers film, we got a glimmer of hope. You can read our full review of Bumblebee HERE.\n\nOne of the things I remember from my initial screening was the joy people felt when they saw all the versions of the Gen 1 Transformers on the big screen for the first time. It was almost like people liked when you engaged adequately with the content you were adapting. The whole opening sequence, including ending up with amnesia, was the best opening the films have done.\n\nAdd to this. I think they nailed the transforming animation, with Bumblebee transforming around a shocked Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) being one of the best visual moments in the series. And look, you can’t help but feel the joy when Jack Burns (John Cena) announces his concern that they are called Decepticons.\n\nThere is a tight narrative focus, which helps propel the story forward. Add some funny moments and genuine emotion, and you get the best Transformers live-action film to date.\n\nCredits – All images were created by the cast, crew, and production companies of Bumblebee\n\nDirected by – Travis Knight\n\nWritten by – Christina Hodson\n\nBased on –Transformers by Hasbro\n\nMusic by – Dario Marianelli\n\nCinematography by – Enrique Chediak\n\nEdited by – Paul Rubell\n\nStarring – Hailee Steinfeld, John Cena, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., John Ortiz, Jason Drucker, Pamela Adlon, Stephen Schneider, Rory Markham, Len Cariou, Dylan O’Brien, Peter Cullen, Grey Griffin, Steve Blum, Andrew Morgado, Kirk Baily, Dennis Singletary, Angela Bassett, Justin Theroux, David Sobolov & Jon Bailey\n\nPost-Credit Scene – There is a Mid-Credit Scene\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts Review –\n\nLast but not least, is the latest film in the franchise that is not even out in general release in my home country at the time of writing. You can read our full Transformers: Rise of the Beasts review HERE.\n\nIt was nice to find that they can do one of these big full-cast films they can actually write human protagonists that are not annoying. The addition of the Maximals was a good touch, but they did need some balance with the missing Predacons.\n\nIt had a strong narrative and character moments, and the design of the Transformers was sound, but it struggled with its generic ending, which has been done in the series before.\n\nDirected by – Steven Caple Jr.\n\nScreenplay by – Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber & Jon Hoeber\n\nStory by – Joby Harold\n\nBased on – Transformers by Hasbro\n\nMusic by – Jongnic Bontemps\n\nCinematography by – Enrique Chediak\n\nEdited by – Joel Negron & William Goldenberg\n\nProduction/Distribution Companies – Skydance Media, Hasbro, New Republic Pictures, Di Bonaventura Pictures, Bay Films & Paramount Pictures\n\nStarring – Anthony Ramos, Dominique Fishback, Luna Lauren Vélez, Dean Scott Vazquez, Tobe Nwigwe, Sarah Stiles, Michael Kelly & Lucas Huarancca with Peter Cullen, Ron Perlman, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, Liza Koshy, John DiMaggio, David Sobolov, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Colman Domingo, Cristo Fernández & Tongayi Chirisa\n\nPost-Credit Scene – There is a Mid-Credit Scene\n\nWell, this was not quite the experience I expected, while it has these moments that stand the test of time. The arrival of the Transformers in the first film is still a moment that stands up, and the score sings. However, when it is terrible, it is so awful. I am glad that Michael Bay has matured as a filmmaker recently, with Ambulance being an excellent example. Because when you look back at some of these early films, you feel the weight of bad decisions wherever you look."
