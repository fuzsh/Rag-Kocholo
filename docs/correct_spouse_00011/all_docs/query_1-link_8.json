At the time of his arrest, he reportedly owed $53,000 in child support. He is supposed to pay his ex, Tammy Brawner, $1,366 per month.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMcCrary was born on May 1, 1976, in Walnut, California.

It was positively reviewed by audiences and critics alike and received numerous awards and nominations. During the show's run, McCrary received three Young Artist Award nominations.\n\nAfter Family Matters ended in 1998, McCrary continued booking television and film roles. He booked the lead role in \"Something to Sing About,\" a Christian drama produced by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

He also reunited with his \"Family Matters co-star, Kellie Shanygne Williams, on UPN's show, \"Eve,\" for two episodes. In 2007, he booked the voice role of Jazz in the \"Transformers\" film. He booked another voice role in 2009 for Tarix in the film, \"Bionicle: The Legend Reborn.\" Notable films he appeared in during this time include \"Next Day Air\" and \"Saw IV.\" He also appeared in a number of theater productions, including \"The Maintenance Man.\"\n\nIn 2009, he booked his next large regular cast role when he joined \"The Young and the Restless\" for two seasons as the character Malcolm Winters. By the time he left in 2011, he was ready to release his first album as he had grown interested in exploring music. He also appeared as part of the recurring cast in \"Anger Management\" in 2012,\" \"The Leftovers\" in 2015, and \"Star\" in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, he joined the cast of the show, \"Monogamy,\" and then appeared in the film, \"True to the Game 2\" in 2020. He reprised his role the following year in \"True to the Game 3.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMcCrary married Juliette Vann in 2005, but the couple divorced in 2006. In 2009, he married longtime friend Karrine Steffans, an author. They divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Tammy Brawner. Together, they share a daughter named Zoey. They remained together until 2017, when they divorced.\n\nMcCrary is the founder of the FathersCare organization, a non-profit that is committed to empowering fathers with education and assistance in order to improve their relationships with their children.
