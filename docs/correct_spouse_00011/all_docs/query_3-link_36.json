        "text": "The role of Edward “Eddie” Winslow, the firstborn son of Carl and Harriette Winslow, in the 1989–1998 ABC/CBS sitcom Family Matters catapulted American actor, rapper, singer, and producer Darius McCrary to stardom. The 1987 comedy Big Shots was his first film role, in which he played the role of Scam. Additionally, he provided the voice for Jazz in Transformers. In addition, he played the part of photojournalist Malcolm Winters on the CBS daytime serial The Young and the Restless from 2009 until 2011.\n\nWhat is Darius McCrary’s Net Worth?\n\nIn 2024, Darius will have a net worth of almost $100 million. The role of Eddie Winslow on “Family Matters” catapulted Darius McCrary to fame as an American actor and musician. There were a total of 215 episodes airing throughout the sitcom’s nine seasons (1989–1998). He was a regular on both “Family Matters” and “The Young and the Restless,” where he portrayed Malcolm Winters, a soap opera character.\n\nWhat is Darius McCrary’s Age?\n\nMcCrary came into this world in Walnut, California on May 1, 1976. Howard McCrary is a musician, composer, and music director; nothing is known about his mother. At a young age, his father pushed for McCrary to pursue a career in show business. Donovan is McCrary’s younger brother.\n\nCareer\n\nBeginning his career at an early age, McCrary appeared in his first film, 1987’s “Big Shots,” when he was just eleven years old. In addition to his appearances in films like “Mississippi Burning” (1988) and television series like “Amen” and “Hooperman,” he started landing roles in individual episodes.\n\nDarius McCrary guest starred on CBS’s “I Get That a Lot” on January 6, 2010, playing the role of himself. He could be seen operating the gas pump at a petrol station where Paris Hilton was playing the part of a clerk in the episode. When Hilton saw him, she had to have an autograph. At first, McCrary believed it was her duty to serve her community, but she eventually came to terms with her identity. McCrary later starred in “In-Laws From Hell,” a theater production that Andrionna L. Williams wrote, directed, and produced.\n\nDarius McCrary’s Wife\n\nAll three of Darius McCrary’s marriages ended in divorce. His ex-wives include Juliette Merrill Vann, Karrine Steffans, and Tammy Brawner. He became a parent alongside Brawner.\n\nOne of his ex-wives has spoken out about his physical abuse in an interview. In addition, she said he choked and smacked her once.\n\nHer son is from her relationship with her ex-boyfriend. Although Darius was legally her first husband, she was only married to him for a year. Troubles arose in their marriage. Her marriage to Darius was terminated due to his aggressive behavior towards her. A permanent restraining order against Darius was also filed by her because she was afraid he would hurt her again.\n\nDarius McCrary’s Height and Weight\n\nWith an estimated weight of 82 kilos (181 pounds), Darius McCrary stands at a height of 6 feet 3 inches (190.5 cm)."
