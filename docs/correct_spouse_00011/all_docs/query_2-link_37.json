        "text": "Annie Nixon Singleton (July 25, 1873 - July 25, 1960) was born in Montgomery. She, at the beginning of the twentieth century, provided a safe and supportive space in her home for a literary club of seven African American male college students. This gathering was the genesis of the first intercollegiate African American fraternity. The seven young men attended Cornell University and founded the nation’s oldest intercollegiate African American Greek-letter fraternity in 1906 in the home of Mr. Archie Singleton and Annie C. Singleton. Her father was from one of the parishes in Louisiana and her mother was from South Carolina. When she met Archie she was known as Anna Coleman from a previous union. Archie and Annie married (1904) and relocated from South Carolina to the township of Ithaca. They purchased a home at 411 East State Street in a racially mixed neighborhood where they were one of two African American families residing on the street. Archie worked as a janitor and she worked as a domestic in the home of one of the white families in Ithaca. The 1910 census shows that they had a 4-year-old daughter Mary; and, in 1920 they were raising a 17-year-old nephew Albert Nixon. They rented out an upper bedroom to Robert Harold Ogle. African American students attending Cornell University were not allowed to live on campus. Their home was one of several places where African American students lived. It was in their home that Robert Ogle and six other young African American male students from Cornell, known as Mrs. Singleton’s “boys,” met and formed a literary group out of which Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. was founded. At the 1939 General Convention in New York City, the fraternity invited her as its special guest. The name “Mother” was endeared to the brotherhood and she was designated the “Mother of Alpha Phi Alpha.” She was memorialized in 1960 at Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity’s 54th General Convention in DC. A tribute to honor “Mother” Singleton with a new headstone at Forest Lawn gravesite took place on November 16, 2011. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence #alphaphialpha\n\nJames “Jim” Hill (July 25, 1846 - June 12, 1903) was born enslaved in Marshall County, Mississippi. He was a leader of the Reconstruction Era Republican Party, chairman of the Republican state executive committee, and national committeeman of the Republican Party for Mississippi for many years. James W. Hill, the owner of the plantation where he was born, was one of the county’s most prominent citizens. It is suspected that he was his son. He was taught to read and write by his owner’s two daughters. He continued his education as a youth and apprenticed as a machinist at the railroad shops in Holly Springs. He rose to the rank of first-class mechanic. In 1868 he was elected to the Mississippi State Legislature, representing Marshall County. He was elected secretary of state of Mississippi (1874-78). He was the last 19th-century African American to be elected to statewide office in Mississippi. He was appointed district internal revenue collector by President Rutherford B. Hayes. He was named postmaster at Vicksburg in 1886. He was the only Mississippi postmaster to ever serve a full four-year term without being confirmed by the Senate. He was a candidate for land registrar again, but newly elected President Benjamin Harrison did not support his reappointment. He maintained his position as chair of the Republican State executive committee, a post he held (1884-1903). He never married. He was a member of the African Methodist Church and deputy grand master of the Black Masons in Mississippi. In 1912, an elementary school for African American children in West Jackson was founded and named in his honor. The current Jim Hill High School was constructed in 1966 on Fortune Street in Jackson. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nMinister Thomas Detter (c. 1830 -1891) late 19th-century businessman, Methodist minister, and civil rights advocate, was one of the first African American literary figures to emerge in the West. The son of a free stonemason, he was born near DC. He arrived in San Francisco where he owned his first barber shop. He established himself as a community leader and civil rights advocate. He served as the Sacramento County delegate to the first Colored Citizens of the State of California Convention and was named to the organization’s State Executive Committee. He campaigned throughout the West for the causes of public education, voting rights, and admitting testimony by African Americans in court. He spent the next three decades living in Washington, Idaho Territories, and Nevada. He resided for a time in Lewiston, Bannock, and Idaho City in Idaho Territory and Walla Walla in Washington Territory. He worked as a barber, owned bathing houses, sold cough syrups and hair restoratives, gave public addresses, and published thirty-six articles as a correspondent for two San-Francisco-based African American newspapers The Pacific Appeal and The Elevator. He moved to Elko, Nevada. He published Nellie Brown, or The Jealous Wife, with Other Sketches through a San Francisco printing firm. A collection of short stories and non-fiction pieces, Nellie Brown was ignored for many years, and rediscovered in the late 20th century. He was an early and forceful advocate of full civil rights for African Americans in the West and across the nation. In the short non-fiction sketch titled “Boise City,” he describes the capital of Idaho Territory as a place where “many of its citizens are afflicted with the terrible disease of Negrophobia… A respectable colored man can scarcely get accommodations at any of the hotels or restaurants.” He moved to Eureka, where he met and married Emily Brinson. He remained in the city for the next decade and represented the African American population of Nevada at the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nDr. David Jones Peck (1826 - January 1855) was the first African American man to graduate from an American medical school. He was born to John C. and Sarah Peck in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. John Peck was a prominent abolitionist and minister who founded the local AME Church in Carlisle. He was a barber and wigmaker. John and Sarah Peck moved to Pittsburgh in the early 1830s where they established the first school for African American children in the area. He was one of their first students. He studied medicine under Dr. Joseph P. Gaszzam, an anti-slavery white doctor in Pittsburgh. He entered Rush Medical College in Chicago. He toured the state of Ohio with William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass promoting abolitionist ideals. His status as the first African American graduate of a medical college was used by abolitionists to promote the idea of full citizenship and was implicitly an attack on slavery. In 1849 he established his practice in Philadelphia. He lived in and worked from a red brick row house with his wife, Mary E. Peck (1849). His medical practice was not successful. Few doctors recognized his status, referred patients to him, or consulted with him. He closed his medical practice in Philadelphia in 1851 and was preparing to travel to California when Martin Delany, an old friend, and fellow Pittsburgh abolitionist, persuaded him instead to participate in an emigration project that would resettle US free African Americans in Central America. Delany, he, and other Black emigrants moved to Nicaragua in 1852, settling on the east coast of the nation. The emigrants established San Juan Del Norte with Delaney as the mayor and commander of the militia. He practiced medicine and became the town physician. In 1854 he joined the Liberal side in the Nicaraguan Civil War and was killed by cannon fire in the town of Granada. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nAttorney George Boyer Vashon (July 25, 1824 - October 5, 1878) made noteworthy contributions to the fight for emancipation and education of blacks. He was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the third child and only son of an abolitionist, John Bethune Vashon. At age sixteen, Vashon enrolled in Oberlin Collegiate Institute in Ohio. He earned his BA with valedictory honors, becoming the college’s first Black graduate. He was awarded an MA in recognition of his scholarly pursuits and accomplishments. He studied law under Judge Walter Forward, a prominent figure in Pennsylvania politics. He applied for admission to the Allegheny County bar. His application was denied because people of African descent were not citizens. This inequitable act led to his decision to emigrate to Haiti. He went to New York to take the bar examination, which he completed on January 10, 1848, thus becoming the first Black lawyer in New York. He moved to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where he spent thirty months teaching Latin, Greek, and English. In the summer of 1850, he moved to Syracuse, New York to practice law. He wrote his remarkable epic poem “Vincent Oge.” He was a professor of belles-lettres and mathematics at New York Central College. He was the third African American to hold a teaching post at a college or university. He married Susan Paul Smith (1857) and the couple had seven children. He was a teacher and principal in Pittsburgh before becoming the second Black president of Avery College. He was a solicitor for the Freedmen’s Bureau and in 1869 represented Rhode Island at the national convention of Colored Men of America, later joining its national executive committee. He taught at Howard University, becoming the university’s first Black professor. He was instrumental in establishing the Howard University Law School. He taught mathematics and ancient and modern languages at Alcorn University. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nElijah Abel or Able (July 25, 1808 – December 25, 1884) was one of the earliest African American members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He is considered by many to have been the first African American elder and seventy in the LDS movement. He, although predominantly of Scotch and English descent, appears by his African heritage to have been the first and one of the few African Americans in the early history of the church to have received the priesthood. And it was his distinction to be the faith’s first missionary to have descended in part through African bloodline. But in 1849, Brigham Young declared all African Americans ineligible to hold the priesthood, and his claim to priesthood rights was challenged. As a skilled carpenter, he committed his services to the furthering of the work and the building of LDS temples. He died shortly after serving a final mission for the church (in his lifetime he officially served three) to Cincinnati. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nJohn Punch (fl. the 1630s, living 1640) was an enslaved African who lived in the colony of Virginia. Thought to have been an indentured servant, he attempted to escape to Maryland and was sentenced in July 1640 by the Virginia Governor’s Council to serve as a slave for the remainder of his life. Two European men who ran away with him received a lighter sentence of extended indentured servitude. The council sentenced the three men to thirty lashes each. For this reason, some historians consider him the “first official slave in the English colonies,” and his case as the “first legal sanctioning of lifelong slavery in the Chesapeake.” Some historians consider this to be one of the first legal distinctions between Europeans and Africans made in the colony and a key milestone in the development of the institution of slavery in the US. In July 2012, Ancestry.com published a paper suggesting that he was a twelfth-generation grandfather of President Barack Obama on his mother’s side, based on historical and genealogical research and Y-DNA analysis. His descendants were known by the Bunch or Bunche surname. He is believed to be one of the paternal ancestors of the 20th-century American diplomat Ralph Bunche, the first African American to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He was a servant of Virginia planter Hugh Gwyn, a wealthy landowner, justice, and member of the House of Burgesses, representing Charles River County (which became York County in 1642). #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nJohn Casor (c. 1625 - c. 1670) (surname recorded as Cazara and Corsala), a servant in Northampton County in the Virginia Colony, 1655 became the first person of African descent in the Thirteen Colonies to be declared enslaved for life as a result of a civil suit. In an earlier case, John Punch was the first man documented as enslaved in the Virginia Colony, sentenced to life in servitude for attempting to escape his captors. He argued that he was an indentured servant who had been forced by Anthony Johnson, a free African American man, to serve past his term; he was freed and went to work for Robert Parker as an indentured servant. Johnson sued Parker for his services. In ordering him returned to his master, Johnson, for life, the court both declared him enslaved and sustained the right of free African American people to own slaves. Laws racializing slavery hardened during his lifetime. In 1662, the Virginia Colony passed a law incorporating the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, ruling that children of enslaved mothers would be born into slavery, regardless of their father’s race or status. This was in contradiction to English common law for English subjects, which based a child’s status on that of the father. In 1699 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law deporting all free African American people. However many new families of free African American people continued to be formed during the colonial years by the close relationships among the working class. He said that he had been imported as a “seven or eight years” indentured servant and that, after attempting to reclaim his indenture, he had been told by Johnson that he didn’t have one. According to the civil court documents, he demanded his freedom. “Anthony Johnson was in a fire. Upon this, his son-in-law, his wife, and his two sons persuaded the said Anthony Johnson to set the said John Casor free.” He went to work for Robert Parker, an English colonist who, along with his brother George, testified that they knew he had an indenture. One commentator said that Johnson may have feared losing his headlights land if the case went to court. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\nAnthony Johnson (c. 1600 – 1670) was an Angolan known for achieving wealth in the early 17th-century Colony of Virginia. He was one of the first African Americans whose right to own property was recognized by the Virginia courts. Held as an indentured servant in 1621, he earned his freedom after several years and was granted land by the colony. He became a tobacco farmer in Maryland. He attained great wealth after completing his term as an indentured servant, and has been referred to as “’ the Black patriarch’ of the first community of Negro property owners in America”. In the early 1620s, slave traders captured the man who would be known as Anthony Johnson in Portuguese Angola, named him Antonio, and sold him into the Atlantic slave trade. He was bought by a colonist in Virginia. As an indentured servant, he worked for a merchant at the Virginia Company. He was Catholic. He sailed to Virginia in 1621 aboard the James. The Virginia Muster of 1624 lists his name as “Antonio not given,” recorded as “a Negro” in the “notes” column. He was sold as an indentured servant to a white planter named Bennet. Such workers worked under a limited indenture contract for four to seven years to pay off their passage, room, board, lodging, and freedom dues. Most Africans in the Thirteen Colonies were held under such contracts of limited indentured servitude. Except for those indentured for life, they were released after a contracted period. Those who managed to survive their period of indenture would receive land and equipment after their contracts expired or were bought out. He almost lost his life in the Indian massacre of 1622, when Bennet’s plantation was attacked. The Powhatans, who were the indigenous people dominant at that time in the Tidewater region of Virginia, were attempting to evict the colonists. They raided the settlement where he worked on Good Friday and killed 52 of the 57 men present. In 1623, a Black woman named Mary arrived aboard the ship Margaret. She was brought to work on the same plantation as he, where she was the only woman present. He and Mary married and lived together for more than forty years. #africanhistory365 #africanexcellence\n\n“Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long. Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love, for they are from of old. Do not remember the sins of my youth and my rebellious ways; according to your love remember me, for you, Lord, are good.” Psalm 25:4-7 NIV “Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” Colossians 3:13 NIV Everyone has sinned, sins, and will sin, has operated in misunderstanding and can forgive and love. Everyone has offended somebody and has been forgiven for an offense they have committed. As God has forgiven you based on your offenses, be gracious to forgive others. It is important to forgive yourself in the process. Forgiveness does not mean you forget, it means when you remember the offense, you can find joy and peace as opposed to hate and anger. Stop giving unforgiveness power in your life, it has no place. A daily prayer. Seek the Lord for your purpose as you rise and as you end your day. Understand he is merciful, forgiving, and the creator of love. Repentance is the key and God will deliver you from all rebellious ways, habits, and lifestyles. Try God! Seek God FIRST, study His Word, pray, praise, worship, repent, listen, celebrate, meditate, observe, believe, ask, surrender, fellowship, forgive, give, and be grateful and obedient."
