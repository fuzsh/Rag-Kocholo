        "text": "I wonder when will Maria announce the lake for Malcolm now.\n\nAnd bin all the other African-Americans of Genoa City.\n\nI read about this a couple weeks back, cause she made some statement to Perez Hilton. I didn't post it here because I wasn't sure if it would just get closed for being to \"gossipy\".\n\nI wonder if this means he'll be let go at Y&R?\n\nThey can work this into a story with Victor, I'm sure. Katherine can show up to tell Nikki that belt marks are just like love bites.\n\nIm sick of seeing this sl-t. I wish she'd go away. I heard about this a few weeks ago. Dont know what to beleieve but I dont care. Both of them are messy\n\nLook on the bright side: if things don't work out with the new husband, Hunter Tylo's got one waiting for her right across the warehouse. And he loves discipline with belts!\n\nI agree.... not surprising at all, This just another added bonus to all the behind the scenes drama on Y&R. (which of course is better than the actual show)\n\nThis is old news. Before they got married she said the same things and he said she was crazy but he still married her. I think there's some truth to it but it's probably from both sides. Seems like there are drugs involved, btu thats just my opinion."
