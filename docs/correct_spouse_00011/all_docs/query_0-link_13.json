        "text": "Darius McCrary, who played Eddie Winslow on the ’90s sitcom “Family Matters,” has been accused of a variety of abusive behavior including holding his infant daughter over a pot of boiling water.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by TMZ, McCrary’s wife, Tammy Brawner, made several claims against the actor, saying he “is violent, destructive and unstable emotionally.”\n\nBrawner wrote in the court docs filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court Feb. 15 that McCrary “uses drugs and drinks heavily on a regular basis.”\n\nBrawner, who has a temporary restraining order against McCrary, according to The Wrap, also said the actor threw a cellphone at her when she was eight months pregnant with their daughter Zoey, who was born in September 2015, after she attempted to leave him.\n\nPerhaps Brawner’s most shocking claim against McCrary is that during one incident, she says he “held [our daughter] over a hot stove with fire going and boiling water going.” She alleged McCrary told her he did not like their daughter “and that he wish[ed] he didn’t have her.” The incident reportedly occurred when Zoey was “no more than eight or nine months old.”\n\nA rep for McCrary did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.\n\nHis lawyer told TMZ Brawner “is a predator motivated by a desperate desire to extort money out of Mr. McCrary while trying to create an advantage in an impending divorce and custody battle.”\n\nBrawner fired back on social media, posting a picture of their daughter on Instagram.\n\n“I have no reason to lie on ANYONE about ANYTHING. And trust and believe, I DID NOT contact the media. I haven’t posted ONE thing about these matters on social media as I’ve tried to handle it privately and gracefully. However, these documents, unfortunately, are public record and were obviously attained,” she wrote. “I have a duty to protect her and myself. #MuchLove #ZoeysMom.”\n\nBrawner is a former Harlem Globetrotter. McCrary was previously married to Juliette M. Vann from 2005 to 2006 and Karrine Steffans from 2009 to 2011."
