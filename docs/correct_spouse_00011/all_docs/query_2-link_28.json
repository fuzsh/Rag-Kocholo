        "text": "Photo Courtesy of ABC\n\nThe series follows the fortunes of the Winslows, a middle-class, African-American family living in Chicago, Illinois and their nerdy next-door neighbour Steve Urkel (Jaleel White).\n\nCarl Winslow (Reginald VelJohnson) – Carl is the head of the Winslow family, or “Big Kahuna” as he prefers to be called. Maybe he should have thought of a better name: when it comes to arguments with his wife, Harriette, (Jo Marie Payton) Carl usually ends up on the losing side. He is a dedicated and capable officer in the Chicago Police Department, and has three biological children: Eddie (Darius McCrary), Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams) and Judy (Jaimee Foxworth). Later, the household grows when he and his wife adopt a son named 3J (Orlando Brown). 3J’s mother, Estelle, (Rosetta LeNoire) also lives with the Winslows, as does Carl’s sister-in-law Rachel, (Telma Hopkins) and her son, Richie (Bryton McClure). Carl’s love of junk food means he’s carrying some extra weight. He’s constantly annoyed by his next-door neighbor, Steve Urkel, but annoyed or not he’s there for Steve when he needs him. He’s a decent, hard-working man and loves his family deeply.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\nHarriette Winslow (Jo Marie Payton) – Harriette is Carl’s wife, a strong-willed woman and a conservative. She’s proud to be a working woman and mother, and puts everything into both her roles. The kind of woman who tells it like it is, Harriette also tries her best to give constructive advice. Her favorite catchphrase is “Carl!”\n\nEddie Winslow (Darius McCrary) – Eddie is the only biological son of Carl and Harriette, as well as the oldest of their offspring. A rebel without a cause, he gets into trouble at high school and often balks at his father’s strict rules. He romances a string girlfriends through the series, though as time goes by he begins to show more interest in finding a serious relationship. He is a fan of the NFL and the NBA, and has at times had a serious problem with gambling.\n\nLaura Winslow (Kellie Shanygne Williams) – Laura is Carl and Harriette’s eldest daughter and the unfortunate focus of Steve Urkel’s unwavering affection. Unlike her older brother, Laura is well-behaved and gets great grades. Popular and hardworking, her only problems are caused by her determination to do everything by herself and the fact that she’s not always a great judge of character, especially when it comes to her boyfriends.\n\nJudy Winslow (Jaimee Foxworth) – Judy is the youngest child of Harriette and Carl, though during the fifth season she disappears without explanation. She is Miss Average – perhaps why she disappeared! – and seems to be close to her older sister, Laura.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\nSteve Urkel (Jaleel White) – Steve is the nerdy, annoying, next-door neighbor of the Winslow family. As overbearing as he is intelligent, Steve doesn’t seem to care if he irritates people. Nevertheless he’s kind and helpful and cares for all the Winslows, fondly referring to Carl as “Big Guy”. Besotted with Laura, Steve is constantly trying to win her love. He might seem unlikely to succeed but inventor Steve has lots of plans – like the machine that will turn him into his cool, handsome alter ego, Stefan Urquelle!\n\nEstelle Winslow (Rosetta LeNoire) – Estelle is mother to Carl and his four brothers. Wise Estelle is fiercely protective of all her grandchildren – and that includes Steve Urkel, whom she looks on as a grandson. Urkel calls her “Estelle, my Belle” and she loves his company, trying to get him to stay even while everyone else is trying to persuade him to go! Her catchphrase when Carl does something she doesn’t like is, “Way to go, Carl”. Despite her age, Estelle is the queen of pop culture with a finger on the button of all the latest trends.\n\nRachel Baines-Crawford (Telma Hopkins) – Rachel is the widowed younger sister of Harriette. She and her young son, Richie, move in with her sister’s family shortly after her the death of her husband, Robert. Creative Rachel loves singing and writing and is something of an entrepreneur, opening a hangout for teenagers called, “Rachel’s Place”. Her trademark is her array of unusual hats.\n\nRichie Crawford (Bryton McClure) – Richie is the son of Rachel and her deceased husband. He died before ever getting to see his son, so after Richie and his mother move into the Winslow home, Carl fills the role of “father”. As Richie gets older, he comes to idolize his “Uncle Steve”. Later in the series he befriends an orphan named 3J, who is then adopted by Harriette and Carl.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\n3J (Jerry Jamal) Jameson – 3J is Richie’s friend, an orphan with a smart-mouth and a chip on his shoulder that hides the fact that all he wants is a family who’ll love him. His mother gave him up for adoption when he was born, and he lived with his aunt until she could no longer afford to keep him and he was placed in a children’s shelter. Carl and Harriette adopt him, realizing that he just needs love and security.\n\nMyra Monkhouse (Michelle Thomas) – Pretty Myra is into polka music and nerdy boys. She can be quite persistent when she wants something – and Steve is one of those things! He agrees to date her on the condition that he can stay friends with Laura, and though Myra sometimes feels she’s competing with Laura, she agrees. When she and Steve start going steady, Myra begins to mellow as she becomes more secure.\n\nWaldo Faldo (Steve Harrison) – Waldo was once a friend of Willie Fuffner, a notorious bully, but is now friends with Eddiie Winslow and Steve Urkel. Waldo isn’t the sharpest tool in the box, but he has sound morals. He has a sister with the unfortunate name of Quesadilla, and dates Laura’s best friend Maxine.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\nMain Cast\n\nCharacter Actor Carl Winslow Reginald VelJohnson Harriette Winslow Jo Marie Payton and Judyann Elder Eddie Winslow Darius McCrary Laura Winslow Kellie Shanygne Williams Steve Urkel Jaleel White Estelle Winslow Rosetta Noire Rachel Baines-Crawford Telma Hopkins Judy Winslow Jaimee Foxworth and Valerie Jones Richie Crawford Bryton McClure (a.k.a.

She was then a member of an acting troupe led by Jones’s father.\n\nJo Marie Payton (Harriette Winslow) decided to leave the show when it moved from ABC to CBS, in part because she did not like how the series had expanded the Steve Urkel character and storylines.

He was so popular that an entire range of merchandise was spawned including trading cards, books, a talking doll, posters, lunch boxes, T-shirts and even a limited edition cereal.\n\nKellie Shanygne Williams (Laura Winslow) did not talk when she was a toddler, so her father decided to put her into a theater program.

She was 90 years old.\n\nJaleel White enjoys writing short stories, drawing cartoons and making ice cream.\n\nIn 2002, Jaimee Foxworth (Judy Winslow) made headlines when it came out that she had been making porn films under the name of “Crave”.\n\nAt nine seasons, Family Matters is the second longest-running series with a mostly African-American cast.

Bryton James) (Richie Crawford) received the Michael Landon Award for charitable work through youth in entertainment.\n\nTelma Hopkins volunteers a lot of time to various charitable causes.\n\nThe last season of the series was broadcast on CBS instead of ABC, as CBS picked up not only Family Matters, but Step by Step in a $40 million dollar deal.

His father, Dr. Michael White, a dentist, gave him the pair of glasses that he used while at work to keep particles out of his eyes. White figured that if he got the role, he would find another pair later. However, everyone loved the look so much he ended up keeping his father’s glasses permanently.\n\nJo Marie Payton graduated from Albany State University.\n\nRosetta LeNoire had rickets as a child and had to wear leg braces for thirteen years.

They also shared the same tutor on set.\n\nJaleel White (Steve Urkel) played a total of eight different characters on the show.\n\nReginald VelJohnson received a Bachelor of Arts degree from New York University.\n\nFamily Matters had crossovers with several other TGIF shows including Perfect Strangers, Full House, Boy Meets World, Step by Step and Meego. Most had something to do with the character of Steve Urkel.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\nAs well as being an actor, Darius McCrary is a music producer and songwriter.\n\nKellie Shanygne Williams has two children, one son and one daughter.\n\nRosetta LeNoire’s mother died at the age of 27 after giving birth to LeNoire’s brother in a hospital corridor in Harlem. The horrific tragedy occurred as a result of segregationist police keeping her from using a room.\n\nAfter Jaleel White shot his very first scene as Steve Urkel, he received an unusual reaction. In the audience were fifty frat boys who immediately started chanting, “Urkel! Urkel! Urkel!” It was at that moment that the show’s producers realized just what a talent he was.\n\nAs the series continued on, Jaleel White was growing into an adult, making it difficult to retain his character’s younger appearance. Because of this, he had to avoid lifting weights and shave daily.\n\nMichelle Thomas (Myra Monkhouse) became ill with stomach cancer and left the series shortly before it was cancelled. Tragically, she died that same year.

The reasons were twofold: she was contributing little to the show and the actress playing her, Jaimee Foxworth, had asked for a pay rise. Later, the show’s history was revised so that the character had never existed.\n\nKellie Shanygne Williams has moved back to her hometown of Washington D.C.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of ABC\n\nMichelle Thomas played the girlfriend of Theo Huxtable (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) on The Cosby Show.\n\nBryton McClure enjoys snowboarding, playing video games and racing go-karts.\n\nJaleel White has one child, a daughter.\n\nDarius McCrary’s first marriage was to a Las Vegas showgirl named Juliette.
