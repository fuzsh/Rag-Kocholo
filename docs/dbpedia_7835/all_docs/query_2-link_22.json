        "text": "Africa, the second-largestÂ continent , is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is divided in half almost equally by theÂ Equator.\n\nAfrica has eight major physical regions : the Sahara, theÂ Sahel, the Ethiopian Highlands, savannas, the Swahili Coast, rainforests, the African Great Lakes, and Southern Africa. Some of these regions cover large bands of the continent, such as the Sahara and the Sahel, while others are isolated areas, such as the Ethiopian Highlands and the Great Lakes. Each of these regions has unique animal, plant, and human communities.\n\nSahara\n\nThe Sahara is the worldâs largest hotÂ desert. It covers 8.5 million square kilometers (about 3.3 million square miles), making it about the size of Brazil. This desert region makes up 25 percent of Africa and defines the continentâs northern bulge.\n\nThe Sahara has a number of distinct physical features, including ergs, regs, hamadas, and oases.Â Ergs, which cover 20 percent of the Sahara, areÂ sand dunes that stretch for hundreds of kilometers and reach heights of more than 300 meters (1,000 feet). Ergs cover most of Algeria and Libya as well as parts of Mali and Nigeria. These ergs can contain large quantities ofÂ salt, which is harvested and sold forÂ industrialÂ and food use. People of the Sahara have been producing salt for thousands of years by creating pits and filling them with water to leach out the salt. The water is then heated to a boil; as it evaporates, the salt is left behind. Salt production remains is a major industry and job source in this part of Africa.\n\nRegs, which make up 70 percent of the Sahara, are plains of sand andÂ gravel. The gravel can be black, red, or white. Regs are the remains ofÂ prehistoric seabeds and riverbeds , though they are now nearly waterless.\n\nHamadas are elevatedÂ plateaus of rock and stone. They include the Atlas Mountains, which stretch from southwestern Morocco to northeastern Tunisia; the Tibesti Mountains of southern Libya and northern Chad; and the Ahaggar Mountains in southern Algeria.\n\nAnÂ oasisÂ is a hub of water in the desert, often in the form ofÂ springs , wells, orÂ irrigationÂ systems. There are over 90 oases throughout the Sahara Desert, and many of them have enough water and other resources to support human life. People of various cultures and traditions have been living in and around these oases since the sixth century B.C.E.\n\nAnimal and plant communities have also adapted to the regionâs extremely dry conditions. TheÂ kidneys of the jerboa, a type of rodent, produce highly concentrated urine that minimizes water loss. AÂ dromedary camelÂ conserves water by changing its body temperature so it does not sweat as the day gets hotter. The scorpion limits its activities to night, burrowing into the cooler sands beneath the surface during the day. It also absorbs water from the flesh of itsÂ prey.\n\nSaharan plants, meanwhile, survive thanks to root systems that plunge deep into the ground. In parts of the Sahara, however, plants cannot take root at all.\n\nSahel\n\nThe Sahel is a narrow band of semi-aridÂ land that forms aÂ transition zone between the Sahara to the north and the savannas to the south. It is made up of flat, barren Â plains that stretch roughly 5,400 kilometers (3,300 miles) across Africa, from Senegal to Sudan.\n\nThe Sahel contains theÂ fertileÂ deltaÂ of the Niger, one of Africaâs longest rivers. The Sahelâs fertile land is rapidly becoming desert as a result ofÂ drought,Â deforestation , and intensiveÂ agriculture. This process is known asÂ desertification.Â Desertification is occurring in the Sahel for a variety of reasons, with the increasing temperatures associated with climate change being a primary contributing factor. Other causes include economic factors, such as cattle raising. While the practice is encouraged by several national governments in the region as a way to combat poverty, years of overgrazing has caused the quality of the soil to decline, expanding the size of the desert. Additionally, the area near the Sahel has been plagued by political unrest and armed conflict between ethnic and tribal groups, which has made it challenging for local governments and international donors alike to prioritize and support conservation efforts. International organizations and governments are often reluctant to provide aid to countries to combat desertification, because they worry that the funds may be diverted to other causes or used to fuel further political instability.\n\nSahel animals have adaptations that help them scavenge for scarce water and vegetation resources. The Senegal gerbilâthe most common mammal in the Sahelâmeasures only a few centimeters but consumes as much as 10 percent of the Sahelâs plants.\n\nThe Sahelâs green vegetation emerges only during the rainy season, and farmers must work quickly to take advantage of the short growing season. Sahel farmers grow cotton, nuts, and grains. Among the most common trees found in the Sahel are baobabs , a type of drought- and fire-resistant tree that can grow to be as tall as 26 meters (85 feet) with trunks that are often 15 meters (50 feet) wide, and acacia, whose deep root systems are ideal for semi-arid climates. Cram-cram, a prickly grass, is the primaryÂ fodderÂ for Sahel herds such as zebuÂ cattle.\n\nEthiopian Highlands\n\nThe Ethiopian Highlands began to rise 75 million years ago, asÂ magmaÂ from the Earthâs mantle uplifted a broadÂ domeÂ ofÂ ancientÂ rock. This dome was later split as Africaâs continental crust pulled apart, creating the Great Rift Valley system. Today, this valley cuts through the Ethiopian Highlands from the southwest to the northeast. The Ethiopian Highlands are home to 80 percent of Africaâs tallest mountains.\n\nThe highlandâsÂ craggyÂ landscapeÂ is perfect forÂ nimbleÂ animal species. Native species, such as the walia ibex, anÂ endangered wild goat, and the gelada baboon, live in the ledges and rocky outposts of the Simien Mountains. The mostÂ emblematicÂ highland species is the Ethiopian wolf. Found only in Ethiopia, this wolf is a rare predator and unique part of the Ethiopian Highland ecosystem. The encroachment of humans on the wolvesâ habitat has caused them to become endangered , and despite their endangered status, farmers sometimes hunt the wolves to protect their livestock. Ethiopian wolves also are susceptible to rabies and other diseases that can be passed to humans, making advocacy for their protection even more challenging.\n\nPlant species native to the Ethiopian Highlands include the Ethiopian rose (Africaâs only native rose) and the ensete, a tall, thick, rubbery plant that is a close relative of the banana.\n\nSavannas\n\nSavannas, orÂ grasslands, cover more than 13 million square kilometers (5 million square miles), comprising almost half of Africa. These grasslands make up most of central Africa, beginning south of the Sahara and the Sahel and ending north of the continentâs southern tip.\n\nAmong Africaâs savanna regions, the Serengeti Plains is the best known. The Serengeti is a vast, undulating plain that stretches 30,000 square kilometers (11,583 square miles) from Kenyaâs Massai-MaraÂ game reserveÂ to Tanzaniaâs Serengeti National Park.\n\nThe Serengeti is home to one of the continentâs highest concentrations of large mammal species, including lions, hyenas, zebras, giraffes, and elephants. Each year, more than one million wildebeest travel in a circularÂ migration, following seasonal rains, across the Serengeti Plains. Their grazing and trampling of grass allows new grasses to grow, while their waste helps fertilize the soil.\n\nResidents of savanna regions have been capitalizing on the unique wildlife to support the economy through ecotourism . However, people in the savannas are facing similar challenges to those in the Sahel, as economic pressure to increase agricultural output is driving loss of savanna lands.\n\nSwahili Coast\n\nThe Swahili Coast stretches about 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) along the coastlines of Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The nearbyÂ coral reefs andÂ barrier islands protect the coast from severe weather.Â For centuries, the areas along the Swahili Coast, such as the island of Kilwa Kisiwani off the coast of Tanzania, have been centers for trade and water travel. This tradition has continued as the people of the Swahili Coast have built several major international ports, including Dar es Salaam and Mombasa.\n\nThere is not a lot of animal life on the sandy Swahili Coast. The golden-rumped elephant shrew, an insect-eating rodent with a longÂ snout, is common. A smallÂ species of primate known as the bush baby or galago inhabits vegetated areas of the Swahili Coast. Bush babies feed primarily on insects, fruit, and leaves. Their distinctive enormous eyes allow them to hunt at night.\n\nThe vegetated areas of the Swahili Coast are located on a narrow strip just inland from the coastal sands. MangroveÂ forests are the most common vegetation. Mangroves have exposed root systems, which allow the trees to absorb oxygen directly from the air, as well as from theÂ nutrient-poor soil.\n\nRainforest\n\nAfricaâs rainforests have a rich variety of animal life; a 6-kilometer (4-mile) patch could contain up to 400 bird species, 150 butterfly species, and 60 amphibian species. Important mammals include African forest elephants, gorillas, the black colobus monkey, and the okapi, a donkey-like giraffe.\n\nThe driver ant is one of Africaâs most aggressive rainforest species. Driver ants move across the rainforest floor in columns of up to 20 million and will eat anything from toxic millipedes to small reptiles and mammals.\n\nThe African rainforestâs plant community is even more diverse, with an estimated 8,000 plant species documented. More than 1,100 of these species are endemic, meaning they are found nowhere else on Earth. Only 10 percent of the plants in the African rainforest have been identified.\n\nSeveral nomadic indigenous rainforest groups have lived off the forestâs resources for centuries, including the Mbuti, the Twa, the Baka, and the Aka (with the latter two sometimes being grouped together). These tribes have historically had little contact with the outside world, but as rural populations just beyond the rainforest have continued to grow and encroach on these areas, their traditional way of life has begun to face serious threat.\n\nAfrican Great Lakes\n\nThe Great Lakes are located in ten countries that surround the Great Rift Valley: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. As the African continent separated from Saudi Arabia, large, deep cracks were created in the Earthâs surface. These cracks were later filled with water. This geologic process created some of the largest and deepestÂ lakes in the world.\n\nThere are seven major African Great Lakes: Lake Albert, Lake Edward, Lake Kivu, Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Turkana, and Lake Victoria. Lake Victoria, the largest lake in Africa, is the southern source of the Nile River, the longest river in the world. Due to the water resources, local governments in Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania, as well other countries, are working to build more hydroelectric power plants to harness the potential energy.\n\nThe African Great Lakes region has a diverse range ofÂ aquatic Â andÂ terrestrial animal life. Fish include the Nile perch, which can weigh as much as 45 kilograms (100 pounds) or more. There are also fish as small as the 2.5-centimeter (1-inch) cichlid. Migrating savanna animals, such as wildebeest, use the lakes asÂ watering holes. Hippos and crocodiles also call the region their home.\n\nThe Great Lakes border everything from rainforest to savanna plant communities. However, invasive speciesÂ like the water hyacinth and papyrus have begun to take over entire shorelines, endangering animals and plants."
