        "text": "Niger is an impovrished landlocked country in the Western Sahel with an overwhelmingly rural population. The authority of the state is challenged in many parts of the country: in some remote, rural areas, the state has a very limited presence. This leaves customary governance actors as the only existing rule of law and provider of public goods.\n\nNiger faces a security crisis along its borders with Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali. Violent armed groups continue to attack security forces and civilians, which has led to states of emergency being announced or extended in various regions of the country. The situation deteriorated in 2022, giving rise to new concerns such as the increase in cattle thefts and kidnappings in the communes of Gabi and Guidan sori. A special military operation ‘Faraoutar Bishiya’ was deployed in these areas. Despite these challenges, Niger has a lengthy history of dialogue as demonstrated by its effective management of Tuareg uprisings in the past. The nation has worked to institutionalize dialogue-base approaches with the view to addressing security issues in a more comprehensive manner. In 2022 the government intra- and intercommunal conversations for peace, reconciliation, and social cohesion in various regions to prevent recruiting by terrorist organizations."
