        "text": "AÂ continentÂ is one of Earthâs seven main divisions of land. The continents are, from largest to smallest: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.\n\nWhenÂ geographers identify a continent, they usually include all theÂ islands associated with it. Japan, for instance, is part of the continent of Asia. Greenland and all the islands in the Caribbean Sea are usually considered part of North America.\n\nTogether, the continents add up to about 148 million square kilometers (57 million square miles) of land. Continents make up mostâbut not allâof Earthâs land surface. A very small portion of the total land area is made up of islands that are not considered physical parts of continents. TheÂ ocean covers almost three-fourths of Earth. The area of the ocean is more than double the area of all the continents combined. All continents border at least one ocean. Asia, the largest continent, has the longest series ofÂ coastlines.\n\nCoastlines, however, do notÂ indicateÂ the actual boundaries of the continents. Continents are defined by their continental shelves. AÂ continental shelfÂ is a gently sloping area that extends outward from theÂ beachÂ far into the ocean. A continental shelf is part of the ocean, but also part of the continent.\n\nTo geographers, continents are also culturally distinct. The continents of Europe and Asia, for example, are actually part of a single,Â enormousÂ piece of land called Eurasia. ButÂ linguistically and ethnically, the areas of Asia and Europe are distinct. Because of this, most geographers divide Eurasia into Europe and Asia. An imaginary line, running from the northern Ural Mountains in Russia south to the Caspian and Black Seas, separates Europe, to the west, from Asia, to the east.\n\nBuilding the Continents\n\nEarth formed 4.6 billion years ago from a great, swirling cloud ofÂ dustÂ andÂ gas. The continuous smashing of spaceÂ debrisÂ and the pull ofÂ gravityÂ made Earth's core heat up. As the heat increased, some of Earthâs rocky materials melted and rose to the surface, where they cooled and formed a crust. Heavier material sank toward Earthâs center. Eventually, Earth came to have three main layers: theÂ core, theÂ mantle, and theÂ crust.\n\nThe crust and the top portion of the mantle form aÂ rigidÂ shell around Earth that is broken up into huge sections calledÂ tectonic plates. The heat from inside Earth causes the plates to slide around on theÂ moltenÂ mantle. Today, tectonic plates continue to slowly slide around the surface, just as they have been doing for hundreds of millions of years.Â Geologists believe the interaction of the plates, a process calledÂ plate tectonics, contributed to the creation of continents.\n\nStudies of rocks found inÂ ancientÂ areas of North America have revealed the oldest known pieces of the continents began to form nearly four billion years ago, soon after Earth itself formed. At that time, aÂ primitiveÂ ocean covered Earth. Only a small fraction of the crust was made up of continental material. ScientistsÂ theorizeÂ that this material built up along the boundaries of tectonic plates during a process calledÂ subduction. During subduction, plates collide, and the edge of one plate slides beneath the edge of another.\n\nWhen heavyÂ oceanic crustÂ subducted toward the mantle, it melted in the mantleâs intense heat. Once melted, the rock became lighter. CalledÂ magma, it rose through the overlying plate and burst out asÂ lava. When the lava cooled, it hardened intoÂ igneous rock.\n\nGradually, the igneous rock built up into smallÂ volcanic islands above the surface of the ocean. Over time, these islands grew bigger, partly as the result of more lava flows and partly from the buildup of material scraped off descending plates. When plates carrying islands subducted, the islands themselves did not descend into the mantle. Their materialÂ fused with that of islands on the neighboring plate. This made even larger landmassesâthe first continents.\n\nThe building of volcanic islands and continental material through plate tectonics is a process that continues today.Â Continental crustÂ is much lighter than oceanic crust. InÂ subduction zones, where tectonic plates interact with each other, oceanic crust always subducts beneath continental crust. Oceanic crust is constantly being recycled in the mantle. For this reason, continental crust is much, much older than oceanic crust.\n\nWandering Continents\n\nIf you could visit Earth as it was millions of years ago, it would look very different. The continents have not always been where they are today. About 480 million years ago, most continents were scattered chunks of land lying along or south of theÂ Equator. Millions of years of continuous tectonic activity changed their positions, and by 240 million years ago, almost all of the worldâs land was joined in a single, huge continent. Geologists call thisÂ supercontinent Pangaea, which means âall landsâ in Greek.\n\nBy about 200 million years ago, the forces that helped form Pangaea caused the supercontinent to begin to break apart. The pieces of Pangaea that began to move apart were the beginnings of the continents that we know today.\n\nA giant landmass that would become Europe, Asia, and North America separated from another mass that would split up into other continents and regions. In time, Antarctica and Oceania, still joined together, broke away and drifted south. The small piece of land that would become theÂ peninsulaÂ of India broke away and for millions of years moved north as a large island. It eventually collided with Asia. Gradually, the different landmasses moved to their present locations.\n\nThe positions of the continents are always changing. North America and Europe are moving away from each other at the rate of about 2.5 centimeters (one inch) per year. If you could visit the planet in the future, you might find that part of the United States' state of California had separated from North America and become an island. Africa might have split in two along the Great RiftÂ Valley. It is even possible that another supercontinent may form someday.\n\nContinental Features\n\nThe surface of the continents has changed many times because of mountain building,Â weathering,Â erosion, and build-up ofÂ sediment. Continuous, slow movement of tectonic plates also changes surface features.\n\nThe rocks that form the continents have been shaped and reshaped many times. GreatÂ mountain ranges have risen and then have been worn away. Ocean waters haveÂ flooded huge areas and then gradually dried up. MassiveÂ ice sheets have come and gone, sculpting the landscape in the process.\n\nToday, all continents have great mountain ranges,Â vastÂ plains,Â extensiveÂ plateaus, andÂ complexÂ river systems. The landmassesâs averageÂ elevationÂ aboveÂ sea levelÂ is about 838 meters (2,750 feet).\n\nAlthough each isÂ unique, all the continents share two basic features: old, geologicallyÂ stableÂ regions, and younger, somewhat more activeÂ regions. In the younger regions, the process of mountain building has happened recently and often continues to happen.\n\nThe power for mountain building, orÂ orogeny, comes from plate tectonics. One way mountains form is through the collision of two tectonic plates. The impact creates wrinkles in the crust, just as a rug wrinkles when you push against one end of it. Such a collision created Asiaâs Himalaya several million years ago. The plate carrying India slowly and forcefully shoved the landmass of India into Asia, which was riding on another plate. The collision continues today, causing the Himalaya to grow taller every year.\n\nRecently formed mountains, calledÂ coastal ranges, rise near the western coasts of North America and South America. Older, more stable mountain ranges are found in the interior of continents. The Appalachians of North America and the Urals, on the border between Europe and Asia, are older mountain ranges that are not geologically active.\n\nEven older than these ancient, eroded mountain ranges are flatter, more stable areas of the continents calledÂ cratons. A craton is an area of ancient crust that formed during Earthâs early history. Every continent has a craton. Microcontinents, like New Zealand, lack cratons.\n\nCratons have two forms:Â shields andÂ platforms. Shields are bare rocks that may be the roots or cores of ancient mountain ranges that have completely eroded away. Platforms are cratons with sediment andÂ sedimentary rockÂ lying on top.\n\nThe Canadian Shield makes up about a quarter of North America. For hundreds of thousands of years, sheets of ice up to 3.2 kilometers (two miles) thick coated the Canadian Shield. The moving ice wore away material on top of ancient rock layers, exposing some of the oldest formations on Earth. When you stand on the oldest part of the Canadian Shield, you stand directly on rocks that formed more than 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nNorth America\n\nNorth America, the third-largest continent, extends from the tiny Aleutian Islands in the northwest to theÂ IsthmusÂ of Panama in the south. The continent includes the enormous island of Greenland in the northeast. In the far north, the continent stretches halfway around the world, from Greenland to the Aleutians. But at Panamaâs narrowest part, the continent is just 50 kilometers (31 miles) across.\n\nYoung mountainsâincluding the Rockies, North Americaâs largest chainârise in the West. Some of Earthâs youngest mountains are found in the Cascade Range of the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, and California. Some peaks there began to form only about one million years agoâa wink of an eye in Earthâs long history. North Americaâs older mountain ranges rise near the East Coast of the United States and Canada.\n\nIn between the mountain systems lie wide plains that contain deep, richÂ soil. Much of the soil was formed from material deposited during the most recentÂ glacial period. This Ice AgeÂ reached its peak about 18,000 years ago. AsÂ glaciers retreated, streams of melted ice dropped sediment on the land, building layers ofÂ fertileÂ soil in the plains region.Â GrainÂ grown in this region, called the âbreadbasket of North America,â feeds a large part of the world.\n\nNorth America contains a variety of natural wonders. Landforms and all types ofÂ vegetationÂ can be found within its boundaries. North America has deepÂ canyons, such as Copper Canyon in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Yellowstone National Park, in the U.S. state of Wyoming, has some of the worldâs most activeÂ geysers. Canadaâs Bay of Fundy has the greatest variation ofÂ tideÂ levels in the world. TheÂ Great LakesÂ form the planetâs largest area ofÂ freshwater. In California,Â giant sequoias, the worldâs most massive trees, grow more than 76 meters (250 feet) tall and nearly 31 meters (100 feet) around.\n\nGreenland, off the east coast of Canada, is the worldâs largest island. Despite its name, Greenland is mostly covered with ice. Its ice is aÂ remnantÂ of the great ice sheets that onceÂ blanketed much of the North American continent. Greenland is the only place besides Antarctica that still has an ice sheet.\n\nFrom the freezing Arctic to theÂ tropicalÂ jungles of Central America, North America enjoys moreÂ climateÂ variation than any other continent. Almost every type ofÂ ecosystemÂ is represented somewhere on the continent, fromÂ coral reefs in the Caribbean to Greenlandâs ice sheet to theÂ Great PlainsÂ in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nToday, North America is home to the citizens of Canada, the United States, Greenland (an autonomous terrirory of Denmark), Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and the island countries and territories that dot the Caribbean Sea and the western North Atlantic.\n\nMost of North America sits on the North American Plate. Parts of the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, and California sit on the tiny Juan de Fuca Plate. Parts of California and the Mexican state of Baja California sit on the enormous Pacific Plate. Parts of Baja California and the Mexican states of Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Jalisco sit on the Cocos Plate. The Caribbean Plate carries most of the small islands of the Caribbean Sea (south of the island of Cuba) as well as Central America from Honduras to Panama. The Hawaiian Islands, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on the Pacific Plate, are usually considered part of North America.\n\nSouth America\n\nSouth America is connected to North America by the narrow Isthmus of Panama. These two continents werenât always connected; they came together only three million years ago. South America is the fourth-largest continent and extends from the sunny beaches of the Caribbean Sea to theÂ frigidÂ waters near the Antarctic Circle.\n\nSouth Americaâs southernmost islands, calledÂ Tierra del Fuego, are less than 1,120 kilometers (700 miles) from Antarctica. These islands even host some Antarctic birds, such as penguins, albatrosses, and terns. Early SpanishÂ explorers visiting the islands for the first time saw small fires dotting the land. These fires, made byÂ IndigenousÂ people, seemed to float on the water, which is probably how the islands got their nameâTierra del Fuego means \"Land of Fire.\"\n\nThe Andes, Earthâs longestÂ terrestrial mountain range, stretch the entire length of South America. Many activeÂ volcanoes dot the range. These volcanic areas are fueled by heat generated as a large oceanic plate, called the Nazca Plate, grinds beneath the plate carrying South America.\n\nThe central-southern area of South America hasÂ pampas, or plains. These rich areas are ideal forÂ agriculture. The growing of wheat is a majorÂ industryÂ in the pampas.Â Grazing animals, such asÂ cattleÂ and sheep, are also raised in the pampas region.\n\nIn northern South America, the Amazon River and its tributaries flow through the worldâs largest tropicalÂ rainforest. In volume, the Amazon is the largest river in the world. More water flows from it than from the next six largest rivers combined.\n\nSouth America is also home to the worldâs highestÂ waterfall, Angel Falls, in the country of Venezuela. Water flows more than 979 meters (3,212 feet)âalmost one mile. The falls are so high that most of the waterÂ evaporates intoÂ mistÂ or is blown away by wind before it reaches the ground.\n\nSouth American rainforests contain an enormous wealth of animal and plant life. More than 15,000 species of plants and animals are found only in the AmazonÂ Basin. Many Amazonian plant species are sources of food andÂ medicineÂ for the rest of the world. Scientists are trying to find ways to preserve thisÂ preciousÂ andÂ fragileÂ environment as people move into the Amazon Basin and clear land for settlements and agriculture.\n\nTwelve independent countries make up South America: Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, and Suriname. The territories of French Guiana, which is claimed by France, and the Falkland Islands, which are adminstered by the United Kingdom but claimed by Argentina, are also part of South America.\n\nAlmost all of South America sits on top of the South American Plate.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope, the sixth-largest continent, contains just seven percent of the worldâs land. In total area, the continent of Europe is only slightly larger than the country of Canada. However, the population of Europe is more than twice that of South America. Europe has 46 countries and many of the worldâs major cities, including London, the United Kingdom; Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; Rome, Italy; Madrid, Spain; and Moscow, Russia.\n\nMost European countries have access to the ocean. The continent is bordered by the Arctic Ocean in the north, the Atlantic Ocean in the west, the Caspian Sea in the southeast, and the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the south. The nearness of these bodies of water and theÂ navigationÂ of many of Europeâs rivers played a major role in the continentâs history. Early Europeans learned the river systems of the Volga, Danube, Don, Rhine, and Po, and could successfully travel the length and width of the small continent forÂ trade,Â communication, orÂ conquest.\n\nNavigation and exploration outside of Europe was an important part of the development of the continentâsÂ economic, social, linguistic, and politicalÂ legacy. European explorers were responsible for colonizing land on every continent except Antarctica. This colonization process had aÂ drasticÂ impact on the economic and political development of those continents, as well as Europe. Europe's colonial period ended in the violent transfer of wealth and land from Indigenous peoples in the Americas, and later Africa, Oceania, and Asia.\n\nIn the east, the Ural Mountains separate Europe from Asia. The nations of Russia and KazakhstanÂ straddleÂ both continents. Another range, the KjÃ¸len Mountains, extends along the northern part of the border between Sweden and Norway. To the south, the Alps form anÂ arcÂ stretching from Albania to Austria, then across Switzerland and northern Italy into France. As the youngest and steepest of Europeâs mountains, the Alps geologically resemble the Rockies of North America, another young range.\n\nA large area of gently rolling plains extends from northern France eastward to the Urals. A climate of warm summers, cold winters, and plentiful rain helps make much of this EuropeanÂ farmlandÂ very productive.\n\nThe climate of Western Europe, especially around the Mediterranean Sea, makes it one of the worldâs leadingÂ tourismÂ destinations.\n\nAlmost all of Europe sits on the massive Eurasian Plate.\n\nAfrica\n\nAfrica, the second-largest continent, covers an area more than three times that of the United States. From north to south, Africa stretches about 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles). It is connected to Asia by the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt.\n\nThe Sahara, which covers much of North Africa, is the worldâs largest hotÂ desert. The worldâs longest river, the Nile, flows more than 6,560 kilometers (4,100 miles) from its mostÂ remoteÂ headwaters in Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean Sea in the north. A series of falls andÂ rapidsÂ along the southern part of the river makes navigation difficult. The Nile has played an important role in the history of Africa. In ancient EgyptianÂ civilization, it was a source of life forÂ food, water, and transportation.\n\nThe top half of Africa is mostly dry, hot desert. The middle area hasÂ savannas, or flat, grassy plains. This region is home to wild animals such as lions, giraffes, elephants, hyenas, cheetahs, and wildebeests. The central and southern areas of Africa areÂ dominated by rainforests. Many of these forests thrive around Africaâs other great rivers, the Zambezi, the Congo, and the Niger. These rivers also served as the homes to Great Zimbabwe, the Kingdom of Kongo, and the Ghana Empire, respectively. However, trees are being cut down in Africaâs rainforests for many of the same reasonsÂ deforestationÂ is taking place in the rainforests of South America and Asia:Â developmentÂ for businesses, homes, and agriculture.\n\nMuch of Africa is a high plateau surrounded by narrow strips of coastal lowlands. Hilly uplands and mountains rise in some areas of the interior. Glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania sit just kilometers from the tropical jungles below. Even though Kilimanjaro is not far from the Equator,Â snowÂ covers its summit all year long.\n\nIn eastern Africa, a giant depression called the Great Rift Valley runs from the Red Sea to the country of Mozambique. (TheÂ rift valleyÂ actually starts in southwestern Asia.) The Great Rift Valley is a site of major tectonic activity, where the continent of Africa is splitting into two. Geologists have already named the two parts of the African Plate. The Nubian Plate will carry most of the continent, to the west of the rift; the Somali Plate will carry the far eastern part of the continent, including the so-called âHorn of Africa.â The Horn of Africa is a peninsula that resembles the upturned horn of a rhinoceros. The countries of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Somalia sit on the Horn of Africa and the Somali Plate.\n\nAfrica is home to 54 countries but only 16 percent of the worldâs total population. The area of central-eastern Africa is important to scientists who studyÂ evolutionÂ and the earliest origins of humanity. This area is thought to be the place whereÂ hominids began to evolve.\n\nThe entire continent of Africa sits on the African Plate.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia, the largest continent, stretches from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the western Pacific Ocean. There are more than 40 countries in Asia. Some are among the most-populated countries in the world, including China, India, and Indonesia. Sixty percent of Earthâs population lives in Asia. More than a third of the worldâs people live in China and India alone.\n\nThe continent of Asia includes many islands, some of them are countries unto themselves. The Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, and Taiwan are major island nations in Asia.\n\nMost of Asiaâs people live in cities or fertile farming areas near riverÂ valleys, plains, and coasts. The plateaus in Central Asia are largely unsuitable for farming and are thinly populated.\n\nAsia accounts for almost a third of the worldâs land. The continent has a wide range of climate regions, fromÂ polarÂ in theÂ Siberian Arctic to tropical in equatorial Indonesia. Parts of Central Asia, including the Gobi Desert in China and Mongolia, are dry year-round. Southeast Asia, on the other hand, depends on the annualÂ monsoons, which bring rain and make agriculture possible.\n\nMonsoon rains andÂ snowmeltÂ feed Asian rivers such as the Ganges, the Yellow, the Mekong, the Indus, and the Yangtze. The rich valley between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in western Asia is called the âFertile Crescentâ for its place in the development of agriculture and human civilization.\n\nAsia is the most mountainous of all the continents. More than 50 of the highest peaks in the world are in Asia. Mount Everest, which reaches more than 8,700 meters (29,000 feet) high in the Himalaya range, is the highest point on Earth. These mountains have become major destination spots for adventurous travelers.\n\nPlate tectonics continuously push the mountains higher. As the landmass of India pushes northward into the landmass of Eurasia, parts of the Himalaya rise at a rate of about 2.5 centimeters (one inch) every five years.\n\nAsia contains, not only, Earthâs highest elevation, but also its lowest place on land: the shores of the Dead Sea in the countries of Israel and Jordan. The land there lies more than 390 meters (1,300 feet) below sea level.\n\nAlthough the Eurasian Plate carries most of Asia, it is not the only one supporting major parts of the large continent. The Arabian Peninsula, in the continentâs southwest, is carried by the Arabian Plate. The Indian Plate supports the Indian peninsula, sometimes called theÂ Indian subcontinent. The Australian Plate carries some islands in Indonesia. The North American Plate carries eastern Siberia and the northern islands of Japan.\n\nAustralia\n\nIn addition to being the smallest continent, Australia is the flattest and the second-driest, after Antarctica. The region including the continent of Australia is sometimes called Oceania, to include the thousands of tiny islands of the Central Pacific and South Pacific, most notably Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia (including the U.S. state of Hawaiâi). However, the continent of Australia itself includes only the nation of Australia, the eastern portion of the island of New Guinea (the nation of Papua New Guinea) and the island nation of New Zealand.\n\nAustralia covers just less than 8.5 million square kilometers (about 3.5 million square miles). Its population is about 31 million. It is the mostÂ sparsely populated continent, after Antarctica.\n\nA plateau in the middle of mainland Australia makes up most of the continentâs total area. Rainfall is light on the plateau, and not many people have settled there. The Great Dividing Range, a long mountain range, rises near the east coast and extends from the northern part of the territory of Queensland through the territories of New South Wales and Victoria. Mainland Australia is known for theÂ Outback, a desert area in the interior. This area is so dry, hot, and barren that few people live there.\n\nIn addition to the hot plateaus and deserts in mainland Australia, the continent also features lush equatorial rainforests on the island of New Guinea, tropical beaches, and high mountain peaks and glaciers in New Zealand.\n\nMost of Australiaâs people live in cities along the southern and eastern coasts of the mainland. Major cities include Perth, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Adelaide.\n\nBiologists who study animals consider Australia a living laboratory. When the continent began to break away from Antarctica more than 60 million years ago, it carried aÂ cargoÂ of animals with it. Isolated from life on other continents, the animals developed into creatures unique to Australia, such as the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), and the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii).\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef, off mainland Australiaâs northeast coast, is another living laboratory. The worldâs largest coral reef ecosystem, it is home to thousands of species of fish, sponges, marine mammals, corals, andÂ crustaceans. The reef itself is 1,920 kilometers (1,200 miles) of living coral communities. By some estimates, it is the worldâs largest living organism.\n\nMost of Australia sits on the Australian Plate. The southern part of the South Island of New Zealand sits on the Pacific Plate.\n\nAntarctica\n\nAntarctica is the windiest, driest, and iciest place on Earthâit is the world's largest desert. Antarctica is larger than Europe or Australia, but unlike those continents, it has noÂ permanent human population. People who work there are scientificÂ researchers and support staff, such as pilots and cooks.\n\nThe climate of Antarctica makes it impossible to support agriculture or a permanent civilization. Temperatures in Antarctica, much lower than Arctic temperatures, plunge lower than -73 degrees Celsius (-100 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nScientific bases and laboratories have been established in Antarctica for studies in fields that includeÂ geology,Â oceanography, andÂ meteorology. The freezing temperatures of Antarctica make it an excellent place to study the history of EarthâsÂ atmosphereÂ and climate.Â Ice cores from the massive Antarctic ice sheet have recorded changes in Earthâs temperature and atmospheric gases for thousands of years. Antarctica is also an ideal place for discoveringÂ meteorites, or stony objects that have impacted Earth from space. The dark meteorites, often made of metals like iron, stand out from the white landscape of most of the continent.\n\nAntarctica is almost completely covered with ice, sometimes as thick as 3.2 kilometers (two miles). In winter, Antarcticaâs surface area may double asÂ pack iceÂ builds up in the ocean around the continent.\n\nLike all other continents, Antarctica has volcanic activity. The most active volcano is Mount Erebus, which is less than 1,392 kilometers (870 miles) from the South Pole. Its frequent eruptions are evidenced by hot, molten rock beneath the continentâs icy surface.\n\nAntarctica does not have any countries. However, scientific groups from different countries inhabit the research stations. A multinational treaty negotiated in 1959 and reviewed in 1991 states that research in Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes. McMurdo Station, the largest community in Antarctica, is operated by the United States. Vostok Station, where the coldest temperature on Earth was recorded, is operated by Russia.\n\nAll of Antarctica sits on the Antarctic Plate."
