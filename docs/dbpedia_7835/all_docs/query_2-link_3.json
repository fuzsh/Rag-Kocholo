        "text": "Niger is the largest country in Western Africa. Since 80 percent of its land area is covered by the Sahara Desert, the majority of the 17 million Nigeriens live in the far south and west of the country. As a developing country, Niger frequently rates as the least developed nation in the world. Based on average age, Niger is one of the youngest countries in the world; however, approximately 30 percent of children do not live to see their fifth birthday.\n\nWith over 80 percent of Nigeriens identifying as Muslims, Islam has greatly shaped the culture and morals of the people of Niger. Christianity is practiced by less than 20 percent of the population. Religious persecution is rare in Niger.\n\nAlthough horse racing, camel racing and sorro wrestling are considered the traditional sports of Niger, soccer and rugby are much more popular among Nigeriens. There are both amateur and professional leagues for soccer and rugby. FCA Niger is helping to teach children the sport of swimming and volleyball.\n\nFCA Niger is experiencing firsthand how sports has opened the door for opportunities to present to coaches and athletes the challenge and adventure of receiving Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, serving Him in their relationships and in the fellowship of the church."
