This is preventing people from unlocking their potential.\n\nWe are working with local governments to make clean water, toilets and hygiene a normal part of daily life for those hardest to reach, from nomadic groups in the desert to fishermen living on the banks of the River Niger. By understanding the needs of diverse communities, we can help people to change their lives for good."
