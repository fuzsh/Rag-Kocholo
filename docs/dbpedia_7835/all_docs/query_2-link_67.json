        "text": "In the Sahel region of West Africa, Niger is struggling to feed its 21 million people.\n\nNiger has one of the fastest growing population in the world at a rate of 3.9 percent annually. As a landlocked country, Niger is used as a migration route for undocumented Africans traveling across the continent, and transnational security with bordering countries is an ongoing concern. The country’s poverty rate is at 44.1 percent, making it one of the world’s poorest countries. Top off these less than ideal conditions with the effects of climate change and you have what one researcher calls a “perfect storm.”\n\nKabir witnessed the severity of these conditions during her travels throughout Niger. She talked with farmers to better understand how they experience the effects of climate change. “Inevitably, they would mention the change in the cultivation period, which has become shorter, and the period of extreme rainfall, which produces more and more flooding. You read about these things in the literature, of course, but it’s valuable to hear it from those who experience it.”\n\nUnpredictable and extreme weather events don’t just thwart farmers, they can also have a huge impact on infrastructure — a fact Kabir discovered first hand during her travels.\n\n“There is pretty much one plane that flies around Niger once a week,” Kabir said. “I happened to be on that plane during a sandstorm and the plane had to land before reaching its destination.”\n\nAnother practical challenge to understanding climate change vulnerability in Niger is the limited access to basic research data. Without it, scientists and policymakers are unable to make localized, data-driven decisions.\n\n“It’s not like here in the U.S. where you can find a lot of the information online,” she said. “I went there, followed leads and leveraged my contacts basically to find the one person who had the data I needed on their laptop. It was sort of like The Amazing Race.”\n\nTraveling halfway around the world for data was a challenge and let Kabir see the unfolding situation with her own eyes — a nation whose existing economic and environmental vulnerabilities are putting them at great risk to the added stress of a changing climate. Kabir’s research finds an additional two million Nigeriens may become undernourished by mid-century solely due to the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. A grim picture, Kabir acknowledged, although it doesn’t necessarily have to be.\n\nNiger has time to reverse course and counteract some trends currently working against its economic and environmental health.\n\nDiversifying its economy will be key if Niger hopes to weather the storm of climate change, which means heavily investing in technology, infrastructure and education. Added efforts to deliever new technologies to farmers is also essential.\n\nA young population, which is economically active, can be a boon for Niger, Kabir said, but only if appropriate investments are made in education and skills development. Nigeriens can work abroad through legal channels and send remittances home. The newly effective Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement will also bring in opportunities in trade and services.\n\nFinally, Kabir said, a concerted effort is needed to address reproductive health and rights in Niger. To keep growing at such a rate, Kabir warned, will put a further strain on resources already affected by climate change and other factors.\n\nThe bottom line is that unless serious measures are taken to address the crises of education, reproductive health and economic reliance on agriculture in the face of climate change, the country will be in dire staits."
