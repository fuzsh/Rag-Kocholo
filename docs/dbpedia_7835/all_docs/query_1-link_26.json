        "text": "The Republic of Niger is a vast landlocked country in the Sahel, two-thirds of which is desert, and is considered as one of the least developed countries in the world. The government currently relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its budget, including health, and has committed to substantially increasing government resources for the health sector in the coming years. Niger has made remarkable progress in cutting under-five mortality over the past decade. Despite these efforts, malaria remains a major public health problem. The HIV epidemic is concentrated amongst vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men, sex workers, prisoners and migrants. The Global Fund is one of the main financial partners in Niger in the fights against AIDS, TB, and malaria, and also invests heavily in building resilient and sustainable systems for health.\n\nAHO PRIORITIES FOR HEALTH DELIVERY PLAN IN NIGER\n\nMobilization of external resources\n\nLinking public health with economic and social development.\n\nAdvancing toward an integrated model of health care.\n\nGuaranteeing equitable, high-quality health services.\n\nFacing emerging problems through the explicit definition of priorities.\n\nReducing the lags in health that affect the poor\n\nRESOURCES (USD)\n\nAHO NIGER 2020 (USD million)* based on 2017 pop 21.48 million World Bank\n\nSO BUDGET ITEM AMOUNT* 1 Combating communicable diseases\n\n170\n\n2 Tackling non communicable diseases\n\n200\n\n3 Addressing determinants of health & risk factors\n\n140\n\n4 Modernising health system and health service\n\n270\n\n5 Improving preparedness, surveillance and response\n\n150\n\n6 Developing good governance & corporate services\n\n170\n\nTotal\n\n2,148\n\nAHO estimates that it needs to spend at least USD100 per capita on health to meet the basic health needs of the people in Africa.
