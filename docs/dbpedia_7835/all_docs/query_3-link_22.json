        "text": "Nigeria Geography Stats\n\nClimate summary:\n\nNigeria is covered by rainforests over the southern third, Guinean forest-savanna mosaic in the middle third and both savannas and Sahel in the northern third. The mountain land is also found in the mountains near the Cameroonian border.. The most southerly part of the forest, especially around the Niger River and Cross River deltas, is mangrove swamp (see Central African mangroves ). North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water mangrove swamps, and north of that is rain forest.\n\nDefinitions\n\nArea > Comparative: The area of various small countries expressed in comparison to various areas within the United States of America.\n\nArea > Land: Total land area in square kilometres\n\nArea > Land > Per capita: Total land area in square kilometres Per capita figures expressed per 1,000 population.\n\nArea > Total: Total area in square kilometers\n\nAverage precipitation in depth > Mm per year: Average precipitation in depth (mm per year). Average precipitation is the long-term average in depth (over space and time) of annual precipitation in the country. Precipitation is defined as any kind of water that falls from clouds as a liquid or a solid.\n\nAverage rainfall in depth > Mm per year: Average rainfall is the long-term average in depth (over space and time) of annual precipitation in the country. Precipitation is defined as any kind of water that falls from clouds as a liquid or a solid.\n\nClimate: A brief description of typical weather regimes throughout the year.\n\nCoastline: The total length of the boundary between the land area (including islands) and the sea.\n\nGeographic coordinates: This entry includes rounded latitude and longitude figures for the purpose of finding the approximate geographic center of an entity and is based on the Gazetteer of Conventional Names, Third Edition, August 1988, US Board on Geographic Names and on other sources.\n\nLand area > Sq. km: Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.\"\n\nLand area > Square miles: Country land area.\n\nLocation: The country's regional location, neighboring countries, and adjacent bodies of water.\n\nNatural resources: A country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.\n\nSurface area > Sq. km: Surface area is a country's total area, including areas under inland bodies of water and some coastal waterways.\n\nTerrain: A brief description of the topography\n\nSTAT AMOUNT DATE RANK HISTORY Area > Comparative slightly more than twice the size of California 2013 Area > Land 910,768 sq km 2008 31st out of 235 Area > Land > Per capita 6.23 sq km per 1,000 people 2008 155th out of 224 Area > Total 923,768 sq km 2013 33th out of 251 Average precipitation in depth > Mm per year 1,150 2011 80th out of 178 Average rainfall in depth > Mm per year 1,150 2008 77th out of 169 Climate varies; equatorial in south, tropical in center, arid in north 2013 Coastline 853 km 2014 91st out of 242 Geographic coordinates 10 00 N, 8 00 E 2013 Land area > Sq. km 910,770 sq km 2008 29th out of 199 Land area > Square miles 356,669 square miles 2013 22nd out of 86 Location Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Benin and Cameroon 2013 Natural resources natural gas, petroleum, tin, iron ore, coal, limestone, niobium, lead, zinc, arable land 2013 Surface area > Sq. km 923,770 kmÂ² 2005 31st out of 204 Terrain southern lowlands merge into central hills and plateaus; mountains in southeast, plains in north 2013\n\nSOURCES: CIA World Factbooks 18 December 2003 to 28 March 2011; Food and Agriculture Organization; Food and Agriculture Organisation, electronic files and web site.; All CIA World Factbooks 18 December 2003 to 18 December 2008; British Broadcasting Corporation 2014; World Development Indicators database\n\nCitation"
