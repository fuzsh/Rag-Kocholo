        "text": "Federal territory of Nigeria\n\nFederal territory in Nigeria\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is a federal territory in central Nigeria. Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, is located in this territory. The FCT was formed in 1976[4] from parts of the states of old Kaduna, Kwara, Niger, and Plateau states, with the bulk of land mass carved out of Niger state. The Federal Capital Territory is within the North Central region of the country. Unlike other states of Nigeria, which are headed by elected Governors, it is administered by the Federal Capital Territory Administration, headed by a minister, who is appointed by the president.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory was created upon the promulgation of decree number 6 of 1976. It came into existence due to a need to find a replacement for the capital city of Lagos, which had become congested and had little space for expansion. The area chosen as the new capital was principally Gwari Land (the home of the tribes referred to as the Gbagyis, their language is referred to as Gwari) with high concentrations of Muslims and Christians and a high degree of neutrality from the dominant ethnic groups.[6]\n\nDecree 6 of 1976, gave the federal government rights over land within the territory. The population density prior to the takeover by the government was sparse with a population of 120,000 residents living in 840 villages and mostly of Gwari heritage.[6] Inhabitants were relocated to nearby towns like Suleja in Niger state, and New Karshi in Nasarawa State on the outskirts of the territory.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe territory is located just north of the confluence of the Niger River and Benue River. It is bordered by the states of Niger to the west and north for 179 km, Kaduna to the northeast for 45 km, Nasarawa to the east and south for 156 km, and Kogi to the southwest for 17 km.\n\nLying between latitudes 8.25 and 9.20 north of the equator and longitudes 6.45 and 7.39 east of Greenwich Meridian, The Federal Capital Territory is geographically located at the center of the country.\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory has a landmass of approximately 7,315 km2, and it is situated within the savannah region with moderate climatic conditions.\n\nNatural resources\n\n[edit]\n\nMinerals found in the FCT include marble, tin, clay, mica, and tantalite.[7]\n\nWildlife\n\n[edit]\n\nThe hills of the FCT provide home to many bushbuck, forest Black duiker, bush pig, chimpanzee and red-flanked duiker. Also found in FCT woodland are leopard, buffalo, roan antelope, Western hartebeest, elephant, warthog, grey duiker, dog-faced baboon, patas monkey and green monkey.[8]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nLike some northern states in Nigeria, the Federal Capital Territory is relatively mild. The Federal Capital Territory is usually very hot between the months of January and April.[9] The average daily maximum temperature of the city is above 30 °C or 86 °F, with the month of March being the hottest month. The rainy season in the territory lasts between July and October of every year but the coolest month is December, during the harmattan season.[10] During the harmattan, there is high relative humidity, coupled with windy and foggy atmosphere.\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nFederal Capital Territory Ministers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory is headed by the Federal Capital Territory Minister, Barr. Nyesom Wike, who is appointed by the Federal government. The Federal Capital Territory Minister appoints members to the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council.[11][12][13]\n\nSubdivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the Federal Capital Territory minister administers the whole of the Federal Capital Territory, the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) specifically manages the construction and infrastructure development of the region.[14]\n\nThe territory is currently made up of six local government areas, namely:[15]\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguages of the Federal Capital Territory listed by local government area (LGA) are presented in tabular format as follows:[16]\n\nLGA Languages Abaji Bassa; Dibo, Gupa-Abawa, Ebira, Ganagana Municipal Bassa; Gade; Gbagyi, Gwandara, Nupe, Hausa Bwari Gwandara;Bassa; Ashe; Gbagyi Gwagwalada Bassa; Gbari, Egibra, Hausa Kuje Gade; Gbagyi, Bassa Kwali Bassa, Gwandara; Gbagyi; Ebira, Kami, Abawa, Ganagana, Nupe, Hausa\n\nHausa language is widely spoken at the Federal Capital Territory.[16]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nSheikh Ibrahim Ahmad Maqari is the Chief Imam of the Abuja National Mosque (2017).[citation needed]\n\n21% Roman Catholic with 908,744 followers in the Archdiocese of Abuja (1981) with 137 parishes under Archbishop Ignatius Ayau Kaigama (2019).[citation needed]\n\nThe Anglican Province of Abuja, led by Archbishop Henry Ndukuba, Primate of Nigeria (2020), also Bishop of the Diocese of Abuja (1989), also includes the Diocese of Gwagwalada led by Bishop Moses Bukpe Tabwaye (2015).[citation needed]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council was elected in the 2022 Federal Capital Territory local elections.[17]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNigeria portal"
