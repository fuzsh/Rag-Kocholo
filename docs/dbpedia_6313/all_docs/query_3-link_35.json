        "text": "An analysis of the creative writing process as related to film and other media. A variety of styles will be explored and the potential of specific content for a visual medium will be examined. Each student will be expected to complete a script for a work of at least twenty minutes as a term project.\n\n(IP) Instructor permission required. Permission will be granted by the instructor on the basis of material submitted before the end of fall term.\n\nInstructor: Bill Phillips\n\nDist:ART\n\nThis course is designed to introduce film and media studies majors to some of the field's major scholarly methodologies and their theoretical value in explaining how texts, industries, creative artists, and audiences participate in the meaning-making processes. Students will read scholarship and participate in projects that illuminate how meaning is created and negotiated at the levels of industrial production, artistic creation of texts, and audience knowledge and engagement. The screenings, readings, and assignments will ask the student to think about the relations among his/her own position as a scholar, as an audience member, and as a creative artist. This knowledge provides a foundation for critical thinking skills necessary for the student's success in the major. The course is designed for students who have had some introductory exposure to the principles of film and/or television aesthetics and production techniques, but before they have completed their upper-division major requirements.\n\nAll Film majors and Film modified majors should take this course no later than their junior year.\n\nInstructor: Paul Young, Mark Williams\n\nDist:ART\n\nAn examination of the concept and use of genre with focus on a particular genre. How are the genres determined and how useful structurally and historically is genre as a concept of classification? What constitutes a genre? What is the relationship between periods and genres? Between genre and the Hollywood film? This course will consider genre as both an aesthetic concept and an economic one, producing stabilization and variation in product. The roles of repetition and variation, stability, and change. Genres may include the western, the crime movie, the women's film, the musical, family melodrama, the film noir or other genre-related topics such as film and literature. May be repeated for credit with a different topic.\n\nDist:LIT; WCult:W\n\n\"Film Noir\" evokes memories of stylish, cynical, black-and-white movies from the 1940s and 1950s—melodramas about private eyes, femmes fatales, criminal gangs, and lovers on the run. In this course, we will examine noir in relation to its many contexts: the hard-boiled fiction of Chandler and Hammett; the experience of dislocation and alienation that reflect the exile status of many central-European professionals who worked in the US film industry in the 1940s; and Hollywood blacklisting and censorship during the anti-Communist witch hunt. The course will also trace the pervasive presence of noir and its continuing appeal for artists and audiences throughout the world. Because of its artistic and political complexity, noir is a key term for the study of US postwar cultural history: noir narratives revolve around questions of racial and national identity, around the postwar crisis of masculinity, and the convergence of modernism and mass culture.\n\nInstructor: Gerd Gemunden\n\nDist:INT or ART; WCult:W\n\nThis course is an introduction to the history and development of the field of animation. We will explore this subject from various perspectives: by chronology, from its prehistory before the invention of film to the present day; by form. including, method and medium; by culture, comparing the US to Japan, Russia, Europe, and others; by subject; and by personality, concentrating on the figures who have shaped the art form and continue to influence it through their example. Students are expected to bring an enthusiastic interest in the medium, and to devote serious effort to reading about, viewing, researching, and discussing animation and the artists who have created it.\n\nInstructor: Jodie Mack\n\nDist:ART\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to the history of Latinx cinema, Latinx film spectatorship, and exploitation cinema in the United States. Latinx audiences have long been an interest and target of the Hollywood studios. Since the beginning of sound in film, the studios grappled with reaching this linguistically and culturally-diverse demographic. Since the late 20th century, the studios have widely acknowledged the box office power of that group. Time and again, however, the Hollywood industry has failed to accurately identify and engage Latinx peoples on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Applying theories of racialized spectatorship and performance and film genre and authorship, we will interrogate this historically troubled relationship and grapple with its consequences for Latinx representation and inclusion in American cinema.\n\nInstructor: Desiree Garcia\n\nDist:ART; WCult:NW\n\n\"Special visual effects\" has many meanings in cinema. When we use the term in the twenty-first century, we usually refer to computer-generated fantasy images of otherworldly creatures or impossible locales. However, the history of special visual effects begins with the basic technologies of photographically filmed moving pictures, and effects—whether matte shots using optical printers in post-production, rear- or front-projection process shots done live on-set, in-camera mattes and mirror shots, or \"creature\" effects controlled by wires, puppetry, robotics, or remotes—have served many purposes besides generating fantasy worlds. Beginning in the 1890s, the magician and filmmaker Georges Melies used editing, photographic processes, elaborate puppets, and ornate costumes and sets to take viewers up to the moon or down to the bottom of the sea. Only two decades later, however, processes similar to those utilized by Melies were primarily employed to film realistic-looking settings at a fraction of the cost of location shooting. Today, scholars of special visual effects try to answer historical as well as technical questions about what has motivated the incredible innovations of \"FX,\" the forms they take, and the functions they perform for producers and viewers. What determines these different uses of special effects? How have these processes and practices developed in the US film industry and among independent creators? And how do the standards of realism and plausibility—the standards by which special effects are traditionally judged—change depending on the era, the technologies being employed, and the culture in and for which films are made? This course will place us in the thick of such contemporary scholarly debates about special effects and their history. By viewing key examples of special effects cinema from the past century (primarily from US films) and reading what historians have argued about the significance of these films, students will learn to write and think in these terms and to develop their own educated stances on the topic—to participate as full partners in these scholarly debates. Students will also learn to consider such conditions as industrial history and cultural change as factors in the development of special effects as well as what these effects mean to their viewers.\n\nInstructor\n\nP. Young\n\nDegree Requirement Attributes\n\nDist:ART\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to Mexican cinema and the global system of filmmaking in which it developed. We will examine the history of Mexican film, filmmaking practices, aesthetics, and business concerns, as well as audiences inside and outside of Mexico. One central point of inquiry will be the extent to which Mexican cinema was truly \"national.\" We will question the concept of \"national cinema\" all the while analyzing the extent to which issues in Mexican politics, society, and culture were reflected on and influenced by the screen. The transnationality of Mexican film will be central to our investigation as we examine the influence of the United States and Hollywood during Mexican cinema's development. Students will learn about the various styles and genres of Mexican film and the theories with which film scholars have interpreted them. Among the filmmakers to be studied are Sergei Eisenstein, Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio \"El Indio\" Fernandez, Luis Buñuel, Alfonso Arau, Maria Novaro, Natalia Almada, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón, and Alejandro Gonzales-Iñárritu. Proficiency in Spanish is not required.\n\nInstructor: Desirée Garcia\n\nDist:ART; WCult:NW\n\nIn 1987, the Soviet Union was the largest political entity on the planet. Four years later, it had vanished from the map entirely. In this interdisciplinary course, you will learn about the 'new Russia' that has emerged in the three decades since that stunning collapse. Drawing on a wide variety of resources in English translation—from Russian films and novels to YouTube videos and social media posts—you will navigate the diverse technologies and media products that are helping to shape contemporary Russian identity. You will explore, for example, the 'violent entrepreneurship' of oil oligarchs, the cynicism of state-funded television propagandists, and the avant-garde theatrics of Moscow's feminist dissidents. Your study of Putin's Russia should also allow us to discuss some of the most pressing questions facing citizens in a democracy today: What is the nature of truth in the digital age? How do content creators and media consumers determine what is credible? What factors and forces are shaping the messages we consume through our televisions, tablets, and smartphones, and how can we learn to critically evaluate these messages in order to lead better lives?\n\nDist:LIT; WCult:W\n\nHow may films serve as a starting point for revisiting the past and rethinking the present? In what ways may representations of the Middle East differ over time and across places? And why do the stories told by filmmakers in documentaries, historical dramas, and other cinematic productions matter? Movies depicting the Middle East routinely draw mass audiences and consequently shape popular perceptions of the region the world over. The very same films, however, are all too often understood by many people as mere entertainment. In this class, we will consider what movies, if treated critically, may teach us about Middle East history. Beginning with a brief introduction to film and media studies, we will contemplate where the Middle East fits into this field of inquiry. Once establishing how we will approach movies and the Middle East throughout the term, we will navigate a number of key themes together, from war, memory, and migration to (mis)information, revolution, and representation. Along the way, we will watch everything from indie films to big-budget blockbusters. Regardless of the exact form these projects assume, all of the pictures we explore will generate debate and discussion around the past and present. Among the topics we will cover are the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, European colonialism, and America's legacy in the Arab world. To assist us on this journey across the Middle East and well beyond its boundaries, we will engage several primary sources, with motion pictures at the forefront. These thought-provoking items will empower us to partake in conversations that traverse languages, national borders, historical eras, and artistic genres, enabling us to view the Middle East in an entirely new way.\n\nThis course takes students on a journey, not to an actual place per se in France, but rather through a lived experience, known as \"Afro/Black Paris.\" Paris, a historical site of freedom from racial enslavement, has long been a contested home and homeland for Africans and their descendants, that is, diverse people racialized as black whose presence in Paris results from colonization, exile, expatriation, and im/migration, including African Americans. The City of Light is arguably one of the most beautiful and exciting destinations in the world. However, all that glitters is not gold. Matters of race and anti-blackness co-exist with a variety of myths, narratives, and representations of Paris and France as color-blind and race-free. Through French film, students will explore these and related issues and thereby gain a broader understanding of pressing social questions, involving anti-racism, belonging, inequality, racism, and their intersections. This course follows a lecture-discussion format.\n\nDist:INT or SOC; WCult:CI\n\nThis course will examine the films, careers, and legacies of two critics and directors who were fundamental to the French New Wave and its legacy: Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. Each is an indelible figure in film and media history. The two were at first close colleagues and then diverged radically, both as filmmakers and as people. Considering their respective careers in relation to one another will place their films into new historical relief. We will survey the important body of film criticism that each produced before becoming a renowned director, along with historical and analytical writings about both. Most importantly, we will examine major films and other media texts (such as television programs) that each created. Our goal will be to understand the phenomena known as \"Truffaut\" and \"Godard\" in relation to the development of auteur methodologies, assumptions, and practices. We will also consider the broad international influence of both directors, especially in film form and style. In addition to in-class lectures and screenings, the course will include a range of online and reserve assignments (films, readings, discussions). Two short papers, a research paper, and a final exam will be assigned.\n\nDist:ART; WCult:W\n\nThis theoretical and practice-based course is a study of the conversion of oral, historical, and fictional narratives into stage drama, cinema, and literary texts. Special attention will be given to the cultural and political implications of cross-generic transformation, formulaic conventions and concepts of \"genre,\" \"crossover appeal\" and \"adaptation.\" Throughout the term, the intersections of race, culture, and economics will be regularly questioned. Black cultural storytelling in various mediums and genres will be examined to serve as a point of entry into a discussion of cultural worldview and storytelling in order to aid and encourage students to explore the theories, concepts, and practice of adaptation from multiple, diverse vantage points and areas of interest. Building upon the adaptations they created in the first half of the quarter, students begin translating their stories visually in the \"production\" phase of the course. They assess how emotional information is translated into the original form and invent new ways of translating this content in their new visual format. Final projects can be interactive stage pieces, video installations, or films.\n\nInstructors: Iyabo Kwayana & Monica White Ndounou\n\nDist:ART; WCult:CI\n\nThe primary focus of Cinematography I is to explore lighting and composition as an extension of cultural identity to explore how to use the apparatus of the camera to tell a compelling story visually. In addition, we look at the elements of composition, aesthetic style, and lighting that factor into a visually compelling narrative. Whether fiction or non-fiction or all-around experimental, we ask the question- how can we use cameras to provoke emotional, visceral, and even intellectual responses in the viewer. The course introduces students to the artistic and technical language used across analog and digital platforms but emphasizes experience. Students also gain practice in the following areas: Mechanical Camera Control and Operation, Lighting, Principles of Color, Exposure, Resolution/Depth of Field, Movement, and Composition. Student mastery of these concepts is reinforced through dynamic class exercises and a final project. Additionally, students develop a sense of visual style and learn to interpret the appropriate application of it according to story or product.\n\nDist:ART\n\nThis workshop course introduces students to the art and craft of writing for television. We're living in the midst of the (second) Golden Age of Television. More and more Americans are turning away from the traditional movie theater experience and embracing long-form, character-driven, small screen stories. In the film world, directors are king, but in television, the writers reign. It is their vision that gets put on the screen. Throughout the course, each student will workshop and develop a thirty-minute pilot script and Show Bible, as well as read and analyze contemporary pilot scripts to see what exactly makes a pilot\n\nDist:ART\n\nHow does authority reach the ear? What are the sonic features of speaking truth to power? Who shapes the ways we hear, and where might we learn to listen differently? This course sounds out displays of authority as well as how we can act against such structures by turning to representations of the auditory in both literature and cinema. As we consider questions of sound and its reproduction, we will work across geographical contexts to determine which concerns resonate widely and what role acoustics, or the specific properties of a space, might play. Readings will come from writers such as Valeria Luiselli, María Sonia Cristoff, Franz Kafka, Frantz Fanon, and Severo Sarduy, while films will range from Fitzcarraldo to Sorry to Bother You.\n\nDist:INT\n\nThis course will examine the history of television as an emerging technology; its dynamic interaction with government, private industry, and audiences; and its impact on society and culture. It will include a consideration of both pre-television media (especially radio) and new media (cyber-culture) as they inform a historical understanding of TV. The norms and practices of the network era (1955-1985) will be positioned as a functional middle-ground, much in the way that classical Hollywood Cinema (1920-1960) serves as a middle-ground in motion picture history. Students will be encouraged to develop their capacity for a critical distance from contemporary media via this historicized approach.\n\nOpen to all classes. Limited to 50 students.\n\nDist:ART; WCult:W\n\nThis course examines the transformation of television in both its commercial and public-service forms by the rise of the internet as a mass medium, YouTube and participatory culture, and most recently, social networks and mobile communication. On the one hand, it will show, digital technologies and computer networks have disrupted the historical power relations between television networks and their audiences, enabling viewers to watch programming whenever and wherever they like, to avoid commercials, and to become producers themselves; yet at the same time, networks and advertisers are quickly finding new ways to adapt older business models and forms of storytelling to today's multi-platform media environment. Attention is paid to questions of agency in the control of programming flows and consumption; the shift from ratings to analytics, the emergence of transmedia storytelling as a production model; new forms of digital aesthetics (e.g., \"slow TV\"); and celebrity, branding, and neoliberal citizenship.\n\nDist:ART; WCult:W\n\nFrom silent films to Mad Men, the American city has been the site through which \"modern\" identities have been imagined and created. This course draws on Cultural Geography and Film and Media Studies in order to interrogate this development. Through a variety of readings and screenings of films and TV shows, we will be examining American downtowns, suburbs, and homes as sites for the construction of classed, racialized, sexualized, and gendered identities in three different time periods: the early 20th century, the post-WWII era, and the contemporary period. We will interrogate such topics as the real and imagined role of \"shopping\" women and gender in the shaping of modern downtowns; the relationship between the American suburb, new sexual identities, and the film Pillow Talk; and how a particular nostalgia for the past that has led to the popularity of such shows as Mad Men can also be seen on the streets of Hanover (neo-traditional urbanism).\n\nInstructor: Mary Desjardins\n\nDist:SOC; WCult:CI\n\nThis course focuses on the condition of exile. It takes as its main example \"one of the largest and most dramatic mass migrations to this country in the twentieth century,\" namely that of some 130,000 German-speaking refugees who arrived on these shores between 1933 and 1945. The course will examine several of the most significant areas that were influenced by this vital cultural shift: the American academy and intellectual life; the film industry (\"Weimar on the Pacific,\" as Hollywood was sometimes called); and, more generally, the political and cultural debates concerning the \"German Question,\" i.e., what to do with Germany after the war. We will explore how the exiles viewed their role and how they viewed the interplay between American and European culture.\n\nDist:INT or ART; WCult:W\n\nThis course is an introduction to the history of race and gender in American film. These fundamental social constructs in American life have been central to the development of American film narrative from the beginnings of cinema at the turn of the twentieth century. In turn, American films have profoundly shaped the ways that we think about race and gender and racialized and gendered beings. We will analyze the shifting and situational meanings of race and gender throughout the twentieth century, and in particular, how they have been influenced by the forces of history, including wars, economic depressions, and social movements. While we will focus our attention on Hollywood cinema of the \"golden age\", the period from the 1920s-1960s, we will also spend significant time considering American independent cinema and the post-classical period of filmmaking from the 1960s to the present. In our consideration of race and racialized peoples, we will include African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Our discussions of gender will be expansive to include not just women and femininity, but men and masculinity as well.\n\nInstructor: Desirée Garcia\n\nDist:ART; WCult:W\n\nThis course will examine the Latinx stage and screen, focusing specifically on musicals that portray Latinx lives. We will focus on canonical works—including West Side Story, Zoot Suit, and Hamilton—in order to deepen our knowledge of their form, production history, historical reception, and contemporary place in American culture. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, drawing our reading assignments from the fields of Ethnic Studies, American Studies, Performance Studies, and Film and Media Studies, in order to analyze these productions as they traveled from stage to screen (and sometimes, back to the stage) and the representational and cultural politics involved in that shift. Finally, we will explore not only the musicals themselves but also the historiography that has informed our understanding of them. Writing assignments will ask the students to reflect on the evolution of scholarly arguments regarding these canonical works.\n\nInstructor: Desirée Garcia\n\nDist:SOC; WCult:NW\n\nThis theory/practice studio course explores the medium of video as an art form. Through a survey of historical and contemporary works, students will examine how history, access, culture, and technological shifts have influenced and changed how artists work with the moving image and time-based media. From early portable video rigs and live video to the use of animation, netart, streaming video, and memes, the course will unpack the role that film, video, sound, writing, performance, abstraction, installation, structure, streaming, and narrative forms have played in their work. Students create individual video projects to develop their artistic voice and point of view; they engage with properties that distinguish video art practices while completing a series of creative experiments in order to develop a personal media vocabulary. Students will use video art to expand our understanding of time, space, sound, representation, and narrative.\n\nInstructor: Mary Flanagan\n\nDist:ART\n\nThis course, limited to Film and Media Studies majors or as part of a modified major, involves an individual project in some aspect of film and television history, theory or practice. The subject of the project, the term, and the hours are to be arranged. Each project must be directed by a faculty member of the Department. The approval of the faculty member and the Chair must be secured in advance, not later than the term immediately preceding the term in which the project is to be undertaken. This is a two-term project.\n\nStudents are awarded one-course credit for successful completion of this course at the end of the second term of work. Students register for FILM 93 and receive a grade of \"ON\" (ongoing) at the end of the term. Students do not register for the subsequent term. A final grade will replace the \"ON\" at the end of the subsequent term at which time the coursework must be completed.\n\nA thesis, screenplay, or film production written under the supervision of a member of the Film and Media Studies Department.
