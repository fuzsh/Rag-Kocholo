        "text": "DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0260210516000255 How do members of the general public come to regard some uses of violence as legitimate and others as illegitimate? And how do they learn to use widely recognized normative principles in doing so such as those encapsulated in the laws of war and debated by just war theorists? This paper argues that popular cinema is likely to be a major source of influence especially through a subgenre that I call ‘Just War Cinema.’ Since the 1950s, many films have addressed the moral drama at the centre of contemporary Just War Theory through the figure of the enemy in World War II, offering often explicit and sophisticated treatments of the relationship between the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello that anticipate or echo the arguments of philosophers. But whereas Cold War era films may have supported Just War Theory’s ambitions to shape public understanding, a strongly revisionary tendency in Just War Cinema since the late 1990s is just as likely to thwart them. The potential of Just War Cinema to vitiate efforts to shape wider attitudes is a matter that both moral philosophers and those concerned with disseminating the law of war ought to pay close attention to.\n\nCinema is a powerful media that can shape people's minds about different issues. Movies can focus on very detailed or hidden matters in society, and critical issues that profoundly affect the lives of large populations are usually at the center of cinema's attention. Among these issues are wars that can affect tens of millions of people financially, mentally and of course physically. Films can question or justify wars. To answer if they questioned wars or justified them one should choose a specific war, a period and maybe a particular group of films and analyze their content and discourse. However, to do so, it would be helpful and maybe necessary to first better understand how films may question or justify wars. The present research is an effort to analyze a specific number of movies to see in what ways they may have justified the role of the United States in the Second World War. The results include eight issues that the movies raised regarding the legitimacy of the war and America's role in it.\n\nThis paper examines five American war films (Green Zone, The Hurt Locker, Body of Lies, Rendition, and Jarhead) with stories distinctly counter to the dominant war, government, and soldier narratives promoted by government and mass media. Each of these films, although commercial failures in the U.S., serves as an example of the very acts of defiance of pro-war propaganda and the counter thinking that is called for by the scholarly work that grounds my analysis: James Der Derian’s Virtuous War, Judith Butler’s Frames of War, and Peace Journalism, War and Conflict Resolution (eds. Keeble, Tulloch, and Zollman). As such, the films can be viewed as a powerful interruption to the status quo useful tools for exploring the role of fiction, media, “truth,” and memory in a networked age.\n\nThis article will analyse how cinema can be used to challenge dominant representations of war by comparing two French coordinated portmanteau films, and examine the role of the film-makers as public intellectuals in France. Its starting point will be Chris Marker's Loin du Vietnam (Far From Vietnam, 1967), which was primarily about America's war in Vietnam. This film will be compared with Alain Brigand's 2002 film 11'0901 September 11 (known in French under the title 11 minutes 9 seconds 1 image), which uses the portmanteau format as a means of exploring representations of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks and the ensuing War on Terror. It will be shown that both works share several cinematic and political preoccupations, notably concerning the use of images in justifying and opposing war. It will be concluded that both films demonstrate how challenging representations of war can provoke a great deal of aesthetic as well as political debate on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nBrian De Palma’s Redacted stands out amongst the current crop of post-9/11 war films in that it contains an unambiguous critique of the Iraq War supported by an effective, visceral visual interpretation. To better understand Redacted’s function and intentions within the canon of post-9/11 war cinema requires a comparison of the film to De Palma’s previous war film, Casualties of War. De Palma endeavoured to provoke a similar debate on warfare in Redacted as he did with Casualties, as well as providing a nearly identical commentary. Redacted, however, is very much a part of a search by post-9/11 filmmakers for a meta-language sufficient to come to grips with actual combat experience. What becomes clear by comparison is that his earlier approach to characterisation, narrative structure, and visuals does not – and perhaps could not -- have the same impact on public discourse after 9/11. I contend that Redacted, as well as other Iraq War films, are engaging with past modes of filmmaking – with the New Hollywood Vietnam film in particular – in order to challenge or rethink media representations of war. A textual analysis of Redacted alongside Casualties of War will demonstrate that although the two films share several striking characteristics – psychological doubling of characters, themes in support of an anti-war message, and an intention to provoke debate – De Palma has revised the war film mode in Redacted in order to underline the incapacity of earlier war films to effectively convey combat experience. Therefore, Redacted should be viewed as a critique of the conventional Hollywood war film and by extension constitutes a form of self-criticism towards the approach taken in Casualties of War.\n\nOne important and influential popular culture product is fiction film. Arguably, even though fiction film is often seen as a mere entertainment outlet, its undeniable status as a socio-cultural commentator allows fiction films to impart values as well as capture popular imagination and consciousness. Fiction films, needless to say, can move or provoke the audience with their depiction of and focus on real-life events such as personal angst, the World Wars, the cold war, political struggles, economic downturns and natural disaster. One prevailing trend with regards to fiction film is that after the event of September 11, 2001, the interest in the war film genre gains its momentum. Speculations about the post-September 11war that ensued, such as that in Iraq, have allowed variegated representations of war to be made on silver screen, either reaffirming or challenging the audience’s perception of war. Employing close textual analysis, the main aim of this paper is to reveal the prevalent themes of some war films.This is done by focussing on the characters. This approach to film as signifying practices will help illuminate the themes of the films, hence, prompting criticalreflections of the film’s commentary of the war that it alludes to.

This potential contradiction converges on the body of the American soldier, whose physical suffering is illustrated with a combination of optical, photochemical, and digital means. This essay argues that the violence inflicted on the American soldier’s body operates along a melodramatic logic that ultimately redeems the soldier from perceived transgressions in Vietnam and the War on Terror.The World War II combat films made in Hollywood in the late 1990s and early 2000s demonstrate nostalgia for the celluloid-based, documentary-inspired techniques of the 1940s, while at the same time reveling in the possibilities of computer-generated imagery.
