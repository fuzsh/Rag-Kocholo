        "text": "Following the release of Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' in 2000 the ancient world epic has experienced a revival in studio and audience interest. Building on existing scholarship on the Cold War epics of the 1950s-60s, including 'Ben-Hur', 'Spartacus' and 'The Robe', this original study explores the current cycle of ancient world epics in cinema within the social and political climate created by September 11th 2001. Examining films produced against the backdrop of the War on Terror, this book assesses the relationship between mainstream cinema and American society through depictions of the ancient world, conflict and faith. I explore how these films evoke depictions of the Second World War, the Vietnam War and the Western in portraying warfare in the ancient world, as well discussing the influence of genre hybridisation, narration, and reception theory. I question the extent to which ancient world epics utilise allegory, analogy and allusion to parallel past and present in an industry often dictated by market forces. Featuring analysis of 'Alexander', 'Troy', '300', 'Clash of the Titans', 'Wrath of the Titans', 'Immortals', 'Centurion', 'The Eagle', 'King Arthur', 'The Last Legion', 'The Passion of the Christ', 'Agora', 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', 'Noah', 'Risen', 'Ben-Hur [2016]', '300: Rise of An Empire', 'Hercules', 'Pompeii', and 'The Legend of Hercules', this book offers new insight on the continued evolution of the ancient world epic in cinema.\n\nABSTRACT There is a military-sexual complex that provides a critical libidinal infrastructure for war. The role of sexuality in military recruitment and warfare often is overlooked in favor of a focus on the political economy of war that emphasizes the benefits of wartalk for politicians’ careers and the profits of warfare for industrial enterprises. Exposing the structure and operation of the sexual economics of war, reveals the value of gendered places for men and women in war and the operation of sexual regimes governing intimate relations in the military. As the number of women in the military has increased 15-fold since 1970, the military-sexual complex has adapted to exploit this new gender resource. The 2003 US invasion and occupation of Iraq resulted in the first large-scale deployment of US women in war. One important outcome has been the militarization of women’s gender and sexuality. We identify three ways in which women’s sexuality was deployed in the Iraq war: in the propaganda campaign to gain support for the war on the US home front, the abuse and torture of prisoners of war, and the provision of sexual services for military personnel. We conclude by discussing ongoing challenges faced by women who are a growing part of the US military-sexual complex.\n\n\"Women in combat” has long been a hotly debated topic. In 2013 the then Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, repealed the U.S. ban on women in combat positions, reinvigorating the debate. The arguments against women in combat predominantly vary between the question of physical capabilities, unit and gender cohesion, and “appropriateness” regarding the gender roles of society, or, indeed, all of the above. I posit that these arguments and objections are not as evident and objective as they are made out to be, and that they are directed and informed by underlying socio-cultural gendered images reiterated and re-established in all aspects of life. This study examines the manifestations of these images in three main areas – literature, army policy, and the media, and in turn reveal that these attitudes do not relate to the historical and contemporary reality of women in combat.\n\nMohamed Ali Semlali. Muslims are frequently stereotyped across different media outlets in saliently negative ways. This thesis takes particular concern with the medium of film specifically those from Hollywood. Given that films are the dominant medium of today, this is a legitimate means to understanding Arab-Muslim representations. A discourse exists on the topic; the most prominent scholars being Jack G Shaheen (2001) and Edward Said (2003).These scholars have written extensively on the topic of Muslim representations. Both of their writings are of tremendous value to this thesis, however, they both have notable flaws. Shaheen examines Muslim representations in Hollywood but uses little character analysis; as well this he does not consider reasons for why Muslims are represented in negative ways. Conversely, Said focuses on why Muslims were historically stereotyped during the colonial era, although he takes concern with the printed word (colonial literature) a medium of no relevance to this thesis (nor the current digital era). Therefore, this thesis is intended to situate within both of these scholars work; to examine Muslim characters in Hollywood films before and after 9/11. This will enable a perspective on how social events affect Muslim representation, which will aid with the second aim; to simultaneously examine why films depicts Muslims in either good or bad manners. This is of course different for each film, of which six are analyzed all between 1993-2007. Thus this thesis will discover if Muslims characters have changed after 9/11.\n\nThis article examines how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and Hollywood collaborated to manufacture the blockbuster films Transformers (T) and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (TRF) to sell in global markets and to sell a positive image of DoD personnel, policy, technology, and practice to the world. To show how, the article's first section defines the \" DoD-Hollywood complex, \" presents a brief 20 th-century history of its formation, and describes the current DoD institutions, policies, and practices that fuse DoD publicity agencies to Hollywood filmmakers. The second section highlights how DoD assisted T and TRF's production and contemplates why Hollywood solicited DoD support. The third section shows how T and TRF put DoD in a positive light. The conclusion addresses some of the consequences of T and TRF with regard to democratic theory. This article sheds light on how DoD interacts and partners up with Hollywood studios to make militainment.\n\nOn 24 January 2013, the Pentagon announced that all final obstacles preventing women from being fully integrated in the US armed forces would be lifted, including those concerning combat units. This decision had to come into effect on 1st January 2016 at the latest, unless the military could bring before Congress reasons that justified where exceptions could be made. On 3 December 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter made the announcement that all positions would be open to women, without exception. These two announcements marked the end of a long period of integration for women in the US armed forces. This also meant the United States had now caught up with other Western countries which, like France, had already opened almost all military positions to women several years previously. This study takes a look at the most important issues surrounding the integration of women in the US military, while indirectly evoking the resonance of this debate in Europe. It appears that the question of the integration of women in the US military, a politically sensitive topic, can result in stark opposition between the pro-and-anti-integration camps. The US military, meanwhile, seeks to move the debate away from the gender issue – to which it is often reduced – and towards the question of how skills are managed in the military. For each of the services, the main issue is finding the best soldier there is to fulfil the task, irrespective of gender."
