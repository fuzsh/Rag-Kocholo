        "text": "War movies have been around since the dawn of cinema, from the silent-era days to the present, with cinema’s technological advances that help to recreate some of the most realistic — and important — stories of battle audiences have ever seen.\n\nHere we feature fifteen of the most important war movies in cinematic history and touch on the impact the films made on audiences and the history of cinema. And we offer the screenplays for you to read — Enjoy!\n\nScripts from this Article\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nApocalypse Now\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nFull Metal Jacket\n\nThe Thin Red Line\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nBlack Hawk Down\n\nThe Hurt Locker\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima\n\nThe Deer Hunter\n\nHacksaw Ridge\n\n1. Schindler’s List (1993)\n\nIn German-occupied Poland during World War II, industrialist Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazis.\n\nSchindler’s List is a powerful and emotionally stirring film that depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and the people it affected. Its portrayal of the complexities of human nature in times of war and its message of hope and redemption is cathartic. Steven Spielberg’s direction won the Oscar and the film won Best Picture.\n\nRead More: Close Encounters with Greatness: Steven Spielberg’s Lifetime of Achievements\n\nDownload the script!\n\n2. Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, Captain Willard is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel who has set himself up as a god among a local tribe.\n\nApocalypse Now is a groundbreaking war movie that explores the psychological effects of war and the absurdity of military conflict. The film is known for its stunning cinematography, iconic scenes and memorable performances from the likes of Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne and Dennis Hopper. Co-written by George Lucas and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film was nominated for multiple Oscars and is notable for going well beyond its initial budget and production schedule, nearly driving Coppola mad.\n\nDownload the script!\n\nRead More: 5 Plot Point Breakdown: Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\n3. Saving Private Ryan (1998)\n\nFollowing the Normandy Landings, a group of U.S. soldiers goes behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action.\n\nSaving Private Ryan is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the chaos and brutality of war.

Full Metal Jacket (1987)\n\nA pragmatic U.S. Marine observes the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War has on his fellow recruits from their brutal boot camp training to the bloody street fighting in Hue.\n\nFull Metal Jacket is a scathing critique of war and military culture, offering an uncompromising depiction of the dehumanizing effects of war on both soldiers and civilians. Stanley Kubrick’s film was part boot camp film and part Vietnam War film. The first half is the most memorable of the two, where we see the psychological effects of boot camp drive a soldier to shoot his drill instructor before turning his weapon on himself.\n\nRead More: 94 Films Stanley Kubrick Absolutely Loved\n\nDownload the script!\n\n5. Platoon (1986)\n\nA young recruit in Vietnam faces a moral crisis when confronted with the horrors of war and the duality of man.\n\nPlatoon is a raw and powerful film that portrays the Vietnam War as a brutal and senseless conflict, known for its unflinching portrayal of the psychological and physical toll soldiers and civilians experience during the war. Director and screenwriter Oliver Stone won Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. The film was based on his own experiences as a soldier in Vietnam.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n6. The Thin Red Line (1998)\n\nAdaptation of James Jones’ autobiographical 1962 novel, focusing on the conflict at Guadalcanal during the Second World War.\n\nThe Thin Red Line is a meditative and poetic exploration of the nature of war and humanity’s relationship with the natural world. The film has breathtaking cinematography, philosophical themes and a brilliant ensemble cast. The film is far different from its other war movie peers, primarily due to the style of reclusive director and screenwriter Terrance Malick.\n\nRead More: 5 Plot Point Breakdown: The Thin Red Line (1998)\n\nDownload the script!\n\n7. Dunkirk (2017)\n\nAllied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.\n\nDunkirk is a tense and gripping film depicting the heroism and sacrifice of ordinary people during wartime conflicts. It is most known for its innovative storytelling techniques, intense action sequences, and emotional resonance. Director and screenwriter Christopher Nolan created some of the most visually-stunning war action sequences to date. It was nominated for multiple Academy Awards.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n8. Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nThe story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks.\n\nLawrence of Arabia is an epic film that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. The film showcases breathtaking landscapes, memorable characters, and groundbreaking use of cinematography and sound. David Lean took home his second Best Director Oscar, and the film won Best Picture.\n\nRead More: 5 Plot Point Breakdown: Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\n\nDownload the script!\n\n9. Black Hawk Down (2001)\n\n123 elite U.S. soldiers drop into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and find themselves in a desperate battle with a large force of heavily-armed Somalis.\n\nBlack Hawk Down is a visceral and intense film depicting the brutal reality of modern warfare through gritty and realistic portrayals of combat. It is also an examination of the politics and ethics of military intervention. It is perhaps one of the greatest modern war movies to date. Director Ridley Scott was nominated for Best Director. The film also has one of the best casts of then-undiscovered actors turned stars like Eric Bana, Tom Hardy and Orlando Bloom.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n10. The Hurt Locker (2008)\n\nDuring the Iraq War, a Sergeant recently assigned to an army bomb squad is put at odds with his squad mates due to his maverick way of handling his work.\n\nThe Hurt Locker is a tense and suspenseful film that explores the psychological toll of war on soldiers — especially those that deal with disarming IEDs. It’s known for its realistic portrayal of the dangers and challenges faced by bomb disposal units and its nuanced and complex characters. The film famously beat out James Cameron’s Avatar for Best Picture and Best Director. The winner of those two awards? Cameron’s ex-wife, Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n11. Fury (2014)\n\nA grizzled tank commander makes tough decisions as he and his crew fight their way across Germany in April, 1945.\n\nFury is a gripping film that portrays the horrors and chaos of the final days of World War II through intense and realistic tank battle scenes, and its exploration of the bonds between soldiers within those tanks. Drastically underrated and uncelebrated during its time, it has since earned many accolades from fans of war movies.\n\nRead More: Fury: A Valiant Ride That’s Short of Greatness\n\nDownload the script!\n\n12. 1917 (2019)\n\nTwo young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldier’s brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.\n\n1917 is a visually stunning and immersive film that offers a gripping and intense portrayal of war through its innovative and technically impressive “one-shot” approach, as well as its exploration of the themes of sacrifice, heroism, and the human cost of war. It was nominated for multiple Oscars but was also included in Quentin Tarantino’s list of overrated films.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n13. Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\n\nThe story of the battle of Iwo Jima between the United States and Imperial Japan during World War II, as told from the perspective of the Japanese who fought it.\n\nLetters from Iwo Jima is a powerful and poignant film that offers a unique perspective on the Pacific Theater of World War II. It offers an empathetic portrayal of Japanese soldiers and its exploration of the themes of honor, duty, and the human cost of war. Directed by Clint Eastwood, it is actually a counterpart to his film Flags of Our Fathers, which told the story from the Allied Forces side. It was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture (with Steven Spielberg named as a nominee as one of its producers).\n\nDownload the script!\n\n14. The Deer Hunter (1978)\n\nAn in-depth examination of the ways in which the U.S. Vietnam War impacts and disrupts the lives of people in a small industrial town in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Deer Hunter is a haunting and powerful film that offers a devastating and unflinching portrayal of the human cost of war. It explores themes of friendship, trauma, and the effects of war on soldiers and their families both in Vietnam, and back home in Pennsylvania. The film won Best Picture and Best Director (Michael Cimino) Oscars and Best Supporting Actor for Christopher Walken.\n\nDownload the script!\n\n15. Hacksaw Ridge (2016)\n\nThe true story of a conscientious objector, Desmond Doss, who becomes a hero during World War II by saving the lives of his fellow soldiers without firing a single shot.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is a gripping and emotional film that offers a unique perspective on the heroism of war, told through the eyes of a pacifist that refuses to fight — but will do all he can as a medic. The film showcases the powerful portrayal of Desmond Doss, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery and selflessness. Its exploration of the themes of faith, courage, and the value of human life makes it stand apart from other war movies. Mel Gibson’s Oscar-nominated direction is often praised for its visceral and intense depiction of the battlefield.\n\nDownload the script!\n\nRead More: The Top 10 Best War Films\n\nKen Miyamoto has worked in the film industry for nearly two decades, most notably as a studio liaison for Sony Studios and then as a script reader and story analyst for Sony Pictures."
