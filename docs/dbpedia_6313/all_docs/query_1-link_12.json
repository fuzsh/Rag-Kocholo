        "text": "The War That Made America\n\nDocumentary\n\nThe War That Made America brings to life a vastly important—but often misunderstood—period of American history, a period that set in motion forces that would culminate in the American Revolution. The dramatic documentary tells the story of the French and Indian War (1754–63), which began in the wilderness of the Pennsylvania frontier and spread throughout the colonies, into Canada, and ultimately around the world. Narrated by Graham Greene, The War That Made America combines a commitment to accuracy with a compelling filmed portrayal of the dangerous world of the eighteenth-century frontier. A central figure is George Washington, then a brash and ambitious young officer in his twenties hoping to make his reputation in the military, whose blunders actually trigger the war. A primary focus of the series, and a story that has long been distorted or forgotten, is the critical military importance and strategic diplomacy of Native Americans in the conflict between the English and French for the expansion of their colonial empires. It was a war the British won, but the fruit of their victory contained the seeds of the Revolutionary War.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: WQED, The War That Made America Productions LLC, Pittsburgh, PAYEAR PRODUCED: 2006\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Deborah Acklin, Laura Fisher\n\nPRODUCERS/DIRECTORS/WRITERS: Eric Stange, Ben Loeterman\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Peter Pilafian, James Callagnan\n\nEDITORS: William Anderson, Peter Rhodes\n\nPRINT MATERIALS: Teachers guide available on http://www.thewarthatmadeamerica.org/\n\nFORMAT: Video and DVD 4 hours\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: PBS Video\n\nLiberty! The American Revolution (1997)\n\nDocumentary and Dramatic Series\n\nThis six-hour series covers America’s greatest political story—the history of how we became a nation. The series spans 26 years, from 1763 to 1789, and traces the transformation of Americans from loyal subjects of the British king to revolutionaries, and finally, to citizens of an entirely new kind of country.\n\nThe War of 1812\n\nDocumentary\n\nThe War 1812 is a two-hour film history of a deeply significant event in North American and world history. The war shaped American, Canadian, and British destiny in the most literal way possible: had one or two battles or decisions gone a different way, a map of the United States today would look entirely different. The U.S. could well have included Canada - but was also on the verge of losing much of the Midwest, and perhaps the entire West to boot. The New England states, meanwhile, were poised on the brink of secession just months before a peace treaty was signed. The fires of this war forged the nation of Canada; at the same time, the result tolled the end of Native American dreams of a separate nation. By war's end, the process of Native nation removal had already begun in the southeast, paving the way for a cotton kingdom powered by slavery and a United States that had been on the verge of collapse was ready to announce its arrival as a global power. The U.S. did not win the War of 1812, but the noble experiment of democracy had managed to survive intense pressure from without and within.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATIONS: Production of WNED-TV, Buffalo/Toronto and Florentine Films/Hott Productions, Inc., in association with WETA Washington, DC\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2011\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: John Grant, David Rotterman, Dalton Delan, Karen Kenton\n\nPRODUCERS: Lawrence Hott, Diane Garey\n\nDIRECTOR: Lawrence Hott\n\nWRITER: Ken Chowder\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Stephen McCarthy\n\nEDITOR: Diane Garey\n\nNARRATOR: Joe Mantegna\n\nPRINT MATERIALS: Companion Book—The War of 1812 - A Guide to Battlefield and Historic Sites, available through PBS Distribution.

The documentary series explores the events surrounding the conflict between two neighboring nations struggling for land, power, and identity.\n\nThe Civil War\n\nDocumentary Series (1986-1990)\n\nThis nine-part series examines the history and meaning of the American Civil War, from its complex causes and the daily life of soldiers to its impact on the nation’s political and social life.\n\nAmerican Experience: Death and the Civil War\n\nDocumentary\n\nWith the coming of the Civil War, and the staggering casualties it ushered in, death entered the experience of the American people as it never had before—permanently altering the character of the republic and the psyche of the American people. Contending with death on an unprecedented scale posed challenges for which there were no ready answers when the war began. Americans worked to improvise new solutions, new institutions, and new ways of coping with death on an unimaginable scale.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: WGBH, Boston, MA\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2012\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Mark Samels\n\nPRODUCERS: Robin Espinola, Bonnie Lafave, Ric Burns\n\nWRITER: Ric Burns\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Buddy Squires, Stephen McCarthy, Allen Moore\n\nEDITORS: Lewis Erskine, Aljernon Tunsil\n\nNARRATOR: Oliver Platt\n\nPRINT MATERIALS: Program transcript and teachers guides available on the website www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/death\n\nFORMAT: DVD 118 minutes\n\nDISTRIBUTORS: PBS\n\nThe Great War (1997)\n\nDocumentary\n\nAn eight-part series that reveals the impact and importance of World War I, The Great War explores the poignant, powerful, and permanent ways the war changed the lives of everyone it touched.\n\nPearl Harbor: Surprise and Remembrance\n\nDocumentary\n\nThis film examines Japanese-American relations and the events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor, with special emphasis on the way in which various interpretations of events and evidence arise from conflicting national purposes and personal insights.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: American Studies Film Center, Inc., New York, NY\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 1991 (first broadcast on The American Experience)\n\nPRODUCERS/DIRECTORS: Lance Bird, John Crowley, Tom Johnson\n\nWRITER: Tom Johnson\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Mead Hunt\n\nEDITORS: Victor Kanefsky, Julianna Parroni\n\nNARRATOR: Jason Robards\n\nFORMAT: Video (85:00)\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: Direct Cinema Limited\n\nThe War (2007- Ken Burns/15 hours)\n\nDocumentary\n\nThe War explores the history of the Second World War from an American perspective by following the fortunes of so-called ordinary men and women who get caught up in one of the greatest cataclysms in human history. The film focuses on the stories of citizens from four geographically diverse American towns—Waterbury, Connecticut; Mobile, Alabama; Sacramento, California; and the tiny farming town of Luverne, Minnesota. Individuals from each community take the viewer through their own personal and quite often harrowing journeys into war, painting vivid portraits of how the war dramatically altered their lives and those of their neighbors. The War is an attempt to describe, through their eyewitness testimony, what the war was actually like for those who served on the front lines, in the places where the killing and the dying took place, and equally what it was like for their loved ones back home. The film does not sentimentalize, glorify or aestheticize the war, but instead simply tells the stories of those who did the fighting—and of their families. The film illuminates the intimate, human dimensions of a global catastrophe that took the lives of between 50 and 60 million people—of whom more than 400,000 were Americans. Through the eyes of these witnesses, it is possible to see the universal in the particular, to understand how the whole country got caught up in the war; how the four towns and their people were permanently transformed; how those who remained at home worked and worried and grieved in the face of the struggle; and in the end, how innocent young men who had been turned into professional killers eventually learned to live in a world without war.\n\nJohn and Abigail Adams (2005/two hours)\n\nDocumentary\n\nDrawing on the extraordinary correspondence between the second president and his wife, this joint biography sheds light not only on the characters of two remarkable people, but also on the tumultuous times through which they lived. John and Abigail Adams played a critical role in many of the pivotal events of their era: he was a vociferous participant at the Continental Congress; she was an important eye-witness reporter during the Siege of Boston; he was an important war-time emissary to France. In the post-war era, first as vice president, then as president, Adams was caught up in the increasing political divisiveness that characterized the 1790s when rifts in the country almost pulled the fledgling nation apart. In addition to a window onto the revolutionary era, John and Abigail’s story provides a strikingly intimate look inside a marriage of true companions, for whom life included not just the great events of history, but also laughter, loneliness, affection, and family tragedy. This American Experience program reminds us that the Founding Fathers—and Mothers—were not men and women of marble following a script that made independence and American national success a pre-ordained conclusion but rather real, flawed, multi-dimensional people, who had no idea how things would turn out.\n\nAndrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency\n\nDocumentary\n\nThis film biography of America’s seventh president explores whether Andrew Jackson is a president Americans should celebrate or apologize for. We discover how Jackson fought in the Revolutionary War when he was just thirteen—then used what he learned to kill a man over a gambling debt; how Jackson led the American army to the most surprising victory in its history in the Battle of New Orleans—but also launched an unauthorized invasion of Florida; how Jackson was the first great champion of the common white man—but also “owned” over a hundred black Americans; how Jackson dramatically expanded the United States—by brutally wresting vast regions of the south from Native Americans; how Jackson, in one of the boldest political strokes in history, founded the Democratic Party—and yet was viewed by his enemies as an American Napoleon. The film concludes with the words of Jackson’s first biographer, “Andrew Jackson was a patriot, and a traitor. He was the greatest of generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. He was the most candid of men, and capable of the profoundest dissimulation. He was a democratic autocrat, an urbane savage, an atrocious saint.”\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATIONS: KCET, Los Angeles, CA\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2007\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Carl Byker\n\nPRODUCER/WRITER: Carl Byker\n\nDIRECTORS: Carl Byker, Mitch Wilson\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Mitch Wilson\n\nEDITOR: Richard Kassebaum\n\nNARRATOR: Martin Sheen\n\nCAST: Brain Dennehy, Marion Ross, Eric Stoltz, Blair Brown, David Ogden Stiers\n\nPRINT MATERIALS: Press release\n\nFORMAT: Video/DVD (2 hours)\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: PBS\n\nRobert E. Lee\n\nDocumentary\n\nHe is celebrated by handsome equestrian statues in countless cities and towns across the American South, and by no less than five postage stamps issued by the government he fought against during the four bloodiest years in American history. Nearly a century and a half after his death, Robert E. Lee, the leading Confederate general of the American Civil War, remains a source of fascination and, for some, veneration. This film examines the life and reputation of the general, whose military successes made him the scourge of the Union and the hero of the Confederacy, and who was elevated to almost god-like status by his admirers after his death.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATIONS: WGBH, Boston, MA\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2010\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Mark Samels\n\nPRODUCER/WRITER: Mark Zwonitzer\n\nDIRECTORS: Mark Zwonitzer, Jamila Wignot\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Michael Chin\n\nEDITOR: Bruce Shaw\n\nNARRATOR: Michael Murphy\n\nUlysses S. Grant\n\nDocumentary\n\nThis multi-hour biography of Ulysses S. Grant paints a nuanced portrait of one of America’s most paradoxical leaders. The greatest hero of the Civil War, Grant was a brilliant military strategist who rose from obscurity to a rank held previously only by George Washington. However, the strength of the Confederate resistance forced Grant into a hard war that destroyed the South and led to his being labeled “a butcher.” Propelled into the White House by his battlefield success, Grant lacked the political skills to deal with the issues of the era: reconstructing the South and managing the nation’s rapidly expanding economy. His two terms were rocked by bitter racial conflict and corruption scandals. Seven years after leaving office, Grant was financially ruined by the collapse of an investment house in which he had placed his assets. He spent his final days in a race against time as he battled cancer while finishing his epic war memoirs.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: WGBH-The American Experience, Boston, MA\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2002\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Margaret Drain, Elizabeth Deane\n\nPRODUCERS/DIRECTORS: Adriana Bosch, Elizabeth Deane\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Terry Hopkins, Buddy Squires, Boyd Estus\n\nEDITOR: Jon Neuberger, Bill Lattanzi\n\nNARRATOR: Liev Schreiber\n\nCast: Alex Ingram, Julia Dent, Janine Jacques, John Jacques, Harry Bulkeley, Derek Nelson\n\nPRINTED MATERIALS: outreach resources can be found on the program’s website, www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant\n\nFORMAT: Video 4 hours\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: PBS Video\n\nLincoln and the War Within\n\nDrama\n\nThis is the story of Abraham Lincoln’s handling of the Fort Sumter crisis of 1861, just as he assumed the office of presidency.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATIONS: WGBY-TV, Springfield, MA, and Lumière Productions, Inc., New York, NY\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 1992\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Mark Erstling\n\nPRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Calvin Skaggs\n\nASSOCIATE PRODUCER: Robert Brent Toplin\n\nCO-PRODUCER: Paul Marcus\n\nWRITERS: Frederic Hunter, Thomas Babe\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Michael Spiller\n\nEDITOR: Jay Freund\n\nCAST: Chris Sarandon, Tom Aldredge, Will Patton, Remak Ramsay, Dylan Baker, Alan North, Joan Macintosh, Tony Carlin, Jack Gilpin, Pirie MacDonald, Veronica Cartwright\n\nFORMAT: Video (73:30)\n\nDISTRIBUTOR: PBS Video\n\nTR: The Story of Theodore Roosevelt\n\nDocumentary\n\nThis film looks deep into the life of the man who embodied the confidence and exuberance of America at the turn of the century, revealing both the heroic and the tragic sides of Roosevelt’s character.

In doing so he helped define the U.S. role on the world stage for the rest of the twentieth century. It was an unlikely job for a man who started his working life as a college professor and whose political interests lay in domestic reform. But once Wilson believed America had a responsibility to bring peace and democracy to the world, it was a mission he pursued tenaciously and one that would ultimately destroy him. His campaign to save humanity from future wars took a devastating toll on his health, and while Wilson’s closest advisors refused to publicly acknowledge his inability to perform the tasks of his office, his second wife effectively ran the country as president by proxy.\n\nMacArthur\n\nDocumentary\n\nNo soldier in modern history has been more admired-or more reviled. Douglas MacArthur, liberator of the Philippines, shogun of Occupied Japan, brilliant victor of the Battle of Inchon, was an admired national hero when he was suddenly relieved of his command. A portrait of a complex, imposing, and fascinating American general.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: WGBH-The American Experience, Boston, MA\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 1999\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Margaret Drain\n\nPRODUCERS/DIRECTORS: Austin Hoyt, Sarah Holt\n\nWRITER: Austin Hoyt\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY: Terry Hopkins\n\nEDITOR: Bernice K.

The first game in the series, Mission 1: “For Crown or Colony?” puts players in the shoes of Nat Wheeler, a 14-year-old printer’s apprentice in 1770 Boston who must decide if his loyalties lie with the Patriots or Loyalists. In Mission 2: “Flight to Freedom,” players take on the role of Lucy King, a fictional 14-year-old enslaved person in Kentucky in 1848. As players navigate her escape and journey to Ohio via the Underground Railroad, they discover that life in the “free” North is dangerous and difficult. The website includes resources to support use of Mission US in the classroom, including lesson plans, document-based activities, primary source documents, vocabulary activities, background on historical figures, writing prompts, and more.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: WNET, New York, NY\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2010\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER: Jill Peters\n\nPRODUCER: Michelle Chen\n\nWe Shall Remain\n\nDocumentary/Drama Series\n\nFrom American Experience website (http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/): a five-part television series that shows how Native peoples valiantly resisted expulsion from their lands and fought the extinction of their culture -- from the Wampanoags of New England in the 1600s who used their alliance with the English to weaken rival tribes, to the bold new leaders of the 1970s who harnessed the momentum of the civil rights movement to forge a pan-Indian identity. I think we only funded two parts. One of these episodes, Tecumseh’s Vision, could be relevant to this project.\n\nNo Job For a Woman: The Women Who Fought to Report WWII\n\nDocumentary\n\nBefore World War II, war reporting was considered “no job for a woman.” But when the United States entered the war, American women reporters did not want to miss covering the biggest story of the century so they fought for and won access. But there was a catch: women reporters would be banned from the frontlines, prevented from covering front page stories about generals and battlefield manoeuvres and assigned \"woman's angle\" stories about nurses and female military personnel. Several refused to abide by these journalistic conventions and military restrictions and, instead, brought home a new kind of war story: one that was more intimate yet more revealing. They reached beyond the battlefield and deep into human lives to tell a new story of war. Combining rarely seen archival footage and stills with actors reading the written words of the three main characters and interviews with contemporary female war reporters, the film focuses on the lives and work of wire service reporter Ruth Cowan, magazine reporter Martha Gellhorn, and war photographer Dickey Chapelle. The film is narrated by Julianna Margulies, Emmy Award Winner and star of CBS's The Good Wife.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATION: Hurry Up Sister Productions, LLC, New York City, NY\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2011\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Michele Midori Fillion, Jeanne Houck\n\nReporting America At War\n\nDocumentary\n\nReporting America at War chronicles over one hundred years of American war correspondents, from the Spanish American War through the present day and the conflict in Iraq. The documentary also traces the evolutionary nature of media-military relations in that period, through the experiences and reflections of the correspondents themselves. The revelations offer critical insights into how Americans perceive armed conflict, and the role of a free press in a democracy at war. A special coda added analysis of the experiences of the embedded reporters during the Iraq War.\n\nPRODUCTION ORGANIZATIONS: WETA, Arlington, VA, and Insignia Films, New York, NY\n\nYEAR PRODUCED: 2001\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS: Dalton Delan, David S.
