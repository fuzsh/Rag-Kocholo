        "text": "Course Description\n\nIn Art of Cinema, we explore the following: how does a film communicate information and meaning to its audience? What are the expressive components of cinema?\n\nCinema is a key component of our cultural landscape and how we understand ourselves and the world. This course is aimed at developing a deeper appreciation for film by developing critical thinking and reading skills. We will explore how audiences make meaning from artistic and thematic cinematic strategies by examining its core communication elements. Moreover, we will examine how cinematic developments have been influenced by technology, cultural trends, and time.\n\nDuring the first half of the course, we will break down the aesthetic components of cinema. (Cinema refers broadly to film, video, and digital time-based works intended for screening before a mass audience.) We will examine each element’s function in the production of meaning in a text, and in doing so, generate a shared vocabulary through which we can all speak and write with intelligence, confidence, and specificity about the ways in which a work affects us.\n\nIn the second half, we will discuss film history and genre by examining movie genre classifications. We then move into specific film topics that concern broader possibilities for cinematic expression. These topics include avant-garde and animation films that explore the medium’s relationship to reality and deviations from traditional storytelling. Therefore, during the second half of the course, we will use the language and grammar of cinema developed in the course’s first half, linking our aesthetic and technical understanding of film codes and language to generic and other formats -- in the larger cultural context.\n\nCourse modality – In-person lecture and screenings. Separate 50-minute discussion section also required.\n\nLearning Outcomes – At the end of course, students will:\n\nKnow the aesthetic components of cinema, including their historical development and the ways the function in the production of meaning, and be able demonstrate this knowledge in their exams and writing assignments.\n\nKnow a shared vocabulary that enables scholarly and critical film discourse and demonstrate this knowledge in their discussion and writing.\n\nUnderstand the relationship between cinema’s aesthetic language and the cultural, technological, and economic conditions that determine it and demonstrate this knowledge in their discussion, exams, and written assignments.\n\nValue the diverse perspectives we bring to our understanding, interpretation and emotional response to cinema.\n\nValue the diverse approaches that filmmakers have taken to their art form as well as the stories they tell.\n\nFLAG: Writing\n\nSeparate discussion required, see PROWL for times\n\nCourse Description\n\nStories matter. They help us find our way through a confusing and complicated world while providing us with positive and powerful images of ourselves. They can help us understand and empathize with others, especially those whose experiences are different from ours. They can reinforce our cultural attitudes and values or they can challenge us to think about difference differently. Through stories, we can better understand the ways that power and privilege impact different communities; compare the experiences of people from varied racial, ethnic, gendered, neurodiverse, class, and faith/religious groups; and gain an appreciation for the ways that race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion and disabilities intersect to form complicated personal and collective identities. This course investigates the ways that television, video games and content created for the web use and transform the elements of film language to create worlds and populate them with compelling characters in order to tell stories that shape and reflect cultural values and attitudes, especially those circulating in and around diverse and varied identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, faith and religion, and disabilities.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, you will…\n\nKnow the history and development of television, the internet, and study of video games\n\nUnderstand and be able to analyze the aesthetic aspects of an array of televisual, internet-based, and game texts with a specific focus on the ways that gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, faith and religion, and disabilities can be constructed through them\n\nUnderstand the ways that media scholars analyze and discuss texts and be able to apply scholarly discourse in their own writing and discussion\n\nBy the end of the semester you will be able to...\n\nExpand, deepen, and apply your critical thinking and reading skills\n\nDevelop a shared vocabulary for analyzing media texts\n\nDo a close reading of a media text--Refine your ability to construct and support an effective analytical and argumentative essay--Be able to reflect on your own learning and use these reflections to deepen learning\n\nBy the end of the semester you will value...\n\nThe contributions that marginalized groups have made and respect the continuing challenges they face to tell their stories in complicated and diverse ways\n\nMultiple perspectives and ways of expressing ideas creatively, analytically, and in scholarship\n\nThe importance of informed discussion and debate to challenge, expand and clarify thinking\n\nScholarly discourse and participation in a community of learning\n\nInstructional Methods\n\nThis course will have a blend of in-class and out-of-class elements. Every week there will be work you do on your own and we will convene on Wednesdays to go over it together, have screenings and discussions. We’ll start in a lecture/discussion mode, then shift to a student-led mode in which you will present materials and I will guide discussions. There will be a midterm and final exam as well.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course examines some of the most important industrial and artistic developments, and some of the most pressing and relevant thematic issues, in cinema worldwide from 1895 to 1955. Although we consider cinema culture today to be “global” in its various dimensions, the notion of a global cinema culture is fairly recent, having been preceded, first, by the codification of cinematic practices and conventions in the early 20th century. This course will consider world cinema in the “national” context of the World War era. As film industries in Europe and Asia respond to, and are threatened by, the outbreaks of war in their home countries, filmmakers struggle to maintain their positions, even as they innovate cinematic styles. At the same time, American studios establish their dominance in the domestic and global marketplace through powerful distribution networks and the popularization of “Hollywood style” narrative and audiovisual design. The films, filmmakers, and topics covered here will reflect on this broad period as a national, pre-global era of world cinema.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, students will…\n\nknow some of the most important aesthetic developments in world cinema during, between, and immediately after the First and Second World Wars, which will be traced to specific countries and filmmakers responding to these major conflicts.\n\ngain an understanding of cinema in a national context, where barriers of foreign language, culture, and government restrictions determine much of the content as new production and distribution methods are established.\n\nlearn and make effective use of important terms and concepts derived from cinema practices of the wartime period (e.g. Russian formalism, German Expressionism, etc.) that are still in use today.\n\nembrace the varied approaches that filmmakers use in cinema, the wide array of stories they tell with it, and the way they inspire, and are inspired by, filmmakers of other nations and cultures.\n\nvalue the diverse perspectives we bring to understanding, interpreting, and responding to cinema.\n\nbe able to demonstrate the above through discussions, exams, and written assignments.\n\nClass Format – In-person lecture and screenings.\n\nWork Expectations:\n\nMidterm and Final Exams\n\nTwo analysis papers\n\nParticipation\n\nCourse description:\n\nThis course is a critical and historical survey of some major developments, trends, movements, filmmakers, and industries in world cinema from 1955 to 1990 and beyond. Because it is impossible to exhaustively cover over thirty-five years of global filmmaking in a semester, we’ll focus our attention on some central themes and countries that demonstrate the differences between foreign and U.S. film by exploring the concepts of first, second, and third cinema, tracking the influence of World War II on global filmmaking, and examining particular national and auteurs’ styles.\n\nLearning outcomes:\n\nThis course will enable students to:\n\n● Identify major trends in global filmmaking after World War II\n\n● Appreciate the political and social contexts influencing these films’ production\n\n● Track different artistic and political goals for and theorizations of filmmaking across the globe\n\n● Develop critical thinking and writing skills about media and culture\n\nEngages critical perspectives and discussions of current movies and media, joined frequently by classroom encounters with media creators as well as actors, writers, producers and others engaged in contemporary media creation. Practical discussions of the creative process plus examinations of current professional trends are a focus; aesthetic analysis is a regular weekly feature. Professor Greene is a working TV producer and documentary filmmaker, and will draw on his own professional experience to delve deeply and specifically into the projects presented and the topics raised.\n\nIt is the intention of this course to demystify the contemporary media landscape by close conversations with working professionals as well as a free-ranging discussion of the themes and stylistic approaches represented by a wide-ranging slate of works. The course can serve to educate aspiring filmmakers about both professional realities and different creative approaches. For the casual filmgoer, the course is designed to challenge pre-existing viewing assumptions and open up different perspectives on media and how it talks to and about the wider world. There is also a strong writing component intended to focus and intensify our weekly classroom experiences through related prompts, and it is the intention of this course to help every student improve their writing.\n\nParticipation in class discussion and other class activities; weekly writing exercises; two analytical papers examining any film of the student's choice; and a multipart and\n\nessay-based take-home final exam. A weekly asynchronous writing assignment based on a relevant prompt posted to Brightspace is also a core feature of this course.\n\nMeetings: See PROWL for meeting days/times\n\nCourse Description: In this course, we'll explore the writings of Jane Austen, direct adaptations of those writings, and media inspired by her works. We'll look at films, television programs, and web-based series; we'll analyze Regency-era adaptations and modern-era updates in our quest to understand the continued relevance of Austen's literature. Screenings may include both the BBC and Joe Wright versions of Pride and Prejudice, Emma Thompson and Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility, and Whit Stillman's Love & Friendship (2016), as well as Bridget Jones' Diary, Emma., Clueless, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Austenland, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, and Bridgerton. If you are willing to duel on a moor at sunrise over which Mr. Darcy is superior, this is the class for you. If you'd prefer to exchange sprightly dialogue over tea and biscuits, this is also the class for you.\n\nThis class is a critical, interdisciplinary survey of virtual reality as concept and media technology. The last decade has witnessed the resurgence of a “virtual reality” that conforms to all expectations – sophisticated, technologized goggles and sleek prosthetics that help teleport your senses to new heights of entertainment. Yet the ubiquitous advertising of gadgets like the Meta Quest belies the far more diffuse origins and applications of virtual reality. This course conceives of virtual reality as a far-reaching idiom of mediation, one that intersects multiple diverse fields, such as psychology, education, history, and the arts. In the era of real-time production, Unreal Engine, AI-generated art, and multiverse storytelling, virtual reality has become an especially useful concept in reframing the key debates of cinema and media studies for the 21stcentury. We will ask: what is reality? Are movies reality? Is the mind an image? Is that air you’re breathing? Through weekly case studies, theoretical analysis, and hands-on experience, this class will explore what virtual reality does, what it claims to do, and what you are going to do about it.\n\nMeetings: See PROWL for meeting days/times\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION:\n\nBenito Martínez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny, is breaking musical records, breaking gender stereotypes, and centering his homeland of Puerto Rico in everything he does. What does it mean for an all-Spanish-language act from Puerto Rico to be biggest musical artist in the world? Bad Bunny has been the world’s most-streamed artist on Spotify for two consecutive years, has the longest-running Spanish-language album at the top of the Billboard chart, and in 2022 became the only artist in history to stage two separate $100 million-grossing tours in less than 12 months. As we examine his impact on global popular music and culture, we will consider what Bad Bunny can teach us in Latinx Studies. Through film, popular media, and interdisciplinary academic texts, we will explore his role in the mass 2019 protests in Puerto Rico, what these protests and ongoing struggles in Puerto Rico teach us about U.S. colonialism and Puerto Rican politics, and what Bad Bunny’s increasingly anti-colonial stance says about the current state of resistance in Puerto Rico (particularly among Puerto Rican youth). We will also pay particular attention to the politics of race, gender, and queerness in Bad Bunny’s performance, and how these politics disrupt dominant Latinx media representations. Overall, this course will explore these topics by closely situating Bad Bunny’s work in relation to key texts in Latinx Studies regarding colonialism, race, resistance, gender, and sexuality.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course examines the evolutions in Sub-Saharan African cinema (aka Black African cinema) from its emergence to the present. By highlighting the major trends (political, stylistic, ideological, etc.) that have emerged since the birth of this regional cinema, and by closely analyzing how the inner workings of the African film environment have shaped the art and business of African films, this course will enable students to fully appreciate the challenges associated with film production on the African continent. The goal is to help students expand their perspective on African cinema by discussing aspects that were once neglected in African film scholarship (such as financial viability, film genre, fandom, spectatorship, etc.) and by giving them a better understanding of the circumstances and events that have influenced the diverse types of films created by African filmmakers.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course will explore how contemporary reality dating shows gamify romantic social scripts. From The Bachelor’s “marriage plot” structure to testing whether “Love is Blind,” reality dating television transforms the narratives and idioms of romance into competitions where contestants compete to find love. Much of the drama results from individuals struggling against the rigid structures that confine who one can love, how one can find love, and how many people a person can love at one time. By examining this genre of television, we will analyze the way romantic scripts regulate gender norms, sexuality, and monogamy. At the same time, we will question whether the moments when reality breaks through the highly-produced artifice of television can expose the contradictions, harm, and fallacies of the romantic norms they seek to perpetuate. Possible shows include: The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Love is Blind, F Boy Island, Married at First Sight, 90 Day Fiancé, Love Island, Too Hot To Handle, Perfect Match, Couple to Throuple, and The Ultimatum.\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION:\n\nMixing nonfiction and fiction is obviously not a new impulse, but the exuberance with which modern filmmakers embrace the creative possibilities of such a challenge is.Today’s filmmakers no longer hold fast to the once rigid divide between fiction and non-fiction. Many, in fact, go to great lengths to gleefully erase/smudge/ even explode those boundary lines. In the process, documentary realism finds its way into works of comedy (Borat, The Office, What We Do in the Shadows), horror (Blair Witch, Cloverfield), serious drama (Close-Up, Nomadland, The Rider, I Carry You With Me), the experimental art film (Mysterious Object at Noon) and even musicals (A Hard Day’s Night, Spinal Tap!, O Lucky Man, Fear of a Black Hat). Meanwhile documentarians embrace fictive tools/techniques to embellish and intensify their real-world narratives: Dick Johnson is Dead, Flee, American Splendor, Man on Wire, Act of Killing, to name just a few. Mockumentary, DocuDrama, Faux Docs, Found-footage docs, historical reenactments, film pranks, deep fakes and hoaxes: hybrid forms abound, but just how far can the envelope be pushed?\n\nThis class investigates that question as students are urged to probe the meaning of fiction, question the foundations upon which truth is perceived, constructed (and manipulated) and assess the artistic value of blurring fact and fabrication. It’s as much about questions as it is about answers."
