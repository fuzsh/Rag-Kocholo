        "text": "An anti-war film is a genre of war film that is opposed to warfare in its theming or messaging.\n\nAnti-war films typically argue that war is futile, unjust, a loss for all involved, only serves to benefit few in society (usually an elite or ruling class, or the state), makes people do or support things they normally would not (such as homicide or discrimination), is extremely costly both in money and lives, or is otherwise undesirable for those fighting it, the target audience, or everyone in general. To illustrate their point, anti-war films often present the effects of war—such as destruction, suffering, war trauma, casualties, war crimes, war's impact on the environment or on children, or the excesses of war—in a negative manner. Though many anti-war films make this negative depiction explicit and clear for the audience to understand, some are more subtle in delivering their anti-war messaging (such as making the ostensibly good side as brutal as their enemies), or may use parody and black comedy to satirize wars and conflicts.\n\nWhile most anti-war films use real historical or then-ongoing conflicts—commonly modern wars in recent memory that the intended audience is familiar with or understands, such as World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, or the war on terror—as their settings to criticize those wars, their casus belli, or their effects, others use hypothetical conflicts (e.g. World War III), fictional wars involving fictional countries, or even a conflict in a fictional universe, an alternate history, or the far future. Some anti-war films may not depict front line or battlefield conflict at all, and instead present anti-war messaging through depictions of the rear, military hierarchy, military operations other than war, military misconduct or corruption, the military–industrial complex, refugees and survivors, or the aftermath of wars, ranging from the immediate post-war recovery to the post-apocalypse.\n\nThe following is a list of anti-war films.\n\nFilm Year Ref(s) 1917 2019 [1] All Quiet on the Western Front 1930, 1979, 2022 [2] Aman 1967 Amazing Grace and Chuck 1987 [3] The Americanization of Emily 1964 [4] American Sniper 2014 [5][6] Apocalypse Now 1979 [7][8] Barefoot Gen 1983 The Battle of Algiers 1966 [7] Beyond Treason 2002 [9] Beasts of No Nation 2015 Breaker Morant 1980 [10] Das Boot 1981 [11] Born on the Fourth of July 1989 [12] The Boy with Green Hair 1948 [13][14] Breaking The Silence: Truth and Lies in The War On Terror 2003 [9] The Bridge on the River Kwai 1957 [15][16] A Bridge Too Far 1977 [17] Die Brücke 1959 [18] Les Carabiniers 1963 [19] Casualties of War 1989 [20] Catch-22 1970 [21] Civilization 1916 [22] Come and See 1985 [23] Coming Home 1978 [24] Les Croix de bois 1932 [2] Cross of Iron 1977 The Day the Earth Stood Still 1951 [25][26] The Deer Hunter 1978 [7] Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder 1982 [27][28] Dr. Strangelove 1964 [29] Empire of the Sun 1987 [30] The Enemy Below 1957 [31] L'Ennemi Intime 2007 [32] Escalation 1968 [33] Fahrenheit 9/11 2004 [34] Fail Safe 2000 [35] Fail-Safe 1964 [36] Fear and Desire 1953 [37] Field of Honor 1986 [38] Fires on the Plain 1959 [39] First Blood 1982 Flags of Our Fathers 2006 [40] The Forgotten Battle 2020 Forrest Gump 1994 [41] Fort Apache 1948 [42] Fort Graveyard 1965 [43] The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse 1921 [44] Free State of Jones 2016 [45] F.T.A. 1972 [46] Friend of the World 2020 [47] Friendly Fire 1979 [48] The Frozen War 1973 [2] Full Metal Jacket 1987 [49] Gallipoli 1981 [50] Gardens of Stone 1987 [51] Go Tell the Spartans 1977 [52] Goodbye Billy 1971 [2] Grace Is Gone 2007 [53] La grande guerra 1959 [54] La Grande Illusion 1937 [54][55] Grave of the Fireflies 1988 [56] The Great Dictator 1940 [57] The Greatest Beer Run Ever 2022 Greenery Will Bloom Again 2014 [58] Greetings 1968 [59] The Glassworker 2024 [60] The Ground Truth 2006 [61] Hacksaw Ridge 2016 [62] Hair 1979 [63] Hamburger Hill 1987 [24] Hearts and Minds 1974 [9] Hedd Wyn 1992 [64] Hell Is for Heroes 1962 [65] Hell on Earth 1928 [2] A Hidden Life 2019 [66] Hiroshima mon amour 1959 [29] Hijacking Catastrophe 2004 [9] Honor Guard 2007 Hotel Rwanda 2004 [29] How I Won the War 1967 [67] Howl's Moving Castle 2004 The Human Bullet 1968 [68] The Human Condition 1959-1961 [69] Iluminados por el fuego 1989 [70] In the Valley of Elah 2007 [7][71] Innocent Voices 2004 [72] J'accuse 1919 [29] Jacob's Ladder 1990 [73] Johnny Got His Gun 1971 [2] Jojo Rabbit 2019 [74][75] Journey's End 1930 [2] Joyeux Noël 2005 [76] Kameradschaft 1931 [2] Kanal 1956 [77] Kelly's Heroes 1970 [78][79][80] King and Country 1964 [54] King of Hearts 1966 [81] Letters from Iwo Jima 2006 [82] Lions for Lambs 2007 [83] Little Big Man 1970 [84] Lord of War 2005 [85] Love and Honor 2013 [86] Major Dundee 1965 [87] Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media 1992 [9] Many Wars Ago 1970 [88] M*A*S*H 1970 [29] Maudite soit la guerre 1914 [89][90] Memphis Belle 1990 The Memory of Justice 1978 [91] Men in War 1957 [92] Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence 1983 Mickey Mouse in Vietnam 1969 [93] Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind 1984 [56] Neighbours 1952 [94] No Man's Land 2001 [29][95] Occupation 101: Voices of the Silenced Majority 2006 [9] Off Limits 1988 [96] Oh!
