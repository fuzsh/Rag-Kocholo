        "text": "This Moy & Bastie cine camera, made of wood and metal, is of the type used by British Official cinematographers working with the armed forces during the First World War. Lieutenant Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell used a Moy & Bastie to record memorable footage that was edited into the epic film, The Battle of the Somme. Around 20 million tickets were sold to see the film and it had a huge impact on the British public's perception of the war. The large dimensions of the Moy & Bastie when mounted on its associated tripod, made it very cumbersome. Those operating the camera became easy targets for enemy snipers. Malins and McDowell found it impossible to capture close-ups of men climbing out of their trenches. They consequently filmed staged recreations of 'over the top' scenes for inclusion in the final film.\n\nThe De Vry Standard was a rugged, all-metal newsreel-type cine camera. It was nicknamed 'The Lunch Box' because of its rectangular shape. The De Vry was the camera most widely used by members of the British Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) during the Second World War. The portable nature of the camera enabled camera operators to get much closer to the action than in the First World War. The AFPU filmed in every British theatre of operations and included cameramen such as Sergeant George Laws and Sergeant Mike Lewis. Lewis transferred from the Parachute Brigade to the AFPU, and filmed the Battle of Arnhem and the Liberation of Bergen-Belsen.\n\nThe Cunningham Combat Camera was named after Harry Cunningham, the camera engineer who designed and built it during the Second World War. Made from magnesium, it was a lightweight design which made it ideal for filming live combat footage. Features included special grip handles and a rifle stock which ensured it was steady enough for hand-held use in the field. It was electric-powered and ran off small batteries, had a four-lens turret and lenses robust enough for use in tough conditions. However, the camera was not widely used and only came into service late in the war.\n\nThe Eyemo was a popular camera model during the Second World War. Manufactured by Bell & Howell, its benefits were its small size and robustness. However, it was also cumbersome. Both the camera and the film rolls it used were heavy and, in order to shoot steady footage, a tripod was needed. Eager to get to the action as quickly as they could, cameramen often dispensed with the tripod. As with other wind-up cameras, breaks in filming occurred as the camera operator rewound it. Despite these issues, the Eyemo was hugely in demand during the war and was used by the US Armed Forces in particular. This type of Eyemo camera was especially favoured by those filming from night-bombers. However, the user of this example made documentary shorts for the Crown Film Unit.\n\nThis Cine-Kodak Eight Model 20 cine camera was used by Royal Navy officer Norman Tod to film various events during the Second World War. He served aboard HMS Ajax and HMS Norfolk and his amateur footage includes the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate. The Cine-Kodak first appeared in 1923 and this, less pricey, model was introduced in 1932. They were popular for home movie-makers during the 1930s. This example is complete with a case, instructions, condensed instructions, an exposure guide and a filter guide."
