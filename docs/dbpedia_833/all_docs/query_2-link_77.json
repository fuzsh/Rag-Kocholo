        "text": "My friend and I, both experienced riders, had a nice time on this trails today until we didn't With leaves on the ground, the shoulders on both sides of the trail are obscured. The paved trail is likely 3-4 inches higher than the shoulder. A few times heading north, we rode behind each other and to the right to create space of people coming towards us. We were several yards shy of parking lot at Gilson St when my friend moved right to make space. Obscured by piled up leaves, she could not appreciate where the the pavement ended and the shoulder dropped off. She corrected back onto the path, but not before her tires slipped on the leaves, and she suddenly lost control of the bike. She fell to the ground. I was behind her. Given the way she fell across the path, I couldn't avoid her, Two of us were now on the ground, bikes, too. I am grateful to the folks who stopped to help and show concern for our well-being. I am so very grateful to the gentleman, Tom, who took me back to my car in Ayer so I could come back and pick up my friend and our bikes, delaying his own cycling.. Thanks to the man who helped my put my friend's bike in my car. My friend is undergoing a medical evaluation to determine the extent of her injuries to her back, flank, and hip. Thankfully she was wearing a helmet when she struck the back of her head on the pavement.\n\nFirst-timer on this trail, solo trip, I started in Nashua and traveled the full length, I took some time to explore off-road paths as well. Parking was great, a large lot with a porta-potty.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this trail. I was there in August 19', I heard all the sounds of late summer in the woods and saw growing corn, ranches, peaceful wetlands, etc.\n\nI don't generally stop for snacks on solos, but noted that there were places at several points along the trail to do so. Including an abutter's yard where they have cold drinks in a machine for $1 and seats to rest in. Thanks to that family/person, very cool of you!\n\nI found that heading North to South was *slightly* easier. I didn't find anything particularly challenging on the paved trail but you could opt to coast a bit more in this direction. The trail is suitable for just about anyone to bike on. You can make it leisurely or push yourself and get a solid workout.\n\nNotables:\n\n- Each of the road crossings are clearly marked, helpful for new riders and/or kids\n\n- A lot of things to look at; farmland, wetland, horses, river/damn\n\n- Well maintained at the time of my visit (didn't experience problems with tree trunks, much of my ride was sitting back on the seat, arms at my side)\n\nDefinitely going back in the fall, will be worth a visit once the colors start to change\n\nI offload my bike at the Groton parking lot. I take a right and follow the Ayer route. Not far off the route in Ayer are some great eating places and shopping. I then double back to the Groton site, and there is a brand new restaurant right off the trail with outdoor seating. There is also a bike safety and repair station here. Continuing to Pepperell there is a lake on your left where it is great to pack a snack or a picnic lunch to have right there with a great view and there is some seating available. Once you enter Pepperell, there is a cute diner right off the trail, as well as a great ice cream place. When you continue on, and get close to Nashua, there are some very friendly horses that enjoy carrots on your right, and there is a trail friendly neighbor, also on the right, whom has put a vending machine as well as seating for a nice resting area for your enjoyment on their own property. Although I bring my own water, I always purchase something from the vending machine, just to show my appreciation.\n\nI live near one of the main stopping points for this Rail Trail. It's gorgeous in any and every season. I noticed a lot of people saying there isn't a stopping point from Ayer until you get to Pepperell - don't forget about Groton! If you stop near the bus depot and go up the road, there is a health food place with some GREAT smoothies as well as a Dunkin' Donuts and a convenience store. From Pepperell to Nashua, there aren't any major stops, but there is a vending machine with a few chairs if you bring a couple dollar bills!\n\nOverall, this is a great, family-friendly, small town Rail Trail. It cuts through some of New England's best small towns (in my entirely biased opinion) and both terminal points are worth a little look around (though Ayer might be more accessible, especially with kids!).\n\nRode on a cloudy Saturday, midday. What's great about this trail: pavement end-to-end is in very good shape overall, with only 7 small local streets to cross (at well-marked intersections and respectful vehicle traffic), so this is perhaps the longest trail in the Eastern part of MA if you want to avoid vehicle traffic; surprisingly not crowded on a Saturday; a couple spots with nice scenery (small pond with uninspiring view of Nashoba Valley vineyard, duckweed choked Nashua river and Pepperell dam and vintage storefronts); tree canopy most of the way to protect from sun and (when we rode) a light rain shower; and pretty flat the entire way, if you like that. What's not so great about this trail: mostly riding through woods and occasional backyards, so not particularly interesting visually; the path is very straight and flat the whole way so, again, not very interesting; and with all the tree cover, I expect this might be a bit of a mess when leaves start falling. The four stars is principally attributable to the length of the trail and its overall condition.\n\nWe did this trail with adults and children. Overall, the trail was great, some spots with bumps and holes that are marked but nothing more than any other rail trails in the area.\n\nWe did 8 miles round trip leaving Ayer and turning around after ice cream in Pepperell. Mostly flat, straight and shady. We saw the beaver lodge. Things did get a little smelly where the water became stagnant at the dam in Pepperell.\n\nParking seems plentiful on a Saturday (no commuters in Ayer) and there are other decent sized lots along the way as alternates if the Ayer lot is full.\n\nUnlike other rail trails closer to Boston, there isn't any small convenience store or Trader Joe's once you leave Ayer until you get to Pepperell. So, make sure you have enough water and have used the Porta-Johns. We saw a few men at different parts of the trail relieving themselves behind trees.\n\nI had been planning this ride for a while. Given the rave reviews I was full of anticipation. Beautiful day to ride I was stoked; until I hit my first pot hole and I haven't gone a mile. This is a beautiful scenic trail but currently not road bike friendly. Way too many holes and wripples that will jar your back teeth. An attempt has been made to circle, with white paint, many of these damaging front fork land mines. The wripples have also been highlighted but they are still many surprises. If you ride a road bike take it slow enjoy the scenery and outdoors; mountain bike or regular rider with fatty tires recommended. I spoke with two inline skaters and they had the same complaint bait they knew where the flat stretches were. Hiking would be best. As a rider I rate this one star. I have ridden a lot of local trails Nashua River is by far the worse path maintenance for cycling.\n\nMy wife doesn't like to ride on the street, so I thought we would try this rail trail. We got to the Ayer trail head about 11AM on a recent Sunday...only about 3 or 4 spaces left. Not clear if we'd get towed at the Santander Bank. There are other spots to enter, like in Groton or Pepperell.\n\nFairly even trail, although my wife was tiring on the return. Yes, there are some bumps, but they're well marked.\n\nAt about the 10-11 mile mark (northbound) an enterprising person has a Coke machine set up trailside. Unfortunately, there's no signage so you're past it before you realize it's there and legit (I think, we didn't stop).\n\nWe'll definitely be back, as it's only 30 mins from our house. Should be really nice (and more crowded) in the fall.\n\n10/29/15 Today I started at the Countryside Dr. Entrance in Nashua , I guess where the trail starts. There was a big sign that said \"Nashua Rail Trail\" so I know I was there. The trail starts with a very rocky dirt path and various converging paths that head in every direction away from it- that looked the same . There were no markers or directions as to which way the trail went. Two trucks blocking the trail with men filling the \"trail\" with dirt confirmed that I was still on the trail. After about 20 minutes of this, including huge mud puddles because it had just rained, I came upon a lovely paved road that passed a school, where I saw other bikers. This paved road eventually became \"Main St.\" In Dunstable. That was the end of the \"rail trail\" for me. I continued on even though it now contained cars hoping a sign would lead me back to it. i finally passed the Dunstable Library, where I was told I was two miles from the trail. Although it was still a beautiful ride, I was so interested in seeing the trail , riding without cars , and I think that there should have been at least little arrows to show a person how to stay on trail. However, the part of the trail that I was on for 20 minutes was just a rocky path through the woods, more suited to hiking. Next time I will start in Pepperel where there is an actual trail by the river.\n\nDoes this trail deseerve 5 stars? No, probably more like 3-4, but it certainly deserves more than a one star.\n\nI was here yesterday, August 2. One day after the previous reviewer. There are no weeds across the trail at any point. It was clean and clear just like the other times I have been this year.\n\nYes, the ride can be bumpy. Alot of it is not frost heaves, but tree roots under the asphalt. While a bit bumpy, they have marked 90% of the bumps and holes with white paint to give you a warning.\n\nThis trail winds past some backyards in Ayer, but then opens up to fields, marshes, bogs, a pond with a beaver damn. Most of the time it is a lovely shaded ride, and eventually has you riding along the Nashua River. About 8 miles into the ride, stop and treat yourself to an ice cream or a lime rickey! Can't wait to go back in the fall, bet the colors are pretty!\n\nThis is a nice little trail for the area, much less crowded than the Minuteman Trail. Yes, the Cape Rail trail is nice, but unless I am on the Cape, it is not a destination.\n\nIf you're looking for a great bike path to spend time on, either by yourself or with the company of others, the Nashua River Rail Trail has it all. From the flat paved pathway to the scenic peek-a-boos that you encounter along the way, this 12.3 mile trail will take you from the trailhead's generous parking lot located at the end of Countryside Road in Nashua, NH to its end at Ayer, Mass. My better half and I made this trip in one hour's time (one way). Bring a few dollars with you so you will be able to stop and get some cold refreshments, ice cream or food along the way in the towns of Pepperell or Ayre. So whether you walk, ride, run or roller blade, the Nashua River Rail Trail is something you should consider.\n\nThis trail is very fun. It is about 12 miles long but the mile markers on the path are 1/2 a mile off because there are 2 one mile markers. It is mostly shaded and goes through some marsh/swamp areas where there is lots of wildlife. We saw a fawn on the way to Nashua. There is not much off the trail except in Pepperel where there are a few stores and an ice cream shop. There is also a restaurant. It is pretty easy to bike both ways because it is very flat. There are no road sections and only a few road crossings. In one of the bridges you go under there are some paintings on one side that you should stop to look at. Though it may seem long it really isn't. It took us a little over 6 hours to do the whole trail from Ayer to Nashua and back to Ayer. This is definitely worth doing.\n\nWe were able to get out on one of the first weekends with comfortable weather shortly after the snow had melted. The bike path is a real asset to this area, and was once again an enjoyable outing. The most scenic stretch was from Pepperell to Groton. We turned around just below Groton where the salt marshes are.\n\nThe southbound stretch from Pepperell to Groton was slightly uphill. It's still a rail bed, so it's not at all hilly, but just be advised when planning. There was about a two gear difference between the two directions.\n\nRoots continue to be an issue. They are marked, but they are a problem in the making. We also wished that there were a few more spots to sit down and take a break. With younger children, we sometimes need to relax for a few minutes.\n\nWe stopped for ice cream in Pepperell at the restaurant with a window across the street from the trail. It was awful! It tasted like it had been stored since the fall - and was more ice-like than creamy.\n\nWe rode this from N.H. to Ayers and back stopping in Ayers for lunch before our return trip. For a weekday I was surprised at the traffic on the trail. Completely asphalt paved, any rough areas painted, making them easy to avoid. Scenery was awesome the entire route. Most all of the trail is covered by trees making for a cool ride on a sunny day. Being from Kansas and flying into the area I wasn't able to bring my own bicycle and had to rent one. We went to Goodale's Bike Shop in Nashua. I was expecting a rental bicycle to be a piece of crap, but not a Goodale's. They asked me what I usually rode. They set me up with a Cannondale compatible to my bicycle for $35 for 24 hours. I used my Map my ride app and the ride was just over 25 miles with a 135 foot gain. No hills to speak of. Wonderful ride would love to do it again. My next ride is going to be some or all of the 200+ miles of the Katy in Missouri. Happy riding.\n\nThis nice paved trail connects Nashua NH to Ayer Ma. It is paved and flat.\n\nMost of the users of this trail seem to know bicycle courtesy and yield to those \"passing on the left\". It crosses just a few streets and all the drivers are aware of the bicycles and yield appropriately. The trail is well maintained and the bumps and heaves are painted white, which is a nice heads up since most of the trail is almost perfect. The only thing this trail lacks is adequate scenery. It is mostly wooded with some views of the rivers and wet lands, but in my opinion to far and in between.\n\nStop for an ice cream in Pepperell or ride to Ayer, go down town to the only sub and ice cream shop in town. It is 12 miles in each direction and riding with my wife who is a novice rider, we easily did each direction in one hour with no strain.\n\nOne of the best trails I have found in New England.\n\nI often take the children for rides along the NRRT. There are many great starting points along the 12 mile trail, but our favorite is to start at the trailhead in Hollis, NH. From there we ride down about two miles, where some wonderful locals have installed a coke machine and put out chairs and a recycle bin during bike season. The children (and I) find something magically incongruous about finding a coke machine out in what feels like deep woods (though there are private residences abutting the trail at this point behind the trees). From there we continue on past some beautiful views of the Nashua River. There are some neat mile markers left over from the 19th century rail road that ran through here from Worcester to Portsmouth, NH. There are also some side trails, including some well-suited for mountain biking, and many opportunities for geocaching. About five miles down the trail, you'll come to downtown Pepperell and Rail Trail Ice Cream, a frequent stop of ours. (There's also good parking there, if you'd like to start from Pepperell.) Just past downtown Pepperell are some lovely views of the dam and some good stones to sit on for a picnic, if you're so inclined. The trail then winds through the Cronin Reservation area and the J Harry Rich State Forest. Soon after, you pass through Groton, MA and you pass over Rte 119/Main Street on a former railroad bridge. Soon you'll come to the Station Avenue parking area, and if you venture up Station Ave a short way, you'll find pizza and other amenities in downtown Groton. The trail then heads on to Ayer, past some lovely wetlands, sometimes on both sides of the trail. And then you'll reach the terminus at Groton Street in downtown Ayer. Ride over to Main Street and its quaint wooden sidewalks and grab a bite to eat at one of several restaurants.\n\nThis is a nicely maintain trail and the paving is great for biking.\n\nMy only complaint is that it is a fairly boring ride, almost completely enshrouded in trees. This makes for a cool ride unless it is a hot hot day.\n\nVery little sun and not a lot the see unless you like looking a miles and miles of woods.\n\nOn the plus side, there are plenty of places to pick up the trail with easy parking. It is well maintained.\n\nAnd please anyone riding any trail, if you must ride 2-3 abreast be aware that there are other people on the trail and might be passing you. Don't act like it is a complete shock each and every time a rider comes from behind and alerts you \"on your left\". This goes for every trail.\n\nWe're a family with 2 little ones, ages 2 and 8 months, who love biking in their trailer with dad. We parked in Groton off of court street, there were plenty of parking spaces in the dirt lot, not overly busy for a weekend. Being right in the center of town proved helpful when we realized we forgot our water bottles at home! the trail seems pretty popular for families, lots of groups whizzed right past (with a friendly on-your-left). The path is wide enough for the traffic, we were never concerned. Our kiddos enjoyed watching the trees and river and there are plenty of spots to pull off for lunch or the ever-needed diaper change lol. And on top of it being a really well paved trail, they've even gone to the trouble to spray paint mark all the bumps, holes, and roots along the way so you have some notice before your little guys get jostled. The whole ride was well shaded, so even on a hot sunny day it's doable for kids. Check it out!\n\nThis is a wonderful trail for walking and biking. As one who bicycles this trail frequently I have read a lot of fellow bikers making comments about pedestrians not sharing the trail with bikers and not moving over so they could pass. Common courtesy always works best and I think you will find that with the measure of courtesy you measure out to others they will measure back to you. Most people don't know what \"On your left\" means and others may take offense to it as sounding like you are ordering them to move. I find an \"Excuse me please\" always works everytime. All people understand that and there is no room to take offense. Try saying \"Excuse me please\" the next time and you will find that everyone will promptly move for you. I speak from experience. Happy trails!!!\n\nThis trail is my regular weekend ride and it provides a nice scenic experience with minimal road crossings. I tend to go very early in the morning to avoid the pedestrian traffic. For the most part early joggers and walkers I encounter are pretty good about following the rules, however, there are the occasional folks who still think it's a road and run or walk on the left side which keeps you guessing until you have to slow down and make sure they are not going to switch sides.\n\nI start at the Nashua trailhead as I live in Southern NH, this provides a nice parking area and gets you the additional mileage north of the Tyngsboro (DCR) lot.\n\nSome mornings after I reach the end in Ayer I will continue on and take West\n\nMain St. to the former Ft. Devens entrance and ride around Rogers Field and loop back via Macpherson/Bishop/Park St.\n\nThe only reason I am giving this trail 4 out of 5 stars is that it could use some upkeep/surface repair and at least one more restroom on the Northern section in Nashua or Tyngsboro.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nI agree with (Great Trail's) comment about the people that walk or ride 3 to 4 abreast. No matter how loud you say,\" on your left \", they seem to be bothered by your presence.\n\nWith that off my chest, this trail is a great way to get in a fun 25 mile ride.\n\nMy wife and I ride this trail every Sat. and Sunday during spring, summer, and fall.\n\nParking at the Ayer side fills in quick on the weekend. During the week, it is almost impossible to find a spot. We have found the Ayer lot totally filled during the week however,\n\nonly a few people on the trail itself. I would guess to say people that work in downtown Ayer park there for work. It is a bit frustrating when you take a day off to ride. Oh well. You can do what we do and park in the Nashua Lot.\n\nAll in all. Great Trail for a Great Ride!!!\n\nDid 15miles on this trail yesterday (Ayer to the ice-cream shop and back!) with my husband and 2 kids (10 and14), it goes through beautiful scenery and the trail is in good condition, any bumps are clearly marked so that you can avoid them if you are on a road bike. nice mix of people on the trail: families, roller bladers, serious and casual cyclists. There is ample parking in Ayer. Only one note of caution, as this was a Sunday the trail was quite busy at times and although most people were very courteous when they overtook my younger daughter and I, there were some people going too fast. One person even overtook us on the right, nearly taking out my daughter. We were riding in single file, well over to the right of the trail. If you want to cycle really fast I'd suggest going somewhere else or choosing a quieter time of day. That being said, it was still a nice safe place to cycle, we are hoping to return soon to do the New Hampshire end of the trail.\n\nTo whom it may concern...a huge thanks to the cities of Nashua, Ayer, Groton, Dunstable...for the first time I had the chance to ride the Nashua River Rail Trail ((4x) this week) I was completly blown away by how well the trail is maintained. THANKS A MILLION!!! I feel like I just found a hidden gem 35 minutes from my house...my only regret is not knowing about this trail sooner, as I have lived in NH for 10 years! I will ride this trail \"many\" times in the near future...I can't wait!\n\nMy only small complaint is the lack of \"trail etiquette\", I ride at about 15mph on average and had to come to complete stop on several occasions because people were walking or biking two or three wide and not paying attention to my very loud verbal signal \"ON YOUR LEFT\"...remember people, we pass on the left, and once we pass, we move to the far right side of the trail. If you must ride in parallel be aware of riders coming on your left. Other than my one complaint, I give this trail 5-stars...its even better than the Minuteman Trail, and I ride that trail 75x a year and love it.\n\nThank you,\n\nD. Urlaub\n\nI have been biking and rollerblading the Nashua River Trail for a few years now, from Ayer to Pepperell and back. Over the years I have seen it become more crowded, which is overall great that the trails are getting so much use and becoming popular.\n\nI appreciate that this is a family time, a very safe place for kids to ride their bikes.\n\nAs one, who is likely biking twice as fast as your child, and likely faster than most adults, I would appreciate the same courtesies to be shown to me, as you would expect me to show to you and your family.\n\nIt is a luxury to ride side by side, please be courteous if someone is trying to pass you. Slowing down, is not allowing space, it just means I catch up to you faster.\n\nMove to the right, does not mean if you were on the left, move to the middle, it means move the right, so someone can safely pass you.\n\nThis weekend I got caught up, emotionally, and yelled at someone as I passed them. They were the 4th person/ group of people, who I had to yell \"On your left\" multiple times, each one with a bit more edge than the time before, before they even acknowledged someone was behind them.\n\nAt one time a 6 or 7 year old child, riding with his family, was riding directly at me. I am riding around 15mph - if you see someone coming towards your child, have them move over as soon as you see someone approaching. These parents said nothing to their child- despite me waving my hand and yelling at him to move over multiple times. And yes, I did slow down. I should not have had to. Please be responsible.\n\nI don't want to have to be rude, please don't give me reason to. If there are 4 of you, please stay to the right. If you are talking you will not hear me come up behind you.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings and let each of us enjoy the rail trail at our own pace!\n\nThis is a beautiful trail, especially this time of year. I highly recommend it for biking, rollerblading and families.\n\nTo eric 87,\" there\" Some good dog owners such as myself walk on the right edge of the trail with my dog to the right of me on the grass. My dog has never gone near a bike. If there are bad dog owners on the trail then they should not be there. Sometimes I wish there was a cop on the trail. There is a huge difference between jerks with agressive dogs and people with well trained house pets. I don't know what you \"heard\" but whenever I have walked or biked the trail I have had the most trouble with people on bikes thinking they owned the trail. Even if I walk without my dog I have almost been hit by people trying to ride three across. The trail is for everyone and we all need to be mindful of who is there. If a dog runs in front of a bike then the dog owner should be sued for a hefty amount. Good dog owners such as myself have no tolerance for bad ones.\n\nI biked the Nashua R.R. Trail on Monday June 30th. Three trees were across the trail and were being taking care of by a local crews. :)\n\nWe parked at the communiter parking lot in Ayer and was lucky to find a space. When we returned from our ride, a police officer was giving out parking tickets ($15.00) to cars that were not in parking spaces. Also the officer told us that people were complaining about cars parking on side streets and the cars were also getting a $15.00 ticket. I asked the officer where to park when the lot was full. He suggested downtown behind some of the business by the RR tracks? I would suggest that people look at a map and find other parking lots along the trail. The rest of the lots only have one or two cars in them and their is plenty of spaces. Their is another parking lot by Dunkin Donuts but that one is usually full also.\n\nGood Luck...\n\nMarilyn Drisko\n\n\"In my opinion this is the best rail trail in eastern Massachusetts:\n\n1) The trail is only a few years old so the surface is in excellent condition;\n\n2) Because it is some distance from Boston and relatively little known compared to the Minuteman Rail Trail or Cape Cod Rail Trail it remains uncrowded even on the nicest summer weekends;\n\n3) It runs through a much less developed and more scenic area than the region's other major rail trails.\n\nSome scenic highlights include the large pond and beaver dam at mile 2.0 in Groton; the areas where the trail passes through the Rich State Forest around mile 5.0 to 6.5 in Groton (with unpaved side trails, courtesy of the Groton Conservation Commission); the section that parallels the Nashua River from mile 6.5 to 7.5 in Pepperell; and the crossing of the Unquetynasset Brook in Dunstable at mile 10.0. The trail also passes several horse farms and an orchard.\n\nI personally find the northern end of the trail much more attractive and uncrowded than the southern end. The trail is most densely wooded and shady in Dunstable and Pepperell (better for hot summer days); the vegetation is scrubbier near Ayer and the landscape is dominated in several spots by large arrays of power lines.\n\nThere is a slight uphill grade as you travel from the northern end of the trail, at the Dunstable MA/Nashua NH border, to the southern end at Ayer. For this reason, as well as the fact that Ayer offers public restroom facilities and places to get food, I think it's best to start from the trail's northern terminus, so you can stop to recharge at Ayer and then head back northward.\n\nI'm so glad to live near this gem of a trail! It's a real perk for anyone who lives in northern Massachusetts or southern New Hampshire.\"\n\n\"Be advised if you plan to park your car in the large parking lot near the beginning of the Nashua River Rail Trail in Ayer:\n\nWith the growing popularity of both the rail trail and the T-station, this lot often gets completely full.\n\nUnfortunately, people are starting to park on the grass, in the walkways and in the handicapped spaces, which is ultimately going to attract the wrong kind of attention to this trail.\n\nOn weekdays, many T commuters park in this lot all day, so parking spaces don't open up until around 5:30 PM or later.\n\nStreet parking on Rt. 111 is often available (before the bank at the corner), but there is a 2-hour limit (good for most trail users, bad for commuters).\n\nOn evenings and weekends, you can often park in the bank parking lot (on Rt. 111, at the corner) as long as the bank isn't open (there are numerous \"\"for bank customers only\"\" signs), or on the street.\n\nAlternatively, there is almost always plenty of space in the unpaved parking area next to the trail near Groton center (at Broadmeadow Road).\"\n\n\"Excellent trail. We ride the Pepperell to Ayer section nearly every weekend. Nice options for extensions into Devens (mirror lake rec. area is great for swimming on hot days) - or even into the Ox Bow National Wildlife refuge via underpass below Rt 2. Take dirt roads through the OB NWR to far side and exit (up long hill) to town of Still River. This is only a short distance from the Fruitlands Shaker Museum in Harvard, a great destination. Continue to Rt. 110 back to traffic circle (rt 2A) in Ayer then back!\n\nThe commuter rail station in Ayer provides many other options (and you can take you bike on the train too - except at rush hour).\n\nThe Dunstable end isn't far from the Pepperel Airport & jump center. Go straight ahead on the original rail line when the paved trail turns right to the parking lot at the dunstable end. Follow dirt path to Rt 111A, left on 111A, left on 111 (towards pepperell), cross river, airport about a mile (or so) on left. It's very active (continuous parachute activity) on nice spring/summer/fall weekends.\n\nThe rail trail itself is becoming more popular which means more CROWDED on nice weekend days. Unfortunately, people operate on the rail trail much the same as they do on the roads around here, too often rude, arogant & danerous.\n\nBe careful & enjoy this great asset to the area!\"\n\n\"I'm excited about this trail, mostly because it starts and ends a mile away form my house. I saw a deer yesterday right at the Hollis line as I was showing it to someone else. The trail is smooth as glass and has almost no hills the entire way. There are some great mountain biking trails to the right or left at different parts of the trail that tend to reconnect to the trail at later points.\n\nYou may be lucky and catch the beaver swimming about in a nearby swamp in the town of Groton. I also saw 2 wild turkeys early one morning. Roux's Market in Ayer offers 25 cent Ice Cream and is a great place to catch a snack. The Bike Shop has two stores right off of the trail in Ayer and Pepperel if you need to pick up some emergency equipment.\""
