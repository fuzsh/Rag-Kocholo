        "text": "Major changes are hitting the Orange, Red, and several Commuter Rail lines.\n\nSome MBTA service will once again screech to a halt as more construction is planned for the month of June.\n\nThe repair work will impact the Orange Line, Red Line, and several Commuter Rail lines. Here’s what to know:\n\nOrange Line\n\nThe Orange Line will be down between Wellington and Back Bay from May 28 to June 6 all day, every day. Shuttle service will be available from Wellington to North Station, but riders will be expected to use the Green Line from North Station to Back Bay.\n\nA handful of downtown Orange Line stations will be completely closed with no shuttle service: Tufts Medical Center, Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, State, and Haymarket.\n\nBeginning at 8:45 p.m. on Friday, June 7, and continuing all day throughout the weekend (June 8-9), the Orange Line will be down between Oak Grove and North Station. Comparable service will be available if riders take the Haverhill Commuter Rail Line, but the train will only stop at Oak Grove, Malden Center, and North Station. For riders seeking another stop, shuttle buses will be available.\n\nThe shuttle bus will make all stops between Oak Grove and North Station.\n\nFares are free on the Haverhill Line with limited stops. However, the Haverhill Line will run under a special Construction Schedule throughout the summer starting May 20.\n\nFrom June 22-30, all day and every day, the Orange Line will be down between Wellington and North Station. Similar to the earlier June shutdowns, the Haverhill Line has a few comparable stops at Oak Grove, Malden Center, and North Station as an alternative to a shuttle bus.\n\nThe shuttle bus will make all stops between Wellington and North Station.\n\nFree fares will be available at Wellington and North Station.\n\nRed Line\n\nThe Red Line will shut down on the first and last weekends of the month between Alewife and Harvard (June 1-2 and June 29-30). Shuttle buses will make all stops between Alewife and Harvard. The MBTA offers a few alternative routes as well:\n\nBus Route 77 will be fare-free.\n\nThe Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line will be fare-free between Porter and North Station. Beyond Porter, regular fares resume.\n\nTwo more weekends will also be impacted. During the weekends of June 8-9 and June 15-16, the Red Line will be down between Broadway and Braintree. These changes do not impact the Ashmont branch between JFK/UMass and Ashmont.\n\nShuttle bus service will be available between Broadway and Braintree for all stations.\n\nRiders can also utilize the Commuter Rail express shuttle bus to go directly from South Station to Braintree for the Greenbush, Kingston, and Middleborough/Lakeville Commuter Rail lines.\n\nBeginning at 8:45 p.m. on Friday, June 28, and continuing all-day throughout the weekend (June 29-30), the outbound/northbound station of Kendall/MIT will be completely closed.\n\nIf you are traveling outbound and need to stop at Kendall/MIT, the MBTA instructs riders to go an additional stop to Central and then take an inbound train back to Kendall/MIT. If you are traveling outbound starting from Kendall/MIT, the MBTA instructs riders to take the train inbound to Charles/MGH and then transfer to the outbound platform.\n\nTo clarify, outbound trains will completely bypass the Kendall/MIT platform.\n\nFare gates will be open at Central inbound for a free transfer.\n\nCommuter Rail\n\nThe Kingston, Middleborough, and Greenbush Commuter Rail lines run adjacent to the Red Line. Thus, they will also be impacted by the construction. An express bus is available during the weekends of June 8-9 and June 15-16 to replace service between South Station and Braintree.\n\nAn express bus will take riders directly between Braintree and South Station. No stops will be made in between.\n\nRegular Commuter Rail fares will be collected between Kingston, Middleborough, Greenbush, and Braintree stations.\n\nThe Needham Commuter Rail Line will be suspended between Needham Heights and South Station during the weekends of June 1-2 and June 8-9. Additionally, the same stops will be impacted all day, every day from June 28-July 1.\n\nBus Routes 35, 36, 37, and 59 will be fare-free.\n\nFree shuttle bus service will be available between Needham Heights and Newton Highlands on the Green Line (D branch).\n\nFree shuttle bus service will be available between Needham Heights and Forest Hills on the Orange Line.\n\nRiders can show their June mTicket for access to the Green Line at Needham Heights and the Orange Line at Forest Hills.\n\nThe Kingston Commuter Rail Line will be down between Kingston and Halifax stations during the weekend of June 22-23. A free shuttle bus will operate between these two stations.\n\nThe Haverhill Commuter Rail Line will be under a special construction schedule beginning May 20 through the end of the summer. Mid-day inbound trains will operate express from Ballardville to North Station."
