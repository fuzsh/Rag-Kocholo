        "text": "Located in the scenic White Mountains of New Hampshire, a trip on the Cafe Lafayette Dinner Train offers something totally different. Featuring a two hour train ride complete with a 5 course dinner aboard 1950's restored vintage rail cars, the Cafe Lafayette Dinner Train is a dining experience of a lifetime.\n\nThe Trip: The Cafe Lafayette travels 20 miles along the Pemi River Valley, on a historic timberline dating back to the early 1800's. Once aboard, we head south from our train station in North Woodstock, through the woods, over 3 trestle bridges, through the Jack-O-Lantern golf course, and a Christmas tree farm in Thornton. We then return on the same line back to our train station in North Woodstock."
