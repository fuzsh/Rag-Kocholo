We cannot admit walk-ins if at capacity.\n\nPlease note: Members can reserve tickets up to 14 days prior to their visit, non-members up to 10 days prior.\n\nReserve Tickets\n\nAdmission Prices\n\nYou can reserve tickets online in advance; you will be charged admission when you arrive. If you have a coupon, free pass, corporate admission benefit, pre-purchased ticket, library pass, EBT or WIC benefits, or any other discount to apply, please present it to the Admissions staff when you check in and the discount will be applied to the cost of your visit.\n\nONE Price for Discovery Museum and Discovery Woods\n\nAdult: $17.00\n\nSenior (60+): $16.00\n\nChild: $17.00\n\nUnder 1 year old: Free\n\nTeachers are always free!\n\nMembers: FREE\n\nLearn More\n\nWays to Save\n\nReservations Recommended\n\nAll visitors—including members—should make a reservation for a specific day and time prior to coming to the Museum campus; you must check into the Museum within one hour of your reservation time, and may stay as long as you like. We cannot admit walk-ins if at capacity. Your reservation only valid for the date and time you selected.\n\nPayment for your visit, minus any applicable discounts, will be taken when you arrive.\n\nOn-site ticket purchases will only be available if the Museum is not at capacity.\n\nIf you are unable to reserve your tickets online, please call us at 978-264-4200 to reserve your tickets by phone.\n\nFacilities\n\nThere is a museum building and an outdoor nature playscape on our campus; Discovery Museum and Discovery Woods are both accessible and are for all ages. Discovery Museum combines the best exhibits—beautifully reimagined and redesigned using Universal Design principles—from the former Science Discovery Museum and Children's Discovery Museum into one building. There are also a number of outdoor exhibits spread throughout our 4.5 acre campus, and a trailhead to 180 acres of Great Hill conservation land. And, of course, Bessie the dinosaur graces our lawn.\n\nRisk\n\nChildren should be adequately supervised by responsible adults at all times.\n\nDiscovery Woods is an outdoor museum exhibit about nature play and choosing to take “just right” risks.\n\nAdult supervision by you helps kids make choices that are right for their age and ability. It is ok for kids to decide that an activity might be for “next time” they come.\n\nCode of Conduct\n\nOur mission is to spark delight in learning by igniting curiosity and creativity. We appreciate your support in helping us uphold this mission by making the shared experience at the Museum a positive one for all. While on our campus, we require all visitors to adhere to our Code of Conduct.\n\nChange of Clothes? Shoes??\n\nThere are waterproof smocks available in our Water Gallery. But, exploration of the properties of water can sometimes result in some wet clothing. You might consider bringing a change of clothes for your young scientist, or visiting the Water Gallery at the end of your visit rather than at the beginning.\n\nIf your child uses a hearing device such as hearing aids or a cochlear implant, you may want to bring a water-resistant cover for them for your time spent in our Water Gallery.\n\nAll visitors that walk must wear shoes at all times.\n\nNo Smoking\n\nSmoking of any kind, including tobacco, marijuana, vaping, juuling, or any other e-cigarette, is prohibited throughout the entire campus, including Discovery Woods.\n\nSmile!\n\nDuring your visit you may be photographed and/or videotaped by our staff for marketing purposes. If you prefer not to be, please tell us at the Admissions desk. We will happily provide stickers to your party so that we know to avoid you with our cameras.\n\nCommunity Collections\n\nWe collect non-perishable food donations for the Acton Food Pantry and Open Table year-round; a collection bin is in our lobby. Please consider bringing a donation if you are able.\n\nLet It Snow!\n\nNew England weather can be unpredictable! There may be snow or ice on the Discovery Woods path, so please wear appropriate footwear and walk carefully. And please, dress your children for the weather—they may want to play outside longer than you anticipate!\n\nAccessibility\n\nWe welcome visitors of all ability and mobility levels and will work with you or your group to accommodate any special needs. Please visit our Accessibility page to learn more about our accessibility features and resources, and our Especially for Me page to learn about our year-round access events.\n\nVisitors may not be accompanied by dogs except for registered service dogs. Service dogs are permitted in the museum building and Discovery Woods.\n\nChanging Areas\n\nAll five restrooms in the building include changing tables.\n\nEating and Drinking\n\nPlease use designated areas for snacking; food is not permitted in the galleries. Outdoor tables are available for use on our patio as weather permits (they have table umbrellas but are not covered). Water fountains and bottle fillers are available inside the Museum. Snacks and drinks can be purchased from a vending machine located in the Discovery Store in our lobby; we do not have a cafe.\n\nInfant Feeding/Nursing\n\nA private Care and Feeding Corner is located in the Brain Building Together exhibit on the second floor. It is equipped with a dimmable light, glider chair, and outlet. A bottle warmer and sink are available nearby.\n\nAdult Supervision\n\nAdults must be in the same exhibit room with their children at all times. Children are not permitted to enter or leave the buildings or Discovery Woods without an adult.\n\nUnaccompanied Adults\n\nWe ask that any adults who wish to visit the Museum without a child leave a photo ID at our Admissions desk.\n\nParking\n\nThere is a one-way flow through our parking lot; please observe all signs. Please park only in designated spaces to keep the lot safe for pedestrians, buses, and emergency vehicle access.\n\nIf meeting friends at the Museum, please consider carpooling rather than bringing multiple cars.\n\nHandicap spots are available near the rear of the building.\n\nParking is free.\n\nCarbon Offset Fee Program\n\nA 50 cent opt-out carbon offset fee per visitor group will be added to admissions transactions to mitigate the environmental impact of travel to and from the Museum (free or $1 discount admission is exempt in most cases and will be covered by the Museum). Discovery Museum also covers the carbon offset fees for all staff and volunteers.\n\nFor members, a $1 opt-out carbon offset fee to mitigate the impact of your travel is part of your annual membership payment. For more information on how this program works and what environmental project we support with the fees, please see this program overview.\n\nDiscovery Store\n\nThe Discovery Store has books, puzzles, science kits, craft supplies, and more. Members save 10% in the store!\n\nGroup Visits\n\nPlease email kwatt [at] discoveryacton.org (Kathie Watt) for more information about Field Trips or other group visits.\n\nCleaning\n\nThe Museum is professionally cleaned with CDC-recommended products each night after closing, including disinfecting all high-touch areas including door handles, knobs, elevator buttons, and stair rails.\n\nStaff disinfect high-touch areas throughout the day using CDC-recommended products, and also sanitize gallery manipulatives at the end of each day.\n\nAir Handling\n\nDiscovery Museum’s air handling system specifications have been provided by industry professionals and reviewed by Town officials. Based on that we understand that our air exchange rate is more than sufficient for our building capacity. The Museum’s air handling system provides for air flow at 11,275 cubic feet per minute (CFM), allowing for an occupancy just over 1,500 people. Museum HVAC systems are MERV-13 rated air filters.\n\nNeed Help?\n\nJust ask! Our Explorer staff members are here to support your museum experience. They can be identified by their name tags and the purple aprons worn in the Museum and purple aprons or blue jackets worn in Discovery Woods.\n\nOur address: 177 Main Street (Route 27) Acton, MA 01720\n\nBessie the Dinosaur graces our our front yard; the Museum is up the parking lot past Bessie, and not always directly visible from the street.\n\nParking is FREE!\n\nFind us on Google Maps\n\nDriving Directions\n\nFrom Route 95/128\n\nTake Exit 45B (old exit number 29B) onto Route 2 West toward Acton/Fitchburg.
