Passenger Rail Commission Overview\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nRail Improvements Economic Impact Study (2020 – 2021)\n\nThe Capitol Region Council of Governments [in Hartford CT] and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission completed a study of the economic benefits of that would result from two sets of proposed passenger rail improvements — finishing the Hartford Line and connecting it to Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nThe report projects between $47 and $84 billion in new regional Gross Domestic Product over 30 years would result from the $6 to $9 billion rail investment.\n\nRail Improvements Economic Impact Study (archived)\n\nCapitol Region Council of Governments\n\nMetro Hartford-Springfield Passenger Rail Economic Impact Report Briefing (31m 42s)\n\nvia YouTube | May 6, 2021\n\nEast-West Passenger Rail Study (2018 – 2021)\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) completed a study examining the feasibility of expanded passenger rail service between Boston, Springfield and Pittsfield, with the speed, frequency, and reliability necessary to be a competitive option for travel along this corridor.\n\nEast–West Passenger Rail Study (Official webpage)\n\nMassDOT\n\nEast–West Passenger Rail Study Overview\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nRegional Transportation Plan updates (2020)\n\nPioneer Valley Regional Transportation Plan Update\n\nFranklin County Regional Transportation Plan Update\n\nRail Vision (2019)\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) conducted a two year study study to identify the most cost effective strategies for leveraging the MBTA’s extensive rail network to increase ridership and better meet the transportation and economic growth needs of the Greater Boston region.\n\nThe study will identified possible service alternatives, including longer distance service Regional Rail services that potentially could include service extensions beyond the traditional MBTA commuter rail service area.\n\nThe Massachusetts State Rail Plan examines changes to the network and services since the original state rail plan was released in 2010, as well as trends that have arisen since that time. The plan documents the state rail system and planned improvements, and outline the Commonwealth’s 20-year vision and a four-year plan for the statewide rail system.\n\nPalmer Transit Oriented Development Study (2017)\n\nFollowing the inclusion of station in Palmer in the Northern New England Intercity Rail Initiative study, the Palmer Redevelopment Authority commissioned Chris Ferrero and Jon Allard of Fuss & O’Neill to prepare a preliminary transit-oriented development plan focused on a passenger rail stop in downtown Palmer.\n\nThe Palmer Transit Oriented Development Draft Conceptual Downtown Plan enumerates the economic benefits of locating this passenger rail stop in Palmer’s Depot Village. The plan also demonstrates the viability of locating rail platforms at this location to take full advantage of Palmer as a regional crossroads on the Inland Route and Central Corridor rail lines. This rail junction is within a mile of Exit 8 on the Massachusetts Turnpike and the intersection of U.S. Route 20 and Mass. Routes 32 and 181.\n\nPalmer TOD Draft Conceptual Downtown Plan presentation (PDF)\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nCentral Corridor Passenger Rail Feasibility Study (PDF) | 2017\n\nThe Central Corridor Line Passenger Rail Feasibility Study examined the implementation and operation of an intercity passenger rail service along the Central Corridor. The Central Corridor Line connects the cities of Brattleboro, Vermont to New London, Connecticut via the New England Central Railroad Palmer Division line south.\n\nNEC FUTURE Plan | 2017\n\nNEC FUTURE is the Federal Railroad Administration’s comprehensive plan for improving the Northeast Corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston, MA. The plan creates a framework for the future investments needed to improve passenger rail capacity and service through 2040.\n\nNorthern New England Intercity Rail Initiative | 2016\n\nThis study, which is often referred to as the NNEIRI Study, examines the opportunities and impacts of more frequent and higher speed intercity passenger rail service on two major rail corridors known as the Inland Route (New Haven-Springfield-Boston) and the Boston to Montreal Route.\n\nNNEIRI Study Information\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nMassachusetts Regional Bus Study | 2013\n\nThis study analyzes the changes since 1980 in the regional bus services (both intrastate and interstate) that operate within Massachusetts, identifies the reasons for the changes, and examines how these regional services relate to local rail and bus services.\n\nMarket Analysis of the Knowledge Corridor Study (PDF) | 2012\n\nThis study looks at the market potential for transit-oriented development (TOD) along the Knowledge Corridor rail lines. The study identifies the economic development benefits of transit, discusses the drivers of TOD demand nationally, and provides an introduction to concepts of real estate economics, in order to provide a context for the regional market study.\n\nHolyoke Station Feasibility Study and Site Analysis (PDF) | 2011\n\nThis study was prepared to evaluate the options for a new passenger rail station in the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nThe study also examined the feasibility of providing a passenger rail stop in Holyoke as part of the restoration of passenger rail service on the route that passes through the City.\n\nMassachusetts State Rail Plan (PDF) | 2010\n\nKnowledge Corridor Feasibility Study (PDF) | 2009\n\nThis study was prepared to assess the feasibility of possible future passenger rail improvements to reduce travel time, maximize accessibility, and provide viable transportation alternatives within the Knowledge Corridor.\n\nBoston-Western Corridor High-Speed Transportation Market Feasibility Study (1973)\n\nThe only known public copy of the study is in the UMass Amherst main library.\n\nOther studies\n\nThis section includes a few recent studies from outside of western Mass that we found to be of particular interest.\n\nMA/NH | Nashua-Manchester (Capitol Corridor) Commuter Rail project\n\nAn effort to extend MBTA Commuter Rail service from Lowell to southern New Hampshire, with proposed station stops in Nashua (2 stops), Bedford and Manchester.\n\nOfficial project website\n\nNew Hampshire Department of Transportation\n\nCT | Southeast to Danbury Rail Link Feasibility Study (2021-2022)\n\nThe Southeast, NY to Danbury, CT Rail Link Feasibility Study evaluated the restoration of passenger rail service on the southern Beacon Line, an approximate 11-mile rail corridor between the Southeast and/or Brewster Stations on the MTA Metro-North Railroad’s Harlem Line in New York and the Danbury Station on the State of Connecticut/Metro-North Danbury Line in Connecticut.\n\nOfficial study webpage\n\nNew York Metropolitan Transportation Council\n\nReports\n\nTowards a Passenger Station on the East-West Massachusetts Train Line: The Case for Palmer (PDF)\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst, Center for Economic Development, UMass Design Center | 2019\n\nLong-Distance Commuting in the Boston Region: Necessity or “Strategic Mobility Choice”?
