        "text": "445 Lowell St – Haggett Station Depot\n\nThe Lowell - Lawrence Rail Road line was built in 1847-1848 from Tewksbury to the new city of Lawrence. Lawrence was established in 1845 on the Merrimack River by annexing land from Andover on the south and Methuen on the north side of the river. The great dam was constructed at the falls just west of the Andover Bridge and canals dug along the banks to deliver water power to the mills.\n\nAt this time only the Boston to Lowell Railroad and the Andover–Wilmington Rail line to Haverhill were in operation. The lines would merge to become the Boston and Maine Railroad. To service the rapidly growing city the Andover line was relocated to connect to Lawrence in 1848. A spur line off the Lowell line cut through Tewksbury and West Parish in Andover to connect to the central station in Lawrence.\n\nAndover Advertiser, May 14, 1869 - A Target station has been established on the Lowell & Lawrence Railroad, near the William place, in West Andover. A published photo from the collection of the Beverly Historical Society states 1866 as the date it was built.\n\nThe station at Haggett’s Pond served as a stop for summer visitors to Bailey’s Grove on the pond, a popular picnic ground. Ice house also dotted the shore line on the west side of the pond. Ice could be shipped out to the cities faster and in larger quantities.\n\nThe station also provided transportation for students attending Punchard High School on Bartlet Street in Andover Center. They would travel to Lawrence then switch to a train back to Andover Depot. In the 1890’s a Trolley car could also be used from Lawrence down Main St in Andover.\n\nRidership dropped on this line after WWI in part due to automobile ownership. Aug.15, 1924 Andover Townsman - pg. 4. Haggetts Pond Train Discontinued.\n\nThe Haggetts Station was located on the north side of Lowell Street and the line ran along the west side of the Seth Chase farm that stood on the site at 38 Haggetts Pond Road. After Chase died his daughters sold the property to the American Woolen Company in 1923. William M. Wood, President of the A.W.Co., purchased several farms in West Andover as part of his development plan of Shawsheen Village. The farms were to provide milk, eggs and produce for the residents of the village. Mr. Wood died in February 1926 and the land holdings were sold off that summer.\n\nGeorge M. Hunter purchased the Chase property on Aug. 10, 1926 and the parcel contained 8.23 acres extending from Lowell St. to Haggetts Pond Rd. George worked for the American Woolen Co. as a Manager of their bag and burlap mill in Lawrence. He lived at #440 Lowell Street with his bride Beatrice (Monroe) Hunter and in 1920 also owned #442 and #444 Lowell Street.\n\nGeorge Matthew Hunter was born June 28, 1873 in Lawrence, son of John & Marion Maria (Colquhoun) Hunter, both Scottish immigrants. George was the youngest of three children to John and Marion, two brothers; John W. b. July 18, 1866 d. Sept. 28, 1873 and Alexander b. 1868. His mother Marion died on Feb. 23, 1875. The 1880 census lists George Hunter age 7, as adopted son, living with his grandfather John Colquhoun age 75 and his two children, Alexander age 25 a butcher and Elizabeth age 28 mill worker. George would continue to live with his Aunt Elizabeth Colquhoun. In 1900 they had moved to Andover and rented at 234 Main St. George is an upholsterer. George later went to work for the American Woolen Co., lived in Methuen. The 1920 Census lists George on (#444) Lowell St., age 45, with his Aunt Elizabeth now 75.\n\nGeorge married on June 21, 1922 to Beatrice Elizabeth Monroe b. Aug. 12, 1895 in Bradford, MA dau. of Joseph W. & Grace Jane (McGillivray) Monroe.\n\nWe believe the Haggetts Pond Depot was part of the 8.25 acre parcel and moved by George to 48 Haggetts Pond Rd in 1927. The old station was converted into cottage home and in 1930 Andrew Kerr Innes, wife Grace I., and three children are renting the home. Grace Innes was the sister of Bernice Hunter. George died on Dec. 22, 1928 and Bernice inherited the property. She remained in the home at 440 Lowell St and sold the Station house Andrew K. & Grace Innes on Oct. 30, 1943."
