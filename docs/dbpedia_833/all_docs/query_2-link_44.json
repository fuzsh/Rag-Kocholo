        "text": "For New Hampshire residents, there are two main ways to travel to Boston; buses from Manchester, Concord, or Londonderry, or driving their own cars. Both options can be time-consuming, expensive, and impractical, especially for daily commutes. Since the 1980s, there have been increasing calls to revive a long-lost third option; commuter rail.\n\nHistorically, many New Hampshire towns maintained passenger rail services. Prior to World War I, there were over one-thousand miles of commuter rail crisscrossing the state. As the century progressed, many rail lines were shut down as the United States became more car dependent. Currently, New Hampshire has roughly four-hundred miles of rail that is in use, mainly for freight purposes.\n\nThe proposal that has garnered the most support from the public, as well as elected officials, is the so-called Capital Corridor project. This proposal is simple: it involves extending an MBTA line that currently terminates in Lowell to one of the following cities: Nashua, Manchester, or Concord. A state-sponsored study concluded the best options would be Nashua or Manchester. All three options would continue the bus services from various New Hampshire locations to Boston as currently practiced. A Lowell to Nashua rail would be the cheapest option, while a Lowell to Concord would be the most costly. Expanding the rail to Concord also increases the number of expected passengers.\n\nOpponents argue the price tag that comes with the project, reaching two-hundred million dollars in some estimates, as more than enough reason to not pursue this undertaking. This price tag may look large at first glance, but the benefits of expanding commuter rail are not only worth the price, but they also outweigh the potential negatives.\n\nThe commuter rail solves what was once an unsolvable problem: traffic. New Hampshireâ€™s highways become parking lots every weekend, holiday, and weekday afternoon. Anyone who has been unfortunate enough to be trapped in the endless sea of cars knows this issue all too well. Opponents of expanding commuter rail point to the different forms of transportation already used as a perfectly fine alternative. It is true that alternative transportation exists, but not to the scale required to alleviate the traffic. Reliable high-speed commuter rail is the solution to this age-old problem. With a steady alternative route, many commuters who choose to drive now would use this new option for a variety of reasons, ranging from ease of access to cost.\n\nA commuter rail also has the potential to send large positive shockwaves throughout the economies of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. With this new transportation system increasing the flow of people between the two states, both states would see increases in many categories, namely population, jobs, and available housing. Estimates from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation place the amount of new housing and jobs between two thousand and three thousand.\n\nThe new commuter rail would also decrease noise and environmental pollution. With the many highways traversing the state, New Hampshire creates significant pollution from car exhausts. These cars also create noise pollution in otherwise quiet cities and towns. A commuter rail solves both of these problems by decreasing the number of cars on New Hampshire roads and highways in a way no other type of transportation system can.\n\nNew Hampshire deserves a solution to all these problems that have plagued it for too long. We deserve a proven solution that works. New Hampshire had commuter rail decades ago, but, now that demographics have changed, there is a great opportunity that should be seized to bring it back. A commuter rail benefits everyone and harms nobody. The increase in tax revenue, increase in housing units, and increase in the number of available jobs all make the case for a commuter rail. The only negative is the price tag, but it is a price we can afford. Cities, states, and the federal government all spend more than what bringing the commuter rail to the Granite State would cost numerous times over every year on trivial matters.\n\nStudies have been commissioned and completed, and they have found that a commuter rail would be an invaluable good done to the economy and the people of New Hampshire. The high-speed commuter rail is a modern twenty-first century transportation method that deserves support."
