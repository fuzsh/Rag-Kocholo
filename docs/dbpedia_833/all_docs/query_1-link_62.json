        "text": "A second, very early railway, the Boston & Providence (1835) which features the Canton Viaduct in Canton, MA, had Capt William Gibbs McNeill as Chief Engineer. He was the brother of Anna Matilda McNeill Whistler, immortalized as \"Whistler's Mother\" by James A. McNeill Whistler; her and George's son.\n\nMaj. Whistler had also been Chief Engineer of the Boston & Lowell Railroad, the first railroad chartered in New England. This was an adjunct of the Lowell Locks & Canals Co. On the B&L, he built the first shops capable of manufacturing locomotives in New England.\n\nStone bridges were constructed only in the West Branch Gorge, a remote area where their durability insured limited maintenance, making them cost effective. Three of these bridges were abandoned 100 years ago and have stood without any maintenance whatsoever for all that time.\n\nWhen Whistler began work on the Western Railway project, in virtually the Paleolithic era of the industry, the only proven best practices and pre-existing standards to draw upon were those he had developed in his own career. At the time, America had no foundries capable of rolling rail and all rail used in construction of the Western was imported from England. Some lines were still laying strap rail (wood topped with metal strapping) during this period.\n\nThe Western Railroad was surveyed on horseback, by men who were writing the book on railroad engineering as they went. It is said they presented at least a half-dozen alternate routes for each segment upon return from their expeditions. Much of the surveying in the wilderness had to be done from towers built above the trees or at night with torches, in order to be able to spot the mark through the forest on adjoining hillsides.\n\nFarmers along the route leased horse and ox teams to the project to move the stone and displaced earth. Most walked the beasts to work daily, sometimes for many miles each way.\n\nAmong famous persons who passed over these Arches were Abe Lincoln, before he was president, Harry Truman, on a \"whistle-stop\" tour, and Charles Dickens who wrote in 1842, only a year after this railway opened, \"The train stops at stations in the woods, where the wild impossibility of anyone having the smallest reason to get out is only to be equaled by the apparently desperate hopelessness of there being anybody to get in.\"\n\nHis snobbery arose from the fact that Britain had invented railroads and theirs were much better established. He was clearly un-aware in the immediacy of history, that this road had launched America to the forefront of railway engineering, leaving Great Britain behind.\n\nMaj. Whistler built this rail line through some of the most forbidding wilderness the Berkshires had to offer, without dynamite, using picks, shovels and black powder; removing rock with ox teams and wooden wheelbarrows. He completed the project in 2\" years.\n\nThe abandoned Arches are a result of a re-alignment to ease two sharp curves. Out of 150 miles of innovative railroad, a correction of less than a mile reveals an amazing talent. The mountain section of the railroad consists of 13.89 miles and cost $980,000.00 or $70,000.00 per mile to build in 1841. Construction here slowed to a rate of 20 miles per year.\n\nBeyond the resistance factor present in all curvature, a 30 car train going 25 mph in 1841 would have had little trouble with the superseded curves. By 1910, when 100 car trains reached 65 mph, it became cost-effective to re-configure this small segment of Whistler's original survey. There was much wheel and rail wear here, and it forced trains to slow near the base of the hill. The recent addition of nitroglycerin to the contractors\" arsenal also made the adjustment more practicable.\n\nBy 1842, Whistler's reputation was beginning to spread around the world. Immediately after completion of the Western Railroad, summoned by Czar Nicholas I, Whistler left for Russia to construct their first railroad, now known as the October Railroad, from St. Petersburg to Moscow. The same man was responsible for initiating Russian eastward and U.S. westward railroad expansion!\n\nIt was in America that he encountered the most daunting obstacles geographically. In Russia, The grades and terrain were much less challenging and Whistler thought he would be gone for a couple years at most. Instead, he got bogged down by the politics of Czarist Russia, unrealistic and arbitrary standards, serf labor, and his own integrity, which wouldn\"t permit him to abandon the project due to hardship alone.\n\nMaj. Whistler died in Russia, on April 7, 1849 at the age of 49, after a long period of illness. Generally believed to have been caused by cholera, some historians claim it was a simple heart attack. Others, including his own son George William, completed the railroad after his passing.\n\nThe enigmatic Maj. Whistler had stood at the crossroads of history; between British and American eras, railroads and canals, cottage industry and the Industrial Revolution. He managed to insure American leadership in the Industrial Age but died in service to the Russian Empire.\n\nThe most destructive event in the history of the Arches was the flood of November 4, 1927 when the Ballou and the Silk Mill Dams of Becket both failed, sending a wall of water down the narrow valley. This catastrophe took out three Arches. It skipped some and leveled others. The roadbed and track were totally gone in places. The New York Central brought in crews from all over the system and they were able to open the line in eleven days.\n\nWalnut Hill Conservation Area is part of the largest roadless wilderness in the state. The Westfield River is Massachusetts's first National Wild & Scenic River, making the surroundings remarkably alluring and tranquil. They host a number of endangered and \"of concern\" species. For an appealing glimpse of these environs just as they are about to awake from a long winter, check out: You Tube / The Westfield Beneath the Arches.\n\n\"Whistler's Western\" was substantially built, despite its magnitude. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Keystone Arch Historic District, where up to 70 foot high bridges sit in silent testimony to the labors of the thousands of immigrants who constructed this line.\n\nThe standards of the Western Railway were set very high by Whistler. How high was largely unfathomable to supporters of the project, as there was little to compare them to. Investors pushed for a single-track line to save money, Whistler insisted on double. All cuts and bridges were built to double track width, though only a single track was initially laid.\n\nWithin a decade, traffic mandated the second track. Whistler's planning saved the road millions in expansion costs. He had a rare combination of business and scientific acumen. Project backers had insisted that the line could well follow the narrow crooked contours of the land to conserve capital. Thomas B. Wales, President of the corporation, convinced of the correctness of Whistler's vision, declared he would \"have nothing to do with such a tuppenny cow path.\"\n\nAfter the road opened to Chester, The Westfield News-Letter wrote: \"It is the last route in the world where we should ever dream of making a railroad.\" nonetheless it was judged to be \"one of the safest and best that we have passed over.\"\n\nThe Keystone Arches have surpassed all expectations of their builders. The examples still in use carry trains 30 times heavier than they were designed for. In 1840, a steam locomotive weighed about 12,000 lbs. The average locomotive of 2012 weighs in the neighborhood of 350,000 lbs.\n\nA combination of heroic feats of engineering, coupled with superb workmanship, resulted in one of the epochal moments in transportation history, yet remains one of the least celebrated in historic record. TRAINS Magazine called this \"the most underrated mountain crossing\".\n\nThe stats of The Western Railroad remain dominant even as subsequent Berkshire crossings, both rail and highway, were built. Whistler, using cut and fill methodology, never lost a foot of altitude as he pushed westward. All but one succeeding crossing utilized a summit higher than the Western.\n\nThe Fitchburg Railroad sought to lessen altitude through the use of a tunnel, but the technology of the time did not equal the vision. Digging the 5 mile long tunnel put the state of MA in the red deeper than did the 1990's \"Big Dig\". While it eventually crossed lower (836 ft. ASL) it delayed for 45 years opening that line. Not even begun until 20 years after the Western commenced operations, the tunnel took 25 years and the invention of nitro-glycerin to materialize.\n\nRapid access to the transportation revolution appears to have had more profound effects on local economies than those realized through fuel savings and reduced locomotive costs. Cities and towns along the tunnel route; North Adams, Greenfield and Fitchburg, never attained the size or status of locations like Worcester, Springfield or Pittsfield served by the earlier Western Railroad.\n\nIn 1910, The \"Huckleberry\" Trolley Line, designed for light rail, reached a height of about 1,700 ft crossing further south at Blandford, with some grades approaching 7%.\n\nBecket, Huntington and Chester are three hilltowns which, in addition to the world's first mountain railroad, play host to the world's first trans-mountain highway designed specifically for the automobile. This is Jacob's Ladder Trail, now U.S. 20, which crosses in Becket at 1,794 ft.\n\nThe Mass Turnpike, surveyed with helicopters in the 1950's, crosses the Berkshires at Blandford at 1,724 ft. ASL. Those civil engineers are said to have highly praised Whistler's work.\n\nThe Western Railroad represented a colossal technological leap for railroads, increasing their range, use, and influence. Phase II of railroad development was inaugurated by the Western. It unleashed an explosion of growth, which quickly surpassed the grades, bridges and all the rest which made the Western a superlative civil engineering achievement. Its stats were rapidly eclipsed by its spawn.\n\nSEQ CHAPTER \\h \\r 1In 1780, national visionary Thomas Jefferson predicted it would take until the year 2000 to settle all the land in the west. The only thing missing from his hypothesis was the railroad."
