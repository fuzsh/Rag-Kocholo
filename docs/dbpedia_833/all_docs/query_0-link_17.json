        "text": "Two sets regional railroad tracks run through Norwich today. The railroads are now solely used to transport cargo. The black outline shows the boundaries of Norwich. The New England Central tracks, shown as a red line, travel along the west side of the Thames River from New London through Norwich to Canada. The trains that run on these tracks are operated today by the New England Central Railroad which is a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming.\n\nThe Providence and Worcester tracks, shown as blue lines, run south from Norwich along the east side of the Thames River through New London on to Providence. The P&W track also runs north from Norwich to Plainfield. At Plainfield the tracks split, and continue on to either Worcester or Willimantic. The trains that run on these tracks are operated by Providence & Worcester Railroad which is a subsidiary of Genesee & Wyoming.\n\nOver the years, these railroads have been known by several different names because they have been owned and operated by many different railroad companies.\n\nThe map above is an 1876 snapshot in time of downtown Norwich. The town was booming. Hugh Henry Osgood was Mayor, Ponemah Mills was one of the largest textile mills in the United States, the Yantic Woolen Mill was in full operation, and there were more than six active gun manufacturers.\n\nThe combination of access to both a rail system and a port helped to make Norwich be one of the most important transportation hubs in New England. Its system of railroads and steamships provided manufacturers, merchants and individual passengers easy access to central New England, New York and Boston markets.\n\nThe first major development in the transportation system came in 1840 when the Norwich & Worcester Railroad opened. This line provided direct, railroad access from central New England to the port city of Norwich. At Norwich, cargo and passengers could be transferred to and from a steam ship headed to either New York or Boston. By the time this map was drawn, the Norwich & Worcester Railroad had been extended down to New London. And, the newer company, the New London Northern Railroad had built a line along the western banks of the Thames River that connected Norwich to New London, central Vermont, and even Canada.\n\nThe map also shows the locations of the two railroad stations at that time, the Norwich & Worcester Depot (#2 on map) and the New London Northern Depot (#7 on the map). The New London Northern Depot was replaced by Union Depot (#6 on the map) in 1891.\n\nThe Providence & Worcester Railroad that runs through Norwich today has been owned and operated by several different companies over the years. In 1840, the Providence & Worcester Railroad (then owned and operated by the Norwich & Worcester Railroad) was the first railroad to connect Norwich to Central New England. The original construction only included a single line from Norwich to Worcester.\n\nThe original railroad also included a 300-foot long tunnel near Taftville. The Taft Tunnel was the first common carrier tunnel to be built in the United States. It is still in operation today in its original form.\n\nThe Norwich & Worcester Depot, (located near downtown Norwich) stood at the beginning of the original Norwich & Worcester Railroad. It served as a passenger terminal.\n\nThe composition and types of locomotives powering the trains on the P&W has changed dramatically over the years. The placemarks below contain a brief summary of the history of development of the Norwich Depot, the trains, rails, and companies of the Providence & Worcester Railroad.\n\nCharles Rockwell was the Mayor and he knew that Norwich needed a railroad to support its burgeoning manufacturing interests. Before moving to Norwich, Charles and his brother John had played a role in various enterprises associated with the development of railroads in other parts of the United States. They were experienced railroad developers.\n\nIn 1832 a group of engineers and surveyors laid out the proposed Norwich & Worcester Railroad. The detailed path, shown on the left, winds its way from New London, Ct. through Norwich Ct., Jewett City Ct. and Webster, MA to Worcester, MA\n\nConstruction of the Norwich & Worcester Railroad on the first section of rail that spanned between Norwich and Worcester began on November 18, 1835.\n\nIn 1837 Charles Rockwell was the President the Norwich & Worcester Railroad and was the Mayor of Norwich. With his experience in railroad development and knowledge of civic affairs, he had the ability to greatly further the development of the Norwich transportation system. The opening of the first section of tracks, 59 miles long, in 1840 was a major milestone for Norwich.\n\nPassengers and freight could now easily travel between central New England and New York or Boston. Once rail passengers arrived in Norwich from central New England they could board one of the two steamboats (also owned by the Norwich & Worcester Railroad) headed to either New York or Boston.\n\nSometimes, in the middle of winter, the mouth of the Thames in Norwich can freeze over. In times like this the steam boats could not make it all the way to Norwich from New London. To remedy this problem, a second section of rail was laid between Norwich and Allyn Point. The green line on the map shows the location of the second section. This line was opened in 1843. This second section is 6 miles long.\n\nForty-six years later in 1889, the third section was built by the New York, New Haven and New England Railroad. This section, 6 miles long, connected Allyn Point to Groton. It is shown as a blue line on the map. Passengers could now complete a journey from Central New England to Groton without boarding a boat.\n\nThe Taft Tunnel, is 300-foot long and it cuts through Bundy Hill. its creation involved skillful engineering, an abundant amount of blasting powder, and many strong backs. The location of the tunnel is shown on the map above. Construction was completed and it was ready for rail to be laid on August 27, 1837. Some passenger and freight service began in September 1839, however, the Norwich & Worcester Railroad did not officially open until March 9, 1840.\n\nAt its opening, the Taft Tunnel had the honor of being the first common carrier railroad tunnel in the United States.\n\nWithin a decade, the line began to build its own locomotives and cars in a large shop in Norwich. The Norwich & Worcester Railroad also owned a succession of fine passenger steamers like the City of Worcester and City of Lowell. These boats carried passengers to/from New York and Boston from Norwich.\n\nIn 1898, when the New York, New Haven and New England Railroad purchased the Norwich & Worcester Railroad Company, it took control of a substantial operation. Today the line is part of the Providence & Worcester Railroad’s regional freight system owned by Genesee & Wyoming.\n\nThe book, “The Quickest Route – The History of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad,” by Elmer Farnham provides a much more detailed history of the Norwich & Worcester Railroad.\n\nThe photo on the left shows the first Norwich train station. It opened its doors in 1859 and was used as the passenger terminal for the Norwich & Worcester Railroad. At that point-in-time it was called the “Norwich & Worcester Depot”. The middle and right postcards illustrate Norwich’s second train station. It was built approximately 250-feet from the original, first station.\n\nThe middle postcard shows how from the station appeared from the train side, looking northwest. And, similarly, the right postcard illustrates the view from the street side, looking northeast. The middle and right postcards are circa 1910.\n\nWith four daily passenger and freight connections each way to Worcester, Norwich became a major transportation center with steamboat shipping to New York City through Long Island Sound. The route was the preferred Boston to New York route was via the Norwich and Worcester Railroad through Norwich.\n\nUntil the Thames River was bridged in 1889, Chelsea Harbor had full warehouse and passenger terminals with its favorable access to central New England.\n\nAfter the Norwich & Worcester Railroad was acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (commonly known as The New Haven) in 1898, the building became known as the “New York, New Haven and Hartford Station” and the “New York, New Haven and Hartford Depot”.\n\nThe New York and New England Railroad was a major railroad connecting the southern portion of New York state, Hartford CT, Providence RI and Boston, MA. It operated under the name of New York and New England Railroad from 1873-1893. It was envisioned as a direct route between New York City and Boston, and to be built to bypass the shoreline route of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H).\n\nThe portion of the railroad, just north of Norwich, which connects Willimantic to Plainfield is shown in the map above.\n\nPrior to 1950 the NYNH&H trains were powered by steam locomotives. The 1940’s photo above shows the last steam locomotive leaving on the NYNH&H line in Norwich.\n\nHistory\n\nThe NYNH&H Railroad operated in Norwich from 1891-1968. It dominated the region’s rail traffic for the first half of the 20th century. It went bankrupt in 1935. After it was reorganized and reduced in scope, NYNH&H Railroad subsequently went bankrupt again in 1961.\n\nOn January 1, 1969 the NYNH&H merged with the Penn Central Railroad. Unfortunately, a year later in 1970, Penn Central declared bankruptcy. At that point-in-time it was the largest bankruptcy in the U.S. history. Later, in 1976, the rail lines in Norwich (remnants of the original Norwich & Worcester Railroad) were purchased by the Providence & Worcester Railroad. Please refer to the placemark below for details.\n\nThe remnants of the defunct New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad system now forms the basis for Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line, and parts of Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, Shore Line East, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and freight operators such as CSX and the Providence & Worcester Railroad. The majority of the original NYNH&H system is now owned publicly by the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.\n\nToday’s Providence and Worcester Railroad is a Class II railroad owned by Genesee & Wyoming. The entire rail line system spans approximately 512 miles.\n\nThe trains still run through Norwich and pass by the old Train Station, now occupied by The Bulletin.\n\nThe locations of today’s Providence & Worcester (PW) lines are shown as thick, gold colored lines in the map below. The main lines run from: a)New London to Gardner, MA, and, b) Worcester to Providence, and c) North Haven to Hartford.\n\nThe Providence & Worcester Railroad now transports a variety of freight. The top commodities moved are: autos, auto parts, chemicals, plastics, minerals, and stones.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the NYNH&H went bankrupt in 1969, the P&W was bought by the Penn Central Railroad. However, Penn Central went bankrupt in the next year 1970. Providence & Worcester Railroad re-emerged three years later, on February 3, 1973, when they embarked on their inaugural run as an independent operating entity.\n\nSince then, the railroad has acquired many other lines from the former Penn Central, the Boston and Maine Railroad Company, and Consolidated Rail Corporation. On January 3, 2017 the Providence & Worcester Railroad joined the family of Genesee & Wyoming."
