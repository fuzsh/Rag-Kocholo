Click on the links below to learn about the accessibility services offered on our fixed-route system, as well as exciting developments underway to further expand access to all of our customers.\n\nAccessibility on the MBTA\n\nThe MBTA’s Office for Transportation Access (OTA) oversees programs and services for persons with disabilities and senior citizens. The OTA manages the MBTA’s paratransit program, The RIDE; the Call-A-Lift Bus Program; the Senior and Access Pass Program. The office addresses customer concerns regarding station, venicle and program access for the MBTA’s fixed route services: Bus subway, commuter rail, light rail (Green Line) and commuter boat. In addition, OTA staff provides travel information for customers who require an accessible route to get to their destination. The MBTA’s Office for Transportation Access in downtown Boston.

THE RIDE is operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under the ADA, paratransit functions as a ‘safety net’ for people whose disabilities prevent them from using public transit. It is not intended to be a comprehensive system of transportation that meets all the needs of persons with disabilities, and it is distinct from medical or human services transportation. You will travel with other customers going in the same general direction.\n\nAccessible vehicles are used to serve persons with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs and scooters. THE RIDE operates 365 days a year generally from 5 AM – 1 AM in sixty (60) cities and towns. For RIDE trips with origin and destination within 3/4 mile of fixed-route service that operates outside of these hours, or in other municipalities within 3/4 miles of MBTA bus service, extended RIDE service is available.The RIDE now operates in 62 cities and towns. Fares as of July 1, 2016. The local one-way ADA fare for each registered passenger or guest when booking 1-7 days in advance is $3.15.\n\nOne-way fares for premium non-ADA trips for each registered passenger or guest is $5.25. This applies when the trip origin and/or destination is greater than 3/4 miles from MBTA bus or subway service and outside of the core areas, or for same-day trip requests or changes, except for trip time negotiation. Reservations will confirm the fare when you schedule a trip.\n\nA Personal Care Assistant (PCA) accompanying a registered user is not charged a fare. One other person may travel as a guest. Additional guests are allowed if space is available. Any guest is charged the applicable fare as noted above. PCAs and guests must travel to and from the same destination at the same time as the registered user. Allow twenty one days to process application upon receipt.\n\nCall 617-222-5123 or 800-533-6282; TTY 617-222-5415 for information on towns and to receive an application.\n\nTravel Instruction Services\n\nThe MBTA offers a variety of free travel instruction services to help seniors and people with disabilities travel independently on the bus, train, and Commuter Rail.
