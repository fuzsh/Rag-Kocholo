        "text": "Former Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis, who along with former Republican Gov. William Weld heads the North South Rail Link Working Group, will drive from Mattapan through Boston to Lowell on Friday in a 1949 Hudson, a vehicle that is as outdated as parts of the public transit system in Greater Boston.\n\nAt 11 a.m. Friday, Nov.16, 2018, Gov. Dukakis will arrive in the rusty 1949 Hudson at the MBTA station in Mattapan, MA (where the trolleys running everyday are as old as the Hudson). At 1 p.m., Dukakis will arrive in the Seaport District at District Hall at 75 Northern Ave, Boston, at 3 p.m., he will arrive at the MBTA station in Lowell, MA.\n\nJoining Gov. Dukakis will be former State Representative John Businger, Vice Chair of the North South Rail Link Working Group, to answer questions about the need for regional rail, the North South Rail Link, and the future of transportation and the economy in Greater Boston with – or without – a link between North and South Stations.\n\nFixing the MBTA after years of neglect, as the Baker Administration is undertaking, is necessary but not sufficient for the future needs of the economy of Greater Boston.\n\nThis 1949 Hudson is a rolling metaphor and is as challenged as the Commonwealth’s commuter-rail system, which for decades has been comprised of separate and disconnected transportation systems. North Station serves Boston’s northern suburbs, and South Station serves the City’s southern and western systems. And never the twain shall meet for passengers, except for a long walk, an Uber or cab ride, or two timeconsuming MBTA connections.\n\nObserve that this 1949 Hudson was the model that was made famous in the popular movie “Driving Miss Daisy”. Honk the horn and the lights dim. Accelerate in the rain and the windshield wipers stop. The Hudson’s windup clock loses five minutes every day. It's antiquated, like th current MBTA system. Citizen commuters suffer with larger systemic handicaps every day on an MBTA system that has not kept up with the times.\n\nBuilding the North South Rail Link is a big undertaking but a necessary part of a functioning regional rail system that residents of the area deserves. Today the MBTA is running two old systems. A single link between them, in the form of a North South Rail Link tunnel beneath the city of Boston, would serve commuters, increase housing options for people who travel to their jobs, serve the environment, and contribute to decongestion of our seriously overburdened highways and streets."
