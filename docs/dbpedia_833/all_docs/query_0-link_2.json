The result not only helped New England become an economic driver in the early 19th century, but acted as a blueprint for future engineering endeavors in the young United States of America.",

        "text": "While the Middlesex Canal officially ended on the Charlestown side of the Charles River, city planners incorporated the success of the waterway during the Mill Pond’s transformation into the Bulfinch Triangle. The canal carved into the city landscape along Canal Street allowed boats to deliver goods into the city center. The area also became “the city’s gas station,” as hay from northern farms fed the horses which transported people and goods through Boston’s winding streets. Eventually, the open intersection of Merrimack, Charlestown, and Canal Streets adopted the name Haymarket Square based on the canal’s inland purpose.\n\nThe canal was a definitive engineering achievement of its day. William Weston introduced new surveying instruments into the American engineering profession which were later studied by builders of the Erie Canal completed in 1825. Loammi Baldwin imported volcanic ash from St. Eustatius in the Dutch West Indies in order to create a watertight cement for the lock system, revolutionizing the commercial cement industry. Finally, a floating towpath system featuring an underwater drawbridge system allowed the canal to traverse ponds and other bodies of water along the route. As in England, another engineering achievement – the steam locomotive – ultimately resulted in the Middlesex Canal’s demise. A team of surveyors led by Loammi Baldwin’s son proposed a route for the Boston and Lowell railroad closely following the canal’s path, and the railway opened for business in 1835. Over the next two decades, rail cars carrying 300-ton loads rendered the 30-ton barges on the canal obsolete – a passenger train could make the trip in only 70 minutes. The last toll on the canal was collected in 1850 after nearly half a century of service."
