        "text": "Bedford is located just off Route 95 (Massachusetts state route 128), about 15 miles west of Boston. State routes 4, 62, and 225 go through town, as does U.S. Route 3. Access the detailed street map (PDF).\n\nThree multi-use trails / paths are actively used for transportation and recreation in Bedford.\n\nThe MBTA provides public transportation options including buses (routes Number 62, Number 62 / 76, and Number 351) from the Alewife stop on the Red Line in Cambridge that serves Bedford. The 62 bus makes numerous stops in Arlington and Lexington on its way to and from Bedford. The MBTA's commuter rail is available in nearby Concord Center and West Concord. For schedules, please call 617-222-3200. For information on senior citizen/special needs passes, please call 617-222-5976.\n\nBedford BLT - Bedford's Local Transit Bus is available to take residents to area grocery stores (including Market Basket in Billerica), malls, and just about anywhere in Bedford. Service operates Monday through Friday between 8:30 am to 3 pm. The call-in period for same-day rides is Monday through Friday from 7:30 am to 8:30 am. Please call 781-275-2255 for details.\n\nThe Bedford Council on Aging maintains aninformative webpage with a host of information on transportation options geared toward seniors: View the Minuteman Senior Services Transportation Guide (PDF).\n\nThe Middlesex 3 Coalition operates a van shuttle weekdays from Alewife Station on the MBTA Red Line to the Crosby Drive area of Bedford and then on up Route 3 to various businesses along that corridor. Shuttle service is open to employees working in this area and is fee-based or free depending on the business.\n\nThe 128 Business Council operates the REV shuttle weekdays from Alewife Station on the MBTA Red Line to the Hartwell Avenues area in Bedford. Shuttle service is open to employees working in this area and is fee-based or free depending on the business.\n\nThe Lowell Regional Transit Authority (LRTA) provides fixed route bus services and paratransit services to Lowell and 14 surrounding communities, including several that border or are nearby Bedford.\n\nPark and Pedal - Designated parking spots in Bedford and other locations allow commuters to park a car in a designated spot and pedal a bike to their destination, avoiding \"last-mile\" congestion, curbing air pollution, and supporting physical activity.\n\nPark and Pedal is encouraging people to leave their cars - and frustration - behind, and bike the last few miles to work or other destinations. Park and Pedal is a free network of parking lot hubs conveniently located within a typical cycling distance of one to three miles from a community's employment centers.\n\nBedford has identified Depot Park, Concord Road at the Rail Trail, and the boat launch off Route 225 as locations for initial Park and Pedal designated parking spaces. Although there is no sign YET, Park and Pedal-ers can also use the Middlesex Community College Overflow lot on Springs Road adjacent to the VA Hospital.\n\nThese spots will allow commuters to park a car in a designated spot and pedal a bike to their destination, avoiding \"last-mile\" congestion and supporting efforts to address the growing problems related to driving along with traffic congestion like air quality and lack of opportunity for physical activity.\n\nOn the southern part of town, straddling Lexington and Lincoln lies Hanscom Field, where Massachusetts Port Authority operates an active civil air terminal for small private and industrial craft, proximate to Hanscom Air Force Base, an Air Force research base with a limited military craft activity.\n\nThe nearest international airport is Logan Airport in Boston. The closest Logan Express location to Bedford is in Woburn."
