        "text": "Updated August 21, 2024:\n\nShattuck St Cobblestone Restoration:\n\nStarting Monday, August 26, 2024, Shattuck St will be closed to vehicular traffic from Market St to Merrimack St to allow for cobblestone restoration as part of a gas main restoration program. Middle St will be open to two-way traffic from Palmer St to Shattuck St for the duration of the closure. Access to City Ave will be blocked at Shattuck.\n\nConcord River Greenway:\n\nWork to complete the connection between Jolene Dubner Park to the Lawrence Street portion of the greenway wrapped up in Spring 2022. The final phase of the Concord River Greenway, a stretch that spans from the terminus at the Davidson Street Lots to Jolene Dubner Park, will be completed when the City is able to negotiate access and construction rights along this stretch with multiple private property owners.\n\nConnector Trail:\n\nThis project will create a multi-use path that connects the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail in the Cross Point towers area with the Target shopping plaza along Plain Street. While portions of the project have been completed in the past year (paving and connection on the Industrial Avenue side of the trail, removal of vegetation and train tracks, and preparation for paving, including the initial gravel), the remaining portion of this project is still part of the Department of Planning and Development's goals. DPD has already contracted an engineering firm to update the drawings and construction scope (based on what has been completed so far) for a new bid to come out during the winter/spring of 2024. Concurrently, the legal department is working on the updated access agreement with the Target shopping plaza. DPD expects to resume construction during the summer of 2024 to finally connect the two ends of this much anticipated project, and to keep the efforts of expanding and improving the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail.\n\nLowell High School Construction Project:\n\nPlease visit our dedicated site for more information about this project, including regular video updates: lowellhsproject.com\n\nRoadway Projects:\n\nView current and completed roadway projects with the City of Lowell's Engineering Department: https://lowellma.gov/1765/Roadway-Projects\n\nState Transportation Projects\n\nBeaver Street Bridge Project:\n\nThe Beaver St. Bridge construction is substantially complete. The bridge is fully open to vehicular and pedestrian traffic as of July 25, 2024. A ribbon cutting is planned for September 2024, details to come.\n\nRourke Bridge Replacement Project:\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) is designing a new Rourke Bridge to replace the temporary structure across the Merrimack River in Lowell. The existing bridge was constructed in 1983 as a temporary bridge. The new bridge will connect Middlesex Street to Pawtucket Boulevard, improve mobility for all users, and meet current standards, including ADA accessibility.\n\nPlease visit the MassDOT Project site for more information: https://www.mass.gov/rourke-bridge-replacement-project\n\nRecently Completed Projects\n\nAndover Street (Route 133) and River Road Intersection Improvements\n\nThe project consisted of improvements to intersection safety, access and capacity, pedestrian facilities, bicycle accommodations and roadway rehabilitation. The project is substantially complete. Landscaping and hydroseeding was completed in spring 2024.\n\nPlease visit the MassDOT site for more information: https://hwy.massdot.state.ma.us/projectinfo.asp?num=609038\n\n330 Jackson Street Garage Construction:\n\nThis project is substantially complete, and new sidewalks were poured.\n\n2023 Roadways\n\nLord Overpass/Thorndike Street\n\nThis transformative infrastructure project removed aging overpass bridges, connected Jackson Street to Thorndike Street, improved the intersection at Dutton/Thorndike/Fletcher/Jackson Streets, and updated traffic signals to more effectively move travel into and out of the HCID and Downtown Lowell\n\nPlease visit the Lord Overpass page for more information: https://www.lowellma.gov/771/Lord-OverpassGateway-to-Lowell\n\nLowell Canal Bridges (TIGER) Project:\n\nThis project rehabilitated and replaced a network of critically important bridges over several canals in Lowell in order to eliminate weight restrictions that interfere with transportation circulation and access in the downtown area. Full beam replacement will provide an extended bridge life of approximately 40 to 50 years.\n\nHCID Parking Garage:\n\nThis project was completed on December 16, 2020. A 900-space parking garage was constructed to support public and private development in the Hamilton Canal Innovation District. The completion of the $38 million city-funded facility marks a significant and long anticipated milestone in the development of the Hamilton Canal District and represents the district's first completed ground-up construction project. The garage is considered to be a critical component in supporting future development throughout the 15-acre district.\n\nHamilton Canal Innovation District (HCID) North Infrastructure Project (\"Streets F and G\"):\n\nThis project will build two new streets and install utility infrastructure in the northern section of the HCID. The project includes major pedestrian and traffic improvements to the bridge at Dutton and Broadway, and construction of a new Signature Bridge over the Pawtucket Canal that will connect the north and south sides of the HCID. Newport Construction remobilized to the site this spring to complete minor punchlist items. All work, including minor lighting and railing changes to the signature bridge will be completed in the coming weeks. As of now, we are working with Atlantic Bridge & Engineering, (the contractor installing the railings and lighting) to set up a final installation date. Since Winn Development is done with their work, the bridge is now open to circulation pending additional safety and guiding signage around the area. VHB provided signage recommendations, which are currently being reviewed by the City before deciding on the bridge opening. That decision will be made in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMerrimack Riverwalk Phase II:\n\nThis project will extend the Merrimack Riverwalk under the Bridge Street Bridge, behind Massachusetts Mills, and over the Concord River to a new terminus in front of Lowell Memorial Auditorium via a new pedestrian bridge. The pedestrian bridge over the Concord River was installed in early October. The work area in front of LMA has been significantly reduced as work is now focused mostly on the interceptor along the river. A majority of the remaining work for the Riverwalk Project is limited to the interceptor area and should not cause traffic or pedestrian disruptions. Work on the interceptor will continue until a winter shutdown is necessary. Next spring contractors will finish off remaining work including landscaping, tree plantings and monument reinstallation in front of LMA. At this time we are anticipating a summer 2022 opening for the Riverwalk.\n\nJFK Plaza Improvements:\n\nA minor project to improve safety and remove deferred maintenance will commence this spring. DPD, in coordination with DPW, is working on the upgrades and improvements to the John F Kennedy Civic Center, including the transformation of selected sets of stairs into planting areas. DPD coordinated with LPD and Cultural Affairs & Special Events on the specific areas to remain open and closed for increased safety, security, and usability.\n\nThis project, consisting of stairs and landscape improvements at the JFK Civic Center Plaza in front of City Hall, is currently in final engineering phases and will proceed to bidding later in the month in December to secure a builder to begin work in the spring of 2022. The engineering phase includes structural details, construction methods and costs estimates.\n\nPrior Communications"
