        "text": "The architect and designer counts Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Ermenegildo Zegna and London’s forthcoming Peninsula Hotel among his clients. He also designs private residences\n\nPerfect weekends begin with a solo ride out to my home in Southampton, Long Island, on one of my bikes – a KTM 1290 Super Duke R or my Triumph Speed Triple. It all depends on how sporty I am feeling.\n\nSaturday morning opens with three cups of strong black coffee, before 9am, followed by a trip to Marders nursery to meet with garden designer Charlie Marder. He’s been running this institution since the 1970s and knows so much. They have all sorts of flowering fruit trees and a greenhouse shop too. Then I’ll typically spend two hours in my garden. We have a different flower for each month: forsythia, hydrangea, rhododendron, apple blossom. I’ll also tend to my five beehives – if you have more than 10 acres in Southampton you’re encouraged to keep bees because so many have been affected by mites.\n\nExercise is an important part of my weekend routine and Kip, my trainer, comes to work out with me for an hour before lunch. I was a gymnast in high school so I like the rings and parallel bars. Lunch is almost always a tuna melt from Sip ’n Soda, a classic 1950s diner, I might have two if I’ve worked out a lot.\n\nAfternoons often involve picking vegetables from our garden for the meal Giangi, our property manager, will grill for dinner. I try to eat clean and we grow our own tomatoes, cucumbers, kale and celery. We’ll buy meat or locally caught tuna from gourmet market Citarella and swordfish from seafood specialist Clamman.\n\nEvery weekend includes tennis – at my home or the Bath & Tennis Club, where I like the low-key atmosphere. It’s just six clay courts and perfect for round robins. I always make our house guests play; it’s like Mao’s Long March. But it’s usually followed by a refreshing swim and massages by Kip for whoever wants one.\n\nI don’t like to shop very much, but two exceptions are Tennis East – to get my rackets restrung and buy my tennis whites – and Book Hampton, a truly old‑fashioned bookstore. Late in the day, after the crowds have gone, I might go to Halsey Neck Lane Beach, primarily for my European guests who come to the Hamptons and want to see the ocean.\n\nOn Saturday night my wife Jane and I will host dinner for friends, as well as our nieces and nephews who come out from the city. It might be grilled lamb chops and lasagne prepared by Heidi, our chef, paired with wines chosen by my daughter, Isabelle. She is a sommelier and will select a bordeaux – from our wine cellar or from Domaine Franey, a first-class wine shop in East Hampton that specialises in French reds. Afterwards, we like to watch movies in our screening room – preferably happy ones that are an antidote to the rest of the crazy week. I’m a bit of a night owl, so I’m in bed anywhere between 12am and 2am.\n\nSundays start with the New York Post – I like the difficult 12-box sudoku and time myself. Then we might ride to Montauk with friends. We’ll stop at Gosman’s Dock, the famous fish place on the water with views of the boats in the harbour – I love the tuna tartare cones – before returning to Southampton for more tennis, swimming and apple-picking.\n\nWeekends are for relaxing, so I don’t look at email or social media. The air on Long Island is so oxygenated I sleep well and get re-energised for the coming week. I’ll head back to the city on my bike about 3pm. My wife and daughter go by car and we’ll meet for dinner at Mr Chow; we have a special table as it’s been a family favourite for 25 years – we’ll share their speciality, Beijing duck. Or we’ll go to Sette Mezzo, a simple Upper East Side Italian with a lively atmosphere. I travel from 12 to 15 days a month, so Sunday nights are family time.\n\nThe New York-based architect and soon-to-be Yale University School of Architecture dean discusses Japanese aesthetics, good books, and her interior designs for the new 432 Park Avenue.\n\nYou championed “the architecture of the everyday.” What does this mean to you?\n\nI championed this 20 years ago when I was commuting regularly up 1-95 to teach at Yale. This philosophy celebrated the beauty and inspiration in everyday life: from the diners we’d pass on the road, to new materials being used for construction. I still believe in unselfconscious design that we can all learn from, but I’m now most interested in designing buildings that are linked to where they are. So much of what gets built today could be anywhere. I’m arguing for architecture that’s specific to place.\n\nYou studied at London’s Architectural Association with Rem Koolhaas, Zaha Hadid, and Elia Zenghelis. What impact did this have on your work?\n\nThey are all completely fascinating people, but I would have to say that I was the AA that impacted my practice and opened my eyes to a different kind of architecture. There isn’t the same studio culture in the U.K. as in the U.S.—it’s much more about meeting with your critic over there.\n\nHow does living in New York inform your preferences for spare spaces and natural materials?\n\nI love New York but because it’s frenetic, dirty, and busy, people want simplicity, clarity, and serenity in their environments. They seek an antidote to the city. In addition to designing minimalist spaces, I tend to gravitate toward natural, clean materials in neutral hues that have integrity to them.\n\nYou have said that you have a longitude interest in cities as places where things get made. What cities are particularly interesting and productive today?\n\nRight now we are seeing an explosion in cities where things have traditionally been made or exchanged, and Detroit and Nashville are two prime examples of this. Boutique industries are thriving again—for the creation of musical instruments in Nashville, to the production of everything from belts to chairs to custom bicycles in secondary or tertiary cities. Small-scale production is really thriving again.\n\nHas being a woman in a field dominated by men felt like an impediment? Is the playing field being leveled with time?\n\nFor all women architects I know, there is a glass ceiling of a kind. One example: I was recently sitting in business class on an airplane and was asked what I do by the man seated next to me. When I said I was an architect, he immediately asked, “Do you do interiors?” There are lesser expectations for women. In general, there is a lack of diversity in architecture, and women are certainly better represented than many other groups. Architecture is hideously underrepresented of society as a whole.\n\nYour love of boutique hotels has led to an ongoing collaboration with 21c Hotels, a small chain of properties housed in restored historic buildings, in smaller cities. What’s important about these properties?\n\nI came to 21c through an interesting set of circumstances: I had pitched for a project in Louisville that we didn’t get, but one of the principals liked what he heard and asked us to help revitalize that downtown That has led to work on a series of important buildings, from a conversion project in Buffalo that involves an H.H. Richardson building, to an addition to I.M. Pei’s Rockefeller Arts Center at SUNY Fredonia, to a hotel project in a Shreve Lambs & Harmon building in Durham, and an Albert Kahn building in Oklahoma City that were transforming from a Ford plant into a hotel. These are all great buildings that are of a place. We hope to transform them, yet keep them deeply grounded in their sites.\n\nHow did being a model influence your design aesthetic? Do you have an appreciation for fashion?\n\nMy mother was a lingerie designer and I’ve always had a love of fashion. She was a professor at FIT. Her creative life was an inspiration to me, as was her passion for teaching.\n\nAre you still tied to that world? Narciso Rodriquez is a friend.\n\nNarciso and I had drinks last night, and he gave me a beautiful book on Brazilian modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi. He loves architecture, so we always have that to discuss, as well as art exhibits at the MoMA, Supreme Court decisions, government policies, and politics in general.\n\nYour firm hosts a rotating art program at the studio that showcases work by up-and-coming artists. How is this series curated?\n\nA three-person curatorial committee selects work by older artists, young people, and artwork that runs the gamut from prints for paintings to sculpture and group shows. The common thread is that the art just has to interest us in some way. These exhibitions are good for office morale—very fun for parties, as they add to the studio environment. And they’re a great forum for emerging artists who don’t always have gallery representation.\n\nNew York’s Marianna Boesky Gallery, which you designed, is a combination of corrugated metal and concrete, juxtaposed against the High Line. How did the location influence your choice of materials?\n\nThe 6,000-square-foot building refers to the industrial, garage like composition of the West Chelsea neighborhood. It is composed of custom concrete blocks and also incorporates glazed white brick and corrugated metal. It was the first building built under the new High Line zoning, and it’s contextual to the surroundings. The interiors of the gallery are austere and muted, all to highlight the art within.\n\nIf you were to invite the greats of architecture and design to dinner, whom might you include?\n\nBy definition they’d all have to be dead—otherwise I’d just have a dinner party! I’d much rather invite poets, composers, and dancers, as I love talking to people who do things other than what I do. Gertrude Stein and Maria Tallchief would be right at the top of my guest list…\n\nHow has your design process evolved from early loft conversions in the 1980s to the collaboration with Rafael Viñoly on 431 Park, currently the tallest building in the western hemisphere?\n\nWe are living in cities in very different ways now and the definition of luxury has changed dramatically. Luxury is omnipresent. Much of the work that I do is “whole vision.” We design the building to the furnishings. This project was very different in that way.\n\nCan you elaborate on the exquisite finishes, fabrics, lighting solutions and custom hardware at 432 Park?\n\nHarry Macklowe, the developer, is an old-school modernist and came up to us because he wanted an elegant, understate, spare aesthetic that capitalized on the stunning views in all directions. We took inspiration from the classic apartments of Park Avenue for floor plans and layouts. We looked at the way spaces were traditionally used in terms of general lifestyle and the flow for entertaining in particular. Everything form the herringbone floors, to the baseboards, to the bathrooms with windows that can be seen throughout the half-floor model apartment references the work of historic Park Avenue buildings by the likes of Rosario Candela.\n\nWhich artists—and what kind of artwork—would you like to see in these spaces at 432 Park?\n\nThe walls here are vast and are designed to take art. In the model apartment there are “Seascape” photographs by Hiroshi Sugimoto, prints by Ellsworth Kelly and Donald Sultan, and the table by Yves Klein. Old Master paintings would work just as well as the light and spaces are so beautiful.\n\nWhich building or buildings do you think are the greatest of all time?\n\nIt’s hard to narrow it down, but I’m a huge fan of both Eliel and Eero Saarinen, and the First Christian Church in Columbus, Indiana, is among my favorites. The space, light, and materiality all make this sacred building feel not too precious. Louis Kahn’s library at the Phillips Exeter Academy is another great one. The materiality of it has influenced me forever.\n\nWhat is one place that you’ve traveled to in the past year that really impressed you from a design perspective?\n\nThe attention to detail in Japan is incredible. It seems that everything is highly considered, from both a visual and functional perspective. This is true to the architecture, yes, but of every other craft, too. Fabric design, cooking, urban design—they all have a connection to quality and tradition, which is felt even if the idea or expression is new. Naoshima, an art-filled island, is a great example of this.\n\nYou famously eschew clutter. What’s an area of your life where you make an exception?\n\nBooks. I can’t get rid of them and they line the shelves in both my New York City apartment and at my home in Long Island. From art and architecture tomes, to fiction, to biographies to books about philosophy, I’m an avid collector.\n\nWhat are the books on your bedside table?\n\nMany at any given time. I’m currently reading the Alexander Hamilton biography by Ron Chernow; Between You & Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen by New Yorker proofreader Mary Norris; and James Salter’s A Sport and a Pastime. Next up will be 1939, a book about the failure of diplomacy to stop World War II. I always have a stack of magazines, too—everything from Vogue and Allure to The Economist and The Nation.\n\nThe architect and industrial designer explores the city’s paintings, porticos and botanical gardens and Brera backstreets\n\n“Saturday mornings start at my local newsstand, Reno Giornalaio, at the end of Via Brera. I love the ritual of walking and getting the papers – everything from Corriere della Sera to the FT and The New York Times for my wife [American architect and interior designer, Terry Dwan] – and then settling into one of the local bars, Caffè Fernanda, inside the Pinacoteca di Brera, for coffee and brioche. The sense of community in these places is wonderful, but I also like that there’s no pressure to talk to anyone.\n\nAfter a long while spent reading, I might go to any number of galleries and museums. I’m an art collector, and I find inspiration at places such as Gallery Massimo di Carlo; it’s a fantastically inspiring space by Piero Portaluppi who also designed the famous Villa Necchi. I’m drawn to the Palazzo Reale, especially during Salone del Mobile, and the Brera Museum, which has one of the best collections of Italian Renaissance paintings and an exemplary Lombard baroque courtyard – its portico has an unrivalled collection of full-size casts of monumental classical sculptures, and real 19th-century marble sculptures.\n\nI’m a member of the advisory committee of the Museo del Design Italiano on the ground floor of the Triennale. The centre has constantly changing architecture exhibitions – our practice has designed installations here – and is a source not only of inspiration but also debate. There’s also a nice design café, where I’ll sit outside and have seabass carpaccio and salad for lunch.\n\nThe Triennale has constantly changing architecture exhibitions and a design café | Image: Stefan Giffthaler\n\nPeople come to Milan for the creative energy, the food and the fashion – and there is no better time to watch this all unfold than at the weekends. I’m not a trendy guy, but I am also not above taking a touristy stroll past La Scala, through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and on to the Duomo, before heading to quieter stretches such as Via Mozza and Via della Passione, which have a truly Milanese spirit.\n\nQuadrilatero – or the Golden Triangle – is lovely, too, for window shopping. The thing that most sparks my curiosity is the constant change of storefronts and tenants, a never-ending cycle of activity bringing new brands and installations. I walk through this area at the end of every work day, so sometimes at the weekend I prefer to explore the calmer neighbourhood streets. There is so much to explore near my house in Brera, including one of the city’s most beautiful churches, the neo-gothic Santa Maria del Carmine, with its terracotta façade. And the nearby Botanical Garden is one of my favourite escapes. After a period of neglect, this place, which was created at the behest of Maria Theresa of Austria, has now been restored. Today, passing through an area of monumental buildings, you suddenly enter a peaceful oasis full of nature and history.\n\nThe highlight of any day is aperitivo and I always go to the bar at the Bulgari Hotel Milano. They make me a special margarita il solito just the way I like it, with reposado [aged in oak barrels] tequila, and Niko Romito’s finger food is excellent. I might meet a friend here to discuss art and design and I feel it’s an important, enjoyable conclusion to the day, but one drink is always enough.\n\nI’ll meet Terry for dinner at Torre di Pisa, a classic place that was once a favourite with Ettore Sottsass and the Memphis group, as well as fashion designers and journalists. It still feels very ’60s and the simple dishes of spaghetti alla puttanesca and ribollita go well with a glass of Tuscan red. They make a special insalata mista for Terry: I like it when a restaurant feels like your own private kitchen.\n\nSunday mornings start with a walk in Sempione Park and on to the Castello Sforza – I enjoy the wide-open spaces. For lunch, we might go to L’Arabesque, a design store with a café that serves excellent risottos and grilled fish, or to the Mudec Museum, a contemporary art collection that does a nice Sunday brunch. On the rare Sunday night that we don’t eat at home, we’ll go to Langosteria, which has the best seafood tartares, or maybe to Nobu, near our house. I like the cleanliness and fresh taste of Japanese food, and it can be a nice change at the end of a weekend with a typically Milanese flavour.”"
