        "text": "Introduction\n\nFast Facts\n\n25th president of the United States\n\nServed 1897–1901\n\nRepublican Party\n\nElected in 1896 and 1900\n\nState of birth: Ohio\n\nVice presidents: Garret A. Hobart and Theodore Roosevelt\n\nFirst lady: Ida McKinley\n\n(1843–1901). On the night of February 15, 1898, a mysterious explosion sank the U.S. battleship Maine in the harbor of Havana, Cuba. More than 260 Americans died. The cause of the explosion was unclear, but many Americans blamed Spain, the colonial ruler of Cuba. They demanded action. The U.S. president, William McKinley, wanted to keep the peace, but ultimately he led the country into war. The Spanish-American War opened a new chapter in U.S. history. By winning overseas territories from Spain, the United States suddenly became a world power.\n\nWilliam McKinley had been elected the 25th president of the United States in 1896. Earlier he had served in the U.S. Congress and as governor of Ohio. When McKinley came to the White House, the U.S. economy was beginning a strong recovery from a devastating economic depression. The new prosperity, along with the successful war, helped McKinley win reelection in 1900. His second term would be cut short, however. In September 1901, just six months after his inauguration, McKinley died at the hands of an assassin.\n\nMcKinley was greatly admired by the American people. It was not because of his deeds as president or even because of his tragic death but simply because of his personality. He was an honorable, compassionate man who respected and cared about people. Many historians, too, have come to regard McKinley favorably. They see him as a firm and skillful leader at a key moment in the country’s history.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMcKinley was known for wearing a red carnation on his lapel as a good-luck charm. In his honor, his home state of Ohio named the red carnation its state flower in 1904.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMcKinley was born and raised in small towns in Ohio. He worked as a schoolteacher before joining the army during the American Civil War. Then, back in Ohio, he made a name for himself as a lawyer.\n\nFamily and Education\n\nWilliam McKinley’s father and mother were both of Scottish ancestry. The first McKinley to come to America, known as David the Weaver, settled in York county, Pennsylvania, in 1743. William’s father and grandfather were managers of blast furnaces for smelting iron in what is now Lisbon, Ohio. In 1829 William’s father, also named William, married Nancy Allison. They moved the following year to Niles, Ohio.\n\nThe future president was born in Niles on January 29, 1843, the seventh of nine children. His mother was a strong, energetic woman, a leader in the frontier village and active in the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was said that she and her sister “ran the church, all but the preaching.” In 1852, when William was nine, the family moved to Poland, Ohio, to enroll the children in a private school. At the Poland Academy William showed a gift for public speaking. He organized and was elected president of a debate club at the school.\n\nAt age 17 William entered Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He stayed only a few months, returning home because of illness. Then, feeling that he could not afford to continue in college, he taught in a country school near Poland. He lived with his family and walked two and a half miles (about four kilometers) to the school. After school hours he worked as a clerk in the Poland post office.\n\nCivil War Service\n\nFind Out:\n\nWhich future U.S. president was McKinley’s commanding officer in the Civil War?\n\nWhat did McKinley do during the Battle of Antietam?\n\nThat spring, in April 1861, the American Civil War broke out. In June McKinley joined the Union Army. His commanding officer was Rutherford B. Hayes, who was later to become president of the United States.\n\nAt the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, McKinley was in charge of the food supplies of his unit. The battle had started at daybreak. As the morning wore on, McKinley loaded a wagon with food and coffee and drove two miles to the front. General Hayes wrote of the incident:\n\nFrom his hands every man in the regiment was served with hot coffee and warm meats, a thing that had never occurred under similar circumstances in any other army in the world. He passed under fire and delivered, with his own hands, these things, so essential for the men for whom he was laboring.\n\nFollowing the battle, the governor of Ohio promoted McKinley to the rank of second lieutenant. McKinley’s courage and good judgment were displayed on many other occasions, and when the war ended he had the rank of major.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMcKinley was the last U.S. president who was a Civil War veteran.\n\nYoung Lawyer\n\nAfter the war McKinley studied law for two years. He began a practice in Canton, Ohio, where his eldest sister, Anna, was a well-known teacher with many influential friends. McKinley became known for his honesty and for taking up unpopular causes. For example, the Ohio constitution gave the vote to white men only. McKinley believed that this was unjust, and he often spoke on the subject, facing unfriendly audiences without fear.\n\nAt one time miners engaged in a strike were arrested and charged with burning property. No other lawyer would defend them. McKinley acted as their lawyer and proved that most of them were innocent. Knowing they were penniless as a result of the long strike, he refused to accept payment for his services.\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nIn 1871 McKinley married Ida Saxton, the daughter of a Canton banker. The young couple had a daughter, Katie, in 1871 and another, Ida, in 1873. The future seemed bright—but soon tragedy struck. Both Ida McKinley’s mother and the couple’s infant daughter died within months of each other in 1873. Then, two years later, Katie died at age three.\n\nShattered by grief, Ida McKinley became ill and never recovered. She often experienced seizures that may have been caused by epilepsy, though doctors did not understand the illness at the time. William McKinley remained devoted to her. His unfailing attentiveness earned him great admiration from the public.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nWhile working as a lawyer, William McKinley was drawn to politics in the Republican Party. He represented Ohio in Congress for over a decade before becoming governor of his home state.\n\nFind Out:\n\nHow did an economic depression advance McKinley’s political career?\n\nWhat was McKinley’s “front porch” campaign?\n\nCongressman\n\nMcKinley won his first public office in 1869, when he was elected prosecuting attorney for Stark county. In 1876, at age 33, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served there for 14 years, rising steadily in the Republican Party.\n\nMany of the people McKinley represented in Ohio were manufacturers. McKinley believed that a high tariff, or tax on imported goods, would help American manufacturers by making imported goods more expensive. He wrote and strongly promoted a law that became known as the McKinley Tariff of 1890. The law was very unpopular with the people because it increased prices of goods. In the 1890 election angry voters removed McKinley and many other Republicans from office.\n\nGovernor of Ohio\n\nFrom 1892 to 1896 McKinley served two terms as governor of Ohio. One of his most important acts during his time in the governor’s office was to establish a state board to settle disputes between business owners and their workers.\n\nWhile he was governor, McKinley continued to take an active part in national affairs. The panic of 1893, a devastating economic depression, struck the country while the Democrats were changing the tariff policy. This gave Republican leaders an opportunity to blame the Democrats for causing the panic. In 1894 McKinley made hundreds of speeches throughout the country on behalf of Republican candidates for Congress. He had his eye on the Republican nomination for the presidency in 1896.\n\nPresidential Campaign\n\nMcKinley was supported in this ambition by Mark Hanna, a wealthy Ohio manufacturer and political leader. Hanna managed and secured funding for McKinley’s presidential campaign. Garret A. Hobart, a New Jersey senator, was McKinley’s vice presidential running mate. The Democratic nominee for president was William Jennings Bryan.\n\nThe campaign was fought on an issue other than the tariff. The main concern was the country’s money supply. The Republicans wanted to keep the gold standard—that is, a money system based only on gold. The Democrats believed in bimetallism—that is, a money system based on both gold and silver.\n\nBryan was the leader of the Free Silver Movement, which called for the unlimited use of silver for currency. He had the support of poor farmers and other people in debt, who thought they would benefit from a Free Silver policy. Western mining companies were also behind him. Backing McKinley were the bankers and manufacturers.\n\nThe campaign was unusual. Bryan toured the country, traveling many thousands of miles and delivering hundreds of speeches. McKinley ran a “front porch” campaign. He stayed at home in Canton, greeting more than 750,000 visitors who came to hear him speak. McKinley won the election by an electoral college vote of 271 to Bryan’s 176 votes.\n\nPresidency\n\nMcKinley’s presidency was a turning point in U.S. history. When he took office, many Americans were eager for the country to play a stronger role on the world stage. Under McKinley, the United States would become an empire.\n\nA New Tariff\n\nSoon after his inauguration McKinley called a special session of Congress to consider tariff revision. His tariff act of 1890 had been changed by the Democrats. Within a few months a bill known as the Dingley Tariff Act once again raised the tariff on many imported items. It was the highest tariff in U.S. history to that time.\n\nSpanish-American War\n\nFind Out:\n\nHow did a rumor help lead the United States into war with Spain?\n\nWhy did the U.S. secretary of state call the Spanish-American War “a splendid little war”?\n\nIn world affairs, McKinley faced a conflict on the island of Cuba, near the Florida coast. At the time Cuba was a colony controlled by Spain, and for years Cubans had been rebelling against Spain’s harsh rule. Many Americans wanted to see the United States take action against Spain. Early in 1898 the United States sent the battleship Maine to the harbor of Havana, Cuba, to protect Americans in case war should break out. In February 1898 the Maine exploded, with a loss of more than 260 lives.\n\nMcKinley had tried to keep the United States out of the conflict in Cuba. However, American anger toward Spain reached new heights after the destruction of the Maine. Decades later an investigation would prove that the ship was destroyed not by Spain but by an internal explosion. At the time, however, newspaper reports convinced Americans that Spain was responsible. Even the assistant secretary of the navy, Theodore Roosevelt, strongly urged war. McKinley was forced to recommend to Congress that the United States free Cuba by force. War was declared on April 25.\n\nAfter just three months of fighting, the Spanish-American War ended in victory for the United States. The Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898, freed Cuba from Spanish rule and gave Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. The conflict was so brief, and the gains for the United States so large, that Secretary of State John Hay called it “a splendid little war.”\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe United States brought Hawaii under its control in 1898, during the Spanish-American War. Two years later it would make the islands a U.S. territory.\n\nAmerican rule sparked rebellion in the Philippines. Just weeks after the end of the Spanish-American War, the Philippines declared itself an independent country. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected president. He led attacks on U.S. forces until his capture in 1901. Then the United States established a new government led by William Howard Taft, a future U.S. president.\n\nEvents in China\n\nWorld power brought the United States into closer contact with the great powers of Europe and Asia. Soon China became a major focus for McKinley’s government. A disastrous war with Japan had left China weakened. Japan and several European countries—Russia, France, Germany, and Great Britain—were scrambling to seize Chinese territory and establish exclusive trading rights with China. McKinley feared that the United States could be shut out of the huge Chinese market. To protect U.S. interests, he authorized Secretary of State Hay to issue a statement asking Japan and the European powers to keep China open to trade with all countries. This statement became known as the Open Door Policy. It was honored for more than 40 years.\n\nThe presence of foreigners in China stirred anger among the people. In 1900 Chinese peasants began killing Westerners—Europeans and Americans—in and around the city of Beijing. The peasants practiced boxing rituals and other exercises that they believed would protect them from harm. The Westerners called them Boxers and their uprising the Boxer Rebellion. McKinley sent U.S. troops to China as part of an international military force. The force defeated the Boxers and captured Beijing, freeing the foreigners trapped there. Hay, meanwhile, persuaded the other powers not to use the uprising as an excuse for further interference in China.\n\nReelection and Death\n\nThrough his first four years, President McKinley continued to grow in popularity. The successful war and the country’s prosperity weakened opposition to his administration. There was no doubt that McKinley would be renominated as the Republican presidential candidate in 1900. Vice President Hobart had died in office. Theodore Roosevelt, then governor of New York, was nominated for vice president. The Democrats renominated William Jennings Bryan, but the money issue that had made Bryan strong in 1896 was weak in 1900. McKinley won with 292 electoral votes to Bryan’s 155.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nA well-known Republican slogan during McKinley’s 1900 reelection campaign was “Four years more of the full dinner pail.” A dinner pail was a metal box that many workers of the time used to carry their lunch or dinner. The slogan touted the prosperity of McKinley’s first term and promised more of the same.\n\nFollowing his second inauguration, McKinley left Washington for a speaking tour of the western states. Throughout the journey he was met by cheering crowds. In September 1901 he spoke to a crowd of more than 50,000 people at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.\n\nOn September 6, the day after his address, McKinley held a public reception in the Temple of Music of the exposition. Hundreds of people lined up to shake his hand. An anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, approached among the guests, his right hand concealed in a bandage. It held a revolver. Czolgosz fired two shots, striking the president in the chest and abdomen. Rushed to a hospital in Buffalo, McKinley lingered for a week before dying in the early morning hours of September 14. His last words were “Good-bye—Good-bye, all. It is God’s way. His will, not ours, be done.” McKinley was buried in Canton, Ohio."
