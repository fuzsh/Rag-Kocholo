        "text": "Leon Czolgosz (born 1873, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—died October 29, 1901, Auburn, New York) was an American labourer and anarchist who fatally shot U.S. Pres. William McKinley on September 6, 1901; McKinley died eight days later. Czolgosz was found guilty and executed.\n\nWhile various sources, including police documents, list his birthplace as Detroit, others claim that Czolgosz was born in Alpena, Michigan. His parents were immigrants, and the family moved often. In 1893 Leon was living in Cleveland, where he worked at a wire mill. That year wages were cut, resulting in a strike. Czolgosz was fired and blacklisted, though he managed to get his job back the following year using a different name, Fred Nieman or Fred C. Nieman (the Polish/German surname translates as “nobody”). The experience left him disaffected, and he increasingly focused on inequality between the wealthy and workers. In 1898 he quit his job—some sources claim he had a nervous breakdown—and settled on the family’s farm. Over the next several years Czolgosz spent much of his time reading radical works, and he reportedly developed a fascination with anarchist Gaetano Bresci, who fatally shot Umberto I of Italy over the king’s repressive policies.\n\nIn 1901 Czolgosz became more involved in the anarchist movement, meeting Emma Goldman and members of the Liberty Club. However, he used his assumed name, and when this was discovered, the organization warned its members about a possible government spy. In the summer of 1901 Czolgosz moved to Buffalo, New York, which was hosting the Pan-American Exposition. On September 6 McKinley was at the expo’s Temple of Music for a meet and greet. Czolgosz attended, and when it was his turn in the receiving line, he shot McKinley twice. The president died on September 14, 1901."
