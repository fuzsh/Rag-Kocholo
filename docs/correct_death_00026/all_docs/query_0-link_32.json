Here for the Pan-American Exposition, William McKinley ultimately lost his life to an assassin’s bullet and Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office. The Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site tells the tale of this pivotal time in American history through high-tech, interactive exhibits. A marker on Fordham Avenue signals the spot where the deadly shot rang out, and the McKinley Monument stands at the center of downtown in memory of the fallen president.   Our 13th president, Millard Fillmore was one of two Buffalonians who served as president. Fillmore lived in East Aurora in a home he built for himself and his new bride. You can visit the Millard Fillmore House today. Fillmore’s final resting place is in Buffalo’s historic Forest Lawn Cemetery.   The other Buffalonian POTUS is Grover Cleveland. Cleveland built his political career in Buffalo, serving as both sheriff of Erie County and Mayor of Buffalo prior to serving as our nation’s 22nd and 24th president. A statue of him stands outside Buffalo’s City Hall.   You can also see portraits of each of the presidents and first ladies at the Karpeles Manuscript Museum at Elmwood and North Streets in the city’s Allentown neighborhood.
