        "meta_description": "Three sequences of the funeral ceremonies held for President William McKinley: Sequence 1: McKinley's body lay in state in the Rotunda of the Capitol, Washington, D.C. on Sept. 17, 1901; views of officers on horseback, the Artillery Band (wearing dark headdresses), a squadron of cavalry, a battalion of artillery and coast artillery, Marine Band (wearing white helmets), battalion of Marines, civilians carrying umbrellas (may be the diplomatic corps), other civilians, guard of honor, pallbearers, and the horsedrawn hearse all turning the corner off what may be Pennsylvania Avenue on their way to the Capitol; camera pans the hearse, as a procession of carriages turns the corner. Sequence 2: McKinley's body first lay in state for public viewing in Buffalo, N.Y. on Sept. 15-16; views of carriages, the horsedrawn hearse, and marchers stopping in front of the Buffalo City Hall; medium close shots of the casket being unloaded from hearse and carried up stairs of City Hall; crowds of mourners lining up to view the body as group of soldiers enters City Hall; camera pans crowd gathered outside as mourners enter and leave City Hall. Unrelated sequence of Washington ceremonies follows; camera pans from different angles of crowds gathered at the east front of the Capitol. Sequence 3: McKinley's body was conveyed to its final resting place at Canton, Ohio on Sept. 18-19; views of mounted military units, marching civilians, carriages, and the horsedrawn hearse turning and entering what is probably Westlawn Cemetery where McKinley is buried; military units marching down a street as gathered crowds watch; final pans of mourners, crowds, and soldiers outside the McKinley home in Canton.",
