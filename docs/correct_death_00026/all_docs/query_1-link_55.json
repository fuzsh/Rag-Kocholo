        "text": "At A Glance\n\nThe Inquirer initiated a public subscription to erect a memorial to McKinley following his assassination\n\nThe Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) coordinated the project\n\nMcKinley is shown delivering a speech with a symbolic figure of wisdom instructing a youth below him\n\nFollowing the assassination of President William McKinley on September 14, 1901, the Philadelphia Inquirer initiated a public subscription to erect a proper memorial. McKinley himself was associated with the city’s monuments having dedicated the Washington and Grant memorials.\n\nMcKinley, who was known for his tariff and currency policies, is depicted in a characteristic pose in the midst of delivering a speech.\n\nThe Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) was asked to coordinate the project and initiated a design competition. Of the thirty-eight models that were submitted for consideration, that of Charles Albert Lopez was chosen.\n\nBorn in Metamora, Mexico, Charles Lopez studied with John Quincy Adams in New York City, and later at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Lopez showed great promise when he was awarded the McKinley commission, but he died unexpectedly, soon after completing the working models for the sculpture. The executors of the fund and and the Committee on Design selected Isidore Konti, an artist born in Vienna and known for his decorative monumental work, to complete the memorial.\n\nMcKinley, who was known for his tariff and currency policies, is depicted in a characteristic pose in the midst of delivering a speech. Below him sits a symbolic figure representing wisdom instructing a youth.\n\nAdapted from Public Art in Philadelphia by Penny Balkin Bach (Temple University Press, Philadelphia, 1992) and Sculpture of a City: Philadelphia’s Treasures in Bronze and Stone by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) (Walker Publishing Co., New York, 1974).\n\nVoices heard in the Museum Without Walls: AUDIO program: Lewis L.
