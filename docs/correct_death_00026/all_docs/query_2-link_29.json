        "text": "The U.S. President has not always had people protecting him. In the country's early years, many people believed the young democratic republic was immune to political violence. The White House was even relatively open; only one policeman and a secretary stood between the president and Pennsylvania Avenue. With each presidential assassination, however, protection has increased from protecting not only the president, but also their family, former presidents, and presidential candidates.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nShot: April 14, 1865\n\nDied: April 15, 1865\n\nWhere: Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy Whom: John Wilkes Booth\n\nHow: Booth, a well-known actor, slips into Lincoln's private box as the president, his wife and friends take in a show at 10:15 pm at Ford's Theater. Booth shoots Lincoln once in the head and then jumps down to the stage, yelling \"Sic Semper Tyrranis\" (\"Thus ever to tyrants,\" the Virgina state motto) and escapes the theater.\n\nWhy: Five days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrenders in Virginia, ending the Civil War, Booth acts out a desperate plan to throw the Union into disarray to save the Confederacy.\n\nWhat happened to the president: Doctors realize quickly that Lincoln, paralyzed and struggling to breathe, will not survive his injuries. He is pronounced dead at 7:22 the following morning.\n\nWhat happened to the assailant: Despite breaking his leg jumping from Lincoln's private box to the stage, Booth escapes the theater and is met by a co-conspirator. The two make their way to Virginia, with federal troops following behind as Booth had been recognized by a number of theater-goers. After surrounding the barn where Booth is hiding in Virginia, troops set fire to it to flush Booth and his co-conspirator out. Booth refuses to leave and is shot in the neck by a federal troop who later says that Booth raised a gun. Booth is rescued from the burning house and lives for three hours before dying.\n\nJames Garfield\n\nShot: July 2, 1881\n\nDied: September 19, 1881\n\nWhere: Baltimore and Potomac Train Station in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy Whom: Charles Guiteau\n\nHow: Guiteau, a frustrated office-seeker, stalks Garfield for days before waiting for the president in the Baltimore and Potomac train station in Washington D.C. Guiteau shoots President Garfield twice, the first shot grazes the president's arm, and the second shot hits Garfield in the back. Guiteau is captured by police as he flees the train station. He always believed he would be caught, but thought that the vice president would pardon him.\n\nWhy: Guiteau felt betrayed by Garfield after Garfield did not appoint him to a diplomatic post.\n\nWhat happened to the president: Despite doctors' initial pronouncements that Garfield was as good as dead, the bullet did not kill the president. However, repeated unsanitary probing of his wound and a lack of understanding of antiseptic medicine led to an infection that ravaged the president's body. Garfield died on September 19, 1881, 79 days after being shot.\n\nWhat happened to the assailant: Charles Guiteau was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on July 21, 1882.\n\nWilliam McKinley\n\nShot: September 6, 1901\n\nDied: September 14, 1901\n\nWhere: The Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo, NY\n\nBy Whom: Leon Czolgosz\n\nHow: As President McKinley shakes hands at the Pan-American Exhibition in Buffalo, NY, Czolgosz approaches the president and shoots him twice in the chest. He continues advancing, planning to shoot a third time, and is wrestled to the ground by a bodyguard.\n\nWhy: Czolgosz was an anarchist who said he killed McKinley because he was the head of a corrupt government. His last words were, \"I killed the president because he was the enemy of the good peopleâ€”the working people.\"\n\nWhat happened to the president: Shot twice in the chest, McKinley seemed to be recovering from the assassination attempt until September 12, when his health deteriorated rapidly. He died of gangrene infection.\n\nWhat happened to the assailant: Unrepentant, Czolgosz is convicted and sentenced to death by electrocution. He is executed on October 29, 1901.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy"
