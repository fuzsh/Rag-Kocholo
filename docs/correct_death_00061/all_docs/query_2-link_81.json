        "text": "John Blackburne was an English businessman, landowner and renowned amateur botanist.\n\nHe was the second son of wealthy salt merchant Jonathan Blackburne of Orford Hall, Warrington, and his first wife Anne Lever. He inherited Orford on the death of his father in 1724.\n\nThere in coal-fired hothouses he established a large exotic plant collection, amongst which were some of the earliest English specimens of pineapple, coffee, tea and sugarcane. He was assisted in his endeavours by his daughter Anna, who was herself to become a noted botanist. A detailed catalogue of the whole collection was produced in 1779 by the head gardener, Adam Neal, which has provided the basis of several books. Anna’s natural history tutor, Dr Reinhold Forster (profiled later), who later sailed as naturalist on Cook’s second voyage, named a new genus of fan palm Sabal blackburniana in the family’s honour.\n\nBlackburne was selected High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1743–44 and in 1769 bought the lordship of the manor of Warrington.\n\nHe died in 1786 and was buried at St Oswald’s Church, Winwick. He had married Catherine Ashton and had 9 children. His eldest son Thomas, High Sheriff in 1763, predeceased him and thus his estate passed to Thomas’ son, John, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lancashire. His second son John became Mayor of Liverpool. A younger son Ashton emigrated to the United States and collected bird specimens, many of them new to science.\n\nInformation retrieved from Wikipedia.\n\nJohn Aikin Snr was an English Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy, a prominent dissenting academy.\n\nHe was born in 1713, in London. His father, a linen-draper, came originally from Kirkcudbright, in southern Scotland. He was placed for a short time as French clerk in a mercantile house, but entered Kibworth Academy, then run by Philip Doddridge, for whom Aikin was the first pupil. He then went to Aberdeen University, where the anti-Calvinist opinions of the tutors gradually led him to Low Arianism, as it was then called, which afterwards became the distinguishing feature of the Warrington Academy. Aberdeen subsequently conferred upon him the degree of D.D.\n\nReturning from Aberdeen, he was ordained, and after a short period of work as Doddridge’s assistant, he accepted a dissenting congregation at Market Harborough. Bad health made him take up teaching; he tutored Thomas Belsham at Kibworth, which lies between Market Harborough and Leicester; other pupils of Aikin were Newcome Cappe (at an earlier period), Thomas Cogan, and Thomas Simpson.\n\nAt Warrington Academy he was one of the first three tutors in 1757, teaching classics. In 1761, Aikin became tutor in divinity, and was succeeded in his old duties by Joseph Priestley. Priestley says of the tutors: ‘We were all Arians, and the only subject of much consequence on which we differed respected the doctrine of Atonement, concerning which Dr. Aikin held some obscure notions.’\n\nAikin’s health began to fail in 1778; soon afterwards he resigned his tutorship, and died in 1780.\n\nFamily\n\nAikin married Jane, daughter of John Jennings, founder of the academy at Kibworth and a teacher who was influential on the dissenting educational tradition. Their two children were John Aikin, physician and author, and Anna Letitia Barbauld, an author and literary critic who published in multiple genres, including poetry, essays, and children’s literature.\n\nInformation retrieved from Wikipedia.\n\nJohann Reinhold Forster was a German Reformed (Calvinist) pastor and naturalist of partially Scottish descent who made contributions to the early ornithology of Europe and North America. He is best known as the naturalist on James Cook’s second Pacific voyage, where he was accompanied by his son Georg Forster. These expeditions promoted the career of Johann Reinhold Forster and the findings became the bedrock of colonial professionalism and helped set the stage for the future development of anthropology and ethnology. They also laid the framework for general concern about the impact that alteration of the physical environment for European economic expansion would have on exotic societies.\n\nForster’s family originated in the Lords Forrester in Scotland from where his great-grandfather had emigrated after losing most of his property during the rule of Oliver Cromwell along with many other Scots. Forster himself was born in the city of Dirschau (Tczew) in the Crown of Poland. He studied languages and natural history at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, theology at the University of Halle, afterwards serving as a Protestant pastor in Mokry Dwór (Nassenhuben) Pomeranian Voivodship. He married his cousin Elisabeth Nikolai. They had several children including a son, Georg Forster and a daughter Virginia Viktoria.\n\nIn 1765 he accepted an offer made to him by the Russian government to inspect and report upon the new colonies founded on the banks of the Volga, in the province of Saratov. His irritable temper soon involved him in difficulties with the Russian government, and in the following year he went with Georg (the eldest of eight children, seven of which survived childhood) to England and became teacher of natural history at Warrington, Lancashire.\n\nHe spent three years teaching at the Warrington Academy, succeeding Joseph Priestley. Compelled by his violent temper to resign this appointment, Forster then moved with his son to London, where they earned a precarious living by doing translations. In 1771, he published A Catalogue of the Animals of North America, which listed the region’s mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.\n\nWhen Joseph Banks withdrew at the last moment as naturalist on Cook’s second voyage, Forster and his son were appointed to fill the vacant position. In July 1772 they set sail on the Resolution, returning to England in July 1775. During a stop in Cape Town, Forster engaged Anders Sparrman to act as his assistant.\n\nBoth the Forsters kept detailed diaries of everything they saw on the voyage, and made extensive collections of both natural history specimens and artefacts. The first publication after the voyage was Characteres generum plantarum, a book on the botany of the South Pacific. Based on his father’s journals, Georg published A Voyage Round the World in 1777. Reinhold Forster published Observations Made during a Voyage round the World (1778). However the income from the book was insufficient to clear his debts, and the bulk of Georg’s drawings from the voyage had to be sold to Joseph Banks. During the next few years Forster undertook a variety of writing work, including a German translation of Thomas Pennant’s Arctic Zoology.\n\nJohann Reinhold’s “Observations Made During a Voyage Round the World” (1778) and Georg’s “A Voyage Round the World” (1777), mark a key moment in the beginnings of modern racism. “Employing the English word “race” as a synonym for human variety, they interpret the multiplicity of Polynesian culture in terms of a linear hierarchy that naturally ascends towards the white European ideal.”\n\nIn November 1779 Forster was appointed Professor of Natural history and Mineralogy at the University of Halle, and director of the Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, where he remained until his death. His Descriptiones animalium, completed within a month of returning to England with Cook, was eventually edited by Hinrich Lichtenstein and published in 1844.\n\nForster’s contributions to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (1772–73) on zoology, ornithology, and ichthyology established him as one of the earliest authorities on North American zoology.\n\nForster was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1793.\n\nThe standard author abbreviation J.R.Forst. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\n\nInformation retrieved from Wikipedia.\n\nJoseph Priestley FRS 24 March 1733 – 6 February 1804) was an English chemist, natural philosopher, separatist theologian, grammarian, multi-subject educator, and liberal political theorist who published over 150 works. He has historically been credited with the independent discovery of oxygen in 1774 by the thermal decomposition of mercuric oxide, having isolated it. Although Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele also has strong claims to the discovery, Priestley published his findings first. Scheele discovered it by heating potassium nitrate, mercuric oxide, and many other substances in about 1772.\n\nPriestley was born to an established English Dissenting family (i.e. they did not conform to the Church of England) in Birstall, near Batley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was the oldest of six children born to Mary Swift and Jonas Priestley, a finisher of cloth. To ease his mother’s burdens, Priestley was sent to live with his grandfather around the age of one. He returned home, five years later, after his mother died. When his father remarried in 1741, Priestley went to live with his aunt and uncle, the wealthy and childless Sarah and John Keighley, 3 miles (4.8 km) from Fieldhead. Because Priestley was precocious—at the age of four he could flawlessly recite all 107 questions and answers of the Westminster Shorter Catechism—his aunt sought the best education for the boy, intending him for the ministry. During his youth, Priestley attended local schools where he learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Priestley’s considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of carbonated water, his writings on electricity, and his discovery of several “airs” (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed “dephlogisticated air” (oxygen). Priestley’s determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the chemical revolution eventually left him isolated within the scientific community.\n\nIn 1761, Priestley moved to Warrington in Cheshire and assumed the post of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at the town’s Dissenting academy, although he would have preferred to teach mathematics and natural philosophy. He fitted in well at Warrington, and made friends quickly. These included the doctor and writer John Aikin, his sister the children’s author Anna Laetitia Aikin, and the potter and businessman Josiah Wedgwood. Wedgwood met Priestley in 1762, after a fall from his horse. Wedgwood and Priestley met rarely, but exchanged letters, advice on chemistry, and laboratory equipment. Wedgwood eventually created a medallion of Priestley in cream-on-blue jasperware.\n\nOn 23 June 1762, Priestley married Mary Wilkinson of Wrexham. Of his marriage, Priestley wrote:\n\nThis proved a very suitable and happy connexion, my wife being a woman of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.\n\nOn 17 April 1763, they had a daughter, whom they named Sarah after Priestley’s aunt.\n\nEducator and historian\n\nAll of the books Priestley published while at Warrington emphasised the study of history; Priestley considered it essential for worldly success as well as religious growth. He wrote histories of science and Christianity in an effort to reveal the progress of humanity and, paradoxically, the loss of a pure, “primitive Christianity”.\n\nBy the time he died in 1804, Priestley had been made a member of every major scientific society in the Western world and he had discovered numerous substances.\n\nThis is an abridged profile of Priestley’s life. Much has been written on his life and available online, including at Wikipedia, where these notes are extracted from.\n\nThomas Percival FRS FRSE FSA was an English physician, health reformer, ethicist and author who wrote an early code of medical ethics. He drew up a pamphlet with the code in 1794 and wrote an expanded version in 1803, Medical Ethics; or, a Code of Institutes and Precepts, Adapted to the Professional Conduct of Physicians and Surgeons in which he coined the expression “medical ethics”. He was a founding subscriber of the Portico Library in Manchester and a pioneering campaigner for public health measures and factory regulation in the city.\n\nBackground\n\nHe was born in Warrington, Lancashire, the son of Joseph Percival and his wife, Margaret Orred. He lost both his parents when he was three years old, so his older sister was responsible for his early education. Once he was old enough, he was placed in a private academy in his home town. He also spent time at the Boteler Grammar School, Warrington. He was enrolled as one of the first students at Warrington Academy in 1756. He achieved a good reputation in classical and theological studies.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1761 he went to study Medicine at Edinburgh University. He did further postgraduate study at Leyden University in Holland and obtained his doctorate (MD) in 1765.\n\nHe became a fellow to the Royal Society in the same year, through a recommendation by his friend and patron Lord Willoughby de Parham. In 1771 he hosted Benjamin Franklin in Manchester, who went on to be a guest of Rev. John Michell at Thornhill Rectory; other guests being Joseph Priestley and Messrs. Smeaton, Pringle and Ingenhousz. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1789.\n\nAfter working as a physician in Warrington from 1765, Percival took a similar post in Manchester from 1767. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1786 and to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1787. He was a prominent member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he was a founder member and served as president during 1782-1804\n\nPercival holds an important place in the history of epidemiology for his analysis of the Bills of Mortality from 1772–6, and for his code of medical ethics. The latter was initially circulated privately as a book on jurisprudence in 1794 and as a result of solicited comments from colleagues then published in an expanded form with a change in title to Medical ethics in 1803. Percival had been asked by the Manchester Royal Infirmary to help with an internal dispute and became particularly concerned with the divisions that had arisen among the different branches of the profession – the physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries with their different backgrounds of training (university, hospital, and apprenticeship respectively). But he did not merely concern himself with intraprofessional relationships: he also laid down a code for conduct towards patients, whether rich or poor, and his ideas were rapidly taken up by the USA, Australia, and Canada — in fact, the ethical code introduced by the newly formed American Medical Association in 1847 used several passages taken directly from his book.\n\nHe died in Manchester on 30 August 1804 and is buried at Warrington Church.\n\nOccupational health and medical ethics\n\nPercival is also known for his early work in Occupational health. He led a group of doctors to supervise textile mills, their report influenced Robert Peel’s to introduce the Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802. The legislation stipulated that children could work only 12 hours per day, walls had to be washed, and visitors had to be admitted to factories so that they could make health-related suggestions.\n\nPercival’s Medical Ethics served as a key source for the American Medical Association (AMA) code, adopted in 1847. Though hyperbolic in its recognition of Percival, the AMA itself states:\n\nThe most significant contribution to Western medical ethical history subsequent to Hippocrates was made by Thomas Percival, an English physician, philosopher, and writer. In 1803, he published his Code of Medical Ethics. His personality, his interest in sociological matters, and his close association with the Manchester Infirmary led to the preparation of a scheme of professional conduct relative to hospitals and other charities from which he drafted the code that bears his name.\n\nAs one expert writes, “The Percivalian code asserted the moral authority and independence of physicians in service to others, affirmed the profession’s responsibility to care for the sick, and emphasized individual honor.” Percival was a devout Christian.\n\nFamily\n\nPercival was married to Elizabeth Basnett.\n\nJohn Aikin was an English medical doctor and surgeon. Later in life he devoted himself wholly to biography and writing in periodicals.\n\nHe was born at Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, son of Dr John Aikin (profiled earlier), Unitarian divine, and received his elementary education at the Nonconformist academy at Warrington, where his father was a tutor. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and in London under Dr. William Hunter. He practised as a surgeon at Chester and Warrington. Finally, he went to Leiden in Holland, earned an M.D. in 1780, and in 1784 established himself as a doctor in Great Yarmouth.\n\nIn 1792, one of his pamphlets having given offence, he moved to London, where he practised as a consulting physician. He lived in Church Street, Stoke Newington. However, he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties, and he began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits, to which his contributions were incessant. When Richard Phillips founded The Monthly Magazine in 1796, Aikin was its first editor. In conjunction with his sister, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, he published a popular series of volumes entitled Evenings at Home (6 vols, 1792–1795), for elementary family reading, which were translated into almost every European language.\n\nWorks\n\nIn 1798 Aikin retired altogether from medicine and devoted himself to literary undertakings such as his General Biography (10 vols, 1799–1815). His other work included Biographical Memoirs of Medicine in Great Britain (1780), The Arts of Life… described in a series of letters. For the instruction of young persons (1802, reprinted 1807), and The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher (1812).\n\nApart from editing The Monthly Magazine (1796–1807) and Dodsley’s Annual Register (1811–1815), Aikin produced a paper called The Athenaeum in 1807–1809, not to be confused with the well-known magazine The Athenaeum (1828–1921).\n\nFamily\n\nAikin had four children, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Arthur, was a prominent scientist, and the youngest, Edmund, an architect. The second son, Charles, was adopted by Aikin’s sister, who had no children. Through Charles, Aikin was grandfather to the writer Anna Letitia Le Breton. His daughter Lucy was a biographer, who in 1823 published Memoir of John Aikin, M.D., with a selection of Miscellaneous Pieces, Biographical, Moral and Critical.\n\nInformation retrieved from Wikipedia.\n\nArthur Aikin, FLS, FGS, was an English chemist, mineralogist and scientific writer, and was a founding member of the Chemical Society (now the Royal Society of Chemistry). He first became its treasurer in 1841, and later became the society’s second president.\n\nHe was born in Warrington, Lancashire into a distinguished literary family of prominent Unitarians. The best known of these was his paternal aunt, Anna Letitia Barbauld, a woman of letters who wrote poetry and essays as well as early children’s literature. His father, Dr John Aikin, was a medical doctor, historian, and author. His grandfather, also called John (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with Warrington Academy. His sister Lucy (1781–1864) was a historical writer. Their brother Charles was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.\n\nArthur Aikin studied chemistry under Joseph Priestley in the New College at Hackney, and gave attention to the practical applications of the science. In early life he was a Unitarian minister for a short time. Aikin lectured on chemistry at Guy’s Hospital for thirty-two years. He became the President of the British Mineralogical Society in 1801 for five years up until 1806 when the Society merged with the Askesian Society. From 1803 to 1808 he was editor of the Annual Review. In 1805 Aiken also became a Proprietor of the London Institution, which was officially founded in 1806. He was one of the founders of the Geological Society of London in 1807 and was its honorary secretary in 1812–1817. He also gave lectures in 1813 and 1814. He contributed papers on the Wrekin and the Shropshire coalfield, among others, to the transactions of that society. His Manual of Mineralogy was published in 1814. Later he became the paid Secretary of the Society of Arts and later was elected as a Fellow. He was founder of the Chemical Society of London in 1841, being its first Treasurer and, between 1843 and 1845, second president.\n\nIn order to support himself, outside of his work with the British Mineralogical Society, the London Institution and the Geological Society, Aiken worked as a writer, translator and lecturer to the public and to medical students at Guy’s Hospital. His writing and journalism were useful for publicising foreign scientific news to the wider British public. He was also a member of the Linnean Society and in 1820 joined the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n\nHe was highly esteemed as a man of sound judgement and wide knowledge. Aikin never married, and died at Hoxton in London in 1854.\n\nPublications\n\nJournal of a Tour through North Wales and Part of Shropshire with Observations in Mineralogy and Other Branches of Natural History (London, 1797)\n\nA Manual of Mineralogy (1814; ed. 2, 1815)\n\nA Dictionary of Chemistry and Mineralogy (with his brother C. R. Aikin), 2 vols. (London, 1807, 1814).\n\nFor Rees’s Cyclopædia he wrote articles about Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, but the topics are not known.\n\ninformation retrieved from Wikipedia.\n\nJames Kendrick, topographer, was born in Warrington and graduated M.D. at Edinburgh on 1 Aug. 1833.\n\nHe had a large practice at Warrington, and also cultivated a taste for antiquities. He frequently lectured on local topography and history. Many papers from his pen appeared in the publications of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, Chester Archaeological Society, the ‘Reliquary,’ and ‘Warrington Guardian.’\n\nIn 1853 he became a member of the British Archaeological Association. During the same year he published ‘An Account of Excavations made at the Mote Hill, Warrington,’ 8vo, Liverpool, 1853, and ‘Profiles of Warrington Worthies,’ 4to, Warrington, 1853 (2nd edit., 1854), illustrated with silhouette likenesses. He wrote in 1856 an amusing ‘Account of the Loyal Warrington Volunteers of 1798.’\n\nIn 1859 he took charge of the antiquities in the Warrington Museum, and added greatly to the collection. He spared neither time nor money in prosecuting the excavations at the Roman station at Wilderspool, near Warrington, which (with Dr. Robson) he thought might be the Condate of Antonine. All the remains discovered there were presented by him to the museum. He increased the value of the gift by compiling in 1872 an excellent ‘Guide Book’ to the collection.\n\nAfter his death his daughter handed over to the museum his fine collection of ecclesiastical and medieval seals and his bequest of one hundred volumes. To the public library he gave more than three hundred books bearing a Warrington imprint.\n\nHe died in Warrington 6 April 1882. A memoir of him in the ‘Palatine Note-Book’ (ii. 113–16, 179–80) gives his portrait and a list of his writings, including many contributed to newspapers and antiquarian periodicals. He was married three times. The more important of his other publications are:\n\n‘A Description of two Ancient Chess Men discovered in the Mote Hill, Warrington,’ 1852.\n\n‘A Morning’s Ramble in Old Warrington,’ 1855.\n\n‘An Account of Warrington Siege, anno 1643,’ 1856.\n\n‘The Warrington Blue Coat School Exposure, and its Beneficial Results,’ 1868.\n\n‘Memorials of the late Dr. Robson of Warrington, by William Robson and Dr. Kendrick.’\n\n[Warrington Advertiser, 8 and 15 April 1882; Manchester Guardian, 11 April 1882; Journal of Brit.

Her father, Leslie Knight Wilson was a chartered accountant; her mother, Brenda (née Naylor) a French teacher. She attended Broomfields Junior School and Bridgewater High School. Wilson studied at Clare College, Cambridge, completing a BA, Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics (later converted to an MMath) and PhD in mathematics. Her PhD thesis, titled “Shear Flow Instabilities in Viscoelastic Fluids”, was supervised by John Rallison. On graduation she moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where she began research on suspension mechanics with Rob Davis in the Chemical Engineering department.\n\nMathematical work\n\nIn 2000 Wilson returned to the UK to take up a lectureship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Leeds. In 2004 she moved to UCL, where she is Professor of Applied Mathematics and as of September 2018, Head of Department. Wilson is the first female to hold the position of Head of Mathematics at UCL.\n\nResearch in fluid mechanics\n\nWilson’s PhD thesis and early papers focused on instabilities in viscoelastic fluids. She predicted a new instability in channel flow of a shear-thinning fluid which was later discovered experimentally by another group and on which she still works. She has also worked on instabilities in shear-banding flows and in more complex geometries.\n\nHer other major research interest, besides viscoelasticity, is suspension mechanics, and in particular the effect of particle contacts on fluid rheology. Her most recent projects draw these two fields together, investigating the interaction of solid particles with their complex material environment in fields ranging from healthcare to engineering.\n\nHer academic publications are listed on the UCL site.\n\nOne of her best-known publications is the paper “The fluid dynamics of the chocolate fountain”, co-authored with Adam Townsend. Unusually for a mathematical paper, this was covered in the Washington Post.\n\nKnowledge transfer\n\nWilson gave the 2019 Joint London Mathematical Society Annual Lecture on “Toothpaste, custard and chocolate: mathematics gets messy”.\n\nProblem plastics & how mathematics can help, published in UCL Science and presented at Mathematics Works (Oct 2007).\n\nPublic lecture: From gases to gloops: Instabilities in fluids in the UCL Lunch Hour Lecture series on 23 February 2016.\n\nNon-technical articles\n\nCase study for the Royal Society on how a supportive employer can support a mother on her return to work.\n\nBlog post and BBC World TV news interview commenting on the award of the Fields Medal to a female mathematician for the first time.\n\nThe D’Hondt method Explained: brief explanation of an easier way to understand the allocation of seats at the European elections.\n\nBooks\n\nPractical Analytical Methods for PDEs in volume 1 of the LTCC Advanced Mathematics series, World Scientific, 2015.\n\nIn 2016, Wilson co-authored with Dame Celia Hoyles a chapter of the book “Mathematics: How It Shaped Our World”\n\nRecognition\n\nWilson is an editor of the Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics and the Journal of Engineering Mathematics. She is a member of the Editorial Advisory Board for Physics of Fluids.\n\nShe was president (for the 2015–2017 term) of the British Society of Rheology the first woman to hold this position.\n\nIn 2014 she was a member of the subject panel for Mathematics on ALCAB (the A Level Content Advisory Board), advising on the reforms to A Level Mathematics for first teaching in September 2016.\n\nShe was a Council Member and is now the Vice-President (Learned Societies) of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.\n\nInformation retrieved from Wikipedia."
