        "text": "The First Book.\n\nPEireskius was descended from that most ancient Familie of the Fabrii or Fabricii, whose Originall was from Pisa in Italy, being transferred from thence into this Province in the daies of St. Lewis, so called, King of France, and in the year of our Lord, one thousand two hundred Fifty and Four. For our Histories record that Hugo Fabrius making one among the Gentlemen of Pisa, that had enga∣ged themselves in the holy War, was by St. Lewis aforesaid brought into the Coasts of Provence, when returning out of the East he landed at Yeres, Arcas, or Nieras, which was anciently termed Olbia. Where being detained by sick∣nesse, and commended by the King at his depar∣ture, he grew into so much favour and became so powerfull with the chief Men of that Place, as to be able to compose their differences, when they contended about the Government of the Castle and City. After which, marrying a wife out of the Sollerien Family, he setled himself to make his constant abode at Yeres. That place be∣ing afterwards assigned for the Princes patrimo∣ny, he was chosen Provost or Governor thereof, in the year—70. by Charles the First, Earle of\n\nProvence and King of Sicilie, who loved him as dearly as King Lewis did. Soon after he began to make divers Fortifications both in the City and in the Castle; but his Son Aycardus finish∣ed what he had begun, leaving his name to one or the Gates which even at this day is corruptly called Casabria. Hugo Fabricius had another Son besides Aycard, named Paul, whom Charles the second made chief Judge of Marseilles: Also another named William, who having returned safe from divers travels, built an Hospitall for the accommodation of Pilgrims going to and coming from the holy Land. But, to be short, there succeeded these a noble Progenie, renown∣ed for seats of Armes, Learning and Piety; who in their severall Ages and Families were Gover∣nors of Regium, Spinosa, Gramusa, Saint-Julian, St. Janit, St. Laurence, Laverna, Calase, Pe∣••risea, Ʋalvesium, and Riantium.\n\nYet, for all our haste Antony must not be passed over in silence, who was the Grandchild of Ay∣cardus in the Fourth Generation: to whom and to his Son Raimond, there are extant to be read at this day in Nostredame very civill letters of King Renatus, which he wrote when he was about to undertake his Expedition for Naples. Raymond was brought up with Renatus from a Child, in the Court of King Lewis, the second; and besides Antony, he had another sonne called Amadis who because he was the younger brother, he bore in his Coat of Armes which was a swart Lion in a Golden field, a scarlet label for distincti∣on sake. It is recorded, that he also was Go∣vernour of Eres, and of intimate acquaintance with Charles the Third, to whom the King of\n\nFrance, did soon succeed. From him the fami∣lie was again divided into two Branches: for he had two Sons Fulke and William, both of them expert Souldiers and skillfull in the Lawes. For having borne Armes in the Expedition of Pid∣mont, after their return they gave themselves wholly to the study of the Laws. For, William the younger being adopted by his great Uncle Elziarius Portanerius Brinoniensis a learned Man; he went to Orleance and Vierron to study the Laws; and having married a wife who was an Arvernian, he setled his abode in that Country: & to expresse his gratitude he took unto himself the Coat of Armes of the House of Portaneria, which was a Bende with Roses argent, in a field Azure. And he left behind him, besides Hugh a famous Lawyer, another Son named John, the father of a∣nother John, who begat another John, the Father of that John who is now Master of Requests, having two Honourable Ladies to his Sisters viz. the Lady Magdalena wife to the ilustrious Chancellor of France & the Lady Mary, wife to Philbertus Pom∣padorius Viceroy or Governour of the Limosins.\n\nBut Fulke after the Supreame Senate was erected at Aix, in the beginning of the sorego∣ing Age, did plead causes with great commen∣dation, and was many times by the Governours of that Province taken in, to sit with them as an Assistant, and employed more then once to Lewis the twelfth, and to Francis the first. Who perceiving the Learning and Integritie of Fulke, made him a Senator by his bare command, in the year—32. And when the Emperour Charles was about to invade Provence, he joyned him as Counsellour to Annaeus Monmorantius Ge∣nerall\n\nof his Majesties Forces. Also that good Advice is worthy to be recorded which he gave to Monmorancie which he also practised, transport∣ing the ancient Records of the Crown into the Castle of Baulcs; by which meanes those preci∣ous Monuments escaped burning, when as af∣terwards the Palace of Aix, was fired by the Duke of Savoy his Souldiers. Moreover, when the City could not hold out against the Emperours forces, he advised the Cittizens to withdraw themselves, and that they might not leave any thing therein to relieve the Enemie, he began in so good earnest to exhort them to destroy their food and what else might advantage the Enemie, that he himself was the first that emptied his Granarie into a well, and staved his vessels of Wine and Oyle and let them run about the Streets. Fulke being dead, his Son Nicolaus was made a Senator in the year—45. whose virtue also was taken notice of, not only by Claudius Sabau∣dus Governour of Provence and Earle of Tenda; but also by Charles the 9th. himself. Who ta∣king away the Senate, and setting in place there∣of a Coutt of ten Chief-Justices, it was his plea∣sure that Nicolaus should be one of the ten: and he gave of his own accord to his Brother Charles after he had brought his forces off, from the Ex∣pedition of Corsica, and behaved himself there exceeding Valiantly, the Lordship of Brigantium to him and his Heires.\n\nAnd now that we may draw near to the Father of our Peireskius, Nicolaus left two Sons, Claudi∣us and Reginaldus. Claudius had a small and infirme body, but a mind truly generous and mettlesome; so that from the year —72.\n\nin which he was invested with the Honour and Dignity of his Father and Grandfather, he was much renowned both in the Senate and the whole Province, and exceeding favoured by Henricus Engolismensis great Master of the French Knights of Malta, and Viceroy of Pro∣vence. But Reginald being brought up from a boy with Renata Dutchess of Ferraria and Daugh∣ter of Lewis the twelfth, when shee betook her self to passe over her old daies at Montargis, he gave himself to study the Law, and was made one of the Lords of the Subsidies and the Church's Patrimony; and a Master of the accounts. And when those troublesome times of the Henotick faction or league happened, he and his Brother remained constant in their Loialtie to the King, & (which Bernardus Nogaretius Valletanus at that time Viceroy, counted a notable piece of service) he procured by the power that he had the Castle of Eres and all that Coast to revolt from the Duke of Savoy. And whereas his Brother lived a single life he himself married Margareta Bom∣paria, who of her Fathers side was descended from Knights and Praesidents; and on her Mo∣thers side shee did belong to the families of Valle∣voria and Forbinus. Now we have heard it re∣ported, that shee was of so neat and comely a countenance, and so composed; that when Catharina Medicea the Queen Mother was visited at Aix by the Ladies of that place, shee made choice of her alone among all the rest upon whom he would vouchsafe to bestow the honour of a Kisse, And this Reginaldus Fabrius it was, and this very Margarcta Bomparia, whom our Peireskius of whom we treat did acknowledge for his Parents.\n\nBut because he was born at Beaugensier; we must take notice that this Towne is seated in a very straight yet exceeding pleasant valley, en∣riched by the Interfluxe of the same River Gapell, It is distant from Tolon on this hand, and from Eres on that, just as far as those Cities are distant one from the other, namely, about three Pro∣vince mi••es; and being seated North of both, it likewise far excells them in goodnesse of Aire. The nearnesse of situation was the cause, that his Ancestors having their abode at Eres, did not only procure certaine Country houses in that Towne, but in their retirement thither, they dwelt in an ancient Castle, which is now de∣molished: for the House with those goodly Gar∣dens joyning to it, was not yet built; into which that water might more safely and plentifully be derived from the adjacent River, Claudius built a fair Aqnaeduct or Conduit.\n\nPeireskius therefore was born in the Castle of Belgenser or Beaugensier aforesaid, when his Parents did retire thither by reason of that me∣morable Pestilence, which, in the year 1580. began to rage all over Provence, but especially at Aix. He was born upon the first day of De∣cember in the year aforesaid, near upon seven a-Clock in the Evening. Which I therefore men∣tion, that I may not seeme negligent touching the Circumstance of time; but not to give an occasion to Fortune-tellers, to calculate his Nativitie, and tell his destinie after his Death, with more certainty then they were able to do, during his life. For it is wonderfull to consider how many lies the Astrologers have told, either in respect of years which he never lived, or of Wife\n\nand Children & other things which he never had; or touching many other things which he attained. Moreover, his Parents having lived together di∣vers years without a Child; his Mother for that cause, as soon as she perceived that shee was great, with child shee took up a resolution that the Childs Godfather should be no Noble Man; but, such was her pietie, the first poor man they should meet with. Whereupon, when he was carried to be Christened, they called the first poor man they met, and he answered for him at the Font as Godfather, and named him by his Uncles name Claudius. But his Uncle coming in just as they were conferring the name, he would have him called likewise by his Grandfathers name, where∣upon he was called Nicolaus. Claudius. Neverthe∣lesse not only while he was a Child he was commonly called Nicolas without the Additi∣on of Claudius: but also when he was well in years, even as also Authors terme him frequently Nicolaus Faber, Fabrius, or Fabricius. And here we may take notice of a great mistake of the learned John Selden, who takes that same Nico∣las Faber who is cited by Baronius and was Scoole-Master to the most Christian King Lewis the Thirteenth, for our Faber Peireskius. For in his preface to the History of Eadmerus Cantu∣ariensis, mentioning those Epistles of Lantfrank recorded by Baronius, in the eleventh tome of his Annals; He acknowledges himself (saies Selden) if I mistake not that he received the Copie from that most renowned and Learned man Nicolas Faber Petriscius, a worthy Judge of the Court of Aquens, and my very much honoured freind. And indeed Baronius cites Nicolas Faber, but he adds Pari∣siensis not Petriscum, which Epithet was given\n\nthis Faber of ours from a Town in his Mothers juridiction, which is called in Latin Petriscum and in French commonly Peiresc, from whence he had his most renowned name; which I to the end it might be rightly pronounced, have render∣ed it Peireskium, and not as many others Peres∣cium, Perezium, or the like.\n\nIt is reported that when he was hardly two months old, an ancient woman that was a witch entered the Chamber, and threw down before his Mother an hatchet, which shee held in her hand, saying that shee had brought it her againe; from which time the mother lost her speech, and the child his crying; and both their heads were so depressed upon one shoulder, and held so stifly in that posture, that they could not bend them. The story saies further, that when his Uncle knew it, he caused the Old Woman to be beaten who was found in the chimney with her neck upon one of her shoulders, who as soon as ever shee lifted up her head to signifie that shee had beating enough and to desire them to hold their hands, shee said, which appeared to be true, That the mother and the Child were both well. This I heard, not only from others, but from Peireskius himself, who did relate the story to me just as his Uncle was wont to tell it. Doubtlesse tis a very strange thing, that an Old Hag bowing her own neck, should dart out spi∣rits with so strong a Nerve, as to turn the Head of one distant from her, in like manner aside, and tye the tongue of another with the like vio∣lence to it, wherewith shee held her own; so that neither their Heads could be stirred, nor their tongues loosed, untill shee remitting of her ri∣gor\n\nshould let loose the distended, yet, as it were, unsensible strings. Many such accidents as these are usually referred to the Devil; yet, though the most good God may suffer innocent babes to be∣come the objects of their malice; and though Sa∣tan may some wayes make use of miserable old women to such intents and purposes; yet (I say) it is a clear case, that the greatest part of these stories are fables, or have no other foundation than the symptoms of certain diseases, to which Infants are subject; Also it is certain, that these tales are most frequent in the countrey among the common people, whose credulity is awaken∣ed and cherished by every sleight occasion.\n\nA yeer and an half after, viz. in the moneth of June, in the yeer 1582, famous for the reforma∣tion of the Calendar then made, he had a brother born who was named Palamedes. This is he who was afterwards, from some place where he had jurisdiction, called Valavesius; at what time also Nicolas began to be called Peireskius. For till they had past their youths-age, they were called sometimes Fabricii, otherwhiles Calasii, which name was commoly given to their father and uncle from a town called Calasum, which they governed. When Palamedes was born, his father was absent about businesse at Grenoble: and his mother died the second moneth after he was born, being 22 yeers old. And their father Regi∣nald took another wife, but not till fourteen yeers after. Her name was Catharina Vassalla Ca∣radetea, being descended from illustrious ance∣stours both on father and mothers side: her an∣cestours on the fathers side were princes of A∣chaia; by her mothers side they were allied to\n\nthe Fliscani of Genoa. She was a widow when he married her (having had for her former hus∣band Olivarius de Thulia, one of the Senatours) with one only daughter living, named Marchisa, who was afterwards married to Palamedes. By this second marriage, he had besides other chil∣dren, which all died either in their childhood or youths-age; Susanna who is yet living, being married to Henricus Seguiranus, the first President of the Masters of the Accounts, and of the patri∣moniall Senatours.\n\nTo return to Nicolas, he alwayes looked upon, and respected his uncle as another father, and that not without cause. For he intending that he should succeed him in his Dignity, took especiall care to give him ingenuous education, judging that it was in vain for a child to be happily born, and not liberally educated. And he was so much the more encouraged to be carefull in this point, because he saw in him even from the cradle, a vertnous mind adorned and rendered more ami∣able by a beautifull body. For he was scarcely weaned from the breast, when he began to disco∣ver his Genius, being very attentive to whatever he saw and heard: and he was alwayes accusto∣med with a most pleasing countenance and sweet voice, to demand of his nurse, his father, his ma∣ster, and of any else that came in his way, what every thing was, and how and wherefore it was made. So when he was first taught his letters, and delighted to be handling of books and papers, he would frequently ask what was the argument handled in those books, and because he took it hainously that any should make answer, that it was above his capacity to understand, they were\n\nfain to invent somewhat or other, and relate it to him as the argument of the said books, which he might hear with pleasure. These things indeed are small matters in themselves, but worthy con∣sideration in regard of his yeers, and that it is a pleasure to see trees bearing fair buds and blos∣soms. Old men, I am sure, have admired these things and told them to me, avouching that he never was taken with, nor never relished any childish thing.\n\nWhen he was seven yeers old, and was educa∣ted with his brother at Brinonia, where the Court of Subsidies and Accounts were then kept, be∣cause the pestisence was at Aix, he desired that he might be instructed in the San-Maximitan Col∣ledge, which had the repute to flourish in the stu∣dies of learning. Nor is it a thing to be past over in silence, how he perswaded his father, to com∣mit his brother, being younger, to his care, that he might oversee his young studies: nor must it be forgotten, how he was from this time for∣ward, in stead both of a father and a master to his brother; and how his brother did reverence him both as a paret and master, A yeer being passed over, and the plague beginning at Sanmaximi∣nus, they were called to Belgenser, and a yeer after from thence to Aix, where their uncle then abode.\n\nAfterwards when the civil wars grew hot upon the death of Henry the third, they were sent to Avenion, where they studied five whole yeers in the Jesuites Colledge. And Peireskius was wont to relate, that he was much indebted to Antonius Colombatius, and Andreas Valladerius; whom he heard, they being the chief Professors of Huma∣nity.\n\nFor he said they were wont to abate him somewhat in other studies, that he might surely addict himself to the reading of Histories, not neglecting in the mean while the studie of poe∣trie, and of the Greek tongue. For those Learn∣ed men rejoyced that there was not so much need to guide his Course, as to shew him the way a far off; for which they deserve Commendations, in that they would not burthen his Noble brest with that servitude, which makes many altoge∣ther hate the studies of Humanity and polite li∣terature; or too much to accustome themselves to mean matters. Also he was wont to tell how mightily he was encouraged, when they also publikely commended him, because he had the whole History of Justin, and the Metamorphosis of Ovid at his fingers ends; and could never make an end of consulting with Books, whereby he might come to know all the particular circum∣stances of every matter. For which cause he was a verse unto all plaies and shews; that he might give himself wholly to the reading and transcrib∣ing of all particularities. Wherein I conceive he over did; for the mind must be unbent by fits, nor must a man study presently after meat; which because the Overseer of his studies were not suf∣ficiently carefull of, hence it came that he was pained oftentimes, in his stomack and in his head.\n\nHe had well high finished the 15. year of his Age, when he returned to Aix, where he studi∣ed Philosophie an whole year. His Uncle was desirous that he should Learn in the mean while to handle Armes, ride the Horse and exercise his limbs with dancing. But because these ex∣ercises\n\nrobbed him of other more pleasing houres, he performed them indded, to please his Uncle, but no longer then his Masters were by that taught him; for he would never practise by himself: so much better did he account it, to be alwaies reading, writing or hearing some point of Learn∣ing. About this time there was brought to his Uncle, a peice of Golden Coine of Arcadius, which was found at Belgenser. He presently desired to have it, and when he had read the Letters about it, and had set down the Emperors name whose Coine it was, he brought it present∣ly to his Uncle again, who to gratifie him, gave him not only two other peices of ancient Coine, but also Books, by which he might be further instructed in the knowledge of such Antiquities. And from this time forwards his most curious mind began to burn like fire in a wood for he be∣gan eagerly to seek out, and collect all the ancient Coines which he could come by, being eagerly bent to read and Interpret their Inscriptions, up∣on which occasion also he began to seek out all kind of Inscriptions, whether belonging to Sepul∣chers or others, and studiously to observe them.\n\nThen he was sent with his Brother to Turney, that he might there go through a Course of Philo∣sophie (as they were wont to call it) his Brother being as yet taken up with Humanitie. And being in a special maner inflamed with the study of the Mathematicks, he eagerly drunke in that Cos∣mographie which was there taught, assuring him∣selfe that History without it and Chronologie, was altogether in the dark and unintelligible. And therefore after the use of the Sphere he Learnt the use of the Astrolabe; write∣ing\n\ndivers Letters to a workman, and expostu∣lating the matter with him, because he had long since promised to make him an Astrolabe, but had been negligent in the performance of his promise. In that mean season, he abated nothing in his studies of Antiquity (upon which account he was dearly affected by Petrus Royerus one of the professors) nor in his studies of Humanitie in generall, in which he was as it were his Bro∣thers Master and Instructer. But to do all this he was fain to sit up late in the night at his study. Hence it was that partly by reason of the naturall weaknesse of his Constitution, partly by his conti∣nuall labours and late watchings, he encreased the weaknesse of his stomach formerly contracted, which made him use a powder which in his Let∣ters to his Father, he called his Digessive pow∣der. And because I have mentioned his Letters, it is seasonable to observe, that from this time forward, he was accurate in his style, writing his Letters over and over againe in severall pa∣pers, which it has been my hap to view; by which it is appatent that he used no phrases which were luxuriaot or undigested. For he evermore expressed what he intended with common words; yet not without that Elegancy and civilitie, with which in testifying his good will, observance, and gratitude, in excusing, commending, congratu∣lating, and such like passages, he was admi∣rable. For, to instance, writing to his mother in Law upon occasion of certain Tokens received from her, he thus expressed himself, Foelices videmur, ô mater, quód beneficiis tuis cumulamur: sed infoelices tamen, quando sic illis obrisimur, ut ag∣noscendo impares simus. That is, I account my\n\nself happy, dear mother, in the frequent expressions of your love; yet am I therein unhappie, that their multitude is such, that I cannot sufficiently acknowledge or requite them. And while he wrote thus, he returned the best Tokens he was able; for even in those younger years, he could not endure to be overcome with kindnesse, as far as his ability would give him leave. Sutable hereunto writing to a freind equall to himself in years, and even then hating ingratitude; I would lay violent hands upon my self (saies he) if I might be justly accused of the least neglect of my duty to my freinds. From the same gratefull inclination it was, that he commended the care of his Instructers, that they might by that meanes receive from his Father and Uncle, far larger Gra∣tuities then had been promised.\n\nTo come again to his studies. His Uncle was not willing that he should spend three years upon Philosophie: but after he had spent a year at Tournon, he would needs send for him back again to Aix, that he might study Law, because when time should come, he was to be one of the Senate. This also he desired while he was yet at Tournon, for he wrote unto him that he should timely take in hand the Manuall of Ru∣bricks: but he to deferr yet a little longer the study of Law, wrote thus by way of excuse; Your de∣sire was (Uncle) that I should seriously addict my self to the study of Oratory: That shall therefore, if you please, be now my businesse, because this place is very convenient for that purpose, and I will then begin to study the Law, when I leave this Citty: Howbeit you may please to command me what you shall thinke most couvenient; for if you\n\nshall persist to requirè my returne, I shall in all things shew my self ready to fulfill your pleasure. There∣fore being called home, he addicted himself to study Law under the Turorage of Franciscus For∣tius Andinus, who being an Advocate in the Court at Aix, and very skillful to teach the Lawes, was withall able to compare with any man, in the more polite studies of Humanity. This man being much resected by the Parents of Pei∣reskius, began with much care to read unto him the Institutions; and he himself partly through occasion of this study, and partly that he might not wholly intermit the course of those learned Studies which he had begun, he took in hand of his own Head to make a Catalogue of those Emperors, who had made the Lawes. He made also a Catalogue of the Consuls and other Magistrates in their order, searching every where for their Coines, that he might know the Law∣makers as well by their Countenances as their Acts. Also he endeavoured to get the Pictures of all the most famous Lawyers, that so when he met with any of their Reports and Interpre∣tations, his memorie might be strengthened by calling to minde their Countenances. Also there was at the same time at Aix, Petrus Anto∣nius Rascasius Bagarrius, a most skillfull Anti∣quary: for afterwards Henry the great, moved by the famous report that went of him, sent for him; and made him the Master of his Jewells and Rarities. Peireskius therefore did, at spare times frequently visit him; to question and learn of him, and he admiring his Sagacitie and Learning and friendly embracing his ardent desire of fur∣ther knowledge, joyned with modesty, he\n\ncould not conceale any thing from him; for he both shewed him divers Rarities divers daies together, and also brought forth his Books to strengthen and make good his own conjectures and explications, making no bones to allow and commend the peculiar Interpretations of Pei∣reskius.\n\nWhen the year was over, he went again to Avenion, where he had a private Master named Petrus David, a Burgundiau, who was afterwards a Judge in criminall causes at Semur in his own Country. This man likewise besides his ability in Law, was also well seen in the more polite studies of Humanity and Antiquity; and that made him well content, that Peireskius, to the study of Law, joyned his care in searching after Antiquities. And therefore it was that he wrote frequently to Bagarrius touching Coines and other rarities. Once he sent him a writing of all the Rarities which he had observed in the Closet of one Romeus Arelatensis, and among other things he sent him the pattern of a sculpture of Deianira ravished by Nessus, which was engraven upon a neat Jasper stone. Sometimes also having gained fair pieces of the Coines of Nero and Vitellius, he sent them to his Uncle, beseeching him to beautifie them, and make them like the Hercules and Agrippa, which he had by him adorned. He also entreated him to send him a certaine Ring, which he hoped to change for a Cornelian or Onyx stone, which he he said was graven by a most excellent workman, and of inestimable value though unknown to him that had it. I ser down these passages instead of many others, that it may appear how skillfull\n\nhe was, even at that Age in these kind of Curiosites. But he that most of all did feed his curious mind, was Petrus Antonius Ghibertus of Naples, who was then Auditor to Cardinall Aquaviva. For he shewed him certain rarities such as had never been seen before; and among other books he lent him, for divers daies together, some of Hubortus Goltzius his setting forth, which he had not be∣fore perused. Moreover, seeing that he was of a quick and piercing spirit, he advised him to make a journey into Italie, where he should find, especially at Rome, curiosities wherewith to sa∣tisfie his desires.\n\nHe was 18. years of Age, when thinking to take a journey into Italie, he did learn the Art of swimming. Before that, he was wont in the summer to wash himself in the lesser stream of the River Rhodanus which runs by the Head of the Island Barthalasse and into which the Brook Serga empties it self. Once upon a time he felt the ground which he had wont to find even and fort, to be grown hard with little round balls or bunches, like hard boiled Eggs when their shell is peeled of. At which wondering, he took some of them up and carried them home, that he might shew them to his Master & demand of him the reason. But the miracle was increased when a few daies after returning to the River, he sound those little balls or lumps turned into persect pebble stones, which he observed likewise to be∣fall those which he had carried and laid up at home. And upon this occasion he began to play the Philosopher and to enquire into the Gene∣ration of stones; but of that, hereafter. Finally having a longing desire to visit Rome, and fear∣ing\n\nthat his Parents would not give way, he requested onely that they would send him to Pa∣dua, which was then famous for Law-studies. Now he thought with himself, that the year of Jubilre being at hand; he might upon that occa∣sion go from Padua to Rome.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1599. the Cardi∣nall Joyeux being to return into Italie, intend∣ed to go to Ferrara: Because Pope Clement the second was come thither, to take posessi∣on of that Territorie fallen to him by the Death of Alphonsus Attestinus the second of that name; therefore the Cardinall directed his journey thi∣ther, and not to Rome. And therefore Peires∣kius had a great desire to put himself and his Brother into the Cardinalls retinue; but his Parents consented not. For they resolved to satisfie his laudable desires; but they thought it best that they should stay till Autumne, both that the weather might be more temperate, and that the youths might inure themselves to ano∣ther Climate, rather in the winter then the fol∣lowing summer, as also that necessaries for their journey might be the better provided. For in the first place there was a tutor to seek, who might regulate both their studies and behaviour; though the modestie and discretion of them both, but especially of Peireskius was such; that it was rather a point of Honour, then any matter of necessity to appoint them a Tutor. Wherefore, Paulus Gudanes Fonvivius a Gentlem an of Berne, who was returned from his Travailes in Italie, Poland Germanie, and other Countries and had seen the severall Humors of many Nations and their Cities; and whom the Chancellour\n\nBellevre had resolved to send with his own Son; he was chosen to be their Tutour.\n\nWith him therefore they departed about the beginning of September, and Peireskius chose rather to set out at the Haven of Cannes then any where else, both that he might visit an ancient Monastery situate not far off in the Island Lerius, as also that he might view in passing the ancient Monuments of Freius. When they were come to Geniia and had sufficiently viewed those mag∣nificent Palaces, they were yet to saile by Porto-Venere and L'Ericy; but Peiresk us would go the rest of the way by Land, both because he was sick at Sea, and because he intended curiously to view some things which he had in his mind. For he had made himself by his own Industry a Iour∣nall Book, and was resolved not so to travaile right on from City to City, but if he heard of any thing worthy observation here or there, he would turn out of his rode and go thither, if he had a mind to it. For which cause, he never of his own accord joyned himself in Company with any Strangers; and when others joyned themselves to him, he would use some civill excuse to in∣timate before hand, that they must shortly part Company. And these digressions of his at the very beginning, had like to cost him dear, for turning out of his way to see the Mines of Massa, one of the Baudity or Robbers so called, had so took upon him to be his guide, that un∣lesse shee had been timely discovered, he would have brought him where he should have had his throat cur. Having staid a while at Luca, he desired to view a rare Closet of Curiosities which was at Pisa: but he could not do it before he\n\nhad visited Liburnum, and returned thither again. And I remember among other things which he was wont to tell us he saw there, how he won∣dered most at a sprig of Corall which grew upon a dead mans skull: which I therefore observe, be∣cause this was none of the least reasons which moved him to go and see men fish for Corall: of which we shall speak hereafter in its place.\n\nBriefly to passe over other places, he went from thence thorow Florence, Bononia, Ferra∣ria; and when he had staid a few dayes at Venice, he finally settled his abode at Padua. He had been there hardly a few moneths, when his ver∣tue began to be renowned thorow the whole University. For though he and his brother were frequent hearers and visiters of the Professours of Law, and namely of Jacobus Gallus, Bartholomaeus Silvatcius, Joachimus Scainus, and Ottonellus Pi∣scalcius: yet did he visit all the other learned men of the University, and quickly brought them into an admiration of him. Among the rest Tho∣mas Segetus, the very same whom Lipsius had commended in the third Century of his Epistles, did so testifie his good will and respects unto him, that he put down this by way of preface and title, GENIO GALLIAE NARBONEN∣SIS, INGENIO, ET MATURAE, IM∣MATURO AEVO, NICOLAI FA∣BRICII VIRTUTI SACRUM PRID. NATAL. CHRISTI M.D.IC. that is, To the Genius of Provence in France; to the wit and in unripe yeers ripe vertue of Nicolaus Fabrici∣us, I consecrate this testimoniall. And that rare man Erycius Puteanus, not only praised by Lyp∣sius, and afterward his Successour in the Univer∣sity,\n\nbut now already ordained to be, both the Kings Chronologer, and chief Professour of Ora∣tory at Millain, made use of this following In∣scription: CUI GRATIAE ADOLE∣SCENTIAM ORNANT, ERUDI∣TIO JUVENTAM, PRUDENTIA SENECTAM; IS ADULESCENS VOLUPTATEM AMICIS CREAT, JUVENIS HONOREM PATRIAE, SENEX UTRUMQUE SIBI. TU VERO, NICOLAE FABRICI, CUN∣CTA SIMUL AMICIS, PATRIAE, TIBI; IN SPE AETATIS, ET FLO∣REM JUVENTAE, ET FRUCTUM SENECTAE PROFESSUS. PATA∣VII ∞ DC. KAL. FEBR. That is, He whose youth is adorned by the Graces, his mature age with learning, and his old age with wisdom, is a Pleasure to his frieuds in his youth, an Honour to his Countrey in his riper yeers, and both to himself, in his old age. But as for thee, O Nicolas Fabricius, Thou art all at once to thy Friends, thy Countrey, and thy Self; for in thy hopefull yeers thou discoverest at once both the blossoms of youth and the fruits of old age. Padna, the Kalends of February 1600. And these are the testimoniall Inscriptions, which a∣mong many others I thought good to relate.\n\nAnd as he drew the eyes and attentions of all men, so was he best known and most dear to the renowned Johannes Vincentins Pinellus, who being by originall and blood from Genoa, and born at Naples, made choice of that city, wherein quietly to passe his dayes, giving himself wholly to promote good Arts and ingenuous Literature. For he had provided a most complearly furnisht\n\nLibrary, and a Store-house of all most exquisite rarities and curiosities; so that he furnished all the learned men of that age, both far and near, with such books or other things, as they stood in need of. He being most skilfull in all curious things, did stir up all men to study, and kept open house to entertain the discourses and acquaintance of learned men, both Italians and other Coun∣trey-men. Lipsius, and Scaliger, and Thuanus, and Casaubon, and Pithaeus, have given testimony of his worth; and who not among the learned? He therefore being such a man, fell presently in love with the Genius of Peireskius, as being so very like his own: So that he did both admire and re∣verence vertue and learning grown up and almost come to maturity in a Youth. There are many Letters yet to be seen, whereby he testified the greatest familiarity possible; one while asking his advice in many particulars about coins, the pla∣ces where matters mentioned in stories had been acted, touching the answers which he was to re∣turn to the demands of Ursinus, Velserus, and o∣thers: otherwhiles giving him thanks for his in∣terpretations of hard matters & places in anthors, for sending him books. patterns of rarities, co∣pies of manuscripts, and other things: sometimes by way of requitall sending him such books, rari∣ties, inscriptions, letters, as he had received lately from Rome, or other parts; otherwhiles inviting him to know, discourse, behold, passe his judge∣ment, and the like, all which to particula∣rize would be redious; not to speak of the Letters, which to the number of sourty he wrote to him, when he was at Venice, Flo∣rence, or Rome, all very familiar and full of testi∣fications\n\nof the greatest good will imaginable.\n\nNow Peireskius was wont to go once a quarter to Venice, both to receive moneys to defray his necessary charges by Bils of Exchange, and also to enjoy the society of learned men, lovers of Antiquity, such as Father Paul Sarpi, Dominicus Molinus, and many others; likewise that he might see what ever in that city was of repute for costlinesse or rarity. To which purpose he was very much assisted by the authority of Philippus Canaius Fraxineus, the most Christian King of France his Embassadour there; he himself also making such friends, as by whose authority he at∣tained the sight and knowledge of what ever he desired. The chief of which was Fridericus Con∣tarenus, Procurator of St. Mark, who having a study richly furnished with rarities, was neverthe∣lesse unacquainted with the value thereof, till Peireskius shewed him what every rarity was, and how to be valued; what the Greek Inscriptions both of Moneys and Tombs did signifie, and the like, by which he gained a singular interest in his affections. And not onely in his, but his whole Families, which was the rise of that acquaintance which he had with Angelus Contarenus, when as twenty yeers after he was Embassadour for the Republike in France; and with Vincentius Con∣tarenus, who six yeers after setting out a book of Divers Readings, So far as from France (saith he) the most noble Nicolas Fabricius, excellently skilled both in the Laws and in all Antiquities, did think sit very lovingly to advize me. I passe over Johan∣nes Mocenicus, who had very rare curiosities, I passe over Bembus the Knight, all whose stock of rarities, in a manner, which he had received by\n\ntradition from Cardinall Bembus, he bought up. I passe over the Patriarch of Aquileia, in whose closet he was wont to relate, how he had seen to the number of 300 very rare Achates, or Agats, precious stones so called: besides many others of other kindes. I will onely relate what Putean being at Venice wrote to Pinellus on the 11th of the Kalends of June, in that Epistle of his which is extant, being the 82 of his Promulsis. I was, sayes he, in the house of Scaramellus: I saw the monument of Septumia, though to little purpose: all things were so justly expressed, that verily I know not whether I should more admire the industry or the memory of our Fabricius, or both, who in great haste had so happily painted it forth, or directed the hand of him that afterward did so happily paint and form it. From which we may observe how industrious and diligent he was in observing every thing.\n\nBut going to Venice about the end of August, he discovered his longing desire and designe of going to Rome; for though the Porta-sancta were not to be opened, nor the Jubilee celebra∣ted till the beginning of the following yeer: yet he was of opinion, that if he should wait there some moneths beforehand, he should not lose his time. He had been informed that shortly the fa∣mous marriage of the most Christian King with Maria Medicea, who is now the Queen-mother, was to be celebrated at Florence; and he would not for any thing, but be present at the Solemnity to behold the same. Wherefore after he had written to Padua, and particularly to Pinellus, sending him certain Inscriptions and other things, and withall intreating him to write by him to his friends at Rome: he departed in the\n\nbeginning of September, hiring a Bark to Ferra∣ria, or at least as far as to Francolin. But he came not to Florence till the twentieth day of the moneth, because what ever he met with wor∣thy the sight, he stayed so long as to take a per∣fect view thereof. But he made his longest stay at Bonnonia, because Julius Caesar Velius, who was reputed a most exquisite Antiquary, being much taken with his sweet converse, would needs hold him the longer to enjoy his company. Nor could that good old man forbear to write most cunning Letters touching his happinesse in the acquaint∣ance of Fabricius, which were full of wonderfull commendations. Pinellus, I am sure, cals them most cunning Letters, commending Fabricius that he was none of those, who in their travels do nothing but post from place to place, and therefore according to that of Seneca, are wont to have many hosts, but few friends.\n\nComing to Florence, he received Letters from his parents, and among some recommendatory Epistles, he found one from Charles of Lorram the Duke of Guise and Lieutenant of Provence, to Nicolas Brularrus Sillerius, who was afterward Chancellour of the Kingdom, and at present the Kings Embassadour at Rome, being come thi∣ther to celebrate the marriage. He therefore de∣sired to have Peireskius and his brother in his fa∣mily, that by his countenance they might have a more free admittance to see every thing. But be∣sides the Solemnity, he was chiefly delighted to see those brave Libraries, where he took notice of, and that I may so speak, almost adored the mo∣numents both of great princes and of learned men, by whom good letters began to be restored\n\nto the world. I shall not speak in particular of the Pandects, which though they were most cha∣rily kept up in the palace of the great Duke, yet he found means to see them, being well assured, that the learned world could not produce a more illustrious monument of Antiquity than they were. Also he made himself friends there, but none, as I remember, more constant than Richard Richards, a Student in the knowledge of plants and marbles, who conducted him up and down to shew him the publike edifices and gardens. After a moneth he went to Sena where his great∣est care was to salute Celsus Cittadinus, who was then writing a book, touching the originall and progresse of the Latine and Italian tongues. Fi∣nally, departing thence, he came to Rome about the end of October.\n\nNow it is not to be expressed, how soon he be∣came famously known at Rome; not onely be∣cause the letters of Pinellus and others, had al∣ready made his name renowned; but, also princi∣pally, because as soon as he began to frequent the company of the learned men there, he made them exceedingly both to admire and love him. It were long to recount the excellent Personages, whom he there honoured as friends, by all which, for his sparkling wit and most temperate man∣ners, he was highly respected: but because I can∣not passe them all over in silence, they that de∣serve in the first place to be mentioned, are those two great Cardinals, Baronius and Bellarmin. The former of which was astonished, when he heard him discourse in his presence, touching the Inscri∣ptions inserted in his Annals, and other abstruse points of History. And what may we suppose he\n\nthought, when he shewed him certain precious stones, and divers pieces of coin, upon which the Basilidians, Valentinians, & other hereticks, were wont to write certain barbarous words, there∣by to conceal their opinions? For he had collect∣ed many of these, to illustrate what he had inserted into his second Tome from the Amethyst of Ful∣vius Ursinus, touching the word A B P A Ξ A Ω, or A B P C Ξ, by which the Basilidians did signifie the most high God, containing seven Angels, which governed the seven Heavens; as also their 365 Virtues, equall in number to the dayes of the yeer; and this by reason of the seven letters, and their value in numeration (adding together the numbers, according to the place of each letter in the Alphabet) and such like considerations, which he likewise afterward explaned in certain Letters to Natalitius Benedictus. But Bellarmin hearing the same things, with other matters touching he∣resies and all ancient history, was at a stand which he should commend most, whether his sagacity in searching out, his sharpnesse in conjecturing, his judgement in choosing, his memory in rela∣ting, or his pleasant and delightfull manner of expressing himself. But he was justly enamoured with his meek and gentle manners: for to omit other instances, when he preached in a familiar way to instruct his Parishioners, he had him for his Auditour, sitting for the most part in the mid∣dest of the common people.\n\nThe next to be mentioned is Jacobus Sirmondus a Jesuite, even at that time of great repute; for with him he contracted a most intimate frendship, with whom he did communicate all his studies. The next is Laelius Pasohalinus, who had a most\n\ngoodly Closet of Rarities, and who so admi∣red his Learning and loved his Disposition, so that he had it once in his mind, and was resolved to give him what ever he had that was rare, to carry away with him: After him comes that same most renowned Fulvins Ursinus, a name of all others most known and framed among the Lovers of Antiquities, who by reason of certain Inter∣pretations, which Pincllus had wrote unto him, had a burning desire to be acquainted with Pei∣reskius, The next is Philippus Pigafetta, to whom whereas Pinellus had not at first written, tis wonderfull with what Commendations he did expiate that forgetfulnesse. After him, comes the self same Ghibertus with whom he been al∣ready acquainted at Avenion, who went abroad with him and shewed him divers things. The next was Paulus Gauldus a Learned Gentleman of Virentia, who also led him to many places, and having wondered at him when he saw him in the House Pinellus, he was now astonished at him in Rome. Also Petrus Stephanonus, Dionysius Octavius Sada, must be remembered, and gene∣rally all the Learned men which were in the City, with all the Lovers of good Arts and Let∣ters. But we must not forget Arnaldus Cardina∣lis Ossatus at that time the Kings Argent at Rome, a man singularly remarkable for Learn∣ing, Prudence, Integrity and sweetnesse of man∣ners: who could scarse ever be fatisfied with the Company of Peireskius, and when he came to visit him, he could never dismisse him without Regret. Nor must we forget Abbas Moutanus, Uncle to the Archbishops of Arles, who, moved more by the Commendation of the Virtues of\n\nPeireskius, then that of his Nephew the Arch∣bishop, would have him to be in a manner his perpetuall Guest.\n\nIt is hard now to express with what eagernesse of minde he sought out diligently all the monu∣ments of Antiquity. For in the First place he desired to know the situation of Rome, and the Grounds which it had contanied. When he saw the tops of the mountaines so low which he had imagined so high, he wondered at it. He was amazed among the rest to see the Hill Pala∣tinus so quite desolate, which was anciently as populous as any. He enquired if by any meanes he might come to know the utmost bounds of the Pomaerium both in the times of the Kings and un∣der the Emperors: and as he diligently marked all the gates and waies, so did he most diligently ex∣amine the Aurelian, because of the reliques thereof, which are yet to be seen in Provence. Then passing through the Quarters and Streets, he would fain know, as much as might be, where stood the Temples of the Ancients, their Chap∣pels, Altars, Groves, Sepulchers, Sanctuaries, Schooles, Libraries, Amphitheaters, Theaters, Wrastling-places, Horse-race-places, Places to represent Seafights, Fields, Musick-Rooms, Markets, Faires, Granaries, Armories, Baths, Hotbaths, Waters, Bridges, Colossuses, Spires, Columns, Statues and a thousand other things which in his reading of Authors he had observed, and noted into Books which he carried about with him. And he could hardly be satisfied with beholding, when he found any ancient piece remaining, whether it were whole or mangled.\n\nIn this manner he spent many daies about the Pantheon, a rare peice of Architecture, in consi∣dering the same & conferring therewith, all that Ludovicus Demontisius had reasoned touching the same. Also, because he knew there were kept in the Vatican a statue of Hercules, and Lao∣coon with his two Sons, most exquisite pieces, and esteemed by Michael Angelus for wonders of Art; therefore he went more then once to view them. Also he went divers times to see the two statues of Alxander and Bucephalus, which are yet extant as monuments of the fa∣mous Carver Phidias and Praxiteles. So, he went divers times to see the Sepulcher of C. Sestius Epulo, in the way which is termed Ostiensis, be∣cause of the most ancient and noble Reliques thereof, yet abiding. So he divers times view∣ed sundry Obelisques or Spires, but none often∣er, then that of Constantine; for the digging up, Transportation and erection thereof, he could not sufficiently praise the generous designe of Pope Sixtus the fift. So also the pillars, but especially one of Traian and another of Antoni∣nus. The former that he might satissie Pinellus, who was not contented with an whole volumne thereof (that is of the Historie of the two Dacian Wars, waged by Traianus, according as Alphon∣sus Ciaconus had gathered it out of the Columne) written: and therefore he desired Peireskius both to get him a more perfect Coppy of that Book; and that he would compare those pictures of Persons, Armes and Gestures which were in the Book with what was to be seen upon the Columne it self. The latter, that is the the Columne of Antoninus, that he might cause\n\nthe Picture of Jupiter raining gently upon the Army of the Romans, and throwing thunder∣bolts upon the Head; of their Enemies, to be diligently drawn therefrom. And indeed when afterwards he presented a draught thereof to Scaliger, to illustrate what Eusebius had written of a War between Antoninus and the Germans and Hungarians in the first year of the 138. Olym∣piade: This, said he, is one of the most notable things and best worthy to be seen, among all the Monuments of Antiquitie, which it was my good hap to see at Rome.\n\nNor was he only desirous to have the pictures of these things; but also of all other rare Statues, which he sought out in the Capitoll, in the Vati∣can, in the Farnesian and Caesian Houses; also in the Gardens and Vineyards, and, to be brief, in all private and publick places; taking pain∣ters with him, for to draw not only Statues and other works which were entire; but also broken Statues and the Ruines of ancient Buildings, where ever he met with any. Also he was wont to carry along with him certain choise Coines, which he would compare wth the statues, searching out the Age of every one, and for the most part discerning the hand of the Workman: for his Acutenes was such, that he could discern in a moment, what was truely ancient, and what only by imitation. Also he would have Copies of all Inscriptions savouring of Antiquity, endeavouring by his Sagacitie to supply such words or Letters as were eaten out, and to re∣store such as were in a manner desperate. More∣over he perused as much as he could, though not so much as he desired, such Manuscripts as were\n\npreserved in the Vatican Farnesian or other Li∣braries, and such as seemed to him most rare, he noted in his Table-book In like manner he noted down the Vessels, Pfctures, Images, and what ever he met with worthy of observation in sundry Conservatories of Metals, Conservatories of Images, Sore-houses, Studies, Walks, and Galle∣ries: to passe over an innumerable Company of things which either he bought with his mony, or by exchange, or had given him; and of which he ob∣tained at least the Patternes, the Figures in moles, the Seals or Stamps. One thing grieved him, viz. that he could neither obtain nor any where so much as see the Coines of Tullius Hostilius and Servius Tullius mentioned by Goltzius; nor yet those other Coines, mentioned with these Inscriptions Col. Aquae-Sextiae. Col. Arc∣late. Col. Avenio. Col. Arausio-Secundanorum, and such like; which in love to his Country, he most earnestly sought for, but in vain.\n\nBy this meanes, he caused himself to be excee∣dingly admired, not only at Rome, where all Learned Men were ambitious of his friendship, but in sar remore places, whithersoever the same of him did spread it self. And at this time it was, that his great acquaintance began with Natalitius Benedictus, a man most amply furnished, with most exquisite Rarities, who dwelt then at Ful∣linium; and with Adolphus Occo a Physitian of Augsburge, who was then setting out the second time a Book of the Coines of the Roman Emperors: not to speake of those he knew be∣fore, as Hieronymus Rubens at Ravenna, Caesar Nichezola at Verona, Antonius Tolentinus at Cremona, Caesar Camnanus at Vicentia, and many\n\nin other places. But it is wonderfull how fa∣mous he grew, at Padua especially, as the Letters sent him about that time by Laurentius Pigno∣rius do testifie; who, though himself so skilled in Antiquities, did yet professe that he Learned more out of one of his Letters, then out of ten Volumes of Antiquaries. And who admired not only the abundance of the things which he collected, but the rare choice that he made, when as, of two peices, of Constantines Coine which were sent him, he said he knew them as men are wont to know the Lion by his claw. The like Expressions were written by Emundus Brutius, Georgius Ragusaeus, Jacobus Papifavius, Martinus Sandellus, and whom I ought to have named first, Marcus Cornarus the most worthy Major of the City, with whom he after∣wards exercised friendship by Letters as long as he lived. But in what esteem he was at Padua this one thing does testifie, that whereas the Print of a Sapphire being sent thither from Augs∣burge, with an Inscription in which the word Xiphiae did puzzle all the curious Antiquaries; Pinellus writ unto him referring unto him the Examination and Judgment thereof. I omit how he satisfied their Doubts, and gave Light to that word, cheifly from Strabo, who from Polybius makes mention of the hunting of the Xiphia, which was a Sea-monster.\n\nAs for what concerns the state of new Rome, there was no Temple College, nor Hospital, which he went not into: no magnificent Palace, no famous worke of any of the Popes, which he visited not: no Picture of Raphael Urbin, Mi∣chael Angelo, Polydorus Caraevagius, Titianus,\n\nor any other famous Painrer, which he viewed not. Likewise the Burning places, and secret Caves under the ground, places full of Venera∣tion and Monuments of Christian Pietie and Constancie. Also he was present at the Perfor∣mance of Religious Ceremonies, as much as he thought he might with safety. For, being but or a weakly complexion, he was loath to thrust himself into a tumultuous Crowd of People. And therefore, as concerning the usuall solem∣nities of the Jubilee, he saw and observed them as far as he was able; but he committed the Care of seeing all close at hand, to his Brother Valavasius, as being the stronger of the two, from whom he was to receive the Relation of all. The same he did with Reverence to the Ceremonies (as they are called) of the Lords Supper: about which time, both he and his Brother, that they might see the Pope, waiting upon those poor Men whom he daily feeds, and sitting with them at Table in the same Hall; they bought the turnes of Two poor men, and putting on their Cloathes, they were present among the rest, and though the Pope knew who they were, yet he pleasantly dissembling his knowledge, and taking no notice of them, they saw all.\n\nThe feast of Easter, being over at Rome, and after he had distributed divers tokens which he received from home, and also had sent some to Pi∣nellus, he journeyed to Naples. It were super∣fluous to reckon up, how far and how often he went out of his way, to enquire after divers places both in Latium and Campania, celebra∣ted by Authors. Then he was, he said, most affected, when he saw and diligently viewed\n\nthose places recorded by Virgil, as Cajeta, Cu∣ma, and their Reliques; Mons Misenus the Avernian Lake, and such like. As also the Places where they say Cicero and Lucullus had their Country Houses; or where Sciplo Africa∣nus and Virgil were buried: and such other mat∣ters relating to great Personages. He said more∣over, that when he entered into that Cave, or, as Seneca calls it, that long and dark Prison, viz. the Mountain Pausilippus, which was dug a mile throrough, which he past and repast; it grieved him that the Man who had attempted so rare an Action, so much for the accommo∣dation of Travellers and shortening of their Journey, was either altogether unknown, or not certainly known at most. For he judged that he was more worthy of Commendation then Xerxes, who warring against Greece, did not only separate the Mount Athos from the Continent, but also dug a way thorough the midst of it.\n\nAs soon as ever he came to Naples, he could not contain himself, but he must visit the two Porta's, those famons Bretheren. Now after he was brought in to the elder Brother, whose name was Johannes Vincentius, he was so taken after a little discourse, that crying out as a man in admiration, he led him in to his younger Brother Johannes Baptista, that he likewise might be strucken with the like Admiration. And Peiresk••us was wont to relate, that though Johan∣nes Faptista was already well in years, and venera∣ble for his hoary haires; yet that he was wont with such Reverence to observe the Commands and be at the Beck of John Vincent his Bro∣ther,\n\nthat he could not give more respect to the presence and commands of his Father. And as he of his own accord gave them many things, so did he receive the like from them again: nor did he only see what ever they kept in their stu∣dies, and precious treasuries, but he was pre∣sent at their Experiments of all kinds almost, intimating to them his earnest desires that way. Hence it was that he grew exceeding familiar with both of them; and they afterward main∣tained mutuall friendship by divers Letters which past between them, and sundry kindnesse; they did one for another. He visited moreover the studie of Ferrans Ineperatus, which was likewise very well furnished with Ratities of nature: also that of Adrian Williams, Mars Gurgushlola, and of Mathaeus Capuanus Princeof the Con∣chans although he was fain to go out of the Citty to him. Moreover he diligently sought out of all Monument; of Antiquity; and certain Columnes, above the rest, he would needs have drawn out, being of Corinthian work; also Apol∣lo with his Tripes, and some such live Figures. Also he enquired and learnt as much as he could possible, touching such Families as had been translated from Naples to Provence, and of such Provencian Families as had been translated from thence to Naples. And knowing that in the Church dedicated to Saint Clare there were ma∣ny Sepulchers of Kings and Princes of the Royall blood of kin to Charles the First, who (as we said before) was Brother to St. Lewis King of France: therefore he viewed them very lilizent∣ly, drew out the chief of them, and writ out the Epitaphs. Moreover he carefully enquired af∣ter\n\nthe Sepulcher of Simon Portius a famous Philosopher not long since deceased: for indeed Pinellus had desired him to enquire if there were any Sepulcher of his to be seen, especially with an Inscription.\n\nThere dwelt then at Naples a certain Woman which was famous for her holinesse and the course of life which she led. Shee being called to Rome in the dayes of Pope Gregory the thirteenth, and examined and approved of by the good Bellarmin, was said to be rapt into an extasie, as soon as she received the Eucharist, so that just in the posture wherein she received it, upon her knees, so she remained, immoveable and stiffe as a stake, her eyes being open and she not seeing, nor feeling at all over her whole body. And therefore Pei∣resk••us would not leave that City, before he had seen and tryed so wonderfull a matter. And in∣deed he could not obtain his desire without much ado; but he, as one that could breake thorough all that stood in his way, obtained his will at last, and carried with him Johannes Porcelletus Malliancus, who was afterwards Bishop of Toul. He saw her therefore and tried her, and when he related it, he was wont to admire whether any such thing could happen by the Art of Man; nor was he easie to believe Cardan, who reports that he could cast himself into such a kind of ex∣tasie, as often as he pleased.\n\nAfter he had sufficiently viewed the Cirty and admired the Elegancie and Pleasantnesse thereof, he desired nothing more, then that he might go to the mount Vesuvius and contemplate that place, where the great Pliny died. That being accomplished, he was exceedingly desi∣rous\n\nto see Sicilia, and to passe as far as to Malta. Now there were three things which he chiefly desired to see, the Straights of Scylla, the Burn∣ing of Aetna, and the Antiquities of Syracuse: but Fonvivius would not consent, nor would he ever go to any place without his Tutors consent. Wherefore it sufficed him to go round about all that Country, and likewise to return again to certain places, as towards the Puteoli and Baiae, that he might see with his eyes two buildings under ground, which were termed, Piscina mi∣rabilis and Labyrinthus, that is, the wonderfull Fishpond and the Labyrnith, And I know not whether I should add, how when he consider∣ed the shoar near the Puetoli and towards Baiae, and asked to see that kind of dust which would in the Sea-water turn to stone; how there was likewise discovered unto him, among the Sands a certain lead-coloured dust, wherewith Sculp∣tures, especially such as are made on the Onyx stone may be preserved. And whereas, on that shoare Coines were sound almost eaten asunder, he conceived the cause thereof to be sulphur, which is thought not discernable, by sense, in all those Coasts; a blackish Vapour arising withall from the Sea, with a corrosive facultie in it.\n\nA month after he went again to Rome, that he might take leave of his friends, bestowing divers gifts amongst them, and sending some to other parts. For he had resolved with himself to return to Padua before the Solstice and great heat should come; and therefore after a few daies he left Rome mourning for his Absence. He bent his. course to Perusia, both for the Universities sake and that he might\n\nbehold the Lake of Thrasumen. From thence he turned ande to Eugubium, by reason of a Brasen Table which was lately there sound, with an In cription upon it in the Old Hetruscan Lan∣guage. Then having at Assisium saluted the Monument of St. Francis, he visited Natalitius Benedictus at Fullinium, who most earnestly ex∣pected him. Then he saw at the Mount Falco among the Reliques of St. Clare, three remarke∣able found Balls which had heen found in her Gall-bladder being of an exceecing light sub∣stance. Then having done his devotions at the so famous Chappell of our Lady of Loretto, he went to Ancona, and from thence to Urbin, that he might get a Licence to peruse the Dukes Libraries: departing thence to Pisaurum and Ariminum, he came to Ravenna, where Hi∣eronymus Rubens that same famous Physitian and scearcher out of the Antiquities of his Coun∣try, longed to embrace him, and to shew him, in the very seat of the secret treasury, I know not what Reliques of Gothish Barbarisme, and the Ornaments of the Emperors and contempora∣ry Kings, with these names; ATHALA∣RICUS RIX, WITIGES RIX, THE∣OD OHA TUS and such like; Also to shew him certain Ornaments of Gallia placidia in I know not what Church, which Vellius con∣ceived were not ancient: finally that he might give him with his own hand a Coppy of the Histo∣ry of Ravenna. From thence he came to Ve∣nice, where having saluted his friends to their great Contentment, he was desirous to be tho∣roughly acquainted with Axtonlus Possevinus an excellent Man of the society of Jesus, to whom\n\nwhen he desired Letters commendatory, Sir∣mondus writ Back unto him in these words. Why do you seek a Broker, seeing you are able to make your self known, and beloved, of all you shall come to? Finally not many daies after, that is to say about the middle of June, he came to Padua, where he was received with so much joy, that a Man would have thought, that some god of Students was come to Town. But his return did most of all rejoyce the good Pinellus, who sound himself drawing towards death, by reason of certain Lingring Diseases which had a long time troubled him, and which were now grown worse then formerly. A day could not suffice to hear what he had sound; not to look upon what he had brought away; nor to understand the Interpretations which he made, of such things as seemed obscure. I know not whether I should do well to relate, how Peireskius, being wont to boast among his Acquaintance of the happiness he had in making Baronius and Bellar∣min his friends, the good Pinellus was thereby moved to relate what had happened to him∣self touching those two Cardinals? When (quoth he) the Popethree years ago came to Ferrara, they vouchsafed to visit me, but con∣cealing their names, and in a disguised habit, say∣ing that they were only a Couple of Priests. I, by their Pictures which I had, knew presently who they were: but making as if I knew them not, I brought them into that part of my study where the Pictures of famous men hung, and theirs amongst the rest. And shewing to Baronius the Picture of Bellarmine, Honest friend (quo th I) does not this Picture exceedingly\n\nresemble this companion of yours? And shew∣ing Bellarmin the picture of Baromus; Does not this also (quoth I) excellently resemble that com∣panion of yours? Whereupon perceiving that they thinking to deceive, were themselves deceived, they discovered themselves, and loving∣ly embraced me.\n\nFurthermore, Peireskius foreseeing that after a yeer was over, he should be sent for home again into his own countrey; therefore he set himself seriously to the study of Law, which he had inter∣mitted of late: yet so ordering his time, that he had leisure for many other things. For besides di∣vers kindnesses (of which hereafter) performed for learned men, he made continuall progresse in the knowledge of abstruse Histories and remotest Antiquities. Of which he gave a remarkable in∣stance, when a controversie arising among the cu∣rious, touching the mount Argaeus, he discour∣sed from a jasper, and divers pieces of money coi∣ned at Caesarea and other places, the originall and the various ceremonies, wherewith that mount was anciently adored in Cappadocia. Al∣so he continually studied such languages as he thought might be usefull to him. For he learnt so much of the Hebrew, both in the vulgar and Samaritan character, and of the Syrian Dialect, and the Arabian Idiom, as he thought necessary to interpret the inscriptions of shekels, and other such like pieces, being instructed by a certain Jew dwelling at Padua, whose name was Rabbi Solo∣mon. As for the Greek tongue, he took more pains in the study thereof, both because of the di∣vers Institutions of the Greek Emperours, and the Originall of the Law it self, which is reckoned to\n\nbe from Greek fountains; as also for the study of Philosophy or wisdome, and the most ancient monuments of Poetry and History, which remain in that language; also for the explication of jew∣els, marbles, and coins, whose inscriptions are in Greek, in the illustration whereof, it seemed to him a goodly thing and full of delight to spend his serious endeavours. And therefore, when he wrote unto any man that was a Lover of Greek, as for example to Occo (who was alwayes accu∣stomed to strew his Epistles with Greek senten∣ces) he also was wont to testifie his learning in that kinde, sometimes by putting a Greek verse in the front of his Letters, otherwile interwea∣ving some Greek sentence, verse or prose, in some convenient place of his Letters; as to the foresaid Adolphus Occo, when he wrote thus, Fortunate senex te divae illius antiquae & venerandae, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 filiae, non jam 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, sed 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 duplici nomine Germanum dicent. shat is, Happy old man now will the daughters of that aneient and venerable Goddesse Mnemosyne call thee no longer Adolphos, but Adelphos [that is, Brother] or, frater Germa∣nus, in a twofold respect.\n\nNor was he onely studious of Humanity, but he took great pains also in the Mathematicks, be∣ing from this time forward dearly beloved of Galileus, whom he first grew acquainted with at the house of Pinellus, and much admired him for the engin he invented to drain out the waters, which then infested the city. Also he was very industrious to search out the causes of wonderfull things in Nature. For he both divers times asked divers Philosophers, touching those three. Suns and threefold Rainbowes which were seen the\n\nseventh day of February, about the 21 hour of the day. Also intending to Philosophize, touching fishes and other things turned into stone, he both procured great store of them, and placed them in a corner of his study, and likewise obtained a platform or description of that mount, which at Vincentium abounds with such things. And what any man knew touching things digged out of the earth, minerals and metals, either by re∣wards, or by gentle intreaties he gained the com∣munication thereof; but especially at Venice, where, as he said, he saw and observed many rari∣ties in the Arsenall or Armoury there; yet was there nothing, which he more delighted to be∣hold, than the forming of Alum into an octahe∣dricall figure, so as to make a body that had eight sides. Also he frequently visited the rarer sort of gardens, to search out the severall siens and ver∣tues both of homebred and sorrain plants, in∣tending to send some of them into Provence, and others likewise from Provence, sometimes to the garden of Pinellus, otherwhiles to other friends. And he was wont to be present, not onely at the publike dissections of the Anatomists, but also at the private ones of Hieronymus Fabricius ab A∣qua Pendente; who out of the singular good will he bare to Peireskius, did admit him to be present; when of a parcell of eggs upon which an Hen did sit, he took out every day one, that he might thereby make observation of the formation of the Chick, all along from the very beginning to theend. And so much as touching his studies.\n\nIt sollows that we now shew, how from this time forward learned and studious men did ac∣knowledge that Peireskius had taken the helm of\n\nlearning in his hand, and began to guide the Common-wealth of Letters. I mentioned be∣fore, how that when he came from Rome, the most excellent Pinellus began to be worse than ordinary in point of sicknesse, and to tend towards the grave. He therefore, not long after, viz. a∣bout the beginning of August departed this world, neer seventy yeers old: to the great grief truly of all good and learned men; but of Peireskius more especially, who accounted him as another father, and did reverence him accordingly. But though he left the whole learned world sensible of its losse, occasioned by his death; yet was it a com∣fort that he seemed to have delivered his Lampe to Peireskius, leaving him the successour of his virtues and studies. For he had so moulded him∣self according to the manners of Pinellus; he be∣came so animated with the studie of noble and brave things, and advancing of good Arts, that he might justly be thought to have inherited his he∣roicall virtues. For the clearer evincement whereof, I shall collect some testimonies to witnesse the truth of what is suggested in this par∣ticular.\n\nAnd in the first place I shall cire the famous Paulus Gualdus, who wrote the life of Pinellus, and of whom mention was lately made. He, af∣ter he had lamented the death of that worthy man, and said, That Nature was sparing in her production of such personages, and that they had need to live Met huselahs age, who should look for another Pinellus, viz. such an one, whose stu∣dy might restore the studies of Humanity to their splendour, whose riches might be laid out in col∣lecting the most renowned books; and whose\n\nDignity might be a Patronage to learned Men; at last he adds. Verily, if our Age shall produce such another, sure I am it cannot be any save Ni∣colas Fabricius a French-man of Aix in Provence, a most renowned young Gentleman, who at Rome and Padua, when he was but a youth in compari∣son, did so earnesty and eagerly embrace Pinellus and his studies, that he seemed to us, and all learn∣ed men delighted with these studies, a very Miracle.\n\nThis was indeed an excellent Prediction: But let us consider likewise the Wish of Erycius Pu∣teanus, then (as we said before) Professor of Eloquence and Chronologie at Millain. He writing to Peireskius, O the wound (quoth he) Which we have received by the death of Pinellus! That never to be forgotten man is gone away, satis∣fied with honour and renown, and secure of his own fame: But he hath left us in Griefe and want and the muses in mourning weeds. Who shall stand up in his stead and take sorrow from us and Sack-cloath from the muses? Not only Learn∣ing but Wealth also is requisite for such a work. Who will be the Man? Does mymind deceive me? or are you the man called to this work to be what Pinellus was? I wish it, I vow it; and so God save thee thou hopefull young man. And here per∣adventure it will not be unpleasing to insert the answer of Peireskius; which was in these words, You tear my soul in pieces with grief while you rip up that wound which is made in my mind by the Death of that incomparable man. 'Tis not without cause you double your mournfull and sorrowfull words; you justly bewaile our hard hap; and cause enough you have, while you invite us all to mourn, and exclaime, Who will take grief from us and Sackcloath from the\n\nMuses? But in the Conclusion you make us laugh, when, as if you would prophesie, you, add that I shall be what Pinellus was; and seriously wish the same, as if it were a thing possible. Which is all one: as if when an huge Fir-Tree is Cutt down, you should wish that some low shrub, might aequal the Strength & Tallnesse thereof. But your love to me forced this vow and wish from you, when you were thinking of some other thing, for which I suppose you never ima∣gined you should he called in question. And in case, I wishing and vowing the same thing to you, should say with the Poet TUNUNC ERIS ALTER AB ILLO, THOU SHALT TO HIM SUCCEED, these, I am sure, who thoroughly know you, will say, that I am no vain Prophet; for in this case there is need of your help and not of mine. A witty and neat answer verily; how beit he takes no notice of that which was most truly said by Putean, that to undergo such a ask there was also need of Wealth as well as Learning.\n\nThere were likewise other very elegant Let∣ters which passed betwixt them, one of which is printed in the second Century of the Epistles of Putean, wherein about the beginning of the next year which was 1602. he, after a most be∣coming way, complaines, that he was termed Deorum Genus one of the immortall Race of the Deities. There were, I say, other Letters written: but I have collected what is usefull to my present purpose, by which it is easy to undentand, how fitly Janus Gruterus in the Preface to his great Volume of Inscriptions, did joyne together by way of Commendation Erycius Puteanus and N'colaus Fabricius, calling them, Young men who excell all others.\n\nWhouse to haunt the Muses sacred Springs, And drink dry Aganippes Waterings.\n\nMoreover, that great Volumne was in the Presse, when Pinellus departed this life: and Peireskius supplied such things as were to be inserted thereinto, not only out of the Trea∣suries of Pinellus; but also from what he had observed and written-out at Rome, Venice, and other Places: as appears by that which is so fre∣quently read at the bottome of the Inscriptions, Ont of the Papers of Nicolaus Fabricius.\n\nI come now to Marcus Velserus, at whose request Gruterus obtained those Papers. He was almost equall to Pinellus, and his singular friend, flourishing at Augsburg, where he was one of the two that Governed the City. Though I hold my tongue, his own writings, and all Learned men having had experience of his mu∣nificent and most ready Assistance, do sufficient∣ly speake, how brave a man he was, and how great a soule he had. Velserus therefore, in Letters which he wrote to Peireskius, did testifie that he so highly valued him and his friendship, that there was nothing that Pinellus lest behind him, which he had rather inherit: yea and he also not only acknowledging him to be the heir of the Virtues of Pinellus, but conjecturing that he should be likewise the successor of his own, he began to love him as if he had been his Son. not ceasing so long as he lived, by frequency of Letters to restifie his affection. In this one thing he dealt hardly with him, constantly re∣fusing to let him have his Picture, which Re∣solution he held towards all others, that most\n\npassionately desired the same. Yet Peireskius caused him, as he had done some others, to be drawn when he knew not of it, hiring a Pain∣ter to stand in a secret place, where he might see his Countenance. And so he obtained what Occotold him it was in vain to hope for, when he received this answer from Velserus, Cato ma∣jor was desirous that Posterity should enquire, why no Statue had been erected for him: contrarily, it lies me in hand, I suppose to take heed, least any hereafter should, wonder if not disdaine and ask, what Ambition it was, that made me creep into the Soci∣ety of those famous men, whose Images or Pictures, Fabricius pretends to Collect. I forbear to tell how excellently our Peireskius ansvvered that passage of his: for, writing back to Occo, Cato (quoth he) said both wittily and discreetly, that he had rather posterity should enquire why he had no Statue, then why a statue was erected in Memorie of him; yet he never, that I ever read of, refused to suffer himself to be painted or figured out in a Statue; witnesse those many Figures of him, which go up and down even at this day. And therefore neither ought Velserus, the true Picture of Cato, to refuse the same; to which end I pray you entreat him, that he may not refuse, and give not ever (I again beseech you) untill you have perswaded him.\n\nAfter Velserus, Josephus Justus Scaliger must follow, that renowned Person, more famously known then, to need my Commendation. He (I say) must follow to make it appear how freely and cheerfully Peireskius devoted himself to him and other Learned Men. For he, truly, exceedingly applauded his own good fortune,\n\nthat such a friend had succeeded into the Place of Pinellus. That you may understand the occasion, it was thus. Scaliger had writ to Pi∣nellus, to procure him, certain Hebrew Books, also certain Coines of the Scaligers that had been Princes; and sent with all certain things of his own and fathers wriring, which they had writ∣ten with their own individuall hands; also both their Pictures, as he had desired him. Carolus Clusius wrote at the same time, and sent one of his Books of the History of rare Plants, and the Picture of Lobelius which was desired: not to speake of the Letters which Scaliger sent to Ca∣rolus Leberoneus Bishop of Valence, who dwelt then at Padua. They came to Padua when not only Pinellus was dead, but Caesar also the Duke of Atheruntium was gone out of the City, who was Pinellus his Brothers Son. And because he had left Order with Gualdus, that if any Let∣ters came to his Uncle, he should receive them & send them to him to Naples; therefore Gualdus received all, and before he sent them, did make Peireskius therewith acquainted. Whereupon Peireskius set pen to paper and wrote back to Scaliger, acquainting him with the death both of Pinellus and the Bishop, and assuring him that what he had sent would be thankfully ac∣cepted by the soresaid Caesar: he took upon himself the Care of procuring those Hebrew Books, and Coines, which he had desired Pinel∣lus to get for him: promising that he would at least by the first opportunity send him some which he had already, offering also to commu∣nicate some other things in his Custody, tending to the Illustration of the familie of Scaligers,\n\nwhich because he had in Veneration, he added, that he could not let those Pictures of him and his Father go, before he had procured Copies of them. He wrote, in like manner, to Clusius; and it cannot be expressed, how much they pro∣fessed themselves obliged to so generous a dispo∣sition and such singular Humanity. Which oc∣casioned this speech of Scaliger in a Letter to Velserus, which is inserted into the third Book, in which, I received (quoth he) those Coines of the Familie of Scaligers together with yours and our friend Fabricius his Letters; for which I give you thanks. I have not yet received those Hebrew Books, which he sent me out of Italie; because they are among the goods of Raphelengius, which are not yet arrived. As soon as I shall receive them, I will both write to him, to give him thankes, and you shall be sure to hear again from me. Now this Letter was written, on the fourth of the Ides of May.\n\nAnd to acquaint you with some others to whom he cheerfully lent his assistance: In the first place, what ever Pinellus had taken in hand in favour of Learned men, he endeavoured with all his might, to accomplish and bring the same to perfection. For he left no stone unturned, nothing unessaied that he might effect what Pi∣nellus had promised to Prosper Alpinus a very famous Physitian, about the gayning of a Trea∣tife touching a third Sect of Methodicall Physiti∣ans. And whereas we should speake of those, whom after the example of Pinellus he assisted, one may serve instead of all, viz. the foresaid Pignorius; who interpreting the Table, of Isis (that is to say a famous Brazen table, full\n\nof Aegyptiun Hieroglyphicks, which being a Re∣lick of Petrus Bembus the Cardinall, was at that time kept as a rarity, in the Library of the Duke of Mantua,) gives thankes in the first place to Velserus, but then adds, and to Nicolas Fra∣bricius Lord of Chalasium, a young Gentleman most illustrious by the Splendor of his family and and his own profound Learning; who has not only bountifully communicated, most rare reliques of Antiquitie (wherewith he is most richly furnished) for the use of my self and other students; but has been very careful that we might have the use of the Rarities of othermen. By his Industrie it is, that not only at Venice, I have upon all occasious had accesse to the rare Coines, and prccious stones of the most il∣lustrious Fridericus Contarenus, Procurator of St. Marke; and of Johannes Mocenicus: but also at Rome, I was admitted to the rich Treasurie of that gallant man, Laelius Pascalinus, out of which I was furnished with Coines, Gemms, Seales; all rare. From the said Fabricius, I must acknowledge to have received all, which I publish to the world, out of the precious Treasuries of Natalitius Bene∣dictus, from which these Augmentations of ours have received both strength and spirit. For, all which we have produced, to Illustrate the Histo∣ry of Epiphanius, Irenaeus, and the other Fathers, touching their cudgelling of the ancient Sectaries, came from thence. These things I have set down at large; because they confirme much of what has been said before.\n\nAnd I shall add, as touching Pignorius, how when he wrote his book of the Antiquities of Pa∣dua, Peireskius procured for him of Johannes Vin∣centius Porta, that which he afterward did com∣mit\n\nto writing, as also Philippus Tomasinus, touch∣ing an arm of Titus Livius, viz. how the Citizens of Padua took an arm from among the bones of Titus Livius (which they kept) and bestowed it upon that renowned Patron of learning, Alphou∣sus King of Arragon, he most earnestly, by Anto∣nius Panormita his Embassadour, desiring the same in the yeer of Christ, 1451. And when no body knew what was become of this arm, Peireskius took occasion to send certain tokens to Porta, as it were in recompence of the Effigies of a certain marble, wherein was expressed the ancient man∣ner of putting Souldiers sub jugum, under the yoke or Gallows; and withall, earnestly desired him to write him word, what he could, by his great sagacity, discover touching the said arm. Who returned him by way of answer, that nei∣ther King Alphonsus being prevented by death, nor yet Panormita, could accomplish the buriall of the said arm, according as they desired: but his successour, being Secretary of State, had pla∣ced it under a marble stone, without the Oratory, with this Inscription: Here lies the arm of Titus Livius the Historiographer, which was in times past procured by Antonius Panormita, and many yeers after, buried in this place, by Johannes Jovia∣nus Pontanus. Neverthelesse, this marble had not been seen for many yeers last past, by reason of a Chappell built thereupon, by a Covent of I know not what Friers.\n\nMoreover, as Peireskius was bountifull to∣wards Pignorius; so was he likewise to Ulysses Aldrovandus, that same famous writer of the History of all kind of living Creatures; who had of him many Coines, especially Asiatick towards\n\nthe Illustration, of what he had already publish∣ed touching the Symbolicall use of Living Crea∣tures, and was now again fitting for the Presse. And he writing from Bononia, did very gratefully promise, to make honourable mention, of him by whom he had been assisted: but being soon af∣ter taken blind, he could not perform what he had promised. Johannes Baptista Villalpandus promised the same thing, caresully enquiring after his Name, Country, and Condition, that he might acquaint the world, from whom he had received the Shekels, and many others things towards the amplification of his Treatise of He∣brew Mony, after those large Commentaries up∣on Ezechiel. Also, it falls here fit to tell, how Sirmondus, though he would receive of Peires∣kius at his departure from Rome, no Coines but such of which he had two at least of a sort; yet he desired and obtained of him, after he was come back to Padua, more then two hundred of Greek Coines alone. For he had collected at that time above a thousand of that kind, which had never been so much as mentioned by such as wrote of Coines: and having such as had been coined both before and after the Roman Empire, in all the chief Citties of Greece and Asia, of which he made up the Succession of the Princes of the Se∣lucidae, from Alexander to the Romans: for this cause, Sirmondus desired to know this succession, that after the Example thereof, he might set down and make a succession of the Princes of Aegypt. But we must not dwell too long upon these matters.\n\nTo proceed therefore having spent now almost three years in Italie, he began to make provision\n\nfor his return. And, he was, indeed, desirous to passe from Venice to Augsburge, both that he might there visit Verserus and Occo: as also that from thence he might, passing along the River Danow, view the bordering parts of Germany and Hungary, and passe at last through the Eux∣ine Sea and Thracian Bosphorus unto Constan∣tinople, intending afterwards to travell as much of the Grecian Territories as he could, But Fonvivius his Tutor was absolutely against that motion, either because he thought his Father and his Uncle would not approve of it, as being too long a digression and very full of hazard; or else because he himself was called back again to Paris. Peireskius therefore not in the least da∣ring to do any thing contrary to his Tutors mind, ordered his Businesse so, that in the first place he did by Letters take leave of all his friends in Ita∣lie, of whom he could not take leave in Person, and by the tender of his service, and tokens also for the most part added thereto, he obliged them unto him. So he did likewise by his Friends in other Countries, and especially Scaliger, to whom besides the things aforesaid, he sent cer∣tain Coines which he had newly received from his friends at Verona, and some other things ap∣pertaining to the Family of Scaligers. Then he collected all the rare Books, Gemmes and other exquisite things he could come by: thinking with himself, that he should not find such plenty in his own Country. Being ready to depart, he put them all, with his other baggage into certain Chests, which he directed to Genüa, from thence to be conveigh'd to Marscilles: he only reserved some things which were most rare and colly, to\n\ngo with himself, and fare as he fared. For, when he had viewed what he thought good in Liguria, he was defirous to passe through Gallia Cisalpina and so come to Lions, there to see how he might re∣ceive Letters from his friends, and to send to them again. Finally, leaving hehind him a great misse of himself, at Padua especially, and at Venice (not to speake of Augs-burge, where Vel∣serus failing of the exspectation he had to see him, mourned as if he had lost halfe his Soul) he be∣gan his journey.\n\nHe made his first stop at Vicentia to salure his friends there, and to see that Mountain, whose delineation he had desired; as we before hinted. Also he viewed at Gustosa that same conveigh∣ance of the wind by pipes and channells: also he heard and set down in his Table-Book, the History of him that brought the wind out of a place a good way off, through a passage under ground into his house, in such manner; that at last, he could cut, and distribute the same, this way and that way as he pleased himself. He came then to Verona, where his chief care was to look after the Sepulchers of the Scaligers; the Pictures whereof, because he could not then ob∣tain, he did afterward compasse them by the medi••tion of Caesar Nichezola and Marcus An∣tonius Montanus. When he was at Mantua, there he saw and noted down many things in the Dukes Chamber of Rarities, so that when some years since he understood, that it was plundred, when the Germans destroyed the City, he could scarce sufficiently comfort himself for many daies together; such a losse he e••eemed it. Among the rest, he curionsly viewed that same AEgyptian\n\nTable, that he might satisfie many scruples, of Pignorius thereabouts. Having seen Cremo∣na, he would needs step aside to Brixia and Bergamus, and come to Millain, where not only Putean and the two Septalii, and other friends; but especially that never to be enough praised Arch-bishop and Cardinall Fridericus Borromaeus, Founder of the Ambrosian Libra∣ry, which even then began to be frequented, did most courteously entertain him many daies to∣gether. From thence, departing through Tici∣num, Novaria and Versellis, he came to Tauri∣num, and thence over the Alpes to Geneva; were having run over many Bookes, and view∣ed the Lake Lemmanus, he went to a village called Tononom, that he might become an Eye∣witnesse of those wonderfull things which were then said to be performed by persons possessed with the Divell. Having passed over the Lake, and viewed the bordering parts of Switzer-Land, he was pleased to performe his devotions at the famous Church of St. Claudius, especially praying for the Health of his Uncle being of the same name. From thence he would have gone out of his way to Semurium, that he might salute that same David, who was sometimes his Master, and to see those Houses, in which Genebrardus died three years before: but the condition of affaires in Burgundy being altered and made dangerous, by the Faction of Marshall Biron did deterre him from that Purpose. He turned therefore aside to Lions rather, where receiving mony he bountifully remunerated his Tutor, who was (as we hinted before) to go to Paris.\n\nMoreover, though he loved his Country and Parents, yet he cunningly desired not to go di∣rectly home, but to depart to Mon-pellier, where Julius Pacius of Beriga, a Lawyer of Vi∣centium, was reported to professe Law with great Commendations. For because he had not satisfied himself in the study of the Lawes, and was resolved neither to require nor accept the Title of Doctor, without gaining singular honour in testification of his Learning; there∣fore he would not go home, least he should be compelled whether he would or no, to commence Doctor, and that he might first become more Learned under so famous a Professor. And therefore he went to Monpellier about the be∣ginning of July, and presently put himself and his Brother to board with Pacius. And he pre∣sently acquainted his Father and his Uncle with his Intentions, who never suspecting such a thing, were somewhat afraid, lest that he had not suffi∣ciently plied his Law-studies in Italie. For besides his going aside to Mon-pellier, they saw sufficiently, both by the Chests which they received from Ge∣nüa, and those remaining choiser Rarities, of which he disburthened himself at Mon-pellier, that he must needs bestow so much time in the Collection and knowledge of them, that there would remaine little or none, to study the Lawes.\n\nWhich when he came to understand he made a kind of Apologie, whereby to remove that sus∣picion, viz. That he had cut off none of the time which was due to his Law-Studies; but look what houres other young Men did bestow in Games and Plaies, in Compotations, or\n\nDalliance with women, that he spent in gain∣ing of Antiquity. And that Masse of Antiqui∣ties which they saw, was at least a token, that the money which he had been furnished with, was not consumed in naughty and Dissolute Liv∣ing. And that he likewise knew, that the study of antiquity was not unusefull towards the know∣ledge of the Lawes, seeing without that, most places of the Digests and the Codes could not be understood; and that they themselves might find so much by experience, seeing for example sake Interpreters knew not what to make of those Virtolas ex Smaragdis often mention'd by Ulpianus and Paulus which himself could understand, by meanes of some which he had got at Rome out of certain Ruines, and which he would send to them; A thing which had not been seen now for many Ages together. That there was like∣wise among his Baggage, many reliques of that kind of mony which the ancients termed Aes grave (because they were wont to weigh it) and among the many parts of the Roman As, there was a Quadrans, which upon the one side had the image of a Sow by meanes of which and other pieces stamped in like manner with a Bull and a Sheep, money was termed Pecunia a Pecudi∣bus, from Beasts marked upon it. Also they should find almost innumerable things besides, of which to hear him discourse in their presence, must needs be a matter of delight unto them both. Finally that both himself and his Brother had placed themselves with Pacius, not because they thought themselves lesse knowing in the Laws, then others of their years; but because they desired to know somewhat more excellent and beyond all others.\n\nThis defence which he made for himself did wonderfully please his Parents, and his Uncle especially, who was inflamed with so great a desire to see him, that ere three moneths were well over, he would needs send for him home. He came away therefore; and reached his Fathers House in the moneth of November: but he brought Pacius along with him, that so he might avoid being kept at home, if by no other meanes, yet at least under the pretence of accompanying Pacius back again. But his Brother was left behind, because being then newly recovered from sicknesse, he could not undertake the jour∣ney with safety. It is not my purpose in this place to recount, with what exultation Peires∣kius was entertained when he came home, nor how highly Pacius was respected. I shall only say, that the rare Man, Guillelmus Varius, who was then President of the Senate of Aix, and was afterward (as shall be told in its place) made Chancellour, could not sufficiently admire so excellent a wit, and so rare Learning, joyned with so much modesty; nor be satisfied with asking and hearing what he related so knowingly, so clearly, and with so much sweetnesse.\n\nA few daies after being upon this return with Pacius to Mon-pellier, he would needs go out of the way to shew him the Fountain De Vau-Cluse, not more famous for the plentifull streames of water issuing therefrom, then for the Loves of Petrarch and Laura: as also that tryumphant Arch, which is to be seen at Orenge thought to be built C. Marius, thought he judged it to be rather the work of Fabius Maximus; and like∣wise the City of Avenion, and the Bridge of\n\nWardon or Guardon, built with a triple row of Arches, and certain rarities at Nismes, which he had not before seen, though he had been there two years together.\n\nNow as soon as he returned, he fell to study the Lawes with so much Alacritie, that he daily spent ten whole houres therein; yet he was wont every day to spend some hours, especially towards Bed∣time, in the studies of Humanity and Antiquity. Which Pacius did not wholly dislike, being won∣derfully delighted to hear him discourse of divers things, especially belonging to the ancient Lawes; yea, and he did not only give way, but advized him, I may say, to see those ancient Monuments of Antiquitie at Narbon; but especially that Altar which was vowed and dedicated to Augus∣tus, of which being digged up thirty years be∣fore, he got the Picture printed at Burdeaux with the Illustrations of Elias Vinetus. For, the Book of Inscriptions of Gruterus, was not as yet brought unto him, in which he afterward observed, that the Tribuneship of Augustus, which Tacitus records to have been the 37th. in order, was by this very Inscription the thirty eighth.\n\nMoreover, because Pacius was very willing to discourse of matters pertaining to naturall Phi∣losophy; he took all occasions to ask him Questions touching the more abstruse causes of Nature; especially at such houres as were allow∣ed him for his Recreation. Thus happening one night upon certain scales of fishes, that shone in the darke, he gathered them together, and conveighed one privately into the study of Pacius; and afterwards entring with him, he on\n\npurpose, put out the Candle which he carried be∣fore him, that he being first amazed and then wondering at the light, he might ask him the Cause thereof. Pacius referred it to the Heat which was caused by Putrefaction. But Pei∣reskius asked him, Why therefore the Heat could not be felt, neither in those Scales, nor in rotten peices of wood? Why heaps of Corne growing hot by putrefaction, and quick lime wet with water and other things being so very hot, did not shine in like manner? Why, if glow-wormes shine by reason of heat, other living Creatures which are much hotter, should not also shine? To which Pacius answered, that the Heat which the Schooles call virtuall might suffice; and that befides, a certain disposition in the matter was re∣quisite, which is found in things which are not hot to the sense, but not in those which are sen∣sibly hot. I shall not stand to say how that when these and such like reasons could not satisfie Pei∣reskius; nothing seemed to him more probable, then that all light is a kind of flame, though very thin and exceeding subtile: which may be known by the Light of the Sun, which being con∣tracted and thickened is wont to burn; just as a va∣pour, is nothing but rarified water, which being again compacted and thickened, reassumes the forme of water. And whereas the direct or pri∣mary Light of the Sun, is yet pretty compact, so as it gives a sensible Heat; yet the reflected or secondary Light ther"
