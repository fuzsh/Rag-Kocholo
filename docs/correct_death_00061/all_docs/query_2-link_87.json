        "text": "Post by nomad on\n\nThe Dale Papers : The insect discoveries.\n\nThis article looks at some of insect discoveries of James Charles Dale (1791–1872) that he made in England between 1819-1845. Many of these insect discoveries that were either new to Britain or to science, were published by John Curtis in his British Entomology, being illustrations and descriptions of the genera of insects found in Great Britain and Ireland. John Curtis issued parts of his British Entomology, in no particular order between 1823 and 1840. When the last part of his work was published in 1840, the different parts were put into eight volumes of their respective insect orders. It is possible to tell when each description was originally issued in the original parts because Curtis added a date to the accompanying plate. Curtis who lived in London, visited Dale at Glanvilles Wootton in Dorset on a number of occasions, and among other places, they collected together in the New Forest in Hampshire and Parley Heath in adjoining county of Dorset. Further Dale and Curtis insect discoveries can be found in the forthcoming articles in this thread, An 1825 Entomological tour of Scotland and Collecting in the Lake District and the Manchester Mosses in 1827.\n\nFor futher information on Dale and specimens in his collection, see 'I would go through fire and water for insects'.\n\ncollector-secret.proboards.com/thread/512/dale-fire-water-insects\n\nThe Lulworth Skipper, Thymelicus acteon Rottemburg, 1775. Hesperiidae.\n\nThymelicus acteon is by far J. C. Dale's most famous discovery of a British insect. On August 14, 1832 Dale set out on horseback from the manor house at Glanvilles Wootton to travel the 25 miles to Lulworth on the coast of Dorset, he had his pair of pistols with him, in case of footpads. Nearing Lulworth he recorded in his diary that he observed Polyommatus coridon. The village of Lulworth is set at the head of Lulworth Cove, an imposing amphitheater of chalk cliffs rising above the sea. The next morning Dale left Lulworth, probably walking rather than riding over the whale backed down to the cliffs above Durdle door, a natural limestone arch. Here on the edge of the cliffs he records in his diary for August 15, \"Hesperia acteon plenty\". The capture of T. acteon in Britain was announced by John Curtis the following year 1833 in British Entomology vol 5, and he was more enthusiastic about the discovery than Dale appeared to be in his diary, he writes \" We cannot often hope to record the addition of a butterfly to our British Fauna, but this species was discovered at Lulworth Cove, last August by J.C. Dale, Esq, through whose liberality it now ornaments most of our cabinets; it was found upon Thistles, and is very local. The exact place where he took the first specimen is called Durdle Dove, and is situated to the west of Lulworth Cove. \" Curtis who gave the butterfly its English name, the Lulworth Skipper, illustrated the butterfly in his usual fine style, from specimens sent to him by Dale, figuring the male above and the female below. Since Dale's notable discovery, T. acteon has been found in other places long the Dorsetshire coast and inland on the Purbeck Hills of that county.\n\nThe Lulworth Skipper, Hesperia actaeon. John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 5, plate 442, 1832.\n\nThymelicus actaeon male. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nHalictophagus curtisii Dale 1832. Halictophagidae, Order Strepsiptera.\n\nOn August 15, 1832, when Dale added the Lulworth Skipper to the British list, he discovered two other insects that were new, a parasitic wasp, that C.W. Dale (1878) records as Eucyrtus Mirabilis, and Halictophagus curtisii, a small bee parasite of the order Strepsiptera, a genus which had been created by the Rev William Kirby. Dale's description of H. curtisii appeared in John Curtis' British Entomology, vol 3; he had discovered this tiny insect when cleaning his net from sweeping long grass after he returned to the inn at Lulworth from collecting at Durdle Door.\n\nThe Amateur Entomologist's Society web page (2017) gives a brief account of the Strepsiptera, \" These little insects live as parasites on other insects. As you can imagine, that means they must be small - no more than 4mm long in most cases. They are obligate parasites - which means that that is the only way they can live. And this means that they must have evolved to do this alongside their hosts, over many millions of years. In most species of Strepsiptera the females stay inside the insect they are parasites of (their host). This means that the females don't need wings. Neither do they need antennae, nor even legs. However, in a few types of Strepsiptera, the females get their own back on the free flying males by being able to reproduce by parthenogenesis. This means that they don't need males at all, and just lay eggs and produce offspring asexually, without males.\"\n\nHalictophagus curtisii.

Geometridae.\n\nCurtis (1825) recorded in his British Entomology that \" For the introduction of this rare species into our fauna we are indebted to J.C. Dale, who first took it on the trunk of an oak near Brockenhurst, Hants on 2nd June 1823. A second specimen was taken by Dale on the trunk of a Scotch Fir at Parley Heath in Dorset on 11th May 1824 and a third by him near Lyndhurst on 31st May 1824.\"\n\nThis species occurs in heathland and open woodland, it is very local in the southern counties of England, its headquarters have always been Hampshire's New Forest.

Corduliidae.\n\nSidney Charles Scarsdale Brown (1980) in an unpublished manuscript, J.C. Dale of Glanvilles Wootton, writes of Oxygastra curtisii \" On the 29th of June 1820, Dale, when at Parley, caught a dragonfly of the genus Cordulia, which be did not recognize, or could he identify it from the literature available to him at that time. It is most probable that he considered it to be a new species, but lacked the confidence and experience to name it. He came across it again in 1823. On June 8th 1831, he and Curtis were on Ramsdown together, and here they both took a single specimen. No doubt encouraged by Curtis, Dale finally decided to describe it, and named it in honour of his friend and companion. It would appear that curtisii was not at any time plentiful. In the Curtis collection, now in the National Museum of Victoria, Melbourne, are four specimens, two males and two females. The Notebook entry reads: \"July, common on Parley Heath, J.C.D. 1823, male and female at Hume, Dorset. In an article in Loudon's Magazine of Natural History, 1834 A list of the more rare of the Species of Insects found on Parley Heath, he said that he had taken a minimum of twelve, the number being expressive of fewer than those he had given away. This figure is in contrast with fifty of Gomphus vulgatissimus. Dale, like most of the entomologists of that time, was in the habit of taking very long series, probably for exchange. When he came across a rare or local species, he took all he could obtain.\"\n\nOxygastra curtisii. Dale collection. OUMNH.\n\nDale himself when describing the new Dragonfly as Cordulia curtisii in Loudon's Magazine of natural history and journal of zoology (1834) writes \" On June 29, 1820 I discovered a new Cordulia on Parley Heath, Hampshire. It is one of the finest insects I have ever found ; and I had proposed to name it after a certain friend, but objection had been made to its bearing his name, \" he not being the captor\" As it has remained nondescript up to this time, and is unnoticed, so far as I can found out, by Vander Linden, Charpentier, and other writers, I venture to descibe and name it after a friend whom I saw capture it ; and, as some jealously has been displayed on account of my having given a manuscript name only to Halictophagus curtisii, I request the favour of the following appearing in print. \"\n\nWhen alive, this species has an attractive melanic orange markings on the abdomen, which is lost in museum specimens. The habitat is slow flowing rivers and streams, however this species is now extinct in Britain, probably due to pollution of its last known habitat on the Moors river in Dorset where it was last recorded in 1957. It is also sadly extinct in Holland but occurs elsewhere over much of Europe.\n\nCordulia curtisii. John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 4, plate 616, 1836.\n\nJ.C. Dale captured a number of new insects on Parley Heath, he was credited with the discovery of the Speckled Footman, Coscinia cribraria bivittata South, 1900, there in 1820 by Brown (1980) but according to J.F. Stephens in his Illustrations of British Entomology, a William Bentley took two males the previous year in June 1819 near Ringwood. See\n\ncollector-secret.proboards.com/thread/1544/moths-men-endemic-british-subspecies\n\nParley Heath is situated near West Parley in south-eastern Dorset, here Dale owned a farm, he would arrive on horseback to collect here from Glanvilles Wootton, 35 miles away. The Moors river flows through the heath and in the western corner is Parley Copse which is shown on a map dated 1633. John Curtis in Dale's company, first collected insects on Parley Heath in 1822, and that year they also collected together in the New Forest.\n\nCryptocephalus biguttatus Scopoli, 1763. Chrysomelidae.\n\nCryptocephalus biguttatus is a rare and attractive beetle that is confined in Britain to wet heathlands in the New Forest, Dorset and Surrey. Curtis (1824) writes \" Nothing can prove completely the rapid progress of Entomology in this country than the extensive additions that have been made to this beautiful Genus within the last twelve years, amongst the most splendid of which is C. bipustulatus, a single specimen having been captured by Mr Dale near a coppice on Parley Heath, Dorset, 1st July 1823.\"\n\nCryptocephalus bipustulatus Fabricius, 1775 = Cryptocephalus biguttatus Scopoli, 1763.

Order Diptera.\n\nDale first met the great parson naturalist the Reverend William Kirby (1759 –1850) when he was at Cambridge University. Kirby spent his entire working life at the parsonage at Barham in Suffolk and was the author of several books and his most well known was written with William Spence, An Introduction to Entomology, published in four volumes between 1815 & 1826; he was a friend of John Curtis who he employed to work on the plates in 1819 for the latter work.\n\nOn July 7, 1821, Kirby and Dale were collecting together in the New Forest near Lyndhurst when Dale observed a specimen of the Lobster moth, Stauropus fagi, then considered a rarity. Dale was preparing to box the moth, when Kirby claimed he spotted it first, \" take it\" said Dale. Shortly afterwards, Dale took something much rarer, the first British specimen of the hornet-mimicking Cranefly, Ctenophora ornata. Kirby said \" Now Dale, I change with you\", \"No\" replied Dale, \" The Lobster moth I may take a future day, but the fly never\" Dale was right in his assumption, for no other British specimen of this rare fly was taken again until 60 years later to the day when his son, Charles William Dale in the company of the Rev. C.R. Digby, found one on the trunk of an oak tree at Lyndhurst on July 7, 1881. C. ornata is mainly confined in the UK to Windsor Forest in Berkshire and to the New Forest.\n\nCtenophora ornata. John Curtis (1823-1840), British Entomology, vol 8, plate 5 1824.\n\nThe Durham Tinea, Acrolepiopsis betulella Curtis, 1838. Glyphipterigidae.\n\nIn August 1837, Dale made his last major journey in search of rare insects, travelling to Castle Eden Dene, County Durham in Northern England, to secure Polyommatus salmacis. J.F. Stephens (1829) in his Illustrations of British Entomology, vol 3, p 235, had described P. salmacis as a new species, after specimens were sent to him from that locality by George Wailes. Castle Eden Dene is a steep wooded ravine that leads down to limestone grassland by the sea, the habitat of salmacis, which is now recognized as a subspecies of Aricia artaxerxes. Here Dale succeeded in taking a series of salmacis and also found Erebia aethiops to be common in the grassy wooded clearings, sadly this population is now extinct there, however, a small population of A. artaxerxes salmacis still occurs in that locality.\n\nAricia artaxerxes salmacis.

Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nWhile he was collecting in the Dene, Dale took specimens of a moth from small birch trees that was new to science, which Curtis in 1838, described as Acrolepia betulella, a species that has now been placed genus Acrolepiopsis. This is a rare moth being found in a few localities in the 20th century in Scotland and which was thought extinct in County Durham but was rediscovered there in 2012, after being last seen there 120 years earlier. The larvae feed on Ramsons, Allium ursinum.\n\nAcrolepia betulella. John Curtis (1823-1840), British Entomology, vol 6, plate 679, 1838.\n\nMottled bee-fly Thyridanthrax fenestratus Fallén, 1814. Bombyliidae\n\nDale added this uncommon beefly to the British list when he found it at Parley Heath, Dorset in July 1821, and shortly afterwards at St. Leonard's and Hurne in the same country. John Curtis who referred to this species as Anthrax ornata Hoffmansegg, 1824, a synonym of Thyridanthrax fenestratus, Fallén, 1814 took specimens near the centre of Parley Heath and others at nearby Ramsdown.\n\nThis is an attractive species with patterned wings is confined in Britain to the heathlands of Dorset, the New Forest, Surrey and Berkshire, where it can be found basking on the sandy ground. The larvae are parasitoids of the Heath Sand-wasp Ammophila pubescens, and the adults can often be seen hovering over the nesting areas of the wasp in dry sand between clumps of heather.\n\nAnthrax ornata = Thyridanthrax fenestratus. John Curtis (1823-1840), British Entomology, vol 8, plate 9, 1824.\n\n.\n\nAnthaxia nitidula Linnaeus, 1758. Buprestidae.\n\nCurtis (1824) writes in British Entomology, vol 2, \" This brilliant little species was first detected by Mr Dale and myself, the early part of last June 1824 in an excursion in the New Forest ; we beat four out of whitethorn flowers in the neighbourhood of Brockenhurst, in the heat of the day, at which time they flew with great celerity. Mr Dale has subsequently taken it as early as the 19th May.\" In Britain this jewel beetle, is very local being confined to the New Forest where the wood boring larvae feed in Prunus (Blackthorn) and Crataegus (Hawthorn) stems.\n\nBuprestis nitidula.

He added the Reed Tussock, Laelia coenosa to the British list, when he found a caterpillar of that species, which unfortunately died. On July 23 at Trundle Mere, he captured a noctuid moth which was new to science, which Curtis in 1829, named Apamea Haworthii in honour of Adrian Hardy Haworth (1767-1833). C. haworthii is found on the northern moorlands, the heaths of southern England and the fens of East Anglia, where the larva foodplant Cotton-grass, Eriphorium species grows.\n\nDale records in his Entomological calendar that he first visited Whittlesea Mere on July 16, 1814, when he saw Papilio machaon in profusion and took several Phryganea grandis, the largest British caddisfly. The next day, the 17th, he was at Stilton Fen to the west of Whittlesea Mere, where he saw further P. machaon and took the Small China-mark, Cataclysta lemnata of the Crambidae family.\n\nApamea Haworthii. John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 5, plate 260, 1829.\n\nEmus hirtus Linnaeus, 1758. Staphylinidae.\n\nOne of Dale's best finds on Parley Heath was the strange furry and flexible Hairy Rove beetle, Emus hirtus, which he discovered there on May 16, 1821. This beetle which breeds in cow and horse dung, has always been always regarded as a rarity in Britain and is now classified as endangered being confined to the New Forest and a few other sites in southern England.\n\nEmus hirtus John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 1, plate 534, 1835.\n\nShore Wainscot, Mythimna litoralis Curtis, 1827. Noctuidae » Hadeninae.\n\nOn July 8, 1824 Dale was collecting at the sandhills of the strangely named Mount Misery at Bournemouth on the coast of Dorset, when he captured a moth that was new to science which Curtis in 1827, named Leucania littoralis. The sandhills where Dale originally found the moth have long since vanished under the urban spread of Bournemouth. This species is found locally in sand dunes around the English and Welsh coastlines where the larva feed on marram (Ammophila arenaria) during the night and hide during the day in the sand.\n\nLeucania littoralis.

This specimen seems to have escaped the attention of the authors on British Lepidoptera, not being mentioned in any of their works.\n\nClavigesta sylvestrana Curtis, 1850. Tortricidae\n\nCollecting at Bournemouth, on August 12, 1845 Dale discovered a moth of the Tortricidae family that was new to science. It was described as Spilonota sylvestrana by John Curtis in 1850, in The Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Notes upon the smaller British Moths, with descriptions of some nondescript or imperfectly characterized species ; Curtis writes \" was first discovered by Mr Dale at Bournemouth, and from 23rd June to the 1st July we found it there in 1846. It inhabits the Pinasters on the cliffs, and we beat it into our nets in the daytime.\" In Britain, this is a southern species, being found where the larva foodplants, coniferous trees, in particular maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) occur.\n\nMasoreus wetterhallii Gyllenhal, 1813. Carabidae.\n\nChesil Beach on the Dorset Coast is 29 kilometers in length, consisting of a raised shingle bank ; here Dale was collecting at its eastern end, beneath the Isle of Portland, when turning stones, he found a ground beetle that Curtis in 1829, named Masoreus luxatus, synonym of Masoreus wetterhallii Gyllenhal, 1813. In Britain this is scarce species and is found in only a few coastal localities.\n\nMasoreus luxatus = Masoreus wetterhallii. John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 1, plate 237, 1829.\n\nYpsolopha asperella. Linnaeus, 1761. Family Ypsolophidae.\n\nDale added this species to the British list when he took specimens on hawthorn and apples, in the orchard of his manor house at Glanvilles Wootton on September 8, 1815 ; he presented a pair to J.F. Stephens. Dale captured it again there October 1, 1819, September 8, 19, 1921 and September 17, 1831. After his journey to collect insects in the Lake District in 1827, John Curtis stayed with Dale at Glanvilles Wootton, and he took Y. asperella there in the orchard on October 17. The only other county where this species was recorded was Herefordshire. However, this moth has not been seen in the British Isles since 1886 and is regarded as extinct. The Larval foodplants include apple (Malus) and hawthorn (Crataegus)\n\nOxycera morrisii Curtis 1833. Stratiomyidae order Diptera.\n\nDale discovered Oxycera morrisii on the undercliff near Lyme Regis and named it in a unpublished manuscript in honour of the Reverend Francis Orpen Morris ( 1810– 1893) who had added a number of rare soldier flies (Stratiomyidae) to the British list from the same locality. The name was published by John Curtis in British Entomology in 1833. Morris was born in Ireland and wrote a number of books on Entomology and Ornithology. In 1852 he published A History of British Butterflies and in 1859–70 A History of British Moths in 4 volumes. Morris seems to have had a turbulent relationship with Dale. S.C.S. Brown in an unpublished manuscript, The Dale Archives (1980) gives some details from the letters that Morris sent to Dale, he writes \" Morris wrote a number of rude letters to Dale. Dale in one of his repiles said that the book British Butterflies, Morris being the author \" was not worth a place in the library of any but a mere tyro\" Morris complained that Dale had addressed letters to him as Parson Morris and Flycatcher. \" O. morrisii is a rare species and occurs near springs and seepages in a scattered distribution in Britain. It is usually swept as an adult, and has rarely been photographed.\n\nOxycera morrisii. John Curtis (1823-1840) British Entomology, vol 8. plate 441, 1833.\n\nStylops Dalii Curtis, 1828. Stylopidae. Strepsiptera.\n\nStylops Dalii was named in J.C. Dale's honour by his lifelong friend John Curtis in British Entomology. This is another bee parasite of the order Strepsiptera, in his description of the new insect in British Entomology, Curtis gives details sent to him by Dale of its discovery. \" Every specimen of Andrena barbilabris (*Sandpit Mining bee) I have seen this year, from the 27th April to the 4th June, have contained larvae, pupae, or exuviae of Stylops, from one to three in each. On the 5th May I picked one out with a pin, on the seventh another rather immature, and caught one flying in the hot sunshine over a quickset hedge in the garden ; it looked milk-white on the wing, with a jet black body, and totally unlike anything else ; it flew with an undulating or vacillating motion amongst the young shoots, and I could not catch it till it settled on one, when it ran up and down, its wings in motion, and making a considerable buzz or hum nearly as loud as a Sesia : it twisted about its rather long tail, and turned it up like a Stayphylinus (*Rove beetle). I put it under a glass and placed it in the sun ; it became quite furious in its confinement, and never ceased running about for two hours. The elytra or processes were kept in quick vibration, as well as its wings ; it buzzed against the sides of the glass, with its head touching it, and tumbled about on its back\". (* My italics)\n\n\" By putting two bees of A. labialis under a glass in the sun, two Stylops were produced ; the bees seemed uneasy and went up towards them, but evidently with caution, as if to fight, and moving there antennae towards them retreated. I once thought the bee attempted to seize it; but the oddest thing was to see the Stylops get on the body of the bee and ride about,, the latter using every effort to throw its ride. A large hole is left in the tail of the bee when the Stylops escapes, which closes up after a time. I have found five species of Andrena infested. \"\n\nStylops Dalii.

The figure of this insect is much enlarged, for its actual size, see the tiny figure beneath.\n\nPost by nomad on\n\nThe Entomological Library of James Charles Dale.\n\n\"The first letter kept by Dale is the purchase of books in 1813 from the London dealer Tuther. All the books in his library had an elaborate book-plate bearing his coat-of-arms. In nearly all his purchases he kept the invoices and made notes concerning the prices which he paid. Up to 1844 these can be found in his Diary No.17. The library was sold by auction on May 23rd 1906 at Stevens\". (Brown 1980, Unpublished manuscript).\n\nJames Charles Dale certainly would have spent much time in his library at the manor house, Glanvilles Wootton, his entomological book collection consisted of some of the rarest known entomological works. Being wealthy he was able to purchase an extensive collection of entomological books but his library does shows the extent of Dale's wide interest in all aspects of entomology.\n\nThis article lists the entomological books that were in Dale's library and there are brief details on some of the works and authors. Although the Dale collection, is primary a collection of British insects, he did have a smaller collection of exotic and other Lepidoptera. Dale had many notable early works on British and European insects, with some of the few books that were published at that time regarding World Lepidoptera.\n\nEleazar Albin (fl. 1690 – 1759) A Natural History of English Insects, London, 1720.\n\nDale purchased a copy of this work in 1849 from the book seller and antiquarian Thomas Kerslake (1812–1891) of Park Street, Bristol for £6.6.0. In 1849 Kerslake was offering for sale Albins original drawings of A Natural History of English Insects and according to Charles William Dale, his father purchased them. In 1849 J.C. Dale purchased another copy of this work, the 1749 edition at Stevens auction rooms.\n\nAlbin's A Natural History of English Insects took seven years to produce with help from wealthy patrons, such as the Duchess Dowager of Beaufort ; each plate commemorating a subscriber. It was the first work depicting butterflies in colour but only 15 species were represented, most of the Lepidoptera were moths, with a few other insects, all in hand coloured plates. Albin also produced A Natural History of Birds (1731–38) and The Natural History of Spiders and other Curious Insects (1736). Not much is known about Albin, he had a large family and being from London, he mentions the collecting localities of Hampstead Heath, Highgate and Chelsea, then just country villages.\n\nEleazar Albin.

The Natural History of British Insects was issued in parts between 1792 and 1833, eventually becoming 16 volumes, although the work was also bound into eight volumes. There was a random selection of insects issued on 576 plates, while some were quite acceptable and very good illustrated figures, others were of a lesser quality.\n\nDonovan produced other works on exotic insects, and the hand coloured plates by the author are of a very high quality, among those volumes that were in the Dale collection were, An Epitome of the Natural History of Insects of China (1798), An Epitome of the Natural History of Insects of India (1804) (which included many insects of the Dutch East Indies) and An Epitome of the Natural History of the Insects of New Holland, New Zealand, New Guinea, Otaheite and other islands in the Southern and Pacific Oceans (1805). Many of the specimens for the latter work were provided by Joseph Banks from James Cook's first great voyage (1768–1771) and William Bayly, an astronomer on the second and third voyages of James Cook. All three volumes of Donovan's exotic insects were bought by Dale from George Willis, a well known London bookseller for between £1 & £1 4.O, those of India & China in 1847 and New Holland in 1858.\n\nDonovan was an avid collector of natural history specimens that he purchased mainly at the J.C. Stevens auction rooms in Covent Gardens in London. In 1807 he founded the London Museum and Institute of Natural History. Having spent vast sums on specimens, he said that because of unscrupulous book publishers, and because of the economic decline in England after the Napoleonic Wars, this forced the closure of his museum in 1817 and he had to auction his collections in 1818 at Stevens. He spent the last of his money in lawsuits to reclaim monies owed to him by his publishers but died penniless in 1837, leaving a large family destitute.\n\nPapilio apollo.

The work contained plates by his fellow Aurelian, the celebrated Moses Harris, although some of those in the last volume are by a different hand, Because of the scarcity of these three volumes, they were reissued and revised by J.O. Westwood in 1837 as Illustrations of Exotic Entomology containing upwards of six hundred and fifty figures. Dale bought the later work from George Willis of London in 1846 for £4 16. 6.\n\nDrury was a wealthy London silver smith and was able to build up a large collection of 11,000 specimens, corresponding with a number of entomologists from all over the world from India to Jamaica and America. His collection he said had cost him at least £4000, being sold after his death at auction by King and Lochee in 1805, but realized only the modest sum of £614, many of the specimens being bought by his friends William Kirby and Edward Donovan, the latter preparing the sales catalogue of his exotic insects.\n\nDru Drury (Westwood), Illustrations of Exotic Entomology, 1837, plate 1\n\nFig1.

Haworth wrote in a letter to Dale dated October 21, 1821, that the remainder of his Lepidoptera Britannica was in the hands of W. Savage, who said that he would charge nothing for printing it, and that Haworth would receive all the profits from the sale. Later Haworth said that Wood the Bookseller printed the last part of Lepidoptera Britannica and that the price per copy was 10/6. The total number printed was 250. By 1862, the well known entomologist, William Forsell Kirby mentioned in a letter to Dale that Lepidoptera Britannica had become a very scarce work.\n\nHaworth besides being an entomologist, was a carcinologist and botanist, the curator of the Aurelian cabinet, after the third society was formed in 1801. Haworth was a wealthy collector of private means, building up a very large collection of insects with 40,000 specimens, half of them Lepidoptera which was sold in 1833 at J.C.

Lewin included a number of new British butterflies in his work, Cupido minimus (allus), Coenonympha tulla (C. hero) and two very notable species, Maculinea arion and Lycaena dispar (hippothoe). Lewin gave the latter butterfly the English name of the Large Copper and wrongly assumed it was Lycaena hippothoe. Even though Haworth in 1802 identified it as a distinct species dispar, successive authors as late as 1878, would continue to refer to the butterfly as the continental L. hippothoe.\n\nHippothoe (L. dispar).

The work is thought to contain twenty British butterflies but two doubtfully native butterflies were also included, Parnassius apollo and Iphiclides podalirius ; Mouffet studied medicine in Switzerland and may have observed the latter two butterflies there.He lived in London, was a physician and had Puritan beliefs.\n\nThomas Mouffet (1634) Title page of Insectorum Minimorum Animalium Theatrum.\n\nChristopher Merrett (1614–1695) Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum, 1666.\n\nThis work like the last was written in Latin and represents the first attempt to list all the native fauna and flora, containing one of the first statements by an Englishman on the organic origin of fossils, there were no illustrations. Merrett was like Mouffet a physician, but he was mainly a herbalist, his work is thought to contain at least 20 butterflies species. E.B. Ford in Butterflies (1943) pointed that the list of British butterflies is a curious one and would not have represented all the butterflies known to Mouffet. The inclusion of Lycaena hippothoe has caused some speculation that it was once a British native butterfly but this seems unlikely.\n\nChristopher Merrett (1666) Title page of Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum.\n\nJoseph Palisot, Baron de Beauvois.

The feud surprised many because Curtis' younger brother C.M. Curtis illustrated some of the fine plates in Stephen's book. Stephens first letter to Dale was written in 1819 but there correspondence ceased in 1827, probably because of his close friendship with Curtis.

Dale's tutor at Enborne was the Reverend Thomas Shephard MA. At this time Dale began an entomological journal to record his captures which he continued up to his death in 1872. Dale seems to have enjoyed his school days at Enborne, he spent all his free time in the woods and meadows collecting butterflies. His favourite collecting ground was Enborne Copse that was situated just to the north of the village. Among the many butterflies that he collected there were Apatura Iris, Limenitis camilla and Argynnis adippe, three species that were absent from the woodlands of Glanvilles Wootton. Enborne Copse has survived to the present day, it is mainly an oak woodland with old coppiced stools of small-leaved lime Tilia cordata, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because of the rich flora that is found there. One can imagine young Dale on a pleasant afternoon, finishing his lessons, putting away his school books and heading the short distance to the woodland with his large clap net and boxes. Dale recorded his own captures of Lepidoptera at Enborne between 1807 and 1810 and also those made there by Edward Shaw between 1811 and 1814. Dale went up to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge in January 1811 and graduated an MA in 1818. He returned to stay at Enborne in July 1815, where he had much success in capturing A. iris. Dale's first insect cabinet was made for him from elm wood, while he was at school at Enborne. A second cabinet was purchased in 1816 from Ellis, cabinet makers of Sherborne. In 1817 William Elford Leach of the British Museum sold Dale a cabinet for £2.\n\nThe parish of Glanvilles Wootton is situated in the Blackmoor Vale in the county of Dorset, and during the period when the Dale family owned the manor and its estate, it was mainly pasture that was divided into diary farms. The parish was well wooded with Mullet's Copse, Whitedown Copse, Sandhills Copse, Buttons Copse, Great Wootton Wood and Broad Alders Coppice, all of these survive to the present day except the first two. In the parish of Minterne Magna to the west are the extensive woods of Middlemarsh that were once part of the Royal hunting forest of Selwood. A prominent feature to the south of the manor house, above Great Wootton Wood and Broad Alders Coppice is the 600 feet high Dungeon Hill. A mile to the east was Newlands Common that was covered in gorse and heather, but this had disappeared by 1878. All of these localities were much visited by Dale and by his sons William and Edward to collect insects.\n\nIn his first Entomological Journal, a calendar, Dale recorded the species that he saw or collected from 1807 until 1812, often using English names. There is only one entry for 1807, regarding a number of the large larvae of the moth Gastropacha quercifolia that he collected at Enborne in June, which pupated but died. A second entomological calendar by Dale begins with the records of the Reverend Charles Abbot of Bedford between 1798-1803, that were taken from his diary, then continues with his own records from 1808 until 1835. This calendar cannot have been written before 1817, as that is the year Abbot's diary and collection was purchased by Dale. Scientific names are only used in this journal. There is also a separate entomological diary for 1815.\n\nOnly a few of the specimens that Dale collected at Glanvilles Wootton or Enborne are labelled with those localities, which is usually placed at their side in the cabinet drawers, usually without a date, although occasionally a reference to his diary may give some idea when an actual specimen was captured. A few of the rarer species do have the actual date of their capture, which was also recorded in Dale's journals. All the specimens shown here are from the Dale collection in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and most were caught over 200 hundred years ago at either Glanvilles Wootton or Enborne, early in the 19th century. The fact that J.C. Dale kept data regarding many of his specimens is very important to future researches studying 19th century British Leopidoptera because many of the collections of his famous contemporaries, such as those of Henry Doubleday and James Francis Stephens that are in the British Museum are without any data.\n\nThe Butterflies of Glanvilles Wootton and Enborne recorded by J.C. Dale.\n\nThe following is an account of the butterflies that J.C. Dale collected between 1808 & 1815, while he was at boarding School at Enborne and in his own parish of Glanvilles Wootton, with a reference to some later records. Dale's son Charles William, the author of The History of Glanville's Wootton, published in 1878, gave details of the Lepidoptera of the parish that included information from his late father's journals. Even taking into account that many of the species collected by Dale were far more common in the earlier part of the 19th Century than they are today, his records of butterflies that he collected in those early years is very impressive.\n\nAmong the butterflies collected by Dale are several species that are now extinct in Britain, these are Nymphalis polychloros, Cyaniris semiargus and Aporia crataegi. One special butterfly, a transitory resident for a few years at Glanvilles Wootton was Papilio machaon gorganus. Dale in his journals omits the following butterflies that were abundant, Thymelicus sylvestris, Pieris brassicae, Pieris napi, Pieris rapae, Aglais urticae, Aphantopus hyperantus, Pyronia tithonus and Coenonympha pamphilus. The status of each species in Britain at the present time is given in this account, so as to compare the distribution in the earlier part of the 19th Century. When Dale began collecting Lepidoptera, George III was on the throne. All the historical specimens shown here are from the Dale Collection, in the Entomology Department of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nAnthocharis cardamines Linnaeus, 1758. Pieridae\n\nThe first butterfly that Dale recorded that he captured in his journal was Pontia cardamines at Enborne on the 2 May 1808. He took it again two days later on the 4 May 1808. The earliest that he met with the butterfly at Enborne was the 30 April 1810. His first record of this species at Glanvilles Wootton was on the 11 June 1813. Today in warm springs A. cardamines has started to appear in March, flying until early June. This beautiful species is widespread and still common throughout Britain.\n\nAnthocharis cardamines males.

Pieridae.\n\nOn the 3 May 1808 at Enborne Dale captured his first specimen of Gonepteryx rhamni and he took the over-wintering brood there that year as late as the 14 June. He took the first specimen of the new brood on the 31 August 1809 at Glanvilles Wootton. It seems to have been generally abundant at both localities and remains common and widespread butterfly today, being seen in recent years on warm days as early as February but more generally in March, flying until May, with a second generation appearing in July and August.\n\nGonepteryx rhamni male. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nCelastrina argiolus Linnaeus, 1758. Lycaenidae.\n\nDale captured a specimen of the first brood of Celastrina argiolus on the 3 May 1808 at Enborne. He took the butterfly again, which he placed in the genus Lyceana at Enborne on the 1 & 14 May 1809. He seemed to have been pleased with these captures because he unlined them in red ink, as he did with his other notable specimens. The first brood of this butterfly seems to be common enough at Enborne but Dale recorded no captures in his journal of the second brood during his summer holidays at Glanvilles Wootton between 1808 & 1815. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that it was only occasional at Glanvilles Wootton in April and May and again in August. There is seasonal variation between the spring and summer broods. Today this butterfly is widespread and often common in England and Wales but rare in Scotland, however there is a great fluctuation in numbers, due in some years to the heavy parasitism of the larva.\n\nCelastrina argiolus. A male of the second brood. Glanvilles Wootton, July. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nAglais io Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nDales first capture of this lovely species was on the 4 May 1808 at Enborne of an individual that had been in hibernation through the winter. He took his first specimen of the new brood at Glanvilles Wootton on the 30 July 1808. It appeared to be common at Enborne, although C.W. Dale (1878) stated that at Glanvilles Wootton there was a fluctuation in numbers, common in some years, none seen in others. It is still a common and widespread species in Britain.\n\nAglais io. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nNymphalis polychloros Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nThe first specimen Dale took of this butterfly which he placed in the genus Vanessa was at Enborne on the 4 May 1808, certainly an over-wintering butterfly and he again captured the butterfly at Enborne on the 6 May 1809. He took an example of the new generation there on the 28 July 1810. He took his first specimen at Glanvilles Wootton on the 7 August 1808, and again there the 1 April 1817, then not until many years later on the 23 & 24 March 1858, when his last sightings of this species were made in the parish. C.W. Dale took a further four specimens at Glanvilles Wootton, the last he recorded was in the Cowlease meadow on the 11 May 1878. It certainly seems to have been of a sporadic occurrence at Glanvilles Wootton. Sadly today this impressive butterfly is extinct in Britain.\n\nNymphalis polychloros female. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nVanessa cardui Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nA specimen of a newly arrived immigrant was taken by Dale at Enborne on the 4 May 1808, a fairly early date and no doubt it had flown direct from Spain. He took further specimens there that year the 16 May and the 16 & 28 October, and his first specimen at Glanvilles Wootton on the 19 July. Dale's next captures of the butterfly were on the 13 July 1810 at Enborne and at Glanvilles Wootton on the 3 August of that year. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that the butterfly was locally common in some years at Glanvilles Wootton, in others none were seen. There have been notable years when this species arrives in Britain in its thousands, in others it appears in small numbers and just like C.W. Dale observed many years ago, in some years you may struggle to find a single individual.\n\nVanessa cardui. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nPyrgus malvae Linnaeus, 1758. Hesperiidae.\n\nDale recorded the attractive little skipper as Hesperia malvae at Enborne on the 11 May 1808 and again there in the 6, 11 & 15 May 1809. It seems to have been fairly common at Enborne. Dale does not appear to have taken this species before 1815 at Glanvilles Wootton. Dale gives the correct specific name of malvae in his journal, but this was later crossed out in pencil and the name alveolus added to the page. C.W. Dale in his History of Glanville's Wootton (1878) referred to this species as the Syrichthus alveolus of Hubner 1803, a synonym of Pyrgus malvae Linnaeus, 1758, he added that it was fairly common in the woods of Glanvilles Wootton. This species has much declined in the UK, many woodland colonies have been lost.\n\nPyrgus malvae. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nCallophrys rubi Linnaeus, 1758. Lycaenidae.\n\nDale found his first Callophrys rubi (then placed in the genus Thecla) at Enborne on the 15 May 1808 on whitethorn, a name usually used in this period for the hawthorn. In localities where there are colonies of C. rubi on hawthorn, the butterflies are hard to distinguish when they are at rest due to their very beautiful green undersides. Dale took his first specimen at Glanvilles Wootton on the 16 May 1815 after his return from Cambridge. C.W. Dale (1878) noted it was only of an occasional occurrence there. This species is still widespread and frequent in suitable localities throughout Britain.\n\nCallophrys rubi. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nLycaena phlaeas Linnaeus, 1761. Lycaenidae.\n\nThe first capture of this butterfly by Dale was on the 15 May 1808 at Enborne and at Glanvilles Wootton on the 4 July 1808. It was common and frequent in both localities. C.W. Dale recorded that it was sometimes abundant at Glanvilles Wootton and that he had met with it at late as November. Much declined in numbers in the UK, it is still fairly widespread throughout Britain. The latest I have encountered this butterfly is during October, probably of a third brood.\n\nVanessa atalanta Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale took his first specimen of this beautiful and well known butterfly on the 16 May 1808, almost certainly of a newly arrived immigrant and his first specimen at Glanvilles Wootton was taken on the 30 June 1808. C.W. Dale (1878) observed it was common at Glanvilles Wootton in the autumn feeding at blackberries and fallen apples. Today with a warming Britain, this butterfly is able to hibernate through the winter, although numbers are still built up by immigrants. With a large immigration in May 2017, numbers increased through breeding, and it was common in the autumn, however the 2017-2018 winter in the UK was very cold, with a late spring, very few butterflies of this species were able to survive their hibernation.\n\nBoloria euphrosyne Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nWhen Dale recorded woodland fritillary it was placed in the genus Melitaea. He took his first specimens at Enborne Copse on the 22 May 1908 and at Glanvilles Wootton in the grounds of the manor house on the 26 May 1915. C.W. Dale (1878) noted it was abundant in all the woods at Glanvilles Wootton from April to June, as it was in many parts of England. One most sadly reflect that this is not the case in Britain today, and that this butterfly is now regarded as rare, having disappeared from many southern counties where it was once widespread and common.\n\nBoloria euphrosyne. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nErynnis tages Linnaeus, 1758. Hesperiidae.\n\nThis butterfly was first recorded by Dale as Hesperia Tages at Enborne on the 24 May 1808 and the 8 July 1808 at Glanvilles Wootton, the latter was probably a specimen of the rare second brood. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that it was occasional there in May and June. In spite of a marked decline, it still widespread throughout most of Britain.\n\nErynnis tages. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nHamearis lucina Linnaeus, 1758. Riodinidae\n\nBecause of its appearance this butterfly was once classified as a fritillary of the family Nymphalidae. Dale recorded it as Melitaea lucina, it is in fact the only European member of the Riodinidae family. This butterfly was first captured by Dale at Enborne on the 28 May 1808, being frequent in the woods there, but it was very rare at Glanvilles Wootton, and first taken there by Dale in the manor house orchard on the 27 May 1833, then on only three other occasions, at Whitedown Copse 25 June 1837, in Mullet's Copse 29 May 1833 and in that locality the 28 May 1841. H. lucina was more frequent in the Middlemarsh Woods to west, where Dale made the last capture with his son Edward on the 7 June 1868. This species has seen one of the sharpest declines of any butterfly species in Britain.\n\nHamearis lucina females. Top a specimen from Glanvilles Wootton and bottom a female from Middlemarsh Woods. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nAricia agestis Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775. Lycaenidae\n\nDale in his early collecting years, seems to have followed A.H. Haworth (1803) and regarded this species as the idas of Linnaeus, 1761, a dimorphic species with a blue male and brown female that does not occur in Britain. He first captured Aricia agestis at Enborne on the 30 May 1808 and at Glanvilles Wootton on the 20 June 1808, where it was common until 1830, but then became scarce. It remains fairly widespread and frequent in England and Wales except in the central region of the latter country.\n\nAricia agestis male. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nOchlodes sylvanus Esper, 1777. Hesperiidae.\n\nFirst recorded by Dale as Hesperia sylvanus at Enborne on the 2 June 1808 and at Glanvilles Wootton the 13 June 1813. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that it was abundant at Glanvilles Wootton. A frequent species in Britain as far north as Ayrshire in Scotland.\n\nOchlodes sylvanus female. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nBoloria selene Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775. Nymphalidae.\n\nThe butterfly was placed in the genus Melitaea at the time Dale first encountered this butterfly on the 5 June 1808 at Enborne. At Glanvilles Wootton Dale first recorded B. selene on the 19 June 1813, where it was only an occasional occurrence there in the woodlands. Much declined and rare in southern England, its strongholds are in south-west England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nPolygonia c-album Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale took his first specimen at Enborne on the 12 June 1808, and at Glanvilles Wootton on the 27 July 1808. The last specimen was captured there on the 22 April 1836, with the previous capture being made on the 8 October 1816. There was a huge decline in the species during the 19th century. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that it had completely disappeared from Dorset. The reasons for the decline are thought to have been reduction in hop farming. Hop being the larval foodplant at the time. The butterfly became restricted to the counties bordering the upper River Severn. During the 1960s the butterfly once again extended its range and the preferred larva foodplant was now the common nettle. Today it is to be found throughout England and Wales and has extended its range northwards into Scotland.\n\nPolygonia c-album. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nPolyommatus icarus Rottemburg, 1775. Lycaenidae.\n\nSurprisingly when Dale first captured this butterfly he recorded his specimens as Lycaena dorylas, even though Haworth (1803) had given the butterfly the correct name of icarus. Polyommatus dorylas Denis & Schiffermüller 1775 is a species that does not occur in the UK. Dale's first specimen of Polyommatus icarus was taken on the 14 June 1808 at Enborne. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded it as being abundant at Glanvilles Wootton from May to October. An extreme obsolete aberration of P. icarus was taken by J.C. Dale on the 5 August 1826 at Buckland Newton in Dorset. The butterfly is widespread in Britain but absent from the Shetland Islands.\n\nPolyommatus icarus female. Glanvilles Wootton and an extreme underside obsolete aberration. Buckland Newton, Dorset, 1826. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nCyaniris semiargus Rottemburg, 1775. Lycaenidae.\n\nDale in his early journals referred to this butterfly as Lycaena cymon, a name given to this species by William Lewin in 1795. The population of C. semiargus that occurred at Glanvilles Wootton was on part of the estate known as Mullett's Long ground, which was situated between Mullett's copse and Dungeon Hill. There was one brood a year in June and July. A female of this species was first taken by Dale on the 22 June 1808 and further females were captured on the 26 & 27 June 1808 and the 1 & 6 July 1808. The first male was captured on the 24 July 1811. The butterfly was recorded at Glanvilles Wootton in most years until 1841, when the last pair were captured on the 19 June. There seems to have been a number of discrete colonies in Dorset, with J.C. Dale in Newman (1869) recording Parley Copse, Powerstock and Haselbury Bryan as localities where the butterfly had previously been found. Brown (1980) from information taken from Dale's manuscripts, gives West Parley 1816 and again captured there on the 28 May 1833 by T. Vine. This species had become very rare in Britain by the latter part of the 19th century and its extinction followed soon after. A number of reasons have been suggested for its lost in Britain. These have included changes in farming practices, resulting in the butterfly vanishing from meadows. However, colonies of this species were also found in chalkland grassland, heathland and in open woodland sites.\n\nCyaniris semiargus. 1, 3 & 5. Males. 2 & 4. Females. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH. The first female (second image) and last male (fifth image) were figured by E.B. Ford in The New Naturalist Butterflies (1945) on plate 1 Historic Butterflies.\n\nMelanargia galathea serena Verity 1913. Nymphalidae.\n\nAt the time this butterfly was first captured by Dale at Enborne on the 8 July 1809, it was placed in the genus Hipparchia. It was surprisingly rare at Glanvilles Wootton, Dale taking it there on the 30 June 1808, and then on a few other occasions, with his last capture being made on the 28 July 1836. C.W. Dale took a specimen in Cowleaze meadow, Glanvilles Wootton on the 22 July 1869, but it then disappeared from the parish. The butterfly is still found in scattered colonies in suitable places in England as far north as Yorkshire and in South Wales.\n\nMelanargia galathea serena female. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nPapilio machaon gorganus Fruhstorfer, 1922. Papilionidae.\n\nPapilio machaon gorganus was another special butterfly that was found at Glanvilles Wootton and in other parts of Dorset during the late 18th and early 19th century. These transitory populations were as the results of immigrants that had arrived from the continent. Dale recorded that on the 9 June 1806 he and his sister were taken by their father to Batcombe Hill, in West Dorset to see a colt broken in, and his sister saw several P. machaon there. When Dale was at Wimborne School, he became friends with a fellow pupil named Stovey whose father was Reverend W. Stovey of Hinton Martell near Cranborne in Dorset. Dale records that the Reverend Stovey had specimens of P. machaon in his collection taken the vicinity of Cranborne. Brown (1980) mentions that while Dale was at school in Wimborne he saw P.machaon and when he visited Merley House on the outskirts of the town, he saw a case of that butterfly that were taken locally.\n\nDale captured his first specimen of P. machaon gorganus at Glanvilles Wootton on the 26 July 1808, and in August of that year he took 12 specimens in three consecutive days. He then captured it in successive years until the last specimen, a female was taken on the 15 August 1815 at Newlands Common. The following year on the 22 June 1816 his saw a single P. machaon feeding on a thistle on Dungeon Hill, but did not capture it. Remarkably out of the numerous specimens of ssp gorganus taken by Dale only one survives in his collection, the last female specimen taken on Newlands Common. This would appear to be very strange, until one realizes that during this period, entomologists did not differentiate the taxons we know today as P. machaon gorganus and Papilio machaon britannicus. Dale corresponded and exchanged insects with many collectors and no doubt this rarity was much in demand, but as far as I am aware no other specimens of ssp gorganus collected by Dale at Glanvilles Wootton are extant in any collection. Another possibility is that his collection was attacked at some stage by dermestids. Dale first went to the fens of Whittlesea Mere on the 16 June 1814 and found P. machaon britannicus in plenty at Stilton Fen, taking 28 specimens, many at the plants of Ragged Robin Lychnis flos-cuculi growing on the banks of a dyke. Dale arrived at the dyke in a boat from the village of Holme. Today P. machaon gorganus is a very rare immigrant to Britain and P. machaon britannicus is confined to the Norfolk Broads.\n\nThe last specimen of Papilio machaon gorganus taken by J.C. Dale at Glanvilles Wootton on Newlands Common, the 15 August 1815. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nArgynnis paphia Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nThis large woodland butterfly was first taken at Glanville's Wootton on the 18 July 1808, where it was fairly common and at Enborne Copse on the 8 July 1809. Dale took a specimen of the dark female form valesina at Penwood, south of Enborne, Hampshire on the 21 July 1809. A widespread species in southern England and the Midlands, in recent years it has increased its range northwards. It is found in Wales but is absent from the far north of the country.\n\nArgynnis paphia. Male underside specimen from Midddlemarsh Woods. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nFavonius quercus Linnaeus, 1758. Lycaenidae.\n\nThe canopy specialist Favonius quercus is often seen around the tops of oak trees. Dale's first specimens was captured on the 27 July 1808 at Glanvilles Wootton where it was common and at Enborne on the 8 July 1809. Dale placed this species in the genus Thecla which at that time included all the British hairstreak butterflies. This species is widespread in England and Wales, with fewer colonies further north.\n\nFavonius quercus female. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nColias croceus Geoffroy, 1785. Pieridae.\n\nDale took his first specimen of this immigrant butterfly on the 30 July 1808 at Glanvilles Wootton and other specimens there between August and October. He also found it again at there in 1811, 1813, 1818, 1859 and 1862. A specimen of the female form helice was captured at Glanvilles Wootton on the 16 August 1834. Dale and other entomologists of this period referred to this butterfly as the Colias edusa of Fabricius, 1787.\n\nColias croceus female. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nLimenitis camilla Linnaeus, 1764. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale first saw this splendid woodland butterfly near Newbury, Berkshire on the 23 July 1808 and he captured it in Enborne Copse that year from the 12 to the 14 August. In 1809 he captured L. camilla in Enborne Copse from the 11 to the 13 August and again there on the 24 July 1810. The butterfly did not occur at Glanvilles Wootton. Today, this is a local butterfly being found in southern and central England with a few colonies in Wales.\n\nLimenitis camilla taken by Dale at Enborne between 1808 & 1810. Dale coll. OUMNH.\n\nArgynnis aglaja Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nThis butterfly was first captured by Dale at Newbury near Enborne on the 12 August 1808 and again at Enborne on the 27 July 1809. It was surprisingly rare at Glanvilles Wootton, only two were taken there, one at Newlands Common on the 11 August 1809 and in that locality on the 30 July 1814. It was also found in the Middlemarsh Woods to the south in the parish of Minterne Magna. The butterfly is widespread in Britain but it is scattered in the east.\n\nArgynnis aglaja. Middlemarsh Woods. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nPolyommatus coridon Poda, 1761. Lycaenidae.\n\nThis butterfly did not occur at Glanvilles Wootton because there was no suitable habitat there. Dale visited Puddle Hinton Down (Piddlehinton) in Dorset on the 7 August 1808 to take this species. Dale often travelled to localities to collect butterflies by horseback, this being a 20 mile (32 kilometers) around journey.\n\nThecla betulae Linnaeus, 1758. Lycaenidae.\n\nDale first captured this rather elusive butterfly on the 20 August 1808 at Newbury, two miles west of Enborne and at Glanvilles Wootton on the 11 August 1809, taking two further specimens there that year but only two others in subsequent years, on the 30 September 1815 and then not until many years later on the 4 August 1842. The butterfly is found in a few scattered localities in England and Wales.\n\nThecla betulae female underside specimen. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nEuphydryas aurinia Rottemburg, 1775. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale referred to this butterfly as the Melitaea artemis of Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775 a synonym of Euphydryas aurinia Rottemburg, 1775. He first captured this butterfly on the 27 May 1809 at Enborne Copse and wrote in pencil alongside the entry, \" the only one I saw there\". He took it there again on the 5 June 1810 and 16 June 1810, the latter being a red letter day for Dale because he captured an extreme aberration of this species that was recorded in his journal and by C.W. Dale (1878). Dale records that he took another similar aberration of E. aurinia at Enborne that he gave to the British Museum. The butterfly was only captured a few times at Glanvilles Wootton, at Newland Common on the 12 June 1815, Wootton Wood, 25 May 1832, Mullett's Copse, 29 May 1833 and again there the 28 May 1841. An uncommon and protected butterfly today that is extinct in some counties in southern England, being lost from most of its woodland habitats. The remaining scattered colonies in this region are now mainly on chalk downland, which the butterfly colonized when its former habitat changed or was lost. It is still found on moorland and wetland sites in south-west England, south Wales, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nAn extreme aberration of Euphydryas aurinia captured by Dale at Enborne on the 16 June 1810. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nEuphydryas aurinia underside specimen from Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nCupido minimus Fuessly, 1775. Lycaenidae.\n\nThe smallest British butterfly was recorded by Dale as the synonym Lycaena alsus Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775. Dale did not take this species at Enborne but he did capture it while at school there at Netherton in Hampshire, 8 miles to the south on the 11 June 1809. It was not taken at Glanvilles Wootton until the 17 June 1874, when C.W. Dale captured a single specimen. It is widespread but local butterfly in Britain\n\nArgynnis adippe Denis & Schiffermüller, 1775. Nymphalidae.\n\nArgynnis adippe was first captured by Dale at Enborne on the 27 July 1809. It was strangely absent from the woods of Glanvilles Wootton and Middlemarsh. Once widespread in England and Wales, it is now one of the rarest of British butterflies that was badly affected by the changes in woodland management. It is even absent from the New Forest, Hampshire, which was once a stronghold of this species, and where many extreme aberrations were taken. Today it is confined to a few colonies in Devon, one in South Wales and to the limestone District in north-west England, where the largest populations are found.\n\nLeptidea sinapis Linnaeus, 1758. Pieridae.\n\nThis charming and dainty woodland species was first taken by Dale at Enborne on the 30 April 1810 and at Glanvilles Wootton, a specimen of a second brood on the 29 July 1810. Dale places this species in his journal in the genus Pontia. C.W. Dale (1878) recorded that the butterfly was frequent in woods and gardens at Glanvilles Wootton. The butterfly has much declined in the UK and has been lost from many counties, due to changes in its woodland habitat\n\nLeptidea sinapis. 1. Male of the first brood captured in May. 2. Male of the second brood taken in July. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nApatura Iris Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale like many other young collectors was very keen to capture the most prized of the British butterflies. In his diary he records that a Mr Webb took a specimen at Brinsop Copse near Hereford on the 12 August 1808 and that Edward Shaw found the wings of this butterfly at a small wood under Coombe Hill, West Woodhay in Hampshire on the 2 August 1809. Dale made his first capture of a male A. iris at Enborne Copse on the 15 July 1810. Keen to take further specimens he waited beneath the oaks in Enborne Copse, although he saw males there on the 19, 20 & 23 July of that year, but the butterflies did not descend from the canopy. He had another tantalizing view there on 4 August 1811 of a male as it flew high among the oaks. Dale stayed at Enborne in the July of 1815, and had much good fortune in capturing A. iris. On the 1 July 1815 in Enborne Copse he caught a male flying along a ride, and then on the 8 July 1815 he took a male there visiting damp ground. He took his first female visiting the foodplant goat willow Salix caprea in Enborne Copse on the 17 July 1815 and another there the 25 July. He finished off his Purple Emperor season that year by taking a male at Enborne Copse on the 26 July and two at the nearby Redhill Copse on the 28 July 1815. The butterfly was absent from the woods at Glanvilles Wootton.\n\nApatura iris male. Enborne, Berkshire. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nApatura iris female. Enborne, July 1815.

Nymphalidae.\n\nThis butterfly was absent from Enborne. It was rare at Glanvilles Wootton, Dale taking there at Newlands Common on the 12 September 1812, the 5 September 1813 and at Sandhills Copse on the 22 & 29 August 1814, and there again on the the 12 August 1828. A few other specimens were taken at Glanvilles Wootton by his sons, C. W. & E. Dale. A local species, there are scattered colonies throughout Britain in ehere suitable habitat remains.\n\nHipparchia semele. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nPararge aegeria tircis Godart 1821. Nymphalidae.\n\nThe first entry in Dale's Journal of this species, which he placed in the genus Hipparchia was at Glanvilles Wootton on the 11 June 1813, where it was abundant in shady places. Still a common butterfly with a widespread distribution in Britain.\n\nLasiommata megera Linnaeus, 1767. Nymphalidae.\n\nDale first record of Lasiommata megera was at Glanvilles Wootton on the 11 June 1813, where it was common on banks. Surprisingly he did not record the butterfly from Enborne. There has been a widespread decline of this species in inland areas of Britain and it is now most often seen in coastal regions.\n\nLasiommata megera male. Glanvilles Wootton. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nManiola jurtina Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nThe first entry in his Journal for this butterfly is the 16 June 1813 at Glanvilles Wootton. Certainly Dale would have previously seen this common widespread species both at Enborne and Glanvilles Wootton. C.W. Dale took aberrations of this species at Glanvilles Wootton in 1864.\n\nManiola jurtina extreme aberration. Glanvilles Wootton, June 1864, C.W. Dale. Dale coll. OUMNH.\n\nManiola jurtina aberration.

Lycaenidae.\n\nThis beautiful species did not occur at Glanvilles Wootton but is included here because it was first taken in Dorset by Dale on the 6 June 1815 at Puddle Hinton (Piddlehinton) Down. It seems to have been rare there during his visit, he only captured a pair of specimens. A local species of the chalk hills of Southern England.\n\nLysandra bellargus male. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nAporia crataegi. Linnaeus, 1758. Pieridae.\n\nC.W. Dale records that Aporia crataegi was very rare at Glanvilles Wootton, and taken by his father on the 11 June 1813, 2 July 1814 and in Sandhills Copse the 10 June 1815. However, there is a specimen in the Dale collection with Glanvilles Wootton, May 1808 placed at its side. In J. C. Dale's copy of George Samouelle's Entomologist's Useful Compendium there is a note, under A. crataegi \" I have bred it at Enborne from very young larvae found in March in apple\", there is a possibility that the specimen labelled May 1908, is in fact a specimen bred from larvae collected by Dale at Enborne and that it perhaps emerged at Glanvilles Wootton. Always local and rare, this species has long been extinct in Britain.\n\nAporia crataegi. 1. Underside specimen Sandhills Copse, Glanvilles Wootton, 10 June 1815. 2.

Dale (1878) who referred to this species as the Hesperia linea of Fabricius, recorded it was common at Glanvilles Wootton, as it was no doubt at Enborne. A widespread species in Britain but absent from Scotland.\n\nAglais urticae Linnaeus, 1758. Nymphalidae.\n\nA widespread species that was recorded as being common at Glanvilles Wootton by C.W.

Dale at Glanvilles Wootton in 1868. Dale coll, OUMNH.\n\nSome Moths captured by J.C. Dale at Enborne and Glanvilles Wootton between 1808 & 1815.\n\nDale's entomological journals also contains his first captures of moths, which he was also very keen to collect and study. His early captures represent species that he found flying by day or at rest, or perhaps flying at dusk in the garden. Nocturnal collecting with light and sugar were of the future and many moths that later could be attracted in numbers by those methods were regarded by early entomologists as rarities, the general distribution being unknown at that date. Certainly very common species might be omitted from his journals. Each new capture would bring the excitement of discovery and in a number of cases information regarding its habits, so different today when anyone can run a moth trap and attract large numbers of moths without any real effort or knowledge on the collectors part. Dale certainly must have been aware that moths were attracted to light, as occasionally they flew through windows to visit the candles that lighted the rooms, in the first part of the 19th century.\n\nWhat is noticeable from Dale's impressive Lepdoptera notes is how rich the countryside around Enborne and Glanville Wootton was in the early part of the 19th century. Woodland during this period would have been coppiced with sunny rides and clearings that had many wild flowers, nectar sources for many Lepidoptera. There would have been plenty of unimproved meadows for Dale to spend many happy hours collecting in.\n\nRheumaptera hastata Linnaeus, 1758 (Argent & Sable) Geometridae » Larentiinae.\n\nThe first entry in Dale's diary of a moth is that of the striking day-flying Phalaena hastata that he found on an oak on the 4 June 1808 at Enborne. He took it again in that locality on the 18 May 1809, and the 4 & 10 June 1809. He noted that this species was frequent in Enborne Copse. It was not recorded at Glanvilles Wootton.\n\nArctia villica Linnaeus, 1758. (Cream- spot Tiger) Erebidae » Arctiinae.\n\nDale first capture of this beautiful moth was at Sherborne in Dorset on the 29 June 1808. Sherborne is a small market town about eight miles north Glanvilles Wootton. He caught specimens at Enborne on the 4 & 10 June 1809. He bred a series from larvae collected at Enborne on the 5 May 1810. C.W. Dale recorded it as of only an occasional occurence at Glanvilles Wootton. Today this species is usually coastal, being now rare or absent in many inland areas.\n\nCallimorpha dominula Linnaeus, 1758. (Scarlet Tiger) Erebidae » Arctiinae.\n\nIt is clear that Dale's early captures of moths were during the day, while he was out collecting butterflies. He first captured this beautiful moth on the 1 July 1808 at Glanvilles Wootton and again there the 1 August 1808 and at Enborne on the 13 July 1809.\n\nLasiocampa quercus Linnaeus, 1758. (Oak Eggar) Lasiocampidae.\n\nThe males of this large moth fly by day, the females being nocturnal. At this period this species was placed in the genus Bombyx. Dale took his first specimen at Glanvilles Wootton on the 2 July 1808, where it was common in the larva state.\n\nLasiocampa quercus male. Glanvilles Wootton.

(Red Underwing) Erebidae.\n\nThis very fine moth was taken at rest on a barn at Enborne on the 20 August 1808 and again in that locality the 2, 15 & 17 September and in October of that year.
