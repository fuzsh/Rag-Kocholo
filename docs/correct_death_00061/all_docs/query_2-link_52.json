        "text": "Common buckeye ~ Junonia coenia\n\nDecades ago, while still living in Big Ten football country, I knew Buckeyes only as the team associated with Ohio State. Years later, I met the confection known as buckeyes: a peanut butter and chocolate candy resembling the nut of the buckeye tree, with a shiny, dark brown exterior and light brown ‘eye.’\n\nNow, decades later, I’ve come to enjoy a different, fluttering buckeye: a brush-footed butterfly with about a two-inch wingspan. Part of a family named for short front legs that end in little brushes of hairs used for smelling and tasting rather than for walking or standing, the Common Buckeye can be found across the southern United States and Mexico; each year it temporarily moves northward to colonize much of the United States.\n\nThe butterfly itself is common and easily recognizable, but when I discovered at least two dozen caterpillars happily feeding at the Solo Tract in east Texas, I didn’t realize they were buckeye larvae. Fond of a variety of plants including snapdragons, stonecrop, toadflax, and verbenas, these caterpillars were making short work of plants known as prairie agalinis or prairie false foxglove: Agalinis heterophylla.\n\nBuckeye caterpillar resting in the sun\n\nBeautifully colored, with a black background, rows of orange and cream spots, orange prolegs on abdominal segments and black branched spines with blue bases, the mature larva is quite a striking creature: right down to its cute orange head.\n\nIt’s also an enthusiastic feeder. Each of these caterpillars made short work of the leaf it was grasping; leafless stems made clear where the creatures already had passed by.\n\nAren’t those little legs cute?\n\nIt seems that buckeyes find agalinis flowers as tasty as the stems and leaves.\n\nPerhaps the flowers are sweeter, like dessert\n\nAdult buckeyes frequent open areas, making short flights between stops. They often rest on the ground, with wings opened while basking. In dappled light, their colors help with camouflage, but their large eyespots are hard to miss; these buckeyes certainly qualify as a natural form of eye candy.\n\nComments always are welcome.\n\nMaryland meadow beauty ~ Rhexia mariana\n\nDepending on the source you prefer, nine to thirteen Rhexia species are considered to be part of the Melastomeaceae, one of the largest families of neotropical woody plants. Four of those species, known as meadow beauties, can be found in east Texas, particularly in sandy wetlands, seeps, or wet pine savannas. On the other hand, they also can be found on wet prairies; I’ve found them blooming along a meander at Nash Prairie and on the prairie at Brazos Bend State Park.\n\nThe genus name Rhexia, derived from the Greek rhexis, or rupture, alludes to the reputed curative nature of the plant. Many specific epithets refer to the plants’ color or location; Maryland meadow beauty, for example, is known as mariana.\n\nAll meadow beauty flowers are notable for large and complex anthers. Most plants’ anthers appear yellow because of the pollen they bear, but the yellow of Rhexia anthers is caused by pigment; their pollen is contained within the hollow anthers. Holes at their tips allow visiting bees to shake pollen out by vibrating their wings while clinging to the anther; as much as ninety per cent of Rhexia pollination is carried out by species of bumblebees capable of this ‘buzz pollination.’\n\nRhexia mariana can be distinguished from R. virginica, the only other member of the genus found as far north as New England, by narrower leaves, rounder stems, and non-tuberous roots.\n\nYellow Meadow-beauty ~ Rhexia lutea\n\nOften associated with longleaf pine, yellow meadow-beauty is the only yellow-flowered Rhexia, which might suggest easy identification. On the other hand, it can resemble certain Oenothera species. Because Rhexia lutea blooms with a richer, more golden-yellow than primroses, color can help to distinguish them. The shape of the stigma also is a key. Flowers in Oenothera possess a cross-shaped stigma, while Rhexia stigmas are round.\n\nWhen the flower no longer is blooming, the hypanthium — a combination of the receptacle and the bases of the sepals, petals, and stamens fused together into a single unit — is distinctly urn-shaped: a detail that Thoreau noted in his writings.\n\nFringed meadow-beauty ~ Rhexia petiolata\n\nSometimes confused with Nuttall’s meadow beauty (R. nuttallii), fringed meadow-beauty (R. petiolata) has no hairs on the outside of its round, urn-shaped seed capsules, while Nuttall’s capsules are covered by conspicuous hairs. One of the smooth capsules is visible near the flower in the photo above.\n\nVirginia meadow-beauty ~ Rhexia virginica\n\nBecause I failed to capture the stamens of this plant, I wasn’t certain of its identity until I read that Virginia meadow-beauty is characterized by bright green, oval to egg-shaped opposite leaves with bristles along their edges. The color of the opening flower, the leaves, and the presence of the plant in a wet location filled with mosses and other moisture-loving species certainly suggests a meadow-beauty, but if it isn’t? It’s a beauty nonetheless.\n\nComments always are welcome.\n\nA quarter-sized sundew sporting an unusually shaped stem\n\nIn some ways, March was a quiet month at the Big Thicket’s Solo tract. A few white violets lingered, a variety of shrubs had begun putting on new growth, and the first hints of summer-blooming flowers had appeared, but signs of spring were less obvious than on the wildflower-strewn prairies.\n\nThat said, beneath towering loblolly and longleaf pines another sort of natural delight was thriving: the diminuitive sundew. Not as well known as the Venus Flytrap found primarily in North and South Carolina, four of the five genera of North American carnivorous plants can be found in Texas: pitcher plants (Saracenia spp.), butterworts (Penquicula spp.), bladderworts (Utricularia spp.), and sundews (Drosera spp.).\n\nSundews often appear in conjunction with other carnivorous plants — especially pitcher plants — in the wet pinelands, savannas, and bogs of east Texas, but in March, the Solo Tract was sundew heaven.\n\nThe service road leading into the Solo Tract, with its sandy soil and wet ditches, was edged with a multitude of plants. Two sundew species call east Texas home — the green spoon-leaf sundew (Drosera intermedia) and the pink sundew (D. capillaris) — but at the Solo tract, the pink sundew reigns supreme.\n\nWere it not for their color, their small size sometimes makes them difficult to spot; the plants’ diameter ranges from a half-inch to three inches, while the flower is about a half-inch across. The slender stems, holding the flower three to four inches above the plant, are remarkably delicate and threadlike.\n\nInitially, the green cast of some sundews fooled me into thinking I’d found the spoon-leaf species. In fact, pink sundews tend toward green on days with limited light, but become pink or red in bright sunlight.\n\nA shaded pink sundew tending toward green\n\nMore sunlight means a turn toward pink…\n\nand even brighter color\n\nCarnivorous plants tend to live in soils lacking in nitrogen and phosphorus: nutrients leached from the soil by the water surrounding them. In order to thrive, they absorb those nutrients from the insects they trap, utilizing them as aids to photosynthesis.\n\nSundews which absorb high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous, whether through the soil or by capturing prey, are more vigorous, and tend to set more flowers and seeds. Judging by the number of buds and flowers among the Solo Tract’s sundews, they were very healthy indeed.\n\nTiny sundew buds\n\nSundews typically bloom in spring. Their pink or occasionally white flowers open on sunny mornings and close by afternoon. Long stems holding the flowers well above the sundew on the ground serve a practical purpose: they help potential pollinators avoid being trapped by the insect-hungry plant.\n\nSince carnivorous plants can’t uproot themselves to pursue their dinner, they developed other means of surviving, and the sundew’s way is especially interesting.\n\nEach of their leaves is covered with tentacles which secrete the dew-like, sticky droplets of fluid which gave the plant its name. When an insect attracted to the plant becomes stuck, the plant encloses it with its tentacles; in a relatively short time, the plant’s digestive enzymes and acids dissolve the body of the victim, and the nutrients are absorbed by special glands.\n\nThese so-called ‘sticky traps’ take various forms, but they appear in all species of Drosera, and they’re immensely effective. The more the insect struggles, the more stickiness it encounters, and the less likely escape becomes.\n\nA captured ant\n\nAn unfortunate spider on the right\n\nDew-bee, dew-bee, dew…\n\nRemarkably, Drosera doesn’t depend solely on its stickiness to ensure it dines well. All species of sundew are capable of moving their tentacles in response to insects that happen by; the hairs and leaves of the plant bend toward the captive prey, bringing the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Charles Darwin, the contact of the legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to induce this response, known as thigmotropism: the turning or bending of a plant in response to a touch stimulus.\n\nNow that I’ve learned about the phenomenon, it seems likely that I captured images of it at least twice.\n\nAt the bottom of the frame, tentacles bending around an insect\n\nAn especially pretty, bright red example of thigmotropism\n\nSundews became the favorite plants of naturalist Charles Darwin; he called them ‘insectivorous’ rather than ‘carnivorous.’ In his correspondence with Asa Gray, both his interest in the plants and his affection for them is made clear:\n\nDuring the summer of 1860, I was surprised by finding how large a number of insects were caught by the leaves of the common sun-dew [sic]… I had heard that insects were thus caught but knew nothing further on the subject.\n\nI have been infinitely amused by working at Drosera: the movements are really curious, & the manner in which the leaves detect certain nitrogenous compounds is marvellous.\n\nI care more for Drosera than the origin of species … it is a wonderful plant, or rather a most sagacious animal. I will stick up for Drosera to the day of my death.\n\nWere he with us today, Darwin no doubt would be fascinated by modern explorations of convergent evolution among carnivorous plants. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that carnivorous plants evolved independently six or more times within five separate orders. Most are only distantly related to one another; they evolved in a variety of geographical regions from unrelated organisms of origin.\n\nI suspect he’d be equally intrigued by the fact that his work with the insectivores has been memorialized in a song.\n\nMost of Darwin’s experimental work was on Drosera; the first twelve chapters of his book Insectivorous Plants, published in 1875, is filled with the results of his experiments and his own drawings of the plants which fascinated him. Darwin worried that the book would be poorly received, but others clearly shared his fascination with the plants’ behaviors. A first printing sold 1,700 copies; second, third, and four printings soon followed.\n\nDarwin’s neighbour Ellen Lubbock celebrated the publication with a poem written from the insects’ point of view: a clever bit of anthropomorphizing that still appeals today.\n\nWe saw that you were watching us,\n\nWe felt you were our friend,\n\nAnd as we, in a general way,\n\nCome to a fearful end,\n\nIt suddenly occurred to us\n\nThat we would have a look\n\nAt what you said about us,\n\nSo we crawled upon your book.\n\nWe now have buzzed all over it,\n\nAnd find that, as we feared,\n\nVoracious Plants could tell us\n\nHow our friends have disappeared.\n\nComments always are welcome.\n\nLongleaf pine ~ Pinus palustris\n\nThe centerpiece of the Solo Tract in east Texas’s Big Thicket is the longleaf pine. Beginning life as a grass-like bundle capable of protecting the young tree from fire, the tree dedicates its first years to below-ground root growth; during this stage, the tree sometimes is confused with bunch grasses like little bluestem.\n\nA young longleaf pine\n\nEventually the trees begin to grow, entering what’s known as the ‘bottle brush’ stage: a period when the tree is most vulnerable to fire. The tree shown in today’s first photo is beginning to move out of that phase, adding needle-trimmed branches to the ‘bottle brush’ on top; eventually, development of its thick, fire resistant bark will increase its ability to withstand both natural and prescribed burns.\n\nLongleaf pine bark showing the effects of fire\n\nMature trees produce two types of cones: pollen-bearing male cones and seed-bearing female cones. Both are produced in summer, grow slowly over the fall and winter, and then become active the following spring. In January, I found these purple male cones still closed.\n\nBy February, male cones littered the ground, having released their pollen to fertilize the female cones. After approximately a year and a half, the female cones mature and release their seeds into the wind. Seeds that find open, sunny patches of ground germinate; those unable to penetrate dense leaf litter may not. Using periodic, low intensity fire helps to keep longleaf forests open by burning off shade-producing plants and litter that inhibit germination; the ash which results also provides valuable soil nutrients.\n\nAn older female cone and this year’s purple male cones\n\nDespite their small size, even the male cones open in a way we think of as typically pine cone-ish.\n\nCloseup of an opened male cone\n\nAmong the trees and cones, basal leaves of Aletris aurea, the golden colic-root, begin to grow in early spring. Once considered a member of the lily family, the plant has been moved into the bog asphodel family (Nartheciaceae), although most sources still place it in the Liliaceae. The genus name Aletris refers to a female slave from Greek mythology. Her task was to grind grain into meal; the rough texture of colic-root flowers resembles ground meal.\n\nEmerging leaves of the golden colic-root\n\nIn January, only dried seed pods remained, but in a few weeks long spikes of golden-yellow flowers would appear; aurea is Latin for ‘golden,’ and the source of the plant’s common name.\n\nGolden colic-root seed pods\n\nGiven their preference for wet pine flatwoods, bogs, and seeps, it wasn’t entirely surprising to find this colic-root nestled next to another lover of wet environments: the pink sundew.\n\nColic-root and a pink sundew (Drosera capillaris)\n\nFour of five North American carnivorous plants can be found in Texas: pitcher plants, sundews, butterworts, and bladderworts. Only the Venus flytrap is missing; it’s native range is limited to North Carolina, coastal South Carolina, and two counties in Florida.\n\nTwo sundew species populate East Texas: the green spoon-leaf sundew (Drosera intermedia) and the pink sundew. I’ve yet to find the spoon-leaf, but there was no missing the pink.\n\nA dime-sized pink sundew\n\nSundews possess special glands which secrete droplets of sticky fluid, giving the plant its glistening appearance. Insects attracted to the plant by the drops’ nectar-like appearance and scent quickly become stuck. Once the plant senses a struggling insect, it wraps around it, allowing digestive enzymes to transform the insect into usable nutrients.\n\nAlthough most pink sundews are quite small, lying flat to the ground, this little bundle of stickiness was either a number of plants clustered together, or some sort of genetic anomaly.\n\nA pretty pile of pink\n\nWhat’s certain is the fate of the little winged insect lying near the top of the pile.\n\nLike a moth too close to a flame\n\nThis differently colored sundew also is D. capillaris. In bright sunlight the plant appears red; in lesser light, the leaves may be green with red tentacles. Sundews also produce tiny flowers, although none had bloomed in February.\n\nAt the time of my first February visit, significant rains had left many sundews buried in sand, and small piles of sand smoothed by rushing water were everywhere. The holes in the centers of the piles suggested burrowing creatures — like crawfish — were responsible.\n\nLater that month, my suspicion was confirmed. I’d never seen a crawfish chimney built of sand, but whichever species calls the Solo tract home, it knows its business.\n\nA crawfish’s sand castle\n\nNearby, what I believe to be a rusty gilled polypore (Gloeophyllum sepiarium) decorated a stump. A wood decay fungus, G. sepiarium grows on dead conifers; its brown cap is loosely fan-shaped, with the sort of yellow-orange margin shown here.\n\nThe day held two more surprises. First came an abundance of the bog white violets highlighted in my previous post.\n\nBog white violet ~ Viola lanceolata\n\nThe species name lanceolata refers to the violets’ spear-shaped leaves, which can be as much as six inches long.\n\nA host plant for fritillary larvae, the violets attract an assortment of butterflies and bees. On this day, I found what I believe to be a Juvenal’s duskywing visiting one of the flowers.\n\nCurious about the name, I learned that a collection of duskywings — Juvenal’s, Horace’s, Mottled (E. martialis), Columbine (E. lucilius), and Persius (E. persius) — are named for Roman poets. The convention was begun by Johan Christian Fabricius, a Danish zoologist who specialized in insects. A student of Carl Linnaeus, he established the basis for modern insect classification.\n\nJuvenal’s duskywing ~ Erynnis juvenalis\n\nEven ants like violets. Fourteen species of carpenter ants occur in Texas; the largest, the black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus), is found primarily in wooded outdoor areas. Whatever its species, this ant spent a considerable amount of time on the flower: perhaps lapping up nectar left by a previous visitor.\n\nBlack carpenter ant ~ Camponotus spp.\n\nThe other surprise was finding native blueberries among the dewberries. Blueberries are grown in Texas, but I wasn’t aware that a native species exists in a handful of eastern counties. The flowers were both beautiful and plentiful; if I’m lucky, in coming weeks I’ll find at least a few berries before the birds get to them.\n\nElliott’s blueberry ~ Vaccinium elliottii\n\nComments always are welcome.\n\nFor an introduction to this “Going Solo” series, please click here."
