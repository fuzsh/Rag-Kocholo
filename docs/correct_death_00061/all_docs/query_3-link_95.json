        "text": "Goethe: A bipolar personality? Periodicity of affective states in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as reflected by Paul Julius MÃ¶bius.\n\nPubMed\n\nSteinberg, Holger; SchÃ¶nknecht, Peter\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper aims to investigate the character and etiological basis of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's mental disorder. From 1898, German neuropsychiatrist Paul Julius MÃ¶bius developed the hypothesis that Goethe's work provided several hints for the notion that the German poet suffered from a distinct bipolar disorder. The paper investigates MÃ¶bius's psychopathographic study on Goethe and his hypothesis of a mood periodicity in Goethe against the mirror of modern concepts. MÃ¶bius came to the conclusion that Goethe's illness was bipolar in character and became visible at intervals of seven years and lasted for about two years. The majority of MÃ¶bius's contemporary psychiatric colleagues (Emil Kraepelin, Max Isserlin, Ernst Kretschmer, Josef Breuer) supported this view which has still not been convincingly challenged. In present-day terms, MÃ¶bius's hypothesis can be best mirrored as a subclinical foundation of mood disorder. Furthermore, with his extensive study, MÃ¶bius disproved the common notion that Goethe had suffered from an illness as the result of a syphilitic infection.\n\n[\"I am rather satisfied with this interpretation of my dreams.\" -- real-life and work-related encounters between psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmideler, S; Steinberg, H\n\n2004-09-01\n\nApart from being a major pioneer of modern psychiatry, Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773 - 1843) is foremost famous as the first academic teacher, professor of this subject at Leipzig University. Despite his theoretical concepts being thoroughly investigated by medical historians, the fact that his scientific work also brought him in contact with Weimar poet and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 - 1832) has up to now not been acknowledged. This paper analyses for the first time the manifold points of contact between the two geniuses. Starting off with a retrospective on Goethe's relationship towards psychiatry in his day, this paper investigates the mutual interconnections and influences between the two. This is achieved by an analysis of yet unknown primary sources as well as Goethe's literary and scientific works. A main emphasis is also placed on Heinroth's Textbook of Anthropology of 1822 in which the psychiatrist laid out his understanding of 'relational thinking' (gegenstÃ¤ndliches Denken), a key concept for both. This theory developed from Heinroth's dealing with Goethe's concept of \"anschauung\" and was to gain major importance not only for his way of gaining knowledge in general but also for his psychiatric concept. Goethe's influence on Heinroth is particularly revealed in the latter's holistic views on mental illnesses. Heinroth's visit to Goethe on 15 September 1827 can be earmarked as a sign of their mutual esteem.\n\nMelting experiments and field work on KomornÃ­ HÃ¹rka volcano, Bohemia, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHorn, Susanne; Kreher-Hartmann, Birgit; Heide, K.\n\n2001-09-01\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), eminent author, was also state minister and scientist as well as experimentalist in geology. Together with DÃ¶bereiner, a chemist in Jena during that time, he carried out melting experiments in porcelain and pottery kilns with rocks and minerals from the volcanic and pseudo-volcanic edifices in NW Bohemia. These experiments were to prove Goethe's theory, that remelting of an archetype rock would result in volcanic and pseudo-volcanic rocks. Especially the formation of the KomornÃ­ HÃ¹rka (Kammerberg) volcano in NW Bohemia attracted Goethe during all his life. He visited this location 19 times in 1808, 1820 and 1822 and made very exact field observations. But the interpretation of these observations varied between volcanistic and neptunistic. In order to find arguments, he examined the effect of fire on rocks and minerals using porcelain and pottery kilns. The experiments did not provide the expected results and thus failed to explain the formation of KomornÃ­ HÃ¹rka. During Goethe's geognostic work, including the \"pyro-technical\" experiments, the neptunism-volcanism-controversy about the formation of basalt raged in Europe, and, more general, about rock formation: neptunism-plutonism. Especially the effect of heat on rocks and minerals, i.e. the phenomenology of fire, played an important role in that discussion. Goethe swayed during his lifetime between neptunism and volcanism. He did not fully accept plutonism because he believed, that processes of nature are generally non-violent and that volcanic eruptions and other catastrophic phenomena are the exception rather than the rule. Therefore he tended to neptunistic ideas. In Goethe's notes there are many indications of this conflict. In contrast, the melting experiments are mentioned only few times. It was, however, possible to establish a picture of his experimental work and his fundamental concepts and ideas.\n\nGoethe and the Aurora\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchrÃ¶der, Wilfried\n\n2008-05-01\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) was deeply interested in many aspects of natural science, including geology and meteorology.

However, his engagement went far beyond literature especially relating to politics and natural science. Goethe, primarily trained as a lawyer, developed his own theory of colors and even challenged the concepts of Isaac Newton. His discovery of the human intermaxilary bone questioned all the dogmas of the religious-minded world of the 18th century. Together with the anatomy professor Justus Christian Loder, Goethe performed comparative anatomy and proved the conceptual uniformity of humans and animals on 27 March 1784. Even though, FÃ©lix Vicq d'Azyr described the intermaxilary bone simultaneously in Catholic France, Goethe's findings were politically accepted due to the liberal Protestantism of the Duchy of Weimar. Nevertheless, leading anatomists of the century (Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Petrus Camper and Samuel Thomas v. Soemmerring) mainly rejected Goethe's postulates which led to a delayed publication in 1820; almost 36 years after writing his original manuscript. Today, Goethe's discovery is known to be a fundamental basis for the development of Charles Darwin's theory of phylogenetic evolution. Nowadays, the Department of Anatomy contains the Museum Anatomicum Jenense which was founded by the Duke of Weimar, Carl August and Goethe and entails Goethe's premaxillary bones as its main attraction. The University values the cultural heritage of Goethe's contribution to Medicine and provides access to the collection to the public and generations of medical students. Still today Goethe's legacy is noticeable in the halls of the Alma Mater Jenensis.

In this article, we offer a reading of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's scientific writingsâparticularly his works on color as an exquisite articulation of his ideas about experimentationâthrough the lens of practical school science. While avoiding the hasty conclusions made from isolated experiments and observations, Goethe sought in his experiments the interconnection among diverse natural phenomena and rejected the dualistic epistemology about the relation of humans and nature. Based on a close examination of his color theory and its underlying epistemology, we suggest three potential contributions that Goethe's conception of scientific experimentation can make to practical work in school science.\n\nHow We Can Win the Long War: A New Interagency Approach to the GWOT\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-04-01\n\nJohann Wolfgang Von Goethe states, âBoldness has genius, power, and magic in it.

Goethe - poet engaged in Earth sciences\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNemec, Vaclav\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe famous German poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749 - 1832) was a man of an outstanding interest for the Earth sciences. In the Czech geological dictionary his own biography remembers his frequent visits to the famous West Bohemian health resorts. In this region he was focusing his attention to the geological history, petrography and mineralogy, genesis of mineral water springs etc. Some of his studies were published. His geological points of view were not always correct (as seen from a recent knowledge) but his efforts to deepen studies of this territory cannot be forgotten. - In his rich correspondence with the count Kaspar Maria Sternberg (1761 - 1838) - founder of the (nowadays) National Museum in Prague - the author of this article has recently discovered in the Prague archives a letter written just one week before the death of the poet. It is a confession of his deep relation especially to the region if West Bohemia where he found lot of enjoyment and new knowledge in the course of numerous visits and stays. - Goethe had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe (17800 rock samples). A mineral goethite has been named after him. - The Czech composer VÃ¡clav Jan TomÃ¡Å¡ek (1774 - 1850) describing his visit paid to Goethe in Cheb (Eger) in 1822 remembers also mineralogical interest of the poet and his excursions to the region for collecting local minerals. The main reason for personal contact in this case was the art (TomÃ¡Å¡ek composed songs using Goethe's poems). But TomÃ¡Å¡ek described also his frequent talks on science with the famous Swedish chemist JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius (1779 - 1848) in Karlsbad (1822). From other sources a common stay of Berzelius, Goethe and Sternberg in Marienbad (also 1822) is reported.\n\nFederal Republic of Germany, A Country Study.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-02-01\n\npride.

It builds theories and frames hypotheses within those theories. Empirical theories are stated as plausible answers to questions we pose to nature. According to the Galilean-Baconian tradition within science, these questions should basically explore the causes of observed phenomena, and further be restricted to the measurable and quantitative realm. Thus, the answers are generally expected to explain the effective causes behind the actual phenomena. By framing falsifiable hypotheses, the theories are tested against the empirical foundation on which they rest. In this way we try to relieve science from false theories. Thus, we have two epistemological levels: First, the theoretical level; the scientific theory explaining the phenomena, and second, the empirical level; the phenomena or facts verifying or falsifying those theories. According to the poet and multi-scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), there is however another way of science, namely an approach where these two levels fuse and become one. Goethe intended this approach to be a complementation of the Galilean-Baconian method, more than an alternative. He considered his \"hypothesis-free method\" to be a more comprehensive and secure way to understand nature. Whereas the Galilean-Baconian method aimed at explaining the effective causes of natural phenomena, in order to control and exploit nature for technical and industrial purposes, Goethe aimed at an exposition of the inherent meaning of the phenomena.We will explore, exemplify and discuss this approach with reference to the inherently Goethean phenomenology of evolution credited to the Dutch anatomist Louis Bolk (1866-1930), later commented and complemented by Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) and Jos Verhulst (1949 ). In the course of this presentation we will outline the Goethean approach as a method representing a juvenilization or in Bolk's terms, a fetalization of science.\n\nGoethe's Italian Journey and the geological landscape\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCoratza, Paola; Panizza, Mario\n\n2015-04-01\n\nOver 220 years ago Johann Wolfgang von Goethe undertook a nearly two-years long and fascinating journey to Italy, a destination dreamed for a long time by the great German writer. During his journey from Alps to Sicily Goethe reflects on landscape, geology, morphology of \"Il Bel Paese\", sometimes providing detailed descriptions and acute observations concerning the great and enduring laws by which the earth and all within it are governed. He was an observer, with the eye of the geologist and landscape painter, as he himself stated, and therefore he had a 360 degree focus on all parts of the territory. From the Brenner Pass to Sicily, Goethe reflects on landscape, contrasting morphologies, the genesis of territories, providing detailed descriptions useful for reconstructing the conditions of the territory and crops of the late 18th century. His diary is a description of the impressions he received from the country and its people, mingled with reflections upon art, science and literature. Goethe studied mineralogical and geological phenomena and drew up notes on the life of the people, the climate and the plants. On various scientific occasions and, in particular, within the framework of the Italian Association \"Geologia & Turismo\", of the Working Group \"Geomorphosites\" of the International Association of Geomorphologists and the International Year of Planet Earth, the opportunity to re-examine Goethe's travels in Italy from a geological viewpoint was recognised. In the present paper an attempt was made to reproduce the geotourism itinerary ante litteram of the writer to Italy, one of the most important tourist destination worldwide, thanks to its rich cultural and natural heritage and the outstanding aesthetic qualities of the complex natural landscape. This project was essentially conceived with a twofold purpose. First of all, an attempt was made to reproduce the journey of a great writer, as an example of description of landscape perceived and described as\n\nGoethe almost died of urosepsis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGross, A J; Hummel, G\n\n1999-12-01\n\nIn the year of 1805, Goethe almost died of urosepsis. His urological problems were not diseases arising from full health but a new variation in a life accompanied by illnesses. Some sources date the first colics he experienced to the year 1795 and others say 1805. The most dramatic period in the course of his illness was in February, when he suffered from fever of such an extent that one could speak of urosepsis. Recovery took place slowly and was accompanied by minor relapses. Nothing about this is written down in his work. On the advice of his doctors, Goethe undertook a cure in LauchstÃ¤dt in July and August. The report of his consultant, Professor Johann Christian Reil, on his problems in the field of urology remained undiscovered until 1937. Professor Reil recommended treatment with thermae carolinae, aqua calcis, soap soda crystallisata, herbae subastringentes, and uva ursi, among other measures. With increasing age, Goethe's colics disappeared. The passing of a stone has never been described. Whereas Goethe hinted about medical problem other than those reported herein, the urological problems discussed in this article were left unmentioned. Nonetheless, literature that deals with Goethe's diseases is interesting from the aspect of both the history of medicine and the history of culture.\n\nUmgang mit Gedichten: Bemerkungen zu funf Gedichten von Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (Dealing with Poetry: Observations on Five Poems by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNethersole, Reingard\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe lyric poem is the most concentrated form of literary communication.

Some people seem young for their age, others seem old; shining examples of older individuals who maintained high levels of intellectual functioning well into very old age, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe or Sophocles, stand in contrast to individuals whose cognitive resources are depleted by the time they reach later adulthood. A similar contrast exists between different intellectual abilities. For example, if one looks at the speed needed to identify and discriminate between different percepts, one is likely to find monotonic decline after late adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nFAL Clowes, 1921-2016: a Memoir.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarlow, Peter W\n\n2018-03-04\n\nWith the death of Frederick Albert Lionel Clowes on 21 September 2016, plant sciences lost a member of that lineage of experimental morphologists which reaches back to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1949, he discovered a group of cells at the tip of the beech root apex which were metabolically inert. In 1954, he confirmed generality of this root apex feature and coined the term 'quiescent center'. He continued to study these unique cells throughout next decades up to his last papers published in 1980s. Concept of the quiescent centre of plant roots is one of the milestones in plant cell biology and plant physiology.\n\nFacts as Theory: Aspects of Goethe's Philosophy of Science.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZajonc, Arthur G.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nAfter showing that Goethe's declarations and admonishments concerning the scope and methods of science often foreshadowed later developments, the author reconsiders Goethe's own scientific efforts.

Goethe (1749-1832) proposed the concept of a hypothetical sessile organism known as the 'Plant Archetype,' which was subsequently reconstructed and depicted by 19th-century botanists, such as Franz Unger (1800-1870) and Julius Sachs (1832-1897), and can be considered one of the first expressions of Evo-Devo thinking. Here, we present the history of this concept in the context of Ernst Haeckel's (1834-1919) biogenetic law espoused in his Generelle Morphologie der Organismen of 1866. We show that Haeckel's idea of biological recapitulation may help to explain why various phenomena, such as the ontogenetic transformations in the stellar anatomy of lycopods and ferns, the transition from primary to secondary anatomy of seed plants, the presence of unfused juvenile cone scale segments in the Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), and the transition of C3- to C4-photosynthesis in the ontogeny of maize (Zea mays), appear to support his theories. In addition, we outline the current status of plant evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo), which can be traced back to Haeckel's (1866) biogenetic law, with a focus on the model plant thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana).\n\nWolfgang Kummer at CERN\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchopper, Herwig\n\nWolfgang Kummer was not only a great theorist but also a man with a noble spirit and extensive education, based on a fascinating long-term Austrian cultural tradition.

At the same time, with todayâs new communication possibilities the demand and expectations of effective medical treatment have been increased. This presentation will illustrate the need for the âindustrializationâ of healthcare in order to achieve highest results at limited budgets. Thereby, industrialization is not meaning the medical treatment based on the assembly line approach. Rather it is to recognize the cost of medical care as an investment with respective expectationsmoreÂ Â» on the return of the investment. Innovations in imaging and pharmaceutical products as well as in processes - that lead to similar medical results, but with lower efforts - are keys in such scenarios.

This article argues that the fear of suicidal contagion and the horror of vaccination, both of which raged in Britain in the long eighteenth century, were linked to ideas about sympathy and the importation of the Other into the Self. With reference to the psychoanalytic notions of extimitÃ© and Ã©trangerÃ©tÃ©; the eighteenth-century medical theories of William Rowley and Edward Jenner; the philosophy of \"sympathy,\" as adumbrated in the work of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume and Edmund Burke; and two key novels of sensibility (Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther), this article examines the root of a belief that exists even today: that, in a suicidal process, the invading Other could become the Self and, Trojan horse-style, destroy it from the inside.\n\n[Skyblue - the cyanometer of Horace-BÃ©nÃ©dict de Saussure (1740 - 1799)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBreidbach, Olaf; Karliczek, AndrÃ©\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe cyanometer is a simply constructed measuring instrument that enables a determination of skyblue. It consists of a color-scale that is arranged circularly going in equal steps from white to blue (Prussian blue) and finally into black. According to its inventor--Horace-BÃ©nÃ©dict de Saussure--the azure is determined by the amount of so called opaque vapors in the atmosphere associated with meteorological phenomena. As outlined by De Saussure, the blackness of the universe seen through an illuminated and blurred medium results in azure. Thereby his instrument offers a relative scale that is consistent with color theories of his time like those of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The description allows the construction of the scale without the employment of standardized color-prints. Instead he provides a clear report of the necessary procedures to produce such a scale. The accuracy of this description is tested and discussed employing the methods of experimental history of science. The reception of the cyanometer in the time about 1800 and its implications on color theories is discussed.\n\nDid goethe describe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?\n\nPubMed\n\nBonazza, Sara; Scaglione, Cesa; Poppi, Massimo; Rizzo, Giovanni\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAs early as 1846, the typical symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were described by Heinrich Hoffmann (1809-1894).

Research on archived original documents in Bonn, Vienna and Linz on the Danube made it possible to reveal details about the relationship inside this famous family and describes the hurdles of life of a successful apothecary. In 1776 Johann van Beethoven was born as the fourth child of the Beethoven family, a family of Bonner musicians. In 1790 he began his apprenticeship to become an apothecary at the Bonner \"Hofapotheke\". Towards the end of 1795 he moved to join his older brothers Ludwig and Karl in Vienna. During his time there he worked as a \"subject\" in various Viennese pharmacies. However in 1808 he purchased the pharmacy \"Zur Goldenen Krone\" in Linz on the Danube. His new pharmacy flourished, supplying first the Napoleonic occupation troops, and later the Austrian Military with medicines and field dressing/bandage materials. When in 1812 he married his Housekeeper, his Brother Ludwig opposed harshly, on reasons of social status and on moral grounds. Four years later, in 1816 Johann sold the pharmacy in Linz and founded a new pharmacy in Urfahr, on the opposite bank of the Danube. In 1819 he became a squire (or landowner), when he purchased a manor estate in Gneixendorf, near Krems on the Danube. In spite of his numerous duties as an apothecary and squire, Johann was frequently resident in Vienna, supporting his brother both emotionally and pharmaceutically. At the end of his life Johann sold both his pharmacy and the Gneixendorf estate, and spent his last years as a private gentleman living a dazzling lifestyle in Vienna. He died on January 12th 1848 and was buried in Vienna's \"WaldmÃ¼llerpark\".\n\nWilliam Wolfgang Brickman, 1913-86.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nParker, Franklin\n\nWilliam Wolfgang Brickman, founding member and President, 1956-59, of the Comparative and International Education Society, died June 22, 1986, in a Philadelphia hospital leukemia unit.

W. v. Goethe.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolm-Hadulla, Rainer M; Roussel, Martin; Hofmann, Frank-Hagen\n\n2010-12-01\n\nGoethe was one of the most creative poets, scientists and statesmen ever existing. Since the age of fourteen, he suffered from severe mood swings. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to temperamental and poetic melancholy, depressive episodes, dysthymic phases, and creativity are unique in respect to their phenomenological precision and richness. Furthermore, his (self-) therapeutic strategies and his self transformation in literature remain interesting until today for psychopathology, psychotherapy and creativity research. Goethe's self-assessments in his works and letters as well as the description of him by others are analysed by phenomenological and hermeneutic methods from the perspective of current psychiatric classification and psychotherapeutic knowledge. From a modern scientific perspective Goethe's mood swings are not to be regarded as expressions of a \"poet's melancholy\" in fashion at his time but as symptoms of depressive episodes. Several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed which were characterized by long lasting depressive mood, lack of drive, interests and self-esteem combined with social retreat and physical illness. Moreover, Goethe described a mood disorder which fits into the modern concept of \"driven dysthymia\" or Bipolar II disorder. Goethe's depressive moods were associated with eminent poetic creativity whereas in times of scientific and political productivity Goethe seemed to be protected against depressive episodes. Phenomenological and hermeneutic analysis cannot offer causal explanations but only reasons for understanding and communicative action. In Goethe's life poetic incubation, illumination and elaboration seemed to be associated with psychic labilisation and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. Thus, creative work was on the one hand triggered by depressive and dysthymic moods and served on the other hand to cope with depressive moods as well as with suicidal\n\nGoethe's Theory of Color and Scientific Intuition\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZajonc, Arthur G.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nSummarizes Goethe's color studies and his methods of study.

Goethe's campaign to improve the race.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchoenl, William; Peck, Danielle\n\n2010-06-01\n\nOver the last several decades historians have shown that the eugenics movement appealed to an extraordinarily wide constituency. Far from being the brainchild of the members of any one particular political ideology, eugenics made sense to a diverse range of Americans and was promoted by professionals ranging from geneticists and physicians to politicians and economists.(1) Seduced by promises of permanent fixes to national problems, and attracted to the idea of a scientifically legitimate form of social activism, eugenics quickly grew in popularity during the first decades of the twentieth century. Charles M. Goethe, the land developer, entrepreneur, conservationist and skilled advertiser who founded the Eugenics Society of Northern California, exemplifies the broad appeal of the eugenics movement. Goethe played an active role within the American eugenics movement at its peak in the 1920s. The last president of the Eugenics Research Association,(2) he also campaigned hard against Mexican immigration to the US and he continued open support for the Nazi regime's eugenic practices into the later 1930s.(3) This article examines Goethe's eugenic vision and, drawing on his correspondence with the leading geneticist Charles Davenport, explores the relationship between academic and non-academic advocates of eugenics in America.

This essay on the vertigo Goethe suffered on the tower of the Strasbourg Minster attempts to trace the vicissitudes of interpreting an emblem, like vertigo, burdened by cultural meaning and implications. Thus, Goethe's own report of this event 40 years after the fact, in his \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\", has to be related to another, hidden chronology of vertigo and fear in his account which, at first glance, conveys quite different implications. The first part of this paper refers to a medical interpretation of Goethe's dread of high places and his way of coping with it which, today, could be defined as a typical example of a behaviourist approach. In the second part, Goethe's vertigo is linked to psychoanalytic, literary, and historical reflections on the meanings of symptoms we connect today with medical terms like anxiety, phobia, and vertigo. Goethe's vertigo is shown as a complex problem--not only for himself but also for its interpreters: on the one hand, it tells its own story-within-a-story; on the other, it depends on the tools it was written with. Traditional approaches of medical history try to find symptoms and traces of diseases known to us today in literary texts, an approach which is as dubious as taking today's tools of medical analysis, such as psychoanalytic terms and concepts, to explain specific phenomena in literature without first carefully analysing these methods themselves, and only then subjecting the text to an analysis based on them. Nevertheless, this essay does not contest the justification of interpreting literary texts in the light of today's medical knowledge, but postulates that it should be clear which type of medical knowledge is applied. It is quite possible to read Goethe's account only as an old tale of acrophobia, but how will this help us? It seems more interesting to look at the link between the feeling of dizziness he experienced on\n\n[Goethe's struggle with depression].\n\nPubMed\n\nNager, F\n\n1991-09-17\n\nGoethe was subjected during his whole life to extraordinary psychic threats and polar tensions often to the limits of destruction. For long periods of life he travelled in the mist of depression. By steady patience, constant endurance, disciplined diligence, self-control and self-denial as well as restless activity inward and outward he resisted serious depressive threats and did not get paralyzed. He rather faced his spiritual sorrow creatively and forced it into curative poetry. While being completely uncommon, his wise but old-fashioned recipes on ways to master one's depression are a psychotherapeutic bequest and remain valuable up to our days as complement to our modern concepts.\n\nGoethe's anxieties, depressive episodes and (self-)therapeutic strategies: a contribution to method integration in psychotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolm-Hadulla, Rainer M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn psychiatry and psychotherapy, abstract scientific principles need to be exemplified by narrative case reports to gain practical precision. Goethe was one of the most creative writers, productive scientists, and effective statesmen that ever lived. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to anxieties, depressive episodes, dysthymia, and creativity are unique in their phenomenological precision and richness. His life and work can thus serve as an excellent example enhancing our understanding of the relationship between anxiety, depression and creativity. Furthermore, he described (self-)therapeutic strategies that reinforce and refine modern views. Goethe's self-assessments in his works and letters, and the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of current psychiatric classification. His therapeutic techniques and recommendations are compared with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and existential psychotherapy to amplify modern concepts of psychotherapy. From a scientific perspective, several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed in Goethe's life. They were characterized by extended depressive moods, lack of drive, and loss of interest and self-esteem combined with social retreat. Goethe displayed diffuse and phobic anxieties as well as dysthymia. His (self-)therapeutic strategies were: (a) the systematic use of helping alliances, (b) behavioral techniques, (c) cognitive reflection on meanings and beliefs, (d) psychodynamic and psychoanalytic remembering, repeating, and working through, and (e) existential striving for self-actualization, social commitment, meaning, and creativity. In Goethe's life, creative incubation, illumination, and elaboration appear to have been associated with psychic instability and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. On the one hand, his creative work was triggered by anxieties, dysthymia, and depressive moods. On the other hand, his creativity\n\nChronotopoi of the Good Life and Utopia: Bakhtin on Goethe's \"Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister\" and the Carnivalesque\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFranke, Norman\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper explores Bakhtin's reception of Goethe's \"Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre\" with a view to assess how Bakhtin's interest in this early chronotopical masterpiece can be understood in the wider context of his utopian thinking and his political eschatologies.

The most interesting of the manuscripts include Wolfgang's Autobiografia [Autobiography], written in 1850, and a list of his publications covering a total of 57 items (including some that have hitherto remained unknown), a work entitled Historya Farmakologii i Farmacyi [History of pharmacology and pharmacy], and a particularly valuable manuscript (666 + 12 sheets) entitled Farmakologiia [Pharmacology]. Worth mentioning are also two catalogues of books from Wolfgang's library: one compiled by Wolfgang himself (37 sheets) and the other by Adam Ferdynand Adamowicz. The content of the autobiography manuscript is contained on five sheets. The author of the present article analyzes the document, comparing the information contained in it with the biographies of J. F. Wolfgang that hhave been published so far (these being primarily the biography by Dominik Cezary ChodYko, published in 1863, and that by Witold W3odzimierz G3owacki of 1960). The text of the autobiography is quoted in full, together with numerous comments. The analysis of the manuscript as well as the biographical data contained in the above-mentioned biographies indicate that Wolfgang had great achievements as a scientist (in both research and organizational work), as a champion of public causes and as an educator of a generation of botanists-pharmacognostics. It also transpires from the autobiography, as well as from the research by historians, that he was a very good and trustful person, who readily granted access to his research to his collaborators\n\nHighs and Lows of Goethe\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nScale: The width of this image is about 250 kilometers (150 miles) Topographic information from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) is used to colorize a image mosaic of Goethe basin, located in Mercury's northern region.

He created a sequence of experiments which produced what appeared to be anomalies in Newton's theory. What he was carefully illustrating concerns limitations accepted when following a scientifically objective approach. Newton was concerned with the description of 'facts' derived from the analysis of observations. Goethe was concerned with the synthesis of meaning. He then went on to describe subjective techniques for training 'the mind's eye' to work efficiently in the subjective world of the imagination. Derided as 'not science', what he was actually describing is the skill which is central to creative design.\n\nA review of electron-phonon coupling seen in the high-Tc superconductors by angle-resolved photoemission studies (ARPES)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCuk, T.; Lu, D.

L. Ginzburg and E. G. Maksimov [1].The cover picture, taken from the review [2] by T. Cuk et al., shows plots of the electron-phonon coupling vertex, g2(k, k), where k, k are the initial and final electron momentum for electrons scattered by the bond-buckling phonon B1g (the out-of-phase vibration of the in-plane oxygen) in a tight-binding model of the copper-oxygen plane. The momentum dependence of this vertex, along with the d-wave superconducting gap and the van Hove singularity at the anti-node, accounts for the momentum dependence of the collective mode coupling seen in angle-resolved photoemission data on Bi2212.The present issue also sees the start of our rapid research letters, the fastest peer-reviewed publication medium in solid state physics.

E.; Dobrescu, S.; Badescu-Singureanu, Al. I.; Schmidt, L.; Hohn, O.; Runkel, S.\n\n1999-02-01\n\nA new approach of the possibility to significantly increase the high charge state ion beams delivered by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion sources by using metal-dielectric (MD) structures characterized by high secondary electron emission properties is presented. The intensities of argon ion beams extracted from the 14 GHz electron cyclotron resonance ion source of the Institut fÃ¼r Kernphysik (IKF) der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-UniversitÃ¤t in Frankfurt/Main were measured when a 26 mm diam disk of a specially treated MD structure (Al-Al2O3) was introduced axially close to the ECR plasma. The Ar beam intensities and charge-state distributions obtained with this disk are compared to measurements with disks of iron and pure aluminum at the same position relative to the plasma. All measurements were performed with the disk at the plasma chamber potential. The results with the MD structure show a net shift of the beam intensity towards higher charge states as compared with the other disk materials. Enhancement factors of the beam current of up to 10 (for Ar12+) when using a MD disk compared to the output when using an aluminum disk and up to 40 (for Ar11+) when using an iron disk were measured.\n\nGoethe and the ABC model of flower development.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoen, E\n\n2001-06-01\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the ABC model for the genetic control of flower development was proposed.

At the same time, with todayÃ¢ÂÂs new communication possibilities the demand and expectations of effective medical treatment have been increased. This presentation will illustrate the need for the Ã¢ÂÂindustrializationÃ¢ÂÂ of healthcare in order to achieve highest results at limited budgets. Thereby, industrialization is not meaning the medical treatment based on the assembly line approach. Rather it is to recognize the cost of medical care as an investment with respective expectations on the return of the investment. Innovations in imaging and pharmaceutical products as well as in processes - that lead to similar medical results, but with lower efforts - are keys in such scenarios.

Towards the end of the 19th century, he demonstrated how the principle of actualism can be applied to Precambrian terranes, while during the early part of the 20th century he undertook detailed studies on deformed magmatic rocks, both defining and interpreting the enigmatic mixed rocks now known as migmatites. He acted as the head of the Geological Survey of Finland for 40 years, which developed under his leadership into a modern progressive and versatile research organization. In addition, Sederholm also served as a diplomat with a number of international assignments, including appointments with the League of Nations in missions in Albania and a supervisory role relating to sovereignty and autonomy issues in the Ã land Island. Several mountains in Greenland have been named after him and his family, and he was also appointed as honorary chief of two Indian tribes in Canada. To understand the driving forces behind a man of his kind, we focus here on Sederholm the person and some of the social and cultural background that influenced his career. This text is based on the book, published in Swedish, entitled \"Jakob Johannes Sederholm, Geolog, humanist och sanningssÃ¶kare\" (Scheinin and Korsman, 2007), and an interview with J.J.

It proposes a focus on the textbooks written by the German botanist Ludwig Reichenbach and his first attempt to use Goethe's idea of metamorphosis of plants as fundamental to his natural system of plants published under the title 'Botany for Women', in German Botanik fÃ¼r Damen (1828). In this book, Reichenbach paid particular attention to Goethe's sensitive views on the essence of nature; he regarded Goethe's idea of metamorphosis in the plant kingdom as an ideal model to interpret connections of natural phenomena, in particular as a conceptual frame for a natural system. Furthermore, he aimed to develop the philosophical statement of the metamorphosis, in which he called for nature-philosophical conceptions in order to materialize his representation of plant \"affinities,\" and of a kind of \"ontogeny\" of the whole plant kingdom. This paper demonstrates that, between speculative views and empirical attempts, the extent to which Reichenbach actually belonged to a new \"school\" of thought, which left its mark on the history and philosophy of botany.\n\nMicrosatellite Instability Occurs Rarely in Patients with Cholangiocarcinoma: A Retrospective Study from a German Tertiary Care Hospital.\n\nPubMed\n\nWinkelmann, Ria; Schneider, Markus; Hartmann, Sylvia; Schnitzbauer, Andreas A; Zeuzem, Stefan; Peveling-Oberhag, Jan; Hansmann, Martin Leo; Walter, Dirk\n\n2018-05-09\n\nImmune-modulating therapy is a promising therapy for patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Microsatellite instability (MSI) might be a favorable predictor for treatment response, but comprehensive data on the prevalence of MSI in CCA are missing. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of MSI in a German tertiary care hospital. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples, obtained in the study period from 2007 to 2015 from patients with CCA undergoing surgical resection with curative intention at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University hospital, were examined. All samples were investigated immunohistochemically for the presence of MSI (expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) as well as by pentaplex polymerase chain reaction for five quasimonomorphic mononucleotide repeats ( BAT-25 , BAT-26 , NR-21 , NR-22 , and NR-24 ). In total, 102 patients were included, presenting intrahepatic ( n = 35, 34.3%), perihilar ( n = 42, 41.2%), and distal CCA ( n = 25, 24.5%). In the immunohistochemical analysis, no loss of expression of DNA repair enzymes was observed. In the PCR-based analysis, one out of 102 patients was found to be MSI-high and one out of 102 was found to be MSI-low. Thus, MSI seems to appear rarely in CCA in Germany. This should be considered when planning immune-modulating therapy trials for patients with CCA.\n\n[The ideas that are seen. Form and perception in Goethe and Paolo Bozzi].\n\nPubMed\n\nGiacomoni, Paola\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis article presents a comparative analysis of Paolo Bozzi's experimental phenomenology and of J.W. Goethe's morphological method, which is considered one of the Italian scholar's sources of inspiration. Starting from Bozzi's education within the Gestalt psychology tradition, under the guidance of Gaetano Kanizsa, and taking into account also the recent interest shown for Bozzi by several exponents of the analytic tradition, this work draws attention to the basic features of the methodology adopted by the perceptologist in his work. In this regard, what proves to be fundamental is the role played by the various techniques of inter-observation by means of an active and practical approach to the material, rather than a purely contemplative one. Bozzi's interest in Goethe's naturalistic writings, from the morphological ones to the Farbenlehre (Theory of colours), makes it possible to highlight significant analogies and conceptual continuities with Goethe's epistemology. First of all, a link between these two styles of research is provided by the subject \"form,\" or Gestalt, and its direct, accurate observation, as well as its presence in non-conventional contexts and its non-metaphysical character. Furthermore, it is evident that both authors employ a conception of experiment that is repeatable, conducted almost always in conditions that are open and not of the laboratory. Not less relevant is their scientific style, in which the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification plays no role.

The relation with the ancient chinese schools of cosmography has been discussed: From the the Pythagorean to the ancient Chinese schools of cosmography we find arithmo-geometrical applications of numbers which are emblematic, hold meaning or represent the essence of things, the author writes.

The reason for this discrepancy is not only found in the basically different systems of harmonics of both researchers, but also in the different positions that were taken by both within the controversy about the heliocentric system of the world.\n\nDeterminants and Politics of German Military Transformation in the Post-Cold War Era\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2011-06-01\n\nJahrhundert, eds.

Over the last 100 years, medical science has investigated the physical sufferings and the mysterious death of Mozart with increasing intensity. By means of letters from his father Leopold, his sister \"Nannerl\", himself and reports from his physicians and contemporaries, we would like to create a medical pathography. The rumour that Mozart was poisoned appeared soon after his early death at the age of 35 on December 5th 1791, and was kept up persistently. Accused were the physician van Swieten, Mozart's freemason's loge and the royal band master Salieri. Mozart, however, died due to chronic kidney disease and ultimately due to uraemia. Once the renal damage has reached a certain point, a minimum of additional stress leads to decompensation. This catastrophe occurs typically within the fourth decade of life. When listening to Mozart's music, we should remember that this apparently happy person was actually a premature adult robbed of his childhood, whose short life was an endless chain of indisposition, over fatigue, misery, concern and illness.\n\nSignal transduction in the footsteps of goethe and schiller.\n\nPubMed\n\nFriedrich, Karlheinz; Lindquist, Jonathan A; Entschladen, Frank; Serfling, Edgar; Thiel, Gerald; Kieser, Arnd; Giehl, Klaudia; Ehrhardt, Christina; Feller, Stephan M; Ullrich, Oliver; Schaper, Fred; Janssen, Ottmar; Hass, Ralf\n\n2009-02-04\n\nThe historical town of Weimar in Thuringia, the \"green heart of Germany\" was the sphere of Goethe and Schiller, the two most famous representatives of German literature's classic era.

From such Primal Phenomena emerge derived phenomena, or \"Types\", which are made substantial by processes that uniquely define Life and Living. Biosemiosis arises and takes place within the derived Types. Examples of Primal Phenomena and their derivatives are taken from recent observations on the putative influence of the lunisolar gravitational force upon animal and plant behavior, and from some aspects of plant development that show connection with Goethe's idea of the 'Urpflanze'.\n\nArzt und Hobby-Astronom in stÃ¼rmischen Zeiten Der BÃ¼chernachlass des Doktor Johannes HÃ¤ringshauser, Viertelsmedicus in Mistelbach (1630-1641) in der Melker Stiftsbibliothek.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDavison, Giles; GlaÃner, Gottfried\n\n2009-06-01\n\nAuf der Suche nach astronomischer Literatur stieÃ Giles Davison in der Melker Stiftsbibliothek auf den Namen \"Doctor Johannes HÃ¤ringshauserâ als Besitzer seltener und interessanter astronomischer Werke u.a. von Johannes Regiomontan, Georg von Peuerbach, Michael MÃ¤stlin, Johannes Kepler und Daniel Sennert.

He fastidiously attended to the subtleties of visual expression through geometry, composition, and precise mastery of the rules of perspective. It has been our impression that some visual similarity does exist between neuroendoscopic images and some of Vermeer's paintings. Such a relation could be explained by the fact that optical devices are utilized in producing both types of display. Methods: We reviewed the pertinent medical and art literature, observed some video clips of our endoscopy cases, and inspected digital high resolution images of Vermeer's paintings in order to elaborate on shared optical phenomena between neuroendoscopic views and Vermeer's paintings. Results: Specific optical phenomena are indeed shared by Johannes Vermeer's works and neuroendoscopic vision, namely light and color effects as well as the rules of perspective. Conclusion: From the physical point of view, the possibility that a camera obscura inspired Vermeer's artistic creation makes the existence of a visual link between his paintings and the endoscopic views of the intracranial cavity comprehensible. PMID:25140282\n\nA translational study \"case report\" on the small molecule \"energy blocker\" 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) as a potent anticancer agent: from bench side to bedside.\n\nPubMed\n\nKo, Y H; Verhoeven, H A; Lee, M J; Corbin, D J; Vogl, T J; Pedersen, P L\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe small alkylating molecule, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), is a potent and specific anticancer agent. 3BP is different in its action from most currently available chemo-drugs. Thus, 3BP targets cancer cells' energy metabolism, both its high glycolysis (\"Warburg Effect\") and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This inhibits/ blocks total energy production leading to a depletion of energy reserves. Moreover, 3BP as an \"Energy Blocker\", is very rapid in killing such cells. This is in sharp contrast to most commonly used anticancer agents that usually take longer to show a noticeable effect. In addition, 3BP at its effective concentrations that kill cancer cells has little or no effect on normal cells. Therefore, 3BP can be considered a member, perhaps one of the first, of a new class of anticancer agents. Following 3BP's discovery as a novel anticancer agent in vitro in the Year 2000 (Published in Ko et al. Can Lett 173:83-91, 2001), and also as a highly effective and rapid anticancer agent in vivo shortly thereafter (Ko et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 324:269-275, 2004), its efficacy as a potent anticancer agent in humans was demonstrated. Here, based on translational research, we report results of a case study in a young adult cancer patient with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, a bench side discovery in the Department of Biological Chemistry at Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine was taken effectively to bedside treatment at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt/Main Hospital, Germany. The results obtained hold promise for 3BP as a future cancer therapeutic without apparent cyto-toxicity when formulated properly.\n\n[Possibilities and limits of retrospective diagnoses. Pathobiografical notes on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's diseases (1756-1791)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBauer, Axel W\n\n2006-01-01\n\nOn December 5th, 1791, Wolfgang AmadÃ© Mozart died from an acute febrile disease which had been accompanied by painful tumefactions around his hands and feet. The official diagnosis 'hitziges Frieselfieber' (severe military fever) cannot be decoded or translated into modern medical terms. Hypotheses which assert either a wilful or an erroneous poisoning with mercuric chloride have not been corroborated. Innumerable diverging retrospective diagnoses have been made by physicians during the 19th and 20th centuries. In this essay, we give a pathobiografical description of Mozart's three severe diseases from which he suffered as a boy: When traveling through Europe with his parents and his sister to give many exhausting concerts Wolfgang AmadÃ© fell ill with an Erythema nodosum (1762), an abdominal typhus (1765), and with smallpox (1767). With regard to the 24 years between 1767 and 1791, however, we don't have much evidence for the suspicion that Mozart has had severe acute or chronic diseases as a grown-up. He may have been physically robust, but mentally he was rather sensitive. In his letters, Mozart sometimes portrayed a temporary bad state of health in order to illustrate his inconvenient emotional and/or financial situation. Up to November 18, 1791, Mozart's creativity was unbroken. His death came unexpectedly after an illness of 15 days.\n\n[The controversy regarding the cause of death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (28 January 1756-5 May 1791)].\n\nPubMed\n\nLudewig, R\n\n1991-09-01\n\nAll since two hundred years closely contested hypotheses about the causes of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's death are to be verified and to be made credible by the same \"original sources\" in spite of considerable contrasts.

Over the last 100 years, medical science has investigated the physical sufferings and the mysterious death of Mozart with increasing intensity. The aim of this article was to recreate Mozart's pathography relying on the his correspondence with father Leopold and sister Nannerl and on reports from his physicians and contemporaries. The rumour that Mozart was poisoned followed shortly after his death on 5 December 1791, at the age of 35, and has survived to this day. The alleged culprits were his physician van Swieten, Mozart's freemasons lodge, and the Imperial Chapel Master Salieri. Mozart however died of chronic kidney disease and ultimately of uraemia. If kidney damage reaches a critical point, even a minimum additional stress can lead to its failure. This usually occurs in the fourth decade of life. Next time we listen to Mozart, we should remember that this apparently happy person was actually a precocious boy, ripped of his childhood, whose short life was an endless chain of complaints, fatigue, misery, concern, and malady.\n\nIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci in the green leafhopper Empoasca vitis Goethe (Homoptera).\n\nPubMed\n\nPapura, D; Giresse, X; Chauvin, B; Caron, H; Delmotte, F; VAN Helden, M\n\n2009-05-01\n\nEight dinucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized within the green leafhopper Empoasca vitis (Goethe) using an enrichment cloning procedure.

These microsatellite markers should prove to be a useful tool for estimating the population genetic structure, host-plant specialization and migration capacity of this insect. Â© 2009 The Authors.

In contrast to the German scientists, the French, especially those from the School of Montpellier, accepted Zimmermann's medical views as a confirmation of vitalism and neohippocratic medicine. In Germany, Zimmermann's medical works fell into oblivion after his death until the middle of 20th century. This may be a consequence of his intimate contacts to the European high nobility and of his polemic attacks against friends and enemies as well as his contempt for all forms of democracy and the French Revolution.\n\nJohannes Heinrich Schultz and National Socialism.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrunner, JÃ¼rgen; Schrempf, Matthias; Steger, Florian\n\n2008-01-01\n\nJohannes Heinrich Schultz (1884-1970) established the set of techniques known as \"autogenic training.\" From 1936 until 1945 he worked as assistant director of the GÃ¶ring Institute. His role during National Socialism has been underestimated in our opinion. We considered Schultz's academic publications and his \"autobiography\" from 1964. Schultz publicly advocated compulsory sterilization as well as the \"annihilation of life unworthy of life\" and developed a diagnostic scheme which distinguished between the neurotic/curable and the hereditary/ incurable. In fact, this classification was then employed to decide between life and death. In order to justify the \"New German Psychotherapy\" alongside eugenic psychiatry, Schultz carried out degrading and inhuman \"treatments\" of homosexual prisoners of concentration camps who were in mortal danger. This study was based on written documents. We were not able to interview contemporary witnesses. By advocating compulsory sterilization and the \"annihilation of life unworthy of life\" and by the abuse of homosexuals as research objects Schultz violated fundamental ethical principles of psychiatry.\n\nAlcatraz and Iser: Applying Wolfgang Iser's Concepts of Implied Reader and Implied Author and Reality to the Metafictive Alcatraz Smedry Series\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCastleman, Michele D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAs a narrative series, Brandon Sanderson's humorous, middle grade, Alcatraz Smedry novels display some of the arguably vague concepts of Reader Response theorist Wolfgang Iser as accessible themes that encourage a critical understanding of the stories. \"Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians\" (2007), \"Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones\" (2008) andâ¦\n\n[Johann Gregor Gutturff: the life and work of a plague barber on the 17th century].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchlenkrich, Elke\n\n2002-01-01\n\nJohann Gregor Gutturff was a plague barber in the Dresden epidemic of 1680, and important records of his life and work have survived.

The sources provide information relating to medical diagnosis and treatment; the barber's relationship to his patients; and the public's perception of the barber and his work. There is also a good deal to be learned relating to Johann Gregor Gutturff himself: his self-perception as a person suffering from plague, his experience under the plague regiment, and other opinions and reflections.

Besides his astronomical work, Kepler also made important contributions in the fields of theology, physics, phylosophy and mathematics. The actual paper discusses the advances by Kepler in the application of mathematics to the solution of \"real life problems\". The author made a concise account of some of the disciples by Kepler: Klug, Wieleitner, Caspar, Hammer, paying particular attention to works published by Kepler while he was living in Linz (1612-1628). The Kepler's contribution to applied mathematics is an example supremely worthy of emulation, the author concludes.\n\nThe Comparative Study: Aesthetic and Love in Hafiz and Goethe's Poetry in Order to Awaken and Bring Perfection in Global Education\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSajjadi, Seyed Mahdi; Mahdavi, Zainab\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn the middle of eighteen century, sources of the East were considered by European visitors.

Specifically, the music of Mozart with its \"Mozart effect\" is appropriate to use in neurosurgery. We investigated the relationship between Mozart's music and neurosurgery. We used digital catalogs like \"PubMed\" and the libraries of universities. Key words were \"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\" and \"neurosurgery and music.\" In the first half of the 20th century, performing neurosurgery on some musicians, such as Maurice Ravel, Josef Hassid, and George Gershwin, resulted in a fatal outcome. The cause of this is probably that neurosurgery had not been developed yet in the first half of the 20th century. In the past 3 decades, the neurosurgical operations of musicians show that musicians have rich associations among auditory, somatic, and sensorial systems. It is clear that we have much to learn from studies about music and brain function that derive from our surgical experiences with patients. The neuronal plasticity of musicians' brains may be different from that of nonmusicians' brains. Musicians with enhanced motor skills have greater capacity for plasticity because of enriched interhemispheric connections. Listening to music and the effect of Mozart in neurosurgical practice, intensive care, or rehabilitation were documented in many studies. As authors, we mean something different: Its effectiveness should be studied. We concluded that in current neurosurgical practice, Mozart has an effect. More research and clinical studies are needed.

He became a Hofmedicus at the court and in the field of the Thirty Years War in 1627-1630 and then a Viertelmedicus at Mistelbach in Niederoesterreich in 1630 until 1641. His purchase of books had initially concentrated on medical topics but from 1636 to 1640 he bought some ten books on astronomy, including two by Johannes Kepler and one by Michael MÃ¤stlin, Kepler's tutor at TÃ¼bingen. The fact that he acquired the books by MÃ¤stlin and Kepler so soon after Galileo's trial shows him to have been a courageous independently minded thinker with wide ranging professional and intellectual interests.

Pushing off from Jung with Wolfgang Giegerich.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaban, Mark\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThis paper responds to a recent paper by Wolfgang Giegerich entitled 'Two Jungs: apropos a paper by Mark Saban'. Giegerich disputes my assertion that the 'rigorous notion' at the heart of his psychology 'finds no source in Jung's psychology, implicit or explicit'. In order to do this he posits the existence of two Jungs, an exoteric Jung and an esoteric Jung. The implications of Giegerich's binary scission of Jung are explored in this paper, and show that the tendency to exalt one Jung while disparaging the other betrays a comprehensive blindness toward the contradictory complexity of Jung's psychology as a whole. It is suggested that this blindness is the consequence of Giegerich's systematic prioritization of a neo-Hegelian agenda that is in profound conflict with the telos of Jung's psychology.

His early inclination was for physics, which he found more attractive than purely geometric and algebraic studies, but his father was not able to make it possible for him to study physics, and so he studied medicine in order to earn a living. His lecture before the Physical Society in Berlin on July 23, 1847, 'about the conservation of the force' marked an epochal turn, even though his intention had been to deliver 'merely, some critical investigations and arrangement of facts in favor of the physiologists' as well as good arguments for the refusal of the theory of 'vitality'. Even though these new concepts were at first dismissed as fantastic speculation by some of the authorities in physics and philosophy of the day, they were enthusiastically welcomed by younger students of philosophy and the older men soon had to allow themselves to be persuaded that the effectiveness of vitality, though great and beautiful, is actually always dependent on some source of energy. Helmholtz critically assessed Goethe as a physical scientist but he did not dispute his great importance as a poet. Copyright Â© 2012 S.

Addressing all of these areas in his comprehensive book, De stella nova (1606), Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) studied the new star extensively under the aegis of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II (1552-1612) in Prague. The focus of the following presentation is Kepler's theory of the new star's origins in the celestial ether. Describing the heavens poetically as a fertile expanse of \"liquid fields\", Kepler suggested that the new star sprung from the celestial ether much like the numerous living beings in the sublunary realm which were spontaneously generated from the Earth. As evidence for his claim, Kepler pointed to the conspicuous mathematical patterns similarly observed in earthly and celestial entities. Kepler's efficient cause for this explanation, known as the animate faculty, accounted for both the generation and form of new phenomena in the celestial and terrestrial realms. The new star of 1604 proved to be no exception.\n\nJohannes Kepler - And the New Astronomy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVoelkel, James R.\n\n1999-11-01\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571-1630) is remembered as one of the greatest medieval astronomers in the tradition of Copernicus and Galileo, a man who made major contributions to physics, astronomy, and mathematics. Born in Germany and trained as a theologian, Kepler did not hesitate to challenge church doctrine by supporting the iconoclastic theory of a Sun-centered solar system. As Imperial Mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor, he conducted careful observations of the night sky, which led to his discovery of the three Laws of Planetary Motion and the orbit of Mars. He also devised the Rudolphine Tables on planetary movements, and made key improvements to the telescope. Voelkel vividly describes the scientific achievements, providing enough background in physics and trigonometry so even beginners can enjoy this book. The author also gives us a captivating account of Kepler's tumultuous life"
