ES FLOG EIN KLEINS WALDVÖGELEIN\n\nAaberg, Jens Christian, 1877-1970\n\nAaberg, author of Hymns and Hymnwriters of Denmark, 1945, and editor of Favored Hymns and Songs, 1961, translated some eighty hymns and songs from Danish and served on the committees which compiled the American Lutheran Hymnal, 1930; the Hymnal for Church and Home, 1927; the Junior Hymnal for Church and Home, 1932; and the revised Hymnal for Church and Home, 1928. Born November 8, 1877, in Moberg on the West coast of Denmark, he came to the United States in 1901. He went to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to join his brother who was then studying for the ministry at Augsburg College and Seminary. After attending St. Ansgar’s College, and Grand View College and Seminary in Des Moines, Iowa, 1904-1908, he was ordained to the ministry of the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. His first call was to Marinette, Wisconsin, after which he was pastor from 1912 to 1926 of St. Peder’s Lutheran Church, Dwight, Illinois. From 1926 until his retirement in 1946 he served in Minneapolis. He held various offices throughout the synod, and in 1947 received the Knight Cross of Denmark from King Frederick. In 1908 he was married to Elsie Cathrine Raun. He died June 22, 1970. [© Hymnal Companion to the Lutheran Book of Worship]\n\n229. By Faith We Are Divinely Sure (Tr.)\n\n243. The Power of Sin No Longer (Tr.)\n\n529. Vain World, Now Farewell (Tr.)\n\nAdam of St. Victor, d. 1172\n\nADAM OF ST. VICTOR. Although Adam of St. Victor was one of the most prolific of the Latin hymnists of the Middle Ages, very little is known of him. He is called “Brito” by those nearest his own epoch; but whether this indicates “Britain” or “Brittany” is uncertain. Adam was educated at Paris, and about 1130, when still quite a young man, he became a monk in the Abbey of St. Victor. The abbey was then in the suburbs, but afterwards, through the growth of Paris, it was included within the walls of that city. In this abbey, which was celebrated as a school of theology, Adam passed the whole rest of his life.—Adam of St. Victor had a facile pen and spent his life in study and authorship. It is quite probable that he was the author of many more than the numerous hymns and sequences which are definitely known to be his. He was the author of several prose works as well. His sequences, which were in manuscript, were destroyed at the dissolution of the Abbey of St. Victor in the Revolution, but 37 of them had already found their way into general circulation. These were published by Clichtoveus, a Roman Catholic theologian of the first half of the 16th century in his Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum. Of the rest of the 106 hymns and sequences of his that we possess, the largest part—some 47 remaining unpublished—were removed to the National Library in the Louvre at Paris on the destruction of the abbey. There they were discovered by M. Leon Gautier, the editor of the first complete edition of them, Paris, 1858. Archbishop Trench, who published a selection of his poems in his Sacred Latin Poetry, says that Adam of St. Victor was “the foremost among the sacred poets of the Middle Ages.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n411. Christians, come in sweetest measures\n\nAgricola, Johannes, 1494-1566\n\nJohann Agricola (Johannes Eisleben) was born April 20, 1492, in Eisleben, where his father was employed as a tailor. At an early age he was sent to school at Brunswick. In 1515 he came to Wittenberg and was received by Luther, who became interested in the talented young man. He spent several years in Wittenberg and was admitted into the household of Luther, who also secured for him a teaching position at the university. He instructed a class in religion, for which purpose he prepared a catechism. In 1519 he accompanied Luther to the disputation with Dr. Eck at Leipzig, and it is claimed that Agricola was appointed to record the proceedings at this meeting. The same year he and Melanchthon received the degree of baccalaureus Bibliae at the University of Wittenberg. He was married in 1520 at Wittenberg. Luther, Melanchthon and other reformers were present at the wedding.\n\nAfter ten years of service in Wittenberg, he was, through Luther’s influence, in 1525, given the position of rector of the school in Eisleben, an institution lately established by Count Albrecht of Mecklenburg. In connection with this position he should also serve as preacher and pastor of the church of St. Nicholas in Eisleben, and here he gathered a faithful congregation. He was, however, not content with his position at the school, and in 1526 he applied for a professorship at the university. But Melanchthon was chosen in preference to Agricola. Agricola was deeply offended. He was not only disposed to be irritable and vain, but overestimated his own importance.\n\nHis activity and behavior in later years was not altogether praiseworthy. It soon became apparent that he nourished a grudge against Melanchthon. The fact of the matter was, that Melanchthon and Luther had for some time observed with anxiety that as the Reformation progressed, many became followers for the simple reason that they wished to join the popular movement, and not out of personal conviction from the Word of God. Indeed, many preachers proclaimed salvation through faith alone, but this was often received as a mere external adherence to Reformation ideas, without particularly affecting the life of the people. Melanchthon, accordingly, issued a circular letter wherein he admonished the Lutheran preachers not only to preach on faith, but also to encourage people to the confession of sin, repentance, and conversion, and to dwell upon the commandments of the Law. The same thoughts were repeated in his articles of visitation in Saxony. Agricola criticized these very severely, and, at the same time, directed a violent accusation against Melanchthon personally, charging him with abandoning the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and that Melanchthon was influenced again by the doctrine of the “work-righteousness” of Catholicism. Luther sought to put an end to this controversy and at the meeting in Torgau silenced Agricola. There is very little information in regard to Agricola’s activity during the next few years, except that he fell out with Duke Albrecht and was dismissed by him July 27, 1536. Even the same day Agricola went to Wittenberg, where Luther, thinking that he had bettered his ways, received him and his family into his household, and called him into consultation on the Smalcald Articles. More over, the elector promised him an annual allowance for delivering certain lectures at the university.\n\nBut in 1537 Agricola appeared in public with his perverted doctrine on the Law and thereby began the Antinomian controversy. Luther conducted five disputations with him, 1537-38, and forced him to retract his false teachings, and Luther was authorized to draw up the statement of retraction for Agricola to sign. While this was going on he learned that Luther had censured him in a private letter to a friend, and in 1540 Agricola sent a complaint against Luther to the elector. The proceedings took a sad turn for Agricola, who was arrested and set free only upon the promise that he would not leave Wittenberg until the case had been tried and settled. Despite his promise he slipped away and came to Berlin. The elector Joachim II became his protector, appointed Agricola court preacher, and later superintendent.\n\nFrom that time on Agricola opposed Luther and the other reformers, and later became the leader in the preparation and carrying out of the Augsburg Interim, which was chiefly a compromise between Catholicism and the Reformation and a denial of the fundamental principles of the Reformation. For this Agricola of course incurred the displeasure of the reformers. He died September, 1566. (H. Nutzhorn, from Herzog and Plitt). [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n255. Lord, Hear the Voice of My Complaint\n\nAhle, Johann Rudolph, 1625-73\n\nJohann Rudolph Ahle was born December 24, 1625, at Mühlhausen, Thuringia. He was educated at the universities of Göttingen and Erfurt. He was elected cantor at St. Andreas’s Church and director of the music school at Erfurt in 1646. Eight years later he was given the lucrative post as organist at St. Blasius’s Church, Mühlhausen, to succeed Johann Vockerrodt. In this town he became an influential citizen. He was elected to the town council in 1656 and made mayor in 1661. He died on July 8, 1673. — Ahle was a well-educated German organist and composer. While at Erfurt he became known as one of the most radical reformers of church music. He originated the “sacred aria.” He wrote over 400 spiritual songs for the different Sundays, festivals, and other special days in the calendar. Although florid writing was in vogue at the time, Ahle avoided polyphonic counterpoint and confined himself to the simple chorale style. Many songs of his are still popular in Protestant churches in England and America. Ahle’s son, Johann Georg Ahle, was also a composer of hymns and poet laureate to Emperor Leopold I. Ahle’s works include Compendium pro tonellis, 1648, a treatise on singing, and Neue Geistliche Arien, etc. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n1, 220, 244. LIEBSTER JESU (DESSAU)\n\nAlbert, Heinrich, 1604-51\n\nHeinrich Albert (Alberti) was born in Lobenstein, Germany, June 28, 1604. He studied jurisprudence in Leipzig, but later went to Dresden and studied music under his uncle, the noted Heinrich Schütz, “kapellmeister” at the court of Dresden. In 1626 he came to Königsberg, where he was appointed organist of the cathedral church in 1631. He was generally recognized and honored both as a poet and as a musician. He died in Königsberg, October 6, 1651. In his above mentioned publication are found 74 spiritual songs, 118 other poems, and 78 sacred melodies. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nHeinrich Albert was born at Lobenstein, Voigtland, June 28, 1604. He intended to study law at Leipzig, but devoted himself entirely to music, studying under his uncle, Heinrich Schütz, the Court Capellmeister at Dresden, later also under Johann Stobäus. In 1631 he was appointed organist of the Cathedral at Königsberg in Prussia, whither he had gone in 1626. In 1636 he became a member of the Poetical Union of that city, together with Dach, Roberthin, and nine others. He died October 6, 1651. His hymns appeared in his Arien, etliche theils geistliche, theils weltliche, etc., published first in eight parts (1638–1650), then in collected form, Königsberg, 1652.

GOTT DER ERDEN UND DES HIMMELS\n\nAlbinus, Johann Georg, 1624-79\n\nJohann Georg Albinus, the oldest son of Zacharias Albinus, a pastor in Unter-Nessa, near Weissenfels, was born March 6, 1624. After the death of his father he was adopted by his cousin Lucas Pollio, a deacon of St. Nicholas’ church in Leipzig. After the latter’s death the court preacher, Sebastian Mitternacht of Naumburg, took care of him until he began his studies at the University of Leipzig, in 1645. During his eight years of study here he served as tutor in the home of Dr. F. Kühlwein, the mayor of the city. In 1653 he was called to become rector of the cathedral school in Naumburg. He held this position until the year 1657, when he became the pastor of St. Othmar’s church in the same city. Albinus was an industrious and devout pastor, but he was subjected to many difficulties on account of his physical weakness and because of the troubles within his church. On Sunday, May 25, 1679, he quietly passed away.\n\nDuring his student days he was well known as a poet, and in 1654 became a member of the Fruitbearing Society. He wrote several hymns marked by their religious depth and harmony with the doctrine of Scripture. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nALBINUS, JOHANN GEORG, eldest son of Zacharias Albinus, a pastor, was born at Unter-Nessa, near Weissenfels, Saxony, March 6, 1624. After his father’s death, in 1635, he was adopted by a cousin, in 1638. This cousin was Lucas Pollio, diaconus at St. Nicholas Church in Leipzig. When Pollio died in 1643, the court preacher, Sebastian Mitternacht of Naumburg, took an interest in Albinus, who remained with him until he entered the University of Leipzig in 1645. While there, he became the house tutor to the burgomaster, Dr. Friedrich Kühlwein, and was later, in 1653, appointed rector of the Cathedral School at Naumburg. Four years later he resigned and became the pastor of St. Othmar’s Church in the same city. He was a zealous pastor, seeking ever “the glory of God, the edification of the church, and the everlasting salvation, well-being and happiness of his hearers.” He died on Rogate Sunday, May 25, 1679. As poet he was, says Koch, “distinguished by ease of style, force of expression, and liveliness of fancy, and his manner of thought was Scriptural and pervaded by deep religious spirit.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n454. Not in Anger, Mighty God\n\n472. All men living are but mortal\n\nAlbrecht von Brandenburg, 1522-77\n\nAlbrecht von Brandenburg was born at Ansbach on March 28, 1522. He was the son of Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Culmbach in Lower Franconia. He was well educated by his uncle, Georg of Brandenburg. Later he became a soldier and was known as the “German Alcibiades.” Albrecht accompanied Charles V to his French War in 1544 and against the Smalkald Evangelical Union in 1546. In 1552 he joined the princes against the Emperor. Albrecht met Moritz of Saxony in the Battle of Lüneburg, July 9, 1553, at Sievershausen and was defeated. He met him again on June 13, 1554, at Brunswick and finally on June 13 at Eulenberg. Albrecht escaped to France with sixteen followers. He acknowledged God’s direction in his troubles and repented of his former errors. He returned to Regensburg and died at Pforzheim, repentant and firm in the faith, on January 8, 1557.

Dykes, was born at Hull, August 16, 1818. In 1850 she was married to Rev. Mr. Alderson, chaplain to the West Riding House of Correction, Wakefield, 1833 to 1876. Her gift of poetry was secretly and carefully cultivated from early days, and she began when a young girl to write hymns for Sunday school festivals and missionary meetings in connection with St. John’s Church, Hull, where her grandfather, Rev. Thomas Dykes, was the vicar; but these early hymns are lost. Though she wrote many hymns, only 12 have been published, Twelve Hymns, by E. S. Alderson, neither date nor publisher’s name. For the last two or three years of her life she was an invalid, and died after much suffering at Heath, near Wakefield, March 18, 1889. (Hymns Ancient and Modern, His. Ed.) [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nALDERSON, ELIZA SIBBALD (DYKES) was the granddaughter of the Rev. Thomas Dykes of Hull and a sister of Dr. John B. Dykes. She was born in 1818, and in 1850 was married to Rev. W. T. Alderson, sometime chaplain to the West Riding Home of Correction, Wakefield, 1832–1876. She died in 1889 and was buried at Kirkthorpe. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n459 Lord of Glory, who hast bought us\n\nAlexander, Cecil Frances (Humphreys), 1823-95\n\nALEXANDER, CECIL FRANCES (HUMPHREYS), the daughter of Major John Humphreys, was born in Ireland, 1823. In 1850 she married the Rt. Rev. Wm. Alexander, Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. She wrote The Burial of Moses, which Lord Houghton called the finest sacred lyric in the English language. She was the author of several books of poetry, among them: Verses for Holy Seasons, 1846; Hymns Descriptive and Devotional, 1858; and The Legend of the Golden Prayers, 1859. She died at Londonderry, October 12, 1895. Mrs. Alexander was the author of many hymns, several of which have been widely used, e. g., There is a green hill far away.

D., was born in London, Oct. 7, 1810, and educated at Ilminster Grammar School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which he became a Fellow in 1834. In 1857 he was appointed Dean of Canterbury. He died January 12, 1871, and was buried in the church yard of St. Martins. His tomb bears the beautiful inscription, in Latin: “The Inn of a Traveller on his Way to Jerusalem.” His hymnological and poetical works were numerous. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nALFORD, HENRY, the son of the Rev. Henry Alford, Rector of Aston Sandford, was born in London, October 7, 1810. He attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was graduated with honors in 1832. Principal among his many positions and attainments are: a Fellow of Trinity, Hulsean Lecturer (1841—42), and Dean of Canterbury (1857–1871). While still very young, he wrote several Latin odes, a history of the Jews, and a series of homiletic outlines. Perhaps his noblest undertaking was his edition of the Greek Testament, the result of twenty years’ labor. This book, which was the standard critical commentary in England of the later 19th century and philological rather than theological in character, introduced in comprehensive fashion the treasures of German linguistic and exegetic studies to those unfamiliar with German. He was a member of the New Testament Revision Committee. The Contemporary Review was his creation and was edited by him for a time. His hymnological and poetical works were numerous and included the compiling of collections, the composition of original hymns, and translations from other languages. As a hymn-writer he added little to his literary reputation. The rhythm of his hymns is musical. The poetry is characterized not so much by depth or originality as by freedom from affectation, obscurity, or bombast. His hymns are evangelical in their teaching but somewhat cold and conventional. Though not a sacramentarian, his views and hymns were distinctively liturgical. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n461 Come, ye thankful people, come\n\n557 Ten thousand times ten thousand\n\nAllen, F. D., New York Selections, 1822\n\n249\n\nAlte Catholische Kirchengeseng, Köln, 1599\n\n113\n\nAltenburg, Johann Michael, 1584-1640\n\nJohann Michael Altenburg was born 1584, in Alach, near Erfurt. Having concluded his studies he was made teacher and precentor in Erfurt. In 1608 he became pastor of Ilversgehofen and Morbach; in 1611 in Trochtelborn; in 1620 in Gross-Sommern. All these places are in the neighborhood of Erfurt. During the war he fled to Erfurt. While there he heard the news of the victory at Leipzig September 7, 1631, and wrote this hymn, which is his best known production. In 1637 he became deacon of the church of St. Augustine, and the following year, pastor of St. Andrews of Erfurt, where he died, 1640. Altenburg was also a musician and composer. Landstad’s Hymnary does not contain Altenburg’s hymn, but it has been entered into the supplement to the American edition. It has been translated by Fr. Hammerich, a Danish professor, who died 1877. This fine Norwegian translation is found in Hauge’s Hymnal, in the hymn book of the former Norwegian Synod, and in Gustav Jensen’s Utkast til revideret salmebok for den norske kirke. The melody was originally used for a folksong: “Was wölln wir aber heben an.” As a hymn tune it was used for the first time in connection with a German hymn: Ain schöns neues christlichs lyed; item die, Zehen Gebot Gottes, 1530 (Nutzhorn). It has always been connected with the hymn, “Kommt her zu mir, spricht Gottes Sohn.” (Kom hid til mig enhver især, Landst. 576). The melody has found a place in nearly all the hymnals of the Northern countries. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nALTENBURG, JOHANN MICHAEL was born at Alach, near Erfurt, on Trinity Sunday, 1584. Educated at Erfurt, he was for some time teacher and precentor there. His pastoral charges included Ilversgehofen and Marbach, 1608, Trochtelborn, 1611, and Gross-Sommern, near Erfurt, in 1621. Here in Gross-Sommern this “devout, exemplary, and ingenious preacher” suffered many hardships during the Thirty Years’ War, which had just broken out. He was continually harassed by troops marching through, pressing the houses into service as their quarters, and plundering at will. At one time he was “host” to no fewer than 300 soldiers and horse. These troublous times finally forced him to flee to Erfurt in 1631 without as much as some bread to eat. Here on the news of the victory of Leipzig, September 17, 1631, and probably stimulated by Gustav Adolf’s password for the battle, he composed his best-known hymn. He retained his residence in Erfurt, where he died February 12, 1640. He was a good musician, composing tunes as well as writing hymns. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n375. O little flock, fear not the foe\n\nAmbrose of Milan, 340-397\n\nAmbrose of Milan is named as its author by Fulgentius, bishop of North Africa (d. 533), and also by Bede the Venerable (d. 735) in his Arte Metrica, and by Hincmar (857). The Ambrosian-Benedictian writers consider it genuine. It is named as one of the 12 hymns ascribed to Ambrosius. It was found in a manuscript from about 700 in the British Museum and in a large number of later manuscripts. It is found in almost all the breviaries of the Middle Ages. It has been discussed by Daniel, Mone, Wackernagel, by Cardinal Newman in his Hymni Ecclesiae, and others. It was used at matins and lauds on Mondays by Benedictines and others. There are 25 English translations extant. The version in The Lutheran Hymnary is by J. Chandler and dates from 1837. (For notes on Chandler, see No. 373.)\n\nAmbrose, the famous Church Father (b. 340; d. 397), was educated in the statesmanship of Rome, and in the year 374 he was appointed “consul” of North Italy. In Milan, where he resided, he became a great favorite with the people. Soon after his arrival there the office of bishop became vacant, and he was chosen for this position, in spite of the fact that he was yet an unbaptized catechumen. In this connection an interesting story is told. A violent controversy arose between the Catholics (Niceans) and the Arians concerning the choice of bishop, and Ambrose happened to appear. A little child exclaimed: “Ambrose shall be our bishop!” The assembly joined in the outburst. Ambrose protested against this action, declaring that he could not accept the office and fled from the city during the night but he lost his way and without realizing it, he came back to Milan. This he interpreted as a warning signal from God, and to the great joy of his people he accepted the office of bishop. Having given away his property and accepted Baptism, he now undertook the arduous task of preparing himself for his new duties through intense study. Dr. Olrik claims that Ambrose never became a learned theologian, while the hymnologist, Julian, refers to him as being a very able and prominent theologian. We shall not touch upon this any further, but two episodes in his life should be mentioned, because they throw light upon his position and his personality. When Empress Justina, who favored the Arians, demanded that he should permit them to use the churches, he replied that he dared not turn over to them what God had entrusted to him. When an imperial messenger threatened him with death Ambrose gave him a proud reply. The next year he declined an invitation to come to the court to dispute with the Arians. He replied: “It does not behoove the emperor to be a judge of doctrine, nor the laity to sit in judgment in matters of faith.” Ambrose was fired with zeal in the cause of the ministry of the Church. In his opinion the Church stood infinitely superior to the state. The moral worth of the state was due exclusively to the fact that it was the servant of the Church. The emperor now proceeded to send an army against the church of Ambrose. But the congregation flocked about their beloved bishop who gathered them for prayer and hymn singing. Augustine has pictured the overwhelming effect of the hymn singing on this occasion, and Ambrose himself mentioned this incident in his letters. Even the soldiers outside of the church joined in the song. The court had to yield, and Ambrose remained in power.\n\nA remarkable trait in the character of Ambrose is exhibited by the following incident. Emperor Theodosius had, during a riot in Thessalonica, been guilty of vicious cruelty and unnecessary shedding of blood. Ambrose sent the emperor a strong letter of reprimand and threatened to excommunicate him. When the emperor shortly afterwards came to the cathedral of Milan to take part in the worship, Ambrose met him at the door and denied him the right to enter the church until he had done penance for his crime. “Do you, who have been guilty of shedding innocent blood, dare to enter the sanctuary? Only after having through repentance and penance sought forgiveness and mercy, can you again with the congregation seek the blessing of the Lord and His Church.” The emperor went away, and at the following Christmas, eight months later, he came as a repentant and penitent sinner, returning to the church and was received by the bishop.\n\nAmbrose became the father of hymn singing in the Western Church. His love for church songs was a direct fruit of his intense devotion to his work among his people. He knew nothing more beautiful than the blending of the voices of the congregation m the common song of praise and thanksgiving to God. He succeeded in combining the more melodious Greek song with the more stern form of the Western Church, and by introducing responsive singing he secured the active participation of the people in the worship. This he accomplished by arranging the hymns in various rhythms so that they became better adapted to the needs of the congregation. The effect of this Christian song which with its intense life and steadily increasing power rang out from the Church of Milan, was majestically unique and bore its influence out into wide circles. Ambrose says in one of his sermons: “It has been said that people are carried away through my hymns, and I admit it, because it is actually true.” It will be noticed that this statement strikingly resembles the testimony which was given to Lutheran hymnography at a later date.\n\nAugustine, who with his mother Monica was present in the Church of Milan during the so-called “holy captivity” when many of the glorious hymns of Ambrose to the Trinity were sung, later describes the mighty impression made upon him through these hymns: “How mightily I was moved by the overwhelming tones of Thy Church, O my God! Thy voices flooded my ears, Thy truth melted my heart, the feeling of godliness burst forth, my tears flowed, a foretaste of salvation was accorded me.”\n\n“In the hymns of Ambrose,” says W. Wolters, “the firmness, the dignified bearing, and well directed zeal of the Roman are combined in such a masterly manner that they have weathered the ravages of time better than the most impregnable strongholds. And, while they have exerted their influence on numerous poets and have at various times been subjected to changes in meter and rime, they have still remained throughout the many centuries the inviolable source of a sacred inheritance.” Ambrose occupies such a prominent position in the history of church song that the hymns patterned after his style and written in the same spirit and tone are commonly called Ambrosian hymns. Ancient hymnology reached its culmination through his work. (Skaar, Söderberg, and others.) [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nAMBROSE OF MILAN was the second son and third child of Ambrosius, Prefect of the Gauls, and was born at Lyons, Arles, or more probably Treves. In 353, after the death of the father the mother and children went to Rome. Here Ambrose received the usual education attaining considerable proficiency in Greek. He studied law, as his brother Satyrus had, and soon distinguished himself in the court of Probus, the Pretorian Prefect of Italy. In 374 he was appointed Consular of Liguria and Aemilia, which necessitated his residence in Milan. Soon after, Auxentius, the bishop, died. The church in which the election of the new bishop was being held was filled with excited people, and Ambrose himself exhorted them to peace and order. Suddenly a voice exclaimed,—it is said that it was that of a child,—”Ambrose be bishop!” Immediately the cry was taken up by the mob. Although as yet only a catechumen, Ambrose was then baptized, and a week later, on December 7, 374, was consecrated bishop. The death of Emperor Valentinian I in 375 brought Ambrose into collision with Justina, Valentinian’s second wife, an adherent of the Arian party. Ambrose was supported by Gratian, the elder son of Valentinian, and by Theodosius, whom Gratian in 379 associated with himself in the empire. Gratian was assassinated in 383 by a follower of Maximus, and Ambrose was sent to treat with the usurper, in which he was fairly successful. But now Ambrose had to carry on against the Arians and the empress alone. Justina had to flee before the advance of Maximus on Milan and died in 388. Either in this year or the one previous Ambrose received the great scholar Augustine, once a Manichean heretic, into the church by baptism. Theodosius was now virtually head of the Roman Empire. In 390 a riot at Thessalonica caused him to give a hasty order for a general massacre at that city, and his command was but too faithfully obeyed. Ambrose refused Theodusius admittance to church until he had done penance for his crime. Only eight months afterward did the Emperor declare his penitence. Theodosius defeated the murderer of Valentinian in 394, and soon after the fatigues of the campaign brought his death. Ambrose preached his funeral sermon, as he had that of Valentinian. The loss of these two friends was a severe blow to Ambrose, and after two more unquiet years he died on Easter Eve, 397. Ambrose was great as a scholar, an organizer, a statesman, a theologian, and as a musician and poet. As a hymn-writer Ambrose indeed deserves special honor. Grimm correctly calls him “the father of church song.” Catching the impulse from Hilary and confirmed in it by the success of Arian psalmody, he introduced the practice of antiphonal chanting and began the task, which St. Gregory completed, of systematizing the music of the Church. As a writer of sacred poetry Ambrose is remarkable for depth and severity. He does not warm with his subject. “We feel,” says Archbishop Trench, “as though there were a certain coldness in his hymns and aloofness of the author from his subject.” He was not the author of the Te Deum.

ANTHES\n\nAntiphoner, Paris, 1681\n\n76, 548\n\nAquinas, Thomas, 1227-74\n\nThomas Aquinas, Thomas of Aquino, Doctor Angelicus, as he was called, was born 1227 at the castle Rocca Sicca, near the city Aquino, which was on the border between Naples and the Papal States. His father was Landulf, Count of Aquino. He was a nephew of Emperor Frederick I, and his mother was a rich Neapolitan countess. At the age of five years he was sent to the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino for his early training. He remained here seven years, after which he was sent to Naples to the university. Already as a child he attracted attention by his talents and deep piety. While in Naples he came under the influence of the teachers in the Dominican order and decided to enter this order. At the time when he sought to enter he was seventeen years old. His mother, who is characterized by Bishop Skaar as “a pious woman who with great care nursed the spark of spiritual life which had been implanted in him,” was opposed —as were the rest of the family—to this decision. They followed him, when he, on account of fear of his family’s wrath, fled towards Paris. At his mother’s suggestion he was captured, brought back, and held a captive for two years. It is told that his older and warlike brothers, urged by the “pious mother,” debased themselves so as to use any means whatsoever to turn his mind and heart from religion. Pope Innocent IV was instrumental in getting Emperor Frederick to step in and arrange some kind of a reconciliation. Then Thomas Aquinas returned to Naples. Later he was sent by his “Order” to Rome, then to Paris, and finally to Cologne, where he studied under the famous Albertus Magnus, who took him to the University of Paris. There he studied for three years and received the degree of bachelor of theology. He was appointed—then only 23 years old—professor in the newly established Dominican school at Cologne during the reign of Albertus Magnus. He taught, wrote, and preached to great multitudes. In 1248 he received orders to go to Paris again, this time to be examined for the degree of doctor of theology. Reluctantly he obeyed the request. Bashful and humble as he was, he shrank from thus seeking honor and distinction. But he went, begging his way. In addition to his studies he continued here industriously to write, deliver lectures, and preach. “No auditorium was large enough to admit all those who wished to hear him.” Louis IX appointed him member of parliament. He was then 32 years old. Not before 1257 did he receive his doctor’s degree. Pope Urban IV and later Clement IV offered him the highest honors (cardinal, archbishop, patriarch of Jerusalem), but he did not accept them. He was very much in demand as papal counselor and as leader in important commissions of the church. He was teacher in theology in the Dominican school at Rome, and besides delivered many lectures in various places. In 1272 he came to Naples to lecture at the university. He was given a royal reception by all. He remained here until 1274, when he received orders from Pope Gregory X to attend the second council of Lyons. On the way there he was taken ill and died March 7, 1274, barely 48 years old. He was a prolific author. His greatest work is his “Summa Theologiae.” “Thomas Aquinas was a man of thought, reflection, and prayer, filled with the conviction that through that light must be lit which should be a light for the spirit when the mysteries of the heavenly things should be searched out. When he, during his deep searching, could find no solution, he would fall on his knees and pray God for enlightenment. When he felt a warmth of encouragement in his heart he would continue his investigation. As a zealous and simple preacher he became very highly noted.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n321 Zion, to thy Savior singing\n\nArends, Wilhelm Erasmus, 1677-1721\n\nWilhelm Erasmus Arends was born February 5, 1677, in Langenstein.

Nothing is known about his early childhood and school days. We can infer that he possessed unusual gifts and ability from the fact that he became the palace chaplain in Copenhagen at the age of 21. In 1610 he took the master’s degree and became palace chaplain in 1613 at Frederiksborg, and then called as parish pastor to Nicolai church in Copenhagen in 1616. He did not remain here long, however, since he was called as bishop in March, 1618, to the diocese of Trondhjem. He was now 31 years old. Young and spirited as he was, he did not guide his actions into proper channels. He was very careless in his speech and life, and because he had a bitter enemy in a Danish official, who lay in wait for him and placed the worst construction on all he did, a complaint was started against him and he was accordingly removed from office in Bergen, 1622. He settled in Malmø, and the following year rendered the preparation of David’s Psalms, which, no doubt, were mostly composed in Norway, where the greatest number of them were circulated.\n\nKong Davids Psalmer sangvis udsat appeared in 1623 and is dedicated to the higher and lower clergy of Norway, to whom he wanted to extend a token of thankfulness for brotherly favor and fellowship as well as for other benefits.\n\nThe second edition of this work appeared in 1627, the third in 1650, the fourth in 1664, and the fifth about 1673.\n\nIn 1626 he was called as parish pastor to Vordingborg, where he labored until his death, in 1637. He was honored and loved by his congregation.\n\nHis tombstone bears the inscription found in Rom. 8:33, 34. While he was pastor in Vordingborg, he completed another great work entitled Hexaemeron, i. e., the world’s first week, six days of splendid and mighty deeds. This was a free rendering of a work by the French poet Bartas, a poem about the same theme. This appeared first in 1661.\n\nBoth of these made him an object of great admiration among his contemporaries. It should be remembered that Arrebo paved the way for later hymn writers. Without him, Kingo and other contemporaries would hardly have reached the point they actually did. The later ages that have benefited by his great contributions have not without ground referred to him as, “The father of Danish poetry.” He was the first to submit the Danish language to an artistic usage. Concerning his works Rudelbach says: “Arrebo strived to express every spiritual thought and word, as well as every original tone of the hymns. This renders his work of the highest value. No one since Luther who has sought to appropriate David’s and Asaph’s words and meanings has attained to the rank of Arrebo.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nAnders Christensen Arrebo is often referred to as “the father of Danish poetry,” for it was he who paved the way for later hymn-writers, such as Kingo and his contemporaries. He was born June 2, 1587, at Aereskobing, Denmark, where his father was pastor. Little is known about his early childhood. He became court chaplain in Copenhagen at twenty-one. He took his master’s degree in 1610 and became palace chaplain in Frederiksborg. In 1616 he was called as parish pastor to the Nicolai Church in Copenhagen. In 1618 he was called as bishop to the diocese of Trondheim, being at the time only thirty-one years of age. Unfortunately he did not guide his actions and speech properly, making an enemy of a Danish official, who had him removed from office in 1622. He settled in Malmø and began the preparation of Kong Davids Psalmer sangvis udsat, which appeared in 1623, dedicated to the clergy of Norway, in order to demonstrate his appreciation for benefits received. This book went through five editions from 1623 until 1673. He himself spent the remaining years of his life, from 1626 until his death in 1637, as parish pastor in Vordingborg. Before his death he completed another great work, Hexaemeron, or “the world’s first week, six days of splendid and mighty deeds,” which first appeared in 1661. It was a free rendering of a work by the French poet Du Bartas.\n\nArrebo was the first to submit the Danish language to an artistic usage.

He attended the schools of Ohrdruf and Lüneburg and at the age of eighteen had already obtained an enviable reputation as a composer, organist, and violinist. After serving for a while as organist at Arnstad and Mühlhausen, he was court organist and violinist at Weimar for nine years and in 1717 accepted the appointment as Kapellmeister at Anhalt Cothen. He finally settled at Leipzig in 1723 as cantor of the famous St. Thomas’s School and director o music in the St. Thomas’s and St. Nicholas’s churches, where his original composition were first produced in the regular services. Comparable to Palestrina in the Roma] Church, Bach wrote numerous cantatas and many motets, masses, and harmonization of old German chorales which have earned him the affection and admiration of th whole Christian and musical world. His immortal B Minor Mass and the St.Matthew and St. John Passions remain unsurpassed as combinations of the emotional and intel lectual, the mystic and energetic, in devotional music. Called “the father of modern music,” Bach certainly gave a direction to all the music of his age, for which th Church must be eternally grateful.

When he succeeded his father in the estate at Lew Trenchard, Devon, he exercised his privilege as squire and patron by appointing himself as rector there. Here he died in 1924. His energy and industry were inexhaustible and is said to have more works attached to his name in the catalog of the British Museum than any writer of his time.

While a boy, Joseph became chorister of York Minster, and later on he entered the Royal Academy of Music, London. For nine years he served as organist of St. Andrew’s, London, and directed the Barnby Choir. Later he had charge of the oratorio concerts; was director of the Royal Albert Hall Choral Society, and also in charge of the music department of Eton College, 1875. Barnby has composed an oratorio, Rebekah, and a cantata, The Lord is King, besides a large number of other compositions.

Charles Bragge (later Bathurst), was for some time member of parliament from Bristol. William Bathurst was educated at Winchester and Christ Church, Oxford (B. A., 1818). From 1820 until 1852 he served as rector of the Episcopal Church of Barwick-in-Elmet, near Leeds. In 1852 he resigned from the ministry on account of doctrinal differences. He died in Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, November 25, 1877. Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Use contains 141 metrical versions of the Psalms of David and 206 original hymns. Among his other publications may be mentioned: The Georgics of Virgil; Metrical Musings, or Thoughts on Sacred Subjects in Verse. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nWilliam Hiley Bathurst was the son of the Rt. Hon. Charles Bragge (afterwards Bathurst), sometime M.P. for Bristol. Bathurst’s name is often given as Bragge-Bathurst. He was born at Clevadale, near Bristol, August 28, 1796. His mother was Charlotte Addington; her mother’s name was Hiley. Bathurst was educated at Winchester and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating as B. A. in 1818. In 1819 he was ordained deacon and in the following year priest. In 1820 he was presented by his kinsman, Henry, Third Earl of Bathurst, to the Rectory of Barwick-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, and continued there as rector for thirty-two years. In 1852 he resigned the rectory because of conscientious scruples in relation to parts of the baptismal and burial services in the Book of Common Prayer. He retired into private life and first lived at Darley Dale, near Matlock, Derbyshire, where for eleven years he gave himself to literary pursuits. In May, 1863, he came into possession of his father’s estate when his elder brother died without heirs. He moved to Lydney Park soon afterward and there died on November 25, 1877.\n\nDuring his early years of ministry Bathurst composed hymns and versified a large portion of the psalms. These were published, 1830, in a small volume entitled Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Use. All but 18 of the 150 psalms and all of the 206 hymns in this volume are his.

He was the son of Baptist minister John Beddome. He was apprenticed to a surgeon in Bristol, but moved to London in 1839 and joined the Baptist church in Prescott Street. At the call of his church, he devoted himself to the work of Christian ministry, and in 1740 began to preach at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire. For many years he was one of the most respected Baptist ministers in western England. He was also a man of some literary culture. In 1752, he wrote Exposition of the Baptist Catechism. In 1770, Beddome received a MA degree from Providence College, Rhode Island.\n\nIt was Beddome’s practice to write a hymn weekly for use after his Sunday morning sermon. Though not originally intended for publication, he allowed 13 of these to appear in the Bristol Baptist Collection of Ash & Evans (1769), and 36 in Rippon’s Selections (1787). In 1817, a posthumous collection of his hymns was published, containing 830 pieces. Robert Hall wrote of Beddome’s hymns:\n\n“The man of taste will be gratified with the beauty and original turns of thought which many of them exhibit, while the experimental Christian will often perceive the most secret movements of his soul strikingly delineated, and sentiments portrayed which will find their echo in every heart.”\n\nHe died September 23, 1795, at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England. [The Cyber Hymnal]\n\n231 When Israel through the desert passed\n\nBede, The Venerable, 673-735\n\nwas born near the monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, which were founded by Benedict Biscop. Bede’s parents died when he was yet quite young, and so he studied at both monasteries under the tutelage of E;Benedict and later under Coelfrith, Benedict’s successor. At nineteen he was ordained a deacon by St. John of Beverley. Ten years later he received his priest’s orders from the same prelate. Bede’s whole life was spent in study; he divided his time between The two monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow. At the latter monastery, Bede, the scholar, grammarian, philosopher, poet, biographer, historian, and divine, died on May 26, 735. In the 11th century his remains were removed to Durham and reinterred in the same coffin as those of St. Cuthbert. Bede was a voluminous author on almost every subject. He translated part of the Bible into Anglo-Saxon. As historian his contribution to English history, the Historia Ecclesiastica, is invaluable. Among his works Bede lists a Liber Hymnorum. His contribution to hymnody is, however, not very great, for he contributed at the most 11 or 12 hymns.

During a long period of famine he came in 1574, with the help of a distant kinsman, to Vienna, where he remained for two years as private tutor. In 1576 he came to Strassburg, where he was cared for by Professor Johann Sturm, rector of the university. Following his father’s death in 1580, he returned to Lauban according to the wish of his mother. He was appointed assistant instructor in the city school, and during the same year (1581) he was ordained to the office of deacon of the Holy Trinity Church. In 1586 he became chief pastor of Holy Trinity. In this office he served for 36 years and was highly esteemed as an able preacher and faithful shepherd of souls throughout a long period of distress due to famine, war, and pestilence. He died February 5, 1622.\n\nBehm was a very prominent and prolific hymn writer. He produced upwards of 480 hymns. His hymns emphasize especially the sufferings of Christ, upon which he meditated throughout his life “in order to impress them deeply upon his own heart and those of others.” The greater number of his hymns were published in his Centuria precationum rhythmicarum, in three parts, Wittenberg, 1606, 1608, and 1615. Of the first two parts new editions were printed already in 1611, and all three parts were published in one collection, Jena and Dresden, 1658. A special selection of 79 hymns was published in Halle, 1857. Four of Behm’s hymns have been translated into English. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nMartin Behm was the son of Hans Behm (Böhme, Boehm, Behemb Behem, Boheim, Bohemus, or Bohemius), town overseer of Lauban, Silesia, where Martin was born on September 16, 1557. During a protracted famine in 1574 a distant kinsman, Dr. Paul Fabricius, a royal physician at Vienna, took Behm there. For two years Behm acted as a private tutor. After that he went to Strassburg, where he received much kindness from Johann Sturm, rector of the newly founded university After his father’s death in May, 1580, Behm, at his mother’s request, returned home At Easter, 1581, he was appointed assistant in the town school, and on September 2 of that year he was ordained diaconus of Holy Trinity Church. After his senior pastor had been advanced to Breslau, the town council kept the post nominally vacant for two years and then in June, 1586, appointed Behm chief pastor. During the 36 years he served, Behm became renowned as a preacher, as a faithful pastor i] times of trouble (famine, 1590, pestilence, 1616; war, 1619), and as a prolific author He was seized with an illness after he had preached on the Tenth Sunday after Trinity 1621. After twenty-four weeks on the sick-bed he died, February 5, 1622. Behm was a very prominent and prolific hymn-writer. He produced upwards of 480 hymns which emphasize especially the Passion of our Lord.

Sandell, 1832-1903\n\nDuring the so-called “New Evangelical Movement” in Sweden, in which the chief leader was the well known preacher, Carl Olof Rosenius, 1816-1868, great activity developed in the line of spiritual song writing. Rosenius composed many songs, all of which emphasized the central thought of his preaching, namely, free grace in Christ. Among those whose poetry was influenced by Rosenius, must needs be mentioned Lina Berg, née Sandell (1832-1903). She has written a large number of devotional and missionary songs which have become very popular in the New Evangelical circles. The devotional life of the individual and the joint realization of Christian brotherhood were through her given striking expression. As a rule, however, her songs have much in common with the intensely subjective, lighter Anglo-American revival and devotional songs. Only two of her hymns have been given a place in our church hymnals. Our present English version was rendered by the Rev. G. T. Rygh in 1908. (Concerning the melody, see Vol. I, No. 52.) [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n174 Children of the heavenly Father\n\nBerggreen, Andreas Peter, 1801-80, born in Copenhagen, 2 March 1801, died in the same place 8 November 1880, son of a comb-maker who emigrated from Stockholm. At age 10 he came to live with his mother’s father, the district doctor Lynge in Hillerød, in whose musical home he early displayed a keen sense for music. Afterward he was a student in 1819, he came to Regensen. The plan was that he should become a lawyer, but music possessed all his interest, and after a short time he discontinued and gave himself over to studying music. Yet he had no chance of regular instruction, so he had to work through it on his own. Berggreen was thus essentially self-taught. Weyse, whom he sought out, was to him more a fatherly friend and counselor than a genuine teacher. Berggreen felt continually strongly connected to the students. He rehearsed them in polyphonic singing and thus prepared the formation of a student singing grope, just as he was self-declared director of the cantors at the university’s second annual festival. Later he himself made an impression as teacher in connection with the younger musicians, among others his pupils were Gade and Heise. As a composer Berggreen performed in 1832 at the royal theater with an opera “Billedet og Busten”, with text by Oehlenschläger, to whom he strongly drawn both personally and literarily. Then he composed music for different tragedies and plays of Oehlenschläger and more. A whole list of cantatas and a number of solo and choral songs we have from his hand, just as he also made himself known as a writer (“Musikalsk Tidende” 1836 and a biography of Weyse 1876). Berggreen’s real significance, however, is connected to his meritorious work for church-, school-, and folk-songs. The work for these coincides with his positions as organist at Trinity Church (since 1838), as founder of the Haandværkersangforeningen (1843), as voice teacher at the Metropolitan School and finally as singing superintendent (since 1859). For the school he published 14 books of songs for use in school, in settings for 2, 3, or 4 voices. Collectively rich with great diligence, in part completely unknown folk-song materials he place in his 11 volumes a great collection “folk songs and melodies, patriotic and foreign, set for pianoforte” (second edition 1860-71). Finally, in 1853 he published a new collection of “Melodier til Psalmebog til Kirke-og Hus-andagt” (followed by an “Appendix” 1873), necessitated by the appearance of a new hymnbook by the Roskilde ministerium, partly older, partly with newer melodies, of which a great part are of his own composition. The time for the appearance of this collection of melodies was a time of transition, and the collection bears the mark of that. Berggreen took a middle position in that he to some degree tried to give the traditional church-hymn (“the chorale”) prominence and take notice of the “livelier” hymn melodies which were becoming more widespread under the influence of the Grundtvig side. In his own melodies the same is seen, that some are of one and some are of the other type. Many of them where he either had completely fit the churchly style or found a warm expression for religious spirit, he let them continue. [Kirkeleksikon for Norden, tr. MED]\n\n30, 339\n\nBernard of Clairvaux, 1090-1153\n\nThrough many centuries this famous hymn [O Sacred Head now wounded] has been ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux. It has been called The Jubilus of St. Bernard or Jubilus St. Bernhardi de nomine Jesu. Many parallels to this hymn have been found in Bernard’s Canticles (Canticum Canticorum). It was possibly written about 1150, shortly after the Second Crusade. St. Bernard had been instrumental in organizing this crusade and was therefore largely blamed for its dismal failure. Tired of the world, he withdrew into solitude. When everything thus seemed dark around him, his thoughts were turned more and more fervently toward Jesus, the light of life. Dr. Schaff in his Christ in Song calls this hymn “the most delightful and the most evangelical of all the hymns of the Middle Ages; the finest and most characteristic sample of Bernard’s poetry; a reflection from his Christ-like personality.” “The hymn,” says Landstad, “is not really intended as a communion hymn; the holy communion is not even mentioned in it. It is a love-song to the heavenly bridegroom, whose name is so dear to the soul that we cannot sufficiently praise it or bless it.” Therefore the hymn has been called Jubilus in nomine Jesu, Praise to the Name of Jesus or a Hymn of Praise Concerning the Name of Jesus. The thought dwells upon the crucified, buried, risen, and ascended Savior and expresses the desire of the soul, its sorrow, its seeking and its searching, it expresses its joy upon having found the Savior, and hope and prayer in communion with Him. Hence, the hymn has indeed become the favorite song of the Lord’s yearning and heavenly-minded bride, the Church, and is therefore especially adapted for use at the Lord’s Supper, which is the soul’s “love-feast” with the Lord. The hymn has been criticized on account of the seemingly monotonous way in which the ideas circle around the central theme. And this is true. But the theme of the hymn is the Lord Jesus. We are reminded of the small winged insects that swarm about an electric light, making continually smaller and smaller circles. Their desire is to unite with the light. They try to enter into the light. It is the center of all their longing and yearning. Thus, rightly considered, the criticism advanced against this hymn rather brings out the most praiseworthy characteristic of this unique Jesus-hymn. Concerning Bernard of Clairvaux Luther says: “If there ever has lived a truly God-fearing and pious monk, then St. Bernard was such a one, whom I rank higher than all monks and popes in all the world, and I have never heard or read of anyone that can be compared with him.”\n\nWe do not like to deprive St. Bernard of this hymn. But the authenticity of his authorship has long been called in question. And now, lately, Dom Pathier has found it in a manuscript from the 11th century, where the hymn is ascribed to a Benedictine abbess. St. Bernard was born 1091. The oldest of the manuscripts found hitherto date from the close of the 12th century. One of these is kept in the Oxford library. This contains 42 stanzas and experts have accepted this version as the original of this famous hymn. It is found in almost the same form in the Bodleian and the Einsiedeln manuscripts from the 13th century; also in one manuscript from the 15th century kept in the National Museum of Paris. The number of stanzas varies from 42 to 56. The form containing 50 stanzas was presumably used as a rosary hymn. The hymn has also been divided into several lesser sections for the various groups of the altar service. Thus, in the Roman breviary from 1733 and later: “Jesu dulcis memoria,” etc., for evening worship; “Jesu Rex admirabilis,” etc., for morning worship; and “Jesu angelicum,” etc., for lauda. As early as in the 16th century it was customary to sing several sections of this hymn at the festival of the Holy Name. Thus Paris Breviary from 1499, and the Hereford and Aberdeen Breviaries from 1505 and 1509 have “Jesu dulcis memoria” for the morning worship and “Jesu, auctor clementiae” for the lauda. For use at the canonical periods the hymn was divided into seven sections of about equal length.\n\nThere are, indeed, other hymns of which we have several English translations, but this hymn is quite unique in this that it has furnished the source for a vast number of beautiful hymns, Jesus-hymns. Versions of this hymn are sung throughout all Christendom, and it has been translated into all leading languages. A list of the various centos in the English language alone would fill many pages. The oldest German version, “Nie wart gesungen süzer gesanc,” is from the 14th century and contains 11 stanzas. Among the later German translations may be mentioned that by Martin Rinkart: “An Jesum denken oft und viel,” and N. L. von Zinzendorf’s, “Jesu, deiner zu gedenken.” Johann Arndt’s Garden of Paradise, 1612, contains a German version of 18 stanzas beginning with: “O Jesu süss, wer dein gedenkt.” A later edition of this work has another translation of 52 stanzas. The first Danish translation, comprising- 48 stanzas, is by Jens Jensøn Otthense, Copenhagen, 1625. This furnished the basis for Landstad’s Norwegian version (Landst. 66). [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nBernard of Clairvaux was born in 1090 at Les Fontaines in France, and he died at Clairvaux in 1153. He sprang from a family of the highest nobility in Burgundy. After a classical education at Chatillon-sur-Seine he entered the Cluniac monastery at Citeaux. When this became crowded, he led forth a band of monks to found a new monastery in Langres. This Bernard called Claire Vallie, or Clairvaux, in 1115. He was abbot of this successful monastery throughout his life, and with it his name has since been associated. This monastery became the scene of St.Bernard’s strict and zealous asceticism, and from this retreat his influence was extended over all that was illustrious or humble in Church or State. Bishops in England, the Queen of Jerusalem, kings of France, Italy, and Britain, abbots and ecclesiastics without number, wrote to, and received letters from, Bernard of Clairvaux. He rebuked the disorders, abuses, sins, prevailing in the Church, defended the inde­pendence of the Church against monarchs, and even dared to assert the interest of the Church against Popes. He settled the schism between the Popes Innocent I and Anacletus II, he fought down the heresies of Abelard, the rationalist, and by his preaching he caused the populations of both France and Germany to arise almost en masse and take up the cross in the Second Crusade. As Taylor says: “…for a quarter of a century he swayed Christendom as never a holy man before or after him. An adequate account of his career would embrace the entire history of the first half of the 12th century.” Luther called him “the most pious monk that ever lived.” The authorship of the famous Jesu, dulcis memoria has long been ascribed to him. This view is no longer tenable.

The im­posing festival services with the elaborate ritual were famed far and wide. The abbot of this institu­tion was the well known Peter the Venerable. Here Bernard spent the greater part of his life. It is not known at what date he died, neither do we know much more about him than that he wrote this famous poem, De Contemptu Mundi (On contempt of the world), which he dedicated to the leader of his order, Peter of Cluny.\n\nMany attempts have been made to render selections of this poem into a form more closely like the original than Neale’s and also in the meter of the original, but these do not seem to have gained favor. A few examples follow: [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nBernard of Cluny was born at Morlaix, France, of English parents. Except for the fact that Bernard entered the Abbey of Cluny while Peter the Venerable was the head thereof (1122–1156), little is known of his life. During this period the Abbey of Cluny reached the zenith of its wealth and fame. Amid luxurious and splendid surroundings Bernard spent his leisure hours and composed his great poem against the vices and follies of his age, De Contemptu Mundi, which was dedicated to Peter the Venerable. Bernard was also author of certain monastic regulations, entitled Consuetudines Cluniacenses.

His father was a member of the Hungarian nobility and served as lieutenant-colonel in the Austrian army. During his youth Carl was employed as a page at the court of the Duke of Weissenfels. Later he was sent to Breslau to be trained for military service. There he was stricken with serious illness, which turned his mind toward his God and awakened in him the consciousness that the Lord wanted him in His service. Count Heinrich XXIV of Reuss-Köstriz offered to support him with funds for his university course. He began his studies at Jena in 1713 and continued at Halle in 1715. Before Christmas he received a message that his mother had died and that he must come home at once. At a service in which he took part before leaving Halle, he gained, according to his own words, a clear understanding of the doctrine of justification by faith. His father disowned him because he would not enter the army, and at Easter time, 1716, he was enrolled as a student of theology at Halle. During his stay there he wrote “for his edification” his well-known work The Golden Treasury. His health failed and he suffered from hoarseness, which prevented him from taking up work as a preacher. But he spoke at private gatherings and produced a series of religious pamphlets. Among the latter may be mentioned, Concerning True Conversion. He wrote in all 411 hymns, which were published in 1771 in the third edition of Die Uebung der Gottseligkeit, mentioned above. A new edition appeared in 1844.\n\nBogatzky spent his last years at Halle. G. A. Francke gave him free sustenance at the orphanage. Years before Bogatzky had sold his property and donated the proceeds to the orphanage. He died in Halle, June 15, 1775. No. 710 in the American edition of Landstad’s Hymnal, “O Frelser, som er Lys og Livet,” was written by Bogatzky in 1725 during his visit with Duke Henkel of Pölzig, after having tried to find relief for his illness by taking treatments at the baths of Carlsbad. This hymn was translated into Danish by an unknown author. It appeared in Pontoppidan’s Hymnal of 1740. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nCarl Heinrich von Bogatzky was born September 7, 1690, at Militsch in Silesia. For a time he was a page at the ducal court of Weissenfels. At first he intended to enter the army, but sickness prevented him from carrying out this plan. He attended the University of Jena instead in 1713, and later he studied law at Halle. Finally he took up the study of theology; however, on account of poor health he was unable to enter the active service of the Church. He devoted himself to religious authorship instead. He spent most of his life in literary pursuits. The last twenty-eight years of his life were spent at the Orphanage at Halle, where G.A.Francke gave him a room. Among his writings are Das guldene Schatzkästlein der Kinder Gottes, 1718, which was recast in English by John Berridge as The Golden Treasury, and was long a favorite book of devotion in Great Britain. He also assisted in the production of the Cothen Hymns, as important for Germany as the Olney Hymns were for England. His Meditations appeared in seven volumes, 1755–1761, and his Autobiography in 1754. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n395.

Since the time of Watts, Wesley, Newton, and Cowper, no name occurs oftener than Bonar’s. He gave expression to the deepest and most heartfelt Christian feelings, as well as the most exalted strains of praise and thanksgiving. Bonar was born 1808, in Edinburgh. He completed the course of study in the high school and university. Thomas Chalmers was one of his teachers in theology. He was ordained to the ministry in 1837 and was called to Kelso on the Tweed, near the English border. During the controversy in the Church of Scotland, in 1843, Bonar, together with Dr. Chalmers and other leading men, left the old church and established the Scottish Free Church, with which Bonar was afterward affiliated. In 1866 he moved to Edinburgh, having been called to the pastorate of Grange Church (Chalmer’s Memorial). He was elected moderator of the Scottish Free Church in 1883. Dr. Bonar died in Edinburgh July 31, 1889.\n\nBonar was an exceptional man, a prominent preacher and author. His Kelso Tracts have been extensively circulated in England and America. The two works, God’s Way of Peace and God’s Way of Holiness, are widely read and have been translated into many languages, among others also into Norwegian. A list of his hymn collections follows:\n\n1. Songs for the Wilderness, 1843-44\n\n2. The Bible Hymn Book, 1845\n\n3. Hymns Original and Selected, 1846\n\n4. Hymns of Faith and Hope, Three series, 1857-61-66\n\n5. Hymns of the Nativity, 1879\n\n6. Communion Hymns, 1881\n\nBesides these he has composed many poems of greater length and many works in prose. About 100 of his hymns are used in England and America. Concerning Bonar’s hymns one hymnologist says: “They win the heart by their tone of tender sympathy. They sing the truth of God in ringing notes.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nHoratius Bonar was born in Edinburgh on December 19, 1808. In 1837 he was ordained in the Established Church of Scotland at Kelso. In 1843 (at the Disruption) he became a founder of the Free Church of Scotland. In 1866 he accepted a call to Chalmers Memorial Church in Edinburgh. A voluminous writer of sacred poetry, “the peer of Watts and Wesley,” he published ten tracts or volumes of hymns, 1843–1881, of which seven were published before his church authorized hymn-singing. He was for a time editor of The Border Watch, a paper published in the interest of his church. For many years he edited The Journal of Prophecy. Among his poetical works are Songs for the Wilderness, The Bible Hymn Book, Hymns Original and Selected. Dr.Benson writes: “While he may not have created a new type of English hymns, he had a distinctive style, a childlike simplicity and straightforwardness, a cheerful note with a plaintive undertone,—and he impressed his striking personality upon the English hymn. The appeal to his own generation was so widespread and pronounced as almost to create a cult. Fully a hundred of his hymns have been in church-use, but many are gradually passing out.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n239 I lay my sins on Jesus\n\n410 Glory be to God the Father\n\n433 Not what these hands have done\n\n451 All that I was, my sin, my guilt\n\nBook of Praise, Canada\n\ntr. 251\n\nBorthwick, Jane, 1813-97\n\nJane Laurie Borthwick, daughter of J James Borthwick, a merchant in Edinburgh, was born in that city the ninth of April, 1813. Her sister Sarah, born November 26, 1823, was married to the Rev. Eric John Findlater. Miss Borthwick and her sister published Hymns from the Land of Luther in four parts or series in 1854, 1855, 1858, and 1862. Besides translations from the German, they also wrote a number of original hymns. AS a signature of authorship they used the initials of the above mentioned publication, “H. L. L.,” and under this signature were written many of their own hymns, as well as translations in The Family Treasury. These were collected and published in 1857 under the title, Thoughts for Thoughtful Hours. Miss Borthwick died in 1897, Mrs. Findlater in 1907. This hymn is found in many English and American hymn books. (J. Mearns.)—The melody (Omnia) is composed by Joseph Barnby. (See Vol. I, No. 116.) Miss Borthwick has 9, and Mrs. Findlater has 5 translations in The Lutheran Hymnary. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nJane Laurie Borthwick was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on April 9, 1813. She and her sister, Sarah Findlater, won for themselves a high place in the useful band of translators. These two published their first translations in Hymns from the Land of Luther in four sections, of which the first appeared in 1854. She wrote also some original hymns, of which many were published in Thoughts for Thoughtful Hours in 1857. In 1875 she again showed her propensity for translating poems, for then she published a selection of poems translated from Meta Heusser-Schweizer, which she called Alpine Lyrics. She died September 7, 1897. Julian writes: “Her translations, which represent relatively a larger proportion of hymns for the Christian Life and a smaller for the Christian Year than one finds in Miss Winkworth, have attained a success as translations and an acceptance in hymnals only second to Miss Winkworth’s.… Hardly a hymnal has appeared in England or in America without containing some of these translations.” [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nAlleluia!

He studied music under Galuppi of St. Petersburg. Later he continued his studies in Venice. He served as conductor of the imperial choir of St. Petersburg and exerted a powerful influence upon church music in Russia. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nDimitri S. Bortniansky was born in the village of Gloukoff in Ukraine. He became a chorister in the Imperial Chapel at St. Petersburg, and there he studied music under Galuppi. In 1768 he followed him to Italy to continue his studies. Shortly after his return to Russia in 1779, he was appointed Director of the Imperial Choir at St.Petersburg, where he died October 9, 1825. He was a distin­guished composer of sacred music and has been styled by some the Russian Palestrina. He composed 35 sacred concertos in four parts, ten for double choir, and a mass according to the Greek rite. His works, published in St. Petersburg in ten volumes, were edited by Tschaikovsky.

He took holy orders, and in 1505 became a tutor of Hebrew at Ingolstadt. Here he remained until 1514 when he went to Augsburg, where he published a Hebrew grammar. In 1518 Reuchlin recommended that Böschenstain be invited to become a tutor of Greek and Hebrew at Wittenberg. At this university Böschenstain had Melanchthon as a pupil. Within the next three years he went to Nürnberg, Heidelberg, and Antwerp. He was also at Zurich for a short while, and here he taught Zwingli Hebrew. In 1523 Böschenstain settled in Augsburg, where he became a royal licensed teacher of Hebrew. He died in 1539. Some authorities state that he died at Nördlingen in 1540.
