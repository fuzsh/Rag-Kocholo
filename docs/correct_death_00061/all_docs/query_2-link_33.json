Norway also has the world’s largest museum devoted to one single artist, the painter Edvard Munch.\n\nHistorical museums\n\nNorway has a surprisingly long history and proofs of civilisation go more than 10,000 years back in time. All over the country, there are museums with collections that you will only find here.\n\nMuseums in Oslo\n\nOslo has several world-class museums, with exhibitions ranging from Viking ships to the newest contemporary art. Most places are easy to visit within a short time frame by foot, bike, or public transport.\n\nKid-friendly museums\n\nChildren are always welcome in Norwegian museums, but here you will find museums that are especially suited for the little ones."
