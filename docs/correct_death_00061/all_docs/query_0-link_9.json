EDITED BY PHILIP SCHAFF, D.D., LL.D., PROFESSOR IN THE UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. NEW YORK. ASSOCIATE E£JiP0ff£j, REV SAMUEL M. JACKSi^r\\£-AA.,s4£|fe> REY, ©ftSW SCHAFF. V0l?BM&4r NEW YORK: FUNK & WAGNALLS, PUBLISHERS, 10 and 12 Dey Street. Copyright, LSS2, by Fink & Wagnalls. EUctrotyfied and firinted by Rand, Avery, &• Co., Boston, PREFACE. n^HE object of the Religious Encyclopaedia is to give, in alphabetical order, a summary of the most important information on all branches and topics of theological learning, — exegetical, historical, biographical, doctrinal, and practical, — for the use of ministers, students, and intelligent laymen of all denominations. It will be completed in three volumes. The Encyclopaedia was suggested by the Beal-Encyhlopadie fur protestantisehe Theologie und Kirehe, edited by Drs. J. J. Herzog, G. L. Plitt, and A. Hauck (Leipzig, 1877 sqq.). This work, with which I have been familiar from its start, as one of the contributors, is universally acknowledged to be an invaluable thesaurus of solid information in all departments of biblical and ecclesiastical learning, under the responsible names of a large number of eminent German and other European scholars. The first edition, edited by Dr. Herzog alone, was begun in 1854, and comp1 ted in 1868, in twenty-two volumes. The second edition, aoroughly re- vised and partly rewritten, is now in course of publication, and will be completed in not less than fifteen volumes. A mere translation of this opus magnum would not answer the wants of the English and American reader.* While many articles are very long, and of comparatively little interest outside of Germany, the depart- ment of English and American church history and biography is, naturally, too limited. For instance, the art. Brilder des gemeinsamen Lebens has 82 pages ; Eherecht, 35 ; Gnosis, 43 ; Jerusalem, 37 ; Liturgie, 36 ; Luther, 36 ; Mandcier, 17 ; Manx, 36 ; Melanchthon, 54. These articles are all very good ; but a proportionate treatment of important English and American topics which are barely mentioned or altogether omitted, would require a much more voluminous encyclopaedia than the original. In the present work few articles exceed four pages ; but the reader is throughout referred to books where fuller information can be obtained. My esteemed friend Dr. Herzog, and his editorial colleagues, — the late Dr. Plitt, who died Sept. 10, 1880, and Professor A. Hauck, who has taken his place, as also the publisher, Mr. H. Rost, who issued the German edition of my Church History — have kindly given me full liberty to make such use of their work in English as I may deem best. It is needless to say that I would not have under- * A condensed translation of the first edition was begun in 1860, in Philadelphia, but given up with he publication of the second volume, and is now superseded by the reconstruction of the original. iv PREFACE. taken the task without a previous honorable understanding with the German editors and publisher. This Encyclopaedia, therefore, is not a translation, but a condensed repro- duction and adaptation of all the important German articles, with necessary addi- tions, especially in the literature, and with a large number of new articles by the editors and special contributors. More than one-third of the work is original. Every article is credited to its author, except the majority of editorial articles, which are unsigned. An apology may be due the German authors for abridging their contributions, but we have studied to give all the essential facts. Dissent- ing opinions, or material additions, are included in brackets. The bibliography has been largely increased throughout, especially by English and American works. Living celebrities are excluded. Denominational articles have been assigned to scholars who represent their denomination in a liberal Christian spirit. On im- portant topics of controversy both sides are given a hearing. It has been the desire of the editors to allow a wide latitude of opinion within the limits of evangelical Christianity. All important encyclopaedias besides that of Dr. Herzog, and a large number of books in different languages, have been carefully consulted, but never used without due acknowledgment. The assistant editors have devoted their whole time and strength to the work, in my library, and under my direction. I have been fortunate in securing the hearty co-operation of a number of eminent American and English scholars of different denominations and schools of thought, who can speak with authority on the topics assigned them, and will largely increase the original value of .this Encyclopaedia. Philip Schaff. New York, September, 1882. AUTHORIZATION. We the undersigned, Editors and Publisher of the \" Real-Encyklopadie fur Prot. Theologie und Kirche,\" hereby authorize the Eev.

A and &, or ALPHA and OMEGA, the combi- nation of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, is the phrase used three times by our Lord, in the Apocalypse, to set forth his eternity (Rev. i. 8, xxi. 6, xxii. 13). [The E. V and the received text have it also in i. 11, where the best MSS. omit it.] The idea is much older. In the O. T., Isa. xliv. 6 (comp. xli. 4, xliii. 10), Jehovah calls himself \" The first and the last,\" in contrast to the perishable idols. In both Testaments the phrase expresses the popular conception of eternity as endless duration, and at the same time the idea of divine causality; the Alpha looking back to the apxn, the begin- ning, the creation; the Omega, to the rekog, the end, the completion of the kingdom of God in Christ. Tertullian (De Monog. c. 5) and Prudentius (Cathemer. hymn. IX., 10-12 ') use the figure. Marcus the Gnostic discovered that the numeri- cal value of a and \" was equal to the numeri- cal value of the individual letters composing •KcpioTepa. (dove) ; whence he inferred that Christ called himself A and SI with reference to the Holy Spirit, who descended on him at his baptism in the shape of a dove (Irenasus, Adv. Haeres. I., 14,6; 15,1; Tertullian, De Praescript. c. 50). This trifling was employed by Primasius in his commentary on the Apocalypse (Bibl. Pair. Max.

The combination of a and \", by its simplicity and suggestiveness, commended itself as a sym- bol of Christian faith from the earliest times, and was used extensively on monuments of every description ; sometimes alone, but more fre- quently in connection with the monogram of Christ in its various forms : H\"05 Afc <3 % Sometimes the two letters, of which the o is almost always of that uncial form which resembles the minuscular, are hung by chains from the arms of the cross.

AA'RON (mountaineer, or, according to another root, enlightened), the first high priest of the Jews, eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi, brother of Miriam and Moses, husband of Elisheba, and father of Nadab, Abihu, Elea- zar, and Ithamar (Exod. vi. 20, 23) ; was the \" prophet,\" or mouthpiece, of Moses (Exod. iv. 16), and associated with him in all the preparations for and the actual conduct of the exodus and the subsequent wandering. By divine command he and his sons were set apart for the priesthood, and accordingly were consecrated by Moses (Lev. viii.) ; and the choice of Aaron as high priest was afterwards miraculously confirmed by the bud- ding rod (Num. xvii.). Aaron held the office for almost forty years ; and it then passed to Eleazar, the older sons having died at the hand of God (Lev. x. 1, 2). The most prominent defect in his character was weakness. He reflected the mood of those about him, and never acted inde- pendently. Thus he yielded to the solicitations of the people at Sinai, during the absence of Moses, and made the golden calf (Exod. xxxii. 4). He joined Miriam in her jealous murmuring against Moses (Num. xii.), and subsequently Moses in his impatient disobedience of the divine command at Meribah (Num. xx. 10). For this latter sin he was kept out of the promised land (verse 24). He died on Mount Hor, at the age of a hundred and twenty-three years, in sight of all the people, who mourned sincerely over his death. See Moses, Priest. fr. W. schultz.

AB'ANA (stony) and PHAR'PAR (swift), the \"rivers of Damascus\" (2 Kings v. 12), identified with the modern Barada and Awaj respectively. The Abana is the Amana of Cant. iv. 8, and probably the Greek Chrysorrhoas (golden stream). It rises in the Antilibanus, and runs through the city; while the Awaj rises in Ilermon, and flows eight miles south of Damascus. But their di- rection is the same, from west to east, across the plain of Damascus; and both empty themselves into the so-called \"Meadow Lakes,\" eighteen miles east of Damascus. -The Abana is the chief cause of the extraordinary fertility and beauty of the plain of Damascus.

ABAUZIT, Firmin, b. at Uzes, Languedoc, France, Nov. 11, 1679; d. in Geneva, March 20, 17CJ7 ; was educated in the latter city, and became public librarian there in 1727, having previously travelled and studied in Holland and England.

His La Verite de la Religion Chretienne, of which the two first volumes appeared 1684, and the third in 1689, was translated into English (London, 1694-98, 2 vols.) and also into German; and, though written by a \"heretic,\" it became one of the standard apologetical works in the French literature. Of his other works, his L Art de se Connaitre, 1692, giving an outline of his moral system, attracted much attention, and was warmly defended by Malebranche. ABBESS, also sometimes called Antistita or Majorissa, the superior of an abbey of nuns, was elected in the same manner as an abbot, and held nearly the same power. She. could not excommunicate, however, or give the veil, or ordain ; and thus she became, in a general way, more dependent of the episcopal authority than the abbot. That the Abbess of Lucia wore the title of Episcopa was an entirely exceptional case ; but her right to be present at councils and synods was generally acknowledged in the Western Church.

They were of two general classes, — royal abbeys, founded and endowed by kings, which rendered an account of their temporal administration to the kings offi- cers ; and episcopal abbeys, which were directly under the care of the bishops. Their jurisdic- tion was at first confined to the immediate lands and building in possession of the house ; but subsequently they very much extended their sway, even ruling over cities, and issuing coin, and acting as courts of justice. The abbeys of England, a hundred and ninety in number, and possessing lands valued in that day at £2,850,000, were suppressed under Henry VIII., and their property confiscated. Similar was the fate of the French abbeys in the revolution of 1790. See Convent, Monastery, Priory. ABBO of Fleury, b. near Orleans; d. Nov. 13, 1004. He was educated in the Abbey of Fleury ; studied at Rheims and Paris; went in 985, on the invitation of Archbishop Oswald of York, to Eng- land, where, since the days of Alfred, studies and learning had sunk so low, that very few priests understood Latin ; taught for two years in the school of Ramsery; was chosen Abbot of Fleury in 988, and brought the school of this place to a flourishing condition ; so, on the whole, he occu- pies a prominent position in this barren time which followed after the bloom of the age of Charlemagne. In the synod of St. Denis, 995, he took the part of the monks against the bishops ; and when the former aroused the peo- ple, and dispersed the latter, he wrote his Apolo- geticus in their defence. He was not a blind partisan, however, of the monks. He introduced severe reforms in the monasteries of Fleury, Marmontier, Mici, Saint-Pere de Chartres, and Reole; and it was the monks who in the last-men- tioned place roused the people against him, and caused the riot in which he was killed. His life, written by his pupil Aimon, is given by Mabillon : Act. Sanct. Ord. Benedt. VI. 1; his Apologeticus and a number of very interesting letters by Fr. Pithon : Codex Canonum, Paris, 1687. _ Many of his works, mathematical, astro- nomical, historical, and dialectical, still exist in manuscript. htjndeshagen (Heidemann). ABBOT (Greek wk^ac, Latin Abbas, Italian Abate, French Abbe, German Abt, from the Chal- dee or Aramaic form of the common Hebrew- word for father) was introduced in the East, first as a general term of respect for any monk, and then as a special title for the superior of a mon- astery. As such it was afterwards replaced among tbje Greeks by other terms, as, for in- stance, Archimandrite; and in the West it was retained only by the order of the Benedictines and its branches, — the Cistercians, Bernhardines, ABBOT. 11 ABBOTT. Trappists, Grandmontanes, and Premonstraten- ses ; while the Carmelites, Augustinians, Domini- cans, and Servites used the titles of Prcepositus or Prior Conventualis ; the Franciscans, those of Custos or Guardianus ; the Camaldulensians and Jesuits, those of Major and Rector, etc. In course of time the title was applied also to other cleri- cal, though not monastical offices ; and we find abbates castre?ises, preachers appointed for army service, abbates curia? palatii, etc. Another dis- tinction, not of title only, but also of position, was that between abbates regulares, seculares, and laid. The abbas secularis was not a monk, but a member of the secular clergy, holding an abbey in commendam ; that is, as a benefice, enjoying the honor of the title, and a certain amount of the revenues, but taking no part in the administra- tion or jurisdiction. From this system of giving monasteries in commendam arose the abbates laid. They were not only not monks, but they did not even belong to the clerical order. They were simply laymen, in the beginning warriors, after- wards courtiers. In the time of Charles Martel it was determined to employ monastic revenues, at least temporarily, for the pressing needs of the warfare against the Saracens; and the noblemen who led the troops raised in this way thus be- came titular abbots. But the patriotic purpose was soon forgotten ; and a practice grew up which finally, in the time of Louis XIV., became a public scandal. The abbas regularis was elected by the monks, and from among themselves ; only, in cases when a monastery seemed to present no fit subject, he was chosen from another congregation. Origi- nally the right of nomination rested with the 'bishop of the diocese ; but in the middle of the sixth century, during the reign of Justinian, this right was by law transferred to the monks throughout the Western Church, and the bishops retained only the right of institution. The sys- tem of commendation, however, and also other circumstances, gave both the bishop and the king manifold opportunities to interfere with the elec- tions. Once elected and confirmed, the abbot held office for life, and could be deposed by the bishop only with the consent of his fellow-pres- byters and abbots. With respect to discipline and jurisdiction, his power was almost absolute; and though the prceposili or priores nominated by himself, and the decani and cenlenarii elected by the monks, could exercise some influence, it be- came necessary for the councils to enact laws prohibiting abbots from blinding or mutilating their monks. In earlier times their power was somewhat checked by the episcopal authority ; but, in the beginning of the twelfth century, the Councils of Rheims (1119) and of Rome (1122) entirely emancipated them from the episcopal jurisdiction, and placed them immediately under the pope. In secular things, however, especially with respect to the abbey property, their power was often very circumscribed; and, as they were unable to interfere in person with civil suits, it often happened that the advocatus ecclesiaz or ozconomus or procurator usurped an exclusive authority over the administration of the reve- nues. There are, nevertheless, laws from a later date, prohibiting abbots from lending money on usury, limiting the number of their horses and attendants, etc. ; and the frequent rumors of de- bauchery and intrigue were not confined -to the abbates laid, but touched also the abbates regulares.

ABBOT, George, b. at Guildford, Oct. 19, 1562; d. at Croydon, Aug. 5, 1633; studied at Baliol College, Oxford ; was chosen master of University College 1597, and appointed Bishop of Lichfield 1609, Bishop of London a month later, and Archbishop of Canterbury within the lapse of a year. In 1604 he was chosen one of the eight Oxford divines who were intrusted with the translation of the New Testament, ex- cepting the Epistles ; and in 1608 he accom- panied the Earl of Dunbar to Scotland, to bring about a union between the churches of England and Scotland. In both cases he distinguished himself, but his rapid preferment was neverthe- less due as much to his flattery of James I. as to his merit. He showed considerable firmness, however, when once seated in the archiepiscopal chair, both in his relation to the king and the court, and more especially to Laud : he was even suspended for a short time, having refused to license a sermon preached by Dr. Sibthorp, which stretched the royal prerogatives beyond their con- stitutional bounds. Of his numerous writings, his Geography , or a Brief Description of the Whole World, ran through many editions; and his Ex- position on the Prophet Jonah (1600) was reprinted in 1845. A Life of him was published at Guild- ford in 1797. ABBOT, Robert, b. at Guildford, 1560; d. at Salisbury, March 2, 1617 ; elder brother of the archbishop, was, like him, educated at Oxford, where he became Master of Baliol College, and professor-regius of divinity. In 1615 he was made Bishop of Salisbury. He was a learned man and a prolific writer, following his brother's policy, especially in his opposition to Laud ; but most of his works, even his Mirror of Popish Subtillies (1594) and Antichristi Demonstratio (1603), have fallen into oblivion. ABBOT, Robert, b. about 1588; d. about 1657; was at once vicar of Cranbrook, Kent, and minis- ter of Southwick, Hampshire ; but, when parlia- ment decided against pluralities of ecclesiastical offices, he gave up the former benefice, though it was the larger. Afterwards he was made rector of St. Austin, Wattling Street, London, where he died. Though a strong churchman, and much mixed up in controversies with the nonconform- ists, especially the Brownists, he stands as a remarkable specimen of the Puritan type of clergymen of his time : and his prose writings were very popular; as, for instance, his Milk for Babes ; or, A Mother's Catechism for her Children, first published in 1646, and often reprinted. ABBOTT, Jacob, a popular American author, b. at Hallowell, Me., Nov. 14, 1803; d. at Farm- ington, Me., Oct. 31, 1879. He was graduated at Bowdoin College in 1820 ; student of theology at Andover, Mass., 1822-24 ; tutor in Amherst College, 1824-25 ; professor of mathematics and philosophy, 1825-29 ; principal of the Mount Vernon School for Girls, in Boston, 1829-34; ABBREVIATORS. 12 ABELARD. pastor of Eliot Congregational Church in Rox- bury, 1834-36 ; and since then he devoted him- self to literary work. He is mentioned here because of his \"Young Christian Series,\" con- sisting of The Young Christian, 1832; The Corner- stone, 1834 ; The Way to do Good; Hoary Head; and McDonner, — a series which has been exten- sively circulated. His numerous stories for chil- dren breathe a gentle Christian spirit, and convey valuable moral truths. ABBREVIATORS are notaries, or secretaries, of the papal court, whose duty it is to prepare condensations or outlines of letters, bulls, and consistorial proceedings. Their number is fixed at seventy-two; of whom twelve are prelates, twenty-two are lower clergy, and the remain- der may be laymen. Similarly named officers do the \"same for the acts of general synods. The office dates from Benedict XII., in the early part of the fourteenth century, and has been filled by distinguished men who held the rank of prelates. In 1466 Paul II. abolished it be- cause it had been corrupted, but it was restored later on. iEneas Sylvius, afterwards Pius II., was \" Abbreviator major\" of the Council of Basel (1430). ABBUNA, the special title of the metropolitan of Axum, or, as he is also styled, the Bishop of Abyssinia or Ethiopia. As twelve was the lowest canonical number of bishops for the establish- ment of a patriarchate, and the metropolitan of Axum was forbidden to have more than seven suffragan bishops, he was not a patriarch, but wore the above special title of Abbuna. He is nominated by the Coptic Patriarch of Alexan- dria. ABDIAS. Under the title, Abdice, Babylonia; primi episcopi, De Historia Certaminis Apostolici libri X. Julio Africano interprete, we have a collec- tion of myths, legends, and traditions relating to the lives and works of the apostles, and pretend- ing to be the Latin translation of the Greek translation of the Hebrew work of Abdias. An Abdias, however, Bishop of Babylon, and a disci- ple of the apostles, is not known to history ; and the collection, drawn from various sources, canoni- cal and non-canonical, catholic and heretical, is evidently a compilation from the eighth or ninth century.

ABECEDARIAN HYMNS are acrostic poems, in imitation of those in Hebrew, e.g., Ps. cxix., in which the several verses begin with the letters of the alphabet in regular order, and thus have the practical effect of aiding the memory. Au- gustine composed a hymn on this principle against the Donatists; and the Church employed also others, for all saw the importance of song as a means of religious instruction.
