Johan Christian Fabricius (J.C) By JC Clarke

Johan Christian Fabricius • Johan Christian Fabricius (7 January 1745 – 3 March 1808) was a Danish zoologist, specializing in "Insecta", which at that time included all arthropods: insects, arachnids, crustaceans and others. • He was a student of Carl Linnaeus, and is considered one of the most important entomologists of the 18th century, having named nearly 10,000 species of animal, and established the basis for modern insect classification.

Works • Fabricius is considered one of the greatest entomologists of the 18th century.[2] He was a greater observer of insects than his more botanically-minded mentor, Carl Linnaeus. Fabricius named 9,776 species of insects, compared to Linnaeus' tally of around 3,000. • Fabricius added two distinct areas to the classification system. He considers both artificial and natural characteristics. Artificial characteristics allow for the determination of a species, and natural allow for the relationship to other genera and varieties.

Works • The evolutionary idea of Fabricius are not as well known. He believed that new species could be formed by the hybridization of existing species. He also has been called the "Father of Lamarckism" because of his belief that new species can form from morphological adaptation. This agrees with Lamarck's Theory of Acquired Characteristics. • Fabricius was the first to divide the Staphylinidae (rove beetles), which Linnaeus had considered a single genus he called "Staphylinus," establishing in 1775 the genus Paederus. He also described 77 species of Staphylinidae.[9]
