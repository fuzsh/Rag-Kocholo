        "text": "This week my guest is Meredith Andrews, she is a singer/songwriter, wife, and mom to 3. You have probably heard several of Meredith’s songs including “Not for a Moment,” “Spirit of the Living God,” and several of the songs form the Belonging Co’s most recent AMAZING album. I was surprised to have so much in common with Meredith, and the season she is in spoke so much to the season that so many of us (moms especially) find ourselves in these days. Juggling the full time job of being a wife and mom, as well as pursuing God sized dreams, but also trusting Him in the waiting.\n\nMeredith talked about her journey to becoming a successful Christian music artist and how she attempts to balance her life with her family and this demanding career. She shed some serious wisdom about trusting God with your dreams and not forcing and pushing our way through to the outcome we think we want. I know you will love Meredith and our sincere and authentic conversation!\n\nLinks from the Show:\n\nMeredithAndrews.com\n\nFollow Meredith on Instagram\n\nThe book we discussed – Anonymous"
