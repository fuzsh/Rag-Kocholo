        "text": "So many of us experienced a stripping down and a refining process during COVID. But the beauty of our relationship with the Lord is that, as Meredith says in this episode of our devotionals podcast The Walk, when God brings things into the light, it is to bring them into fullness and healing.\n\n2 Corinthians 4, “Outwardly, we are wasting away yet inwardly, we are being renewed day by day, and these light and momentary afflictions are achieving for us an eternal weight of glory that far outweighs them all. So then we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. Because what is seen as temporary. What is unseen is eternal and God is inviting us into the unseen realm.”\n\nMeredith Andrews shows her depth of understanding of God’s Kingdom and our role in that Kingdom in this fantastic episode of The Walk. We do have authority and when we step into that, as God’s children, we can bring him with us wherever we go, and what an adventure it will be.\n\nPlease subscribe to our social channels for more information and great content surrounding building a lifestyle of worship.
