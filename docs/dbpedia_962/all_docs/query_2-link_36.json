If you don’t know Meredith Andrews, she is a wonderful worship leader, songwriter, and vocalist based out of The Belonging in Nashville, TN. Her husband Jacob is an incredible producer in his own right.\n\nAnd this interview covers the spectrum. We go deep into Meredith’s new project Faith and Wonder and discuss the heart of the project as well as talk production, how to create a great pad sound, keyboards, creative process, songwriting, and best practices for a live recording.\n\nSo good!\n\nClick to Listen\n\nShow Sponsor\n\nThis episode is brought to you by the Pads Live app from Coresound Pads.\n\nCoresound Pads are my favorite pad loops on the market. If you’re looking for a way to raise the quality and sound of your worship team, this is probably the easiest way to do that.\n\nAnd Coresound now has a powerful, easy-to-use pads-player app called PADS LIVE that helps you transform your worship service’s atmosphere INSTANTLY by downloading and playing their top-rated pad loops on the fly from your mobile device. This is an POWERFUL tool for worship leaders at any-size church.\n\nIf you go to PadsLive.com, you can link to download the app for FREE, which also comes with all of Coresound’s Pads in the key of D for free. You can let the pads loop infinitely, crossfade gently into the next pad or into silence, and build songs & playlists. And when you’re ready to unlock all 12 keys instead of just the key of D, you can purchase and download those pads directly within the app.\n\nNow the app doesn’t take promo codes, BUT if you buy a Pads Bundle online from Coresound and use the promo code BEYONDSUNDAY, you’ll get an additional 20% off your purchase. And your online purchase WILL unlock those very same pads within the app, as well as let you download the 20-minute MP3s to use the pads elsewhere.\n\nIn This Episode You’ll Hear More About:\n\nManaging the tension of parenting and ministry\n\nThe science behind pads\n\nWhat makes a great pad sound\n\nCreative process and productivity\n\nWhy Jacob & Meredith decided on a live project for Faith and Wonder\n\nSpecial moments from the live recording\n\nThe tension between pleasing your congregation and pleasing God\n\nBest practices if you want to do a live recording\n\nWhen to write a lot of songs and when to hone in your ideas\n\nWhy some great worship songs don’t work in your church\n\nResources Mentioned:\n\nShow Sponsor: Coresound Pads\n\nMusic: Faith & Wonder by Meredith Andrews\n\nPodcast: Meredith Andrews on Vertical Worship, Songwriting, & Balancing Family & Ministry\n\nWebsite: Meredith Andrews\n\nInstagram: @meremusic\n\nInstagram: @jacobsooter\n\nSubscription Links\n\nSubscribe via iTunes\n\nSubscribe via Stitcher\n\nSubscribe via RSS\n\nYour Feedback\n\nIf you have an idea for a podcast you would like to see, a special guest you’d like to hear from, or a question for an upcoming episode, please email me.\n\nIf you enjoyed the show, I would be so appreciative if you would rate it on iTunes and write a brief review.
