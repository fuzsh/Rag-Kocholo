        "text": "Christian recording artist, Meredith Andrews, has been a friend of mine for over a decade. We had so much fun connecting we kinda forgot you were listening. Meredith is one of the most down to earth people I know. She openly shares her relationship with God and all she is learning. Today we talk about the beauty in the hidden seasons. We’ve both been there. You may not think someone with such a public ministry would feel hidden. I’m so glad she shares about what she is learning. One thing is … even through it doesn’t seem productive or fruitful, God has a purpose for the wilderness. We also talk about how she met her husband, how she is inspired to write new songs and how she balances her busy career and family.\n\nA little more about Meredith – In 2011, she won two Dove Awards, “Worship Song of the Year” for “How Great Is the Love” and “Praise and Worship album of the Year” for As Long As It Takes. She has 5 studio albums. On a regular basis, Andrews leads worship at major women’s and worship leader conferences across the U.S., and has toured with Matt Maher, Natalie Grant, Big Daddy Weave, Vertical Church, Phil Wickham, and Michael W.
