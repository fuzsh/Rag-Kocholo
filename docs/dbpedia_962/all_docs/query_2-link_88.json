        "text": "Today worship leader, songwriter, and captivating vocalist Meredith Andrews has released her first song, A Million Saints, from her upcoming live EP Faith And Wonder (Live), which releases on March 8, 2019. Get the song and pre-order the EP here, and click below to watch the live music video of this song. On her first live EP, Andrews invites the world to experience a very special night of congregational worship that took place in downtown Nashville at her home church The Belonging Co. on September 26, 2018 for her upcoming live recording.\n\nIn anticipation of the upcoming release, Andrews will be releasing three singles digitally leading up to the six-song EP release. In addition to today’s song, next year she will release “Faith And Wonder (feat. Cody Ray Lee & Abbie Simmons) [Live]” on January 4th, 2019 and “Open Over Us (Live)” on February 8, 2019, leading to the full EP release in March.\n\nFaith And Wonder (Live) was produced by her husband, Jacob Sooter, who also co-wrote five songs on the EP. She also enlisted the help of her church family from the crew and production team as well as a large portion of the audience for the live recording making it a family affair. Co-writers of Faith And Wonder (Live) include: Meredith Andrews, Jacob Sooter, Phil Wickham, Mia Fieldes, Hank Bentley, UPPEROOMS’s Abbie Simmons and Cody Ray Lee, Bethel Music’s Steffany Gretzinger, The Belonging Co.’s Andrew Holt, and Vertical Worship’s Tyler Miller and Eddie Hoagland.\n\nThe debut single, “A Million Saints,” was co-written with worship leader Phil Wickham. True to the heart of the project, this song is about the global church, lifting one voice with one heart.\n\n“It’s a picture of heaven to me, all of us joining in and singing, ‘God, You’re holy,'” states Andrews about the song. “It’s not just about me or my community. It’s the church of the world, all nations and all generations singing the same thing, lifting up one name.”\n\nSource: Merge PR\n\nPre-Order Faith And Wonder"
