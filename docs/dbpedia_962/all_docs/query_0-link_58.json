        "text": "Episode #204 — She’d always loved to make music, and lead others into worship. But Meredith Andrews was really questioning whether it was time to set her music aside.\n\n“When my first son Maverick was a baby – probably 8 months old – I had been nominated for two Dove Awards. I was over the moon excited and honored! But I wasn’t able to attend the event that year. I was home, and I had just that morning had this moment with the Lord while Maverick was taking a nap. I was watching all these YouTube videos of these amazing female worship leaders, and I just thought, ‘God – I just don’t know if I’ll ever get to that place. Maybe you’re calling me to lay it down, and maybe you just want me to be a mom in this season.'”\n\n“I was weeping. I was crying. I was going, ‘God – are you finished with me? I just want to know. Just tell me, and I’ll be fine with it.'”\n\nIn that moment of searching, God provided some incredible clarity.\n\n“A few hours later, I got a call from my friend who was at the Doves and she said, ‘Meredith!’ And she’s whispering, ‘You just won a Dove Award! You just tied with Chris Tomlin for worship song of the year!'”\n\n“I’m not being modest when I say I shouldn’t have won! But then she calls me back five minutes later and said, ‘You just won another one!’ I’m like, ‘What is happening?!'”\n\nIt was an evening Meredith says she won’t forget anytime soon.\n\n“I just started bawling. Because God hadn’t forgotten about me. He was not finished with me, and He didn’t have to do that. But He gave me two gold birds to prove it!”\n\n“My identity isn’t tied to my calling. My identity is in Jesus, and what He says about me.“\n\nMeredith Andrews is the acclaimed recording artist, songwriter & worship leader behind the just-released EP “Faith & Wonder”.\n\nGet the latest episode of On the Road delivered straight to your favorite device when you subscribe on Apple Podcasts or Google Podcasts today!\n\nOn the Road with Meredith Andrews"
