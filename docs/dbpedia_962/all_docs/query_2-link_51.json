        "text": "I grew up in the humble farming areas of California surrounded by cornfields and cows. One of the perks of living here was places like Yosemite or the beach were all but a two-hour drive from our front door. I remember one night when I was 18 years old some of my music pals and I decided we’d like to go to the Monterey Jazz Festival and enjoy some really good music.\n\nIt was a wonderful night, not only did we hear some of the best musicians in the world play their hearts out but Starbucks was also giving out free samples of their new (at the time) Pumpkin Spice Latte! Some of the world's best musicians doing their thing and free pumpkin spice lattes all night long – that was pretty close to heaven on earth! Haha.\n\nThere was a problem however with drinking 8 or 9 Pumpkin Spice latte samples. About 45 minutes into our 2-hour drive home “Uhhhh… Hey guys… I need to use the restroom…” The only problem is we had not hit the 101 freeway yet and we were still out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by mountains, cornfields, strawberry patches, and a whole lotta nothing!\n\nWell… my friend driving kindly pulled over so I could step outside into a cornfield and use the restroom. It was pitch black with absolutely no light at all except for the stars… And then the worst thing possible happened. My fellow teenage buddies decided it would be a wonderful idea to drive off and leave me there stranded as a joke.\n\nWhat makes this worse is the Mel Gibson film “Signs” had just come out and I had recently watched it. Being left stranded like that in a cornfield after having just watched that movie is a lot for an 18-year-old. Hahaha, I was scared to death, I will never forget it. But you know, something really cool happened at that moment. I spoke the name of Jesus and immediately felt the presence of God with me.\n\nHallelujah, even though my friends (jokingly) had left me stranded, I was not alone and I knew it. All of the sudden darkness felt like light, fear turned to courage, and a lamb became a lion. God’s promise of being our Good Shepherd is for real and it is available for all who choose to follow Him — and what happens in the reality of His nearness is a miracle!\n\nEven though I had just felt fear a moment before I suddenly felt comfort, nearness to God, and total peace. This is both the mystery and miracle of the Holy Spirit with us.\n\nI want to close with Psalm 23, and as you read it know that you are reading the Truth of God's word, an enduring promise that never changes:\n\n“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”\n\nHallelujah, I am not alone. Amen.\n\nPhil King Bio\n\nPhil King is fervent about leading and writing songs that bring many people to Jesus. Over the course of his life Phil has used his genre fluid sound, soulful voice, love for God, and heart for the Church to invite a diverse people to experience God.\n\nKing is the launch artist for newly formed label, Euphonic City, co-founded by two of his long-time mentors and friends, Paul Wright and Jennie Lee Riddle. He has been working on his fifth record which is a timely and rich gathering of songs for his Euphonic City debut. This release of Phil King will begin with 5 singles, culminating with a 14 track album featuring many of his family friends.\n\nIn his early 20’s he became the worship leader at Christ for the Nations in Dallas, TX before taking a position as a worship pastor at Gateway Church. Most recently, King moved he and his wife to Amarillo, Texas to join Trinity Fellowship Church where they have started their family and are now raising their young twins.\n\nPhil has written multilingual anthems such as “So Worthy'' that have traveled far and wide. And notably, for the pro-life movement, “Not Forgotten” was performed by Phil and Francesca Battistelli at a Focus on the Family event, “Alive From New York” in Times Square attended by 20,000. King often leads at conferences and worship experiences. He has sung and played on records and live events for artists that include Michael W. Smith, Danny Gokey, Charity Gayle, Lauren Daigle, and others. His songwriting credits include Leeland, Matt Redman, Micah Tyler, Christine D’Clario, Rtia Springer, and more. But most of all, Phil’s favorite thing is to be available to the men and women of God who carry the Gospel to the furthermost regions of the earth. In Phil’s own words, “I love the harvest field!”"
