        "text": "published on 2012-08-13T15:10:09Z\n\nThis is Meredith Andrews and I just wanted to share the story behind my song, âNot For A Moment.â I wrote this song with my husband, Jacob, and our dear friend Mia Fields and I remember just sitting in a room in Nashville as we sat down to write a song and talking about the constant faithfulness and goodness of God and the fact that He is Sovereign in every detail of our lives. We all got pretty emotional as we reminded ourselves that God is who He says He is and He is with us every moment of our lives even when we donât feel that that is true. Well shortly after writing âNot For A Moment,â Jacob and I walked through a really hard season with both of our families. We experienced loss and heartache and Iâm pretty sure we asked the Lord âwhyâ at least a thousand times, yet He remained constant and good and sovereign and as we walked through those dark days He brought these lyrics to our minds and hearts. From the bridge of âNot For A Momentâ which says, âEvery step, every breath You are there, every tear, every cry, every prayer. In my hurt, at my worst, when my world falls down not for a moment will you forsake me.â The Lord used this new song to remind Jacob and me of His faithfulness when it was hardest to see it. And it is a song of faith, learning to take God at His word and choosing to believe that He is good even when weâre suffering. The truth is He is the only thing that is constant, the only thing that will never change and no matter what weâre walking through we can rest assured that He will not forsake us, not for a moment. I pray this song has reminded you of the faithfulness and goodness of the Lord today. He is right there with you."
