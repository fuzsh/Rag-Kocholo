        "text": "Word Worship recording artist Meredith Andrews’ latest single “Open Up The Heavens,” impacting radio on March 7, attracted early attention with 25 stations adding it in its first week. The track, co-written by Andrews, Stu Garrard, Jason Ingram, James McDonald and Andi Rozier, marks the fourth release from her Dove Awards-nominated album Worth It All. This spring, the two-time Dove Award winner will embark on “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014,” slated to hit 17 cities from March 20-April 13. The two-hour live event, a joint partnership between Word Entertainment and LightWorkers Media (Mark Burnett and Roma Downey), brings the feature film “Son of God” and epic mini-series “The Bible” to life in sight and sound with award-winning artists Francesca Battistelli, Sidewalk Prophets, Natalie Grant, Chris August and Jason Gray. In 2014, Andrews is also engaged to perform and lead worship at national conferences including all 2014 National Worship Leader Conferences, the Evangelical Press Association conference, MOP’s (Mothers of Preschoolers) MOMcon and multiple national women’s events.\n\n“‘Open Up The Heavens’ is a song that we at our church open up the service with and just say ‘God have your way. Do what you want to do here and show us your glory,’” said Andrews on her latest offering to radio, a song that’s been impacting church services since its inception in December 2011. “My pastor, James MacDonald, did a sermon series talking about the glory of God and how we were made for that. Sometimes we just get distracted when really it’s about seeking the Lord, seeing the arms of the Lord and then running after Him and wanting more of Him and His glory. ‘Lord show us your glory’ is a big theme in our church and it is a prayer in my own heart as well.”\n\n“Open Up The Heavens” has critics raving with NewReleaseTuesday’s Kevin Davis, who selected Andrews’ latest album as his top worship album of 2013 noting “[Open Up The Heavens] beautifully set[s] the tone for this 5 star masterpiece with her signature powerful vocals and worship filled lyrics.” JesusFreakHideout follows step adding “One listen to ‘Open Up The Heavens’ … is enough to lodge the chorus in the listener’s mind. The lyrics themselves… are well thought-out and Christ-centric, honoring God’s steadfastness.”\n\nUpcoming 2014 Appearances:\n\n3/20 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Lake Forest, CA – Saddleback Church\n\n3/21 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Phoenix, AZ – Vineyard Church\n\n3/22 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Albuquerque, NM – Legacy Church\n\n3/23 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Denver, CO – Denver First Church of the Nazarene\n\n3/27 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Austin, TX – Riverbend Church\n\n3/28 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Dallas, TX – Sunnyvale First Baptist Church\n\n3/29 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Tulsa, OK – Mabee Center\n\n3/30 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Kansas City, MO – Lenexa Christian Center\n\n4/3 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Columbus, OH – Grace Polaris Church\n\n4/4 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Grand Rapids, MI – Grand Rapids First\n\n4/5 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Chicago, IL – Olivet Nazarene University\n\n4/6 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Nashville, TN – Allen Arena\n\n4/9 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Pittsburgh, PA – Amplify Church – East\n\n4/10 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Pittsburgh, PA – Victory Family Church\n\n4/11 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Louisville, KY – Northside Christian Church\n\n4/12 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Lynchburg, VA – Thomas Road Baptist Church\n\n4/13 “The Bible: SON OF GOD Tour 2014” – Baltimore, MD – Hartford Community College\n\n4/26 “Ladies Day 2014” – Bourbonnais, IL – Olivet Nazarene University\n\n5/4-6 “Evangelical Press Association Conference” – Anaheim, CA – Sheraton Park Hotel\n\n5/14 “National Worship Leader Conference” – Centreville, VA – Centreville Baptist Church\n\n5/15 Dinner & Concert Fundraiser – Bangor, ME – Spectacular Events Center\n\n6/17 “National Worship Leader Conference” – San Jose, CA – Cathedral of Faith\n\n6/23 “SONPOWER 2014” – Orlando, FL – Doubletree\n\n7/16 “National Worship Leader Conference” – Leawood, KS – Church of the Resurrection\n\n10/2-4 “MOMcon” – Louisville, KY – Louisville Convention Center\n\n10/9 “Apprentice 2014 National Conference” – Wichita, KS – Friends University\n\n11/14-15 “Fresh Grounded Faith” – Jonesboro, AR – Central Baptist Church"
