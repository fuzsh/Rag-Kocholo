It ultimately sold for £18.5 million ($25.3 million), more than tripling its presale high estimate of £6 million ($8.1 million), and setting a new auction record for a Banksy. That price represents a nearly 17-fold jump from the just-over £1 million ($1.3 million) the piece previously fetched at the infamous 2018 auction.\n\nBanksy’s market gained new momentum after that sale three years ago. On Artsy, the number of collectors inquiring about the secretive artist’s work surged 175% the month of the shredding. At the time, Love is in the Bin’s £1 million ($1.3 million) was the second-highest price achieved by a Banksy work on the secondary market; three years later, it is his 25th-highest auction result.\n\nLove is in the Bin’s journey is far from over. Speculation about the new buyer’s identity (Sotheby’s said it went to an Asian collector) and where the work will appear next began immediately after the gavel came down. The seller’s identity is also still a mystery—Sotheby’s only said it was a “private European collector,” while a museum that exhibited the work in 2019 said it was on loan from an unnamed European woman. But today’s sale caps a remarkable three-year circuit for the work, and Artsy has been following along every step of the way. Here, from our past coverage, is everything you need to know about the shredded Banksy:\n\n“An artwork by Banksy shredded itself after selling for $1.3 million at Sotheby’s.”\n\n“Is That Banksy Worth More Now That It’s Shredded? We Asked the Experts”\n\n“McDonald’s, Perrier, and other brands appropriated Banksy’s shredded painting for ads.”\n\n“Banksy proclaims shredded canvas is a new work dubbed ‘Love is in the Bin.’”\n\n“Banksy revealed that a malfunctioning shredder stopped his painting from being completely destroyed.”\n\n“Banksy Market Accelerates Following Shredding Stunt”\n\n“Banksy’s half-shredded painting will go on view at a German museum.”\n\n“Banksy’s shredded painting will be on long-term loan to a museum in Stuttgart.”\n\n“The 6 Most Iconic Works by Banksy”"
