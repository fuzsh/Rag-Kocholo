Do your friends and family sometimes blow you off and make you feel like you’re not worth their time? Do you ever feel abandoned?\n\nWe’ve all been there at some point. I’ve played this song over about a dozen times this morning…and not because it’s new and I’m just getting to know it. I love this song because it touches the place in my heart that needs reassurance. It reminds me of what I already know: God is always with me, and He’s on my side.\n\nGod is on your side, and wants you to trust Him. He’ll never abandon you.\n\nYou’re Not Alone\n\nI searched for love\n\nWhen the night came and it closed in\n\nI was alone\n\nbut you found me where I was hiding\n\nand now I’ll never ever be the same\n\nIt was the sweetest voice that called my name\n\nsaying\n\nYou’re not alone\n\nfor I am here\n\nlet me wipe away your every fear\n\nMy love, I’ve never left your side\n\nI have seen you through the darkest night\n\nand I’m the one who’s loved you all your life\n\nAll of your life\n\nYou cry yourself to sleep\n\ncause the hurt is real\n\nand the pain cuts deep\n\nAll hope seems lost\n\nWith heartache your closest friend\n\nand everyone else long gone\n\nYou’ve had to face the music on your own\n\nbut there is a sweeter song that calls you home\n\nsaying\n\nYou’re not alone\n\nfor I am here\n\nlet me wipe away your every tear\n\nMy love, I’ve never left your side\n\nI have seen you through the darkest night\n\nAnd I’m the one who’s loved you all your life\n\nAll your life\n\nFaithful and true… Forever\n\nFor my love will carry you…\n\nYou’re not alone\n\nfor I… I am here\n\nlet me wipe away your every fear… Oh yeah\n\nMy love, I’ve never left your side\n\nI have seen you through your darkest night\n\nYour darkest night\n\nAnd I’m the one who’s loved you all your life\n\nAll of your life\n\nJoin me on Substack!"
