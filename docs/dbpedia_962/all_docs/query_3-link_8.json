        "text": "Art Deco was an international decorative style than ran from 1919 to 1939. Known initially as \"le style moderne\" or \"Jazz Moderne,\" the style received its current name in 1968, during a period of scholarly reappraisal. Art Deco developed first in France, and attracted international notice through a government-sponsored exposition held in 1925. The exciting array of works on display included a wide range of avant-garde, luxurious, and lighthearted artistic modes.\n\nAfter 1925, designs increasingly reflected the rapid artistic and technological innovations of the period between two world wars, incorporating chic elegance, eclectic historical and national imagery, and Machine Age forms into an effervescent decorative vision. Art Deco originated in a time of intense aesthetic experimentation; art movements such as the Bauhaus, Constructivism, Cubism, De Stijl, Futurism, Orphism, and Surrealism helped define the style's inherent modernism.\n\nArt Deco design exemplified opulent consumption, crass commercialism, and the acceleration of contemporary life summed up in the Futurist credo \"Speed is beauty.\" Art Deco's greatest achievement, however, came in its mature phase, when designers liberated the machine from long-standing artistic contempt.\n\nThe Art & Architecture Collection has excellent holdings of primary resource materials on Art Deco, including pattern books, design manuals, and catalogues from the original Paris Exposition of 1925. Many secondary resource materials are also available in the Library collections, from monographs on art, architecture, and design to survey histories of the period.\n\nUsing the Library's Catalog\n\nWhen searching the Library's catalog, be aware that it uses subject heading terms from The Library of Congress Subject Headings. As a result, there is a direct subject heading for Art Deco architecture:\n\nArt Deco (architecture)\n\nTo search Art Deco as a narrower term try:\n\nDecoration and Ornament -- Art Deco\n\nAlso, geographic subdivisions can be used, as in:\n\nArt Deco -- France\n\nOne can also research Art Deco exhibitions:\n\nArt Deco -- catalogues\n\nArt Deco -- collectors and collecting\n\nArt Deco -- exhibitions\n\nArt Deco -- bibliography\n\nRelated headings of use may be:\n\nFrance -- Social life and customs -- 20th century\n\nNew York -- Social life and customs -- 20th century\n\nSurvey Histories\n\nThese titles provide overviews to the time period and offer social contexts for the development of the Art Deco style.\n\nGeneral Reference\n\nMargulies, Phillip, ed.

Illustrations from many of these publications were richly rendered in the pochoir technique. A form of printmaking, pochoir artists used a pain-staking hand-applied process involving gouache watercolor and stencil plates.\n\nThe following are a sample of the various plate books to be found in the Art and Architecture Collection:\n\nBenedictus, Edouard.
