Meredith is from a new wave of worship orientated female artists who have made inroads into US Christian radio and this, the singer's third album, has all the top rate musicianship and slick production values you'd expect from the hit-making team Jason Ingram and Rusty Varenkamp. The absolute standout song here is 'My Soul Sings' written by Meredith, Jason, and Stu Gerrard, though two or three of the others, like the perky opener, 'Never Move On' and the duet with worship veteran Paul Baloche 'How Great Is The Love' are also memorable moments. If you're looking for worship music with a touch of Euro/synth influence and a singer with plenty of warmth and expressiveness in her voice, then "As Long As It Takes" is recommended.
