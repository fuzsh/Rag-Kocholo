        "text": "Gene Kelly’s widow shares heart-warming note from wedding\n\nCyd Charisse returned to the nation’s screens in ‘The Band Wagon’, which aired on BBC Two at the weekend. This classic backstage musical, released in 1952, features Charisse in one of the best performances of her career. The American dancer — who had ‘million-dollar legs’ — plays ballerina Gabrielle Gerard, who is drafted in for a floundering Broadway production. Charisse shares the screen with fellow Hollywood legend Fred Astaire, whose character Tony Hunter struggles to keep up with the modern musical he is supposed to be leading.\n\nOne of the highlights of Vincente Minnelli’s film is Charisse and Astaire partnering up for the ‘Dancing in the Dark’ sequence.\n\nSet against the city skyline at night, the iconic scene was Gene Kelly’s own favourite Astaire number.\n\nCharisse danced with Astaire and Kelly during her long career, performing with both men in a string of classic films.\n\nHowever, the latter had a more forceful approach with his partners, according to The Week’s obituary of Charisse.\n\nIt read: “Charisse performed memorably with both Kelly and Astaire again, in Brigadoon (1954) and Silk Stockings (1957), respectively.\n\nJUST IN: Dean Martin's multimillion fortune over long career — and mystery over who he left it to\n\n“Kelly, she found, was rougher than Astaire. ‘If I was black and blue, it was Gene. And if it was Fred, I didn’t have a scratch’.”\n\nDespite the two men’s differing styles, Charisse was complementary about both of her dancing partners.\n\nShe once said: “To sum it up, I’d say they were the two greatest dancing personalities who were ever on screen.\n\n“But it’s like comparing apples and oranges. They’re both delicious.”\n\nCharisse was said to have caught the eye of both men with her performance in ‘Ziegfeld Follies’.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
