        "text": "A fascinating holiday event blends the glamour of old Hollywood and a remarkable love story with modern-day reflections. \" \" is playing in partnership with The Seattle Symphony on Dec. 14 and 15.\n\nThe anticipated event will feature an intimate live one-woman show at Benaroya Hall with Kelly’s widow and biographer, Patricia Ward Kelly. The show is filled with insightful stories about the Hollywood legend and the man who holds her heart.\n\nAn iconic actor, singer, dance innovator, director, and choreographer, Gene Kelly is the epitome of the Golden Age of Hollywood. He popularized many MGM studio musicals of the 1940s and 50s. His iconic films such as \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"An American in Paris\", and \"Cover Girl\" have stood the test of time, and continue to inspire and impact new generations of people. Kelly is also known to have acted opposite some of Hollywood's most prominent leading ladies, such as Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse, and Leslie Caron. Kelly also went on to receive numerous accolades throughout his lifetime, including multiple lifetime achievement awards and an Honorary Academy Award in 1952.\n\nShowcasing his versatile artistic abilities, Kelly also took on duties as director and choreographer for various films, including MGM’s 1949 technicolor musical “On the Town,” starring Gene and notably featuring Frank Sinatra, Vera- Ellen, and Ann Miller. Kelly would also go on to co-direct 1952’s \"Singin’ in the Rain,\" lauded by many critics as the \"best musical ever made.\"\n\nInitially meeting in 1985, Patricia met Gene while working as a writer for a television special in which Gene was hosting. Reflecting on their initial meeting, she gives us insight during that particular time, \"I was a very nerdy Herman Melville scholar and had gone to graduate school at the University of Virginia. I had worked in Chicago at the Melville Collection at the Newberry Library and helped in the editing of Melville's authoritative texts,\" she said. \"There weren't a lot of women in the field, and it was really the kind of deep intensive research that I love. And I read Melville's manuscripts and looked at his handwriting and got hired to write a documentary about him for public television,\" she adds.\n\nSoon, Patricia got hired to work on other projects, including a 90-minute television special about the Smithsonian Museum, “I was initially brought in as a researcher, and the host narrator was to be Gregory Peck and I did know who he was. But at the last minute, they said that it was going to be someone named Gene Kelly and I didn’t know who that was. So, the grand irony is that I was the only person in the room who didn't know who Gene was, and the women were so determined to get a marriage proposal out of him that the director decided to put me in the room with Gene to keep all of the other women away. I think that was a benefit, (not knowing who he was) because he never really encountered that and he was kind of amused,” Patricia recalls. “By the end of the week, I was completely enchanted because he was the true Renaissance Man as he spoke French, Italian, Yiddish, and also read Latin and wrote poetry. He was also drop-dead gorgeous and just a real gentleman,” she adds.\n\nTheir romance blossomed and Patricia and Gene eventually married in 1990, and stayed together until his passing in 1996. Over the course of their relationship, Patricia had the opportunity to assist in writing his potential memoir since their initial 1985 meeting,\n\n“I recorded him in some format nearly every day for over ten years,” she said. Patricia also hopes to one day complete the memoir.\n\nReflecting further on their relationship, Patricia recalls many lovely and historic moments with Gene as they dined with many stars from classic Hollywood, including having dinner with famed director Billy Wilder and his wife Audrey, “They were sort of part of that old guard like the Gregory Pecks, the Irving Lazars, a lot of these people had mutual respect and regard for one another,” she said. “Veronique Peck was just an exquisite woman and had these beautiful dinner parties. I remember being seated next to Walter Matthau and Sidney Poitier, and Elizabeth Taylor was across the way with her new husband, and the Sinatras often invited us for dinner. Gene always said that an invitation from the Sinatras was like an invitation from the Queen. Frank Sinatra was really Gene's true close friend, and they just adored each other. And as Gene said, they were really closer than brothers.”\n\nIn 2011, Patricia conceptualized her live one-woman show dedicated to Gene’s legacy. She has been instrumental in preserving the icon’s legacy by bringing her shows to venues around the world. Earlier this March, Patricia brought “Gene Kelly: A Life in Music,” to Benaroya Hall, which featured The Seattle Symphony performing live to Gene Kelly’s on screen-dancing, an overall mesmerizing showcase. The upcoming shows in December will differ than the previous Seattle shows as Patricia will bring a more intimate experience, and no live performance from the orchestra.\n\n\"It’s more personal because with the symphonic show, I really wanted to shine a light on all the composers, the arrangers, the musicians, and musical numbers Gene conceived,\" she said. “In the one-woman show, people think I'm going to sing and dance and I don’t do either. I leave that all to Gene up on the screen. So, you will see a series of clips, much as you did in the symphonic show. I let him do all of the dancing and singing because I feel like it's a good way for people to really begin to know him. The show focuses more on Gene's innovations with animation and live action with his use of the camera in capturing dance, and most people have no idea how radical his work was and how far ahead of his time he was,” emphasizes Patricia.\n\nWhen it pertains to the emotional aspect of Patricia re-living memories of Gene, she finds it therapeutic in dealing with loss, “It’s almost a cathartic thing because people say to me, how do you do this? It's so emotional, so powerful. How could you do it twice in a day or every night? I would do this every night if I could. Because for me, being able to talk about Gene’s death and about loss and grief has helped me immensely to begin to deal with the absence of him,” Patricia noted. Also fondly remembering how romantic Gene was, Patricia shares some cherished memories, “He used to sprinkle valentines all around the house for me and was the kind of guy who used to take me outside to look at the full moon because he thought it was so romantic,” she said.\n\nGoing forward, Patricia has potential plans to prepare material from Gene’s collection for the International Museum of Dance, “I'm in the process of beginning to curate and digitize everything. I think everybody in the world ought to have access to these things and be able to learn, to hear Gene’s voice and hear him describe what he's doing. And I believe that these things should be available, but in a good way that they're preserved,” she said.\n\nDisappointed that Hollywood disregarded much of its history, including costumes and footage, Patricia previously had old film scores reconstructed and as many musical arrangements were not kept or destroyed, “They threw away the musical in which I had to have regenerated for the other show. I had to recreate a lot of things. Items that could have easily been preserved, which Hollywood didn't see the value in, but there are a few of us who are trying to preserve what we have,” she said. Patricia feels fortunate that Gene was able to save memorabilia, including many letters, telegrams and items such as stationery from Liza Minnelli and letters from film legend Laurence Oliver. She even took the opportunity to purchase Gene’s sailor suit from the 1945 film “Anchors Aweigh.” The outfit had been a part of Debbie Reynold’s Hollywood collection, which was eventually auctioned off some years ago.\n\nAs for the December shows in Seattle, people should expect two nights of historical footage of Gene performing, while Patricia narrates throughout the show. It will make for a perfect date night or family outing as you learn about the Hollywood legend. Audience members can also expect to see a little holiday magic or Christmas nostalgia from Patricia, “One of the things Gene loved was Christmas. I remember he was sitting on the sofa with a vodka tonic, and we had Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Andy Williams on the stereo singing Christmas carols, and Gene loved it. I would decorate the whole house, and we would go out and pick our Christmas tree together. It was so much fun, and I have never been able to unpack the Christmas decorations since he passed, but the show will be a very nice holiday experience for families and people of all ages to attend.”\n\nSpeaking of Washington state native Bing Crosby, Patricia shares her perception of Crosby’s relationship with Gene, “He was older, and kind of in a different world from Gene. Astaire and Crosby were more so in the elite and wealthier crowd, such as with the Vanderbilts and Whitneys and into horse-betting. Gene didn’t go to the horses and things, and was politically different,” she adds.\n\nIn reflecting on Gene Kelly for his hard work and contributions to the entertainment industry, Patricia wants others to know just how he wanted to be remembered, “He wished to be remembered as the man who changed the look of dance on film and who created a particular American style of dance. He also wanted to be remembered for being behind the camera more than in front, both as a director and choreographer. He often gets lopped off of those lists, sadly. And I think he's such a big presence on the screen that people forget he directs the movie and creates the numbers in the films,” she said.\n\nGrateful for her life experiences, Patricia loves honoring her late husband and sharing his legacy with the world, “It is a real privilege to be in this position and extraordinary. To be able to connect with so many people from around the world from many walks of life. And that's the other thing is that Gene doesn't have a demographic as the audiences are so mixed, and I think that's what people are looking for now is accessibility, engagement and connection. I think people want to connect after coming out of COVID, and people who write to me, I take the time to write back. I love meeting and talking to everyone.”\n\nCatch Patricia Ward Kelly this Dec. 14 15 at Benaroya Hall. Grab your tickets while they're still available.
