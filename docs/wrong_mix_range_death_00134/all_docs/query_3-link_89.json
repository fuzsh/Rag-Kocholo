        "text": "Last night, I watched my favorite movie for what must have been the hundredth time. It is “Singin’ in the Rain,” with Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. I think it is very close to the perfect Hollywood musical (except for the song where Kelly and O’Connor ridicule the elocution teacher).\n\nSo, as I watched, I began googling sites about “The Making of Singin’ in the Rain”) and discovered some startling facts. (By the way, autocorrect hates it when you write the word “Singin’, and tries to make it “Singing”).\n\nI already knew that Debbie Reynolds was a 19-year-old gymnast who did not have any dance training and was taught on the set by Gene Kelly. I knew that she cried and her feet were bleeding after the hours of making the famous number when they sing “Good Morning, Good Morning, It’s Great to Stay Up Late.”\n\nIn the climactic scene in the movie, Debbie (Kathy Selden) stands behind a curtain and dubs a song for the leading lady Lina Lamont (played by Jean Hagen), who has a horrible screechy voice.\n\nWhat I didn’t know and just discovered was that Debbie Reynolds’ voice was dubbed in that famous last scene when she was supposedly dubbing for Jean Hagen! The actual singer of the song at the end, when Debbie was supposedly singing for Lina Lamont, was Betty Noyes.\n\nBetty Noyes dubbed Debbie Reynolds’ voice in “Would You?” and “You Are My Lucky Star” and the final number “Singin’ in the Rain.”\n\nFurthermore, when Kathy Selden dubs the line that Lina Lamont speaks (“Until the stars turn cold”) in the movie-within-a-movie called “The Dancing Cavalier,” the actual voice that was dubbed was Jean Hagen’s real voice.\n\nSo Debbie was dubbed by Betty Noyes, and Debbie was dubbed in the speaking line for the movie-within-the-movie by the woman she was allegedly dubbing.\n\nIrony! The woman who was dubbing in the film was also dubbed.\n\nThis is a gem for those of us who love this movie.\n\nAnd I still love Debbie, Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, and “Singin’ in the Rain.”"
