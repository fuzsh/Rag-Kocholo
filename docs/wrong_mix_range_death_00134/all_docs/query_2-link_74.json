        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Gene Kelly did a lot more than just sing in the rain.\n\nKelly changed the way dance looked on film, creating innovative choreography and experimenting with lighting and camera techniques. His on-camera attire and attitude made dance more relevant for moviegoers, stomping out 1930s and '40s perceptions that it was just a pastime for the well-heeled.\n\nKelly's upbringing in Pittsburgh, and his impact on Hollywood, will be examined Thursday at the Gene Kelly Centennial Celebration at the University of Pittsburgh's Alumni Hall.\n\nKelly's widow, Patricia Kelly, will host the free event, sharing unique insights while screening excerpts from Kelly films.\n\n\"Growing up in Pittsburgh really shaped his work ethic,\" Patricia Kelly said in a phone interview.\n\nKelly was born Aug. 23, 1912, one of five siblings raised in a lower-middle class area of Highland Park. At the insistence of his mother, he began taking dance lessons at age 8, when he would have rather been playing baseball with his friends.\n\n\"What I really wanted to be was a shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates,\" Kelly told an interviewer decades later. \"The Pittsburgh Pirates lost a hell of a shortstop.\"\n\nSports' loss would be showbiz's gain.\n\nPITTSBURGH TO HOLLYWOOD\n\nAfter graduating from Peabody High School, Kelly enrolled at Penn State, but had to quit and move back home after his father, a gramophone salesman, lost work due to the Depression.\n\nKelly helped with family finances, first by creating dance routines with his younger brother, Fred, to win prize money in local contests, and later teaching dance at a studio the family opened in Squirrel Hill, which gave him tuition money to attend Pitt.\n\nKelly later became a dancer and choreographer for the Pittsburgh Playhouse, where his skills caught the attention of a Broadway choreographer who helped Kelly gain a New York foothold. Kelly's acclaimed work in Rodgers and Hart's \"Pal Joey\" made him a Broadway star, and landed him a Hollywood contract.\n\nKelly made his film debut in 1942 with Judy Garland in \"For Me and My Gal.\"\n\nTwo years later he co-starred in \"Cover Girl\" with Rita Hayworth, where he devised a memorable routine, dancing with his own reflection.\n\nHis Pittsburgh upbringing and his family's struggles during the Depression influenced how Kelly would portray dance on film.\n\n\"He didn't want to dance like a rich person,\" his wife said.\n\nMoviegoers accustomed to seeing Fred Astaire hoofing in top hats, tails and tuxedos soon were filling theaters to see Kelly high-stepping in normal clothes in regular settings.\n\nKelly and co-star Frank Sinatra wore U.S. Navy attire in the 1945 smash \"Anchors Away,\" for which Kelly created his groundbreaking dance routine with an animated mouse.\n\nWhen asked to reflect on his career, Kelly often said his favorite roles -- according to his wife -- were as the swashbuckling d'Artagnan in 1948's \"The Three Musketeers,\" and 1949's \"On the Town,\" paired again with Sinatra performing ballet moves in the first musical shot on location.\n\nKelly etched his spot in the pantheon of iconic film performances with his umbrella swinging, puddle stomping, lamp-post-hopping routine in 1952's \"Singin' in the Rain.\"\n\nPushing 40 at the time, Kelly co-directed and choreographed \"Singin' in the Rain,\" which many regard as Hollywood's top musical.\n\n\"I was only 18 when we made that movie, and the hardest thing was keeping up with his energy,\" co-star Debbie Reynolds recalled in 1996, shortly after news broke that Kelly had died at the age of 83 after suffering a series of strokes.\n\nHe died in his Beverly Hills home with his third wife, 37-year-old Patricia, by his side.\n\nPERSONAL INSIGHTS\n\nPatricia Kelly had first met her husband in 1985 at the Smithsonian where he was serving as narrator for a television special for which she was a writer.\n\n\"I was this nerdy Melville scholar -- and I know it's kind of hard to believe now -- but I didn't recognize him. I just had this job to do writing a script for a TV show, and we were just thrown together,\" she said.\n\nThey connected immediately, sharing an interest in word games and poetry.\n\n\"I really fell in love with his use of language,\" she said. \"It was a wonderful blend of Pittsburgh street kid and erudite gentleman. His mind was so agile and his breadth of knowledge was phenomenal.\"\n\nKelly invited her to California to write his memoirs, a job for which she recorded his words nearly every day for more than 10 years.\n\n\"A lot of the notes I scratched while he was seated at the piano bar,\" she said. \"I have an inside story that no one else has.\"\n\nThey married in 1990 and were together until his death in 1996.\n\nLiving in Los Angeles, Patricia Kelly is completing the book about her late husband, and is often called upon to introduce Kelly's films in theaters and at festivals. Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne featured her when introducing four Kelly films for the film star's Aug. 23 centenary.\n\nKelly wouldn't have wanted anyone making a big deal about his 100th birthday, Patricia Kelly said.\n\n\"He didn't want a fuss about his 80th birthday,\" she said. \"That was just another round number to him.\"\n\nThe anniversary, however, provides an opportunity to reinforce his legacy.\n\n\"The things he wished to be remembered for were changing the way dance looks on film,\" she said.\n\nLEGACY TODAY\n\nFor the past 13 years, Patricia Kelly has been guest speaker at the Gene Kelly Awards at Pittsburgh's Benedum Center, which honor excellence in musical theater among Allegheny County high schools.\n\nPeople in Pittsburgh have talked for more than a decade about erecting a statue in Kelly's honor, but nothing has happened. Patricia Kelly likes a suggestion a letter writer to a Pittsburgh paper made recently that the fountain at Point State Park be named after her husband.\n\n\"I think that's an extraordinary idea,\" she said."
