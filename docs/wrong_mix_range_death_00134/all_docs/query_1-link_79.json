        "text": "Full Name: Eugene Kelly\n\nProfession: Actor and Dancer\n\nBiography: Gene Kelly transformed the Hollywood musical in the 1950s with his athletic dancing style and modern choreography. The 1952 musical \"Singin' in the Rain\" with his famous dance partnering an umbrella around a lamp post is often considered the 'greatest musical ever made'.\n\nKelly originally began performing on Broadway before being offered a film contract with MGM in 1942. After serving two years in the US Navy during WWII he returned to MGM as a performer, producer and director. His successful films include \"One the Town\" (1949) with Frank Sinatra, \"An American in Paris\" (1951) with director Vincent Minnelli and Leslie Caron, which won eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and a special Oscar for Kelly.\n\n\"Singin' in the Rain\" followed along with \"Hello Dolly\" with Barbra Streisand in 1969. In 1960 Kelly was asked to choreograph a ballet for the Paris Opera and his \"Concerto in F\" received 27 curtain calls on its premiere. The French government later made Kelly a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.\n\nBorn: August 23, 1912\n\nBirthplace: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rat\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
