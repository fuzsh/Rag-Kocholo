        "text": "\"Kelly\"\n\nRobert “Kelly” Gene Kelly, age 88, died February 20, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was born October 2, 1935 in Fort Worth, Texas to Clarence Kelly and Eady Ore. He married Betty Jean Ward. Together they had one son, Adam.\n\nKelly grew up in Dallas, Texas. As a young man he learned the importance of following after your dream. He caught this vision as a small boy when he accompanied his father to Kayente, Arizona to mine for Uranium. While they didn’t strike it rich, they had great adventures that would encourage chasing dreams for generations.\n\nKelly’s life was focused on his dreams to be an accomplished musician. He made life long friends with his band mates, Jay, Jerry and Kirby. Their band was named Expression. They recorded many albums and had success playing in many different clubs and casinos. Later, he would join other bands and experiment with solo endeavors and setting a recording studio in his home. He enjoyed music through out his life.\n\nKelly had other dreams worth chasing. Another dream was building homes. In the late ‘70’s he came to Logandale, Nevada. There he bought a run down three story masonry home sitting on a basement. Affectionately known as the haunted house, Kelly and Betty restored it and made it a home. While he has not lived in this home for years, it still stands as a testament to their hard work and craftsmanship.\n\nHe later built a home in Reno, Nevada, then he lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma and finally moved back to Las Vegas, Nevada. Kelly always enjoyed fishing, camping, river rafting and panning for gold. He loved to visit National Parks. He loved trips to Mexico, driving down the Baja, exploring and enjoying the ocean. Through it all, he followed his dreams. He set an example for his son and grandchildren to have courage, treat others with respect and face adversity with dignity, class and strength.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Adam of Las Vegas; grandchildren: Teandra and Dylan; great grand children: Owen, Oakley, Addison, Bella and Sophia and sister, Karen.\n\nMemorial services will be held Sunday, May 19, 2024 at his bandmates home in Las Vegas, Nevada.
