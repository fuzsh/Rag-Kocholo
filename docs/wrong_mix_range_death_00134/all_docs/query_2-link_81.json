        "text": "Gene Kelly is played by bayliun.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nGene Kelly had an unfortunate beginning to life. His father died before he took his first breath and his mother died shortly after. Gene spent his early childhood in an orphanage in Dublin but was determined to get away. He began sneaking out until he met a new family on the streets of Dublin. One day he vowed never to go back and joined the Red Bullet Boys.\n\nHe participated in petty crime throughout his early years doing whatever it took to ensure his new family could survive. One day he was unsuccessful in his efforts to pick the pocket of a wealthy man. Upon catching Gene, the wealthy man weighed a heavy decision and decided to offer him a job instead of turning him over to the lawmen. Gene was tasked with sweeping and cleaning the stables. This change in scenery inspired Gene's unrivaled love for horses. As he worked the stables, Gene began to visit the horse races. Only 15, he frequented the races, dreaming of being faster than the winners. After being encouraged to ride the horses at his stable, Gene began practicing at every open opportunity. One day, the wealthy man saw the speed Gene was able to achieve and decided to pay his entrance fee at his first race.\n\nSadly, Gene did not take home first that day. But he did bring home second. The wealthy man issued Gene a challenge. He would pay for entrance fees for the next five races. If Gene was able to win more than he lost, the wealthy man would support him in his horse racing. Gene won all five. Thus began Gene's illustrious career in horse racing. He was faster than people could comprehend, and they referred to him as The Red Bullet. After spending his winnings on his family, Gene began to save the money he made. His dream was to own his own stables and care for his own horses.\n\nAfter buying his stable, Gene was approached by a gentleman who went by the name Mr. English. Mr. English offered Gene an opportunity that would be a great adventure and afford him security he had never known. During this time, a friend of Gene's was stabbed and killed. Robert McDoyle left behind a son and Gene knew that there was no safer place for young Declan McDoyle than by his side.\n\nOutside of his work in the shadows, Gene dedicated himself to his stables. He cared for his horses with the entirety of his heart until the day he met Sandy. She was beautiful and full of a joy that Gene had never experienced. He wanted to be whoever she wanted and do whatever she wanted. After a short period of courting, Gene and Sandy married in a humble ceremony. Slowly, life for Gene became the life he missed as a child. One day, Sandy came to him with the biggest blessing ever and shared with him that she was child. Overjoyed, Gene began working towards security for his family. He worked tirelessly, sometimes having to leave town for business.\n\nThen came the day Gene Kelly will never forget. As he was riding towards his house, he noticed a glow coming from the direction of his house and stables. Frantic, Gene pushed his horse to get to the scene. His house was nothing but glowing ash and his stables were engulfed in flames that were breathing their last. That day he lost his wife and his unborn child, but he gained a rage that couldn't be extinguished. He knew deep down that there was no way the fire was accidental, and someone had to pay. From what had been happening around Dublin, his suspicions pointed to America. He told Declan his plans for revenge and the two of them set off for America.\n\nArrival in the Commonwealth[]\n\nto be written\n\nEvents[]\n\nto be written\n\nRelationships[]\n\nto be written"
