        "text": "Eugene Curran \"Gene\" Kelly (23 August 1912-2 February 1996) was an American actor, dancer, singer, filmmaker, and choreographer. Born in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a family of mostly Irish heritage, he served as a dance instructor at his family's dance studio during the 1930s before moving to New York City to work as a choreographer. In 1941, after his breakthrough role in Pal Joey, he moved to Hollywood to pursue a film career, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Anchors Aweigh in 1945. Kelly played a key role in helping to popularize ballet for film audiences, and he was also well remembered for his song and film \"Singin' in the Rain\" from 1952.\n\nKelly was a lifelong Democrat, protesting the HUAC hearings, severing his ties with the Roman Catholic Church in 1939 due to its support for Francisco Franco's fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War."
