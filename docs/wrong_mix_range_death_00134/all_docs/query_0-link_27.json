Whenever “Lenny,” as Gene called him, was in town, he would stop by Gene’s house to join the others gathered there, including Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, Lennie Hayton, and many more. It was “the” place to be in Hollywood, especially for folks from New York and abroad. Lenny, like Oscar Levant and Noel Coward would play the piano and others, like Judy Garland and Lena Horne, would sing. I don’t believe there is anything like this international “salon” in Hollywood anymore. The actor Roddy McDowall had a version of it at his home, inviting a wide array of guests. But it was less musical and did not include volleyball games or the version of charades Gene called “the game.” Sadly, Roddy’s wonderful evenings died with him. I have tried to keep some version of it going with my “toaster oven dinners.” I think gatherings of creative people and the breaking of bread are vital. But, oh, to have been a little mouse when Lenny stopped by! (P.s. This is a photo of Gene and Bernstein working on On the Town.)\n\n#genekelly #genekellylegacy #leonardbernstein #onthetown\".",
