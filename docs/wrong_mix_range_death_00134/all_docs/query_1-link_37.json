        "text": "(1912–96). By blending techniques of ballet, tap, and jazz in choreography that reflected his own robust, athletic, and acrobatic style, U.S. dancer Gene Kelly gave audiences a new perception of male dancing. He often is credited with revolutionizing the motion-picture musical by taking his dance numbers off Hollywood sound stages and out onto location. He also was known for his innovative scenarios in which, for example, he danced with an “alter ego” image of himself (Cover Girl, 1944) and with a cartoon mouse (Anchors Aweigh, 1945). (See also dance.)\n\nEugene Curran Kelly was born on Aug. 23, 1912, in Pittsburgh, Pa. He grew up loving sports, especially ice hockey, but at his mother’s urging also took dance lessons. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in economics in 1933, he taught dance, danced in vaudeville with his brother Fred, and directed local plays. He debuted on Broadway in 1938—as a chorus boy in Leave It to Me—and the next year was featured in The Time of Your Life. The title role in Pal Joey followed in 1940 and led to a Hollywood contract.\n\nIn 1942 Kelly starred opposite Judy Garland in his first motion picture, For Me and My Gal; he teamed with her again for 1948’s The Pirate. Another of his films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), An American in Paris (1951), ended with a nearly 20-minute ballet. It won the Academy award for best picture, and Kelly was given a special Oscar for his contributions to film musicals.\n\nWhile on loan to Columbia Pictures for Cover Girl, Kelly collaborated with director Stanley Donen and began the experimentation that changed the face of movie musicals, creating dance numbers that utilized motion-picture techniques and that advanced the plot rather than serving merely as entertainment. In 1949 Kelly and Donen codirected On the Town, about three sailors on leave in New York City, which broke film musical tradition by being shot entirely on location. Their next effort was Singin’ in the Rain (1952), which some critics consider the finest of all screen musicals.\n\nAs Hollywood produced fewer musicals, Kelly turned to drama with roles in such films as Crest of the Wave (1954) and Inherit the Wind (1960). He also directed but did not appear in films such as Hello, Dolly! (1969) and The Cheyenne Social Club (1970). In 1960 he choreographed Pas de Deux for the Paris Opera Ballet and earned the French Legion of Honor. That’s Entertainment! (1974, 1976, 1994), the MGM trio of musical anthologies cohosted by Kelly, introduced new audiences to his classic performances.\n\nThe American Film Institute presented Kelly with its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985. He also was a recipient of the National Medal of the Arts (1994). Kelly died on Feb. 2, 1996, in Beverly Hills, Calif."
