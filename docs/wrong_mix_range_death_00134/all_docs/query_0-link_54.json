        "text": "2024 Gene Kelly Awards\n\nThe 2024 Gene Kelly Awards were held on Saturday, May 25, 2024 at the Benedum Center, featuring group performances by the students from the participating schools and medleys from the nominees for Best Actor and Actress.\n\nThe Gene Kelly Awards are presented by the Michael J. Kara Family with additional support provided by Deloitte, The Gismondi Family Foundation, Point Park University, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, PNC Bank, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, and the CLO Ambassadors. Deloitte Consulting, LLP is the official auditor for the Gene Kelly Awards.\n\nAbout the Gene Kelly Awards\n\nThe Gene Kelly Awards for Excellence in High School Musical Theater were launched in 1991 as a means to recognize and encourage student achievement and to focus the attention of the community and school districts on the importance of musical theater and arts education.\n\nPatterned after Broadway’s Tony® Awards, this event celebrates the power of the Arts to significantly improve all areas of education! High school theater programs are the real winners as show business veterans and community celebrities help to spread the word about the achievements of high school students and their school’s musical theater programs. Over the past 33 years, Gene Kelly Award winners have gone on to Broadway and Hollywood careers.\n\nThe Gene Kelly Awards are presented by Pittsburgh CLO, the HRH Foundation, and the Michael J. Kara Family, with additional support from The Gismondi Family Foundation, Deloitte, PNC, Highmark, and the CLO Ambassadors.\n\nGene Kelly Awards Links\n\nFollow the \"Road to the Kellys\" on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nList of Notable Gene Kelly Awards Alumni including Zachary Quinto and Courtney Lopez."
