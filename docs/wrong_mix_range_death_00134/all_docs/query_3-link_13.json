        "text": "Years after actor, dancer and director Gene Kelly’s death, his wife Patricia Ward Kelly still had not unpacked his things.\n\nThe process of reaching into those boxes to pull out his belongings brought her to Chapman University to make a stage presentation, “Gene Kelly: The Legacy,” an in-depth look at his work and life. Her presentation featured never-before-seen images, film and audio of her late husband.\n\nPatricia first met Gene in the 1980s while working on a documentary, where he was a narrator. She had no idea who he was.\n\nAfter working together, Patricia went home and decided to research the man who would later become her husband. She rented around 48 videos of Gene Kelly films, she said.\n\n“I was shocked that I had missed out on so much American culture in the 20th century,” said Patricia.\n\nPatricia revealed in the course of the evening how Gene had gotten his iconic cheek scar. It was not from a duel, as was the rumor, but from a childhood accident on a scooter where the handlebar went through his cheek, she said.\n\nGene Kelly collected eggs because he thought they were the most perfect shape.\n\nHe loved Valentines Day because he loved romance and he would leave handwritten letters around the house all day long for her to find. His favorite person in Hollywood was Judy Garland, for whom he would do anything to help.\n\nPatricia said that after so many years, she has never gotten used to being without Gene.\n\n“I just have had to learn to live with the absence,” said Patricia."
