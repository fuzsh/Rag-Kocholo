Liverpool Oratorio itself was Paul’s first album full-scale departure into classical music. On the night of its live recording, Paul explained: “I remember coming here to Liverpool Anglican Cathedral when I was 11 to audition for the choir. I failed the audition. I always hoped that one day I would be able to get my own back. Three years ago I was given the opportunity when Carl Davis approached me on behalf of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society to write a piece for their 150th Anniversary Celebrations. Carl and I started working then on what was to become the Oratorio for Liverpool. Finally, after hundreds of hours of scoring and re-scoring we finished it.”\n\nPerformed by:\n\nDame Kiri Te Kanawa: Soprano (Mary Dee)\n\nSally Burgess: Mezzo-sopraono (Miss Inkley / Chief Mourner / Nurse)\n\nJerry Hadley: Tenor (Shanty)\n\nWillard White: Bass (Headmaster / Preacher / Mr Dingle)\n\nJeremy Budd: Boy Soloist\n\nRoyal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir & Choristers of Liverpool Cathedral\n\nChorus Master & Master of the Choristers: Ian Tracey\n\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nLeader: Malcolm Stewart\n\nConducted by Carl Davis\n\nMalcolm Stewart: Solo Violin\n\nIan Balmain: Solo Trumpet\n\nTimothy Walden: Solo Cello\n\nAnna Cooper: Cor Anglais\n\nAll tracks composed by Paul McCartney\n\nExecutive Producer: Paul McCartney\n\nProducer: John Fraser\n\nBalance engineer: John Timperley\n\nAdditional Engeineers: Eddie Klein, Peter Mew, Martin Astle, Tom Leader\n\nEditor: Peter Mew & Tom Leader\n\nAssistant to Carl Davis: Nic Raine\n\nRecorded live at Liverpool Cathedral, 18th & 29th June 1991\n\nAll tracks published by MPL Communications Ltd"
