        "text": "The life of Handel: A summary\n\nDiscover more about George Handel’s life and career in this guide, which includes education and influences, background, career and key accomplishments. It will also cover his best known works, along with his music in action.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel was born on February 23, 1685, in Halle, Saxony (now part of Germany). His father, Georg Händel, was a distinguished barber-surgeon, and his mother, Dorothea Taust, recognized her son’s musical talent early on. Young Handel’s exposure to music began at home, where he explored the harpsichord and organ.\n\nHandel’s formal musical education began at the Lateinschule in Halle, where he studied language, literature, and music. Despite his father’s objections to a musical career, Handel’s passion for the art form led him to secretly practice and compose. In 1702, Handel moved to Hamburg, a thriving musical centre, where he performed in the opera orchestra and composed his first operas.\n\nKey influences during Handel’s formative years include his exposure to Italian opera during travels to Italy and his encounters with notable musicians like Arcangelo Corelli. His achievements in Italy solidified his reputation, leading to his appointment as Kapellmeister to the Elector of Hanover.\n\nIn 1710, Handel moved to London, where he found immense success as a composer and performer. His Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks are iconic works from this period. Notably, in 1713, he received a royal appointment as Composer of Musick to the Chapel Royal.\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel’s childhood and early years laid the foundation for a remarkable career marked by innovation and mastery, with his education, familial support, and exposure to diverse musical influences shaping the trajectory of one of the Baroque era’s most celebrated composers.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nIn 1706, Handel travelled to Italy, where he absorbed Italian musical styles and worked with prominent musicians. He composed numerous operas, oratorios, and other vocal and instrumental works during his time in Italy. Handel spent several years working in Germany before moving to London in 1712. He quickly gained recognition for his operas and instrumental compositions. His success in London led to the royal patronage of the future King George II. Handel composed Zadok the Priest in 1727 as part of the coronation anthem he wrote for the coronation ceremony of King George.. The anthem, known as the Coronation Anthems, consists of four parts: Zadok the Priest, Let Thy Hand Be Strengthened, The King Shall Rejoice, and My Heart Is Inditing. These anthems were performed during the coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on October 11, 1727. Zadok the Priest is perhaps the most famous and frequently performed of the four anthems and is known for its majestic and celebratory character.\n\nHandel became a leading opera composer in London, with works like Rinaldo, Giulio Cesare, and Alcina enjoying immense popularity. However, changing tastes and financial challenges in the opera scene led him to shift his focus. Handel found success in oratorios, large-scale choral works with a biblical or religious theme. His most famous oratorio, Messiah, composed in 1741, is a masterpiece that continues to be widely performed and celebrated. In the latter part of his career, Handel’s health declined, but he continued to compose. His later works, such as Theodora and Jephtha, demonstrated a mature and reflective style. Despite financial difficulties, he remained influential and respected in the London musical scene.\n\nLater life\n\nIn the later years of George Frideric Handel’s life, he continued to compose prolifically despite facing various challenges, including declining health and financial difficulties. Handel’s focus shifted towards oratorios in his later years. Notable works include Belshazzar (1744), Jephtha (1751), and Theodora (1750). These compositions showcased a more reflective and mature style, exploring complex characterizations and moral themes.\n\nWhile the popularity of Italian opera waned in London, Handel continued to compose operas such as Deidamia (1741). However, financial challenges in the opera scene prompted him to explore other genres. Handel composed a series of organ concertos and other instrumental works, contributing to the development of the concerto grosso form.\n\nHandel’s health began to deteriorate in the 1730s, and he experienced vision problems. Despite these challenges, he remained dedicated to his musical pursuits. He also faced financial difficulties, exacerbated by the decline in popularity of Italian opera. However, he managed to overcome these challenges through the success of his oratorios.\n\nGeorge Frideric Handel passed away on April 14, 1759, at the age of 74. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, and his funeral was attended by a large gathering, reflecting his esteemed position in the musical world. Handel’s legacy is immense, and he is celebrated as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era. His works, including the iconic Messiah, continue to be performed globally. His influence extends beyond his compositions; he played a crucial role in shaping the English oratorio tradition and contributed significantly to the development of Baroque music.\n\nHandel’s melodic richness, dramatic flair, and mastery of choral writing left an indelible mark on Western classical music. His contributions to opera, oratorio, and instrumental music have earned him a lasting place in the canon of classical composers. Handel’s works are cherished for their emotional depth, structural innovation, and enduring appeal."
