        "text": "Ambitious, Exquisite, Great Singing, Profound, Resonant\n\nSee it if This is one of the most beautiful pieces of theater I’ve ever seen. I was weeping from start to finish. Go in with no expectations.\n\nDon't see it if You don’t like music, I guess, but this show has something for everyone. It’s more of a concert than a linear story.\n\nAmbitious, Beautiful, Epic, Incredible, Operatic\n\nSee it if you enjoy incredible, breathing operatic-level composition/vocals, you like unique story structure/ soundscape that will move you to tears.\n\nDon't see it if you are not a fan of musical performances or are looking for an action packed show with a clear message,you prefer shows with more of a plot\n\nAbsorbing, Epic, Masterful, Must See, Profound\n\nSee it if you're open to the cross section between science and art. this is pure genius\n\nDon't see it if you need to understand the language 100% and have to have surtitles\n\nAbsorbing, Ambitious, Great Singing, Intense, Profound\n\nSee it if you want to see something both entertaining, original and mesmerizing.\n\nDon't see it if you don't like just singing with no plot dialogue.\n\nConfusing, Entertaining, Great Singing, Thought-Provoking, Unusual\n\nSee it if You enjoy an immersive music performances with great singers and a tight band and you don't mind not understanding everything sung.\n\nDon't see it if you prefer linear performances with a clear intention and story to them.\n\nAmbitious, Great Singing, Masterful\n\nSee it if well composed and sung oratorio. music is key here, not the words. harmonies were glorious.\n\nDon't see it if want a story. this is just a bunch of songs around a topic and most of the lyrics were unintelligeable.\n\nAmbitious, Banal, Great Singing, Intelligent, Overrated\n\nSee it if You love a capella, intimate spaces, Dave Malloy-esque layering of voices\n\nDon't see it if You're looking for a story, or meaning without having to look at your libretto Read more\n\n\"Profoundly strange and overwhelmingly beautiful...If the text is sometimes baffling and hermetic, it is confident enough in its oddness that you do not worry about crashing when it flies close to the twee line...What’s haunting is how the oratorio form and Christian’s private cosmology elevate such banal statements to an almost sacred plane. Alternating in the classical manner between massed choral singing and solo arias — all exquisitely performed under the music direction of Ben Moss — she throws several centuries of musical styles into the pot and swirls them around.\"\n\nRead more\n\n\"5/5 stars! A sui generis meditation on time and existence, a classical choral masterwork infused with pop, blues and gospel. A dozen superlative vocalists and six marvelous instrumentalists make sense and aural spectacle out of Christian's compositions...Lest that sound pretentious, be assured that 'Oratorio for Living Things' is, above all, exhilarating.\"\n\nRead more\n\n\"I have always been a little annoyed by dramatists’ slipshod use of scientific principles — perhaps because I’ve seen too many plays that shoehorn quantum theory into human relationships...But Christian smashes through that old prejudice of mine. As her smiling performers, all in beautiful voice, sing that we are 'made for collision' because of our atomic makeup, I believed it. The 'Oratorio for Living Things' uses music to dissolve the listeners into their fundamental particles, then uses simple choreography and intimate eye contact to reorganize us.\"\n\nRead more\n\n\"This collision of classical music, experimental theater, and theoretical physics generates so much creative energy, it feels like it could power every theater in New York...While no performer stands out, all make personal connections with the material and each audience member...Music director Ben Moss achieves an almost seamless vocal cohesion in a chorus that is always on the move, performing in the round.\"\n\nRead more\n\n\"You can’t understand the delicate alchemy of performers and material, staging and design that have resulted in this transportive experience unless you witness it for yourself. Christian, director Lee Sunday Evans, and the soul-altering eighteen-person ensemble of singers and musicians have achieved something so intensely personal for the audience that it then unites the individuals into a collective...Christian’s composition is wholly original, often startling, occasionally hilarious. The sheer volume of complicated, avant-garde music the singers are tasked with performing from memory is a feat unto itself.\"\n\nRead more\n\nsuch a gorgeous, awe-inspiring concert of original music by Heather Christian that it feels like a religious experience. Indeed, the music — inflected with Baroque, gospel, blues, pop, and jazz — could work as a church service. A third of the songs are even in Latin… It’s not necessary to grasp fully what’s going on in order to appreciate the soaring score….[but] there’s no denying the show’s intellectual complexity\n\nRead more\n\n\"'Oratorio' is unique in that it is like a mass—glorious and contemplative—but there is no single preacher. Instead, the ensemble of twelve performers...It is a sprawling topic, and Christian’s rich score provides all the wild and loving notes to give it its due. And while this mass reminded me of the inextricable ties between a church service and theater, I am not sure this particular piece needed theatricalizing: I would have preferred just to listen to it.\"\n\nRead more"
