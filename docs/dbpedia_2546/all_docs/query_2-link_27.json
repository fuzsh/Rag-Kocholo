        "text": "1777\n\n[Charles Burney to Thomas Twining, ca 1 January 1777]\n\nJanuary\n\nThe lessons for the harpsichord of Mr. Handel, abounding with fugues of the finest contexture, and the most pathetic airs, are an inexhaustible fund of delight; those of the present time have no other tendency than to degrade an instrument invented for the elegant recreation of the youthful of the other sex, and to render it, what at best it now appears to be, and may as truly as emphatically be termed, a tinkling cymbal .It affords but small satisfaction to a lover of the art to reflect that the world is in possession of such instrumental compositions as those of Corelli, Bononcini, Geminiani, and Handel, when not one principal performer in ten has any relish of their excellencies, or can be prevailed on to execute them but with such a degree of unfeeling rapidity, as to destroy their effect, and utterly to defeat the intention of the author. In such kind of performance, wherein not the least regard is paid to harmony or expression, we seek in vain for that most excellent attribute of music, its power to move the passions, without which this divine science must be considered in no better a view than as the means of recreation to a gaping crowd, insensible of its charms, and ignorant of its worth.\n\nFeb 5\n\nSOCIETY of SACRED MUSIC. / THIS Evening will be a grand Rehearsal of SACRED MUSIC, Vocal and Instrumental, at St. Georges Lutheran Chapel, in Little Alie-street, Goodmans-fields, from Seven to Nine; when the first Part out of the Messiah, with select Anthems, favourite Songs and Chorusses from Sacred Oratorios, and Overtures by Sachini, Vanmaldere, and Stamitz will be performed. The principal Vocal Parts by Mr. Friend, of the Chapel Royal, Master Harrison, and other eminent Performers. The First Violin by Mr. Cocklin. / Tickets to be had at Batsons and Carolina Coffee-houses; and No[.] 26, next Door to the Chapel. A Gallery Ticket for one Evening Two Shillings, and for the Body One Shilling.\n\nFeb 5\n\nThe Lovers of the divine Handel will this Season be gratified with an Union of Excellence in the Performance of the Oratorios, at Covent-Garden Theatre, never known before. The Band is composed of every Performer of the first Eminence of their respective Instruments. Signor Tenduccis admirable Powers in Handels Style of Composition can never be forgot; and Miss Harrup (at present only known by the first Amateurs of the Science of Music) is pronounced to be the most perfect Singer that ever adorned this Country.\n\nFeb 6\n\nCovent Garden Theatre. / [...] The Oratorios for the ensuing Lent will commence on Friday the 14th Inst. under the Direction of Dr. Arnold. Among the principal Performers of the Band are Messrs. La Motte, Cervetto, De Champ, and Stamitx [sic]: The principal Vocal Performers are Signor Tenducci, Mr. Saville, Mr. Reinhold, Miss Storace, and Miss Harrup.\n\nFeb 12\n\nCovent Garden Theatre. / On Friday the Oratorio of Judas Maccabaeus, in which Mr. Tenducci will make his first Appearance here these eight Years, and Miss Harrup, who never before appeared in public.\n\nFeb 13\n\nA Musical Amateur and passionate Admirer of our late inimitable and justly regretted Composer, the Immortal Vento, is not a little surprized that the distressed, the cruelly-injured Widow of a Man who did Honour to his Profession, who was, to say the least of him, the Handel of his Day, should yet have had no Offers made to procure her a Benefit. Deprived of an affectionate Husband, and with him deprived in a manner of her All, shall such a Woman not find Favour from the Great? It were a Disgrace to our National Character to suppose it. The generous Public are not perhaps aware, that Mrs. Vento, from a State of Ease, Affluence, and Happiness, is reduced to a State which calls at once for Pity and for Protection.\n\nFeb 14\n\nFeb 14\n\nCovent Garden Theatre. / [...] The Oratorio of Judas Maccabaeus was last Night received throughout the whole Performance with the warmest Marks of universal Approbation by a numerous and brilliant Audience: Proper Notice will be given of the second Time of performing it.On Wednesday next Messiah.\n\nFeb 14\n\nA Correspondent who attended the Performance of Judas Maccabaeus on Friday at Covent-Garden, congratulates the Public on the Acquisition of so very capital a Singer as Miss Harrup, from whom the Musical World may expect much future Entertainment. Before she had gone through her first Song, it must have been evident to all present, who are in any Degree conversant in Music, that she possesses the justest Taste, together with the most elegant Sensibility; Qualities rarely found in an Oratorio Singer. And in the subsequent Parts of the Performance, her Execution appeared to be in no Respect inferior to her Judgment. Her Voice besides being rich, sweet, and even, is also extremely interesting, and her Shake uncommonly brilliant and beautiful. In short, our Correspondent say, he does not remember to have heard a Singer in whom are united so many Perfections, and whose Judgment has been so little dazzled by the false Glare of vulgar Ornament. Our Correspondent observes, that if any Thing was wanting to render the Entertainment complete, it were to be wished she had sung a little louder: However, great Allowances ought to be made for that Diffidence which always accompanies modest Merit, which must have been greatly increased by the Apprehensions of a first Appearance before the Public.But as a real Well-wisher to a Person who has entertained him so highly, he cannot help expressing his Hopes, that as her Fears subside, she will give Proofs that she is by no Means deficient in Power.\n\nFeb 19\n\nFeb 19\n\nFor the Public Advertiser. / INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY. / Covent-Garden. / THE Messiah was performed last Night to a very brilliant Audience. The masterly Manner in which Mr. Tenducci executed his Musical Task, engrossed all the Plaudits. His vocal Powers are so extensive, and his Taste so captivating, that we do not hesitate to pronounce him the most capital Singer that ever trod an English Stage, excepting only the late Miss Linley, now Mrs. Sheridan; for the bewitching Musical Abilities of this Lady, can only be rivalled [sic] by those harmonious Notes, with which Angels are thought to express their Happiness in Heaven.Miss Harrup has the Advantage of a clear and melodious Voice, which indeed is the differentia specifica of a great Singer; but she must overcome many Difficulties ere she may be able to cut a splendid Figure in the Musical World. As to Miss Storace, we suspend giving our Opinion till she be recovered from her Indisposition, to which the Deficiencies of her Performance may be imputed. The Solo by Mr. La Motte was inimitable. The Connoisseurs in Italy have dubbed Signor Lolli Prince of the Fiddlers; after him they place Nardini, Pugnani, and Crammer; but should they hear Mr. La Motte, they would undoubtedly judge him equal if not to Lolli, at least to the others. We do not forget the Merit of Signor Giardini, who among us is deemed a very eminent Fiddler; but we mean only to relate the Opinion of the Professors of Music all over Italy.\n\nFeb 21\n\nFeb 22\n\nAs we [i.e. The Public Advertiser] wish not to encourage Cap-pulling, we shall not insert the Paragraph concerning Miss H[arrup]. of Covent-Garden Theatre, and Miss L[inley]. of Drury-Lane Theatre; and at the same Time would advise their respective Partizans to be silent on the Subject, as the most certain Way of proving themselves real and not pretended Friends.\n\nFeb 26 1777\n\nFeb 27\n\nThe favourite Oratorio of the Prodigal Son, composed by Dr. Arnold, will be performed To-morrow at the Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden, when, by particular Desire, Mrs. Farrel will make her First Appearance in the Oratorios.\n\nFeb 28\n\nFeb 28\n\nThis Day is published, Price 1s. / THE PRODIGAL SON, an Oratorio: / Written by Mr. Hull, and set by Dr. Arnold; as it will be performed this Evening at Covent Garden Theatre.

But of all the curious particulars with which his article abounds, none is more pleasing than the character which closes it, it being drawn with that glow, that pathos, which distinguishes portraits con amore, and does equal honour both to the painter and his subject. One instance we cannot help giving, and wish we had room for more: The loss of his sight, and the prospect of his approaching dissolution, wrought a great change in his temper and general behaviour. He was a man of blameless morals, and throughout his life manifested a deep sense of religion. In conversation he would frequently declare the pleasure he felt in setting the Scriptures to music, and how much the contemplating the many sublime passages in the Psalms had contributed to his edification; and now that he thought himself near the end, these sentiments were improved into solid and rational piety, attended with a calm and even temper of mind. For the last two or three years of his life he was used to attend divine service in his own parish-church of St. George, Hanover-square, where, during the prayers, the eyes that at this instant are employed in a faint portrait of his excellencies, have seen him on his knees, expressing by his looks and gesticulations the utmost fervour of devotion. And again: Such as were but little acquainted with Handel are unable to characterize him otherwise than by his excellencies in his art, and certain foibles in his behaviour, which he was never studious to conceal: accordingly we are told, that he had a great appetite, and that when he was provoked, he would break out into profane expressions. These are facts that cannot be denied; but there are sundry particulars that tend to mark his character, but little known, and which may possibly be remembered when those that serve only to shew that he was subject to human passions are forgotten . In the course of this article the contest between him and Bononcini, and afterwards between him and Senesino, and the part which the nobility took against him, are particularly discussed. Contentions, in short, among the singers, male and female, that genus irritabile, too often discordant in the midst of harmony, fill many succeeding pages. Of these distinguished are the merits of Mrs. Robinson, afterwards Countess of Peterborough, Cuzzoni, and Faustina, among the women, and of Senesino and Farinelli among the men, if such they may be called. By the way, glad we are to find such a note of reprobation stamped by this judicious writer on the dangerous tendency and effects of the Beggars Opera, peculiarly becoming him as a magistrate, and long ago foretold by Archbp. Herring. Memoirs of Dr. Greene, his attachment to Bononcini, and his opposition to Handel, and the origin of the Madrigal Society founded by Dr. Pepusch, form an interesting part of this aera.\n\nAugust\n\n[ ] on the 23d May, 1776, a few enterprising persons opened another Vauxhall on an estate formerly called the Red Cliff, and promised,in return for a moderate subscription, to give a grand concert every Monday and Thursday evening during the summer season. Admission to non-subscribers, one shilling. Handels Acis and Galatea was performed in the following August [1777], when there was a transparency on the bowling green. The place was extensively patronised at the outset [ ]\n\nODE.\n\nTo be performed by Dr. BRETTLE, and a Chorus of HALES-OWEN CITIZENS.\n\n[ ]\n\nSOLO by the DOCTOR.\n\nHear but this straintwas made by HANDEL,\n\nA wight of skill, and njudgment deep!\n\nZoonters theyre goneSAL, bring a candle\n\nNo, here is one, and hes asleep."
