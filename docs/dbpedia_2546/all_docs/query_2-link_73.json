        "text": "When I was about 14 or 15 I was bought my first stereo system. A pretty cheap affair from Dixons that actually lasted me about 12 years. As part of the purchase of this, my Mum also signed up with a classical CD subscription service. In return for 6 free CDs (actually pretty good stuff specially recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, English Chamber Orchestra and Philharmonia Orchestra), I would for a year receive 2 CDs a month (for a fee) of my choice from a limited-ish range of about 100 CDs.\n\nBecause even at 14 or 15 I liked hearing less well known pieces by well known composers, it caught my eye that one of the discs on offer was the Christmas Oratorio by Saint-Saens. “A Christmas Oratorio by Saint-Saens? That’s weird” I thought. So I ordered it – a recording on the Capriccio label by the Dresden Philharmonic and Choir. And boy was it a good purchase. I really love this piece and have done since I was teenager (the other piece on the disc, the christmas cantata Vom Himmel Hoch by Mendlessohn is also excellent). It helps the recording is also an excellent one.\n\nThe first thing to say about the Christmas Oratorio of 1858 (written for his first Christmas as organist of the Madeleine church in Paris) is that it is very unlike anything else Saint-Saens wrote. It’s nearest piece in similarity of style is the Mass of a couple years previous. But this is a much less formulaic piece than that – far better balanced (it doesn’t outstay its welcome) – and it’s just consistent beautiful to listen to. If you could have a CD of the ‘the most calm and peaceful classical music (by Saint Saens) ever’ then this 10 movement work would probably occupy 10 tracks. That sounds like faint praise – but this is not a Christmas Oratorio in the Bach mould of festive trumpets and drums. This is a chamber choir with soloists, organ, strings and, in a memorable couple of movements a harp. We are looking at the same kind of sound world here as Fauré’s Requiem.\n\nThe Oratorio opens with a ‘Shepherds in the fields’ pastorale prelude described in some places as ‘in the style of Bach’ – which is bizarrely off the mark (I can’t believe Saint-Saens gave it that title) that it would be like listening to be-bop jazz and sagely nodding ‘you know, this is remarkably like Hildegard of Bingen’. Starting with just the organ holding a single note, it expands it a gently lilting tune with the strings entering. Not much is developed, but the overall effect is one of immense tranquility – and it genuinely does feel very Christmassy (short of the odd sleigh bell)\n\nAppropriately we move from this pastoral scene into a tenor recitative where the “and shepherd were in the fields” story is told, with the appearance of the angel telling them not to be afraid is succeeded by the heavenly choir single Glory to God in the Highest (with hints, not for the first time in the oratorio, of plain chant as the basis for the melodic line).\n\nA short and simple soprano aria supporting by strings and solo cello, tells us how she is expecting the lord (which I suppose is somewhat more exciting than expecting the roofing contractors). A very simple but effective movement, setting in train a tendency for the oratorio to build up in forces throughout.\n\nAnother aria, this time for tenor (Lord I believe in you), sees our tenor punctuated by plainsong-y heavenly choir-y interjections from the chorus. THere’s also some nice and chilled organ accompaniment in here (the recording below taken from the version I have)\n\nWith the fifth movement, we have the standard mass text of the Benedictus (Blessed are they who come in the name of the lord), but striking set for two soloists plus harp playing a slightly nervous accompaniment in A minor. Oddly, given the gentleness of the text here, this is one of the Oratario’s more nervy movements – and ends very strangely when all of a sudden the organ enters with a rapid and slightly sinister passage that sounds rather like something Captain Nemo would play on his submarine keyboard.\n\nPerhaps the ending of the Benedictus is designed to prepare us for the next movement – the only non-subdued movement in whole piece – “Why do people fight?”. The strings accompanied by organ give an insistent repetitive motif, and choir enter fortissimo. But this does not last, and we soon return to the gentle nature of the rest of the work, even before the end of the movement.\n\nThe next movement (Tecum Principium) is another striking trio (Soprano, Tenor and Bass I think) accompanied by rapid arpeggios on the harp. The vocal lines flow against each other enormously effectively and there’s some really excellent and interesting chord progressions.\n\nThe final three movements segue into each other and serve as a single movement also. Starting with a gentle Alleluia with a solo tenor accompanied by strings, we lead into a recapitulation of the organ-led pastoral prelude of the opening of the oratorio, but after a brief reminder of this material, the music veers into a fabulous movement “Consurge Filia Sion” where all of the forces we have heard – 5 soloists, organ, harp strings and choir join together. Particular effective is that the choir sings its “Alleluias” continually in unison here. Just when it seems the movement is added we get a sudden dramatic section of tremolo strings and fortissimo choir (in unison) – but the drama doesn’t last and fades down to just the organ reminding us subtly of the pastorale. Finally we end with a rousing chorale tune – which actually feels a little out of place and humdrum compared to the rest of the work – but at least leaves everybody with a Christmassy smile on their face\n\nChristmas Oratorio Op. 12\n\nWhy you might want to listen to it: It’s a really fantastic piece – beautiful to listen to and to play in/sing. Saint-Saens wrote it in 10 days as well – to which I can only say that he should have tried that trick more often. Yes, it is very simply written (it’s not remotely virtuosic or difficult music – with the simplest of melodic lines and accompaniments) – but the effect it creates is more Christmassy than any bloody Troika from Lieutenant Kije."
