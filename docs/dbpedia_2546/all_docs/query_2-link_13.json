        "text": "This week‚Äôs theme is‚Ä¶MORE Music About Animals! There‚Äôs just too much animal fun to contain within a single week‚Ä¶\n\nMORE Music About Animals, Day 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúStraight opening her fertile womb‚Äù from The Creation by Franz Joseph Haydn\n\nIf you were cynical, as some historians are, you could make the case that George Frideric Handel was a stifling, homogenizing influence on British music. If you were more charitable, you could say he left a stunning legacy that nourished it. Whichever point of view you take, it is indisputable that he left a deep impression on the face of British music, becoming its greatest composer during his lifetime, and leaving a wake that spanned from the Baroque era to, practically, the modern one. His influence allowed another German to slip into the British musical scene, dominating it during his lifetime, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn does not exactly feel like Handel, but his conservative propriety ‚Äì he is the most refined and genteel of the early Romantics ‚Äì played right into the Victorian sensibility, drawing upon the basic outline of Handel‚Äôs Anglican inventions. Most would agree that Purcell was the best English composer before Handel and Elgar the greatest after. You could make a case for Arthur Sullivan, but in many ways he was not able to escape the gravity of Handel and then Mendelssohn; listening to Sullivan is often very much like listening to a more natively English Mendelssohn in his songs and religious works, or Johann Strauss in his operettas. Still, most would agree that his comic music manages to carve out a niche all its own, hence its endurance. Sullivan was frustrated that he did not find a firmer place in the Western firmament ‚Äì perhaps the legacy which pressed upon the music of his nation had something to do with that. It was not until the distinctively lyrical music of composers like Elgar (see this post) and Delius (see this post) that English music really began to feel distinctive again, pulling away, at least in part, from the weight of Handel and Mendelssohn (ironically, Delius was quite Germanic, his parents having been born in Westphalia and emigrating to England to expand their wool business. But his music breathes with a spring-like melodic sense that feels completely British).\n\nLondoners, cosmopolitan by nature, had a way of seeking out musical trends beyond their borders and inviting them in. This was true during Handel‚Äôs day, as the London aristocracy eagerly ate up his Italian operas in the 1720s and 1730s. A century later they were wild about Mendelssohn. And right about smack-dab between Handel and Mendelssohn they were totally crazy about another composer, not German but Germanic, the Austrian Franz Joseph Haydn. As Haydn happily worked away the 1760s, 70s and 80s, composing symphony after symphony for the Esterhazies, his fame was steadily radiating outward from the provincial, rural estate. When Haydn gained some freedom due to a shift in priorities in his patron family, an impresario named Johann Peter Salomon quickly jumped on the opportunity, offering to broker potentially lucrative trips to London to present the grandest symphonies he had ever produced. During two trips to London in the 1790s audiences there enthusiastically received Haydn‚Äôs last twelve symphonies, often called his ‚ÄúLondon Symphonies‚Äù and sometimes his ‚ÄúSalomon Symphonies‚Äù (see this post and this one). The trips were a resounding success and lucrative for both Haydn and Salomon. And during his visits to London, Haydn encountered a form of art which made a lasting impression on him, one that inspired some of the greatest and most inventive music of his final years, the oratorios of Handel.\n\nHandel had emigrated to London from his native Germany by way of Italy, settling in the English capital with the intention of living out his days supported by the profits of presenting the Italian operas of his pen, and others‚Äô. This worked well for two decades, filling the 1710s and 1720s. But in the early 1730s the demand began to wane and Handel was forced to look into other ways to profit from his music (see this post). The solution he came to is what is now known as Handelian Oratorio, an unstaged biblical opera with rich choruses, set in English. Handel began to write them in earnest beginning with 1732‚Äôs Esther. In all, he wrote about 20 of them, and they cemented his legacy among the British. Messiah of 1742 is the best known (see this post), but Handel wrote colorful oratorios about many biblical stories and characters including Joseph, Saul, Solomon (see this post), Samson, Joshua, and many more. One particularly inventive and dramatically terse oratorio by Handel is Israel in Egypt of 1739 which recounts the story of the Israelites‚Äô exodus from Egypt. Handel obviously had fun designing special, evocative music to illustrate each of the plagues. Here‚Äôs a few examples‚Ä¶\n\nThe frogs ‚Äì can you hear them hopping?\n\nThe lice and flies ‚Äì\n\nAnd a rather cheerful and splendorously Baroque hailstorm ‚Äì\n\nIf you think too hard about it you might become depressed by the realization that Handel was setting horrifying images to what is often very cheerful and peppy music. Best not to ‚Äì it is entertainment after all. It is thought that Haydn was particularly taken with Israel in Egypt given similar devices employed in his greatest oratorio, The Creation. Composed a half century after Israel in Egypt, The Creation is the first of two oratorios composed by Haydn on the Handelian model. It has all of the essential features: a biblical story, an operatic scale, vocal solos, and rich choruses. As a work of art it is extraordinarily balanced and constantly illustrates Haydn‚Äôs irrepressible resourcefulness. Like Handel, Haydn had some fun with certain parts of his oratorio. The best illustration of this is a very dense and ever surprising accompanied recitative in which the archangel Raphael describes the creation of all the different animals of the world. Follow along with the text as you listen ‚Äì you‚Äôll be glad you did üôÇ\n\nStraight opening her fertile womb, the earth obey‚Äôd the word, and teem‚Äôd creatures numberless, in perfect forms and fully grown. Cheerful roaring stands the tawny lion. In sudden leaps the flexible tiger appears. The nimble stag bears up his branching head. With flying mane and fiery look, impatient neighs the sprightly steed. The cattle in herds already seek their food on fields and meadows green. And o‚Äôer the ground, as plants, are spread the fleecy, meek and bleating flock. Unnumber‚Äôd as the sands in whirls arose the host of insects. In long dimensions creeps with sinuous trace the worm.\n\nThe Creation premiered in Vienna (present was Haydn‚Äôs student, Beethoven, who kissed his elder on the forehead in front of the audience), but was published immediately both in German and English, clearly intended for sales and performances across the Channel. A little less than half a century later, Felix Mendelssohn would release his two oratorios, again based on the Handelian frame, in a similar manner. They were St. Paul and Elijah.\n\nIn Handelian oratorio we see a German composer leaving Germany, sprouting in England, and offering the flowers grown in the new soil to his fellow Germans. However you may view his influence on the development of British music, his legacy is an incredibly strong force to be reckoned with and continues to be felt all around the world to this day. Handel‚Äôs stubborn flexibility ensured that the fruits of his inventiveness, so colorful and attractive, would be enjoyed by his fellow Germanic composers who would then toil to grow their own fruits that tasted as good, tinged with the flavors of their respective eras.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

Parting is such sweet sorrow, but it‚Äôs always inevitable. Musicians have explored the rich feelings of saying goodbye for as long as there has been music. This week we examine examples of this from all across history.\n\nMusical Farewells, Day 4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúMiei genitori, adio‚Äù from The First Murder by Alessandro Scarlatti\n\nI remember that back in 2000, my freshman year in college, I was kind of a hotshot, excessively proud of my interest in music history (maybe I still am?). My music theory teacher had a ritual of playing a new piece of music for us at the beginning of class every day and commenting on it a little, just to broaden our horizons and expand our repertoire of art music. That‚Äôs a good idea ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually surprising how easy it is for music students to get caught in their own little bubbles of interest and not take the time to listen around for new things. Having taught similar classes myself, I‚Äôm also impressed at the discipline that he showed in finding varied and interesting music to present daily and commenting on it, not to mention fitting all the class material into the shortened periods that resulted from taking the time to do this.\n\nWell, being the outspoken music history geek, I was always happy to contribute my own obscure findings to this ritual, which he graciously allowed me to do from time to time (it expanded his horizons as well), and so I eagerly culled little-known and colorful items from my own collection to play for the class and he, often bemusedly I imagine, offered the introductions, writing the composer, title, and genre on the board to provide concrete context to my classmates. I remember he made a mistake one day in doing so, a most understandable mistake, and like a dutiful student in an Orthodox yeshiva responding to a scriptural mispronunciation, I called out the correction, which he cheerfully accepted (in retrospect, he was awfully good-natured about all of this). I brought in a recording of this piece (you are welcome to listen to the entire 2 hours if you wish, but if you play a few minutes of the beginning you will hear as much as my theory class was exposed to that morning. Later in the post we will listen to a specific excerpt):\n\nAnd as the overture played he began to write on the whiteboard:\n\nAlessandro Scarlatti ‚Äì opera: Il Primo Omic\n\nAt which point I called out ‚Äúoratorio!‚Äù. And he acquiesced, erasing the offending genre label and replacing it with the correct one. But like I said, it‚Äôs an understandable mistake. Because in this particular work, the two labels are essentially indistinguishable, especially if you don‚Äôt speak Italian or know the subject.\n\nWhen most of us see or hear the word oratorio, I suspect we almost automatically think of George Frideric Handel and his notable contributions to the genre written for British audiences during the 1740s and 1750s. Messiah of 1742 is of course the most famous of these, even though it is atypical of Handel‚Äôs mature oratorio practice in several respects. For a more typical example, see this post. Handelian Oratorio was something of an invention, not quite like anything that had come before. When the demand for Italian operas in London declined during the 1730s Handel, who had spent a couple decades making a rich living composing for the stage, formed this hybrid of Italian opera, English choral singing, and the Italian practice of presenting sung religious dramas in a spare manner free of elaborate staging, as opposed to opera, which often relied on scenery, stagecraft, spectacle, and acting (even if the singers were inept at it) to impress its audiences. For more about Handel‚Äôs pivot, see this post. This breed of oratorio was Handel‚Äôs greatest legacy, and also that of English music for a couple centuries. The English did not tolerate any composers, domestic or foreign, who would not fill their orders for music composed in this manner.\n\nThe Italian oratorio to which Handel looked for an element of his model has a bit of history itself, with different manifestations exhibiting different flavors. The oldest notable examples were composed by a Roman cleric and church musician, Giacomo Carissimi, around the middle of the seventeenth century. These early oratorios featured biblical stories cast in the new monodic styles which formed the praxis of the earliest operas. Carissimi‚Äôs most colorful examples combine recitative, proto arias, and motet-like choruses into a fast-moving Greek drama of biblical vignettes. Their name, oratorio, comes from their original venue, the Oratorio of Santissimo Crocifisso (the Oratory of the Most Blessed Crucifixion), where they were presented as a sort of adult Sunday school.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that these works are not sacred, in that they were not written for worship. Masses and motets are sacred but oratorios, even when written on sacred stories or themes, are a secular genre.\n\nThey seem a little bare and direct to our modern ears, pampered by a few hundred years of evolution with regard to melody, harmony and orchestration. You can hear an example of this fascinating genre here, an excerpt from Carissimi Latin oratorio Jeptha:\n\nIt sounds very much like the Roman and Venetian opera of the same time. You can see this post and this one for examples of that and note their similarity.\n\nWithin the next few decades the Italian oratorios found their way to theaters, and probably more often the performing spaces within palaces of wealthy patrons, like Cardinal Ottoboni, a checkered figure who lived lavishly and almost became pope in 1740, but for the fever which precipitated his death 3 days after the conclave. Ottoboni was a notable patron of music and other arts, collecting paintings, and supporting the careers of musicians like Corelli and Handel. Before he went to London to write Italian operas, Handel wrote a vivacious Italian oratorio in Rome, The Resurrection. It is based on models by Alessandro Scarlatti, written just a little later than Carissimi. Scarlatti‚Äôs operas are the most important link between the archaic-sounding operas of the middle 1600s and the very modern-sounding ones of the 1700s and beyond. In Scarlatti we see the crystallization of the tonal idiom and the practice of channeling monody into clearly delineated recitative and arias, the arias richly clothed in elegant and sonorous orchestral music.\n\nWhile he did most of his work in operas and chamber cantatas, Scarlatti also wrote some oratorios, more or less in the same cast. The First Murder, which dramatizes the story of Cain and Abel, is an example and, again, if you did not know the story, you would find little to distinguish it from one of his operas. This is the model to which Handel looked for his Roman oratorios of the 1700s, but it was combined with the English choral tradition for his English oratorios of the 1740s and later. In other words, oratorios like Messiah are a much different animal than the early oratorios Handel wrote in Italy and their Italian models. You can hear the elegant and moving idiom that so inspired Handel in Scarlatti‚Äôs setting Cain‚Äôs farewell to Adam and Eve which follows the tragic events of the central drama:\n\nScarlatti‚Äôs oratorios are not as well known as his operas, and I think that is probably justified. While beautiful and dramatically moving, they are not where he made his primary innovations, but they do brilliantly reflect the light of the place he did, which was opera. And so his operas are still his best-known contributions to Western culture. His oratorios are not really distinct from his operas. But Handel‚Äôs were, and so today we know his oratorios better than his operas, even though his operas are very well done. These stories are both great examples of the fact that our historical interest tends favor innovation, which is a perpetual theme in the history of art (read more about that here).\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like Aaron of Smart and Soulful Music to provide customized program notes especially for your next performance?

Gold has been attractive to humankind and symbolic of opulent wealth through all of recorded history. It has shaped human civilization and provided an evocative poetic metaphor. This week we explore music that was influenced by gold as it altered the course of history and provided poetic inspiration.\n\nAll That Glitters, Day 3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúGolden Columns‚Äù from Solomon by George Frideric Handel\n\nIt is a not terribly well-known fact that the greater part of George Frideric Handel‚Äôs career was devoted to composing Italian operas for the stages of London in the 1720s and 1730s. Handel had emigrated from his native Germany to London, by way of Italy in order to learn the craft of Italian opera from its source, and settled in the English capital early in the 1710s to keep busy and make his fortune writing opera after opera for the hungry audiences there, out-Italianing the Italians at their own game. Packed with vocal fireworks from beginning to end, Handel‚Äôs operas, and those of his contemporaries, staffed by native Italian singers (including many star castrati ‚Äì see this post for more on that), satisfied the public hunger which eventually reached fever pitch and inevitably declined. The 1730s must have been stressful for Handel and other composers of Italian opera in London as they sensed the receding of interest in the art form that had fed them so well for the past two decades- see this post for more about that. Handel, being the resourceful impresario that he was, pivoted and found even greater success, especially when one considers the weight of their legacy, in a more or less invented genre, the English language oratorio.\n\nEveryone knows Messiah, of course, from 1742, distinguished for, among other reasons, boasting an uninterrupted tradition of annual performances that can be traced back to its premiere, almost 300 years by now. But, if that is the only Handelian biblical oratorio that you know, I encourage you to make friends with a new one, like Saul, Samson, Jephtha, or Solomon.\n\nWhile the operas were essentially interchangeable, filled with overly dramatic plots of love triangles, austere and legendary heroes, and stiff mythology and magic, where any plot was essentially as good as any other and the story of the hour mattered little, the oratorios afforded Handel‚Äôs librettists the opportunity to reference and allegorize current political and military events in a way the operas did not. Plots for the mostly biblical oratorios were carefully chosen to reflect themes of current geopolitics and military conflicts. In this sense they are more akin to Lully‚Äôs tragedies-lyrique, in which the prologues especially, extended cantatas which preceded the proper drama, populated by characters representing mythological figures and corporeal virtues like fame and wisdom, sung glowing praise to their ‚Äúhero‚Äù, a thinly-veiled allusion to Sun King, Louis XIV, making particular reference to events of his personal and political life (read more about that here). While the libretti to Handel‚Äôs oratorios did not work quite in that effusive way, they were often written in response to similar events and generally inspired the Brits to take pride in their kingdom which was seen to be analogous to the nation of Israel, constantly under the hand of God‚Äôs protection, even in the midst of strife.\n\n1749 was indeed a high time for the monarchy and its subjects. The British crown was recently vindicated for having chosen the right side of the War of Austrian Succession, a decade-long series of conflicts scattered across the Western world, and yet another post-Reformation conflict which pitted Catholics against Protestants in the interest of temporal power, in this case over whom should rightly head the house of Hapsburg in Austrian regions. Having routed the Jacobists loyal to Charles of the Holy Roman Empire the alliance which asserted Maria Theresa‚Äôs ascension to the House of Habsburg, which included Britain, had prevailed, sealed by 1748‚Äôs peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. Handel had written the famous Fireworks music in honor of this event, and his glorious English language oratorio Solomon can be seen as a continuation of the sentiments of British pride which shaped the pyrotechnical celebration of the previous year. If you don‚Äôt know the festive and colorful Music for the Royal Fireworks, one of Handel‚Äôs greatest hits, check it out here:\n\nHandelian oratorios are dramatic, like operas. With the strange exception of Messiah, they all contain sung operatic roles, characterized by a specific singer over the course of the performance. The orchestra sometimes paints scenic pictures in instrumental movements, and the distinctive choruses function much like their ancient Greek counterparts, representing whichever group of Israelites is appropriate to comment on the situation at hand.\n\nSolomon is a curious choice for a drama as it is essentially free of it. There is no central conflict to speak of, no violence, little to resolve. The story all but violates Shakespeare‚Äôs adage about drama being ‚Äúlife with the boring parts removed‚Äù. Musically it is luminous, dramatically it is rather inert. The most furious drama is found in the central act, which dramatizes the famous story of Solomon‚Äôs judgement regarding the two mothers who claim to have born the same infant. But the first and third acts depict scenes that are not exactly packed with problems to solve. The first act begins with a vigorous celebration of the brand new Temple in Jerusalem, and proceeds to depict Solomon‚Äôs marriage (not really biblical ‚Äì Solomon was anything but monogamous), while the third act depicts a happy state visit from the Queen of Sheba who is suitably impressed by the splendor and prosperity Israel has reached under the wise king (the widely-known instrumental movement Arrival of the Queen of Sheba is the prelude to the third act). Not exactly thrilling drama, but full of splendorous spectacle that is clothed in glorious music through and through. The British subjects who consumed Solomon around the time of its premiere would have easily and inevitably associated the titular monarch with their reigning King George II, given the peace and prosperity enjoyed by the Empire.\n\nThe third act of Solomon is a masque, a show-within-a-show, much like a Lullian divertissement, staged for the entertainment and impression of the Queen of Sheba. Just before the masque concludes and the Queen is seen off, Zadok, the first high priest of Solomon‚Äôs new temple, sings his praises of Solomon‚Äôs pious vision in an enraptured love song to the imposing center of Israelite worship:\n\n‚ÄúGolden columns, fair and bright,\n\nCatch the mortals‚Äô ravish‚Äôd sight;\n\nRound their sides ambitious twine\n\nTendrils of the clasping vine;\n\nCherubims stand there display‚Äôd,\n\nO‚Äôer the ark their wings are laid:\n\nEv‚Äôry object swells with state,\n\nAll is pious, all is great.‚Äù\n\nThe tone of the text may strike us as obsequious and excessively worshipful, but the message is clear: the best of piety and statecraft commingle in the figure of Solomon and, by extension, King George II, Britain‚Äôs topical and most worthy equivalent. The lyrical and ecstatic aria, with its swooping string accompaniment, demonstrates a brand of writing, uniquely suited to the setting of the English language, which finds its roots in the elder English master Henry Purcell, whom Handel was known to have acknowledged as a superior composer to himself. The hearty corpus of orchestral sound here would have overwhelmed the daintier melismas of the Italian language, which is why the style is not to be found in Handel‚Äôs Italian vocal works. The sonically impressive chorus that follows Zadok‚Äôs aria is another feature that would simply not have fit into his Italian operas, but in the unstaged oratorios became a most effective tool with which to enhance the scope and splendour that would otherwise have been created by operatic scenery and stagecraft. You can listen to it, one of Handel‚Äôs most impressive choruses, here:\n\nThe 1730s must have been a stressful time for Handel as he struggled to come to terms with the declining viability of Italian opera production in London, but thanks to this turn of fortune, and especially his great resourcefulness, we have the much different, and equally gratifying, experience of his great English language oratorios, top-notch musical dramas which open a fascinating window into the English view of European history and politics. While it probably would have surprised him to hear it in the 1710s, as he set about to take London by storm with Italian operas, the English oratorios have became Handel‚Äôs greatest legacy, and perhaps that of all of English music.\n\n‚Äî\n\nWould you like this featured track in your own personal collection to listen to anytime you want?
