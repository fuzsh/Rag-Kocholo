        "text": "(This text has been automatically translated by Google translate)\n\nTheir contributions to the genre have been almost collectively forgotten, so that it is hardly realized that almost all French composers of the late nineteenth century had some large-scale religious oration to their credit. Among them was Jules Massenet (1842-1912), whose lyrical and exotic-oriental-inspired operas made him the uncrowned king of the French opera world at the time. Two of his religious… works are recorded on these CDs for the first time, namely \"Marie-Magdeleine\" (1873) and the \"Mystère\" (1874). The first-mentioned work is the most extensive in scope. It tells the crucifixion story from the perspective of Mary Magdalene. In 1903 the work was also performed scenically - like an ordinary opera -, not incomprehensible given the unabashedly dramatic nature of the music, for example in the scene at Golgotha. The music that Massenet added for this occasion has also been recorded and can be 'inserted' by the listener. On a smaller scale is \"Eve\", a lyrically rather bizarre version of the fall. Adam and Eve come across as a kind of ruthless erotomaniac. For example, after Eve takes the fatal bite, Adam says, \"Your lips have touched mine. What have you done? What powerful feeling is running through my veins? Let us love one another!\" Then they are chased out of paradise. Massenet's music is, where necessary, catchy dramatic as well as compelling and sensual (see above) and the soloists and the Choeur et Orestre Français d ' Oratorio with conductor Jean-Pierre Loré put this in the spotlight.
