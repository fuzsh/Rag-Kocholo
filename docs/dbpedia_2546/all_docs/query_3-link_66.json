        "meta_description": "Embark on an olfactory journey inspired by the vibrant streets of Prague and the timeless elegance of Paris. This perfume juxtaposes the bustling energy of the city, where each day blends seamlessly into the next, with the serene stillness of ancient churches, where time stands still. Experience the convergence of these two worlds in a single moment of presence. The fragrance begins with a luminous blend of rare Madagascar mandarin and Egyptian neroli, symbolizing illumination. Its citrus-floral opening is crisp, clean, and utterly distinctive. Transitioning gracefully, it evolves into a spiritual composition of incense, cedar, and jasmine at its heart. Finally, an accord of opoponax resin and patchouli oil anchors the base, imparting a classic balsamic warmth that contrasts with a cooling accent, revealing darkness as a conduit to light. Key Ingredients: Top Notes: Hand-pressed mandarin oil, Neroli Middle Notes: Olibanum, Cedar, Jasmine Base Notes: Patchouli, Opoponax",

        "text": "An olfactory work that was created on real and imaginary journey between Prague and Paris. The perfume drawing contrast between the dynamics of the city, where the day already belongs to tomorrow, and the space of old church, under whose vaults time has stopped. The contrast of two moments that can be connected in one moment. The moment of becoming present. The first touch belongs to the rare Madagascar mandarin and Egyptian neroli, which symbolize light. The citrus-floral opening is elegantly tart, clean, and unique. Gradually it turns into a spiritual scent of incense and cedar, which is complemented by jasmine in the heart. An accord of opoponax resin together with patchouli oil closes the base of the perfume with a classic balsamic and cooling accent, an expression of darkness than lets us see light.\n\nTOP NOTES: hand-pressed mandarin oil, neroli\n\nMIDDLE NOTES: olibanum, cedar, cedar atlas, jasmine\n\nBASE NOTES: patchouli, opoponax"
