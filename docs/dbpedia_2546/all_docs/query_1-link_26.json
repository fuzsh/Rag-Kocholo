        "text": "Long called \"The Cathedral\" by the martégaux, the most imposing of the town's churches characteristic of Provencal architecture and Baroque decor with an Italian influence has been classified as Historic Monuments since 1947.\n\nBuilt between 1670 and 1680, it testifies to the prosperity of the city in the 17th century and the attachment of the island's inhabitants who participated in its financing.\n\nThe facade has two levels separated by a volumetric cornice with modillions.\n\nOn the first level, a double colonnade frames the richly decorated wooden door, dominated by a Virgin and Child in a carved niche. The statue and the portal have been classified as a Historic Monument since 1908. The fluted columns and pilasters punctuate the facade and are topped with Corinthian capitals. The volumetric cornice decorated with modillions, rosettes and dentils, projecting to the right of the pilasters and columns, is interrupted by a broken pediment creating a play of light and shadow.\n\nThe second level, more classic, is simply animated by bare pilasters and crowned by a triangular pediment whose sculpture dates from the 19th century.\n\nInside the church, the spacious single nave with seven bays and a flat apse is covered with a compartmentalized wooden ceiling, designed to accommodate a painted decoration never before created. A volumetric cornice repeating the exterior decor runs along the walls.\n\nOn the upper floor, very soberly decorated with pilasters and paneled capitals, large windows flood the church with light.\n\nIn the choir, the high altar has a faux marble decoration and its gilding is similar to the altar of the Annonciade chapel. It welcomes the Blessed Sacrament. A large painting of the Crucifixion from the 19th century stands out in the canopy-shaped decor. The walnut pulpit was made by the master Martegal carpenter Etienne Darbon who donated it to the church in 1679.\n\nThe gallery organ, built around 1850 by Prosper Antoine Moitessier, is located above the entrance porch of the church. The buffet, classified as a historic monument in 1908, is of Italian inspiration, the rich gold leaf ornaments incorporate decorative elements from the building. The instrumental part is in the French style of the time with 26 stops, spread over 2 keyboards as well as pedal boards and 1500 pipes.\n\nThe brotherhoods commissioned altar paintings for their chapels and constituted an important clientele for the artists. Two works deserve particular attention:\n\n- “Martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alexandria” by Jean Baptiste Daniel (around 1636-1720). This painting was transferred to the church in 1892 and classified in 1957. On the cut sides of the church choir, we find the aftermath of the martyrdom of the Saint. The low-angle treatment, the luminous contrasts and the attitudes accentuate the movement of the figures and give this work dynamism and power.\n\n- “Saint-Honoré, Saint-Antoine, Saint-Michel” created in 1694 by Michel Serre and commissioned by the rich brotherhood of bakers.\n\nThe 15-year restoration campaign was awarded the heritage ribbon in 2000."
