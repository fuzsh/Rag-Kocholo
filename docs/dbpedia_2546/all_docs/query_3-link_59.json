        "text": "Recorded April 15th 2022 at the Temple of Light at Ananda Village\n\nComposed after Swami Kriyananda visited the Holy Land in 1983, \"Christ Lives\" brilliantly captures the profoundly inspiring and uplifting experience of Christ’s presence there. An illustrated oratorio, Christ Lives is a contemporary Oratorio that vividly brings to life the deep meaning of Christ's life.\n\nThis is Swami Kriyananda’s introduction: “I wrote this oratorio after a visit to Israel, which we in the West call the Holy Land. I meditated. It’s a very different oratorio from any other you might find. I meditated in the various scared places. I felt the presence of Christ there, and I prayed to Him and He gave me these melodies. You can take that as you will, but to me it’s a reality. The melodies express the vibration of His presence which I felt there. It was a very holy visit for me. I hope you will feel His presence.”\n\nAs music alone can do, the Oratorio reaches the soul with both the message and spirit of Christ's life, and his call to all seekers to awaken the Divine within."
