        "text": "Christmas Oratorio by J.S. Bach\n\nOur Wednesday chorale just before Christmas is not famous, not dramatic, not flashy or even particularly memorable. As far as we know, Bach used it only once. But that once, in Bach's Christmas Oratorio, is a thing of beauty, luminous and numinous, full of meaning and of hope.\n\nThe chorale melody was written by Heinrich Albert, and was first published in 1642. Bach selected this tune for the closing chorale of the fifth cantata of his Oratorio, yet as happens so often with Bach, he (and/or his librettist) hunted for and found exactly the right verse from another chorale text attached to the melody.\n\nHere's the context: The last two cantatas form a narrative pair which relates the story of the Magi, as told in the gospel according to Matthew. In Cantata 5, after a celebratory opening chorus, the drama begins with the search of the three wayfarers for the newborn child; they are led by a brilliant star. Later, Herod directs his scholars and seers to find the babe. Bach draws two related themes from this material. First, we are told to 'seek him in the heart'; in an extended trio, the soprano and tenor, who languish while waiting for salvation, are told by the alto, 'Hush! He's already here!'. Then, in the closing sequence, Bach explores the nature of our hearts, which are likened to the dark stable; yet even here, even in this darkness, the brightness of salvation can shine.\n\nHere's the chorale verse, by Johann Franck (1655), which closes this sequence and the cantata itself:\n\nSuch a heart's chamber\n\nneed be no ornate prince's hall;\n\nit could be even a dark pit;\n\nyet as soon as thy beams of grace peep in,\n\nit seems to be full of sunshine.\n\nTo express this idea in this context, nothing could be more effective than the humble melody which Bach has chosen. The chorale is the perfect musical representation of the coming of light to a dark place.\n\nLord knows that here in this moment--the shortest days of the year, the omicron variant, strife and dissonance and challenges all around us--we need light wherever we can find it. One source is beautiful music, and that is one thing I can offer. Take a little time to explore the sequence and the entire cantata. A full score is attached; here's a link to Pamela Dellal's translation; and below you can find links to each movement in a very nice performance by the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, conducted by Peter Dijkstra.\n\nMay we all find--and even create--some light in the darkness!\n\n43.
