        "text": "The Church of Saint Mary Magdalene (Église Sainte-Marie-Madeleine), commonly known as \"the big Madelene\" due to its robust silhouette and baroque dome, is a notable landmark in the Old Lille district of Lille. The church's origins trace back to 1233 when it was first established as a parish chapel dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene, outside the medieval city walls. It became integrated into the city with the expansion of the city's fortifications by Vauban in 1667, which subsequently led to the demolition and reconstruction of the parish.\n\nConstruction of the current structure began in 1675 under the direction of François Vollant, with significant architectural contributions completed by 1707, including a distinctive dome and elaborate facade that mixes Flemish Renaissance and Baroque styles with classical Greek elements. The church was consecrated by the Archbishop of Cologne, Joseph Clement of Bavaria, but suffered damage during the Austrian siege of 1708, leading to extensive restorations that concluded in 1713.\n\nThe church served the community until 1989 when it was decommissioned from worship due to safety concerns and was later transformed into an exhibition space as part of the Lille 2004 cultural events. It has since hosted works by artists such as Miwa Yanagi, Chiharu Shiota, and Erwin Redl, among others.\n\nIn 2008, the church's facade was restored, highlighting its unique architectural blend. The interior, shaped like a Greek cross, features a central rotunda with the choir and two main chapels. Notable artworks include a painting of The Resurrection of Lazarus by Jacob van Oost the Younger and four large paintings by André Corneille Lens, depicting episodes from the life of Mary Magdalene, along with historic stained glass windows by master glassmaker Olivier Durieux.\n\nToday, the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene stands as a historic monument, celebrated both for its architectural beauty and its adaptive reuse as a cultural venue, enriching Lille's heritage and cultural landscape."
