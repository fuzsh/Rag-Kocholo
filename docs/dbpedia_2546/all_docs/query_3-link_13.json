        "text": "Together with the opera and cantata, the oratorio stands as a major development in the barque vocal music. Like an opera, an oratorio is a large-scale composition for chorus vocal soloists, and orchestra; it is usually set to a narrative text. Oratorio differs from opera in that i.e. has no acting, scenery or costumes. Most Oratorios are based on biblical stories, but usually they are not intended for religious services. Today they are performed in either concert halls or churches.\n\nAn oratorio contains a succession of choruses, arias, duets, recitives, and orchestral interludes. The chorus is especially important and serves either to comment on or to participate in the drama. A narratorâ€™s recitative usually relate the story and connect one piece with another. Oratorios (which sometimes last over 2 hours) are longer then cantatas and have more of a story line.\n\nOratorios first appeared in early seventeenth-centry Italy as musical dramatizations of biblical so tires and were performed in prayer halls called oratorios. During the baroque period, the oratorio spread to other countries and assumed many forms. Messiah, by George Frederic Handel, has for decades been the best-known and most-loved oratorio."
