Its author has spent a lifetime to make these stories. I have known Howard since he was working on his doctorate. I kept in touch with him at the Eaton conferences at UCR and was impressed when his fiction began appearing. Few can do both criticism and fiction (I can, but not much scifilitcrit escapes my desk). Even fewer do so as well as Howard; indeed, very nearly none. His novels have built for him a reputation for scientifically savvy fiction, with an added insight into social issues. He had melded the social aspect of science fiction with a respect for the hard driver of technology, in its many aspects.\n\nI’m a novelist, not a critic. I enjoy Howard’s deft scene-setting, his audacious imagination, and his sense of plot. I think plot is the hardest aspect of fiction, for a working writer. I have learned this the hard way myself. I am a research physicist and professor, with writing as a hobby that has rewarded me well. I have not written for the straight ‘literary’ market, preferring the true current of modern science fiction—fiction for people who care about the future and like to think about it. Howard is such an accomplished, lit-savvy writer. I have commissioned stories from him for the original anthologies I edited. I have also seen him speak dozens of times, and he is a commanding presence with a canny knowledge of how to shape his message to his audience—any who speak at the Eaton Conference know it’s a competitive event. He holds his own.\n\nLet me make the case for Howard as specifically a writer of science fiction. Throughout this century, conventional literature persistently avoided thinking about conceptually altered tomorrows. The rapid march of science and technology was just plain unsettling to the literati. Conventional literature retreated into a realist posture, with fiction of ever-smaller compass. Henry James and H.G. Wells engaged in a classic debate on the matter during World War I, quite a nasty affair that ruined their friendship. In the end, awash in the tides of fashion, the novel of character, foregrounding personal relations, claimed the high ground of orthodox fiction. James won his argument, but surrendered the future to the genre that would increasingly set the terms of social debate—science fiction. Though Aldous Huxley, Nevil Shute, Italo Calvino, George Orwell, and Vladimir Nabokov did impressive work along science fictional lines, they were little emulated. The real work was done in the genre. By such as Howard.\n\nLike immense time-binding discussions, genres allow ideas to be developed and traded, and for variations to be spun down through decades. Players ring changes on each other—a steppin’-out jazz band that inventively agrees on its central tune, jivin’—not a solo concert in a plush auditorium. Contrast this with too often self-consciously solemn “serious” fiction, which supposedly proceeds from canonical classics believed to stand outside of time, deserving awe, looming great and intact by themselves.\n\nGenre origins still carry a class burden. Some in genre fiction still worry we’ll scarcely be invited to the high literary tea, if we have so many companions with such muddy boots. The difference between highbrow and low—between Eliot and Poe, between mainstream and SF—is not one that can be mapped by the conventional criteria of criticism. Poe was more a formalist than Eliot, in many ways—and less given than Eliot to overt lecturing and preachiness (two often criticized SF mannerisms). Instead, the essential difference between their works and standings is not one of aesthetics or of some subtler metaphysical nature, but of the two writers’ antithetical social and economic positions. Poe was a popular, market-driven writer, a “magazinist,” while Eliot was supported by a high culture with subtle, indirect patronage. And still, sf/fantasy dominates the few still-standing fiction magazines. Realist fiction blooms in the hothouses of small, funded little magazines, and a few mainstreamers like The New Yorker.\n\nI digress into this history because this speaks to the structure that universities erect around literature. Science fiction is the most important market-generated genre, and it intersects with the big drivers of the last century and more—science and engineering. It has the future in its bones. That’s why it has become a dominant genre in our time, with many films and novels in the public eye.\n\nThe Eaton Collection at UCR is at the fore in carrying forward a genuine revolution, directed toward the reality of how our scientific culture and literature interact. They have the world’s largest and best collection of the literature of the fantastic. Howard comes from that movement and has become the foremost graduate UCR has produced from over thirty years of effort in the Eaton tradition.\n\nHoward is a true generalist—he can write criticism, commercial fiction, articles and reviews and much else. He lectures very well, has warm personal skills, and works harder than he probably should. Most of the stories in this volume are from a single magazine, Analog. It is based on the assumption that hard SF must be understood primarily as an attempt to induce the feeling (if not the reality) of conceptual breakthrough. Howard’s work does just that. He repeatedly seeks to use the tools and metaphors of science to evoke the splendor of breakout ideas, where our future lies.\n\nHe’s a master of the form. This collection tells us how and why.\n\n—Gregory Benford"
