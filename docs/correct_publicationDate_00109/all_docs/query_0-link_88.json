        "text": "This novel, written back in 1979, has a very interesting premise: Some physicists in 1998 have discovered what they think is a way to send messages back in time to 1963. The problem is, how can the people in 1963 understand what they're seeing, assuming they even see the message? Not only that, what kind of message can one send? If you send a message that creates a paradox, does the message actually get through?\n\nFascinating stuff. Unfortunately, while these ideas would be enough to make a magnificent 80-page short story, they have been stretched out to the limit in this behemoth of a novel, diluted by countless pages of pure boredom. For every page where you get to see how the politics of controversial results work in the world of science or how Benford speculates that these messages might be sent, received and interpreted, you must read 5 pages about a dinner party that has no bearing on the plot or 8 pages about a physicist's relationship with his live-in girlfriend that just doesn't lead anywhere interesting (given the number of pages devoted to it).\n\nI read this book quickly, more out of frustration than anything else. I kept waiting to get back to the meaty parts, which were great, but then I'd get frustrated again waiting for another development. The ending was also somewhat unsatisfying for me, but that's just a matter of taste. It was hardly implausible, if I dare to use that word when describing speculative fiction.\n\nAnother big, stand-alone novel, but I felt this one was a big improvement over Timescape. In this story, archaeologists discover a strange artifact that turns out to have some extraordinary physical properties. Half of the book is politics as the main characters try to find out a way to continue to study the artifact in the face of a nasty political situation and even nastier politically motivated characters. This part reads a bit like a soap opera. It is engaging (much more so than the various Timescape subplots), but not the meat of the story.\n\nTruly, the strength of this book lies in the methodical process of discovery, as facts are slowly revealed about the artifact. The politics of academia and research ring true (no surprise, given Benford's academic background), and I really enjoyed the very slow \"unraveling\" of the strange artifact. Near the end, the plausibility factor got in the way just a bit (very similar to Brin's problems with \"Earth\", actually), but that's only a quibble. If you can find this little gem in a used bookstore, snag it for an enjoyable weekend read."
