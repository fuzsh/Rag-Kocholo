A man contemplates sex, genre, and more because he has found the ability to make humanity either entirely male or entirely female.\n\nGorgonoids • (2016) • short fiction by Leena Krohn\n\nPoor. Gorgonoids are being on a computer. You can see them. Does that make them real. Deep thoughts, but no story.\n\nVacancy for the Post of Jesus Christ • (1992) • short story by Kojo Laing\n\nPoor.

A poet who is trapped by a race of warlike, space-faring, dinosaurs starts a poetry competition with a being who is so powerful that he might as well be a god.\n\nStory of Your Life • (1998) • novella by Ted Chiang\n\nGreat. One of the most brilliant science fiction stories ever written. The story of alien first contact is told with a strong focus on very smart scientific thoughtfulness. The story of a mother and her relationship with her daughter is deeply human and nuanced in the way of the best Fiction.\n\nCraphound • (1998) • short story by Cory Doctorow\n\nGreat.

An interesting story that highlights the self destructive impulses of humanity and the true weirdness that alien life would exhibit.\n\nThe Slynx (excerpt) • short fiction by Татьяна Толстая? [as by Tatyana Tolstaya]\n\nAverage. A picture of a mutilated and changed Russian town in the period of time “after the blast,” but not so distant that people cannot remember what came before.\n\nBaby Doll • (2007) • novelette by Johanna Sinisalo (trans. of Baby Doll 2002)\n\nGood.
