        "text": "The Story Picks Up Speed!\n\nI wasn't wild about the first novel in this series but I had a feeling it was setting the stage for very exciting things. I'm so glad I hung in there! Nigel is in his element aboard Lancer, a ship modeled after the Mare Marginis wreck. Peopled with a crew of experts in every field, the ship is exploring the universe. I finally begin to admire Nigel and understand why he is the hero of this story. Nigel is a frontiersman. He is looking for the truth and nothing will stand in his way of discovering it. Lancer is tracing a radio transmission far into space, and we see Nigel grow older as it takes years to reach their destination. He tenaciously holds onto his desire to make contact with other life forms and to prove his theory that machine life is up to no good out there in the universe.\n\nMeanwhile back on earth, strange creatures have been deposited (by guess who?) into the world's oceans. The story alternates between Nigel on Lancer, and a new hero on earth, Warren. In a chilly turn of events, we are introduced to the \"swarmers\", alien sea creatures that bombard ships and devour the humans inside, making sea travel impossible. Warren is a shipwreck survivor, clinging to a make shift raft and beating starvation and dehydration by killing and eating the lone swarmers that attack him.\n\nOn Lancer, earth's transmissions take years to reach the crew, so they are not yet aware of the swarmers. Instead they are focused on a planet called Isis, where organic life forms have evolved to communicate through radio waves in order to outsmart the machine life that has suppressed them.\n\nThere is so much action in this novel. Everything starts to fit together and I understand why Benford spent so much time on the themes presented in \"In the Ocean of Night.\" Nigel is rushing toward the Galactic Center and the story is picking up speed! I can't wait to listen to the next book!\n\nWasn't able to even finish it\n\nWhat would have made Across the Sea of Suns better?\n\nA point to the story?\n\nWhat was most disappointing about Gregory Benfordâ€™s story?\n\nMinutes upon minutes of garble and unintelligent dialog. Unable to get a connection to a story that is all over the place. C\n\nWho would you have cast as narrator instead of Maxwell Caulfield and Stefan Rudnicki ?\n\nThe change of voice and person is significant ant troubling. Using the same tone of voice and way of reading would make it much easier a listen.\n\nWhat character would you cut from Across the Sea of Suns?\n\nn/a\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nBased on book 1 I ventured into book 2. But I'm thoroughly done with the series based on this example."
