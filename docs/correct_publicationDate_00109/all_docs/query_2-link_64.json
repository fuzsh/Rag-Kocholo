        "text": "Gregory Benford\n\nRepresented by John Silbersack\n\nGregory Benford, author of top-selling novels, including JUPITER PROJECT, ARTIFACT, AGAINST INFINITY, EATER, AND TIMESCAPE, is that unusual creative combination of scientist scholar and talented artist; his stories capture readers’ hearts and minds with imaginative leaps into the future of science and of us.\n\nA University of California faculty member since 1971, Benford has conducted research in astrophysics and plasma turbulence theory and experiment. His published scientific articles include well over a hundred papers in fields of physics such as condensed matter, particle physics, plasmas and mathematical physics, and several in biological conservation.\n\nOften called hard science fiction, Benford’s stories take physics into inspired realms. What would happen if cryonics worked and people, frozen, were awoken 50 years in the future? What might we encounter in other dimensions? How about sending messages across time? And finding aliens in our midst? The questions that physics and scientists ask, Benford’s imagination explores."
