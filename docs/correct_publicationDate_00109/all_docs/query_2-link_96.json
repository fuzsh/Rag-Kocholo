        "text": "Eater by Gregory Benford\n\n(May 2000, Eos, US$24, 340 pages, ISBN: 0380974363)\n\nRating: \"B+\" (me), 3.7/5 (Amazon) -- an uneven reworking of a classic SF theme, featuring some of Benford's best writing yet. But....\n\nThe Eater is a small black hole that enters the Solar system in 2023, and opens a conversation with the astronomers who discover it. Hijinks ensue.\n\nThe book opens with some of the strongest writing in Benford's career -- the three major characters come to life in prose that's as good as any I've read anywhere. Channing Knowlton, an astronaut-turned-astronomer who is dying of breast cancer, is particularly well-drawn. And her husband Benjamin, a senior astronomer at Mauna Kea, and Kingsley Dart, Britain's Astronomer Royal, once Channing's lover and a master scientist-politician, are very fine indeed. Benford's portrait of scientists at work is wonderful, unmatched by any other novelist I know. Reading the first 100 pages, I got that primo creamy rush from great writing, neat ideas and wonderful characters....\n\nBut -- when the politicians enter the story, greatness trails off to competence (though still with flashes of the Pure Quill) -- and when the shoot-em-up starts -- well, hell, it's still pretty good, but not magic, y'know? Drama turns to melodrama, and a bold remake of 'Mankind meets a Cosmic Being' becomes just another thriller. Sigh.\n\nBut those first 115 pages -- wow. Worth the price of admission.\n\nEater is an improvement over Cosm (1998), which featured a great physics idea married to a silly thriller plot. I find Benford a frustrating novelist -- his ideas are great, his science is diamond-hard, his writing is always competent and sometimes inspired -- so why don't his novels click? This is his 26th novel, of which I've read maybe twenty. A couple of the Galactic Center series were amazing -- but, sigh, the last couple were awful. He writes great pop-science articles, excellent short fiction, and has been a trufan forever.... Maybe it's just me?\n\nOr maybe not -- a scan of Amazon shows his recent books have reader ratings ranging from 0 to 5. So, YBBAMV (your Benford book-appreciation may vary) -- I'm sure I'll keep reading them, hoping he gets the mix right, grumbling when he doesn't, and enjoying the good parts regardless....\n\nLinks:\n\nAmazon readers' ratings: 3.7/5, 6 readers, range 2/5 to 5/5.\n\nSF Site review of Eater\n\nThe Science Fiction Century: this wonderful meditation on the interplay between science and SF is one of the 10 best critical essays in the history of our genre. From F&SF 9-99 (slightly revised in Nebula Awards Showcase 2000).\n\nClimate engineering: possibly his best science column yet; highly recommended.\n\nReview by Peter D Tillman; more of Peter D Tillman's reviews can be found at: SF Site and Amazon.com.
