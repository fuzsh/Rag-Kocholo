In this sequel to GREAT SKY RIVER, the galactic struggle between machine life and fleshly forms continues. Here cyborg entities, whose distant goal is a kind of godlike transcendence of the galaxy, use a 'cosmic string' to dismantle a planet. Such a story may be lacking in human interest (as far as some readers are concerned) but the physics and cosmology are up to date and the vistas which unfold are truly mind bending.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition, p. 373.
