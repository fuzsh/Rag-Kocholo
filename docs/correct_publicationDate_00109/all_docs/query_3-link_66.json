        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nREPRESENTATIVE WORKS\n\nOVERVIEWS AND GENERAL STUDIES\n\nAPPEAL OF SCIENCE FICTION TO YOUNG READERS\n\nFUTURISM IN YOUNG ADULT SCIENCE FICTION\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nGenre or mode of speculative literature targeted at young audiences which focuses on issues related to technological, scientific and futuristic theorization.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRobert A. Heinlein, the prolific author of such young adult science fiction novels as Starship Troopers (1959) and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), commented in his 1957 lecture titled \"Science Fiction: Its Nature, Faults and Virtues\": \"A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method.\" As such, science fiction as a literary genre, or \"mode\" as many critics prefer, considers the implications of knowledge and its ultimate course—particularly with regards to the potential of applied science and technology. Juvenile and young adult science fiction as a subgenre is a rapidly expanding field with many of the same trends, though with slight alterations made in deference to the needs of a younger readership. The term \"science fiction\" itself is sometimes thought to be an all-encompassing term for any media form concerned with these themes, therefore when commenting specifically about science fiction literature, \"mode\" is often considered a more accurate categorization.\n\nSuzanne Elizabeth Reid has proposed that the \"main motivation behind science fiction, and the source of its power and appeal, is escape from the strictures of everyday thinking, allowing the imagination to see beyond what we have been taught is real and possible.\" In short, it explores the fantastic through rational means. As a result, science fiction is commonly associated with fantasy, indeed it is regarded by many as an offshoot of the form. However, where fantasy uses magic to rationalize that which is not understood, it is mankind's own cognitive intuition that is the driving force behind science fiction. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) is often credited as the first novel to demonstrate the early precepts of science fiction. Relying upon the power of Dr. Frankenstein's learned understanding of biological processes to create his creature, Shelley's story utilized science as the means for literary propulsion rather than a mystical infusion of omniscient design or fairy-borne magic. While Shelley's basis for the creation of Frankenstein's creature was shaky in terms of its application of actual science, science fiction does not necessarily arise from science fact, an ethos which is particularly true in young adult works. This mode of literature is meant more as an examination of the hypothetical possibilities arising from the application of science, not simply a factual restatement of proven theoreticals—which, in the case of young adult works, are likely to be either too complicated or dull to be appreciated. Regardless, Shelley established a beachhead in a new territory of implicative conjecture that today is seen as the genesis of science fiction.\n\nIn spite of Shelley's pioneering work, young adult and juvenile science fiction developed at a much slower pace than its adult counterpart. Whereas children's fantasy owns a strong tradition of classic tales, among them Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), young adult science fiction yielded no nineteenth-century masters who could cement a standard upon which other children's book authors might later build. And yet children were among the earliest converts to the genre, appropriating more adult-centric works of science fiction due to their natural inclination toward the adventurous heroes, fantastic universes, and creature-laden worlds created by such early giants in the field as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Those authors, like many others in the genre, likely intended to cultivate an adult readership. Today, however, books like Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1869), Wells' The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), and The War of the Worlds (1898), and Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World (1912) are categorized as children's science fiction, even though they retain a large adult fan base. Changing styles and tastes have altered the landscape of science fiction, and the styles and shorter lengths of these books may be responsible for their reclassification. But perhaps more culpable for this confusion of audience is the fact that, throughout much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were only marginal differences between juvenile and adult science fiction. Few true examples from that era even exist, thus establishing a firm \"first\" children's science fiction work is difficult, with little accord between scholars. One possible candidate for this milestone is Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies (1863). Jessica Yates has argued that Kingsley's text attempted—like many early science fiction novels—to combine elements of fantasy and science fiction by presenting \"a synthesis of children's belief in fairies, the doctrines of Christianity and the new theories of evolution and the origin of species, and was much more successful in communicating his ideas about the wonder of God's creation in this fantastic form than in his pamphleteering and adult novels.\" Another early fusion of fantasy and science fiction came in the form of L. Frank Baum's The Master Key (1901). Featuring aspects of science as well as future science fiction mainstays as robots and other automatons, the story's plot centered around the principles of electricity—it is subtitled \"An Electrical Fairy Tale\"—and features appearances of such futuristic inventions as food tablets and stun guns. Baum had an early literary interest in science, and electronic creatures are scattered throughout his more famous \"Oz\" books, not to mention the very personification of science and fantasy in the figure of the great Wizard of Oz, who memorably uses the principles of science to his advantage. The Wizard is, in a sense, an amalgam of science and fantasy, using skills which were acquired in \"our\" universe to sham his way into a position of authority in the more fantasy-oriented Oz, thus earning him the magically-inclined moniker of \"Wizard.\"\n\nPerhaps the first true children's science fiction came in the form of the pulp stories that dominated the late Victorian Era. Known variously as penny dreadfuls or dime novels, the cheaply-produced texts—often quickly written, of short length, and packed with thrilling adventures—were among the first literary works written exclusively for children and teens. An early prototype came in the form of the Frank Reade, Jr. stories originated by Harry Cohen (who wrote under the pen name Harry Enton) and made famous by their longtime caretaker, Luis Senarens. First published in 1874, the series starred boy genius inventor Frank and featured an impressive array of mechanical devices like helicopter airships and carriage-pulling robots. Further fantastical dime stories followed, including the Tom Edison, Jr. series (1891–1892)—which was written under the pseudonym of Phillip Reade—and the Edward Stratemeyer Syndicate series Tom Swift, which was written by Howard Garis (also known as Victor Appleton) for much of its 1910–1941 duration. By 1930, American publisher Hugo Gernsback had created two separate pulp magazines dedicated exclusively to science fiction stories: Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories. Gernsback is also credited with the derivation of the term \"science fiction,\" a name he created after first experimenting with the name \"scientifiction\" for the stories in his magazines. Today, the Science Fiction Achievement Award, presented annually by the World Science Fiction Society, is called the \"Hugo\" in his honor. Of these early stories, Margaret Esmonde classifies two early science fiction models as having been born from this era: the \"space opera\" stories, concerned with adventures in space, and the so-called \"gadgets\" stories, which tended to center around the creation of wild inventions. Gernsback's magazines were influential in helping bring science fiction into the literary mainstream, as well as providing higher quality pulp stories than had been previously available. Further, they provided a wealth of inspiration to a later generation of writers who had grown up on the stories themselves.\n\nOne of the authors inspired by Gernsback's pulp periodicals was Robert A. Heinlein, who is largely credited with the creation of the first science fiction story targeted specifically for teens. In his 1947 novel Rocket Ship Galileo, Heinlein tells the unlikely story of three boys traveling by homemade rocket ship to the moon where they find a Nazi military base. His story appropriated aspects of the precursory pulp stories, including cliffhanger chapters, high-paced plotting, and conversational styles of dialogue that featured popular slang. Additionally, in a nod to his younger readership, his explanations of scientific details were brief and only loosely based in fact—a characteristic included for clarity and brevity, due to the presumptive shorter attention spans of children. Though Heinlein initially found it difficult to acquire a publisher for the story due to its outlandish nature, its eventual popular success allowed Heinlein to publish a children's science fiction novel annually for the next decade. His continued success in an exclusively children's subgenre soon expanded the horizon for such famed authors as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Andre Norton.\n\nStill, as compared to the field of fantasy, science fiction for children was very much in its infancy with little appreciable tradition prior to these early pioneers. Of this early era, Jessica Yates suggests that the paucity of early twentieth-century children's sci-ence fiction may have been due to the fact that \"because children willingly accepted magic, there was no need for a pseudo-scientific explanation for supernatural events,\" thus \"the juvenile SF published from the nineteenth century onwards, comparable in popular appeal to other children's genres like the historical novel or adventure yarn, had no market leaders who combined popularity with quality, and whose names are recalled today.\" However, since the 1950s, juvenile science fiction has seen both its profile and audience base grow dramatically to become one of the most popular forms of literature for children. Though, despite its growing popularity, many adults continue to regard the subgenre with a wary eye. Children's science fiction author Janice Bogstad notes that even though \"we may speak of the 'maturation' of the genre during the 1960's, it is undeniable most individuals outside the field (of children's science fiction) or only tangentially connected to it by the more popular media still associate the genre with its pulp origins and so with bad writing, poor technique, and juvenile story-lines.\" While that image has been slow to change, as children who are exposed to quality works of juvenile science fiction become adults themselves, they continue to propagate the genre by sharing those titles with their own children, thus continuing and strengthening the genre's reputation. Perhaps reflective of this growth, several works of science fiction have been honored with the Newbery Award, the highest honor for American children's literature, among them Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time (1962), Robert C. O'Brien's Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971), and Lois Lowry's The Giver (1993).\n\nWhile young adult science fiction is difficult to characterize as a whole—given the diverse range of works in its canon—it does differ from its more adult counterparts in several distinct fashions. Most prominent is the youth of its primary protagonists—a presentation style meant to equate the story's hero with that of the reader—and a generally more optimistic tone. Of this latter characteristic, critics speculate that authors and publishers often purposely instill their narratives with hopeful outcomes with the intent of both protecting the young reader and presenting more positive images of potential futures. However, as the field evolves, a wider array of visions about possible future timelines has begun to creep into the subgenre, many offering a more cautionary, and in some cases, dark outlook on the world of tomorrow. Even with these defining characteristics, the cross-pollinization of thematic elements between juvenile and adult science fiction has continued to make classification difficult. Noted children's literature critic Perry Nodelman has suggested that works of young adult science fiction \"form a distinguishable sub-genre only because their main characters are almost always youngsters themselves, and because, in comparison with other SF, they tend to describe less complicated situations in a simpler way.\" Further, the hazy distinction between magic and science in many works purported to be science fiction has caused some scholars to speculate that \"true\" children's science fiction is uncommon. Farah Mendlesohn has opined that too many works of young adult science fiction \"when scrutinized turn out to be fantasy, or to focus on issues other than science, or social science, or in some other way to somehow not quite feel like science fiction. And there (is) a clear sense that the younger the child, the more restricted the choice.\" This difficulty in distinguishing between genres has also crossed over into critical analyses. For instance, author Samuel J. Lundwall has categorized science fiction as having six basic types of stories: pure adventure, horror, social satire, scientific speculation, sword and sorcery, and literary experiment. And yet, many critics maintain that the \"sword and sorcery\" and \"horror\" threads are extraneous to the genre.\n\nBut these differences between categories of fiction may be less troubling in the children's market than its adult counterpart. As Thomas J. Roberts notes, \"How different, after all, is a wizard with a magic wand from a scientist with a microminiaturized matter-transformer?\" Madeleine L'Engle agrees, asserting that the differences between genres are not always so tangible: \"The lines between science fiction, fantasy, myth, and fairy tale are very fine, and children, like many adults, do not need to have their stories pigeonholed. Science fiction usually takes a contemporary scientific idea and then extrapolates.\" Contemporary science fiction blends many of these story fabrics to create works that are more structurally varied and issue-oriented than their antecedents from the first half of the twentieth century, placing special emphasis on political, social, and environmental themes. In her examination of modern juvenile science fiction, Suzanne Elizabeth Reid states that, \"[t]he field of science fiction is a most appropriate arena for any reader as wise and hopeful as 12-year-olds in their intimation of innocence and their first bloom of knowledge about the world and the people in it, and about its endless speculative possibilities for re-vision.\"\n\nREPRESENTATIVE WORKS\n\nDouglas Adams\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel) 1979\n\nMostly Harmless (novel) 1992\n\nK.

Chicago, Ill.: American Library Association, 1983.\n\n[In the following essay, Esmonde charts the origins of juvenile and young adult science fiction, noting that the \"curiously ambivalent\" genre has \"emerged as a significant subgenre of children's literature.\"]\n\nWith children running around wielding light sabres like Luke Skywalker, or zapping Space Invaders on their Atari Video Consoles, or watching the ubiquitous Star Trek reruns, who could deny that science fiction is an important part of their life.\n\nScience fiction—the literary response to the technological explosion—has become an increasingly significant subgenre of children's literature as well. It is a curiously ambivalent literature. Its supporters look back to such distinguished writers as Thomas More, claiming that his Utopia is science fiction. (Imaginary lands and imaginary lunar voyages were the earliest forerunners of modern science fiction.) Its detractors cite the seemingly endless supply of Grade Z \"monster\" movies, the science fiction pulp magazines, and the old Flash Gordon serials as representative of the genre they unhesitatingly label \"trash.\"\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint the first real science fiction story, but many critics argue for Mary Godwin Shelley's Frankenstein (1817). Although it is basically a Gothic novel, Shelley did introduce as her protagonist a scientist, not a wizard, who revivifies a corpse through \"galvanics\" rather than incantations; she also introduces one of the central themes of science fiction, the proper use of knowledge and the moral responsibility of the scientist for his discovery—a theme often expressed in later \"mad scientist\" movies by the hushed statement at the end of the film: \"There are some things man was not meant to know!\"\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, various authors such as Hawthorne, Melville, and Poe produced stories which could be classified as science fiction according to modern definitions. But it was the work of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells that is considered the most significant predecessor of twentieth-century science fiction. Wells styled these novels \"scientific romances,\" and they are still highly popular with young readers. But Wells and Verne were not alone in producing literature which extrapolated on scientific possibilities. In the children's literature of the same period, authors reflected the increased interest in science. In his essay, \"Juvenile Science Fiction,\" Francis J. Molson notes that as early as 1879, Lu Senarens turned out the first of his 180 Frank Reade, Jr. stories \"which chronicled the adventures of a boy genius responsible for many remarkable inventions.\" Frank Reade, Jr. was followed by other well-known teen protagonists such as Tom Edison, Jr. and Tom Swift, a series inaugurated in 1910 and continued through the 30s….\n\nIn addition to the juvenile series books the children's magazines occasionally offered stories based on the growing interest in science. But these magazines were overshadowed by the emergence of the science fiction pulp magazines in the 1920s. The first magazine devoted solely to stories which its editor, Hugo Gernsbach, labeled \"scientifiction\" initially, later changing the term to \"science fiction,\" was Amazing Stories, which first appeared in 1926. Depending heavily on reprints of authors such as Wells and Verne, the magazine attracted teenage male readers chiefly. (Girls weren't encouraged to be interested in science, and relatively few were attracted by these magazines.) The original material which appeared in Gernsbach's publication was seldom (if ever) of significant literary quality, but the teenage reader could overlook an enormous amount of bad writing if the action or the idea held his interest. There emerged in this first flowering of science fiction two main types of plots: \"space opera,\" the action-adventure oriented story with a strong young hero in conflict with an evil villain. The young hero is usually associated with a good scientist who practically always has a beautiful daughter whose function, in addition to decorating the cover of the magazine in the clutches of a tentacled monster, robot or other unspeakable horror, was to ask questions so that information could be conveyed to the reader, and to be captured (screaming shrilly) so that the hero could act heroically. It is, of course, a plot familiar to children's literature. Substitute a sword for the hero's laser gun, call the scientist a wizard, make his daughter a princess, the despot a sorcerer, the assorted aliens enchanted animals, and the structure is apparent. In Star Wars, George Lucas capitalized on this rich fantasy vein which underlies so much science fiction, even opening the film with the familiar fairy tale beginning: \"Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away.\"\n\nThe second basic plot in this period was nicknamed \"gadget\" science fiction because the chief feature of this type of story was the description of the invention. Again, the scientist (often eccentric but with the mandatory beautiful daughter), aided by the young lab assistant (the galactic hero thinly disguised in a lab coat), is asked by the daughter the all-important question: \"What is that thing you're working on, Father?\" The rest of the story consists of the answer to that question.\n\nThough subliterature, these \"thrilling wonder\" tales exerted considerable influence on young readers, and many of today's leading scientists have credited these magazines with encouraging them to pursue careers in various scientific disciplines.\n\nThe first American juvenile science fiction novel to be admitted to library shelves was Robert A. Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo, published in 1947 by Scribner's. The plot is naive by today's standards: three teenagers and their scientist uncle build a rocketship in the backyard, journey to the moon, disrupt a Nazi plot to conquer the earth, discover a lost lunar civilization, and return home, but Heinlein proceeded to dominate adolescent science fiction, publishing twelve novels between 1947 and 1958. Critic Alexei Panshin is of the opinion that it is by these novels, rather than his adult science fiction, that Heinlein's reputation will be sustained.\n\nAnother significant writer who contributed to the rapidly expanding field of the adolescent science fiction novel was Andre Norton, whose Star Man's Son (1952) introduced the post-catastrophe science fiction story, less \"engineer-oriented\" than Heinlein's work. Isaac Asimov contributed the Lucky Starr series, and many other magazine science fiction writers tried their hand at juvenile science fiction, with varying degrees of success. The Winston Science Fiction Series, begun in 1952, was perhaps the most ambitious attempt to provide adolescent readers with science fiction novels.\n\nIn addition to the Winston Series, there was the predictable assortment of \"tentacled monster\" novels and alien invasion novels; there were any number of space exploration novels in which the young cadet saved the galaxy by courageous and timely action. Even Lassie was translated into science fiction in William Morrison's Mel Oliver and Space Rover on Mars, the saga of a super collie.\n\nAt the same time that science fiction writers were discovering the juvenile market, children's authors who had no connection with the science fiction magazines began to respond to youth's expanding scientific interests. Ellen MacGregor's Miss Pickerell Goes to Mars appeared in 1951. Ruthven Todd introduced Space Cat in 1952, and in 1954, \"middle-aged\" children were delighted to make The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet courtesy of Eleanor Cameron. Wonderful Flight, the first of a series of five imaginative space fantasies, followed in the long tradition of stories written for the author's own child. Written for her son David, Mrs. Cameron's series has proved an enduring favorite….\n\nLike its parent, children's science fiction has diversified considerably since the 1950s. Two science fiction novels—Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time and Robert C. O'Brien's Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH—have won the Newbery Medal. Sylvia L. Engdahl has provided a series of novels, including Enchantress from the Stars and The Far Side of Evil, which feature a resourceful female protagonist.\n\nThroughout the last two decades, science fiction continued to gain acceptance as a legitimate literary genre, suitable for classroom use. In the 1970s, courses in science fiction began to proliferate on college and university campuses, and serious literary criticism appeared….\n\nScience fiction has come a very long way from the days of the boys' series books and the pulp magazines. It has emerged as a significant subgenre of children's literature. Blending the realism of today's technology with the magic of future possibilities, it is particularly suited to fire the youthful imagination \"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\n\nSuzanne Elizabeth Reid (essay date 1998)\n\nSOURCE: Reid, Suzanne Elizabeth. \"New Themes and Trends.\" In Presenting Young Adult Science Fiction, pp. 199-206. New York, N.Y.: Twayne Publishers, 1998.\n\n[In the following essay, Reid examines the evolving nature of juvenile science fiction, drawing particular emphasis to emerging thematic patterns within the genre.]\n\n\"The Golden Age of Science Fiction Is Twelve,\" writes David G. Hartwell, borrowing a phrase from Peter Graham for the title of his essay in Age of Wonders: \"Science fiction is preeminently the literature of the bright child, the kid who is brighter perhaps than her teachers.\"1 He describes how Robert A. Heinlein, in a speech at the Third Annual World Science Fiction Convention in Denver in 1941, claimed superiority for sf readers who think \"in terms of racial magnitude—not even centuries but thousands of years\" (Hartwell, 91).\n\nThe main motivation behind science fiction, and the source of its power and appeal, is escape from the strictures of everyday thinking, allowing the imagination to see beyond what we have been taught is real and possible. The young, and people with youthful, curious minds, are more apt to tolerate this kind of speculation.\n\nPerhaps the dawn of technology and industry spurred the imagination to visualize with scientific imagery in the same way the Renaissance keyed on images of travel and discovery. Science fiction flourished in North America in the early decades of the twentieth century, when science and technology were considered the salvation of humanity from poverty, crime, dirt, and disease. Especially in the 1950s when Sputnik orbited the Earth, and soon afterward when humans landed on the moon, the frontier for human exploration no longer was bound by geography; topology, physics, and astronomy became the central areas of scientific interest. Now, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, are our minds still 12 years old? Is our collective mind still awed by the possibility of scientific research and technological invention?\n\nIn a Piagetian sense, 12-year-olds are just recognizing the difference between literal facts and abstract or metaphorical thought. It is evident in their choice of humor that celebrates puns and other quirks of language. For intelligent readers with young minds, science fiction, drawing heavily on the literal machinery of science and technology to explore the complexity of ideas, is an exciting venue. Their dis-covery of this kind of literature is often the beginning of a long career of reflective thinking and delight in intellectual pursuits. While many adult readers have been traumatized by the escalating, dizzying rate of technological change since World War II into a permanent state of what Alvin Toffler has termed future shock,2 young minds, despite the whirligig of modern time, retain their enthusiasm for the new and different. Many adults have lost their sense of \"Oh, wow!\" about technological progress because they are legitimately tired of being forced to learn new habits, or they have lived long enough to recognize the complex implications of rapid change. Much of the sf written for adults is conservative, reflecting a pessimism about the use of future technology and a yearning for an idealized vision of the rural past.\n\nLiterature for young people, including science fiction written for youth, has traditionally ended hopefully, positing an optimistic belief in new beginnings. Heroes made wise at a young age, such as Douglas Hill's Cord McKiy, Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggin, and Octavia Butler's Lauren Olamina, will avoid the mistakes of their elders and begin a new way of life. Young readers, inspired by their first understandings of the ironical viewpoint, still believe in their own abilities to change the world by proclaiming their newly discovered principles. They are on the cusp of abstract thinking; they believe that their own sense of logic is universal, that all humans are motivated as they are.\n\nScience fiction for 12-year-olds—including the universal 12-year-old in each of us—began with Jules Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth in 1863, which celebrated the possibility of not-yet-invented technology to explore previously unimaginable frontiers. Mary Shelley's work was deeper, probing more into the central dilemmas of science, but was more sophisticated and less hopeful, recognizing the human foibles that could dirty and complicate the clean sweep of progress promised by theoretical science. Although the story of Dr. Frankenstein's monster is beloved by adolescents, hers is an adult novel with levels of complexity young readers may not fully comprehend. In 1910 Victor Appleton wrote the first science fiction novel specifically marketed for children, Tom Swift and His Airship, part of a popular series about a young hero whose virtue and hard work always paid off in success. In the early decades of the century, young readers followed the adventures of comic-strip heroes Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon in the newspapers; read the stories by some of the best writers in the field in the sf magazine Amazing Stories, which began in 1926; and enjoyed the pulp fiction space operas of the middle decades of the twentieth century—all exciting but all merely precursors to the rich harvest yet to come. In the 1960s Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time (1962) was recognized as a classic, an excellent book by any literary standards. Not only science fiction, this work features parents who are scientists and who share their enthusiasm and knowledge with their children. Both the plot and character development center around sophisticated physics, the concept of tessellation. Many readers of children's literature meet science fiction for the first time through this novel.\n\nSince then, sf novels, films, and short stories have joined the mainstream of popular culture as media events worthy of consideration. A growing number of recent writers use science fiction as a pulpit from which to urgently preach their views about ethics, politics, and ecology or to teach a lay audience about physics and space. Science fiction is becoming an acceptable method of teaching, of speculating about the future impact of government policies, our cultural habits of consumption and community, and our attitudes toward the material world.\n\nPart of sf's growing appeal is that modern science is bringing to life the strange ideas and imaginings that once were fiction. So much that seemed wildly fanciful in the past is now possible, though perhaps not probable. Technology has moved the frontiers of exploration from Earth to the moon, Mars, and beyond. The considerable power unleashed by scientific knowledge and its technological instruments is, in science fiction, a source of wishful excitement and vicarious desire, attaining secret insights, skills, machinery, and weaponry that seem to promise instant heroism and the illusion of greatness. To some people, however, science's mastery-urge is a source of profound anxiety, especially its occasional use of cheap thrills to titillate nerves and senses, activating the shallowest impulses of human nature though sometimes playing a part in fiction of a wider scope: \"The last few years have seen the rise of a publishing category known as the techno-thriller, essentially a fast-paced action-suspense genre that exploits our fascination with (and fear of) technology. The overlap between this new genre and science fiction, while perplexing to booksellers, has proved stimulating to many writers\" (Jakubowski, 75). Science fiction has always appealed to both the philosophical mind that wants to speculate about the future in order to plan, and the part of our minds that wants to play with novelty and stimulation. In a world so ruled by science and technology, science fiction is increasingly the most relevant arena for both tendencies.\n\nAnd increasingly, young readers and consumers of science fiction are demanding more-sophisticated media. Virtual-reality devices and computerized games provide constant, instantaneous novelty and stimulus, at a pace and with an immediacy that no book can provide. But they are passive media, requiring a kind of focused awareness different from the thought processes of reading, which translates printed symbols into new images formulated from memory and invented from associations remembered from the past. Reading is an actively creative process; virtual-reality games are reactive. There is room for both kinds of science fiction entertainment, especially among intelligent consumers who delight in the intellectual stimulation of speculative fiction. While films, games, and other technologies astound their viewers with increasingly complex special effects, science fiction readers will still enjoy the printed versions of space adventures. They will also enjoy the increasing use of science fiction for satiric social commentary that ridicules ethnocentric thinking and competitive consumerism. When fictional alien characters from other civilizations react with the logic of the truly naive to some of the self-destructive habits of humans on Earth, intelligent readers can laugh or grimace in agreement. The increasing complexity and intensity of more-serious science fiction demand an equally sophisticated intellectual response, and this challenge is gratifying to readers, both faithful fans of science fiction and the growing number of new readers.\n\nCritic and scholar James Gunn summarizes a current definition of today's science fiction by contrasting it with mainstream fiction's focus on characters' reactions to the repeated patterns of life: \"Science fiction … exists in a world of change and the focus is on external events.\"3 While this may be an accurate differentiation, it is interesting to note recent trends of sf that focus on the effects of future technology on individual lives. New directions for extrapolation seem to be pointing inward.\n\nFor many writers, the new frontiers are mental. \"Mindspeech,\" telepathy, empathy, travel through time and space, even using mental powers to colonize other minds—these are increasingly common themes in the more recent works of Pamela Service, Piers Anthony, Octavia Butler, and Pat Cadigan. The question of how individuals communicate and relate to each other is a central focus, an increasingly relevant issue as Earth's inhabitants outside of fiction interact more frequently and personally.\n\nAs individuals become more aware of each other's motivations and ideas, questions about coping with new people and foreign cultures arise. Traditionally, in our competitive Western culture, the strongest force won the right to make choices for and about the territory and the people in its power. Newer science fiction illustrates a trend toward cooperation as a mode of sharing scarce resources. Douglas Hill's space adventures end with individuals from disparate ethnic backgrounds overcoming their former prejudices and creating new communities. Works by H. M. Hoover and Orson Scott Card tout the necessity for tolerating differences to preserve traditional family values. Now, the message of most speculative media for the young is that war and competitive destruction are too dangerous for humans. Individualism must give way to communities that work together to survive.\n\nWhat motivates individuals to form a community? Many science fiction works paint futures so desolate that individuals are driven to cooperate in order to survive, adapting to conditions that resemble the past before the evolution of sophisticated technology. Others posit communities held together by the power of technology to impose control over the knowledge of a whole society.\n\nA powerful example is Lois Lowry's The Giver (1993). This kind of story frustrates and fascinates readers both young and old who are willing to grapple with the profound questions the author poses so dramatically. The novel takes place in a perfectly controlled community, the kind of place designed by thinkers who have heeded the warnings against over-population with its concomitant hunger, crime, and unemployment. Lowry's world is orderly, calm, and secure, offering comfort to every citizen, insuring a career path carefully selected to fit each individual, a world so logical as to exclude color, caring, and passion—the messiness that distinguishes humans from robots. It is a reasonable world made possible by technology and logic, a rational plan intended to provide the greatest good for the greatest number. It is one of those successful socialist utopias, a world given much lip service by many liberal Democrats who tend to be teachers, librarians, and readers of young adult literature.\n\nTwelve-year-old Jonas is approaching the age when the lifework chosen for him is revealed to him. When he discovers he will be the next Receiver of Memory, he is apprenticed to the Giver, who transmits to him the color, the emotions, the pain, the joy, love, and death—the story of his people, who can remain sane and comfortable because he will bear their suffering. In the process of receiving the truth about his cultural history, Jonas learns the cost of comfort. Over-population is controlled by killing newborns who do not conform to standards of physical or mental health. Crime is controlled by expelling people who threaten social order, or by destroying any impulses that disturb the calm. People and events are perfectly controlled for the good of the average. When Jason rebels, he is forced to submit wholly to the law of this society, or to leave. The open-ended finale hands to the reader the responsibility for deciding the appropriate ending.\n\nLowry's book is emblematic of the best science fiction now being written. Simple answers are no longer acceptable. Wooden characters and boring, predictable plots will not entertain; nowadays there is too much competition for readers' attention to tolerate unskillful writing and sloppy thinking. Recent science fiction writers like Greg Bear, Pat Cadigan, Octavia Butler, Orson Scott Card, and Samuel Delany write complex, thought-provoking, difficult fiction. Others like Douglas Hill, H. M. Hoover, Pamela Sargent, Piers Anthony, William Gibson, and Bruce Sterling dramatically illustrate the problems of current cultural habits. All share a pessimistic fear about the impact of our decisions about science and technology on human society on Earth. But they also share a hope that humans will survive by working together.\n\nThis is an old vision. David Langford, in his \"Twelve Favorite SF Clichés,\" encapsulates a traditional sf ending: \"And I shall call you Eve! says the last man to the last woman after the holocaust, in a favourite version of the 'shaggy God story.'\" God either is revived or is actually an alien or some other surprising twist in the traditional format. At any rate, the human story turns out to be recursive.\n\nMore-recent endings tend to be variations on the threat of radical differences, keying on a survivalist theme: \"Invaders from Space!… an invading fleet battles its way through the planetary defences and despite enormous losses touches down at last on the target area—whereupon great fiery letters appear in the sky, saying GAME OVER—PLEASE INSERT COIN.\"4 Both scenarios offer a hopeful solution to our worst fears, the ultimate end of humanity.\n\nIn her introduction to The Norton Book of Science Fiction (1992), coeditor Ursula K. Le Guin summarizes the categories of literature as delineated by one of sf's most respected scholars, Samuel R. Delany: \"Reporting and history … deal with what happened; realistic fiction, with what could have happened; fantastic fiction, with what could not have happened. And science fiction deals with what has not happened.\"5 At least, not yet. For Delany, science fiction is predictive or extrapolative, describing what might happen. The cautionary tale \"deals with what hasn't happened—yet. And the tale of parallel or alternate worlds deals with what might have happened, but didn't\" (Delany, 27) In a sense, the imaginative, projective, enhanced worlds of science fiction offer a fuller vision of reality than realistic literature, yet a reality whose seductive or terrifying exaggerations remind the reader that it is not yet reality, still only the art of the possible.\n\nFor the young person, full of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas, science fiction continues to offer hopeful wisdom about the reality we are just learning. The field of science fiction is a most appropriate arena for any reader as wise and as hopeful as 12-year-olds in their intimations of innocence and their first bloom of knowledge about the world and the people in it, and about its endless speculative possibilities for revision.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

A Position Piece.\" Lion and the Unicorn 28, no. 2 (April 2004): 284-313.\n\n[In the following essay, Mendlesohn suggests that many contemporary examples of children's science fiction focus more heavily on issues of socialization and family rather than some of the more challenging socio-political themes found in adult science fiction.]\n\nContext\n\nIn 2001 I was a panelist on two different discussions concerning children's science fiction and fantasy, one in the U.S., and one in the U.K. I also sat in the audience at the World Science Fiction Convention in Philadelphia while three publishers discussed the possibility of launching new young adult science fiction lines. A number of issues emerged; we had difficulty recalling many science fiction titles. In the children's and young adult market, fantasy clearly predominated, not merely in the market, but among the accepted genre classics. The two names which occurred most frequently were Robert A. Heinlein and Andre Norton, but no contemporary science fiction writer producing SF for children has achieved the same stature, and no contemporary SF writer who wrote in both the adult and the children's market has been as successful in both. To put this in context, Heinlein and Norton were unusual in their day. Most of their contemporaries who wrote for children have disappeared from the bookshelves, and while we may reminisce, as a consideration of the authors and titles cited by Jessica Yates in her contribution to the International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature (1996) indicates, most (Heinlein, Norton, and Alan E. Nourse may be the exceptions) are not a serious part of the genre canon, in the way in which many of their fantasy counterparts (Lloyd Alexander, Susan Cooper, Alan Garner, for example) are recognized.\n\nOf the titles that were initially suggested as science fiction, too many when scrutinized turned out to be fantasy, or to focus on issues other than science, or social science, or in some other way to somehow not quite feel like science fiction. And there was a clear sense that the younger the child, the more restricted the choice, although fantasy for younger children is very common, and much of it extremely good. One possible reason which was posited were the cognitive requirements of science fiction. Was it possible to tell a tale to a small child which contained the cognitive dissonance—the knowledge that this is a \"what if?\"—which is considered essential to the genre? The idea that there might be a genre that relied for its authority on adulthood is intrinsically alien to the idea that writing for children should be much like writing for adults; that while children may have special interests, they are not fundamentally different in their needs; but the more we considered the ideological and cognitive demands of science fiction, the more we became uncertain as to whether this mode of writing can be adapted wholesale for a younger audience.\n\nThis, it turned out, related to the third issue. Panelists on all three panels had difficulty with the borderland area of young adult science fiction. What marked YA SF before 1970 was the absence of romance. In modern YA marketing, the very presence of romance may define the category. Where SF for adults frequently deploys protagonists without family, and has long been considered the fiction of those who eschew the idea that literature is about inter-personal relationships, modern SF for children and young adults frequently uses the family as either context or motivation. The result was that while the panelists could see the pleasure in the literature for younger children, at the YA level there was unease. The direction of YA SF seemed at variance with the body of the genre. The settings seemed to be deployed to allow the exploration of the individual, rather than of the society. None of which would matter if it were not that most readers come to \"mainstream SF\" in their mid-teens. Why are they reading SF for adults rather than that marketed for their own age group? One possibility is that the young adult SF novel is actually catering to a different need from that satisfied by SF.\n\nThis paper is an attempt to explore some, but not all, of these issues. One aspect to emerge from this paper is the parallel between cognitive development, the structures of children's science fiction, and the structural development of early science fiction, but this must wait for a sequel paper for adequate exploration. Within this paper, I hope to demonstrate that it is possible to generate science fiction for young children, despite the challenges and despite the relative paucity of material currently available. Part of my argument is that this depends less on the images and contextual markers of SF than it does on a way of thinking about the world which requires authors to offer a type of challenge which moves away from an assumption that literature for children should reinforce what they already recognize. Second, that at the intermediate level, children's science fiction seems to be limiting itself in some cases through an insistence on didacticism, in other cases because of a perceived need to reassure children that the universe is stable, safe, and just. In other texts, the issue may lie with non-SF writers assuming that SF is a practical rather than a speculative genre. And third and finally, that science fiction for the young adult is perhaps the most unstable group of the three, as authors attempt to combine the bildungsroman with a realization of one's very small place in a large universe, the outward drive of the romance, the novel of manners.\n\nBecause this paper builds its case from a wide trawl of sources, some word on research methods is advisable. All the books selected were produced post-1970, and where authors have produced a significant body of work, only sample texts are used. The picture books—with one exception—were collected on visits to Borders, Books of Wonder (New York) and Waterstone's, or on the recommendation of the panel \"Catching 'Em Young\" at the 24th International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts, 2003. They are aimed at children of up to, perhaps, eight, but U.K. children are expected to read rather earlier than are U.S. children, which might explain why Company's Coming (Arthur Yorinks [1988]) is rather scarier than a U.K. picture book might be. The chapter books, aimed at elementary to preteen children, were similarly collected, and added to from recommendations made at Readercon 2002, an SF and fantasy convention dedicated entirely to discussing books in a weekend of panels which resemble master classes in their intensity. The young adult books discussed are a reflection of dinner arguments between friends and what we had on our shelves. As a result, there is an inevitable skewing towards what was available in the U.K. before the end of 2003. Where children's books are concerned, until very recently the U.K. shared its market with the Commonwealth (Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, etc.), rather than with the U.S. In part because of the relative brevity of this paper, all of the books discussed in the chapter book and YA category are books that I like and admire. In all categories there are books that reach the level of full SF, but many do not. Not because they are badly written, or lack imagination, but because the expectations and understandings of children's cognitive and emotional development, and the interests of the authors, cut across the needs of science fiction.\n\nWhat Is Science Fiction?\n\nIf I am going to assert that too many of these books are not science fiction, and am going to make this argument to an audience unfamiliar with the genre, it seems sensible to discuss what science fiction is. Science fiction is less a genre than a mode. It is a way of writing about things, events, and people, rather than a description of which things, events, and people should be written about. This way of science fiction is essentially ideological, as it can and has been argued by critics such as Darko Suvin (1979), Robert Scholes (1975), Gary K. Wolfe (2002), and John Clute (1997), and I am able only to skate over the surface of some of the arguments here, but the two most important approaches to SF are the \"grammar\" of science fiction, and the ideological intentions of science fiction.\n\nThe grammar of SF is essentially a structuralist's argument. In The Encyclopedia of Fantasy John Clute argues for the concept of the \"full fantasy,\" defined as a process of identifying WRONGNESS, THINNING, RECOGNITION of the moment of turn (what we might call an epiphany), and the process of HEALING (1098, 942, 804).1 If we borrow the term and the ideas behind it, we can reach for the concept of the \"full SF story.\" The full SF novel might be summarized, to use Clute's style, as DISSONANCE, RUPTURE, RESOLUTION, CONSEQUENCE.\n\nWhat I have termed DISSONANCE is constructed by the novum and the element of cognitive estrangement. The novum is the idea or object that creates the rupture within the world as we understand it. This may be a robot, a new vaccine or disease, or a change in the social structure. The role of the novum is to be \"tackled,\" either defeated or encompassed within the world order. One apparent marker of SF for small children is that it is oriented towards the novum, or its most rudimentary form, the icon (see Jones, \"Icons\").\n\nIn children's SF, the novum's role may have less to do with its own intrinsic qualities than its novelty value. For example, the qualities of a robot are rarely important to the plot. In Babette Cole's The Trouble with Dad (1985), Dad's robots are the cause of much hilarity and chaos, but they could be out-of-control pets. There is nothing about their robot nature that drives the narrative. Similarly, Ricky Ricotta's robot in Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot vs. The Mecha Monkeys from Mars (Pilkey 2002), could be any large, clumsy best friend. In neither case is the robotness of the robot significant. Although there is DISSO-NANCE, that dissonance does not actually lead to RUPTURE of the expectations of the world or its narrative.\n\nWhat I have here termed RUPTURE, in order to mimic Clute's grammar, is more commonly known as cognitive estrangement. Cognitive estrangement is intrinsic to science fiction, but it is generated not simply by the presence of the dissonant, but by the cohesion of the dissonant world, and the relationship of the protagonists or point of view characters to that dissonance.\n\nEarly science fiction frequently posited only one point of dissonance—the appearance of a miraculous invention or an invader, or one thing changed in the world that is recognizably ours. Children's SF (less so young adults') repeats this early pattern. Sylvia Waugh's Space Race (2000), Lesley Howarth's Map-Head (1994) and Nicholas Fisk's Trillions (1971) are all our world in which aliens arrive. The cognitive dissonance is minimized, and minimized further because in most of these books (MapHead is the exception) we begin from a point of more or less normality and the dissonance is introduced to us: the SF is reduced to its base level of the meeting of the unknown. The rupture is minimized.\n\nBut where a world is made fully dissonant, that is, it is not our world and we must begin to know it, science fiction has developed ways to exaggerate rather than minimize the cognitive dissonance. Specifically, SF has developed what Clute has termed the competent character: the point of view character who understands his or her own world and feels no need to explain its strangenesses to us. Children's and young adult SF has often been weak in this. John Christopher in The Lotus Caves (1969) evades the issue by taking his protagonists out of the space habitat with which they, but not we, are familiar, and sending them on a journey into an unknown world. Sylvia Engdahl in Heritage of the Star (1973) does something very similar, as does Neil Arkasy in Playing on the Edge (2000) and Rodman Philbrick in The Last Book in the Universe (2000). Each chooses to minimize cognitive estrangement by sending the protagonist away from what s/he knows and creating a level playing field between author and character. There is plenty of science fiction for adults that does the same, but it is usually mitigated by much fuller world building, which allows the characters to take the dissonance of their point of origin with them. None of these books really achieves this, although the ignorance of Engdahl's hero may be argued as a substitute.\n\nThere are books which achieve this full estrangement: Nicholas Fisk's A Rag, a Bone, and a Hank of Hair (1980) is one of the best: no explanation is ever provided for much of what we see, and Brin, rather than acting as guide, takes us through his own familiarity with the city. Diana Wynne Jones's A Tale of Time City (1987), which I have not discussed in full because I am not sure if it is SF or fantasy, uses the trick of seeing her city through the eyes of native children who are very bad guides, because their own interests are very different. Philip Reeve's Mortal Engines (2001) sometimes manages this full estrangement, but often opts for a guided tour through a section of his city. In the end, to achieve this full rupture or cognitive dissonance, the author must be willing to demand that the reader identify with a complete other reality in which nothing is questioned or explained. David Lewis argues that \"absorption into the fiction world would be impossible without the reader's knowledge of the rule and code and convention that go into the construction of different kinds of texts\" (135). Yet despite the ubiquity of this in fairy tale, many modern SF children's authors seem to balk, accepting Lewis's superficial statement, while apparently rejecting its implicit insight that all texts are constructed and must be decoded by the reader.\n\nIt is hard to be sure why, but one possibility is that the assumption that books for children be educative is confused with the concept that books for children should be challenging. Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the first SF magazine, Amazing Stories (1926), himself conflated these two: his understanding of science fiction was that it should teach children real scientific knowledge, and we can see this reflected in the contemporary didacticism of J. C. Greenburg's Andrew Lost books and William Sleator's Strange Attractors (1990). This understanding of SF cannot risk that anything be left uncomprehended. What this leads to is the refusal of SF as a literature of extrapolation and reason, an element of SF which I will discuss further when we consider SF's ideological structures.\n\nAfter DISSOLUTION and RUPTURE we have RESOLUTION. This is perhaps the least contentious element of the grammar I have outlined. All fiction requires some form of resolution, but in a point to which I will return, it should be borne in mind that the resolutions in science fiction may well not be personal, but leave an individual stranded in a resolved future that does not suit him or her. But more important, in the \"full SF story,\" the resolution is not the end of the story, it is the beginning, for SF resolutions are about change and consequence. Not infrequently, the resolution of a problem is merely the beginning of an SF story. Fred Pohl's \"The Midas Plague\" (1954) begins in a world which has solved all of its energy problems. But far from a utopia, this is a world in which the poor are forced to consume, and the rich flaunt their wealth through ostentatious austerity. The \"story\" is merely beginning.\n\nWithout CONSEQUENCE any SF tale is incomplete. It is crucial to the SF universe that consequences be more than individual wish fulfilment: this is not fairy tale, in which the invention/magic trick can raise the pauper to prince without some kind of change in the social structure. Consequence in science fiction is the rippling out of effect, the quantum butterfly that flaps its wings and triggers economic panic on the far side of the world. Heinlein was the first formally to identify this, and its significance for science fiction, and it was also Heinlein, one of the most important author-critics in the field,2 who defined adulthood as the age at which one was able to do Higher Math. The two are not unrelated: children's grasp of consequence evolves relatively slowly, not helped by adults' often inconsistent application of the idea (Byrnes 173). We can see this cognitive marker reflected in a subgenre of the YA publication market, the game books of the 1980s, in which children chose the routes they would take through the books. Children become interested in this kind of gaming around the age of ten and are absorbed into it around the early teens, the same age at which most SF fans report their first meaningful encounter with science fiction. Identification of novum and cognitive dissonance usually leads to the idea of causality and consequence. That \"what if\" needs to be followed by the concept of \"if, then.\" In many of the novels aimed at children and young adults which I will discuss, maturity (the growth into adulthood) substitutes for political and social consequences. In Fisk's Trillions (1971), Monica Hughes's The Keeper of the Isis Light (1980), and Dan Gutman's Virtually Perfect (1999) there are no consequences: the experiment is ended, its manifestations destroyed, and the world restored to the status quo.\n\nThis may be disguised by a promise of future change, such as in Sylvia Engdahl's Heritage of the Star (1973), but more often, this circularity—this rejection of consequences and of the future—is one of the structural markers which separate young adult from adult science fiction, yet it is by no means a necessity. Robert Heinlein's juveniles (as they were then called) are almost all open ended; the resolution of the immediate problem opens out challenges for the future. The hero of Tunnel in the Sky (1955) becomes a pioneer, that of Between Planets (1951) is left engaged in an interplanetary war but with his future significance reduced. In Space Cadet (1948) one achievement simply points the way to new challenges. Similarly, Troy in Andre Norton's Catseye (1961) is denied the possibility of return—he is a refugee—and all his problems are externalized in a changing world in which there cannot be any endpoint, and the stasis of the prevailing social structure is not consolatory, but life threatening. Of more recent novels, only Jan Mark's The Ennead (1978) comes close to this situation, but even here Isaac, the protagonist, ends the book with his place in the family assured. Troy is assured only of consequence.\n\nScience fiction is a fiction of rules, and many of these rules are ideological. Any science fiction tale is expected to be internally consistent; things cannot happen simply because someone or something has special powers (even extrasensory perception stories tend to impose limits on their heroes). SF is a fiction of speculation. At its most basic it asks, \"If we do this, what will happen/what will we find?\" As it becomes more sophisticated, it adds to that basic question others: \"How will we react?\" \"What will be the consequences of that reaction?\" Early science fiction began with those first questions, branching out to consider an ever larger matrix of effect, so it is not unreasonable that science fiction aimed at the youngest readers begins where the genre began.\n\nThe drive of SF has been, historically, outwards, with a reverse mirror image that says, \"If something happens in the macro-world, how will it affect my own life?\" But crucial to all of these constructions is that science fiction is about permanent change. Once Pandora's box is opened, modern SF (unlike many of the invention stories of the 1930s) does not accept that change can be undone, or the universe returned to its starting place, but it does insist that we can shape that change, that we are in control, even if only barely. Successful SF may console, but it is rarely consolatory (see Mendlesohn). This does not mean that there cannot be a happy ending, but a successful SF ending usually posits a future: the \"we all die\" of Robert Swindells's Brother in the Land (1984) is in these terms consolatory because it denies human con-trol over the future—if we can't change anything, why try? This gets to the heart of some classical ideas of what adolescence is for and what adulthood is supposed to be. J. Piaget (as quoted by David Wood) accused the adolescent of \"egocentricity … as though the world would submit itself to idealistic schemes rather than to systems of reality.\" Wood tries to ameliorate this: \"The Task of the adolescent is to recognise that a view of the world that might be true 'ideally' may turn out, on further reflection, observation and experiment, to be unrealistic and unworkable. To give up idealism\" (Wood 191). But SF writers and readers would, I think, tend to recognize themselves in Piaget's and Wood's descriptions and take pleasure in them. Postnuclear fiction for adults is usually about the reconstruction of the world, the refusal of \"unworkability.\"\n\nOne way to consider science fiction is as an argument with the universe. John Clute would say that it is itself arguable; effective science fiction can be disputed. This distinguishes it from fantasy, which is a literature that regards the universe as having a proper moral order. The purpose of fantasy is often to make moral judgments. The drive of science fiction is to explain order, to test and to engage with it. (Gary K. Wolfe describes fantasy as the fiction of desire, while SF is the fiction of reason [16]). Tom Godwin's \"The Cold Equations\" (1954) is the exemplar of this structure. A young woman sneaks on board a space ship to visit her brother on another planet. The ship is taking a vaccine to the planet and has only enough fuel for the precalculated weight. If the woman stays, the ship crashes. At the end the young woman chooses to step into space. Apart from the ruthless justice which is imposed, note that the \"relationship\" which is at stake is at all times scientific. Her emotional relationships with her brother and with the pilot are irrelevant. While \"The Cold Equations\" is an extreme version of SF ideology, usually known as \"hard SF,\" and many SF writers cheat (or the \"laws\" at stake are political or economic theories), Godwin's understanding of where the issues lie (with the physics rather than with people) is the romantic heart of SF.\n\nThe refusal of an extrapolative structure may limit the extent to which the character can be competent in her universe. In H. M. Hoover's The Lost Star (1980), although Lian Webster is an astrophysicist, she is shown only as an archaeologist, a science that at least in 1980 was susceptible to clear description to the young. She is never shown working in a field that might involve communicating ideas that the readership might not comprehend. There may be other examples that I could compare to this, either supporting or not supporting my point, but I found only one, Sleator's Strange Attractors, which plays with the idea of destabilized time and a fractured, chaotic universe. Sleator expects readers to come to terms with chaos theory in comprehending what is going on, but the solution to the protagonists' problems turns out to lie with a straightforward piece of time travel and mechanical destructiveness; chaos theory does not hold the key to the solution. Generally speaking, these novels do not stretch the conceptual or scientific imaginations of their readers because they pitch themselves at what readers may be expected to understand already. This is fundamentally at variance with the declared ideology of science fiction and is one of the clear dividing lines between SF for adults and SF written for the young (even though no SF critic would argue that all adult SF novels fulfill their remit). It may help explain, however, why young people interested in SF rapidly move over to the adult market, seeking material in which the science and the technology do matter.\n\nDespite the influence of hard SF, the genre does have room for the personal, but it is usually in engagement with something much larger. One obvious example of this might be how family life would be different if children were multiply parented. An SF novel might choose to focus on the child, but it might alternatively consider the consequence for society. An example of the former is Eleanor Arnason's recent \"Knapsack Poems\" (2002), of the latter Samuel R. Delany's Triton (1976). However, when the novel comes to privilege the personal over the political, scientific or social, to see the science fictional plot as an external space in which to work out strategies to apply to one's beginning point (usually home life), rather than to lead one out into the universe, it frequently loses those qualities that are associated with SF. The SF adventure becomes metaphor; it does not matter in and of itself, but is subordinate to the bildungsroman of family or school crisis. The effect is to diminish the sense of wonder intrinsic to SF, and at its worst, as in Lesley Howarth's Mister Spaceman (2000) or Jeanne Willis's Rocket Science (2002), in which the SF turns out to be the internal monologue of unhappy children, it simply cheats.\n\nWhen reading the first draft of this paper, Michael Levy argued that everything I have outlined above was an imposition,\n\n… a tendency to privilege what you call \"full science fiction\" over coming-of-age stories … for adults the SF story that actively engages with the society or science and its problems is more interesting, but the novel in which a child or young adult simply finds his place in society is a standard form of YA fiction … the writer who does this kind of book is not so much failing to write a better kind of book as s/he is simply working within standard YA genre conventions. You can criticize books for not doing more, but should you more clearly acknowledge the fact that the writer wasn't trying to do what you'd prefer him/ her to be doing?\n\n(E-mail, 10/22/02)\n\nLevy's points are sensible. I am, in Lesnik-Oberstein's terms, attempting to discern and define the quality of a book in terms of those values which I believe children should assimilate from a particular genre (39), or, as John Stephens would argue, imposing a top-down reading which draws on a set of codes established by adult readers (30). But then it is a commonplace that fiction written for children is the ultimate \"outsider\" text, one which is written by and with different intentions and desires from those embraced by the reader community. Books for children are not (generally) written by children. \"The distinctive feature is that all such artwork is in part a one way traffic (Hollindale 27). Given this, the implied community for a children's SF book might be those who are directing the reading of children towards securing a readership for adult science fiction. If the \"hidden curriculum\" of children's books is to keep children reading, then it seems not unreasonable for a reader or critic of adult SF to argue that the best science fiction for children is that which has, as its hidden curriculum, the desire to persuade children to move into the adult genre (Clerland 118).\n\nThe failure to privilege the universe does not necessarily make the book a bad book, but it does make one suspect that the book is less likely to appeal to those who are already reading in the genre or who are likely to be attracted to adult SF. These books can then be tested against what Raymond Williams argues is an idea of quality through \"tradition,\" a way of judging books by the extent to which they promote the values of the communities in which they are marketed (Wood 122). If we accept SF as a community (and the very large number of science fiction conventions at which books are bought and discussed supports this contention), then it is valid to consider these texts in terms of whether they support the beliefs and ideological structures of the genre—and this is why John Rowe Townsend was wrong to argue that genre-critics are ignorant when they enter the field of children's literature (92). So that while Levy may well be correct that what I am engaged in is an exercise in prejudice, his own rebuttal, which argues for a different genre category, confirms rather than denies the thesis. If the writer is trying to \"do something else,\" then it is a reasonable project to say so. This is reinforced by a recognition that the problem is not unique to YA SF. Gary K. Wolfe argues that this problem infects the SF/thriller crossover in which \"the very intellectual challenges that traditionally define an effective technological science fiction story seem to mitigate against the largely anti-intellectual (or at least anti-scientist), technologically ambivalent tone of the paranoid thriller\" (18). Differing ideologies of power, Wolfe contends, makes it hard for an SF writer to produce effective thrillers, or vice versa.\n\nAn extreme example of the problem of competing ideologies is found in slash fiction. Slash is fan fiction which describes a physical relationship, usually homosexual, between two characters in a television show (film and book are less common, but there is plenty of Harry Potter/Snape slash on the Internet). The best known is Kirk/Spock fiction. The trappings of these stories are inevitably SF because Star Trek is science fiction, but the purpose of the stories is very different. The sole purpose of Kirk/Spock stories is to maneuver the two characters into a clinch. Science, aliens, a world war, may well be the tools deployed to achieve this, but we all know where we are going to end up, and it is not arguing the mysteries of the universe.\n\nArguing with the Universe: \"If We Do This, What Will Happen, What Will We Find?\"\n\nThe most basic children's SF barely even asks this most crucial question. Some of it is science fiction only by courtesy. Aliens and robots are reduced to the level of icon and take the place of fairies, elves and monsters (see Nick Butterworth's Q Pootle 5 [2000], Dan Yaccarino's wish-fulfillment fantasy, If I Had a Robot [1996], and Babette Cole's The Trouble with Dad [1985]), and pretty much anything can happen.\n\nBut if we discount these \"courtesy\" titles, while recognizing that they are often rather wonderful fantasies, and concentrate on those which are clearly intended to function in some way as SF, in that they have rules and a sense that the world is consistent, plenty remain to be tested against the structural demands of science fiction.\n\nOne of the commonest types of SF picture books on the shelf is what we might call the analogic book, those picture books that transfer recognizable situa-tions directly to a science fictional stage set. These books attempt through mimesis and analogy to use SF to comfort children. Unsurprisingly, the schoolroom is a favored setting.\n\nShana Corey and Mark Teague's First Graders from Mars: Episode 1, Horus's Horrible Day (2001) and Dan Yaccarino's Blast Off Boy and Blorrp: First Day on a Strange New Planet (2000), ostensibly look out wards, in that they narrate a child's experience of leaving the home, the archetype for the planetary exploration story. But the purpose of these books is to make familiar, not to make marvelous. The \"playground\" they present to children is just that: the alien in First Graders from Mars starts his first day at \"Martiangarten\" and discovers there are no \"slime tables,\" no \"snooze mat,\" and no snacks. Blast Off Boy goes to his alien exchange school in a yellow space bus. For all their nonmimetic setting, these are essentially mimetic books. First Graders from Mars falls into the trap, either to reassure or from simple laziness, of clothing its aliens in recognizable analogues of human clothing (females wear skirts). Blast Off Boy discovers that the zipper on his space suit is down but the issue is embarrassment, not sudden death. The only real dissonance provided is with the food, which in both cases fights back, a favorite childhood fantasy.\n\nThe apparently more imaginative and challenging Nova's Ark by David Kirk (1999) also fails to jump this very first hurdle. The artwork is slick: the spaceships on the inside cover are a delight, and the vivid artwork inside makes an immediate impact, but this is science fiction as image (the very definition of \"science fictional\"). The \"what if\" of the book might have been about what a planet peopled by robots looks like, but Nova, the hero, is a boy. He is not a newly-built robot who has yet to learn his capabilities: he is a robot, sized to be a boy and with the large eyes we associate with children. His mother cooks oil broth. He is told that he will grow up, and the robots around him are carefully divided by sex (skirts, \"hair\"). This is not a criticism of sexism, but lack of imagination. Why nuclear families? Why gender divides? The inability to imagine consequence renders the universe untouchable: nothing that is done can change the fundamentals of the world.\n\nNova's Ark might have become SF in its plot, but while Kirk asks a question of the universe, about energy and what it can do, he chooses not to answer it. When Nova inadvertently goes exploring and discovers both his father and the crystals which will provide his world with the power it needs, this might have been the springboard for thoughts about the future. But this book is actually about father-son relationships: the change that takes place is personal (Taspett declares he will stop exploring and take his family with him when he travels). The much bigger consequence, that the planet Roton now has all the power it needs, is ignored. The book is essentially circular. It begins with the disruption of family and ends with the reconstruction of family; all else is embroidery. This circularity has been identified by Nikolajeva as one of the fundamental markers of children's fiction. But while Nova has a future with his family, the history of his planet has ended.\n\nContrast this with Kevin Boos's and Bill Clemente's Visitor Parking (2002). This is a very simple Thanksgiving tale. A class of schoolchildren are visited by aliens who work out where to park by the sign \"Visitor Parking\" and turn out to have come to admire the curly red hair of the schoolteacher, which they too share. They are sent home with pumpkin pie and candy corn, reinforcing the Thanksgiving message of sharing. There is plenty of mimesis and relevance here, but the aliens remain mysterious throughout and we are left with questions: Where were they from? Where are they going to? What kind of people travel so far for such a reason? People like us maybe, tourists.\n\nCompany's Coming, by Arthur Yorinks, has a very similar story to tell, but does so in a more complex fashion. And it asks the deceptively innocuous question, \"How shall we welcome the stranger?\" Shirley and Moe, a small-town American couple, have invited relatives for dinner. As Moe is tinkering in the yard, a barbecue-shaped spaceship lands, decanting two very small and rather frightened-looking aliens. They declare they come in peace and then ask to use the bathroom. Shirley asks them for dinner, and they depart to return at 6:00. Moe, unknown to Shirley, calls the FBI. By 5:45 the house is surrounded by the army. The aliens arrive, disconcert the terrified relatives by saying they are looking for a planet as theirs is overcrowded, and trigger the entry of the soldiers when they present Shirley with a package. It turns out to be a blender.\n\nTwo things make this deceptively simple book stand out. First is the language. In this book the word \"alien\" is never used. The spacemen are \"visitors,\" \"foreigners,\" \"strangers,\" or simply \"the men.\" In other words, they are people, and this book is fundamentally about people and how we all act together. Secondly, the artwork. I've said little about the artwork up to now, because until these three books, the artwork has often seemed peripheral, but here David Small's illustrations are crucial to the dissonance that drives the story. The aliens are tiny, but what Moe sees is their helmets and guns. Moe and Shirley are incredibly ordinary and made to look more vulnerable in their glasses, and the vulnerability of the aliens is emphasized by their big eyes and fragile extremities. Domesticity is emphasized by the juxtaposition of weapons of war against a tiny suburban home. When the house is surrounded we see it as if we are perched on one of the tanks outside; we loom over the house and watch the helicopters gather. As we enter the house with the visitors we are the hint of guns in the darkness, and we know it is us that the guests are frightened of. When the guns burst in, they do so over the laid table, destroying the domesticity that the blender will restore. At the end of this book, \"we\" are those of us who welcome strangers. Shirley invites the army to dinner, and we have moved on from our initial state of suspicion. The story hints at a new future.\n\nThe ideological direction of science fiction is fundamentally the drive to ask questions. It is rarely put this way, but while mimetic fiction is often in the business of supplying answers to the questions we all hold in common (\"the meaning of life\" being the most obvious) science fiction is the small child saying \"Mu … um …?\" while working out which \"why\" to ask next.3Maybe One Day, by Frances Thomas and Ross Collins (2001), makes this SF bildungsroman \"storyable.\" On the surface this is a little boy's imaginary journey through fantastical space; the fact that the little boy is a monster gives it a science fictional appearance but does not make it SF. But Little Monster is engaged in narrating the universe, asking questions of it and working out his own answers in the face of his father's (fantasy) distractions. The tale begins with Little Monster declaring that he has a problem: he wants to be an explorer and this will mean leaving his parents behind. \"'Maybe we could come with you,'\" his father says (2). \"'Don't be silly,' said Little Monster, 'Explorers don't take their mummies and daddies'\" (3). This sets the tone. Daddy will propose something preposterous and Little Monster will correct him. Little Monster explains that on the moon one can jump as high as a house. Daddy says, \"'You might bounce all the way back into space'\" (6), but Little Monster says that can't be done. When Daddy warns him about Martians, Little Monster denies their existence. Daddy warns him not to slide off the rings of Saturn, but Little Monster focuses on the dangers of the meteorites. As Katherine Nelson has observed, young children frequently recast the story \"told\" into something they prefer (207-09), but here the power is handed over to the child. It is Daddy who tries to retell the \"story of the universe\" at variance with the evidence.\n\nThroughout, Daddy keeps trying to impose a fantasy narrative onto the adventure, while Little Monster is resolutely in favor of science fiction, and of experimentation, as demonstrated in the illustrations. Jeanne Willis's Dr. Xarggle's Book of Earthlets (2002), illustrated by Tony Ross, functions in a not dissimilar way. The alien Dr. Xarggle is instructing his young charges before they begin a visit to Earth. Most of the book is dedicated to describing human babies,4 and the misinterpretations are glorious. \"'To stop them leaking, Earthlets must be pulled up by the back tentacles and folded in half. Then they must be wrapped quickly in a fluffy triangle or sealed with paper and glue.'\" The accompanying picture shows a very disconcerted child covered in brown paper and tape. \"'After soaking, Earthlets must be dried carefully to stop them shrinking. Then they are sprinkled with dust to stop them sticking to things,'\" accompanied by a picture of a child apparently drowning in talcum powder. But Dr. Xarggle absolutely relies on dissonance and cognitive estrangement. The book is hilarious to adults because it relies on sarcasm. Recent research, however, suggests that children \"could start to understand the concept of sarcasm by the age of five, but did not start laughing until they reach the age of ten\" (\"Findings\" 6). So how and why might children find this book funny?\n\nDr. Xarggle requires children to engage with what they know, and with what they don't know, to reconcile the two. In order for this book to work a child must be aware of what is actually happening in the pictures, how it would be described, the literal meaning of Dr. Xarggle's description, and the concept of metaphor. It works because of what it asks children to do: to adopt the classic SF reading strategy which relies on the literal truth of metaphor. Dr. Xarggle relies on the classic Wimmer and Permer test of 1983:\n\nThe child watches a boy (Maxi) place chocolate in a cupboard, then leave the room. Someone moves the chocolate.\n\nThe child observer is asked to guess where Maxi will look for the chocolate first.\n\n3 year olds predict Maxi will look where the chocolate has now been placed.\n\n4 years olds predict that Maxi will look where he himself put the chocolate.\n\n(Nelson 255)\n\nDr. Xarggle absolutely relies on the boundary between the age groups. One might expect a four-year-old to laugh at the three-year-old comprehension displayed by Dr. Xarggle. It, and to a lesser extent Maybe One Day, represent an important leap forward in what is expected of the child reader. The world of the imagination and the world out there are to be challenged and defined, made knowable, subject to understanding through evidence and experiment, one of the central conceits of SF. This central conceit is at the heart of David Weisner's June 29, 1999 (1992), a picture book aimed at a rather older age group, perhaps contemporaneous with the audience for chapter books. The book is entirely focused around two questions: What will happen if we grow vegetables in the atmosphere, and where do all the large vegetables come from? In addition, there is a \"hidden\" question … What is the relationship between the two?\n\nWhat is interesting is that only June 29, 1999 and Maybe One Day directly tackle the notion of the sublime in science fiction, that sense of wonder that I suggested was at the heart of the original SF tale. Dr. Xarggle demonstrates some of it, but generally, this is an element that seems to accompany the \"fullest\" of the picture books, rather than to operate as a starting point for the least science fictional examples. However, when we consider children's chapter books there is no automatic \"advance\" in the understanding of science fiction. If anything, some of the books I considered are less challenging than were the picture books if we hold them to the requirement that they argue with the universe.\n\nChildren's chapter books are an uneasy category to begin with because they need to cover both children who are reading on their own, and those children and parents who continue to prefer communal reading. The range of reading abilities is huge; children are not yet fully divided into those who read because they love it, and those who read because they are told they should. Of the former category, many overleap this stage anyway, going straight for books intended for older readers, irrespective of whether they have the vocabulary or understanding to deal with the content fully. The impact on the books themselves is hard to pin down, but there is a difference of feel between those books with big words, and pictures on the pages, and those which are quite clearly novels for younger readers. Some of the books here seem designed to encourage readers, rather than to be written for the joy of telling stories. This does not mean that the books are bad, simply that they have a rather different agenda. Most obviously in this category is the Andrew Lost series, beginning with Andrew Lost, #1: On the Dog (2002) by J. C. Greenburg, a science writer.\n\nAndrew Lost could be compared to Weisner's June 29, 1999 in that the series is about scientific experiment. Produced as graded readers for Random House (and so quite clearly books intended to encourage the act of reading), the Andrew Lost volumes are science rather than SF books. But this renders them more problematic, for unlike the girl in June 29, 1999 Andrew is not encouraged to think or to experiment or to engage in the Socratic dialogue characterized by Maybe One Day, but is instead catechized. All Andrew's questions are answered by his robot, Thudd, a process which reduces strangeness and turns the child inward towards \"home\" and information, rather than outwards, towards discovery.\n\nThe Outward Drive of Science Fiction; or, [not] Getting Away from the Family\n\nChildren's picture books and science fiction have at their heart something in common; they aim to encourage the reader to explore the universe. Not all of the picture books do this successfully, but if anything, those which see themselves as teaching tools are even more oriented towards teaching the child to look outwards, beyond themselves to the school, perhaps. It is rather interesting, therefore, that the chapter books seem to have a rather different velocity. Nikolajeva has observed that much of children's fiction is recursive; it directs children back to stability and to comfort. To my surprise, it was these chapter books, aimed at the middle age group (perhaps eight to thirteen years), which most fulfilled Nikolajeva's structural outline. Levy would, I think, argue I am imposing an external agenda on these books, but in their titles and packaging these texts are marketed as SF, and are therefore presumably aimed toward a proto-science fiction fan, given that this is an age group that may be presumed to be choosing its own books to a greater or lesser extent. It consequently becomes a matter of some concern if titles aimed at that proto-SF reader directly deny, in a variety of ways, the structures and ideological drives which attracted the reader in the first place.\n\nAt the extreme are what I have come to term the metaphorized fantasies. These are books which superficially look and feel like SF or fantasy but re-solve themselves as metaphorical narrations of personal and interpersonal crisis. Two recent examples are Jeanne Willis's Rocket Science (2002) and Lesley Howarth's Mr. Spaceman. In the first, a boy, isolated from his family, finds an alien, fixes his rocket, and helps him back to space. In the second, Thomas Moon receives letters from an astronaut. Rocket Science is resolved when the alien turns out to be a handicapped Albanian refugee. Thomas Moon in Mr. Spaceman turns out to have been writing the letters to himself. Both boys reach resolution when their family troubles are resolved and when they turn away from science. Both of these books direct the gaze away from the universe. In what I know to be a very personal reaction, I felt betrayed by their endings, not merely because the SF storyline turned out to be false, but because the message appeared to equate maturity with the abandonment of ambition.\n\nAmbition can be limited, and the recursive pattern reinforced in other ways. Dav Pilkey's Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot series is a version of Edward F. Ellis's The Steam Man of the Prairies (1868). Ricky Ricotta is an anthropomorphized mouse. In Ricky Ricotta's Mighty Robot vs. The Mecha Monkeys from Mars, the robot rescues Mousekind from the title villains. However, the framing narrative, the rupture at the heart of this book, is not the invasion of the monkeys but the destruction of the Ricottas' minivan by the robot. The close of the story sees Ricky and his robot rewarded with a brand new minivan. Although the crisis was global, any real consequences in this book are reserved to the home. The domesticization of the drama is privileged over the effect of events in the wider world, a convention we associate with the classic novel, not with SF.\n\nThis domesticization of rupture is the focal point for many of the books in this category, and in some cases is the point. Sylvia Waugh's Space Race tells of a small child growing up in a rather isolated village with his father and a housekeeper. Thomas knows he is an alien, but the meaning of this is less than clear until the day his father tells him that they are to leave. The novel is a fascinating exploration of the nature of our society, dependent on rules and regulations and knowing who everyone is. But above all it is the story of a child working out where he feels he belongs; it is about the nature of family as distinct from friends, and this is made clear by their disappearance not just from the story but from the world. There are no consequences beyond their own village. All of these points describe Daniel Pinkwater's Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy from Mars (1979). This is essentially a more adult (and better written) version of those school playground stories we saw in the picture books. The science fiction narrative functions to provide a context for a story about bullying and fitting in; it is not in itself the focus of the story.\n\nThe two most effective, and most science fictional, of the \"domestic\" books are Lesley Howarth's MapHead and Margaret Peterson Haddix's Among the Hidden (1998). Among the Hidden tells of Luke, hidden from the world because he is a third child in a world with strict population control. We see very little of the outside world, and the issue of population control is transmuted into a very domestic scenario in which the issues are boredom, and love in the face of fear. The domestic is used to create the sense of an alien environment: information is leaked, rather than fed to the reader. Luke learns about his world through the changes he experiences; the encroachments on his family's farm precipitate his confinement to the house and bring home to him the nature of the government. His discovery of another child, Jen, alters his perspective on the scenario as a whole. With this device Haddix does force the reader outwards, and Among the Hidden concludes with an opening out, as Luke leaves his family for a school that he will enter under a false name—but nothing in the world is changed. In part this is crucial to the structure of the novel, which is about totalitarianism, and its position as the first in a trilogy; but like Space Race and MapHead it leaves the power in the hands of the adults. The lesson Luke learns is that his freedom is in the hands of others, and the temporary solution he is offered involves the recreation of family structures.\n\nHaddix's message is repeated in Bruce Coville's My Teacher Flunked the Planet (1992), sold as a novel, but packaged more like a graded reader. Aliens are around to protect humans from themselves and to teach them what they really are. The novel matches almost perfectly to Heinlein's Have Space Suit—Will Travel (1958). Both conclude with a court case in which Earth must be defended by children, but in Coville's version, the children are told what is special about them by their guardian alien. In contrast, Heinlein's children must work out their own defense. In Nancy Farmer's The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm (1994) (the only book in this entire article with nonwhite protagonists), the children, although independent and skilled, must eventually be rescued by adults.5 Although Farmer's 2002 novel The House of the Scorpion has a more solitary hero, he too finally relies on adults who are able to make things right.\n\n[Image Not Available]\n\nAnd in each case the most immediate effect is to resolve familial tensions. The world may be saved, but the most important issue is whether one is talking to one's father. In contrast, Heinlein's heroes find themselves looking down on their parents from the new perspective of adulthood (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers) or at least as equals (Space Suit). His heroes look out and away.\n\nLesley Howarth's MapHead is funny and memorable. The driver of the plot is, again, intensely domestic: Powers and MapHead are on Earth to find MapHead's mother, and the dissonance is introduced because MapHead is a stranger on Earth yet is the narrator of the novel. We see Earth through his eyes, and as with Dr. Xarggle, we discover that our habits are not as immediately comprehensible as we might assume. MapHead's noncomprehension can lead to disturbing moments: the book opens with the reduction of a cat to milkshake and the calm consumption of said milkshake by Powers and MapHead as they sit in the greenhouse. Yet despite this MapHead is a competent protagonist. Within the world of the green-house he understands the power wielded by his father, and the code of behavior to which he is expected to adhere—although he challenges it when Powers threatens to make the kitten into another milkshake. And later, when MapHead does find his mother, it is he who controls the adventure, and later erases the memories of those with whom he has been in contact. But this last action is problematic, for it reduces sections of the novel to a dream sequence in which MapHead reconstitutes and then rejects his nuclear family and returns to the \"home\" represented by his traveling father. This is the Disney version of The Wizard of Oz, in which one's own home and family are always the most attractive. The disruption that MapHead causes is localized and contained within the domestic. And as we shall see in the young adult books, it introduces us to a pattern in which the maturity of the young protagonist becomes a plot substitute for wider cha"
