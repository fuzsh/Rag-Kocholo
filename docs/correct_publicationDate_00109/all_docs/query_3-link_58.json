        "text": "David Weber is renowned for writing immersive, intricate military sci-fi, such as his epic Honor Harrington series, which follows the exploits of a female member of the space navy.\n\nWeber's Safehold series is another beloved sci-fi military saga. The majority of the series takes place in the 31st century, on a planet called Safehold, where humans have created a pre-industrial society to avoid being detected by the Gbaba, a mysterious enemy responsible for destroying human civilization elsewhere. The series explores themes of industrialization and religion, and is a sweeping portrait of how an isolated society might adapt and react to technology.\n\nThe tenth book, Through Fiery Trials, takes place after the Jihad between the island nation of Charis and the Luddite religious group, the Church of God Awaiting. Victorious, Charis continues to rapidly industrialize, further shifting the political balance of Safehold — even as the prophesied return of the Archangels draws ever-closer.\n\nSpanning over a decade on Safehold, Through Fiery Trials is a staggeringly impressive addition to the series Dave Duncan called \"the biggest thing in science fiction since Isaac Asimov's Foundation.\"\n\nThe four-novel series was published in reverse chronological order, so the books can be read in the order they were published, or chronologically. One of Butler’s most popular series, the books span generations and tell the secret history involving mind control and an extraterrestrial plague.\n\nChronologically, the series begins in the 17th and 18th centuries (Wild Seed) and focuses on Doro—an immortal man who survives by killing victims and taking over their bodies, and Anyanwu—a shape-shifter who heals instead of kills. Though Doro attempts to create a new race through a selective breeding program, he struggles to control them in Mind of My Mind, the second book in the series.\n\nClay’s Ark switches gears and is centered on a colony of diseased people who try to keep themselves isolated, while Patternmaster—the first book published, but the last chronologically, depicts a future in which humans are divided into three groups: the elite Patternists, the inferior and diseased Clayarks, and the enslaved mutes. The novel touches on race and gender issues through Teray, a Patternist who fights for his place in the organization.\n\nGreg Bear tells the story of an alternate universe where time and space are nonexistent. Those who travel between universes and planets fly their Flawships through “The Way,” a space and time tunnel that is integral in all three novels and can be accessed via the asteroid Thistledown.\n\nIn Legacy, the prequel, Olmy Ap Sennon uses “The Way” to head to Lamarcka—a planet with an ecosystem far different from Earth. Ap Sennon is sent to determine if humans can interact with the organisms there that are the size of continents; but along the way, he realizes that the planet is engaged in warfare and other problems send his mission awry.\n\nEon was published in 1985 and takes place 30 years in the future. The US and Russia (then the USSR) are on the brink of nuclear warfare in 2005 when an asteroid, “The Stone,” moves close to Earth’s orbit. “The Stone” was created by people across “The Way,” but these people live over one thousand years in the future.\n\nWhen a team of American scientists and theorists are close to figuring this information out on their own, Olmy Ap Sennon kidnaps a member of the team and learns about the impending fate of Earth. In Eternity, the impact of nuclear warfare leaves Earth desolate. “The Way” must be reopened in order to save those who remain and the future descendants who reside on a starship orbiting Earth.\n\nJoe Haldeman won a Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Award for The Forever War—the first novel in the series. In the first book, Private William Mandella fights light years away against the alien enemy. When he returns back to Earth, he thinks only two years have passed, but because of the space-time continuum it has actually been decades. He and the other soldiers find it difficult to adapt to all of the changes that have occurred since they left. They all go back to space combat, and each time they return, centuries have passed on Earth.\n\nIncluded in the series is “A Separate War,” a short story that explores the love between Mandella and Marygay Potter—who try to reunite even though they are separated by space and centuries. In the concluding novel in the series, Forever Free, Mandella finds himself choosing to spend time in Middle Finger, which is a partially frozen planet, so he can be with Marygay and his family.\n\nWhen outside forces request his genes in order to further evolution, Mandella and his family must escape…but the repercussions change their lives permanently. Fans of sci-fi and romances featuring star-crossed lovers will become enthralled with this series.\n\nIn the first book in the series, the Cold War-era conflict between Russia and the US escalates through time travel. The US is behind Russia with their technology, so they send along someone that they can afford to spare if everything goes wrong—Ross Murdock.\n\nThroughout the book, Murdock is sent back in history—from Britain in 2000 B.C.E. to the Baltic Sea. The series chronicles multiple time travelers and the conflicts that arise when they change the past in an effort to better the future.\n\nThis six-novel series was the runner-up for the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966, losing out to Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, which also made our list.\n\nThe plot of the series originates from the battle between the Arisians and the Eddidorians billions of years ago, which is detailed in the prologue book, Triplanetary. The Arisians created a powerful new breed of people through a eugenics project, which brings the action to modern-day Nevia. A planet far away from Earth, Nevia is quickly running out of iron–which is needed to sustain the amphibious race. The Nevians set their sights on Earth with technology powerful enough to retrieve iron from anywhere–even from the blood of humans. After destroying Pittsburg, the Nevians take three humans captive, but what they don’t know is that one of them is an undercover agent for Triplanetary Control named Conway Costigan. The fate of humanity rests on his shoulders.\n\nIn the other books in the series, the Lensman are the heroes—men who maintain order in Arisia by fighting outside attacks. They are noble, well-trained, and are willing to die for the Arisian people. From intergalactic drug trafficking to space pirates, there is no shortage of sci-fi conflict in this series that spans the course of time and the universe. The introduction of new characters still feels familiar since they are the offspring of your favorites from the previous novels.\n\nBe it a Hugo or Nebula, every novel in this three-book series is an award winner. In the first book, The Fifth Season, Essun comes home one day and discovers that her husband has murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. The same day, their empire, Saze, falls, and the majority of its citizens are killed. And to top it off, a physical tear in the continent leads to the downfall of ash with no end in sight.\n\nEssun determines that she has only one thing left to live for, and that is the safe retrieval of her daughter, whom she will get back at any cost.\n\nThe remarkable Dr. Ransom has been abducted and taken to the planet Malacandra, with his captors none other than his former college friends, scientists who plan to sacrifice him to Malacandra’s alien inhabitants.\n\nUpon landing, Ransom escapes and meets Malacandra’s aliens, experiences that fill him with both wonder and fear, as he attempts to figure out why his colleagues made the voyage to this world in the first place.\n\nWritten as a friendly bet with J.R.R Tolkien, Lewis’ book takes inspiration from H.G. Wells and David Lindsay to merge theology with science fiction.\n\nThe trilogy follows generations of characters over two hundred years living on Mars. Robinson explores the idea of Mars being a utopia when compared to Earth. The first book, Red Mars, details the colonization process on Mars in 2026, and the relationships between the settlers and the science of terraforming the area are major focuses throughout.\n\nIn Green Mars, terraforming takes root fifty years later and the colony begins to become self-sufficient. Warfare breaks out when natural disasters wreak havoc on Earth, leading to the culmination of conflict in the final book in the series, Blue Mars. The intricacies of modern societies, like education and healthcare systems are established on Mars and the issue of inter-planet immigration is explored.\n\nHari Seldon is a mathematician who spends his time researching psychohistory (the combination of history, statistics, and sociology), which can be used to make predictions about future human behavior patterns. When he is called to a trial to testify on the legitimacy of his studies, he reveals that he believes that his society will soon fall and there will be 30,000 years of unrest before another empire is created.\n\nHe convinces the board to let him study the best minds in the empire and create a collection of human intelligence. By doing this the empire will still fall, the fallout will only last 1,000 years. Seldon is sent to another planet with these minds in order to complete his work—a place called Foundation. But soon the group finds themselves in danger, and in order for the best minds to remain safe they must pit the other planets against each other.\n\nThe Foundation series was initially a trilogy, until Asimov’s publishers convinced him to write the fourth book in the series, Foundation’s Edge.

In the first book, three separate storylines ultimately converge into one, which is a technique that Reynolds uses throughout the series and in his other works.\n\nOne strand focuses on an archaeologist studying a civilization wiped out by the sun. Another centers on a woman traveling on a spaceship, who is looking for the archaeologist to help their captain who is suffering from some sort of plague. The final strand is about an assassin who is hired to kill the archaeologist.\n\nThe series differs from traditional sci-fi because Reynolds wanted the science in his novels to be attainable and realistic.

Pines appeals to mystery and thriller fans, as well as sci-fi aficionados.\n\nEthan Burke is a secret service agent who is sent to Wayward Pines, Idaho to find two agents who disappeared in the area the month before. A few minutes after arriving, Burke gets into a car accident. When he wakes up at the hospital, his ID, briefcase, and phone are gone. As Burke discovers more about the town and the weird happenings in it, he realizes that once you are in Wayward Pines, it is very hard to leave alive.\n\nIn the second novel in the series, Wayward, other residents begin to question how they ended up in the town, leading them to find out exactly what happens when they try to leave. The third and final book, The Last Town, ends with Burke finding out exactly why Wayward Pines is the way that it is.\n\nThere are ten books in this series, focusing on the utopian space society called The Culture. The socialist society is a conglomerate of humanoids and machines, so everyone is self-sufficient. War breaks out between The Culture and the Idrians—located across the galaxy—in the first book. The Culture is far more advanced than any other civilization in the galaxy, yet war ensues because the other groups do not share the same socialist ideals\n\nThe other books in the series detail numerous struggles between The Culture and the more “simple-minded” civilizations. As other societies develop, The Culture becomes entangled in frequent conflicts that could jeopardize the safety of its civilization.\n\nOriginally serialized in Analog magazine, Dune won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966.

The subsequent novels in the series focus on Paul, also known as Muad’Dib, as he ages, becomes the emperor, and tries to rule justly.\n\nThe original series contains six novels written by Herbert, but there is also a prequel trilogy, and a Legends of Dune series, featuring collaborations with Kevin J. Anderson and Frank Herbert’s son, Brian.\n\nThis science-fantasy novel tells the story of a woman who wakes up in middle of a dormant volcano.

The series is Octavia Butler at her best, exploring relationships between consent and coercion all while the US’s involvement in the slave trade and the Cold War haunts the background.\n\nAn interstellar polity governs the cosmos with one law—no killing of other sentient beings.
