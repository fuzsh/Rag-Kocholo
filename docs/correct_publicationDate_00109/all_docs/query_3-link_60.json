        "text": "In the world of literature, many fiction writers are known for blending facts with fantasies in such a way that their readers do not lose their perspective. Each and every author has his or her own style of writing which has kept their readers hooked and waiting – sometimes months and years on end.\n\nThe domain of fiction includes literary works, in different genres, which deal with various aspects of human life, from love to tragedy and life to death. Among these, the marine domain is an area that not many authors have chartered, but the ones that have done it, have done so with great skill and aplomb.\n\nKnown as Nautical fiction, this category of works tells stories of life at sea, explaining the complex human relationship with the sea and its uncertainties.\n\nDetailed below are ten such wonderful penmanship revolving around the domain of oceans and its immense vastness. These books have been greatly appreciated by readers across the world and are a must-read for those working at the sea.\n\n1. Moby Dick:\n\nWritten by American novelist Herman Melville in the mid-1850s, Moby Dick is considered to be a classic book which D. H. Lawrence once described as “the greatest book of the sea ever written.” Moby Dick or The Whale tells the story of the obsessive quest of Captain Ahab of the whaler Pequod for revenge on Moby Dick, the albino sperm whale that on the previous whaling voyage destroyed his vessel and bit off his leg at the knee.\n\nThe author has put the novel in the first-person point of view of Ishmael, whose character is shown to be that of a whaler. The book combines the aspect of revenge, orthodoxy and the then-vintage profession of whaling for ambergris. More than just a story of adventure, this masterpiece of Melville narrates a struggle between good and evil.\n\nMoreover, this works thrills readers when realising that a good part of the material of this book was drawn from Melville’s own experiences as a seaman aboard whaling ships.\n\n2. The Old Man And the Sea:\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea, written by legendary American writer Ernest Hemingway, tells a relentless, agonising battle of an old Cuban fisherman with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream.\n\nWith his simple and brilliant language, the writer narrates the patience and determination of the fisherman, Santiago, in his solitary struggle against his catch after days of unluckiness in the sea.\n\nAfter 84 days-long string of bad luck, a big Marlin takes hold of the line, however, leaving Santiago incapable of handling his catch because of its size. After three days of struggle in the sea, Santiago reaches shore only to see that his efforts were in vain.\n\nBeyond a thrilling tale, the novel talks about the battle of humans with the environment and even a fight against our own doubts.\n\nThe short novel, published in 1952, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1953 and acted as an important work in Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize in literature in 1954.\n\n3. The Perfect Storm:\n\nA creative nonfiction work based on the “1991 Perfect Storm” that hit North America between October 28 and November 4, The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea qualifies as a real-life thriller.\n\nWritten by Sebastian Junger in 1997, the book explores the impact of a massive storm that was caused by the freak meeting of two weather fronts through the story of a trawler, the Andrea Gail, and its six-man crew abroad. Its main component can be regarded as the perfect combination of incorporating a real-life incident with the author’s re-creation of the resultant happenings.\n\nSebastian Junger’s thoughts flow clearly and at no point in time would readers feel like keeping the book aside. Andrea Gail is immortalised in the hearts and minds of readers across the world, thanks to Mr. Junger literary contribution.\n\nThe book was made into a movie of the same title in 2000 by director Wolfgang Petersen.\n\n4.

Through this singular series, according to critics, C.S. Forrester has contributed his own uniqueness to the confluence of fact and fiction.\n\n5. Deadly Straits:\n\nR.E. McDermott’s first novel, Deadly Straits, is built around the context of marine terrorism and piracy as the name suggests and justifies its title with a fast-paced plot, which is disturbingly plausible. This maritime thriller, published in 2013, tells the story of a marine engineer named Tom Dugan, who becomes collateral damage in the War on Terror.\n\nWith his years of experience in the marine industry, the author could make the characters in the novel entirely familiar for those who have spent time in the marine industry.\n\nHowever, what adds to the book’s speciality is the fact that the author is able to put into written context, his imagination for the audience – especially for those who might not be that well-versed in the marine aspect. For those who love sequels, Deadly Straits sets up the right tone for a potential sequel, though it is unsure whether the author is planning to write one or not.\n\n6. Shogun:\n\nPenned by James Clavell in 1975, Shōgun is a maritime novel set in Japan around 1600 and tells the story of a bold English sailor who encountered two people who were to change his life – a warlord with his own quest for power and beautiful woman torn between two ways of life – after his ship was blown ashore in Japan.\n\nThe novel talks about a real-life person who rose to popularity amidst really troubling waters from the perspective of a Westerner. This unique confluence of an imaginary Western character meeting and understanding the larger-than-life Oriental hero defines the book as one of the all-time marine classics.\n\nShōgun, the first novel of Clavell’s Asian Saga, a series of six novels written by the author between 1962 and 1993, is an enjoyable epic despite the complex plot. Shōgun was a major best-seller as it had sold 15 million copies worldwide by 1990.\n\nNo products found.\n\n7.
