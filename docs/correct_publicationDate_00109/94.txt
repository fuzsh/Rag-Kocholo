Benford, Gregory. TIDES OF LIGHT. Toronto, New York, London, Sydney, Auckland: Bantam Books, [1989]. Octavo, cloth-backed boards. First edition. In this sequel to GREAT SKY RIVER, the galactic struggle between machine life and fleshly forms continues. Here cyborg entities, whose distant goal is a kind of godlike transcendence of the galaxy, use a 'cosmic string' to dismantle a planet. Such a story may be lacking in human interest (as far as some readers are concerned) but the physics and cosmology are up to date and the vistas which unfold are truly mind bending." - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition, p. 373. The fourth novel in the "Galactic Center" series, preceded by IN THE OCEAN OF NIGHT (1977), ACROSS THE SEA OF SUNS (1984), and GREAT SKY RIVER (1987). Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-106. Tiny paper defect in margin of pages 57/58, else a fine copy in fine dust jacket. (#155783).
