Therefore, it deals with the turning point of the late-Gothic artistic concepts to the Renaissance, during which the Latin treatise De Architectura (I century BC) by Vitruvius - in re-evaluation by the Italian cultural movement born in the Quattrocento and known as Vitruvianism - affected the invention of the modern ideas of Architecture and Architect. In the first part of the study, I propose (on the basis of an original approach to the text De Architectura) the division of all the research done under the Vitruvianism during the Renaissance into two distinct branches according to its objects and methods: the \"humanistic\"; and the \"mathematical/ techno-artisanal\". Considering this bifurcation on the setting up of new architectural theories, the training and practice of modern architects influenced by the Vitruvian text (especially in Italy, but also all over Europe), I also attempt to identify its influence on the Renaissance literature after Vitruvius - particularly on the excerpts regarding how the concepts of Architecture and Architect developed over time. The same subject also allowed to question some current ideas about the disciplinary vocation of modern architectural treatises, including their authors’ motivations, the quality of their main public reader, their influence over artists and patrons, and even their effects over the artistic practices and the aesthetic modulations of the architectural work. Evidence gathered from artistic literature helped me to adjust such perspectives: mainly texts by Francesco di Giorgio Martini, Antonio Averulino il Filarete, Raffaello Sanzio (and Baldassare Castiglioni), Luca Pacioli, and especially Leon Battista Alberti. The second part of the study readdresses these themes, as well as some of the conclusions stemmed from my earlier analyses, applying them to the specific study of the Portuguese architecture. Supported by some interpretations of the Vitruvian text found on Renaissance commentators and other main architectural treatises current in the Iberian Peninsula (by Leon Battista Alberti, Cesare Cesariano, Diegode Sagredo, Sebastiano Serlio and Francisco de Holanda), I also investigate the possible existence of a “Portuguese” idea of Architect based on the Vitruvian concept of architectus. Considering the various cultural and artistic Portuguese scenarios, this enquiry helps challenging some ideas established on a sheer historic perspective, and to better focus certain historiographical issues that concerned the profession of the Architect at the time - difficult to identify by any other methods. In general, it can be said that the first part of this study provides a fresh view on the treatise of Vitruvius and the Vitruvianism, suggesting that the ontological and epistemological concepts of Architectura and architectus derive from which I call here the \"Question of the Origins\" - one of the most persistent discussions in the artistic literature during the 15th and 16th centuries. Such approach - configuring a thesis - seeks to understand the various Renaissance modulations attributed to the Vitruvian-based idea of Architect, whose motivations I disclose in the various narratives about the origins and progresses of the architectural discipline registered in several passages of the treatise De Architectura. Assuming this work as one that seeks to open new avenues of research (more than to give definitive answers to precise questions), in the last chapter of the study I assess the Portuguese theoretical and critical production in the period 1521-1557. This evaluation is also done in the light of the Vitruvian \"Question of the Origins\" and its following enquiry to the modern figure of the architectus - both themes that, in earlier chapters of this study, I suggest having shaped all the research conducted by the Renaissance Vitruvianism. From a methodological point of view, I assume that Theory, Criticism and Art History are inseparable.\n\nAFONSO, LÃ­gia Filipa Dias, Days of departure. The SNI and the SÃ£o Paulo Biennial in the genesis of contemporary internationalization of Portuguese art (1951-1973), PhD in History of Art: Museology and Artistic Heritage submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Raquel Henriques da Silva and Agnaldo AricÃª Farias, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/52370)\n\nKeywords: SÃ£o Paulo; Estado Novo; National representation; Contemporary internationalization; National Secretariat of Information; SÃ£o Paulo Biennial\n\nAbstract: Hundreds of art pieces from Portuguese artists have been dislocated to “national representation” purposes, in between 1951 and 1973, during the Estado Novo dictatorial regime, from the post Second World War until the end of the regime and even after the arising of the Colonial War. The revelation of this fact, as long as the notoriety of the stages where the art pieces were exhibit - the new and restricted SÃ£o Paulo, Venice, Lugano, Paris Biennales - and by all the actors in this process (artists, critics, politicians and institutions), allowed us to consider that the SNI - The National Secretariat of Information, the official organism responsible for the regimeÂ´s propaganda - is in the genesis of the contemporary internationalization of the Portuguese art. Even though it has been neglected and forgetful by art history, the 1950 decade would determinate an irreversible (even though late) stage for the internationalization of the modern and contemporary Portuguese art, during and because the Cold War. The dawn of that decade points out the official impulse of the Portuguese participation in biennials, international largescale periodical exhibitions specifically dedicated to the fine arts that (with structural and conceptual modifications) still play an unavoidable leading role in contemporary art field and in the recognition of the artists’ career. This thesis proposes the investigation of the assumption through the subject of the Portuguese representation in the SÃ£o Paulo’s biennial, the only of this events that was systematically invested by the SNI. During its twelve first editions, between 1951 and 1973, 98 artists Portuguese artists displayed there 644 works of art, part of them belonging today to the most reputed national museum collections. This project survived the fall of the regime, first as a collaboration and subsequent organization of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and then with the return of the government investment, until the extinction of the national representation model in 2004. Over the research, interpretation and crossover of documental, textual and iconographic sources, most of them unpublished, from Wanda Svevo Historical Archive (in SÃ£o Paulo), the SNI Archive in the National Archive of Torre do Tombo and the Archive of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (both in Lisbon); this thesis proposes to develop and objectify what motivated this opening and continuity, how it was developed, who contributed or collaborated to its implementation and with which results.\n\nALMEIDA, Pedro Miguel Abelha de Lapa, Joaquim Rodrigo: The continuous reinvention of painting, PhD in Art History submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by VÃ­tor SerrÃ£o and LuÃ­s Urbano Afonso, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/11036)\n\nKeywords: Form; Colour; Composition; Grid; Sign; Structure; Language; Perception; Memory; Medium; Painting; Joaquim Rodrigo\n\nAbstract: After two years of self-taught, Joaquim Rodrigo’s painting come up to the forefront in 1952, engaged in the geometric abstraction trend that had just a few developments in the Portuguese context. He based his painting on the abstraction movements from the Salon des RÃ©alitÃ©s Nouvelles. The flat colours, cropped in non-rational geometrical forms overlapping each other characterize his first works. In 1954, he participates in the Ist Abstract Art Exhibition, and from that period on a process of rationalization of form and chromaticism took place. In a first moment, the forms were reduced to basic geometric elements he searched a colour theory nearby Herbin, then in a second moment he proceeded to a synthesis based on a modularization of pictorial surface with recourse to primary colours. The appropriation he does of Mondrian aims to provide a rationalist confrontation with this painter, regarding questions related to the division of space. In 1959, Joaquim Rodrigo constructs his own theory of colour that allows him to build a self-explanatory unity formed by surface, form and colour, characteristic of concrete art. However his painting suffers a radical twist, in 1961. Forms give way to signs and these organize in a narrative over the pictorial plane. The coexistence of these new elements with abstract structures, as the grid, confers on them new functions. Also an approach to the painting of non-Western cultures manifests in a new way, once that it reports the political relation between colonizer and colonized. These new paintings also confront the modernist interdict of narrative and claim themselves as testimonies of the political conflicts of the Portuguese life. The inscription of signs and its narratives in the surface’s opacity of painting rejects any analogy with the naturalist visual field in order to define painting’s surface as a space intended for the articulation of signs. From 1969 on a structural formalization of his own pictorial language reveals itself as his main task. The reduction of the palette to four colours (red, yellow, white and black) enables their mixture to define the pictorial surface and each one individually combined permit to trace the signs. These ones isolated in the surface are related to journeys. They are constituted from perceptions and their deferral by memory and from memory to its inscription in a process that dismisses any possible simultaneity between perception and knowledge. The relations established among signs are not explicit as each one is an event out of any order of causes and effects. A proliferation of codes and different semiotic regimes goes through them. The relationship with other cultures these signs manifest know is also a cultural translation that deprives any kind of dominance in the signification process as it happens in the framework of the Western culture. In that narrative and journey are equivalent, these signs constitute a practice of space. As a mnemonic process produced by painting, they consign it in an archive. In 1972, Joaquim Rodrigo organizes a retrospective exhibition of his own work at SNBA, which was well received by the critique and provided the understanding of the major relevance of his project. Joaquim Rodrigo developed a theoretical thought mainly concerned with the need to reinvent the medium of painting without rebutting modernist conventions on a reactive basis, but resetting them and building a new recursive structure for painting. The several redefinitions of his system brought him to build a pictorial language with a similar rigor of an idiom (langue), susceptible of everybody’s use and actualized in each performance. The final paintings, he develops from 1984 on, the only few integrated in the last theoretical system he had built, were designated as the right paintings. A new spatiality is declared as a collage and a metamorphosis of several space-times organized by the distribution of colour through quantitative areas. The relationship with archaic Greek painting and with pre-Socratic thought occupied him in that final stage, as traces of an immemorial always searched and vanished at each achievement. His last painting was executed in 1990 and a project for a wall in 1995.\n\nALMEIDA, SÃ­lvia Lucas Vieira de, Form and idea in nineteenth century sculpture, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Joana da Cunha Leal and Margarida Brito Alves, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/8393)\n\nKeywords: Nineteenth Century; Sculpture; Francisco Assis Rodrigues; VÃ­tor Bastos; Neoclassicism; Romanticism\n\nAbstract: This thesis is a critical study of 19th Century Portuguese sculpture with focus on the fundamental models and aesthetic concepts of two artists of different generations, Francisco de Assis Rodrigues (1801-87) and VÃ­tor Bastos (1824-94), who were key players in the Century's field of sculpture. This thesis challenges the traditional interpretation that their relationship was one of conflict and rivalry. The thesis reassess their relationship and explains how they encountered and influenced each other and in so doing shaped Portuguese sculpture. Their work is also understood in the context of a compare and contrast with the sculpture of the previous and subsequent periods, delineation of the similarities in their work and identification of references in national and international sculpture with special attention to the impact they had on 20th Century developments.\n\nALVES, Ana Margarida Duarte Brito, Space in XXth century artistic creation. Heterogeneity. Tridimensionality. Performativity, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Acciaiuoli de Brito, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/5813)\n\nKeywords: Contemporary Art; Space; XXth Century; Heterogeneity; Tridimensionality; Performativity\n\nAbstract: This dissertation aims to define a path across 20th Century Art by discussing the different approaches to the concept of space that were explored during that period. Drawing from the notions of Heterogeneity, Tridimensionality and Performativity - which are set as complementary perspectives for the study of that exploration - we conduct an analysis that is tensioned between an ideal, pure and abstract model of space, and a real, physical and lived one. The first part of this work takes as a reference the first avant-gardes and the debate on the autonomy of art that underlies them, evolves throughout the study of the transformation of the concept of sculpture, and examines the redefinition of the viewerÂ´s experience during the first half of the 20th century - establishing an orientation that tends to be defined as a trajectory towards real space. In a second part, we approach the more diverse context that defines the second half of the 20th century, and recognize a process of spatialization, which continues the previous dynamics, but associates new modes of production - that are translated in more complex models of space and that introduce different inflexions on the initial orientation. Opposing a perspective of linear evolution, this thesis introduces an interpretation based on the identification of a constant transformation, reconfiguration and conjugation of different space conceptions.\n\nALVES, Francine Oliveira, Aspects of the relationship between mosaic and architecture in the Roman world. Iconography and iconology of the theme of the wall in the Roman mosaic, PhD in History of Art: History of the Art of Antiquity submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Manuel Justino Maciel, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/6120)\n\nKeywords: Battlement; Tower; Gate\n\nAbstract: This research about relations between the mosaic and architecture in the Roman world, aims to analyze the crenellated borders in mosaic pavements. Developed in three parts, the work focuses on historical facts, analyzes the genesis of the theme and its transposition into the floor mosaic. The objectives of the study are the identification of iconographic expression and the apprehension of iconological content of the images.\n\nANDRADE, Sara Morais Saraiva de, The family pantheon and the adoption of classical-Renaissance vocabulary in the panorama of Portuguese tomb sculpture: the example of the AtaÃ­des chapel in the former convent of Santo AntÃ³nio da Castanheira, PhD in History submitted to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Universidade LusÃ­ada, supervised by Teresa Leonor MagalhÃ£es do Vale and LuÃ­s Manuel Aguiar de Morais Teixeira, 2015 (http://hdl.handle.net/11067/1514)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nANTUNES, Joana Filipa Fonseca, The Limit of the Margin in Art in Portugal (14th-16th centuries), PhD in History of Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Maria de Lurdes Craveiro, 2016 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/31385)\n\nKeywords: Art History; Iconology; 14th, 15th, 16th centuries; Margin; Marginalia; Parergon\n\nAbstract: To the Humanities in general, and Art History in particular, the margin has become a common-place. Thus, and despite its value to a better knowledge of the polychronic, heterochronic and anachronic objects of the past (Didi-Huberman), it urges to question its epistemological and operative limits. Framing the Portuguese artistic context between the beginnings of the 14th and the 16th centuries, this thesis addresses a period and a subject that have been particularly useful to Iconology: testing its own limits: decoding the images from the past; reevaluating the conflicted roles of text and images. Born within the realm of literature, the concept and terminology of marginalia was soon extended to codicology and has been lately applied to the margins of any artistic medium from the “long Middle Ages” (Le Goff) - a time that finds precisely at the margins a place of transformation and permanence, of (con)fusion with modernity. This thesis aims at questioning marginalia, while understandig the history and historiography of the margins, marginal images, ornament and superfluity. Also, it draws on the notion of parergon, from Derrida’s gloss on the kantian approach to the work of art (ergon). From that point of view, it proposes to deal with marginal images as necessary superfluities, dialogical and intrinsic to the work of art. To this study in particular, ergon will be either a religious building, a choir stall, a tomb or an illuminated manuscript, although many other types of objects will be called to provide iconographic paralells and clues. Divided in three main parts, this study will approach the history and teory of medieval marginalia, observing its specific presence and behaviour in Portugal from the 14th to the 16th century, and finally testing the thesis very own premisses through a specific case study, the sculptures of the Monastery of Santa Maria da VitÃ³ria (Batalha). One of its main goals is thus to extend the theoretical and material scope of the margin beyond the borders - more or less inhabited - of the illuminated page, and to direct it to the limits, the extremities, the interstices, the (in)visibilities of the work of art, built from the tension between its very centre and its margins. Although the margins contain the profane, the monstruous, the grotesque and even the transgressive, they are not defined by these categories. So, this thesis will also try to explore other themes and other meanings that express the participation of the margin in the center: through dialogue, complementarity, dilution, but not always (not necessarily), contradiction or paradox.\n\nARAÃJO, Raquel Aguilar de, Canvas that cross the Atlantic: Portuguese painting in Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo during the First Brazilian Republic (1889-1929), PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Sandra Leandro and Raquel Henriques da Silva, 2018 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/58094)\n\nKeywords: Naturalism; Portuguese painting in the transition to the 20th century; Brazilian painting; Collecting; Portuguese immigration; Luso-Brazilian exchanges\n\nAbstract: The positive welcoming of the Portuguese Naturalism that arrived in Brazil during the transition to the 20th century results from a variety of factors that transformed the painting produced by one of the most repudiated nationalities of the First Republic into goods widely sought and collected by the local market. The reading of the newspapers of that time confirms that the xenophobic environment experienced in the everyday life of residents of Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo did not have any effect on the devotion of the Brazilian buyers to the Naturalism sent from Portugal. The constant presence of the Portuguese painters in the tropics contributed to overcoming the barriers of social prejudice and diplomatic distance. On the other hand, the hundreds of paintings kept in Brazil stimulated the establishment of an effective cultural dialogue between the two sides of the Atlantic.\n\nASSUNÃÃO, Maria Manuela SimÃµes Baptista, Painters and their Public in Oporto.

Images and Meanings, aims to interpret the intrinsic meanings of naturalism in Portuguese paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries - Late Gothic, Renaissance and Mannerism - on the basis of a significant series of illuminations, \"fresco\" paintings and altarpiece paintings, which lead to the symbolic interpretation of the flora, fauna and landscapes represented. The research combines three distinct scientific subjects: Art History (Iconography and Iconology), Natural History (Botany) and Landscape Architecture (Landscape). Landscape paintings are defined and classified into five types: landscape of symbols, landscape of fantasy, ideal landscape, landscape of facts and real landscape. A large number of the represented landscapes have a deliberately symbolic meaning. These types of landscapes provide for a new perspective on the landscape’s role, as seen by the Portuguese painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including AntÃ³nio de Holanda, Ãlvaro Pires, AntÃ³nio Fernandes, Jorge Afonso, Vasco Fernandes, GregÃ³rio Lopes, CristÃ³vÃ£o de Figueiredo, Garcia Fernandes, Francisco Henriques, Mestre da LourinhÃ£, LourenÃ§o de Salzedo, TomÃ¡s LuÃ­s, Francisco de Campos, FernÃ£o Gomes, among others. In the List of Works of Art, comprising 350 paintings, and 304 species of plants and animals (flora 168 and fauna 136) were identified. Using a relational database, relevant works of art were analysed, in the field of illumination: Leitura Nova, Forais Manuelinos, King Manuel’s Book of Hours, Books of Hours, Countess of Bertiandos’ Breviary; in the field of mural painting: Casas Pintadas (‘Painted Houses’, Ãvora), Counts of Basto’s Palace (Ãvora), Ducal Palace of Vila ViÃ§osa, SÃ£o Bento de CÃ¡stris Monastery (Ãvora); and in the field of religious altarpiece painting: ancient altars in the chancel of the Viseu Cathedral, in the chancel of the Church of SÃ£o Francisco (Ãvora), in the chancel of the Church of theConvent of Jesus (SetÃºbal), in the Ãvora Cathedral, the main altar of the SantÃ­ssima Trindade Monastery (Lisbon), among others. We believe that the identification of aesthetic paradigms of landscape and the symbolic interpretation of species of flora and fauna depicted in the paintings of the period under study can provide a new look at the relationship between Man and Nature. We also found out that the majority of species of flora and fauna depicted have a symbolic character, rather than being merely decorative. The growing importance of the landscape, plants and animals in Renaissance paintings marks a new era in terms of knowledge, and art can reflect this growing interest in the natural world.\n\nBADAGLIACCA, Vanessa, Organic materiality in the 20th century art - Plants and animals (Human and Non-Human): from representation to materialization, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Brito Alves, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/18980)\n\nKeywords: Plants; New materialisms; Animals (human, non-human); 20th century art; Philosophical anthropology; Vitalism; Art and science; Environment; Matter; Materiality\n\nAbstract: The aim of this research is to focus on organic materiality in the 20th century art, for its appearance as a protagonist element presented in an artwork for what it actually is rather than as a mere component or instrument for chromatic or decorative purposes. By examining some works and specific case studies, organic materiality is suggested as a filter, and also as a sketch of a method to introduce the elaboration of a problem not to be solved, but to be left open to a variety of possibilities. Regarding the geographical span, this research has an international scope, mainly covering the artistic production carried out in Europe, Northern and Southern America, and Japan in some cases. In this sense, this work assumes its inevitable incompleteness as an attempt to find a place into a pluralistic theoretical discourse in art, and more specifically contemporary art, putting at its core matter as a matter of concern. The present investigation focuses on a kind of materiality that is, organic in the primal meaning of the term, in other words, an adjective “relating to or derived from living matter.” Therefore, in order to present the organic materiality of plants and animals (human and non-human) and their interactions with the 20th century art this research, over its chapters, counts on the contributions of history of science and medicine, and philosophical approaches such as philosophy of nature, philosophy of Vitalism, and philosophical anthropology. Moreover, the cycle of life of organic materiality became not only the object of research but also the method to study 20th century art from the point of view selected for this work, whose division in five chapters reflects this “organic method.” Proposing a spiral curve from birth, through youth, maturity, ageing and death with the increase of advanced technology and dissemination of digital media, the apparent disappearance of the organic, seems rather to propose a reformulation of its meaning. Motivated by contemporary artistic practices carried out in the first years of the 21st century, this research aim to understand the organic in the past century, investigating it from a theoretical point of view, but somehow by asking the organic materiality itself. In other words, the question on the levels of the organic and the human is developed by interrogating the same organic into artworks, not represented but presented, materialised.\n\nBAPTISTA, Paulo Artur Ribeiro, Stars and Aces: the photographic portrait in Portugal (1916-1936), PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Acciaiuoli de Brito, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/20195)\n\nKeywords: Portrait; Photography; Modernism\n\nAbstract: From late 1910’s and throughout the 1920’s the Fotografia Brasil, a Lisbon commercial portraiture studio, led by Joaquim da Silva Nogueira, introduced modernist practices in Portuguese photography, still dominated by late 19th century taste that had a strong expression in most Portuguese photographic studios. Lisbon was then a frequent scale to South America, and especially to Brazilian ports. The work of Silva Nogueira benefited a lot from the posing sessions with foreign artists that scaled Lisbon during their artistic tours. Since 1920, Fotografia Brasil became the leading supplier of artist portraits to the Portuguese illustrated press eager of pictures from theatrical activity. The background of the Fotografia Brasil photographic portraits activity may justify, for instance, the daring photo sessions with the Italian born dancer and singer Adria Rodi, whose audacious poses captured by Silva Nogueira’s modern photographic look surprised the conservative Portuguese society and established a model to the changes in photographic portrait practice. Photographs of other popular artists soon started to be regularly published in special sections of illustrated magazine face to face with international stars highlighting Silva Nogueira’s modern portraits. Though most of Portuguese stage artists called upon the services of Silva Nogueira throughout fifty year of his studio’s activity, it was during the 1920’s that he stood out establishing a special relationship with the actress, singer and dancer LuÃ­sa Satanela who played a key role in the transformation of the Portuguese theatrical scene. Satanela introduced modernist design costumes, sceneries and dancing choreographies in the stage performances of revista, a theatrical genre quite popular in Portugal. Silva Nogueira extensively portrayed Satanela in surprisingly modern photographic series, innovating over and over in an unusual complicity process, setting the pace for the decisive renewal of the Portuguese photographic portrait activity with emphasis in close-up and body image. Portuguese young artists and intellectuals tried to assert modernism in Portuguese’s conservative society. AntÃ³nio Ferro stood out in this role. As theatre critique he promoted modernist taste in theatrical productions, particularly in light theater. The campaign Ferro carried out in the press gave noticeable results. A transformation in theatre was noticed closing it to the cosmopolitan international productions. But Ferro also followed the same form of intervention in political propaganda, to which he started to devote himself even earlier of his nomination as director of the National Propaganda Secretariat. AntÃ³nio Ferro had a crucial role in visuality’s assertion in different aspects of the Portuguese society, from literature to journalism, theater and particularly politics. In national political propaganda, Ferro called upon photography and photographic portrait among other areas of visual arts to disclose the new regime, the Estado Novo, as well as his leaders, particularly the Prime Minister Oliveira Salazar. The assertion of Salazar’s visual discreet profile represented a major challenge to Ferro. Ultimately Ferro called the skills of the modernist photographer Silva Nogueira to succeed in capturing the official image of Salazar. That portrait stood in every governmental office and school. Finally modernism, throughout photographic portrait stand out as Portuguese’s institucional image.\n\nBARREIRA, Catarina Alexandra Martins Fernandes, Gargoyles: Representations of the ugly and the grotesque in the Portuguese context. 13th to 16th Centuries, PhD in Fine Arts: Science of Art submitted to the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Calado, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/2590)\n\nKeywords: Gargoyles; Ugly; Grotesque; Pedagogy; Exempla\n\nAbstract: The study of the gargoyles as representations of the ugly and the grotesque in religious buildings has proven to be an important approach to the medieval and late medieval imaginary in the national context. Apart from their utilitarian purpose, gargoyles mirrored the daily life of humans, their fears and tensions, their fascination with social and behavioral phenomena, and displayed, in the form of art, the confrontation between the religious and the social spheres, the critique and the example, taking on an important educational role amongst audiences. Such catechizing character gained special contours given the role of the gargoyles during the religious reforms of the 16th century, which coincided with the heyday of their placing in Portuguese constructions.\n\nBARREIRA, Hugo Daniel Silva, Images in the Moving Image. Documents and Expressions, PhD in History of Portuguese Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Maria Leonor Barbosa Soares and Nuno Miguel de Resende Jorge Mendes, 2017 (https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/110018)\n\nKeywords: Visual culture; Moving image; Cinema; Portuguese cinema\n\nAbstract: This thesis aims to analyze the moving image, understood in its double perspective of both document and expression. It is a work of a double nature, translated in its objectives as a methodological questioning of the study of the moving image, as to allow the formulation of approach proposals of the object based in its insertion in the contemporaneous visual culture. From the formulation of an interrogation grid of the moving image, which may serve as a helpful methodological instrument, resulted the development of a conceptual and operative frame of references based on what we call the four components of the moving image: “profilmic” component, photographic component, cinematographic component and sound component. The three proposed approaches, based on the methodological parameters defined and problematized, explore: the transmission mechanisms of images inherent to the perceived motion image seen as the result of a set of constructions; The object’s relation to the transformations of the technical environment from which it results and of which it is evidence; The issues of self-reference and self-questioning inherent in moving image. For this purpose, Portuguese films between the decades of the 30’s and 40’s of the twentieth century were defined as the corpus of objects. We are facing a shared collective iconography, which reflects itself in recurrent and transversal concerns to the various means, present in the transposition of mechanisms and in the appropriation of solutions, in direction to the individual researches and creation of objects that are constantly referenced and self-referenced. In the light of the obtained results, we perceive that these objects, due to the complexity of the path and visual culture of their actors, and also due to both culture and activity specifically as film buffs in many of them, are conceived not only as entertainment products, but also as a research field oh various areas of activity.\n\nBARROCAS, AntÃ³nio JosÃ© de Brito Costa, Blood salts. Body photographed: Theory and practice of photography in Portugal (1839-1930), PhD in Fine Arts: Science of Art submitted to the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Fernando AntÃ³nio Baptista Pereira, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/15632)\n\nKeywords: Photography; Body; Pose; Gender; Portrait\n\nAbstract: This thesis deals with the representation of the body in the Portuguese photography, between the years of 1839 and 1930. It analyzes both the thought - explicit and implicit - and the practices of the discourse produced on the representation of the body in Photography throughout the nineteenth century and early twentieth century. The main concept in our analysis was the 'Pose' - understood as the construction of figures of the body - in photographic representation. The pose is here understood as an essential procedure in assigning a meaning to representations of the body. The use of the pose is contextualized, where necessary, at the technical, cultural, social and aesthetic levels. Our analysis is systematized around vast semantic fields: Gender, Portrait, Death, the Social and Civilizational 'Other' and the Nude. The texts reviewed are of the period studied and come from different fields of written production. The central corpus of the analyzed images focused on two Portuguese periodicals: O Occidente and IllustraÃ§Ã£o Portugueza. These publications were fundamental in the Portuguese culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and they cover the period under consideration. Another collection of documents was the core of Portuguese periodicals devoted to photography: A Arte Photographica, published between 1884 and 1885, the only two issues of April and May 1887 of Boletim da Academia Portuguesa de Amadores Photographicos founded in November 27, 1886; the Boletim do GrÃ©mio Portuguez d’Amadores Photographicos which was published over three years, since June 1890 and until December 1892; the Boletim Photographico, published between 1900 and 1914, and, finally, A Arte FotogrÃ¡fica published between 1915 and 1931. A selection of both vernacular and fine art photographies was used as a 'control group' in the analysis of the trends identified in other sources. The current research used a content analysis methodology and focused on the corpus formed by the texts and images mentioned above.\n\nBELO, Albertina Marques Pires, The Third Order of St. Francis in the Region of Mata: implantation of the Franciscan Province of Santo AntÃ³nio do Brasil throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, PhD in History: History of Art submitted to the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Universidade LusÃ­ada, supervised by LuÃ­s Manuel Aguiar de Morais Teixeira, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/11067/621)\n\nKeywords: History of Art; Religious architecture; Heritage; Franciscan architecture; Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi; 17th and 18th centuries; Portugal; Brazil; “plain style”; Mannerism; Baroque; Rococo; Neoclassicism; Order of Saint Francis of Assisi\n\nAbstract: Understanding architecture of the Third Order of St. Francis in the Northeast of Brazil might put forward important knowledge concerning subjects of cultural heritage and their fundaments to properly ground sacred art and civilization. This understanding needs a closely analysis of spaces and their articulation, how they were conceived and built and how they were decorated. Such demand has taken us to the religious settlements of the former Franciscan Province of Saint Antony in Brazil whose remarkable architecture was built between the end of the 16th century and the 18th in Portuguese colonial territory. The study these religious institutions and their production proceeds along the analysis of constructive programs and understanding of their particular needs and also from the way how geography and topography of sites was brought together with their settle intentions. These buildings might create a referential to bring forth similar buildings that have been erected through the Portuguese Kingdom at different times and thus giving a holistic view of Portuguese culture in particular and Franciscan culture in general. A comprehensive acquaintance with buildings aims at the identification of type-like solutions that might be identified from simplicity or complexity of basic spatial units built after functional-symbolic frames that the whole building combine into an upper aesthetic and artistic synthesis. Consequently, formal stylistic criteria are not be forgotten and they closely relate to the so called Portuguese Plain Architecture and Tridentinas solutions and such features should be articulated with Baroque and Rococo European art and architecture whose taste was extended to Portugal and later to Brazil.\n\nBENTO, Maria JosÃ© Travassos de Almeida de Jesus, Convent of Christ - 1420-1521 - more than a century, PhD in History of Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Maria de Lurdes dos Anjos Craveiro, 2016 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/26539)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: \"Convent of Christ - 1420-1521 - more than a century,\" this title encapsulates the temporal space and the building has been chosen for the research work that led to this PhD thesis. It follows from this research, a first approach to the same period in the framework of the Master's thesis in Art History College of Arts, University of Coimbra, entitled The Convent of Christ in Tomar, the Infante D. Henrique Manuelinas to large contracts. It was intended, now, a deeper understanding of the pathways and the spatial relationships of the architectural structure of the convent building, which was both the headquarters of the Order of Christ, seeking to confirmation for many hypotheses envisaged under the Master. Alongside this, the ambition to understand the urban structure inherent in Intramuros village and its relation to the village below. At first sight the program seemed simple and aim for it consisted in continuation / confirmation of the research work done during the Masters. However, and with respect to the Convent and the Order of Christ, nothing is simple and much less objective. We are facing one of the most complex buildings in the history of National and World Architecture, rated Heritage. The proposed and planned methodology, which was structured, mostly from studies of GPR and archaeological surveys, proved in part fruitless since the current asset policy is not receptive, much less research funding works. Still, it was possible to perform some GPR scans, with the support of the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, but lacked confirmation has not been authorized by the entity that oversees the property, to repetition. It is clear that the issue of archeology has been completely abandoned by lack of funds, given that it is difficult to get permission to conduct any archaeological survey. Aware of this reality, the research was structured, mainly based on the documentary resources of the National Archives of Torre do Tombo, in particular Fund Order of Christ / Convent of Tomar, and continued observation and analysis of the constructed surfaces. Insisted in furthering knowledge during this timeline. The vastness of the topic in question and the need to establish points of comparison and critical analysis, forced the conclusion that each of these chapters is constituted by you as a new area of research. In fact, starting soon and the first chapter of this thesis, the Order and the aldermen, it was necessary to understand what kind of relationship Infante and D. Manuel had with the Order and to what extent is this relationship was crucial to the formation of structure convent. Knowing this dynamic, it progressed a little further in trying to understand the action of the Order in double urbanity village of Tomar, in character as landlord of the Order, the relevance of coexistence, to D. Manuel, the walled town and village riverside. In the villages, understand the reason that had given rise to the lay expulsion, of the walled town, by D. Manuel. But the central purpose of this investigation concerned the convent itself, and the house of his Regedor. It was absolutely necessary to clarify the origin of the convent Henrique's like building Cistercian mother even after being converted or converted to exoticism and exuberance manueline, retained its functional origin scheme by introducing only a few variations. But what were the reasons for these atypical features? And would the Convent of Tomar the only building to have these \"anomalies\"? And the palace of Regedor what the real reason for the construction of the palace into a mayor who does not reside in the place and the regularity with which travels to take does not seem to justify such an investment? What is the justification for not get lodged in the convent itself? The questions are always put in the link order / architectural object. The constant use of the image, the design and the virtual reconstruction of spaces is due and is absolutely necessary for understanding the structure and size of the architectural object in question. Witness in a building seven centuries of constant building project, in which mostly covered and reshaped the entire complex built, go back to the early fifteenth century and uncover the first three centuries of its construction, it proved a Herculean task fascinating and inexhaustible. This thesis would seem, therefore, as the rise of four centuries of construction and the target of an intense light on the constructive path occurred between 1420 and 1521, sought to clarify what the time was in charge of obscuring.\n\nBERENGUEL, Raul Fernandes, Gems of the contemporary period: new proposals for research, PhD in History submitted to the Department of Social Sciences and Management of the Universidade Aberta, supervised by Joaquim Fernandes da ConceiÃ§Ã£o and Maria Alexandra Trindade Gago da CÃ¢mara, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10400.2/2049)\n\nKeywords: Gemology; Art; History; Technologies; Laboratory apparatus\n\nAbstract: This study crosses History, Gemology and Contemporary Arts, in order to evaluate the application of traditional technical gemmological equipments in the investigation of gems used in Art objects. Therefore, it takes a historical digression on gems, with particular incidence in the Contemporary Epoch, where the imitations, falsifications, simulants and synthetics appears in an exponential and technically developed form. Considering that the historian interested in the application of gems in the Contemporary Art doesn't possess complex and expensive equipments, was tried to develop and adapt common devices and apparatus, with special attention to its use for the study of setting gems, barrier factor to their identification and evaluation. The recovery of old techniques and several experiences with existing common, but technically advanced materials, were equally investigated. This recovery, modification and improvement process was accompanied by the study of gems, with special concern for its evaluation and identification in physical, historical and artistic terms. In spite of not intending, in any way, to turn this work into a gemmological manual, we completed the methodology with the discussion and explanation of the techniques and fundamental gemmological concepts, as well as the normative bases of the classifications and evaluations used in gemology. This last one, being in itself, an art form, its junction with other works of art, namely in the profane and religious jewelry, takes it in the most recent centuries, to a blinding dynamics, in such a way, that the advanced technological resources are more and more necessary for its rigorous scientific study. This was the paradigm that drove to this study, bearing in mind the modest technical resources, where innovation and simplicity should be the allied of the historian that looks upon the study of the beautiful and the perennial.\n\nBOTELHO, Maria Leonor CÃ©sar Machado de Sousa, The historiography of the Romanesque period architecture in Portugal (1870-2010), PhD in History of Portuguese Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by LÃºcia Maria Cardoso Rosas, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/55076)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: In the international sphere, the appreciation of the medieval architecture commenced in the 17th century and increased throughout the 19th century. Only at that stage, in the first quarter of the 1800s, do the first studies which differentiate the formal, constructive and iconographic characteristics of the Romanesque style compared to the Gothic style begin to appear. The establishment of methodologies, the definition of chronologies and the stylistic characterization created a conceptual framework and launched the grounds for the development of the discipline in what concerns the alter ego of the Romanesque in relation to the Gothic. In Portugal, the study of the Romanesque occurs rather late when compared to the remaining European reality. The first artwork devoted to this artistic style dates from 1870 and its study has been carried out until the present day, being defined through successive phases of knowledge which reflect well dated approaches, themes and problematics. Nevertheless, the historiography conquests and developments made on the subject in the meantime, which materialize in a vast number of published works, largely contributed to the actual knowledge of the Portuguese Romanesque. The image that was construed of the Romanesque escorts the evolution of writings regarding such a representative moment of Portuguese architecture, which is linked to the foundation of Portugal and the kingdom of D. Afonso Henriques (1143-1185). This understanding influenced the manner in which the Romanesque period architecture was restored roughly during the first half of the 20th century. This is even more significant whereas this results in the current image of the Romanesque architecture, as we know it today. Throughout this wide chronology, three authors are distinguished due to the conceptual breakout defined by their thoughts and their writings. The publishing of the first artwork devoted to the Romanesque architecture, the Reliquias da architectura romano-byzantina em Portugal e particularmente na cidade de Coimbra, dated 1870 is owed to Augusto Filipe SimÃµes (1835-1884). With Manuel Monteiro (1879-1952) the grounds of the subsequent historiography on Romanesque period architecture in Portugal were launched, by defining typologies, classifying dialects, establishing chronologies and identifying influences. Only later with Carlos Alberto Ferreira de Almeida (1934-1996) a new conceptual breakout in the writings on Romanesque was felt, due to the fact that this author, amongst many other aspects, tried to understand the Romanesque in its era and its profound anthropologic relationship with the territory where it is located. The originality of the Portuguese Romanesque commenced being recognized by the Romanesque historiography. Its intimate relationship with the territory, the nuclear importance which its architectonic testimonies acquire in the territorial organization, at diversified levels, has been taken on board by those devoted to its study. Additionally, the perception of the strong presence of foreign influences, despite the associated problematics and adapted in a specific context where prior artistic existences acquired a nuclear role, enhance even more the unique character of the Portuguese architecture in the Romanesque period.\n\nBRANCO, CÃ¡tia Cristino Correia Teles e Marques de Sousa, The sacristy and the Portuguese episcopal order in the period of the Catholic reform.

As such, it seeks to analyse the way in which the artefacts produced by these artists both act as mediators and creators of a cultural identity that is negotiated and shared. It therefore presupposes various lines of intersection between the wide-ranging theoretical debate about issues of national identity and contemporary visual art, adopting an approach normally employed in Culture Studies in general, and Visual Culture Studies in particular. Representations of Portuguese cultural identity in art are considered in terms of three basic areas of analysis: examples of (re)mediation and (re)figuration of the Portuguese collective image which, in drawing upon historical, literary and art-related texts, place the sea at the centre of the shared identity of the Portuguese; a renewed look at various traumatic episodes from the country’s recent past, in particular the Estado Novo and the Colonial War, as fundamental features that are woven into the contemporary sense of identity; and Post-Colonialism as a byword and key concern when recasting the past into the present, forging links between cultural identity and the creation of a visuality that is informed by social relationships. Through a hermeneutic approach to specific works by six Portuguese artists - JoÃ£o Pedro Vale, Joana Vasconcelos, Maria Lusitano, Pedro Barateiro Vasco AraÃºjo and Francisco Vidal - which are suggested as the mediators for an anterior visuality, or afterimages, it is argued that the construction of the Portuguese imaginary community is shaped by the dialectic relationship between pedagogy and the performance-related aspects of the narration - be it visual or otherwise - of the nation. It is also argued that the works that make up the body of the analysis form a seminal system of discourse in the process of creating a sense of culture and in the activation of mechanisms for celebrating, questioning and creating or dismantling Portuguese cultural identity. The text also seeks to discuss the areas of overlap between contemporary art and Culture Studies, pointing out the aspects that are unique to each field.\n\nCAETANO, Joaquim InÃ¡cio, Decorative motifs of stamps for fresco paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in northern Portugal: Relations between mural and easel painting, PhD in Heritage Sciences and Restoration Theory submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by VÃ­tor SerrÃ£o, 2010 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/2829)\n\nKeywords: Fresco painting; Studio; Stamp; Pattern; Imitation coating\n\nAbstract: This dissertation focuses on the fresco paintings of the XV and XVI centuries in the North of Portugal with the aim of studying decorative patterns executed with transfer print. It is a study which generates from the conservation and restoration of mural painting and the observational opportunities it offers, an activity we have been developing since the beginning of the 1980s. The identification and collation of patterns in regard to patterns in other paintings have allowed us to identify various groups of paintings which share affinities. We later found each of these groups constituted the corpus of several mural painting studios working actively in this time period and location. We were simultaneously aware of the existence of traces, particularly in religious spaces, of other decorative “fads” such as colour directly applied onto architecture or the manner in which the joints of the construction systems were handled. We find these “fads” to be prior to the period of great production of fresco mural painting around the first half of the XVI century, preceding the first romanesque constructions, whose nature is synthesized in fresco painting through its representation in painting itself, through the imitation of brocade and wall hanging tapestry which would cover walls, vestiges of which exist only in pictorical representation. We also noted the majority of the patterns taken into inventory have a visual referent and show similarities with other forms of decorative grammar such as the romanesque, gothic or mudejar styles, or imitation of brocade design. In this constant collation with patterns of other origins we found the same pattern, stamped with the same stamp on fresco panting and easel painting, therefore deducing it all to be produced by the same studio. We also referenced other cases of studios that paint both genres, which would be common practice.\n\nCAETANO, Joaquim Oliveira, Jorge Afonso.

By family links, by professional connections or as Royal representative for the supply and control of works, he was at the very center of the great artistic works of his time. He built a career as Herald what made him an important figure in King D. Manuel’s court. To Jorge Afonso are attributed the large paintings of the ‘Christ’s Convent’ Ambulatory in Tomar, eight paintings from the ‘Madre de Deus’ monastery and the ‘Covent of Jesus’ altarpiece in Setubal. This dissertation reanalysis the painter biographical data, studies the paintings including its underdrawing and reconstructs the understanding of Portuguese painting of that time, perceived under the influence of this tutelary figure.\n\nCALHEIROS, LuÃ­s Filipe Ferreira da Bandeira, Praise of the ugly in art: ugliness in the 20th century, PhD in History of Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Coimbra, supervised by Maria de Lurdes Craveiro and Dalila Rodrigues, 2015 (https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/27133)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: This text records a research work in which has been advanced an interpretative theoretical thesis, based on an art history profile, trying to make an aesthetic hermeneutics in the 20th century, proposing the Belo-ugly concept as the identifier sub-categorical aesthetic concept of half of the artistic creation of more relevant cultural impact in the 20th Century Art, particularly in the art of painting, which will be the addressed artistic subject. The theoretical approach of the particular aesthetics phenomenology and its axiological characterization was based on the philosophical thought of authors such as Aristotle, I. Kant, GWF Hegel or in 'Masters of Suspicion\", FW Nietzsche, K. Marx and S. Freud. Several essayists who hardly studied the phenomenology of ugly and its determination as theoretical-critical sub-category inside the aesthetic system, as Umberto Eco or, for example Lydie Krestovsky, Raymond Polin, Eugenio Trias, Pedro Azara, among others, have also been consulted, especially Karl Rosenkranz, GWF Hegel’s disciple, which was one of the most important authors as far as the theoretical study of the ugly and artistic ugliness is concerned. Critical judgments of the reasoning discourse that sought to be unmistakeable in the interpreting analysis of studied phenomenology empirical evidence, have been based, for factual evidence purposes, into statement by image, from the numerous exempla of works of aesthetic ugliness of artistic movements in the 20th century or into contemporary independent artists, exhibited in indispensable iconographic attachments. From the studied works of art, the new aesthetic paradigm in the 20th century was configured. It has been made an exhibition through an extended illustrating block of the advent of new forms and new artistic contents in the 20th century, revealing the aesthetic climax of an ugliness that ubiquitously characterizes century art painting, both testimonial register and sublime transfiguration of real ugliness from those modern times.\n\nCARDOSO, Maria LuÃ­sa Lopes de Oliveira Ferreira, Art History and Cold War, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Acciaiuoli de Brito, 2012 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/9762)\n\nKeywords: Art Historiography; Cold War; Modernism; Socialist Realism\n\nAbstract: How was the making of art history that would become hegemonic in the U.S. and Russia during the Cold War influenced by its historical context? In what way did that context promote a particular way of doing art history to the detriment of other available alternatives or competing options in each block? What is the relationship between the models of artistic historiography that became dominant in each country during that period? Calling upon the concept of “paradigm” as defined by Thomas Kuhn, through an analysis of the critical, theoretical and historiographic discourses as well as their historical contextualization, this research aims to trace the development of the paradigms of artistic historiography that became dominant in the U.S. and Russia during the Cold War. The first part of this work analyzes the emergence period of a North-American modernist and of a Russian socialist realist art history in the 1930’s. A second part is devoted to the refining and affirmative period of these paradigms during the 1940’s and 1950’s. Finally, in a third part, we consider the first signs of the questioning of the two historiographic paradigms that emerge systematically from the 1960’s, either through the challenges posed to them by the artistic production, or through their internal historiographic revisions. What this path reveals is the historical and political convenience of the historiographic paradigms that became hegemonic in the cultural dispute between the two blocks in the Cold War; their employment (official or unofficial) as part of an emblem of national identity by the strategies of cultural diplomacy; and a relationship of complementarity between them both, to the extent that the symmetry of their antagonism translates the indispensability of the “other” in the construction of a cultural identity - which, together, embodies the bifurcation of a cultural utopia of Modernity.\n\nCARRUSCA, Suzana Andreia do Carmo, The Baroque Tiles in Convent of the Carmelite Order and the Order of the Discalced Carmelites in Portugal, PhD in Art History submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by JosÃ© Alberto Gomes Machado, 2015 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/15957)\n\nKeywords: Tiles; Baroque; Iconography; Carmelites; Convent space; Integrated heritage\n\nAbstract: This Doctoral dissertation main aim is to make known, in its artistic components, iconographic, iconological and doctrinal, the tiles held in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for male and female convents of the Carmelite Order and the Order of Discalced Carmelites in the European Portuguese space, which will fill in major gap in the historiography on the Portuguese artistic baroque tiles of religious Orders, in particular, and the Portuguese art of the Counter-Reformation in general. Based on an exhaustive survey of the remaining ceramic representations and methodological tools of Art History research we intend to perform a descriptive-analytical research contexted in the Carmelite tiles of the Baroque in Portugal. The investigation, which focuses on the art of tile, but also the creation of a route of a Carmelite Lusitanian art, brings, together three scientific disciplines: Art History (artistic analysis, iconographic and iconological), History of Spirituality (relationship between spiritual and artistic reality in the Carmel) and History of Culture and Imagetics (globalizing relationship of the image in spaces and realities of distinct communication).\n\nCARVALHO, Maria do RosÃ¡rio Salema Cordeiro Correia de, Tile painting in Portugal (1675-1725).

This period correspondes, generally, to the Ciclo dos Mestres (Master’s Cycle), a designation based on the exceptional quality of the painting and on the architectural integration achieved. The first part of the dissertation puts together the information already well known and the new one that was discovered during this study, about the team working actively during the conception, production and application of azulejos, i.e, azulejos-maker(s) (azulejadores), potter(s) and painter(s). Regarding the painters, we intended to re-evaluate the Portuguese Art History attributions. In this sense, the azulejos signed or documented were specially considered, and they were the base for the appreciation of the attributed azulejos. We propose a flexible model that allows to organize the azulejos in situ and the panels in a more open way, not forcing the identification of the painters. There were certainly much more than those we know today, and the collective ways of working, the collaborations, the themes replicated and so on, makes the organization by authors very difficult. Finally, we discuss some questions about the azulejos painting during the period studied. The second part, which results from the analysis and discussion of the data from the first part and the attachments, pretends to follow the different procedures for application of the azulejos in the buildings for which they were conceived. It includes the order, the project, the manufacturing and preparation of azulejos, the painting, the application, and ends with the reception or the perception of the work by the contemporaries. Meanwhile, we discuss the importance of the azulejador, how the painting was done, what were the visual sources that inspired the painters, namely, engravings and their use, exploring, as well, the integration in architecture and the sense of narrativity intrinsic to the way Portuguese used azulejos. Summarizing, we want to present a global perspective about the production of azulejos between the end of the 17th century and the first quarter of the 18th century, including all its different aspects.\n\nCARVALHO, Maria JoÃ£o Crespo Pimentel Vilhena de, The sculptures of Ernesto Jardim de Vilhena.

Ferreira do Alentejo 1876 - d. Lisboa 1967) was the most important art collector in Portugal during the first half of the 20th century. The objects of his legacy are unavoidable within the national heritage, whether belonging to the State or being private property. 1500 sculptures were given in donation to the Portuguese State by his heirs in 1969, and became property of the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (MNAA) in 1980. Their classification as monuments in the national heritage is due not only to their intrinsic artistic quality but also to the work developed from that moment on by the MNAA. The dichotomy - Collector and Museology, which constructed the history of the sculpted image in Portugal - is the primary subject matter of this research. Concepts of culture and biography of objects, taste, definition of the patterns and ways of collecting for the Portuguese culture of the first half of the 20th century also contribute as analytical bases to understand the personal Ernesto de Vilhena's concept of heritage.\n\nCASTILHO, Liliana Andrade de Matos e, The city of Viseu in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Architecture and Urbanism, PhD in History of Portuguese Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by LÃºcia Maria Cardoso Rosas, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/67328)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: Not available\n\nCASTRO, Maria JoÃ£o Roque e, Dance and Power or the Power of Dance: Dialogues and Clashes in the Twentieth Century, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Acciaiuoli and JosÃ© Sasportes, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/13093)\n\nKeywords: Art; History; Ballet; Dance; Choreographers; Dancers; Power; Politics; Propaganda; Ideology; XX Century\n\nAbstract: Within the History of Contemporary Art framework, the research presented herein relates the role of art with the power of dance, featuring its dialogues and confrontations throughout the twentieth century. Used as a vehicle of propaganda, dance became an art easily politicized and compromised with its framing regime. The common thread of the study covers a journey marked out between the time that dance emancipated opera -with the emergence of Ballets Russes in 1909 -until the celebration of the centenary of the company in 2009, date in which there were reflections on Ã la longue terpsichorean contemporary universe. It is a whole century that set from a new political and artistic relationship developed not only to the authoritarian regimes of the first half of 1900, but also present in liberal-democratic regimes in the last half of the twentieth century. Positioning itself in two different vectors -appointment or revolt -this study analyses across the international scene and national production, crossing the double vision of the power game of dance and dance of power and integrating them into the main creations produced over the last hundred years.\n\nCERQUEIRA, JoÃ£o Francisco Delgado, Through never before sailed Seas: JosÃ© de GuimarÃ£es on the Route of Discoveries and the Encounter of Cultures, PhD in History of Portuguese Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by Agostinho Rui Marques de AraÃºjo and Margarida Maria Acciaiuoli Homem de Campos Brito, 2011 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/55085)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: This thesis is about JosÃ© de GuimarÃ£es relation with Portuguese Discoveries and his wish to promote the encounter of the different cultures.

Miguel, Azores, between the 17th and 19th centuries, PhD in Art History submitted to the Institute for Advanced Studies and Research of the Universidade de Ãvora, supervised by Alexandra Gago da CÃ¢mara, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10174/19160)\n\nKeywords: Worship; Devotion; Identity; Imaginary; Immateriality; Memory; Heritage; Ritual; Tradition\n\nAbstract: The theme proposed as object of study in this thesis is the result of a research dedicated to the custom of adorning religious sculptures and displaying them in Franciscan penitential processions between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, in the island of S. Miguel, Azores. This type of religious expression, particularly characteristic in the Ibero-American space, featuring up by scenic originality, in which clothing and scenic props are used to complement the respective sculptural groups, called religious sculptures for dressing. In the Azores, the Venerable Third Order of Penance had a major role in organizing these processional events, and the islands of S. Miguel and Terceira currently represents one of the last holdouts in organizing penitential processions, with the use of religious sculptures for dressing. In the case of S. Miguel, this type of imaginary can still be seen in the collections of some of the ancient Order of the convent churches of the Friars Minor existing on this island, and the only procession coming from the penitential spirit of the Third Order, which is held annually in the city of Ribeira Grande. The study now being presented aims to understand the various components of the use of such imaginary, and the recording of heritage legacy that the Franciscan secular perpetuated to the present day, materialized in a patrimonialization process of their dress images, expressed in the dichotomy between objects, as matter, and their biographical realities, linked to third-party communities that were behind the use of these processional images.\n\nCOELHO, Teresa Maria da Trindade de Campos, Nunes Tinoco, a dynasty of royal architects, PhD in History of Art: Art History of the Modern Age submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Rafael de Faria Domingues Moreira, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/20258)\n\nKeywords: Mannerism; Baroque; 17th and 18th centuries; Tinoco; Portugal; Architecture; Architect; Profession\n\nAbstract: The current doctoral thesis aims at tracing the life and career path of the Nunes Tinoco, one of the most important Portuguese families of royal architects, back to the 17th century and early 18th century. Their activity spanned from the reign of the Filipes to the reign of king John V and had a tremendous impact on the Portuguese architecture, transmitting, generation after generation, a whole tradition of knowledge and skills, as, in the future, it would be the case of other families, such as the Frias and the Couto, only to mention the most influential. After having systematized this family membersÂ´ biographical data and information about their professional activity, integrating it in the social context of that period, we intend to clarify some issues we consider important about the techniques and characteristics of architecture during this time, pointing out the relevance of the family structure concerning the facts we considered fundamental for this study: the passage from head mason to architect and the resulting new social status; training, performance, posts assignment, contribution to the binomial family/techniques Portuguese architecture speech. Finally, we purpose to establish the evolution of their professional status, linking it with the evolution of architecture itself and with the cultural and social changes occurred over this period.\n\nCORDEIRO, Filipa Raposo, Thomas Luis, a mannerist painter of the sacred and the profane: Art, conservation and restoration. Cases of Ãvora, Aldeia Galega, Elvas, Idanha-a-Nova and Vila ViÃ§osa (16th to 17th centuries), PhD in Heritage Sciences and Restoration Theory submitted to the School of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by VÃ­tor SerrÃ£o and AgnÃ¨s Le Gac, 2014 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/11426)\n\nKeywords: Thomas Luis; Altarpiece; Wall painting; Mannerism; Sixteen and seventeen century; Iconography; Analysis; Materials and techniques; Pathology; Conservation and restoration\n\nAbstract: The goal of this thesis is to present an interdisciplinary and innovative study about the altarpieces and wall paintings by the English painter Thomas Luis (Thomas Lewis). These paintings, created between c. 1582 and c. 1603, are located in five areas in Portugal: Ãvora, the old Aldeia Galega (actual Montijo), Elvas, Idanha-a-Nova and Vila ViÃ§osa. There are few studies about Thomas Luis, who has not been given sufficient recognition when compared with more productive painters (like Diogo Teixeira, SimÃ£o Rodrigues and Francisco JoÃ£o), in spite of his monumental paintings, which should be acknowledged, as they are unique. His paintings can be found in religious and private buildings. They show evidence that Thomas Luis’s patrons had an erudite taste and culture, concurrent with the best that was produced not only in Portugal, but also abroad (in neighboring Spain, in Germany, in Flanders and Italy). Ten pictorial groups, composed of one hundred and seventy eight themes (including the ones that disappeared), are herein justified in terms of authorship, as being by Thomas Luis. The research method chosen was imposed by the object, that is, by the paintings themselves, which, in fact, “write” Thomas Luis biography. His masterpieces were studied in a pluridisciplinary way, through six perspectives: historic (space and time contexts, patrons and Maecenas); iconographical and iconological (exploring the meaning of sacred and profane themes in documents and literary sources); stylistic and artistic (showing possible influences, from various art fields - engraving, illumination, easel and wall paintings, tiles, wood and stone works -, in Thomas Luis work); material and technological, using surface and local methods of exam and analysis (MEA); “transmemorial” history (chronology of the alterations and Conservation and Restoration interventions, using MEA), Museology, proposing ways for a wider acquaintance of Thomas Luis work, exhibited in cultural places (church and museum), and Curadory, recommending not only “authenticity” criteria for the exhibition of sacred heritage, but also preventive conservation guide lines to ensure its lasting preservation, explaining the role played by the conservator-restorer in those areas. This work aims to acknowledge, preserve and project Thomas Luis work to a wider audience and promote the Cultural Heritage Tourism.\n\nCOSTA, SimÃ£o Palmeirim, The Acquisition of Renaissance Artistic Space in Portuguese Painting from c.1411 to c.1525: Geometric and Compositional Competences of the Late Middle Ages to the Renaissance, PhD in Fine Arts: Science of Art submitted to the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Fernando AntÃ³nio Baptista Pereira and AntÃ³nio de Oriol Trindade, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10451/25111)\n\nKeywords: Geometry and Composition; Renaissance Portuguese Painting; Altarpiece; Geometrical Skills; Instruments and Designs\n\nAbstract: It is a well-known fact that Geometry plays a fundamental role in medieval and renaissance artistic practices. With this thesis we propose an in-depth study on how geometric knowledge is manifested in Portugal, during one of the richest moments in the country’s history. Understanding the compositional and geometrical skills acquired and applied by a certain author or painting workshop implies both theoretical and practical education. Based on the knowledge of geometrical methodologies and on a vast group of information and documental data concerning the History of Art. Once we determined the time frame, selected the corpus of paintings and gathered the geometric tracings to test, we proceeded to do an exhaustive sequence of compositional studies on the group of works of art in question. A comparative analysis of the results allowed us to list a series of conclusions around the central theme and, most importantly, to define the itineraries of renaissance visual composition in Portuguese Painting between the beginning of the 15th century and the first quarter of the 16th century.\n\nCOUTINHO, SÃ©rgio Manuel de Carvalho, The European vanguard: between \"Globalenation\" and \"Human Unity\", PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Acciaiuoli, 2015 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/14995)\n\nKeywords: Artistic vanguard; Europe; Globalization; Rage; Irony\n\nAbstract: The present doctoral thesis aims to analyze the concept of artistic vanguard, as well as to investigate if the existence of an artistic vanguard is possible in the XXIst century. Presented throughout history indifferent perspectives, the avant-garde genetic should be restudied and redesigned defining its connection to modernism and cosmopolitanism, furthermore identifying its objectives and its geo-social dynamics. If in the beginning of the XIXth century the French saint-simonian and mathematician Olinde Rodrigues considered urgent, but also impossible, that the artistic vanguard should prevail politically, it’s, then, important to know what changed so that the artistic front can advance in the battlefield. It’s essentially on the reinterpretation of this first “manifest” that this investigation establishes its foundations. It’s also important to note the usefulness that certain concepts like “rage” and “globalization” possess, to which the studies of the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk that serve as a starting point. The vanguard military terminology shouldn’t be ignored either. The artistic army should have a specific training to attack with all his strength, as to be able to identify its different targets throughout history. Take into consideration that Europe is the investigative field. European vanguard has a singular profile that connects not only to memory, but also to its utopian unity and to the singularity of its criticism. The existing concept of vanguard should be questioned in the XXIst century. This is a Europe defined by the fall of the Berlin wall and fearful of terrorist attacks, defined by the reappearance of extremist groups in the European community and by a Russia that lost its offensive modesties. A time when wars are made with drones and when the internet allows a reorganization of activism, but is also a stand towards a controlled reality. In this outlook it’s hard not to be cynical.\n\nCOUTINHO, VÃ¢nia Maria, Carmina figurata and Carolingian image theory: contributions to a reflection on the text-image relationship, PhD in History of Art: Art Theory submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Joana Cunha Leal and Maria Adelaide Miranda, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/19090)\n\nKeywords: Carmina figurata; Rabanus Maurus; “Ad Bonosum”; Carolingian Period; Ut pictura poesis; Image Theory; Word and Image\n\nAbstract: The thesis focuses on the figured poems composed between c. 780 and c. 814, by Alcuin, Josephus Scottus, Theodulf and Rabanus Maurus, related with their contemporary political, social, cultural and religious circumstances. These works not only reverberate a comprehensive ideological project, but also build it. Despite the fact they are engaged with the dominant elite, the poems - surely by the existence of images that bestow their originality - express their own life, their presence, and one capable of generating effects in the common space. There is a remarkably numerous production of figured poems in the very same period in which the Carolingian court addresses the Byzantine quarrel of the images. Some of the Franks’ arguments of the Libri Carolini are considered in order to ponder if they formulate a sort of ‘image state theory’, to which the figured poems, namely the ones composed by Rabanus Maurus, would respond. According to some historiographical approaches, under appreciation would be the value of the Scriptures and of the writing culture over the image, a notion also confirmed in Rabanus Maurus poem “Ad Bonosum”. Hence, the Carolingian figured poetry would be subordinating its full visuality to the Word, to the text, to its meaning and spiritual vocation. Figuration, devoided of its materiality, would act primarily as an appeal to the invisible and to an experience of religiosity. An idea that is under discussion in this research, along with the difficulty in stabilizing one single conception of image. Bearing in mind the origin and poetic lineage of the figured poems, as well as their reception at specific moments in history, it is explored how the resistance to the full acknowledgment of their pictorial features has its own historical background. That is, contexts where an antinomy between text and image is formed - namely through the modern period dispute between painting and poetry or through the development of logocentric epistemological paradigms (of theological, cultural or political origin) - constrain, even today, our models of analysis of the carmina figurata. In this sense, the image is presented as irreducible to multiple textualizing solutions, in order to see what the figured poems show, alongside with what they say. The goal is also to focus on the effects of the image, harbouring the unique qualities of figured poetry well beyond the strict opposition between word and image, and the discussions about the supremacy of the word. The reflection on image presented in Rabanus Maurus’ and Theodulf’s works offers a remarkable opportunity to discuss notions of the medieval image. Its conceptual and theoretical contributions to Art History and to the critical studies of the relation between word and image are undeniable, and they are so besides their temporal circumstance.\n\nCUNHA, MÃ¡rio Raul de Sousa, (...) Visitamdo nÃ³s ora pessoalmente o dito mestrado de Samtiaguo (...). The Churches of the Military Order of Santiago. Architecture and Materials, PhD in History of Portuguese Art submitted to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of the Universidade do Porto, supervised by LÃºcia Maria Cardoso Rosas, 2013 (http://hdl.handle.net/10216/72367)\n\nKeywords: Not available\n\nAbstract: This thesis aims to describe and analyse the churches and chapels of the Military Order of Santiago in the period between the years 1510 and 1571, dates that correspond, respectively, to the first visitations conducted by Master D. Jorge de Lencastre (Visitation of SetÃºbal, July 1510) and the last of a series of inspections carried out in the sixth decade of the Fourteenth Century, which extend effectively until the early years of the next decade (Visitation of Palmela, September 1571). For this purpose it has been done not only a survey and study of the visitations to the commendations of this period, already published at this moment, but also a transcription and publication of the sixteenth century Visitations of AlcÃ¡cer do Sal, until now unpublished, namely those which belong the years of 1512/1513, 1535, 1552, 1560 and 1565, which are compiled in the Appendix. This work has identified a collection of about 220 temples, some of which have disappeared or have been radically transformed. Patron saints and specific devotions, spaces and forms, measurements and materials, attitudes and beliefs were determined. And, as far as possible, visitors’ perceptions of what they saw have also been determined. The territory in this study incorporates the main military nuclei south of the Tagus, including the Sado region, with a particular emphasis on SetÃºbal, Palmela and AlcÃ¡cer do Sal, Low Alentejo, where MÃ©rtola was of utmost importance as a former headquarter of the Order, and an extensive domain network that stretched from Levante to the West, from the course of the Guadiana to the Atlantic, and south to the other side of Algarve’s Barrocal region, where this militia was a remarkable owner of spiritual rights, particularly in Castro Marim, Cacela, Tavira, Faro, LoulÃ© and Albufeira. These areas, where the institution left its singular brand, show memories of a mythical past repeatedly invoked, on which the transformations of time were accumulated, particularly those that occurred in the course of about sixty years, when Portuguese art forms simultaneously used Tardo-Gothic, Manueline and Renaissance designs.\n\nCUSTÃDIO, Delmira Maria Rita Martins dos Santos Espada, Artistic relations between Portugal and Flanders through the Books of Hours preserved in Portugal, PhD in History of Art: Medieval Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Maria Adelaide Miranda, Bernardo Vasconcelos e Sousa and Dominique Vanwijnsberghe, 2017 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/27982)\n\nKeywords: Book of Hours; Flemish illuminated manuscripts; Portuguese illuminated manuscripts; Portuguese court; Burgundy\n\nAbstract: The central thesis of this work is to show the importance of the Book of Hours, in the context of the late medieval Portuguese society and the relations that involved it with the main European courts. This study has allowed to reconstitute the course of some codices, to evaluate the prestige that we gained in the main European courts, the great receptivity that the Flemish art found within the Portuguese nobility and the impact that it had on the national production. The absence of studies, for the great majority of the codices, led us to the elaboration of the exhaustive survey of the handwritten Books of Hours and loose folios that are currently preserved in Portugal, organized by institutions, plus sixteen other codices linked to the Portuguese court that belong to foreign entities and to which we also dedicate a very brief study. The seventy-eight specimens we pointed out in Portugal were the subject of an analytical study which included the identification of the origin and the iconographic programs (with indication of the section in which they are inserted) and the specific bibliography for each manuscript. The Books of Hours of Flemish origin, mostly from the Portuguese royal collection, were the object of a more detailed codicological study that included, in addition to the aspects mentioned before, the elaboration of developed scientific records, the complete transcription of the text and its confrontation with the coeval painting and illumination, with the patrimony of previous times and with the production of the subsequent generations, where we tried to evaluate its impact. From this study there were also significant innovations related to the codices under analysis, highlighting the reconstitution of what we consider to be the initial project of the so-called Book of Hours said to belong to Prince Ferdinand or Queen Catherine, and it is now expected that their visibility will position them in the center of the national and international discussion. By organizing them in chronologies and workshops, we intend to show the evolution of the pictorial language which marked the Flemish illuminations of the 15th and 16th centuries, and its contextualization in the contemporary production served to better understand the dynamics of book production, the circulation of models, the choices of the Portuguese elites and the greatness of the codices that we possess. The reconstitution of its institutional course and the partnerships developed with some institutions that have the codices allowed us to evaluate and understand damages inflicted in more recent times and reconstitute part of the history of the book.\n\nDAMÃSIO, LuÃ­s Fernando Pimenta de Castro, Amadeo's gallery.

Architecture is the artistic discipline which has been structuring the shrine whether through popular archetypes (Little Chapel of the Apparitions) whether through the most erudite projects that turned the shrine into a field including aesthetic movements, such as the art from the nineteenth century (basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary), the art of the twentieth century, in a first period related to the scenographic architecture of Estado Novo (esplanade and colonnade), and in a posterior stadium related to an art trying to find aesthetic solutions that assigned to the place a real international look, reflecting the tendencies of post-modernism. In the turn of the new century the architectonic discipline will continue to rule through the construction of the broadest church in Portugal, the Most Holy Trinity church. The plans and elevations of the new buildings have, also, required campaigns of artistic valorization which, mainly in some moments of the daily life of the Shrine, transformed the place into a laborious laboratory of art, facing with tenacity the difficult, however fundamental, epistemological debate on sacred art. In fact, notorious names of the artistic production from the 80’ and 90’ of the twentieth century have achieved artistic labours on painting, on sculpture or on stained glass. Always driven by the celebrative moments, the Shrine of FÃ¡tima gets to the threshold of the twenty first century with some more motives to the promotion of works of art: the Jubilee of the year 2000 and the beatification of the two seers of the apparitions. However, if this chronological marker has already brought some novelty in terms of work of art, it is the period of the 90 years since the apparitions of FÃ¡tima that distinguishes indelibly the landscape of the shrine, through the construction of the Most Holy Trinity church. This project had the ability to open a new phase in the life of that place without annihilating neither in the implantation, nor in the elevation, nor in the volume the constructive monumental tradition erected throughout nine decades. Alongside with the physical construction of the shrine, the artistic discipline has found in FÃ¡tima the favourable field in terms of iconographic creation, and once again depending on a reality in construction ‘ex nihilo’. Since one is dealing with creation from a new reality, the historian may classify the typologies of the Image of the Virgin of FÃ¡tima, from the “type” (the image created for the Little Chapel of the Apparitions as official figuration); the “archetype” (the image of Our Lady of Lapa, which inspired the great number of volumetric features of the sculpture), and the “subtypes” or new and subsidiary models (such as the posterior figurations of the Pilgrim Virgin and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in consequence of the iconic reflexion and of the revelation of the Message of FÃ¡tima itself). One may also add to these typologies various iconographic fusions, among those one can notice the presences and the absences of the Virgin of the Message of FÃ¡tima, valued in the different iconographic syncretism intrinsic to the them that derives from the episodes of FÃ¡tima, such as - although with different kinds of representation - the theme of Our Lady of Carmo, of Our Lady of Sorrows and of Our Lady in the context of the Holy Family, also valued in the iconographic syncretism from the derivation of senses, as it happens with the themes of the coronation of the Virgin of FÃ¡tima or of the Virgin of the Apocalypse. It still belongs to the iconography of FÃ¡tima the plastic fixation of themes such as the one of the Miracle of the Sun, the one of the Apparitions of Tuy and Pontevedra, the one of the Secret of FÃ¡tima, the iconographic fixation of the Shepherds seers itself, one wishing to pull them out from the pictures of 1917, and, among others, the aesthetic fixation of the image of the Angel of FÃ¡tima, whose artistic labour is going to find inspiration in the theme of the Guardian Angel of Portugal. With such a fertile ground and with the immeasurable impact of FÃ¡tima in the Christian world, and not only in it, it is no surprise that the worthiest artists look into the issue and that, with different levels of cultural acceptance, they sign works in the context of this theme. The Shrine - as a place of physical landscape built out from architectural, sculptural, pictorial and urbanistic elements, and also as a place of psychological landscape built out from pilgrims in ritual practises that fill in the esplanade with the light of the candles in the night vigils or with the white handkerchiefs during goodbye - claims itself as iconographic ‘topos’, unique recognized image, for various motives such as the artistic elements, in the whole globe.\n\nDUARTE, Miguel Nuno Mesquita, Image (of) Archive and Mnemonics Time: for a project of “Arquiviology” in the History of Art, PhD in History of Art: Contemporary Art History submitted to the School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, supervised by Margarida Medeiros and Ana Margarida Alves, 2016 (http://hdl.handle.net/10362/18800)\n\nKeywords: Archive; Time; Historiography; Photography; Cinema; Atlas\n\nAbstract: This st"
