It includes battles representing different chronologies and geographies, many of them not yet widely known to the international medieval studies community or to a wider general public but often highly resonant within particular national or local contexts. The aim of the series is to make more widely known European battles which may have had a strong national or regional importance, without them being or becoming a pan-European event. Battles are intrinsically related to the winning and losing side, and often the knowledge and importance of a battle stops at the periphery of the winners and losers, even if it originally had consequences beyond those. Often battles relate to or help define national identities thereby shaping Europe in the post-medieval world. English was chosen as language of choice for this series in order to reach out to the larg­ est possible audience. All the volumes provide an overview of the political context of the event, a detailed description of the combat, its reflections in the collective memory of each nation, the relevance of the battlefield and the battle at the present time, stressing different experiences visitors are expected to have in order to bring them closer to the respective historical epoch. The first volume is dedicated to the Battle of Aljubarrota, fought in central Portugal on August 14, 1385, between the newly elected King João I of Portugal and the Castilian monarch, Juan I of Trastâmara. In Portuguese history, this is viewed as the country’s most celebrated battle, having profound consequences with regard to the ultimate con­ figuration of the Iberian political world. In the first chapter, we begin by embedding the conflict in the context of Iberian relations during the fourteenth century, integrating it into the macro European conflict of the Hundred Years’ War. Through a comparative analysis between the European set­ ting and its Iberian reflections, particularly in Castile and Portugal, the aim is to lead the public to a better understanding of a complex process. We will show how the Battle of Aljubarrota, itself a decisive military and political moment, can be seen as the Iberian expression of the aforementioned late medieval Anglo-French conflict. Between chapters two and five, the contents will be exclusively devoted to the description of the battle, including a presentation of the archaeological remains, and an analysis of the different material and literary sources. Through a detailed description of the event (the itinerary of the forces involved, tactics adopted, weapons, etc.) we aim to prove how this battlefield presents a wonderful example for the study of medieval military history. Chapters six and seven will present the way the battle was handled later in both historiographical and literary terms, particularly the mythical dimension of the event. From this perspective, Aljubarrota and its heroes turned out to have an exemplary value whenever the Portuguese felt their own independence threatened. For example, the battle was remembered in various political and social manifestations during the period of the Austrian Monarchy (1580–1640) and it remained very much alive in the eyes of future generations.\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nFinally, in chapter 8, this book concludes by showing the possibilities for engage­ ment that exist today on-site, which attractively convey the experience of a medieval conflict, acting as an effective way to preserve public memory. Indeed, the Aljubarrota Foundation aims to offer a museum setting complemented by many other visitor experi­ ences through an Interpretation Centre dedicated to this important battle, welcoming visitors of all ages, and giving them privileged insights into the history of these events, the involvement of all its protagonists and their role in the construction of the identity of Portugal. A select bibliography is provided at the end. Works found in this bibliography but which are cited in footnotes are always given in shortened form in the latter. While the major­ ity of research has been undertaken and published in Portuguese, we have attempted to include as much relevant material from English and French-language publications as pos­ sible. Nonetheless we hope that this volume will encourage more international research­ ers to study this battle and to profit from a visit to the actual battlefield site. The editors\n\nChapter 1\n\nBEFORE ALJUBARROTA LUÍS ADÃO DA FONSECA and MARIA CRISTINA PIMENTA\n\nThe primary objective of this chapter is to consider the national and interna­ tional context surrounding the Battle of Aljubarrota (August 14, 1385). This subject has been addressed by various Portuguese and international historians, albeit in a some­ what oblique manner, both with regard to reflections on the actual battle as well as the period in which it occurred.1 As one of the most researched and heavily discussed topics in Portuguese history, we believe it is interesting to reconsider this issue and enquire as to what extent Portugal’s relationship with the other kingdoms of Europe in the four­ teenth century allows us to place the Portuguese National Crisis of 1383–13852 and, even more so, its military expression in Aljubarrota, within the wider context of what has been called the Hundred Years’ War. The Historical Context\n\nThe final decades of the fourteenth century were troubled, with a profound demo­ graphic and economic crisis that affected Western Europe after approximately three centuries of continuous growth following the “millennium.” Food supplies were prob­ lematic: insufficient agricultural crop yields from 1314 to 1317 were recorded in a large part of Western Europe, where agricultural activity was the main engine of the economy. At the same time, social tensions intensified and were often directed towards those who held or represented authority, whether bishop, lord, or officer of the king. As a result, weak physical resistance meant populations were susceptible to systematic outbreaks of epidemics, notably the mid-century Black Death. This was an endemic disease which, from sources available, arrived in Europe by sea through Genoese merchants with eco­\n\n1 In addition to studies cited in the Select Bibliography (under Arnaut, Coelho, Duarte, Monteiro, Russell, and Suarez Fernandez), other key works in Portuguese include Saúl António Gomes, A Batalha Real. 14 de Agosto de 1385 (Lisbon: Fundação Batalha de Aljubarrota, 2007); João Gouveia Monteiro, A Guerra em Portugal nos finais da Idade Média (Lisbon: Notí�cias, 1998); and Peter Russell, “Galés portuguesas ao serviço de Ricardo de Inglaterra (1385–89),” Revista da Faculdade de Letras de Lisboa 18 (1953): 61–73 (reprinted in the Variorum series, Portugal, Spain and the African Atlantic: 1343–1490 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1995)). This chapter builds on two crucial earlier studies: Luí�s Adão da Fonseca, O essencial sobre o Tratado de Windsor and “Significado da Batalha de Aljubarrota no contexto da conjuntura polí�tica europeia no último quartel do séc. XIV,” in A guerra e a sociedade na Idade Média, VI Jornadas Luso– Espanholas de Estudos Medievais, ed. M. Helena C. Coelho, Saul Gomes and António M. Rebelo, 2 vols. (Coimbra: Sociedade portuguesa de estudos medievais, 2009), 1:57–74.\n\n2 This is the title of a publication by Marcelo Caetano (A Crise Nacional de 1383–1385. Subsídios para o seu estudo (Lisbon: Verbo, 1985)), and it became synonymous with the events in 1383–1385 in modern Portuguese historiography.\n\n2\n\n�����������������������������������������������\n\nnomic interests in the Crimean Peninsula. Almost all of Europe was seriously hit by this disease, but it is difficult to get definitive figures on the overall death-rate.3 This led to depopulation, an aspect that would eventually become one of the main obstacles to economic recovery, and loss of faith in the Church in the face of such human decima­ tion, some seeing it as punishment from God. This opened the door to spiritual disorder embodied in either rigorous morality or a turn to heresy. In Portugal, manifestations of these broader phenomena were felt in many aspects of social life and strongly influenced the framework of political action in the fifteenth century. The most well-known measures to decrease the effects of this crisis were intro­ duced in Portugal by King Afonso IV (1325–1357). Arguably, most influential was a law called Pragmática, by which the monarch limited each social category to what they were allowed to spend, and at the same time, regulated labour in the fields and taxation on wages.4 These and other measures5 were far from easy to achieve and his successor, King Pedro I, was to follow his father’s steps trying to preserve at least some social equi­ librium.6 These general crises naturally had an effect on politics. Portugal was involved in many events within a broader western European sphere prior aside from those directly leading to the armies of King Juan I of Castile and the armies of King João I of Portugal coming to face each other on the battlefield at Aljubarrota. What happened before that afternoon in August 1385, a military episode of unquestionable historical importance, must be seen in the context of how Europe was structurally aligned and how this align­ ment was reflected in Portugal. Because this battle triggered a serious crisis which affected political relationships across the Iberian Peninsula, it is important to present it within this broader European context. Indeed, let us consider these words written relatively recently: It is essential to consider the two major warlike systems in this period of European his­ tory, perfectly differentiated in chronological terms, and both fully obedient to autono­ mous political–military issues. In this order of ideas, what is in question in the period which interests us—the second half of the fourteenth century—is of course the first cycle of wars, which took place between 1336 and 1388, which nowadays is classified as the Crécy military system.7\n\n3 One estimate puts the overall figure at around one-third of the population of Europe at the time.

See Livro das Leis e Posturas, ed. by Maria Teresa Campos Rodrigues (Lisbon: Faculdade de Direito, 1971), 448–51. 5 One of the last syntheses on this policy can be read in Coelho, D. João I, 22; Bernardo Vasconcelos e Sousa, “Idade Média (Séculos XI–XV),” in História de Portugal, ed.

Pedro I, 90–150.\n\n7 Fonseca, “Significado da Batalha de Aljubarrota,” 61n22, contains essential references to understanding this process, such as Alfred H. Burne, The Crecy War: A Military History of the Hundred Years War from 1337 to the Peace of Bretigny, 1360 (London: Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1955).\n\nBefore Aljubarrota\n\n3\n\nThe unfolding of events from 1336 onwards in France, when the War of Flanders started—the first of the aforementioned wars—immediately led to a reordering of political forces in Western Europe. The Iberian Peninsula could not remain indifferent to what was happening, since it directly affected the control of the area from the English Channel to the Cantabrian Sea. Given the connections this area provided with the Baltic and with the Mediterranean, this first phase of the Hundred Years’ War also implied a struggle for the control of maritime communications within the area of the “first Atlan­ tic,” extending along the western coasts of Europe. At that time in Portugal, a century had passed since the end of the Reconquista (the conquest of Faro in the Algarve having taken place in 1249), and the continental borders with Castile had been set down in the well-known treaty of Alcanices (1279). Given this, the kingdom and its political leaders were fully aware of the need to define a maritime policy, which was initiated by extending the traditional historiographical interpretation of Reconquista; that is, being an attempt to divert turmoil within the country by wag­ ing war outside the borders of the kingdom. In other words, a new strategic frontier was being defined, by moving from the mainland to the sea, a place where maritime war and corsairs would take on a crucial dimension. Naturally, the diplomatic implica­ tions this political strategy involved were clear: as regards Castile, the defence of Portu­ guese interests would imply the preservation of a dual border (on the one hand, the land border and, on the other, a strategic border defending commercial and military routes which extended beyond the former). Being able to respond to this challenge obviously conditioned to a great extent—if not all of—the political actions of the Portuguese mon­ archy at that time. Within the broader west European context of countries taking sides in the Hun­ dred Years’ War, the Avignon Papacy and suchlike, Portugal had initially kept apart, but this was no longer possible after 1346, the year of the French defeat at Crécy. During the 1340s, Portuguese diplomacy was played out on various levels which were contra­ dictory in their implications. On the one hand, it was important not to lose friendship with Castile but, on the other hand, it had to align with English positions (who were at that moment in the ascendant), since without their support it would have been dif­ ficult for the Portuguese to access markets and ports in the North. Clear examples of this binary approach of Portugal towards England and Castile can be illustrated, respectively, through the matrimonial policy of the Portuguese monarchy which had a pro-English orientation,8 or through the signing of a Luso–English trade treaty in 13539 and another peace treaty in 1358 between Pedro I of Portugal and the King of Castile, which envis­\n\n8 In 1345, an English betrothal with one of the daughters of King Afonso IV was negotiated (see V. M. Shillington and A. B. Chapman, The Commercial Relations of England and Portugal (London: Routledge, 1907), 7–8) and, in 1347, Leonor of Portugal married Pedro IV of Aragon, a marriage that clearly took place following the diplomatic contacts between England and the peninsular kingdoms, dating back to the start of 1344 (see Bernardo Vasconcelos e Sousa, D.

While it is true that this marriage did not take place, this rapprochement between the crowns would last until at least 1362.10 Upon his accession to the throne, following the death of his father on January 18, 1357,11 Fernando inherited a diplomatic balance between the aforementioned king­ doms. Portugal was being led by circumstances beyond its borders, following the 1360 Treaty of Brétigny which, at least for a few years, interrupted the rising losses caused by the great conflict. Even so, from the perspective of Portuguese interests, this balanc­ ing act did not solve every problem. If a civil war were rekindled in Castile (with its knock-on consequences in the alignment of positions on the European stage) its con­ sequences would be felt in Portugal at the highest level. Peter Russell, in a well-known work, emphasized precisely this aspect when calling attention to the diplomatic mission sent by the Portuguese monarch Pedro I to England intending to apologize for what the King of Castile had said.12 This mission was led by the Bishop of É� vora and Gomes Lou­ renço do Avelar. They travelled to Gascony to meet the Prince of Wales and report the comments made by Pedro I of Castile on the bad reception that he and his daughters had received in 1366 in Portugal from his uncle, King Pedro I. This tightrope stance with England by the king of Portugal could not continue once he died in 1367. After 1367 diplomacy became more intricate when the crowns of Castile and France, now also united at a military level, were able to turn the military tide with England. Indeed, the collaboration of the Castilian navy meant that France, defeated at Crécy, gained political strength. With the English defeat at La Rochelle, in 1372, the domina­ tion of Castilian ships in the Atlantic had become more significant.13 In this scenario, it is easier to understand the commercial policy advocated by the Portuguese maritime cit­ ies in the second half of the fourteenth century. The opportunity of Portugal to maintain privileged access to the South Atlantic became a top priority in political and diplomatic relations concerning the Castilian, Basque, or Andalusian routes, inasmuch as the fleets of Castile were directly competing here. The fact that Portuguese vessels had access to the Atlantic under an alliance with Castile would ultimately limit Lusitanian seafaring; in the long run, it would provide a fatal blow to Portuguese foreign business relationships. Given this situation, and the geographical location of the kingdom of Portugal, it was not very feasible to maintain autonomous Portuguese trade in the Atlantic. So, the pres­ ervation of maritime freedom—the priority of Portuguese foreign policy at the time— had been definitely compromised by the actions of the main adversaries in the Hundred Years’ War, and Portugal had no way of turning conditions in its favour. The international situation remained extremely fluid, and King Fernando of Portugal found himself with limited options. After the assassination of Pedro I the Cruel of Castile at the hands of his brother Enrique of Trastâmara in 1369, the Portuguese king was\n\n10 Chancelaria de D. Pedro I, ed. A. H.

In order to do so, King Fer­ nando began by assuming a clearly Anglophile position, convinced that he could obtain benefits within the Peninsula by organizing a series of military interventions in the neighbouring territory.14 However, the rapid turn of the European conflict in favour of the Franco-Castilian bloc obliged the King of Portugal to take a different stance, through the Luso–Castilian treaty of March 1371, signed at Alcoutim, and the promise to marry Leonor, daughter of Enrique II of Trastâmara, the King of Castile.15 Since this marriage did not in the end occur, we can see how the variety of matrimonial negotiations by the King of Portugal are only understood within the international chess-game taking place at the time. When, in May 1372, Fernando decided to suddenly marry a Portuguese noble­ woman, Leonor Teles,16 that meant—in terms of foreign Portuguese policy—refusing to make any political decision that would imply a definitive European alignment. A differ­ ent option (such as marrying a princess from Aragon or one from Castile, as had been decided in Alcoutim)17 would certainly have required forming alliances which sooner or later would have compromised the position of Portugal within the framework of the Hundred Years’ War. That is why “the marriage of Fernando to Leonor Teles was, for all intents and purposes, a clear move with the future in mind.[…] By paying the lowest possible cost, Fernando could not do anything else but negotiate the freedom of naviga­ tion for Lusitanian trade with the Lords of the Atlantic.”18 In so doing, Portugal avoided a unilateral foreign policy, perhaps in a brilliant manner, to ensure to keep doors open for future commitments either with the Peninsular kingdoms or with France or England.19 Political options were further restricted once international political alignments took on a new, religious dimension. This happened in 1378 when Christendom became divided between two popes. After Pope Gregory XII decided to leave the French city of Avignon and return to Rome, a crisis emerged upon his death. As expected, his succes­ 14 Lopes, Crónica de D. Fernando, chap. 25 at 87–89 and chap. 28, 97–98 (Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional / Casa da Moeda, 1975). Cf. Rita Costa Gomes, D.

This dispute led to Clement VII settling in Avignon and Urban VI in Rome, each with different supporters. Portugal took the side of Urban VI, along with, among others, Eng­ land, while France and Castile opted for Clement VII.20 To safeguard navigation in the Atlantic (important to leading members of society as well as having an economic dimen­ sion), the Portuguese Crown faced another dilemma which meant it would not always be possible to act in a totally independent manner. Developments in the war meant Por­ tugal might have to negotiate the circulation of Portuguese boats in the Atlantic with the Castilians as well as seeking an urgent renewal of the alliance with England. This explains two apparently contradictory matrimonial negotiations: on Portuguese ini­ tiative marriage was agreed upon between the Portuguese and Castilian heirs on May 21, 1380,21 and, days later, Richard II of England gave João Fernandes Andeiro, Count of Ourém, authorization to enter into an alliance with Portugal, which was signed on July 15 and led to the negotiation of the marriage of Beatriz to the son of the Earl of Cam­ bridge.22 The outcome would eventually result in a definite rapprochement between Portugal and Castile, especially when the Earl of Cambridge led an expedition to Portu­ gal, partly on Portuguese instigation but a failure.23 For the Castilians, this news was received with considerable concern, and they decided to assemble an armada with the aim of blocking the Portuguese coast.24 As an interesting detail, it should be noted that the English involved in this expedition, when returning to England in September 1382, were transported in Castilian ships.25. Indeed, the power of Castile to dominate the path of the Atlantic routes seemed unquestionable. For the Portuguese monarch, it was time to opt for the most advanta­ geous solution for the country’s economy and, perhaps, one that would most satisfy the interests of Portuguese society. A new Luso–Castilian peace agreement was therefore signed in Elvas in August 1382. Beatriz—once again—was now promised to Fernando de Antequera, the Castilian prince who would later become king of Aragon. In these circumstances, it is not difficult to understand the decision of King Fer­ nando to cast aside a commitment to England in favour of a pro-Castilian alignment. The monarch clearly understood that Portugal could only navigate in the Atlantic if it was fully integrated within the area of Castilian influence. This required the Portuguese 20 An interesting publication on this topic can be read in Doctrinas y relaciones de poder en el Cisma de Occidente y en la época conciliar (1378–1449), ed.

We believe it is within this context that when Juan I of Castile suddenly became a widower in September 1382, and despite the various marriage proposals he received, the Portuguese princess Beatriz was chosen to be his new queen.26 No attempt was made to prevent this marriage by the Portuguese—on the contrary in fact. There was a certain consensus in favour of this solution, perhaps because at that moment it repre­ sented the only way to maintain peace in the Iberian Peninsula. In fact, the widowhood of the King of Castile himself, [...] completely changed the course of Beatriz’s life. This was the fifth and definitive marriage option, which can be considered in part as a derivation from the previous ones, since many aspects of the bond had already been accepted. But only in part, because the major difference that separated Juan I from his son Fernando was the condition of the new pretender: it was not the same thing to marry Beatriz to the king of Castile as to his second son.27\n\nAs a result, after years of a fraught relationship between the Portuguese and Castilian thrones, King Fernando agreed to sign treaties at Pinto (December, 1382) and Salvaterra de Magos (April, 1383) as proof of a new détente.28 By the latter treaty, King Fernando’s only daughter, Beatriz, would marry the king of Castile, Juan I, at Badajoz. However, the Portuguese king died in October of that same year, and the regency of the kingdom was handed over to his widow, Leonor Teles. While the kingdom was unsettled by a lack of clarity in the line of succession, the queen, for personal and political reasons, embarked on a delicate path along which she undertook a precipitous defence of her daughter’s rights, leading to a major schism in Portuguese society. In a very short period of time, these divisions came to light and opposition to the regent became a reality.\n\nCastile Turns from Friend to Enemy, 1383–1384\n\nWithout some awareness of this background it is difficult to understand the unfold­ ing of events which followed, and those that were perhaps the most decisive for what happened on August 14, 1385 on the fields of Aljubarrota. The main question to be answered is, thus, why and how did a Luso–Castilian alliance mutate in barely two years into a battle between the two crowns? One of the factors was, as we have seen, Portugal’s need to ensure a relatively inde­ pendent political, diplomatic, economic, and maritime area for itself and this required a good relationship with England. The Anglophile party had support from the bourgeoisie of the coastal cities, perfectly aware that an alliance with Castile would mean it would 26 Lopes, Crónica de D.

The aris­ tocracy was divided: some accepted Castilian friendship (represented in the marriage of Beatriz to Juan I); others argued for a national solution, involving the accession to the throne of Pedro I and Inês de Castro’s sons, João and Dinis.30 They both were progeny of a complicated relationship between Prince Pedro (then not yet king of Portugal) and a Galician noble woman, Inês, whose family was highly regarded in the peninsular politi­ cal scenario of the period. Their two Infantes were living in Castile and, as soon as the succession problem arose in Portugal, Juan I of Castile ordered João to be arrested (as he was the eldest brother and the one who would be summoned to reign in Portugal).31 The events which preceded the Battle of Aljubarrota may be explained by the interplay in this complex framework. With the death of the king of Portugal, Fernando I, in 1383, and with his only daugh­ ter, Beatriz, being married to Juan I of Castile, a considerable number of influential Por­ tuguese dignitaries swore immediately after this marriage “covenants and reciprocal assurances in relation to the Portuguese succession,”32 in the treaty of Salvaterra de Magos. According to this treaty, the Portuguese throne should subsequently pass to an eventual child of Juan and Beatriz (or, in the absence of children, the regency should 29 Russell, A Intervenção Inglesa, 226–27, 231–32 and 386–89.\n\n30 See, for example, Arnaut, A crise nacional dos fins do século XIV, 166–69 and 173ff. 31 Pimenta, D.

And so we might ask why was it not possible, in political terms, to follow what was stipulated in that treaty? The question is impor­ tant because the military confrontation at Aljubarrota resulted from the treaty not being capable of being implemented for political reasons. Leonor Teles, then regent and governess of the kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve, received precise instructions from her daughter and son-in-law for Portugal to issue proclamations acclaiming Beatriz as queen of Portugal. A sharpening of social tensions based on the rapid enthronement of Juan I and Beatriz was to be expected. Nevertheless, as we have seen, there were alternatives who could have succeeded Fernando: the Infantes João and Dinis and also another João, master of the religious-military Order of Avis, likewise son of the same king Pedro I. Portugal faced no easy options: opinions were polarized, pressure came from vari­ ous sources with different levels of intensity, and events ran out of control. Opposition to the regent, led by the maritime cities—with Lisbon at the forefront, already in the pro­ cess of economic recovery after a long period of crisis—took to the streets, and events followed each other at breakneck speed.33 It is worth recalling that Leonor Teles, under 33 An extensive appreciation of this important period of Portuguese history can be read in Campos, Leonor Teles, uma mulher de poder?, 136ff.\n\n10\n\n�����������������������������������������������\n\nthe terms of the Treaty of Salvaterra de Magos was entitled, as regent of the realm, to make important decisions, such as appointing mayors and other officials, convening the Cortes, and suchlike.34 That was certainly not popular among the Portuguese. It was not surprising, then, that the Count of Ourém (believed to be the queen’s lover and a known agent of foreign interests) was assassinated (in December 1383), and the Infante João, having taken refuge in Castile, became, as we have mentioned, the “national” alterna­ tive (which explains his immediate imprisonment in Castile) and the perfect figure to lead the opposition to Leonor Teles. Nevertheless, as he was not then in Portugal, it was the Master of Avis, his half-brother, who, in the beginning, acted as his representative. Shortly after, he accepted becoming defender of the kingdom in his own name. As a result, within a few months, a climate of civil war had spread over the whole kingdom which, in the words of Fernão Lopes led to a “strong and deadly war seeing some Portuguese individuals wishing to destroy others, and those born from the womb and brought up by the land wish to kill themselves willingly and sprinkle the blood of their parents and relatives!”35 The main currents of opinion and the corresponding Portuguese pressure groups were divided as to a response to this crisis. The Anglophile party found fulsome sup­ port in the bourgeoisie and the maritime cities. But the aristocracy was divided. Some accepted Castilian friendship, which, through the marriage of Beatriz to Juan I of Castile, contained uncertain guarantees regarding Portugal’s independence; others argued for a “national solution” by continuing the royal lineage through Inês de Castro’s heirs. Vari­ ous factors underlay preferences for one or other of the two options within the nobility. For example, some noblemen were constrained by internal issues within aristocratic families (resulting from inheritance problems), or economic interests of various forms, such as Portuguese landowning overlapping with Castilian territory, among others. For the upper Portuguese nobility, a Castilian solution probably seemed an attractive model. Further study is needed on this point. In addition, there were destabilizing elements of various types, including the emperegilados group (immigrants in favour of the former King Pedro I of Castile who died in 1369 and who were opposed to the successor Trastâ­ maran dynasty), which, through controlling some key positions, acted unreliably, oscil­ lating between a positive attitude towards England and a hazy attitude towards Castile. Simple explanations which divide groups into “patriots” and “traitors” do not work. The seriousness and complexity of the problems, the major internal and external impli­ cations of the options at play, and the interplay of many familial, economic, and even strategic factors, suggest we should be prudent in our judgements. Western Europe, in general, and the Iberian Peninsula, in particular, faced, in the 1380s, a delicate situa­\n\n34 All these decisions were of crucial significance, especially the convening of the Cortes. First known in Portugal since 1254 in Leiria, the Cortes were reunions where representatives of cities and urban communities gathered, at the request of the king (for the majority of occasions). Best seen therefore as representative assemblies (Armindo de Sousa, As cortes medievais portuguesas (1385–1490) (Porto: Instituto Nacional de Investigação Cientí�fica, 1990), 48), they dealt essentially with finance, the signature and ratification of treaties, setting prices, taxation, and, as happened in Coimbra, 1385, with the choice of the future king of Portugal. 35 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Primeira, chap. 68, 116.\n\nBefore Aljubarrota\n\n11\n\ntion in which the rupture of the balance between the traditional powers was expressed in the difficulty of achieving new political and diplomatic outcomes which successfully replaced previous, but ineffective, ones. And everything had an effect on foreign rela­ tions. Thus, without fear of exaggeration, it may be said that different futures for Portu­ guese society were at stake. These implications, of which the protagonists on both sides were perfectly aware, transformed a difficult problem of a dynastic succession into an open conflict, creating the civil war to which we have already referred. The person ultimately responsible for this process was the Master of the Order of Avis, João, chosen as “Regent and Defender of the Kingdom.” On December 6, 1383, as a consequence of a violent encounter with the Count of Ourém (someone very close to the widowed queen, Leonor Teles), he took the first major step in defining what would then take place. This decision can be considered as precipitous, with totally unpredictable consequences, with the Master assuming full political responsibility, having to deal with the inevitable military attack led by the King of Castile, who entered Portugal that same month, ready to reclaim the throne. Indeed, that December, Juan I of Castile invaded via the region of Guarda, laying siege to Coimbra, and then headed for Santarém, to meet Leonor Teles, his mother-in-law. The ease with which the Castilian monarch was able to do this is explained by the chronicler Fernão Lopes, who wrote: “It is fitting that we should speak of the places which listened to and obeyed him, to see how he had much of the kingdom under his control.” However, he added an important rider: “Notwithstand­ ing that the people dwelling in those places obeyed him not through their own will, but the mayors […] listened to his words and forced the commoners to obey.”36 As a result, the widowed queen, under pressure from the king of Castile and in total disagreement with the provisions contained in the aforementioned Treaty of Salvaterra de Magos, ceded the regency of the kingdom to her son-in-law.37 She was thus removed from this “new” political scene and imprisoned in the monastery of Tordesillas.38 As rightly pointed out by Olivera Serrano, Juan I of Castile used this opportunity as justifica­ tion for people in Portugal to understand that “the revolt against the tyrant and his wife was fully justified.”39 After this episode, the possibility of war now loomed and the Master of Avis had to quickly rethink his strategy and activate precautionary measures which he had established a few months previously. Examples were the appointment of Nuno Á� lvares 36 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Primeira, chap. 68, 116.\n\n37 Juan I swiftly “ordered the coining of money in Santarém, collected the jewels which Leonor had inherited from King Fernando, and received a service worth 30,000 pounds from the good men of the district” (Coelho, D. João I, 43).\n\n38 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Primeira, chap. 84, 141–42. The points of view of the widowed queen, which have generated some disagreement among Portuguese historians, can nowadays be assessed in detail.

While it is true that this first approach by the Master to the English crown did not lead to immediate success for Portuguese diplomacy, the commitment of the future King of Portugal to a Luso–English alliance would eventually bear its desired outcome.40 In spring, 1384, making use of the resources still at his disposal, and at the head of an army of fifteen hundred men, Nuno Á� lvares Pereira blocked the Castilian advance at Atoleiros, near Fronteira, a region where the Order of Avis was in charge of the local government.41 As João Gouveia Monteiro described: It was in Fronteira that Nun’Á�lvares slept on that night of 6 April, surely relishing his first great military victory. Of course this seems to have been facilitated by the poor perfor­ mance of the adversary, who did not properly reconnoitre the terrain, and which erred in not using its archers (who could have been very useful during the initial stage of the combat to break up the Portuguese formation and put it into disarray), its light cavalry and infantry soldiers, betting everything on a cavalry charge which took place on soaked land and an unfavourable slope. The Castilian chancellor himself [Lopez de Ayala] recog­ nized the disastrous hastiness: “[…] and due to bad ordinance they were foiled.” But this should not detract from the merit of the tactical model drawn up by the winning army. This is because from the outset they dared to take the initiative in the combat and were able to attract the other army to a terrain that was clearly favourable to them. Secondly, because they were able to adapt their resources to the battlefield, making full use of the capacity and effect of their crossbowmen and the slingers, which proved to be an abso­ lutely decisive factor in slowing down and disorganizing the powerful Castilian heavy cavalry charge. Thirdly, in opting for combat fought completely on foot, Nun’Á�lvares’s risk was rewarded: it balanced the fortunes of the men involved and their chances of survival, and in so doing removed an important psychological effect, mainly for those less used to fighting and who, with unmounted armed men at their side, received a moral boost which must have raised their confidence considerably.42\n\nHowever, in spite of this defeat, the king of Castile advanced on Lisbon on May 26, 1384, with a fleet of forty ships and thirteen galleys.43 Juan I of Castile set up his troops (on land and at sea) in an ostentatious manner with a group of men that the chronicler Fernão Lopes described as being: “five thousand lancers […] and one thousand light cavalrymen […] and many good crossbowmen who were at least six thousand […] and many foot sol­ 40 However, it was only in July 1384 that Richard II of England gave a positive response to the two emissaries, Fernando Afonso de Albuquerque, Master of the Military Order of Santiago, and to the Chancellor Lourenço Anes Fogaça, in terms of authorizing the cooperation of English troops on the side of the Master of Avis.

Miguel Gomes Martins listed some of the measures taken, namely the following:45\n\n–– Tax advantages for those selling food in Lisbon, a measure with little success,\n\ngiven that the main cities (Óbidos, Torres Vedras, Sintra, Cascais, Alenquer, and Santarém) were in favour of Beatriz, which made the movement of goods and individuals difficult.\n\n–– Forced requisition of goods. –– The sending of boats and skiffs to the Ribatejo region which brought back dead cattle for salting.\n\n–– Nuno Álvares Pereira leaving for Sintra on February 6, 1384 with three hundred lancers to collect supplies.\n\n–– A successful attempt to capture six Castilian vessels with supplies.\n\nIncidentally, since the 1370s, King Fernando, already having encountered several prob­ lems with Castile,46 had had a new wall built around Lisbon. As Martins wrote, “it was precisely the fact that the city was well protected by this new structure which enabled it to successfully resist the siege of the besieging armies in 1384.”47 In addition, a barbican of more than three hundred metres was constructed and action was taken to “reinforce the more than seventy towers with wooden pergolas well supplied with arms,” besides ensuring a thorough check of the “heights of the wall.”48 For João Gouveia Monteiro: “As for the more than thirty doors and gates of the city, twelve remained open during the day, and were controlled by men of arms who slept at their posts.”49 Despite all these precautions the Castilians retained the upper hand. At sea, Portu­ gal only had one fleet, arriving from Porto, of seventeen ships and seventeen galleys. They clashed on July 18, with the Portuguese losing three ships. They passed the enemy blockade, but they were rapidly surrounded by the Castilian fleet: “our fleet was like the city: surrounded.”50 Controlling Lisbon in a situation like this would dictate the outcome. And indeed, despite various unsuccessful attempted solutions, nothing seemed to work. 44 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Primeira, chap. 114, 192.\n\n45 Miguel Gomes Martins, “Abastecer as cidades em contexto de guerra,” in Alimentar la ciudad en la Edad Media, ed.

This brought most of Portuguese society behind the Master of Avis. His formal recognition as king of Portugal took place at the Cortes of Coimbra, which met on April 6, 1385.\n\nThe Cortes of Coimbra, 1385: The Master of Avis Becomes King João I\n\nPortuguese historians have always devoted great attention to the study of these Cortes51 since, following the arguments of the distinguished man of law, João das Regras, the Master of Avis became legally able to accede as king of Portugal, the first monarch in the new dynasty of Avis. At the outset of the Cortes, when considering the actions and commitments made by the soon to be king João I, no other outcome might be expected. However, the matter was and always has been complex and deserves thorough exami­ nation. When the Cortes assembled the throne was not vacant insofar as “there being not one, but many” possible heirs.52 More precisely, four: Beatriz (for all intents and pur­ poses, queen of Portugal), the Infantes João and Dinis (children of King Pedro I), and the Master of Avis, also son of the same king. The speech made by João das Regras would try to reverse this situation, proving that none of the candidates was a legitimate heir, as Maria Helena Coelho has explained in detail.53 João das Regras alleged that the Infantes João and Dinis, sons of Inês de Castro and King Pedro I, had been born without their parents being married; that João, Master of Avis, was the fruit of an extra-marital relationship of the same king with Teresa Lou­ renço, and that Beatriz (daughter of King Fernando and Leonor Teles) had also been an illegitimate child since the mother became wife of the king of Portugal while still married to João Lourenço da Cunha. These circumstances, with a vacant throne and all the candidates having been reduced to the status of bastards, opened the path for the Master of Avis to be listed as a bastard, certainly, but of all four the best choice. He argued that the Master of Avis had been present at the most critical moments of Portugal in the last few years. When he agreed to become the “Regent and Defender of the Kingdom” he had acted, not for his benefit and fame, but always in the name of his elder brother, João. Moreover, the various military episodes in which Beatriz (through the actions of her husband, Juan I of Castile) had raised arms against Portugal, and her closeness to the Church of Avignon, made the oratorical task of João das Regras easier when presenting the arguments favouring the Master of Avis.54 Let us not forget too the presence of Nuno Á� lvares Pereira at the Cortes of Coimbra; from the outset he radically and vehemently expressed his support for the cause of the 51 Caetano, História do Direito; Sousa, As cortes medievais portuguesas; Coelho, D.

This was an intimidating factor of some weight, along with the political and legal arguments presented by others.55 It has been rightly observed that “this decisive change of political power was due to the continued pressure of Nuno Á� lvares on the noble­ men, often with insinuations concerning the possible use of arms, and the considerable knowledge and legal and oratorical mastery of João das Regras. Two strong men, two cornerstones, of the Master and King of Avis, who complemented each other.”56 Perhaps unsurprisingly, João was duly elected king of Portugal. At the time, he was also bound by his vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience as Master of the Order of Avis; however, he sought papal dispensation and on February 2, 1387 he married Philippa of Lancaster.57 55 Coelho, D.

This reflected Portugal’s foreign trade interests in the second half of the fourteenth century.59 With the closing of the Cortes of Coimbra, which politically legitimized a new king for Portugal, it would be expected that 1385—“the year of all decisions”60—forced the Cas­ tilians to respond. One would not have presumed any less from Juan I and Beatriz, his wife who, being in Castile, could not have averted the Cortes’ decision. Expecting some response, now as King of Portugal, João I and his Constable Nuno Á� lvares Pereira set about reorganizing their position in those northern Portuguese cities that had shown themselves sympathetic to Beatriz, bringing Neiva, Viana, Caminha, Vila Nova de Cer­ veira, Monção, Guimarães, Braga, and Ponte de Lima under their command.61 The Castilians started a new series of attacks, simultaneously on various fronts: launching a fleet off Lisbon, crossing the border near Elvas (which the monarch himself besieged), and sending noblemen who entered central Portugal in the region of the Bei­ ras, as a prelude to the Battle of Trancoso on May 29, 1385.62\n\nSequeira,” Militarium Ordinum Analecta 1 (1997): 178–80. This marriage was another step in the dynastic ambitions of John of Gaunt, begun the moment when he, some years before (in 1371), married Constance, daughter of the late king Pedro I of Castile. Due to this marriage, he became directly involved in Castilian politics, seeking to ascend the throne. Despite never achieving this objective, the founder of the House of Lancaster maintained a continuing interest in the Iberian Peninsula, especially expressed in the support given to D. João, Master of Avis.

See Fonseca, O essencial sobre o Tratado de Windsor, where it is stated: “In 1386, Portugal defines four great coordinates for its foreign policy: proclaims to defend the freedom of sea routes; defines the Channel as its northern strategic frontier (just as, by the beginning of the fourteenth century, it had defined Gibraltar as its southern strategic frontier); and enters the fifteenth century with a pro-English alignment, and, consequently, anti-Castilian.” 60 Barbosa and Gouveia, A Batalha de Trancoso, 9.\n\n61 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Segunda, chaps. 5 to 16, 12–31.

The House of Avis was born in fragility and the secret of its incomparably successful popularity can be found within this very fragility. Among many examples to justify this statement, Aljubarrota turned a kingdom still seen as a tasty meal to satisfy the King of Castile’s hunger into a great victorious afternoon that would, in various ways, presage future glories of the Portuguese. At Aljubarrota, both warring parties played all their trump cards. The Castilians asserted justification through the wishes of a Portuguese queen married in Castile denied the opportunity of expressing her prerogatives at the Cortes of Coimbra and also the possibility of a future heir one day governing both crowns. But also Castile was launching an offensive against the entente reached between Portugal and England, of which the marriage of the new monarch to a member of the House of Lancaster was but the most explicit expression of a broad plan involving political and economic col­ laboration. On the Portuguese side, besides the obvious need to defend its territory, throne, and people, it was also essential to channel a combination of national forces in this battle who, when faced with the enemy, would understand the need to unite around a single cause, a feeling which had not been possible to entirely establish at the Cortes of Coimbra, when people were still divided. Therefore, on this field of battle, the kingdom was making peace with itself, expressing its allegiance to João I. What happened will be the theme of the following chapters.\n\nChapter 2\n\nFIGHTING A BATTLE IN THE MIDDLE AGES JOÃO GOUVEIA MONTEIRO\n\nOn April 6, 1385, João, Master of Avis, was crowned as the tenth Portuguese mon­\n\narch, therefore giving rise to a second (and brilliant) dynasty. At the same time, the legal advisor João das Regras was appointed Chancellor and Nuno Á� lvares Pereira was chosen to be the Constable of the kingdom.1 At the same time, a loan of £400,000 was granted by the Cortes to the hero who had saved Lisbon from the Castilian conquest, since it was clear that the war was far from over. With his legitimacy greatly reinforced by the election held in Coimbra, João I then advanced northwards, and alongside his Constable, he took a series of garrisons in the district of Minho, which stubbornly held out for Juan and Beatriz—Neiva, Viana, Cer­ veira, Monção, Caminha, Braga, Guimarães, and Ponte de Lima. However, at Easter 1385, as we shall see in more detail later, various English vessels loaded with mercenaries docked at Lisbon, Setubal, and Porto. The old chancellor Lourenço Fogaça and the Mas­ ter of Santiago had managed to unblock their contracts in England. In response, Juan I ordered a new attack on Portugal. This time the offensive would take place on three fronts: the Castilian fleet would attack Lisbon, while a land army would once again invade Beira, and the king himself would lay siege to the Alentejan bor­ der town of Elvas. The plan was good, but operations went wrong, except for the naval operation. The incursion into Beira resulted in an absolute disaster, since the Castilian column carrying a considerable amount of loot on its return from Viseu was ambushed and slaughtered near Trancoso. This happened on May 29, 1385 and the heroes of the hour were Portuguese noblemen from the province of Beira: Gonçalo Vasques Coutinho, Martim Vasques da Cunha, João Fernandes Pacheco, and Egas Coelho, among others. All the captains in the service of Juan I perished in the fighting, with the exception of his chief cupbearer, Á� lvaro Garcí�a de Albornoz.2 To make matters worse, Elvas resisted siege by the king and he was therefore forced to change plans. He concentrated a large number of troops on the Portuguese–Castilian border and, in the second week of July, entered Portugal once again with a powerful, reinvigorated army.\n\nAugust 12, 1385\n\nOn August 12, 1385, with their faces illuminated by the lights of their camp, the com­ manders of the Portuguese and Castilian armies assessed the military situation and its possible outcomes. The army of Juan I, with a little more than twenty thousand men (including hundreds of French knights sent by King Charles VI), had just arrived 1 Lopes, Crónica del Rei Dom João I, Parte Primeira, chaps. 181–92.\n\n2 Barbosa and Gouveia, A Batalha de Trancoso.\n\n20\n\nJoão Gouveia Monteiro\n\nMap 1: The Theatre of the Portuguese– Castilian War 1385.\n\nin Leiria. This army had gathered in Ciudad Rodrigo at the end of June and entered Portugal through the region of Beira the following month, marching through Almeida and Trancoso. Here, as if exorcising the disaster suffered on May 29, he destroyed the hermitage of San Marcos and then went on to Celorico da Beira where, on July 21, the Castilian monarch took precautions to draft his will. This halt also served for Juan I to better organize his marching column and col­ lect more troops urgently requested from Castile, in order to form an army capable of avenging the humiliation suffered the previous year at the siege of Lisbon and bringing down the “Master of Avis,” who had called himself “King of Portugal” since April, 1385. It seems likely that, at this point, the intention of the Castilian command was to reach Santarém—the second most powerful garrison in the small Lusitanian kingdom, about eighty kilometres northeast of the capital—and then to push on to Lisbon, “the military key” to the country. If everything went according to plan, particularly since the fleet had\n\nFighting a Battle in the Middle Ages\n\n21\n\nalready been sent in April to cut off Lisbon by sea in April, the largest Portuguese city would hardly be able to resist further and prolonged harassment: what is more, this time there would not be a new outbreak of plague in the Castilian camp capable of sav­ ing the “Master of Avis.” So encouraged, the Castilian army moved forward to Coimbra (which did not wel­ come it within its walls) and then to Soure, where it must have arrived on August 9. On the way, it left a trail of destruction and blood. Having received information from his scouts that the enemy was already carrying out manoeuvres near Tomar (an old and emblematic Templar town), the Castilians opted to move closer to the coast, thereby avoiding a clash, and reaching Leiria three days later. Around twenty kilometres to the south, the Portuguese army, which would not have consisted of more than ten thousand men (amongst whom were several hundred Eng­ lish auxiliaries), finally made camp at Porto de Mós on the night of August 12, 1385. Throughout June King João I had been watching the Castilian siege on Elvas (on the south-eastern frontier, opposite Badajoz), but then, aware of the change of plans of his rival and the concentration of Castilian troops in Ciudad Rodrigo, he decided to abandon the province of the Alentejo, crossed the river Tagus and set up his main forces in Abran­ tes, right in the centre of Portugal. This position allowed him to manage various scenarios and respond quickly to any Castilian movement. When the direction of the march of his adversary became clearer, that is, when it was understood that Juan I was advancing to the south, head­ ing for Santarém and Lisbon, the young Portuguese monarch (twenty-eight years old and having ascended to the throne only four months ago) met with his war council in Abrantes on August 5 or 6, to decide the next steps. As we will see later, the meeting was quite animated, but led to the Constable Nuno Alvares Pereira’s opinion prevail­ ing. He claimed that it was absolutely imperative to face the enemy, by intercepting its marching column at a place still far from Lisbon and undertake a decisive battle against these forces. Accordingly, the Portuguese army advanced from Abrantes to Tomar, where they encamped on August 8. Three days later, he decided to go to Ourém in search of his adversary and, by the night of August 12, he had reached the village of Porto de Mós. With the two rivals stationed so close to each other, fighting became inevitable, espe­ cially because the Anglo-Portuguese army seemed willing to win or at least die in the attempt. It is this situation that makes the battle of Aljubarrota so interesting. In fact, pitched battles in the late Middle Ages were uncommon, especially battles between armies led by their respective kings, where the result would be so decisive. For such a battle to hap­ pen, both rivals needed to be willing to fight and to risk their luck in a single battle. It is therefore worthwhile, especially since this is the first book of a collection dedicated to major medieval battles, carefully analysing the meaning of a pitched battle in this period and why the most celebrated battle in Portuguese history was fought at the end of the afternoon of 14 August, on the São Jorge–Aljubarrota plateau.\n\n22\n\nJoão Gouveia Monteiro\n\nPitched Battles\n\nCan there be a real war without the “point of no return” of a pitched battle?3 For many decades, military historians did not believe so. A war without a battle would be a film without a plot or happy ending for either of the parties. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, authors such as Charles Oman, Hans Delbrück, and J. F. C. Fuller4 developed a military history highly centred and dependent on decisive events which brought two rival enemies together in a pitched battle as a final confrontation. Many of these authors were military officers and were marked by a Clausewitzian concept of war, namely, the continuation of politics through a mixture of other means, aiming at the ruthless annihilation of the adversary in pitched battle. Touched by their personal expe­ rience, these historians had the desire to explain the present, and this conditioned their observation of past confrontations. As John France explains, “our perspective upon war is, of course, affected by recent experience in which battle has been central in war. In two terrible world wars the commanders on either side strove to bring their enemies to bat­ tle, to smash their armies in the field, to bring them, even, to ‘unconditional surrender’.”5 In this type of military history, a practical interest prevailed which, coupled with a disconnection between military history and other types of historical research (a point emphasized by Ladero Quesada6), caused, as Garcí�a Fitz wrote, a “remarkably deformed” image of medieval war.7 Furthermore, the Middle Ages were badly dealt with in that rep­ resentation, with a lack of major pitched battles in the West being proof of the absence of military strategy, infancy in the art of war, mediocrity of medieval generals, and the impotence of the respective armies. However, more recent military historians, trained differently, such as Ferdinand Lot and John Beeler,8 have also had difficulty in breaking the mould and freeing themselves of the idea that battle is la crème de la crème. Even in John Keegan’s enthralling work entitled The Face of Battle, published in 1976 and which has so powerfully influenced modern generations of military historians, we find engraved the fatal sentence: “Armies 3 For the following, I have reworked an article originally presented as Monteiro “Estratégia e risco em Aljubarrota,” and later republished in João Gouveia Monteiro, Entre Romanos, Cruzados e Ordens Militares: Ensaios de história militar antiga e medieval (Coimbra: Salamandra, 2010).\n\n4 Charles W.

Military history […] must in the last resort be about battle.”9 More recently still, Victor Davis Hanson, an American researcher specialized in the military history of Classical Antiquity, extended this point of view in his work (prefaced by John Keegan) entitled The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece. In this magnificent book, which sparked a healthy debate between military historians, Hanson argued that the “model of Western war” had, since the period of the Hoplite soldiers who made up Greek armies in the Ancient and Classical periods, involved the search for decisive confrontation, in other words, battles. On the other hand, since the mid-twentieth century, the renewal of study into medi­ eval military history—nowadays with much deeper and multidisciplinary research and approaches—has confronted prejudices and revised old positions. The studies of R. C. Smail, Christopher Marshall, and David Nicolle10 on the Crusader armies, for example, showed how medieval warfare was not so primitive, nor did the commanders of the Middle Ages fail to provide their campaigns with an intelligent and profitable strategic orientation just because they did not lead to a pitched battle. New facets of medieval warfare (including recruitment, supplies, funding, commu­ nication systems, theoretical and practical training) began to be discovered, studied in depth (using available documents), and placed in the context of a “new military history” across all historical eras. Authors such as Warren Hollister, H. J. Hewitt, Claude Gaier, Philippe Contamine, Maurice Keen, and Christopher Allmand provided depth to Liddell Hart’s ideas about “strategies of indirect approach” and highlighted the importance of suitably planned attrition warfare and “obsidional” strategies (i.e., a tendency to take refuge inside walls) and ancillary strategies that gave meaning to medieval war despite the rarity of major confrontations in open battle.11 This historical renewal culminated in a “second wave” of works, particularly by Jim Bradbury, John Gillingham, Stephen Morillo, Matthew Strickland, John France, Matthew Bennett, and Michael Prestwich, who together helped form a new image of medieval war, re-establishing the battle within a much wider theoretical and operational context and proving that medieval war was much more than a succession of battles.12 The obsession 9 Cited from the Portuguese translation of The Face of Battle by John Keegan, as O rosto da batalha (Lisbon: Fragmentos, 1987), 22.\n\n10 Smail, Crusading Warfare, 1097–1193 (orig. ed.: 1956; 1995); Marshall, Warfare in the Latin; Nicolle, Crusader Warfare.\n\n11 Hollister, Anglo-Saxon Military Institutions on the Eve of the Norman Conquest; Hewitt, The Organization of War under Edward III; Gaier, Art et organisation militaires dans la principauté de Liège et dans le comté de Looz; Contamine, Guerre, État et Société à la fin du Moyen Âge and La Guerre au Moyen Âge; Keen, Medieval Warfare; Allmand, The Hundred Years War; and B.

The English Experience.\n\n24\n\nJoão Gouveia Monteiro\n\nwith studying open battles had sapped the energy of everything surrounding them and space had been made for new research of an extraordinary importance and fecundity. An Iberian example of that evolution and its potential is the classic (and still useful) study by Ambrosio Huici Miranda on the Reconquista and its battles (published in 1956) and the notable doctoral thesis from 1998 by Francisco Garcí�a Fitz dedicated to strate­ gies of expansion and military tactics in the context of the confrontations between Cas­ tile, Leon, and Islam in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.13 The study by Garcí�a Fitz clearly shows that in these three centuries, despite the scarcity of major open battles, the Castilian-Leonese world had a suitably planned, coherent, and successful strategy for territorial expansion, employing political, economic, diplomatic, and military means necessary to carry out its ambitious political objectives, which had been clearly defined a priori and carried out across various generations.14 If we look at the biographies of the Castilian-Leonese monarchs from Fernando I (whose death in 1065 led to pressure being put on the taifa kingdoms situated north of the Tagus river) until Sancho IV (to whom we owe, almost two and a half centuries later, the reclamation of a Christian pres­ ence in the Strait of Gibraltar), we can immediately understand that, with the exception of Afonso VIII (who led the Christian armies at Alarcos in 1195 and at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212), participation in pitched battles was extremely rare.15 However, that did not stop “the systematic application of an indirect approximation strategy which put into play political and military tools of various different kinds”16 which would prove to be decisive. At the time when he developed these ideas, Garcí�a Fitz17 had already benefited from the research of some of the English-speaking authors cited. In an 1984 study, for exam­ ple, Jim Bradbury counted only seven pitched battles which had taken place in England and in Normandy between 1066 and 1154, despite the lively nature of this period.18 Fur­ thermore, John Gillingham, in two acclaimed articles about the lives of Richard the Lion­ heart (1984) and William the Conqueror (1989), showed that, even in the lives of these warring knights, pitched battles were a surprising rarity. These findings brought military historians closer to the idea that pitched battles were rare and somewhat secondary occurrences in the context of medieval military strategy. So it behoved historians to turn their attention to other types of events, such as sieges. Bradbury, reporting on the twelfth century, estimated that “warfare consisted of perhaps one per cent battles and ninety-nine per cent sieges”19, cavalry raids, loot­ ing operations, destruction of land and property, and so on. This orientation spread in 13 A. Huici Miranda, Las grandes batallas de la Reconquista durante las invasiones africanas (Almorávides, Almohades y Benimerines) (Madrid: Instituto de Estudios Africanos, 1956); and Garcí�a Fitz, Castilla y León frente al Islam. 14 Garcí�a Fitz, Castilla y León frente al Islam, 56.\n\n15 Garcí�a Fitz, Las Navas de Tolosa, 79.\n\n16 Garcí�a Fitz, Castilla y León frente al Islam, 56.\n\n17 Garcí�a Fitz, Castilla y León frente al Islam, 21–57.\n\n18 Jim Bradbury, cited in Garcí�a Fitz, Las Navas de Tolosa, 34. 19 Bradbury, The Medieval Siege, 71.\n\nFighting a Battle in the Middle Ages\n\n25\n\nsuch a way that Matthew Strickland (in 1996) stated that the idea according to which “the majority of commanders were anxious to avoid pitched battle whenever possible, due to enormous strategic, political and physical risks which it entailed […] is now so commonplace that it may safely be said to have moved from revisionism to orthodoxy”!20 Hence the “Gillingham paradigm” of which Clifford Rogers speaks21 (and which Gilling­ ham prefers to call the “Smail paradigm”22). This meant taking the conceptual revision of military strategy started by R. C. Smail to a point at which “indirect war” and the absence of a pitched battle are so valued that this almost becomes a foreign body (in the sense of an extraordinary event) in the current practice of war.\n\nVegetius and the Theory and Practice of Warfare\n\nThis paradigm—this “new orthodoxy”—has been affirmed alongside the rediscovery of the opus magnum of Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, a Latin author who around 400 CE composed a treaty for the Roman emperor known as Epitoma rei militaris or De re militari. In this work, Vegetius (probably a high-ranking imperial officer) sought to explain how Roman armies from the golden times of the great Republican legionnaires and the Later Roman Empire were recruited, how they were internally organized, how they trained, and how they acted.23 What is more, Vegetius’s treatise was, in the words of Christopher Allmand,24 a medieval best-seller: it was definitely referenced by two hundred and twenty-six complete Latin manuscripts, making Vegetius the most copied classical author in the European West until 1300, followed by Cicero, Ovid, and Virgil. If the number of copies is taken together, not only the Latin manuscripts (complete or not) but also their translations into at least eight vernacular languages (Anglo-Norman, French, Italian, English, Castilian, Catalan, German, and Judeo-German), then the total reaches more than three hundred and twenty manuscripts, with dates situated between the seventh and nineteenth centuries with almost all (around ninety-four percent) from before 1500.25 These figures explain the diffusion of the Vegetian treatise across western erudite circles of the Middle Ages. Epitoma rei militaris speaks of a standing army (something that was not present in the European Middle Ages until the middle of the fifteenth century), an infantry-based army (which contrasts with the core of medieval armies) and whose elite (the legionnaires) were recruited from the peasantry and the harsh­ 20 Strickland, War and Chivalry, 43n69.\n\n21 Rogers, “The Vegetian ‘Science of Warfare’,” esp. 3.\n\n22 Gillingham, “‘Up with Orthodoxy!’,” 149–58, esp. 153.\n\n23 Vegetius, Epitoma Rei Militaris, ed.

However, the Middle Ages knew how to make its adapta­ tions (see the Siete Partidas of Afonso X of Castile–Leon, regarding the choice of horse­ men26) and absorbed those parts of Vegetius’s message that interested them the most. As Allmand showed, in his monumental study in 2011 on the reception and legacy of the Roman treatise, the marginalia left by medieval copyists and translators show that the Epitoma was seen not as a work from antiquity, but as a living text full of (military and political) teachings that were useful to medieval readers. That alone explains his popularity, facilitated by the fact that the Roman author was also a Christian. The church incorporated precepts from Vegetius in its collections of sermons and exempla, taking advantage of the (almost monastic) recommendations of frugality, tenacity, contempt for death, defence of the public good, and obedience to the Christian oath. At the time of the battle of Aljubarrota (1385), a considerable part of Vegetius’s message was still relevant for the growing monarchies: the apologia for a disciplined and well-trained army, exclusively in the service of the central power; distrust of troops of mercenaries; the importance of fortification; the value of attritional warfare and its logistics, connected with land defences and other natural elements; and even many spe­ cific tactical precepts, including various combat formations (such as square, wedge, or pincer formations, which reappear in the Siete Partidas27) along with multiple examples of practical advice—careful observation of the adversary, preparation of the morale of the troops, taking advantage of the terrain, use of surprise, maintaining secrecy in plan­ ning movements, respect for the chain of command, and so on. Even from the point of view of armaments and their management, some of the solutions advocated by Vegetius in the fifth century still maintained, mutatis mutandi, a certain degree of relevance at the end of the fourteenth century: mail shirts, shields, spears, slings, crossbows, swords, handled mainly as stabbing weapons, siege mantelets, and battering rams, among other pieces of equipment for the warriors. As Peter Russell put it, if the Middle Ages did not produce its own art of war until very late, to a large extent this was due to the fact that the Europeans in the Middle Ages saw no reason to abandon Vegetius.28 And the truth is we know that, right across the Middle Ages, Epitoma rei militaris seems to have been useful to medieval commanders and treatise writers. This has been demonstrated in the important studies by Bernard Bachrach (who analysed the cases of Freculf of Lisieux, Rabanus Maurus, Foulque Nerra, and Geoffrey Plantagenet, in the Early and Central Middle Ages)29 and Philippe Rich­ ardot (who dealt with John of Salisbury, Giles of Rome, Vincent of Beauvais, and Chris­ 26 Afonso X, Las Siete Partidas, particularly Titles 21 to 23 of the “Segunda Partida,” fols. 70–91.\n\n27 Afonso X, Las Siete Partidas, “Segunda Partida,” Tí�tulo 23, Ley 16, fols. 86v–87.\n\n28 Peter Russell, “The Medieval Castilian Translation of Vegetius, Epitoma de rei militaris: An Introduction,” in Spain and its Literature.

In Book 3 of his treatise, Vegetius addresses the issue of pitched battles several times. The essence of his doctrine on this matter is contained in the following precepts:\n\n–– “[A]\n\npitched battle is defined by a struggle lasting two or three hours, after which all hopes of the defeated party fall away” (chap. 9);\n\n–– “For good generals do not attack in open battle where the danger is mutual, but\n\ndo it always from a hidden position, so as to kill or at least terrorize the enemy while their own men are unharmed as far as possible” (chap. 9);\n\n–– “[The general] should deliberate whether it is expedient for the crisis to be pro­\n\nlonged or fought out more swiftly. For sometimes the enemy hopes that the cam­ paign can be ended quickly, and if it becomes long-drawn out, is either reduced by hunger, or called back to his own country by his men’s homesickness, or through doing nothing significant is compelled to leave in despair…” (chap. 9);\n\n–– “Be careful never to lead a hesitant and frightened army into a pitched battle” (chap. 9);\n\n–– “So let the general be watchful, sober and discreet. […] If he finds himself supe­\n\nrior in many particulars, let him be not slow to enter a battle favourable to him­ self. If he recognizes that the enemy is stronger, let him avoid a pitched battle, because forces fewer in numbers and inferior in strength carrying out raids and ambushes under good generals have often brought back a victory” (chap. 9);\n\n–– “Our analysis of military science invites us to consider the hazard of the general\n\nengagement, the fateful day for nations and peoples. For total victory depends upon the outcome of an open battle. Therefore this is the time when generals should exert themselves all the more, in proportion as the vigorous may hope for greater glory, and worse peril dogs the slack. This is the moment when appli­ cation of skill, theory of warfare and planning dominate” (chap. 11);\n\n–– “Explore carefully how soldiers are feeling on the actual day they are going to\n\nfight. […] Do not be fully confident if it is the recruits who want battle, for war is sweet to the inexperienced. You will know to postpone it if the experienced warriors are afraid of fighting” (chap. 12);\n\n30 Richardot, Végèce et la culture militaire, 78–84.\n\n31 Allmand, “The Fifteenth-Century English Versions,” 44 and 136–44; Allmand, The De Re Militari of Vegetius, 63–80; and Richardot, Végèce et la culture militaire, 48–54.\n\n28\n\nJoão Gouveia Monteiro\n\n–– “In all battles the terms of campaign are such that what benefits you harms the enemy, and what helps him always hinders you” (chap. 26);\n\n–– “It is better to subdue an enemy by famine, raids and terror, than in battle where fortune tends to have more influence than bravery” (chap. 26);\n\n–– “Bravery is of more value than numbers” (chap. 26); –– “Terrain is often of more value than bravery” (chap. 26); –– “He who does not prepare grain-supplies and provisions is conquered without a blow” (chap. 26);\n\n–– “Good generals never engage in a general engagement except on some advanta­ geous occasion, or under great necessity” (chap. 26);\n\n–– “It is a powerful disposition to press the enemy more with famine than with the sword” (chap. 26).32\n\nThis demonstrates why the “Gillingham paradigm” is related to Vegetius’s treatise. The relative scarcity of pitched battles in the Middle Ages, their rarity in the careers of the major military leaders, the certainty that medieval generals knew and successfully car­ ried out other forms of strategy (based on indirect approximation, a war of attrition, and logistical weakening), the widespread dissemination of the Epitoma in learned circles, the nature of some of Vegetius’s precepts on pitched battles, and on the existence of alternative ways of obtaining victory in the military campaign explain why pitched bat­ tles were avoided.\n\nReaction against the “New Orthodoxy”\n\nThe historical “new orthodoxy” has been influential, particularly the assertion that medieval commanders were eager to avoid pitched battles whenever possible, due to a large and varied number of reasons, three of which can be emphasized:\n\na) the enormous risks (strategic, political, and even physical) which pitched battles entailed;33 b) the impossibility of controlling all the variables (military, mental, or other) from the moment when physical contact between the opposing lines was established;34 c) the limited gains that a victory in open combat could yield (e.g., the battle of Zalaca, in 1086, with the victory of the Almoravid caliph over Alfonso VI of Castile– Leon), especially if the defeated party had good fortifications in its rear-guard to where it could withdraw and from where it could resist for a long time, forcing the enemy into mobilizations involving considerable human and financial resources.35\n\n32 Vegetius: Epitome, trans.

Stephen Morillo (“Battle Seeking,”\n\nFighting a Battle in the Middle Ages\n\n29\n\nUnder this logic, where the whims of fate made the result of a battle unpredictable (and left open the possibility of a disastrous defeat, such as that suffered by Harold Godwinson at Hastings in 1066) and where, even in victory, the relation between defen­ sive and offensive resources in siege warfare was so favourable to the former that a vic­ tory in battle could in the end mean very little (forcing the victors then, one by one, to besiege rebel fortresses, in a true “Sisyphean task,” in the words of Stephen Morillo36), it was natural that medieval generals opted for other strategic alternatives. Battles would therefore appear something to be avoided, especially when other forms of war were available: devastation of the enemy’s territory, destruction of the eco­ nomic and logistical resources of the adversary (barns, houses, mills, furnaces, presses, etc.), capture of cities, sabotaging supply routes and, of course, weakening the enemy’s human resources (by carrying out, for example, surgical attacks causing deaths and the taking of prisoners). There was also the possibility of initiating actions to undermine the unity and morale of the adversaries, a tactic equally dear to Vegetius: “It is (also) the mark of a skilled general to sow seeds of discord among the enemy. For no nation, however small, can be completely destroyed by its enemies, unless it devours itself by its own feuding” (bk. 3, chap. 10). A pitched battle was only a last resort, when it could not be avoided (as happened to the caliph al-Nasir at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212),37 or when the superiority of one of the parties appeared to be so overwhelming that it seemed almost blasphemous not to seize the opportunity to bring the burden of divine judgement upon the adversary. The marriage between a new approach to medieval military history and a strategic premise inspired by Vegetius that was based on the principle of annihilating the enemy by wear, tear, and hunger, rather than by iron and pitched battles, seemed perfect. But it raised a set of interesting objection, led by a major specialist in the art of medieval warfare (Clifford Rogers, from the West Point Military Academy) and included in the opening article in the first issue (in 2002) of the Journal of Medieval Military History, one of the most fruitful publishing projects in modern medieval military historiography.38 In short, Rogers—whose studies on the English campaigns in Scotland and France during the reign of Edward III (1327–1377)39 had already made him sceptical of the unwillingness of medieval generals to wage a pitched battle—refuted the idea that fighting a pitched battle was a secondary option, or even a solution of last resort 23–24), states that Vegetius’s strategy gives a central role to fortifications in the defence of a territory (“Logistic warfare; a central role for fortifications; a resulting paucity of battles: Vegetian strategy in a nutshell” (24)). In this sense, as the same author adds (41), Capetian France (with an early castle and kingdom structure “stitched together” by “foreign conquest”) was much more Vegetian than England (from early on a unified kingdom with early centralization and where the construction of forts only gained force after the Norman conquest of 1066)."
