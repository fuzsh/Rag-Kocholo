        "text": "Full Name: Ferdinand I, called the Handsome or the Fickle\n\nProfession: King of Portugal\n\nBiography: Ferdinand I of Portugal, also known as \"the Handsome\" or \"the Fickle,\" was King of Portugal from 1367 until his death in 1383. His reign was marked by internal struggles for power, military challenges, and complex negotiations with neighboring Castile. One of the most notable episodes was his involvement in the Fernandine Wars, a series of campaigns against Castile, which ultimately resulted in no significant gains for Portugal.\n\nIn addition to his military pursuits, Ferdinand I's reign was complicated by his personal life. His marriage to Leonor Telles de Meneses was mired in scandal, as she was already married when they began their affair. The relationship was highly unpopular with both the Portuguese public and nobility. His reign saw ongoing domestic strife, fueled by his inconsistent policies and the influence of Queen Leonor.\n\nFerdinand I died without a male heir, leading to a crisis of succession that resulted in the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. This was a tumultuous period featuring a struggle for the crown among Portuguese nobles, as well as between Portugal and Castile. The crisis was eventually resolved with the rise to power of John I of Portugal, who founded the Avis dynasty and stabilized the nation.\n\nBorn: October 31, 1345\n\nBirthplace: Coimbra, Portugal\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio\n\nDied: October 22, 1383 (aged 37)\n\nCause of Death: Poisoning suspected\n\nHistorical Events\n\nAnglo-Portuguese Treaty of Perpetual Alliance (world's oldest still in existence) signed in London between King Edward III of England and King Ferdinand I of Portugal\n\nReferences\n\nHistoryâ€™s Unparalleled Alliance: the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of Windsor, 9th May 1386 - GOV.UK\n\nFamous Kings"
