However, this whole story was a\n\nliterary invention. The story of Ramiro originated with Ramiro having\n\nhis son and heir Ordono by the sister of Alboazar of Gaia. The son then\n\nbecame, through subsequent versions, Audonio, Antonio, and finally\n\nAlboazar. This last appears to have been particularly attractive to the\n\nMaia family, who traced their origins to a man named Alboazar. However,\n\nas seen in the work of Jose Mattoso, this man was Alboazar Lovesindez -\n\nson of Lovesindo.\n\n> The other is a supposed son of the Portuguese King D.

In addition, at the\n\ntime of Ramiro III, the nomenclatural system was very strict. Thus it\n\nis possible to conclude with 100% certainty that if there was a Vela\n\nOsorio, then he was son of a man named Osorio. Since the name Osorio\n\nwas used by at least one member of the \"Vela\" clan, then that may be a\n\ngood place to look for this Vela, son of Osorio. For Martim Moniz,\n\nagain I would suggest the work of Mattoso.\n\n> From this union I know there was a child, but I don't know his name.\n\n> Another branch interlinks with a soon of the Portuguese King D.

According to Sousa's HGCRP Book XIII,\n\nFernand was married several times (and often concurrently!) and had 42\n\nchildren! (Altrhough not all of these survived him). His descendants are\n\ntherefore to be found throughout Spain and Portugal."
