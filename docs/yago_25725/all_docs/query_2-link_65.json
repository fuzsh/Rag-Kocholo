        "text": "Optica aperture synthesis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan der Avoort, Casper\n\n2006-05-01\n\nOptical long baseline stellar interferometry is an observational technique in astronomy that already exists for over a century, but is truly blooming during the last decades. The undoubted value of stellar interferometry as a technique to measure stellar parameters beyond the classical resolution limit is more and more spreading to the regime of synthesis imaging. With optical aperture synthesis imaging, the measurement of parameters is extended to the reconstruction of high resolution stellar images. A number of optical telescope arrays for synthesis imaging are operational on Earth, while space-based telescope arrays are being designed. For all imaging arrays, the combination of the light collected by the telescopes in the array can be performed in a number of ways. In this thesis, methods are introduced to model these methods of beam combination and compare their effectiveness in the generation of data to be used to reconstruct the image of a stellar object. One of these methods of beam combination is to be applied in a future space telescope. The European Space Agency is developing a mission that can valuably be extended with an imaging beam combiner. This mission is labeled Darwin, as its main goal is to provide information on the origin of life. The primary objective is the detection of planets around nearby stars - called exoplanets- and more precisely, Earth-like exoplanets. This detection is based on a signal, rather than an image. With an imaging mode, designed as described in this thesis, Darwin can make images of, for example, the planetary system to which the detected exoplanet belongs or, as another example, of the dust disk around a star out of which planets form. Such images will greatly contribute to the understanding of the formation of our own planetary system and of how and when life became possible on Earth. The comparison of beam combination methods for interferometric imaging occupies most of the pages of this thesis. Additional chapters will treat related subjects, being experimental work on beam combination optics, a description of a novel formalism for aberration retrieval and experimental work on nulling interferometry. The Chapters on interferometric imaging are organized in such a way that not only the physical principles behind a stellar interferometer are clear, but these chapters also form a basis for the method of analysis applied to the interferometers - -or rather beam combination methods- under consideration. The imaging process in a stellar interferometer will be treated as the inversion of a linear system of equations. The definition of interferometric imaging in this thesis can be stated to be the reconstruction of a luminosity distribution function on the sky, that is, in angular measure, larger than the angular diffraction limited spot size -or Point-Spread Function (PSF)- of a single telescope in the array and that contains, again in angular measure, spatial structure that is much smaller than the PSF of a single telescope. This reconstruction has to be based on knowledge of the dimensions of the telescope array and the detector. The detector collects intensity data that is formed by observation of the polychromatic luminosity distribution on the sky and is deteriorated by the quantum-nature of light and an imperfect electronic detection process. Therefore, the imaging study presented in this thesis can be regarded to be a study on the signal characteristics of various interferometers while imaging a polychromatic wide-field stellar source. The collection of beam combination methods under consideration consists of four types. Among these are two well-known types, having either co-axially combined beams as in the Michelson-Morley experiment to demonstrate the existence of ether, or beams that follow optical paths as if an aperture mask were placed in front of a telescope, making the beams combine in the focus of that telescope, as suggested by Fizeau. For separated apertures rather than an aperture mask, these optical paths are stated to be homothetic. In short, these two types will be addressed as the Michelson or the Homothetic type. The other two types are addressed as Densified and Staircase. The first one is short for densified pupil imaging, an imaging technique very similar to the Homothetic type, be it that the natural course of light after the aperture mask is altered. However, the combination of the beams of light is again in focus. The Staircase method is an alternative to the co-axial Michelson method and lends its name from the fact that a staircase-shaped mirror is placed in an intermediate focal plane after each telescope in the array, before combining the beams of light co-axially. This addition allows stellar imaging as with the Michelson type, with the advantage of covering a large field-of-view. The details of these methods will intensively be discussed in this thesis, but the introduction of them at this point allows a short list of results, found by comparing them for equal imaging tasks. Homothetic imagers are best suited for covering a wide field-of-view, considering the information content of the interferometric signals these arrays produce. The large number of detectors does not seem to limit the imaging performance in the presence of noise, due to the high ratio of coherent versus incoherent information in the detector signal. The imaging efficiency of a Michelson type array is also high, although -considering only polychromatic wide-field imaging tasks- the ratio of coherent versus incoherent information in the detected signals is very low. This results in very large observation times needed to produce images comparable to those obtained with a Homothetic array. A detailed presentation of the characteristics of the detected signals in a co-axial Michelson array reveal that such signals, obtained by polychromatic observation of extended sources, have fringe envelope functions that do not allow Fourier-spectroscopy to obtain high-resolution spectroscopic information about such a source. For the Densified case, it is found that this method can indeed provide an interferometric PSF that is more favorable than a homothetic PSF, but only for narrow-angle observations. For polychromatic wide-field observations, the Densified-PSF is field-dependent, for which the image reconstruction process can account. Wide-field imaging using the favorable properties of the Densified-PSF can be performed, by using special settings of the delay or optical path length difference between interferometer arms and including observations with several settings of delay in the observation data. The Staircase method is the second best method for the imaging task under consideration. The discontinuous nature of the staircase-shaped mirrors does not give rise to a discontinuous reconstructed luminosity distribution or non-uniformly covered spatial frequencies. The intrinsic efficiency of the interferometric signal in this type of interferometer is worse than that of the other co-axial method, although the ratio of coherent versus incoherent signal in the data -the length of the fringe packet in one intensity trace-e- is nearly ultimate. The inefficiency is overwhelmingly compensated for by the very short observation time needed. Besides numerical studies of interferometer arrays, one interferometric imager was also studied experimentally. A homothetic imager was built, comprising three telescopes with fully separated beam relay optics. The pointing direction, the location and the optical path length of two of the three beams are electronically controllable. The beams can be focused together to interfere, via a beam combiner consisting of curved surfaces. This set-up allows to measure the required accuracies at which certain optical elements have to be positioned. Moreover, this set-up demonstrates that without knowledge of the initial pointing directions, locations and optical path lengths of the beams, the situation of homothesis can be attained, solely based on information from the focal plane of the set-up. Further experiments show that the approximation of exact homothesis is limited by the optical quality of the beam combiner optics. Parallel to the experiments on homothesis, a study was performed to evaluate the use of the Extended Nijboer-Zernike (ENZ) formalism for analysis of multiple aperture optical systems. It is envisaged that an aberration retrieval algorithm, provided with the common focus of a homothetic array, can be used to detect misalignment of or even aberrations in the sub-apertures of the sparse synthetic aperture. The ENZ formalism is a powerful tool to describe the focal intensity profile in an optical imaging system, imaging a monochromatic point source through a pupil that is allowed to have a certain transmission profile and phase aberration function over the pupil. Moreover, the formalism allows calculation of intensity profiles outside the best-focus plane. With the intensity information of several through-focus planes, enough information is available to reconstruct the pupil function from it. The formalism is described, including the reconstruction algorithm. Although very good results are obtained for general pupil functions, the results for synthetic pupil functions are not very promising. The detailed description of the ENZ-aberration retrieval reveals the origin of the breakdown of the retrieval process. Finally, a description of experiments on nulling interferometry is given, starting with the presentation of an experimental set-up for three-beam nulling. A novel strategy for polychromatic nulling is treated here, with the goal of relieving the tight phase constraint on the spectra in the individual beams. This theoretically allows broad band-nulling with a high rejection ratio without using achromatic phase shifters. The disappointing results led to an investigation of the spectra of the individual beams. The origin of the unsatisfactory level of the rejection ratio is found in the spectral unbalance of the beams. Before branching off, the beams have an equal spectrum. Then, the encounter of different optical elements with individually applied coatings, the control of beam-power per beam and finally the beam coupling into a single-mode fiber, apparently alter the spectra in such a way that the theoretically achievable level of the rejection ratio cannot be reached. The research described in this thesis provides onsets for research in several areas of interest related to aperture synthesis and guidelines concerning the design of synthetic telescopes for imaging. As such, this research contributes to the improvement of instrumentation for observational astronomy, in particular for stellar interferometry. While nulling interferometry is the detection technique that allows a space telescope array such as ESA-Darwin to identify exoplanets, optical aperture synthesis imaging is the technique that can make images of the planetary systems to which these exoplanets belong. Moreover, many objects can be observed that represent earlier versions of our planetary system, our Sun and even our galaxy, the Milky Way. Observing these objects might answer questions about the origins of the Earth itself and the life on it.\n\nTecnicas avanzadas de medida en intensimetria acustica para la caracterizacion de materiales aislantes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMunuera Saura, Gregorio\n\nThe measurement rate of acoustic reduction (R) in an insulating material is determined in special designed enclosures according to UNE EN ISO 140-1 standard. The construction of a testing room that complies with the standards requires a significant financial investment, that too often can not be provided by general machinery manufacturers. The outdoor machines have to be designed considering the noise emission limits established in the European Directive 2000/14, making the installment of insulating materials in enclosures of machines necessary. Suppliers of insulating materials for industrial use does not normally provide the insulating properties of their products, which are often obtained from rock wool, polyethylene, polyurethane, synthetic rubber, etc. It is difficult to test these materials that are characterized by low density surface in a room standardized test procedure that is based on the measurement of sound pressure. The main problem is getting the validation of the measurement when the rate of acoustic reduction is relatively low, as in the case of materials mentioned above. An alternative procedure is proposed in this Doctoral Thesis based on the measurement of sound intensity. The vector nature of this parameter allows just the flow of energy through a given surface to be measured. The validation of the measurement is achieved with the highest degree of accuracy by applying the criteria included in the standard UNE EN ISO 9614. A steel plate 6 mm thick incorporated with a sound source for amplification of a pink noise signal is designed for carrying out the tests. Faced with the source is placed a piece of material to test. The source is connected and the transmitted sound intensity is measured with a probe consisting of two microphones located opposite one another. Previously it has been determined the flow of acoustic energy that impinges on the piece. The difference between the two measures provides directly the rate of acoustic reduction. The main advantage of the described test procedure is that it can be done in a room with normal dimensions and without specific conditioning. The vibroacoustic behaviour of the testing box and its influence on the measures is another important aspect to be considered. A test of modal analysis has been carried out with a steel plate similar to the enclosures of the box. A mathematical model based on the Statistical Energy Analysis SEA has been developed to estimate the paths of energy transmission from the sound source to the point of measurement with the sound intensity probe. The commercial software AUTOSEA2 LT is used. General conclusions regarding the alternative method of measurement and specific ones related to the capacity of insulation of the tested materials have been obtained. As for the general conclusions, the limitations of measuring with the intensity probe at low and high frequencies have been proved, validating measurements with an accuracy of 0.5 dB according to the criteria set forth in the standard UNE EN ISO 9614 Part 3 have been obtained, and a new test procedure for easy determination of the rate of acoustic reduction of an insulating material with low density surface has been established. Finally, the devised procedure allows future developments in the field of vibroacoustics, such as the application of the principle of reciprocity and the determination of acoustic impedance of materials by application of techniques for measuring of acoustics intensity."
