        "text": "The story of the Dead Queen is a secondary episode in the history of Portugal, but it is so amazing that it has given rise to many legends, books and plays.\n\nInes de Castro, and the young Prince Peter of Portugal.\n\nInes de Castro, born in 1325 in Coimbra (Northern Portugal), came from one of the most powerful families in Castile. At the age of 14, she was placed as a lady-in-waiting to Constance of Castile, who was promised to Peter of Portugal, the heir to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAs in all great tragedies, the story begins with a love story: Prince Peter of Portugal falls in love with Ines de Castro and neglects his bride, Constance.\n\nPedro e Inês\n\nThe Prince's father, King Alfonso 4, disapproved of this affair mainly for reasons of power. Indeed, Ines' relatives also became friends of the young Prince and the \"Clan of Castro\" extended its influence.\n\nIn 1344, he exiled Ines Castro to the castle of Albuquerque (Spain), on the Castilian border. The two lovers then started an assiduous correspondence.\n\nCastillo de Luna Albuquerque - Credit oliraf.com\n\nAt the same time, Princess Constance died giving birth to the future King Ferdinand I of Portugal. Peter, now a widower, called Ines back to the Court. Their relationship, out of wedlock, gave birth to 4 children who could then claim the Throne in case of Prince Ferdinand's death.\n\nOn its side, the \"Clan of Castro\" extends its power to the Kingdom of Castile, border of the very young Portugal by marrying the sister of Ines to the new King of Castile.\n\nPeter and Ines refrained from intervening in these struggles for influence and settled in Coimbra in the palace of Santa Clara.\n\nThe murder of Ines de Castro.\n\nAfter several attempts to keep the lovers apart, King Alfonso 4 feared that his son, under the influence of the \"Clan of Castro\", would take part in the Castilian political crisis that was still going on.\n\nHe then orders the assassination of Ines. Pêro Coelho, Âlaro Gonçalves and Diogo Lopes Pacheco, appointed to execute Ines, went to Santa Clara and, taking advantage of Peter's absence, murdered Ines on January 7, 1355.\n\nThe coronation of the Dead Queen.\n\nTwo years later, in 1357, Alfonso 4 died and Peter was crowned. He announced that he had secretly married Ines seven years earlier. This announcement, confirmed by witnesses, legitimizes his descent.\n\nHe then had the body of Ines dug up, dressed her in a purple cloak, a sign of royalty, and seated her on the throne of Portugal, forcing the entire court to come and kiss her hand.\n\nCoronation of Ines de Castro - Pierre-Charles comte 1849\n\nThe assassins are pursued and some of them are captured. The King will demand that their hearts be torn out of their chests while he witnesses the scene at a banquet.\n\nThe funeral of Ines.\n\nA new funeral was then organized for Ines. They will be celebrated in the Monastery of Alcobaça where two splendid tombs will be built. Peter will join Ines in 1367.\n\nTomb of Ines de Castro, Monastère d'Alcobaça\n\nTheir tombs, side by side, were moved several times before being placed face to face. According to the legend, they will be able to look into each other's eyes when they wake up for the last judgment.\n\nMosteiro de Alcobaça\n\nThe works born from the story of the Dead Queen.\n\nMany Portuguese and Spanish poems evoke the tragedy of the dead Queen, notably those of Camoens, famous Portuguese poet in the Lusiades.\n\nPlays are also based on this legend. In particular that of Montherlant \"The Dead Queen\".\n\nThe Dead Queen, a play by Montherlant\n\nOperas have been written in homage to Ines de Castro, including those of Zingarelli in Italy, Scartazzini in Germany and Matthews in England.\n\nFinally, the cinema could not miss this story and Carlos Santos and José Leitão de Barros have adapted the legend on the big screen.\n\nThe Dead Queen - Film by Pierre Boutron (2009)"
