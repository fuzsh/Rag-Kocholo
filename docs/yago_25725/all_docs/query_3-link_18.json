Born in February 1372 (some sources cite 1373) at Coimbra, Portugal; died after 1409 inMadrigal, Portugal; daughter of Fernando also known as Ferdinand I the Handsome, king of Portugal (r. 1367–1383), andLeonora Telles (c. 1350–1386); married Edward, duke of York, in July 1381 (annulled 1382); became second wife of Juan also known as John I, king of Castile and Leon (r. 1379–1390), on April 30, 1383; children: none. John of Castile's first wife wasEleanor of Aragon (1358–1382).\n\nBeatrice's unfortunate story begins with her illegitimate birth to Ferdinand I, king of Portugal, and Leonora Telles , his mistress. When it became clear that he would have no sons, Ferdinand had Beatrice officially legitimized and named his heir. He negotiated many betrothals for her but changing national power prevented each from being finalized. Eventually, Ferdinand was forced by the more powerful King Henry II of Castile to sign a marriage agreement between Beatrice and John, the son of the Castilian king. This agreement was a triumph for Henry II, who looked forward to adding Portugal to his Castilian domains when Beatrice succeeded her father. However, Henry predeceased Ferdinand, and his son became King John I of Castile.\n\nAt age 12, Beatrice married John of Castile in 1383, the same year her father died. Beatrice's mother Leonora Telles attempted to establish herself as regent for Beatrice, but the marriage agreement between Beatrice and her husband gave the Portuguese crown to King John, and there was little Leonora could do to prevent John of Castile from ruling Portugal. Wishing to remain independent of Castile, the Portuguese people strongly resented this virtual coup d'état by the Castilians; consequently, they refused to support Beatrice as their queen because accepting her rule meant accepting the rule of her Castilian husband. Instead, they denied the validity of her claim to the throne and supported the much weaker claims of an illegitimate half-brother of King Ferdinand, who accepted their support and was crowned as King John I of Portugal. In 1386, Beatrice's mother Leonora died. With Portugal already lost, Beatrice's husband no longer wanted or needed the Portuguese alliance. In 1387, he had their marriage annulled, then married into the English royal house. Beatrice returned to Portugal where she died some years later."
