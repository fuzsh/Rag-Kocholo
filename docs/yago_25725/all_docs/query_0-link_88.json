        "text": "Carlos Zimmermann SJ was an important pedagogue and one of the most influential naturalists working in Portugal at the beginning of the twentieth century. He was an active promoter of an experimental approach to the teaching of the natural sciences, and one of the founders of the leading Portuguese scientific journal, Brotéria. His main area of research was the identification and classification of novel species of diatoms (one of the largest groups of microscopic algae). In the aftermath of the expulsion of the religious orders in 1910, the newly-established Portuguese Republic confiscated Jesuit scientific books, instruments and collections, including those produced by Zimmermann. Exiled to Brazil from 1911, he remained there until his death in 1950. This article focuses on the main questions relating to the organisation, apprehension, and partial restitution of these collections. By analysing a set of sixteen unpublished documents, recently found in a private archive and now published as an appendix, the article reconstructs the trajectory and significance of Zimmermann’s body of work. It elucidates, furthermore, the complex diplomatic and political circumstances, as well as the central role of correspondence networks, that led to the retrieval of these documents.\n\nAfter their restoration in 1814, the Jesuits renewed their scientific tradition and have continued it up to the present day. Although this period has not received as much attention as the one stretching from the foundation of the order in 1540 to its suppression in 1773, the establishment of observatories throughout the world, beginning in 1824 and tapering off since about 1970, has aroused a certain degree of interest among historians. Articles on the subject are divided into those of general scope and those dealing with specific observatories. The fields of astronomy, meteorology, and geophysics are of particular interest, and special attention is given to the study of tropical hurricanes, seismology, and geomagnetism. These articles are a good source of information about Jesuits' work in the observatories. But other Jesuit scientific contributions have received little attention. One such neglected subject is the research conducted at Jesuit colleges and universities in fields like mathematics, physics, and biology. Contributions to biology and environmental studies, especially in India, are a more recent concern that the literature has yet to address. Another area awaiting fuller development is the biography of Jesuit scientists, although some attention has been given to Angelo Secchi (1818–78) and Stephen Perry (1833–89). (Pierre Teilhard de Chardin [1881–1955], who has a very abundant bibliography devoted to him, is a special case.) The spirituality of Jesuit scientists and their position in the dialogue between science and religion are ripe for further exploration as well.\n\nFor several centuries, the dichotomy between science and religion widened, so much so that these were considered two opposing fields of knowledge. On one side, stood the defenders of rationality, and on the other, obscurantism. Following the anti-Jew myth, with the Enlightenment, the anti-Jesuit myth emerged. This myth started to gain momentum in Portugal with the Marquis of Pombal. Starting from this framework, we raise the following core questions: Were the Jesuits enemies or ardent supporters of science? Can it be that their concern was limited to the religious catechism, and opposed the teaching and dissemination of science? In face of what was stated above, we highlight the following goals: (i) to analyse the role played by the Jesuits in disseminating science in Portugal; (ii) to reflect on the importance given by Jesuits to the social and hygienist pedagogy. As regards methodology, we followed two dimensions of analysis: (1) science, religion, teaching-innovation and dissemin..."
