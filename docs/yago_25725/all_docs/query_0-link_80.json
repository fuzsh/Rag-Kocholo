        "text": "Corridors of crestal and radial faults linking salt diapirs in the EspÃ­rito Santo Basin, SE Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMattos, Nathalia H.; Alves, Tiago M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis work uses high-quality 3D seismic data to assess the geometry of fault families around salt diapirs in SE Brazil (EspÃ­rito Santo Basin). It aims at evaluating the timings of fault growth, and suggests the generation of corridors for fluid migration linking discrete salt diapirs. Three salt diapirs, one salt ridge, and five fault families were identified based on their geometry and relative locations. Displacement-length (D-x) plots, Throw-depth (T-z) data and structural maps indicate that faults consist of multiple segments that were reactivated by dip-linkage following a preferential NE-SW direction. This style of reactivation and linkage is distinct from other sectors of the EspÃ­rito Santo Basin where the preferential mode of reactivation is by upwards vertical propagation. Reactivation of faults above a Mid-Eocene unconformity is also scarce in the study area. Conversely, two halokinetic episodes dated as Cretaceous and Paleogene are interpreted below a Mid-Eocene unconformity. This work is important as it recognises the juxtaposition of permeable strata across faults as marking the generation of fault corridors linking adjacent salt structures. In such a setting, fault modelling shows that fluid will migrate towards the shallower salt structures along the fault corridors first identified in this work.\n\nPockmark asymmetry and seafloor currents in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSchattner, U.; Lazar, M.; Souza, L. A. P.; ten Brink, Uri S.; Mahiques, M. M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPockmarks form by gas/fluid expulsion into the ocean and are preserved under conditions of negligible sedimentation. Ideally, they are circular at the seafloor and symmetrical in profile. Elliptical pockmarks are more enigmatic. They are associated with seafloor currents while asymmetry is connected to sedimentation patterns. This study examines these associations through morphological analysis of new multibeam data collected across the Santos continental slope offshore Brazil in 2011 (353â865 mbsl). Of 984 pockmarks, 78% are both elliptical and asymmetric. Geometric criteria divide the pockmarks into three depth ranges that correlate with a transition between two currents: the Brazil Current transfers Tropical Water and South Atlantic Central Water southwestwards while the Intermediate Western Boundary Current transfers Antarctic Intermediate Water northeastwards. It is suggested that the velocity of seafloor currents and their persistence dictate pockmark ellipticity, orientation and profile asymmetry. Fast currents (>20 cm/s) are capable of maintaining pockmark flank steepness close to the angle of repose. These morphological expressions present direct evidence for an edge effect of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre and, in general, provide a correlation between pockmark geometry and seafloor currents that can be applied at other locations worldwide.\n\nAuthigenic chlorite as a controlling factor in the exploration of Turonian/Coniacian turbidites in the Santos Basin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPorsche, E.; Lopes de Freitas, E.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nUpper Turonian/Coniacian and Campanian turbidites are major targets for petroleum exploration in the Santos Basin, southeastern Brazil. They occur between 140 and 1000 m of present water depth, are buried at about 4500 m, and reach thickness of up to 60 m. The main reservoir facies is composed of unstratified, fine to very fine grained, poorly sorted sandstones, which framework is compositionally immature, including a high proportion of feldspars and volcanic rock fragments. Early coating of grains by authigenic chlorite inhibited pressure solution and quartz cementation in the reservoir. This diagenetic characteristic allowed important preservation of primary porosity (>20%) inmoreÂ Â» the reservoir; nevertheless its permeability never exceeds 30 ml. The study of sedimentary facies and related depositional processes has been conducted to predict the distribution of petroleum-bearing turbidites throughout the Santos Basin; this comprises a major challenge for the petroleum exploration in this important Brazilian exploration frontier.Â«Â less\n\nNew species and records of Perlidae (Plecoptera) from EspÃ­rito Santo State, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonÃ§alves, MaÃ­sa DE Carvalho; Novaes, Marcos Carneiro; Salles, Frederico FalcÃ£o\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTwo new species of the perlid genus Anacroneuria, A. rotunda n. sp and A. pitii n. sp are described from EspÃ­rito Santo State, Brazil. Additionally, six species of Anacroneuria and four species of Kempnyia are reported for the first time from EspÃ­rito Santo State. Records are also provided for A. debilis, A. subcostalis, K. flava, K. gracilenta, and K. neotropica. An undetermined species of Macrogynoplax based on nymphs is also reported from EspÃ­rito Santo State.\n\nCytherellid species (Ostracoda) and their significance to the Late Quaternary events in the Santos Basin, Brazil\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBergue, C.T.; Coimbra, J.C.; Cronin, T. M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFour autochthonous cytherellid species (Cytherella serratula (BRADY, 1880), C. hermargentina WHATLEY et al. 1998, C. pleistocenica sp. nov. and C. santosensis sp. nov.) have been identified from two offshore cores (44 samples) within the Santos Basin. The distribution of these ostracodes is controlled by local hydrological conditions such as the temperature and, possibly, the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). However, these factors cannot explain completely the species occurrence in the analysed cores, and relative sea level changes and productivity variation driven by climatic changes are proposed as additional explanations for the faunal distribution pattern. ??

The cruise was carried ou on board the research vessel (R/V) Yokosuka that hosts the human operated vehicle (HOV) SHINKAI 6500. It aimed at finding chemosynthetic communities, composed of organisms capable of generating their own vital energy by metabolizing organic and inorganic compounds related to seeps. Identification of these organisms could provide information for understanding the origin of life, since they may resemble primitive organisms that existed in the initial stages of life on Earth. During Leg 2 (May 10-24, 2013), however, dives on the northern part of the SÃ£o Paulo Plateau at the EspÃ­rito Santo Basin led to the discovery of a giant oil seep. The seep, ca. 3 nautical miles (ca. 5.6 km) in length is located along an outcrop of Eocene rocks on a salt-induced escarpment of the plateau and at a water depth of ca. 2700 m. The 200 m relief of the seafloor suggests that the seep takes place along an active fault system driven by salt diapirism. The oil was analyzed and identified as a severely biodegraded marine oil, generated by carbonate rocks within a minibasin located to the east of the escarpment. This represents valuable exploratory information because it proves that an active petroleum system is present in the context of minibasins associated with salt diapirism in the area.\n\nThree new species of Bertolonia (Melastomataceae) from EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nBacci, Lucas F; Amorim, AndrÃ© M; Goldenberg, Renato\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe describe and illustrate three new species of Bertolonia , all endemic to the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil.

D.; Keithline, N.; Blum, C.; Cunningham, E.; Fromont, A.; Jorgensen, M.; Lee, R.; McBride, K.; Saez Berrios, P.; Harper, C.; Pellerin, L.; McPhee, D.; Ferguson, J. F.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Santo Domingo Basin, one of a series of basins within the Rio Grande Rift, is located between Santa Fe and Albuquerque, NM, and has been the focus of research by the Summer of Geophysical Experience (SAGE) program since 2000. Gravity, magnetotelluric (MT), and seismic data have been collected throughout the region, although we are concentrating on gravity and MT data collected during SAGE 2014 and 2015. The study area is located in the center of the Santo Domingo basin, an extensional, Miocene age, rift basin, in an area that was minimally involved in the preceding local Laramide orogenic activity. Rift sediments (~3.5 km thick) are underlain by Eocene age sediments that were shed from adjacent uplifts. Up to 3 km of Mesozoic and Paleozoic sediments are preserved above the Precambrian basement. Geologic outcrop, borehole and seismic reflection data, and known density values were used in the construction of a ~100 km-long, generalized geologic cross section from which a gravity response was calculated. The modeled gravity response makes fairly definitive predictions about the geometry of the basin as well as the stratigraphy and faulting within and bounding the basin. MT data was collected at ten stations within the basin. The MT sounding curves exhibit one-dimensional behavior at short periods (<10 s), not surprisingly considering the relatively flat local structure in the area. Layered-earth MT models, without geologic constraints, show a conductive (<10 ohm-m) layer at ~1.5 km above a more resistive layer (>1000 ohm-m) at ~ 3.5-4 km. Conductivities of the major stratigraphic units have been determined from well logs and previous MT modeling. Forward and inverse MT models constrained by the gravity-modeled geologic cross section are used to develop a conductivity model consistent with the geology, and are a step towards a better unified treatment of MT, seismic and gravity data.\n\nMean sea-level rise impacts on Santos Bay, Southeastern Brazil--physical modelling study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlfredini, Paolo; Arasaki, Emilia; do Amaral, RogÃ©rio Fernando\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe greenhouse effect and resulting increase in the Earth's temperature may accelerate the mean sea-level rise. The natural response of bays and estuaries to this rise, such as this case study of Santos Bay (Brazil), will include change in shoreline position, land flooding and wetlands impacts. The main impacts of this scenario were studied in a physical model built in the Coastal and Harbour Division of Hydraulic Laboratory, University of SÃ£o Paulo, and the main conclusions are presented in this paper. The model reproduces near 1,000 km(2) of the study area, including Santos, SÃ£o Vicente, Praia Grande, CubatÃ£o, GuarujÃ¡ and Bertioga cities.\n\nDeep structure of the Santos Basin-SÃ£o Paulo Plateau System, SE Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEvain, Mikael; Afilhado, Alexandra; Rigoti, Caesar; Loureiro, Afonso; Alves, Daniela; Klingelhoefer, Frauke; Schnurle, Philippe; Feld, Aurelie; Fuck, Reinhardt; Soares, Jose; Vinicius de Lima, Marcus; Corela, Carlos; Matias, Luis; Benabdellouahed, Massinissa; Baltzer, Agnes; Rabineau, Marina; Viana, Adriano; Moulin, Maryline; Aslanian, Daniel\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe structure and nature of the crust underlying the Santos Basin-SÃ£o Paulo Plateau System (SSPS), in the SE Brazilian margin, is discussed based on five wide-angle seismic profiles acquired during the SanBa experiment in 2011. Velocity models allow us to precisely divide the SSPS in six domains from unthinned continental crust (Domain CC) to normal oceanic crust (Domain OC). A seventh domain (Domain D), a triangular shape region in the SE of the SSPS, is discussed by [Klingelhoefer et al., GJI, 2014]â . Beneath the continental shelf, a ~100 km wide necking zone (Domain N) is imaged where continental crust thins abruptly from ~40 km to less than 15 km. Toward the ocean, most of the SSPS (Domain A and C) shows velocity ranges, velocity gradients and a Moho interface characteristic of thinned continental crust. The central domain (Domain B) has, however, a very heterogeneous structure. While its southwestern part still exhibits extremely thinned (7 km) continental crust, its northeastern part depicts a 2-4 km thick upper layer (6.0-6.5 km/s) overlying an anomalous velocity layer (7.0-7.8 km/s) and no evidence of a Moho interface. This structure is interpreted as atypical oceanic crust, exhumed lower crust or upper continental crust intruded by mafic material, overlying either altered mantle in the first two cases or intruded lower continental crust in the last case. The v-shaped structuration in this central domain confirms an initial episode of rifting within the SSPS oblique to the general opening direction of the South Atlantic central segment.\n\nHuman sporotrichosis beyond the epidemic front reveals classical transmission types in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Araujo, Mariceli L; Rodrigues, Anderson M; Fernandes, Geisa F; de Camargo, Zoilo P; de Hoog, G Sybren\n\n2015-08-01\n\nSporotrichosis has emerged as the main subcutaneous mycosis of humans and animals around the world. With particular differences in frequency, the major species includes Sporothrix brasiliensis, S. schenckii, S. globosa and S. luriei. In Brazil, the main aspect of this epidemic is based on the zoonotic transmission through the scratches and bites of diseased cats contaminated with S. brasiliensis. Areas free of feline sporotrichosis are poorly characterised in Brazil. We investigated by molecular tools the epidemiology of human sporotrichosis in the EspÃ­rito Santo (ES) state, an area adjacent to Rio de Janeiro where is the epicentre of the long-lasting outbreak of cat-transmitted sporotrichosis. The human cases in the ES state reveal the prevalence of classical transmission types where subjects are mainly infected by accidental traumatic inoculation during manipulation of contaminated plant material. In agreement with an environmental source, Sporothrix schenckii was the major aetiological agent in the classical transmission. Unlike Rio de Janeiro, this study shows that cat-transmitted epidemic in EspÃ­rito Santo is still scanty, although the geographic proximity and similar climatic features. Sporothrix brasiliensis was the agent in the feline-transmitted cases. Sporothrix globosa was isolated from a patient with fixed cutaneous lesions that did not report any contact with diseased animals. In conclusion, beyond the borders of Rio de Janeiro epidemic, agents of sporotrichosis in EspÃ­rito Santo show a scattered occurrence with high species diversity.

The Bauru Group provided an important portrait of the Brazilian Mesozoic terrestrial biota, which boasts a vertebrate fauna formed from fishes, frogs, lacertilians, crocodyliforms, dinosaurs and mammals; records of palynomorphs; and invertebrate fauna consisted of gastropods, bivalves, ostracods and conchostracans. Nevertheless, the age of these continental deposits is not precisely estimated, which prevents global correlations, and its fauna is argued to be endemic. The new specimen described is the first turtle from the Santo AnastÃ¡cio Formation, and its morphological comparison with other South American forms provided a significant advancement in the understanding of the age of this unit (Late Cretaceous). This study permitted a revision of the turtle taxa of the Bauru Group. As a result, some taxa were considered synonym, including the new Santo AnastÃ¡cio form. The specimen is still unnamed due to the absence of skull characters that preclude its accurate positioning within the Bauru Group skull-based taxa. In addition, the phylogenetic affinities of this taxon were analyzed into Podocnemidinura clade.\n\nThe Oldest Case of Decapitation in the New World (Lapa do Santo, East-Central Brazil).\n\nPubMed\n\nStrauss, AndrÃ©; Oliveira, Rodrigo Elias; Bernardo, Danilo V; Salazar-GarcÃ­a, Domingo C; Talamo, Sahra; Jaouen, Klervia; Hubbe, Mark; Black, Sue; Wilkinson, Caroline; Richards, Michael Phillip; Araujo, Astolfo G M; Kipnis, Renato; Neves, Walter Alves\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present here evidence for an early Holocene case of decapitation in the New World (Burial 26), found in the rock shelter of Lapa do Santo in 2007. Lapa do Santo is an archaeological site located in the Lagoa Santa karst in east-central Brazil with evidence of human occupation dating as far back as 11.7-12.7 cal kyBP (95.4% interval). An ultra-filtered AMS age determination on a fragment of the sphenoid provided an age range of 9.1-9.4 cal kyBP (95.4% interval) for Burial 26. The interment was composed of an articulated cranium, mandible and first six cervical vertebrae. Cut marks with a v-shaped profile were observed in the mandible and sixth cervical vertebra. The right hand was amputated and laid over the left side of the face with distal phalanges pointing to the chin and the left hand was amputated and laid over the right side of the face with distal phalanges pointing to the forehead. Strontium analysis comparing Burial 26's isotopic signature to other specimens from Lapa do Santo suggests this was a local member of the group. Therefore, we suggest a ritualized decapitation instead of trophy-taking, testifying for the sophistication of mortuary rituals among hunter-gatherers in the Americas during the early Archaic period. In the apparent absence of wealth goods or elaborated architecture, Lapa do Santo's inhabitants seemed to use the human body to express their cosmological principles regarding death.\n\nBathymetry, Chirp and Deep Crustal Structure of the Santos Basin SÃO Paulo Ridge Complex (sbspr)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAslanian, D.; Klingelhoefer, F.; Moulin, M.; Schnurle, P.; Rabineau, M.; Afilhado, A.; Roest, W.

A.; Paula Ribas, M.; De Lima, M.; Corela, C.; Duarte, J.; Matias, L. M.; OBS Team of Sanba Cruise\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe SanBa (Santos Basin- Seismic Research experiment) research experiment is a joint project of the Department of Marine Geosciences (IFREMER: Institut FranÃ§ais de Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la MER, France), the Laboratory of \"Oceanic Domain\" (Institut Universitaire et EuropÃ©en de la Mer, France), the Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa (Lattex and CGUL, Portugal), the Universidade de Brasilia (Brazil) and PETROBRAS. Its aim is to test hypotheses that have been proposed such as the existence of failed rift and a micro-block (Moulin et al., GSL submitted) or the presence of exhumed mantle on its south-eastern part (Zalan et al., AAPG 2009). Six wide-angle seismic data were acquired together with coincident deep frequency reflection seismic data during the SanBa cruise in Dec 2010 - Jan. 2011 (total > 850 Nm). Chirp and Bathymetry were also acquired during the cruise. The preliminary results suggest a very thin crust (< 5km) in the center and in the south-eastern part of the SBSPR. Both refraction and reflection data present a clear signal of the Moho in the distalmost part of the study area, which seems to preclude the exhumed mantle hypothesis.\"\n\nMetagenome Sequencing of Prokaryotic Microbiota Collected from Rivers in the Upper Amazon Basin.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos-JÃºnior, CÃ©lio Dias; Kishi, Luciano Takeshi; Toyama, Danyelle; Soares-Costa, Andrea; Oliveira, Tereza Cristina Souza; de Miranda, Fernando Pellon; Henrique-Silva, FlÃ¡vio\n\n2017-01-12\n\nTropical freshwater environments, like rivers, are important reservoirs of microbial life.

In addition, ticks were collected from these dogs. A mean of 4.4+/-3.0 dogs (range: 1-12) were sampled per household; 78 and 14 dogs were from rural and urban areas, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify fragments of the 18S rDNA gene of Babesia spp or Hepatozoon spp revealed amplicons of the expected size in 20 (21.7%) dogs for Babesia, and 54 (58.7%) dogs for Hepatozoon. All Babesia-positive dogs were also Hepatozoon-positive. Among the 21 households, 15 (71.4%) from 3 counties had at least one PCR-positive dog, including 13 farms (rural area) and 2 homes (urban area). A total of 40 PCR products from the Hepatozoon-PCR, and 19 products from the Babesia-PCR were submitted to DNA sequencing. All generated sequences from Hepatozoon-PCR were identical to each other, and to corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of H. canis in GenBank. Surprisingly, all generated sequences from the Babesia PCR were also identical to corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of H. canis in GenBank. Dogs from 10 rural and 2 urban households were found infested by Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Immature of Amblyomma cajennense ticks were found in dogs from only 4 rural households (also infested by R. sanguineus). All but one household with R. sanguineus-infested dogs had at least one Hepatozoon-infected dog. Statistical analysis showed that the presence of ticks (i.e. R. sanguineus) infesting dogs in the households was significantly (P<0.05) associated with at least one PCR-positive dog. There was no significant association (P>0.05) between PCR-positive dogs and urban or rural households. Canine hepatozoonosis caused by H. canis is a high frequent infection in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil, where it is possibly vectored by R. sanguineus. Since all infected dogs\n\nApplication of a geographical information system approach for risk analysis of fascioliasis in southern EspÃ­rito Santo state, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, Isabella Vilhena Freire; de Avelar, Barbara Rauta; Pereira, Maria Julia Salim; da Fonseca, Adevair Henrique\n\n2012-09-01\n\nA model based on geographical information systems for mapping the risk of fascioliasis was developed for the southern part of EspÃ­rito Santo state, Brazil. The determinants investigated were precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, soil type and land use. Weightings and grades were assigned to determinants and their categories according to their relevance with respect to fascioliasis. Theme maps depicting the spatial distribution of risk areas indicate that over 50% of southern EspÃ­rito Santo is either at high or at very high risk for fascioliasis. These areas were found to be characterized by comparatively high temperature but relatively low slope, low precipitation and low elevation corresponding to periodically flooded grasslands or soils that promote water retention.\n\nIntegrated quality assessment of sediments from harbour areas in Santos-SÃ£o Vicente Estuarine System, Southern Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuruaem, Lucas Moreira; de Castro, Ãtalo Braga; Hortellani, Marcos Antonio; Taniguchi, Satie; Fillmann, Gilberto; Sasaki, Silvio Tarou; Varella Petti, MÃ´nica AngÃ©lica; Sarkis, Jorge Eduardo de Souza; BÃ­cego, MÃ¡rcia Caruso; Maranho, Luciane Alves; Davanso, Marcela Bergo; Nonato, Edmundo Ferraz; Cesar, Augusto; Costa-Lotufo, Leticia Veras; Abessa, Denis Moledo de Souza\n\n2013-09-01\n\nSantos-SÃ£o Vicente Estuarine System is a highly populated coastal zone in Brazil and where it is located the major port of Latin America. Historically, port activities, industrial and domestic effluents discharges have constituted the main sources of contaminants to estuarine system. This study aimed to assess the recent status of sediment quality from 5 zones of Port of Santos by applying a lines-of-evidence approach through integrating results of: (1) acute toxicity of whole sediment and chronic toxicity of liquid phases; (2) grain size, organic matter, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, linear alkylbenzenes and butyltins; (3) benthic community descriptors. Results revealed a gradient of increasing contamination for metals and organic compounds, alongside with their geochemical carriers. Sediment liquid phases were more toxic compared to whole sediment. Low number of species and individuals indicated the impoverishment of benthic community. The use of site-specific sediment quality guidelines was more appropriate to predict sediment toxicity. The integration of results through Sediment Quality Triad approach and principal component analysis allowed observing the effects of natural stressors and dredging on sediment quality and benthic distribution. Even with recent governmental efforts to control, pollution is still relevant in Port of Santos and a threat to local ecosystems.\n\nPareiorhaphis vetula, a new armored catfish from the headwaters of the Rio Doce basin, Brazil (Siluriformes: Loricariidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nPereira, Edson H L; Lehmann, Pablo A; Reis, Roberto E\n\n2016-07-28\n\nA new species of Pareiorhaphis is described from the upper Rio Doce basin. The description is based on a series of specimens recently collected in small headwater tributaries to the Rio GuanhÃ£es, a tributary of the Rio Santo Antonio, left bank of the Rio Doce in Minas Gerais State, eastern Brazil. Pareiorhaphis vetula, new species, is a small loricariid catfish with dark brown spots irregularly scattered over a brown background on the dorsal surface of body and along flanks. The new species differs from all other Pareiorhaphis species by having the maxillary barbel completely adnate to the lower lip and by adult males possessing a particularly elongate, sharply pointed, conical urogenital papilla. In addition, Pareiorhaphis vetula is further distinguished from most congeners by having a shorter pelvic-fin spine, or by possessing more numerous premaxillary teeth, and by lacking a dorsal-fin spinelet. A comparison with congeners P. nasuta, P. scutula and P. proskynita, which also occur in headwater streams of the Rio Doce basin is also presented.\n\nMale-specific contributions to the Brazilian population of Espirito Santo.\n\nPubMed\n\nde F Figueiredo, Raquel; Ambrosio, Isabela B; Braganholi, Danilo F; Chemale, Gustavo; Martins, Joyce A; Gomes, Veronica; GusmÃ£o, Leonor; Cicarelli, Regina M B\n\n2016-05-01\n\nY chromosome markers have been widely studied due to their various applications in the fields of forensic and evolutionary genetics. In this study, 35 Y-SNPs and 17 Y-STRs were genotyped in 253 males from the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. A total of 18 haplogroups and 243 haplotypes were detected; the haplogroup and haplotype diversities were 0.7794 and 0.9997, respectively. Genetic distance analysis using the Y-STR data showed no statistically significant differences between Espirito Santo and other admixed populations from Brazil. The classification of paternal lineages based on haplogroups showed a predominant European contribution (85.88%), followed by African (11.37%) and Amerindian (2.75%) contributions.\n\nThe Oldest Case of Decapitation in the New World (Lapa do Santo, East-Central Brazil)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nStrauss, AndrÃ©; Oliveira, Rodrigo Elias; Bernardo, Danilo V.; Salazar-GarcÃ­a, Domingo C.; Talamo, Sahra; Jaouen, Klervia; Hubbe, Mark; Black, Sue; Wilkinson, Caroline; Richards, Michael Phillip; Araujo, Astolfo G. M.; Kipnis, Renato; Neves, Walter Alves\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present here evidence for an early Holocene case of decapitation in the New World (Burial 26), found in the rock shelter of Lapa do Santo in 2007. Lapa do Santo is an archaeological site located in the Lagoa Santa karst in east-central Brazil with evidence of human occupation dating as far back as 11.7â12.7 cal kyBP (95.4% interval). An ultra-filtered AMS age determination on a fragment of the sphenoid provided an age range of 9.1â9.4 cal kyBP (95.4% interval) for Burial 26. The interment was composed of an articulated cranium, mandible and first six cervical vertebrae. Cut marks with a v-shaped profile were observed in the mandible and sixth cervical vertebra. The right hand was amputated and laid over the left side of the face with distal phalanges pointing to the chin and the left hand was amputated and laid over the right side of the face with distal phalanges pointing to the forehead. Strontium analysis comparing Burial 26âs isotopic signature to other specimens from Lapa do Santo suggests this was a local member of the group. Therefore, we suggest a ritualized decapitation instead of trophy-taking, testifying for the sophistication of mortuary rituals among hunter-gatherers in the Americas during the early Archaic period. In the apparent absence of wealth goods or elaborated architecture, Lapa do Santoâs inhabitants seemed to use the human body to express their cosmological principles regarding death.

We mapped three distinct MTDs and several fault families on the continental slope of EspÃ­rito Santo, SE Brazil. Fault mapping was based on seismic attributes such as seismic coherence and structural smoothing, and was further completed using ant tracking algorithms. Genetically related fault families were analysed in terms of their throw-depth (t-z) and throw-distance (t-x) gradient curves. A key result in this paper is that vertical fault propagation can be hindered by MTDs, as demonstrated for Eocene to Early Miocene faults in parts of the study area. Throw-depth variations in faults affected by MTDs are associated with: a) lithologic controls resulting from the presence of MTDs, b) local fault segmentation and c) reactivation by dip linkage. Based on their orientation and degree of interaction with MTDs, interpreted faults can be classified as decoupled and non-decoupled. Importantly, faults decoupled by MTDs have quasi-elliptical t-x profiles and show smaller cumulative throw values and fault propagation rates when compared to their non-decoupled counterparts. Recurrent MTDs can therefore be used as markers to estimate structural decoupling between distinct fault families.\n\nRisk factors associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFregona, Geisa; Cosme, Lorrayne Belique; Moreira, ClÃ¡udia Maria Marques; Bussular, JosÃ© Luis; Dettoni, ValdÃ©rio do Valle; Dalcolmo, Margareth Pretti; Zandonade, Eliana; Maciel, Ethel Leonor Noia\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To analyze the prevalence and factors associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study of cases of tuberculosis tested for first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin) in EspÃ­rito Santo between 2002 and 2012. We have used laboratory data and registration of cases of tuberculosis â from the Sistema Nacional de Agravos de NotificaÃ§Ã£o and Sistema para Tratamentos Especiais de Tuberculose. Individuals have been classified as resistant and non-resistant and compared in relation to the sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables. Some variables have been included in a logistic regression model to establish the factors associated with resistance. RESULTS In the study period, 1,669 individuals underwent anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Of these individuals, 10.6% showed resistance to any anti-tuberculosis drug. The rate of multidrug resistance observed, that is, to rifampicin and isoniazid, has been 5%. After multiple analysis, we have identified as independent factors associated with resistant tuberculosis: history of previous treatment of tuberculosis [recurrence (OR = 7.72; 95%CI 4.24â14.05) and re-entry after abandonment (OR = 3.91; 95%CI 1.81â8.43)], smoking (OR = 3.93; 95%CI 1.98â7.79), and positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis at the time of notification of the case (OR = 3.22; 95%CI 1.15â8.99). CONCLUSIONS The partnership between tuberculosis control programs and health teams working in the network of Primary Health Care needs to be strengthened. This would allow the identification and monitoring of individuals with a history of previous treatment of tuberculosis and smoking. Moreover, the expansion of the offer of the culture of tuberculosis and anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing would provide greater diagnostic capacity for the resistant types in EspÃ­rito Santo.

The article highlights dos Santos's training and her work in the ServiÃ§o Especial de SaÃºde PÃºblica (SESP- Special Public Health Service), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and in the formulation and implementation of national training programs for human resources within the area of health from the late 1970s onwards. The article highlights dos Santos's central role in the formulation and implementation of training policies for health workers, especially nursing technicians and assistants, and demonstrates how she occupies an important place in the history of Brazilian public health.\n\nThe Cerrillos Uplift, the La Bajada Constriction, and Hydrogeologic Framework of the Santo Domingo Basin, Rio Grande Rift, New Mexico\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMinor, Scott A.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe geologic, geophysical, and hydrogeologic properties of the La Bajada constriction and Santo Domingo Basin, northern New Mexico, result from tectonic and volcanic processes of the late Tertiary and Quaternary Rio Grande rift. An integrated geologic and geophysical assessment in the La Bajada constriction allows development of a geologic framework that can provide input for regional ground-water flow models. These models then can provide better estimates of future water supplies in a region that largely subsists on aquifers in Rio Grande rift basins. The combination of surface geologic investigations (stratigraphic and structural studies; chapters A, B, C, and E), airborne geophysics (aeromagnetic and time-domain electromagnetic surveys; chapters D and F), ground geophysical measurements (gravity and magnetotelluric surveys; chapters D and F), and data from the few wells in the area (chapter G) provides new constraints on the hydrogeologic framework of this area. Summary results of our investigations are synthesized in chapter G. Through-going aquifers consisting of ancestral Rio Grande axial-river sand and gravel and of coarse western-piedmont gravel form the predominant ground-water pathways through the partly buried structural trough defining the La Bajada constriction between Espa?ola and Santo Domingo Basins. Thick, clay-rich Cretaceous marine shales of low hydraulic conductivity form a pervasive regional confining unit within the Cerrillos uplift on the southeast flank of the constriction. Numerous, dominantly north-northwest-striking, intrabasin faults that project part way across the La Bajada constriction create a matrix of laterally and vertically variable hydrogeologic compartments that locally partition and deflect ground-water flow parallel to faults.\n\nDesign and skill assessment of an Operational Forecasting System for currents and sea level variability to the Santos Estuarine System - Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGodoi Rezende Costa, C.; Castro, B. M.; Blumberg, A. F.; Leite, J. R. B., Sr.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSantos City is subject to an average of 12 storm tide events per year. Such events bring coastal flooding able to threat human life and damage coastal infrastructure. Severe events have forced the interruption of ferry boat services and ship traffic through Santos Harbor, causing great impacts to Santos Port, the largest in South America, activities. Several studies have focused on the hydrodynamics of storm tide events but only a few of those studies have pursued an operational initiative to predict short term (< 3 days) sea level variability. The goals of this study are (i) to describe the design of an operational forecasting system built to predict sea surface elevation and currents in the Santos Estuarine System and (ii) to evaluate model performance in simulating observed sea surface elevation. The Santos Operational Forecasting System (SOFS) hydrodynamic module is based on the Stevens Institute Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Model (sECOM). The fully automated SOFS is designed to provide up to 71 h forecast of sea surface elevations and currents every day. The system automatically collects results from global models to run the SOFS nested into another sECOM based model for the South Brazil Bight (SBB). Global forecasting results used to force both models come from Mercator Ocean, released by Copernicus Marine Service, and from the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (BRAMS) stablished by the Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies (with Portuguese acronym CPTEC). The complete routines task take about 8 hours of run time to finish. SOFS was able to hindcast a severe storm tide event that took place in Santos on August 21-22, 2016. Comparisons with observed sea level provided skills of 0.92 and maximum root mean square errors of 25 cm. The good agreement with observed data shows the potential of the designed system to predict storm tides and to support both human and assets protection.\n\nA new species of Pseudopaludicola (Anura, Leiuperinae) from EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaldo, Diego; Pupin, Nadya; Gasparini, JoÃ£o Luiz; Baptista Haddad, CÃ©lio F.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe describe a new anuran species of the genus Pseudopaludicola that inhabits sandy areas in resting as associated to the Atlantic Forest biome in the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil. The new species is characterized by: SVL 11.7â14.6 mm in males, 14.0â16.7Â mm in females; body slender; fingertips knobbed, with a central groove; hindlimbs short; abdominal fold complete; arytenoid cartilages wide; prepollex with base and two segments; prehallux with base and one segment; frontoparietal fontanelle partially exposed; advertisement call with one note composed of two isolated pulses per call; call dominant frequency ranging 4,380â4,884 Hz; diploid chromosome number 22; and Ag-NORs on 8q subterminal. In addition, its 16S rDNA sequence shows high genetic distances when compared to sequences of related species, which provides strong evidence that the new species is an independent lineage.

Morbidity and mortality data were collected from official documents and from Health Information Systems. In parallel, the diseases reported in the two major newspapers of EspÃ­rito Santo in 2011-2012 were identified from 10,771 news articles. Concomitantly, eight interviews were conducted with reporters from the two newspapers to understand the journalists' reasons for the coverage or neglect of certain health/disease topics. Quantitatively, the DNMs identified diseases associated with poverty, including tuberculosis, leprosy, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and trachoma. Apart from these, diseases with outbreaks in the period evaluated, including whooping cough and meningitis, some cancers, respiratory diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke, were also seldom addressed by the media. In contrast, dengue fever, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, tracheal cancer, and bronchial and lung cancers were broadly covered in the period analysed, corroborating the tradition of media disclosure of these diseases. Qualitatively, the DNMs included rare diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), leishmaniasis, Down syndrome, and verminoses. The reasons for the neglect of these topics by the media included the political and economic interests of the newspapers, their editorial line, and the organizational routine of the newsrooms.

Possible involvement has been discussed on atmospheric circulation in distributing the volatile pollutant. We developed a portable air sampler for the collection of mercury compounds and determined atmospheric mercury concentrations at several sites in Brazil including the basin of the Amazon tributaries. The mean concentration of total mercury was between 9.1 and 14.0 ng/m(3) in the basin of the UatumÃ£ River located in the tropical rain forest far from goldmining sites and from urbanized area. These mercury levels exceeded the background level previously reported in rural area and, furthermore, were higher than concentrations observed in Rio de Janeiro and in Manaus that were compatible with the reference values for urban area. Mercury concentrations were also determined in gold refineries in the basin of the Tapajos River, and detected at a significant but not a health deteriorating level. Although only preliminary data were available, the present observations were in favor of the hypothesis that mercury is distributed widely by long distant transport by the atmospheric circulation after released at gold mining sites.\n\nSpatiotemporal appraisal of TBT contamination and imposex along a tropical bay (Todos os Santos Bay, Brazil).\n\nPubMed\n\nArtifon, Vanda; Castro, Ãtalo Braga; Fillmann, Gilberto\n\n2016-08-01\n\nA spatiotemporal evaluation of butyltin contamination was performed between 2010 and 2012 along Todos os Santos Bay (Northeast Brazil) using surface sediments, bivalve tissues (Anomalocardia brasiliana and Mytella guyanensis), and imposex occurrence (Stramonita rustica). The spatial study detected high tributyltin (TBT) levels (maximum values of 262 ng Sn g (-1) -Â 21,833Â ng SnÂ g(-1) of total organic carbon - for surface sediments and 421Â ng SnÂ g(-1) for bivalve tissues) in the innermost part of the bay. The TBT levels detected in M. guyanensis tissues might cause human health risk since local population consumes these organisms. These high concentrations observed in the bivalves might result in ingestions higher than the safe limits established by European Food Safety Authority (250Â ng TBTÂ kg(-1)Â day(-1)). Considering the temporal evaluation, no difference (pâ>â0.05) was observed between TBT concentrations in sediments obtained during the two sampling campaigns (2010/2011 and 2012). However, the increasing predominance of TBT metabolites (butyltin degradation index (BDI) >1) in more recent sediments indicates further degradation of old TBT inputs. In spite of that, recent inputs are still evident at this region. Nevertheless, a reduction of imposex parameters in S. rustica over the last decade suggests an overall decline in the TBT contamination, at least in the outermost and possible less impacted region of the bay. The TBT contamination is probably reducing due to the national and international legislative restrictions on the use of TBT as antifouling biocide. The contamination levels, however, are still relevant especially in the inner part of Todos os Santos Bay since they are above those that are likely to cause toxicity to the biota.\n\nThe Paleozoic ichthyofauna of the Amazonas and ParnaÃ­ba basins, Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFigueroa, Rodrigo Tinoco; Machado, Deusana Maria da Costa\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe Brazilian Paleozoic ichthyofauna from the ParnaÃ­ba and Amazonas basins regard a sparsely known diversity, including chondrichthyans and acanthodians, besides some osteichthyan remains. This work proposes a revision of the fossil material from these two sedimentary basins and synthesizes the morphological aspect of such material trying to understand the influences of those fossils to the paleontology of the region, comparing the Brazilian fossils with other gondwanan faunas. The Brazilian Paleozoic fish fauna shows great resemblance to those of Bolivia, especially during the Devonian. Many of the Acanthodian spines from the Manacapuru Formation (Amazonas Basin), and the Pimenteira Formation (ParnaÃ­ba Basin), are comparable to the taxa found in Bolivia. The lack of more Placoderm remains in the Brazilian outcrops is similar to the low diversity of this group in Bolivia, when compared to other South American and Euramerican localities. The most diverse Brazilian ichthyofauna is encountered in the Permian Pedra de Fogo Formation where numerous chondrichthyans and 'paleopterygians' remains are found, together with dipnoans and actinistians. Despite the apparent lack of more representative Paleozoic ichthyofaunas in Brazil, the available material that ranges from Lower Devonian to early Permian from Brazil bears important taxa that could address valuable taxonomic and biogeographic informations.\n\nPolymorphic genetic variation in immune system genes: a study of two populations of Espirito Santo, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nDettogni, Raquel SpinassÃ©; SÃ¡, Ricardo TristÃ£o; Tovar, ThaÃ­s TristÃ£o; Louro, IÃºri Drumond\n\n2013-08-01\n\nMapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes potentially involved in immune responses may help understand the pathophysiology of infectious diseases in specific geographical regions. In this context, we have aimed to analyze the frequency of immunogenetic markers, focusing on genes CD209 (SNP -336A/G), FCÎ³RIIa (SNP -131H/R), TNF-Î± (SNP -308A/G) and VDR (SNP Taq I) in two populations of the Espirito Santo State (ES), Brazil: general and Pomeranian populations. Peripheral blood genomic DNA was extracted from one hundred healthy individuals of the general population and from 59 Pomeranians. Polymorphic variant identification was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). SNP genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. There was no statistically significant difference in allelic and genotypic distributions between the two populations studied. Statistically significant differences were observed for SNP genotype distribution in genes CD209, TNF-Î± and VDR when comparing the ES populations with other Brazilian populations. This is the first report of CD209, FcÎ³RIIa, TNF-Î± and VDR allelic frequencies for the general and Pomeranian populations of ES.\n\nImaging exhumed lower continental crust in the distal Jequitinhonha basin, Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLoureiro, A.; SchnÃ¼rle, P.; KlingelhÃ¶fer, F.; Afilhado, A.; Pinheiro, J.; Evain, M.; Gallais, F.; Dias, N.

Profiles SL11 and SL12 image the Jequitinhonha basin, perpendicularly to the coast, with 15 and 11 four-channel ocean-bottom seismometers, respectively. Profile SL10 runs parallel to the coast, crossing profiles SL11 and SL12, imaging the proximal Jequitinhonha and Almada basins with 17 ocean-bottom seismometers. Forward modelling, combined with pre-stack depth migration to increase the horizontal resolution of the velocity models, indicates that sediment thickness varies between 3.3 km and 6.2 km in the distal basin. Crustal thickness at the western edge of the profiles is of around 20 km, with velocity gradients indicating a continental origin. It decreases to less than 5 km in the distal basin, with high seismic velocities and gradients, not compatible with normal oceanic crust nor exhumed upper mantle. Typical oceanic crust is never imaged along these about 200 km-long profiles and we propose that the transitional crust in the Jequitinhonha basin is a made of exhumed lower continental crust.\n\nConceptions of health, illness and treatment of patients who use homeopathy in Santos, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatriani Justo, C M; DÃ© Andrea Gomes, Mara H\n\n2008-01-01\n\nTo investigate the conceptions of health and illness, the reasons for seeking homeopathy and continuing treatment, compliance and the meaning of the relationship between religiosity and health for patients who adhere to homeopathy. A qualitative study of 20 adult patients in Santos (Brazil) treated by homeopaths in the public and private sector for at least 2 years. Semi-structured interviews, organized by predefined thematic categories, the content of the interviews was analyzed. The conceptions of health and illness of the interviewed patients are related to the idea of vital balance/imbalance mediated by body-mind interaction. Dissatisfaction with conventional treatment, family influence and suggestions of others were the reasons for seeking homeopathic treatment. Patients continued homeopathic treatment due to positive therapeutic results, cure without being aggressive to the organism, the holistic integrated approach, the preventive nature of the treatment and low prices of medicine. For these patients, the availability of homeopathy in the public health sector extends the possibility of access. The need for a wider dissemination of homeopathy and the difficulties in following the prescription are the main problems involved in continuing treatment. Faith is an important component. We found a correlation between the conceptions of health and illness and the principles of homeopathy, assimilated through a strong bond between patients and the homeopathic practitioners. To investigate the beliefs, values and meanings that patients attribute to homeopathy helps to understand subjective aspects that may interfere with treatment compliance.\n\nIndividual determinants of fish choosing in open-air street markets from Santo AndrÃ©, SP/Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nVasconcellos, Juliana Parreira; Vasconcellos, Silvio Arruda; Pinheiro, Sonia Regina; de Oliveira, ThaÃ­s Helena Nishikata; Ribeiro, Naassom Almeida Souza; Martins, Cassia Neves; PorfÃ­rio, Bruno Augusti; Sanches, Sandra Abelardo; de Souza, Orlando Bispo; Telles, Evelise Oliveira; Balian, Simone de Carvalho\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to identify the determinants of fish consumption in the population that attends open-air street markets in the city of Santo AndrÃ©, SP, Brazil.We performed a survey, covering approximately 482 people in 49 street markets.It consisted of free-answer questions, half open choice and half multiple-choice options, for the identification and evaluation of socioeconomic factors that facilitate and hinder fish consumption.A descriptive analysis of the data and further tests were used to determine the association between variables and linearity with consumption, with a significance level of 5%. The most commonly cited types of fish consumed were hake, sardine and dogfish. The factors that facilitate the purchase and consumption of fish are listed as follows: a preference for purchasing fish at street markets, appearance, firmness, fresh presentation, frozen presentation, as well as the respondent's education and individual monthly income. Limiting factors were identified as the price and the presence of spines. Perishability, odour, ethnicity, proximity to points of sale of residence and work, gender, age, number of people in the household, presence of children and acquisition supermarket were not characteristics that influenced decisions about fish consumption.

It is part of the GuaÃ­ba basin, has an area of approximately 800 km 2 and contains 32 counties. The basin provides drinking water for 1.6 million inhabitants in one of the most important industrial centres in Brazil. This study describes different water quality indices (WQI) used for the sub-basins of three important streams in the SRB: Pampa, EstÃ¢ncia Velha/PortÃ£o and Schmidt streams. Physical, chemical and microbiological parameters assessed bimonthly using samples collected at each stream source were used to calculate the Horton Index (HI), the Dinius Index (DI) and the water quality index adopted by the US National Sanitation Foundation (NSF WQI) in the additive and multiplicative forms. These indices describe mean water quality levels at the streams sources. The results obtained for these 3 indexes showed a worrying scenario in which water quality has already been negatively affected at the sites where three important sub-basins in the Sinos River Basin begin to form.\n\nMigratory flows and foraging habitat selection by shorebirds along the northeastern coast of Brazil: The case of BaÃ­a de Todos os Santos\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLunardi, Vitor O.; Macedo, Regina H.; Granadeiro, JosÃ© P.; Palmeirim, Jorge M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLarge numbers of Nearctic shorebirds migrate and winter along the coast of northeastern Brazil, but there is little information on their migratory flows, foraging ecology, and on the structure of the species assemblages that they form with resident shorebirds. We studied these issues on intertidal flats of BaÃ­a de Todos os Santos (Bahia), the second largest bay in Brazil. During a full year cycle we carried out weekly bird counts in an intertidal area of 280 ha divided in sectors, where we also measured environmental parameters. The analyses of weekly counts resulted in a detailed phenology of use of the area by shorebirds. Five species were resident and ten were Nearctic migrants. Several of the latter had clear peaks in numbers in March and October, revealing the use of the bay as a stopover during both the north-bound and south-bound migration flows. A canonical correspondence analysis of the relationship between environmental parameters and bird numbers indicated that the foraging bird assemblage could be divided into five main groups, occupying distinct ecological gradients in the study area. The most important factors driving this structure were invertebrate prey abundance, percentage of fine sediments, area of mangrove cover and distance to channels. Our findings imply that maintenance of the diversity of intertidal habitats in this bay is crucial to satisfy the particular habitat requirements of resident and migrant shorebirds using the northeastern coastal regions of Brazil.\n\nThermochronological evidence for polyphase post-rift reactivation in SE Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCognÃ©, N.; Gallagher, K.; Cobbold, P.

The synchronicity of the cooling phases with tectonic pulses in the Andes and in NE Brazil, as well as the tectonic setting of the Tertiary basins (CognÃ© et al., submitted) lead us to attribute these phases to a plate-wide compressive stress, which reactivated inherited structures during the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary. The relief of the margin is therefore due, more to polyphase post-rift reactivation and uplift, than to rifting itself. - Cobbold, P.R., Meisling, K.E., Mount, V.S., 2001.

In the present study, such hydrodynamic processes and associated deposits have been investigated in a coastal embayment located along the southeast coast of Brazil, i.e. EspÃ­rito Santo Bay, in the winter (June/July) of 2008. The bay has undergone a series of human interventions that have altered the local hydrodynamic processes and, consequently, the sediment transport patterns. Facies distribution and sediment dynamics were examined by acoustic seabed mapping, sediment and core sampling, hydrodynamic measurements and sand transport modelling. The results show that sediment distribution can be described in terms of nearshore and offshore zones. The offshore bay sector is predominantly composed of \"palimpsest\" lithoclastic medium-coarse sands deposited in the course of the early Holocene transgression that peaked about 5,000 years ago. In the inner bay or nearshore zone (up to depths of 4-8 m), these older transgressive deposits are today overlain by a thin (up to 30-cm-thick) and partly patchy blanket of younger regressive fine sand/muddy fine sands. Both coarse- and fine-grained facies are being reworked during high-energy events (Hs>1.5 m) when fine sediment is resuspended, weak tide-induced drift currents causing the sand patches to be displaced. The coarser sediment, by contrast, is mobilized as bedload to produce wave ripples with spacings of up to 1.2 m. These processes lead to a sharp spatial delimitation between a fine sand/mud facies and a rippled coarse sand facies. The fine sand patches have a relief of about 20-30 cm and reveal a typical internal tempestite depositional sequence. Fair-weather wave-induced sediment transport (Hs<1 m), supported by weak tidal currents, seems to only affect the fine sediment facies. Sediment dynamics in EspÃ­rito Santo Bay is thus essentially controlled by\n\nMarine debris contamination along undeveloped tropical beaches from northeast Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantos, Isaac R; Friedrich, Ana ClÃ¡udia; Ivar do Sul, Juliana AssunÃ§Ã£o\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe hypothesize that floating debris leaving polluted coastal bays accumulate on nearby pristine beaches. We examined composition, quantities and distribution of marine debris along approximately 150 km of relatively undeveloped, tropical beaches in Costa do DendÃª (Bahia, Brazil). The study site is located south of Salvador City, the largest urban settlement from NE Brazil. Strong spatial variations were observed. Plastics accounted for 76% of the sampled items, followed by styrofoam (14%). Small plastic fragments resultant from the breakdown of larger items are ubiquitous all over the area. Because the dominant littoral drift in Bahia is southward, average beach debris densities (9.1 items/m) along Costa do DendÃª were threefold higher than densities previously observed north of Salvador City. River-dominated and stable beaches had higher debris quantities than unstable, erosional beaches. Areas immediately south of the major regional embayments (Camamu and Todos os Santos) were the preferential accumulation sites, indicating that rivers draining populous areas are the major source of debris to the study site. Our results provide baseline information for future assessments. Management actions should focus on input prevention at the hydrographic basin level rather than on cleaning services on beaches.\n\nCharacterization of the lead smelter slag in Santo Amaro, Bahia, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nLima, L R P de Andrade; Bernardez, L A\n\n2011-05-30\n\nFor 33 years, a primary lead smelter operated in Santo Amaro (Brazil). Since the 1970s, large amounts of Pb and Cd have been widely documented in the blood and hair of people living near the smelter. The plant closed down in 1993, and several years later, the Pb levels in the blood of children under 4 years of age living near the smelter were high, where the disposed lead slag was suspected to be the main source of this contamination. The objective of this study is to elucidate the source of the Pb contamination and any other potentially toxic contamination, focusing on the characterization of the slag. The samples used for this characterization study were taken from the slag heaps. The results of the chemical analysis showed that the major constituents of the slag, in decreasing order of wt%, were the following: Fe(2)O(3) (28.10), CaO (23.11), SiO(2) (21.39), ZnO (9.47), MgO (5.44), PbO (4.06), Al(2)O(3) (3.56), C (2.26), MnO (1.44), Na(2)O (0.27), S (0.37), K(2)O (0.26), and TiO(2) (0.25). The Cd content of the slag was 57.3mg/kg, which is relatively low. The X-ray diffraction and the electron probe microanalyzer X-ray mapping indicated that the major phases in the slag were wÃ¼stite, olivine, kirschsteinite, and franklinite. Only spheroidal metallic Pb was found in the slag. The leaching study showed that the slag was stable at a pH greater than 2.8, and only in an extremely acidic environment was the solubilization of the Pb enhanced significantly. The solubilization of Zn was very limited in the acidic and alkaline environments. These results can be explained by the limited leachability of the metallic Pb and Zn-bearing compounds. The leaching study used TCLP, SPLP, and SWEP and indicated that the lead slag was stable in weak acidic environments for short contact times. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Most cases of HH have been linked to mutations in genes associated with iron homeostasis. There have been three major variants in the high Fe (HFE) gene associated with the disease: C282Y, H63D and S65C. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the polymorphic variants (C282Y, H63D and S65C) of the HFE gene in the population of the EspÃ­rito Santo State (ES), Brazil by analyzing three different groups: general population (N = 120), Pomeranian descendants (N = 59), and patients with HH (N = 20). Using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, polymorphic variant identification was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Statistically significant differences were observed for genotype distribution of C282Y (P < 0.001) and H63D (P = 0.013) between the general population and the patients diagnosed with HH. This is the first study to analyze HFE gene allele frequencies for the general population, Pomeranian subpopulation, and patients with HH of ES, Brazil.\n\nEtiology of liver cirrhosis in Brazil: chronic alcoholism and hepatitis viruses in liver cirrhosis diagnosed in the state of EspÃ­rito Santo.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonÃ§alves, Patricia Lofego; Zago-Gomes, Maria da Penha; Marques, Carla Couzi; MendonÃ§a, Ana Tereza; GonÃ§alves, Carlos Sandoval; Pereira, Fausto Edmundo Lima\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo report the etiology of liver cirrhosis cases diagnosed at the University Hospital in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil. The medical charts of patients with liver cirrhosis who presented to the University Hospital in Vitoria were reviewed. Chronic alcoholism and the presence of hepatitis B or C infections (HBV and HCV, respectively) were pursued in all cases. The sample consisted of 1,516 cases (male:female ratio 3.5:1, aged 53.2 Â± 12.6 years). The following main etiological factors were observed: chronic alcoholism alone (39.7%), chronic alcoholism in association with HBV or HCV (16.1 %), HCV alone (14.5%) and in association with alcoholism (8.6%) (total, 23.1 %), and HBV alone (13.1%) and in association with alcoholism (7.5%, total 20.6%). The remaining etiologies included cryptogenic cases (9.8%) and other causes (6.0%). The mean patient age was lower and the male-to-female ratio was higher in the cirrhosis cases that were associated with alcoholism or HBV compared with other causes. Intravenous drug abuse and a history of surgery or blood transfusion were significantly associated with HCV infection. Hepatocellular carcinoma was present at the time of diagnosis in 15.4% of cases. Chronic alcoholism associated with HCV infection was significantly associated (p<0.001) with reduced age (at the time of cirrhosis diagnosis) and increased prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (p = 0.052). Alcoholism, HCV and HBV are the main factors associated with liver cirrhosis in the state of Espirito Santo. Chronic alcoholism associated with HCV infection reduced the age of patients at the time of liver cirrhosis diagnosis.\n\nHow Pecten Brazil drilled the Amazon basin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBleakley, W.B.\n\n1983-09-01\n\nPecten Brazil overcame numerous obstacles to drill two exploratory wells in the Amazon Basin last year. These included: The threat of low water in normally navigable rivers. Dense jungle growth at both locations. Lack of suitable roads for heavy hauling. Inconvenient distances from supply points. An unusual basalt formation responsible for unique drilling problems. Hundreds of helicopter lifts to move drilling rigs, supplies, and personnel. Pecten contracted with Petrobras, the Brazilian national oil company, to evaluate three blocks in the Amazon jungle, each about 68 miles (110 km) on a side, through seismic study and ultimate drilling. Planning for themoreÂ Â» drilling phase got started on March 17, 1981 with December 1 targeted as spud date for the first well. Actual spud date was November 25, 5 days ahead of schedule, in spite of all obstacles. Pecten has a mid-Amazonas block now under seismic investigation for possible exploratory drilling. Logistics problems in this one provide new difficulties, as the area is extremely wet. Most work is carried on by boat. The company is also looking offshore Bahia, testing the possible extension of the Renconcavo basin. Two wells have already provided good shows of a high pour point oil, with flow rates from 400 to 1,000 b/d. Another area of interest to Pecten is offshore Rio Grande do Norte.Â«Â less\n\nBackwater effects in the Amazon River basin of Brazil\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMeade, R.H.; Rayol, J.M.; Da Conceicao, S.C.; Natividade, J.R.G.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe Amazon River mainstem of Brazil is so regulated by differences in the timing of tributary inputs and by seasonal storage of water on floodplains that maximum discharges exceed minimum discharges by a factor of only 3. Large tributaries that drain the southern Amazon River basin reach their peak discharges two months earlier than does the mainstem. The resulting backwater in the lowermost 800 km of two large southern tributaries, the Madeira and Puru??s rivers, causes falling river stages to be as much as 2-3 m higher than rising stages at any given discharge. Large tributaries that drain the northernmost Amazon River basin reach their annual minimum discharges three to four months later than does the mainstem. In the lowermost 300-400 km of the Negro River, the largest northern tributary and the fifth largest river in the world, the lowest stages of the year correspond to those of the Amazon River mainstem rather than to those in the upstream reaches of the Negro River. ?? 1991 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.\n\nEvolution and palaeoenvironment of the Bauru Basin (Upper Cretaceous, Brazil)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFernandes, Luiz Alberto; MagalhÃ£es Ribeiro, Claudia Maria\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe Bauru Basin was one of the great Cretaceous desert basins of the world, evolved in arid zone called Southern Hot Arid Belt. Its paleobiological record consists mainly of dinosaurs, crocodiles and turtles. The Bauru Basin is an extensive region of the South American continent that includes parts of the southeast and south of Brazil, covering an area of 370,000 km2. It is an interior continental basin that developed as a result of subsidence of the central-southern part of the South-American Platform during the Late Cretaceous (Coniacian-Maastrichtian). This sag basin is filled by a sandy siliciclastic sequence with a preserved maximum thickness of 480 m, deposited in semiarid to desert conditions. Its basement consists of volcanic rocks (mainly basalts) of the Lower Cretaceous (Hauterivian) Serra Geral basalt flows, of the ParanÃ¡-Etendeka Continental Flood Basalt Province. The sag basin was filled by an essentially siliciclastic psammitic sequence. In lithostratigraphic terms the sequence consists of the CaiuÃ¡ and Bauru groups. The northern and northeastern edges of the basin provide a record of more proximal original deposits, such as associations of conglomeratic sand facies from alluvial fans, lakes, and intertwined distributary river systems. The progressive basin filling led to the burial of the basaltic substrate by extensive blanket sand sheets, associated with deposits of small dunes and small shallow lakes that retained mud (such as loess). Also in this intermediate context between the edges (more humid) and the interior (dry), wide sand sheet areas crossed by unconfined desert rivers (wadis) occurred. In the central axis of the elliptical basin a regional drainage system formed, flowing from northeast to southwest between the edges of the basin and the hot and dry inner periphery of the CaiuÃ¡ desert (southwest). Life in the Bauru Basin flourished most in the areas with the greatest water availability, in which dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, fish\n\n[Malaria and hematological aspects among residents to be impacted by reservoirs for the Santo AntÃ´nio and Jirau Hydroelectric Power Stations, RondÃ´nia State, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nKatsuragawa, Tony Hiroshi; Cunha, Roberto Penna de Almeida; de Souza, Daniele Cristina Apoluceno; Gil, Luiz Herman Soares; Cruz, Rafael Bastos; Silva, Alexandre de Almeida E; Tada, Mauro Shugiro; da Silva, Luiz Hildebrando Pereira\n\n2009-07-01\n\nIn RondÃ´nia State, Brazil, two new hydroelectric plants, Santo AntÃ´nio and Jirau, are scheduled for construction on the Madeira River, upriver from the State capital, Porto Velho. The current study analyzes malaria prevalence before the construction and provides information on the possible impacts of malaria burden related to the influx of thousands of persons attracted by direct and indirect employment opportunities. According to the findings, malaria is present throughout the region, with varying prevalence rates. The existence of potential asymptomatic malaria carriers among the local population may be epidemiologically relevant and should be considered in the malaria control programs organized by public authorities and companies responsible for building the power plants, aimed at early diagnosis and treatment, vector control, water supply, and infrastructure in the urban areas.\n\nWater environments: anthropogenic pressures and ecosystem changes in the Atlantic drainage basins of Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarques, Marcia; da Costa, Monica F; Mayorga, Maria Irles de O; Pinheiro, PatrÃ­cia R\n\n2004-02-01\n\nDensely occupied drainage basins and coastal zones in developing countries that are facing economic growth are likely to suffer from moderate to severe environmental impacts regarding different issues. The catchment basins draining towards the Atlantic coast from northeastern to southern Brazil include a wide range of climatic zones and diverse ecosystems. Within its borders lies the Atlantic rain forest, significant extensions of semiarid thorn forests (caatinga), vast tree and scrub woodlands (cerrado) and most of the 6670 km of the Brazilian coast and its marine ecosystems. In recent decades, human activities have increasingly advanced over these natural resources. Littoralization has imposed a burden on coastal habitats and communities. Most of the native vegetation of the cerrado and caatinga was removed and only 7% of the original Atlantic rainforest still exists. Estuaries, bays and coastal lagoons have been irreversibly damaged. Land uses, damming and water diversion have become the major driving forces for habitat loss and aquatic ecosystem modification. Regardless of the contrast between the drought-affected northeastern Brazil and the much more prosperous and industrialized southeastern/southern Brazil, the impacts on habitat and communities were found equally severe in both cases. Attempts to halt environmental degradation have not been effective. Instead of focusing on natural resources separately, it is suggested that more integrated environmental policies that focus on aquatic ecosystems integrity are introduced.\n\nCretaceous-Paleogene ostracods from the ParaÃ­ba Basin, northeastern Brazil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Lima Barros, CecÃ­lia; Piovesan, Enelise Katia; Oliveira Agostinho, Sonia Maria\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis work presents a detailed taxonomic study on the marine ostracods from the ParaÃ­ba Basin, northeastern Brazil, in wells from the wells ItamaracÃ¡-1IT-03-PE and Poty-1PO-01-PE, which record the Maastrichtian-Danian boundary. Besides the taxonomic data, this paper contributes to the paleoenvironmental knowledge of Cretaceous-Paleogene ostracods from the ParaÃ­ba Basin. The analysis of 98 samples of the well ItamaracÃ¡-1IT-03-PE and 59 samples of the Poty-1PO-01-PE resulted in the record of 34 ostracode species, all representative of a marine environment with normal salinity. Seven new species are proposed: Cytherella centrocompressa sp. nov.; Cytherella paraibensis sp. nov.; Neonesidea potyensis sp. nov.; Bythoceratina spinosa sp. nov.; Eucytherura ventrotuberculata sp. nov.; Langiella fauthi sp. nov. and Protobuntonia punctatum sp. nov.\n\nBioclimatic distribution and prevalence maps for Fasciola hepatica in EspÃ­rito Santo State, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Fasciolosis affects different ruminant species and leads to great economic losses for cattle farmers worldwide. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate bovine fasciolosis prevalence in the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil, using slaughter maps provided by slaughterhouses and verifying the origin of cattle. Methods A map was created based on analysis of epidemiological data. The ArcGIS/ArcINFO 10.1 software was employed in order to elaborate updated bioclimatic maps that displayed the fasciolosis prevalence within the state â per cityâ between 2009 and 2011. Results According to the bioclimatic map it was clear that 52.24% of the stateâs total area comprise regions considered favorable for the development and survival of Fasciola hepatica. According to the data provided by slaughterhouses, the parasite was more frequent in the cities of AtÃ­lio VivÃ¡cqua, Itapemirim and Anchieta with respective prevalence of 28.41, 25.50 and 24.95%. Although the northern portion of the state is also favorable for the disease maintenance (reaching rates above 90%), several cities presented prevalence of only 0.99 and 1.94% respectively. These findings indicate that climatic and environmental factors only cannot be considered preponderant to fasciolosis occurrence. Regarding the slaughterhouse located in Anchieta city, the higher prevalence was registered in the cities of JerÃ´nimo Monteiro, Alegre and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, with mean prevalence of 1.21, 1.07 and 2.09% respectively. Conclusion Although the present findings suggest a pattern for the prevalence of fasciolosis, records of the cities for the occurrence of the disease usually do not reflect the true origin of animals.

To classify the psychological, physical and sexual violence, the World Health Organization instrument on violence against women was used and a questionnaire to investigate the sociodemographic, behavioral characteristics, and the womenâs family and life history was developed. The statistical analyzes used were Poisson regression, Fisherâs exact test and Chi-square. RESULTS The prevalence we observed were psychological 25.3% (95%CI 22.6â28.2); physical 9.9% (95%CI 8.1â11.9) and sexual 5.7% (95%CI 4.3â7.3). Psychological violence remained associated with education, marital status, maternal history of intimate partner violence, sexual violence in childhood and drug use, while physical assault was related to age, education, marital status and maternal history of intimate partner violence. Sexual violence occurred the most among women with low income, and victims of sexual violence in childhood. CONCLUSIONS Psychological, physical and sexual violence showed highly frequency among women assisted by primary care services. Sociodemographic and behavioral factors, personal experiences, and maternal violence influence the phenomenon.

However, details of the kinematics of deformation and related stress changes within these zones have received relatively little attention. In this study we conduct the first-ever systematic, multi-basin fault-slip measurement campaign within the late Cenozoic Rio Grande rift of northern New Mexico to address the mechanisms and causes of extensional strain transfer associated with a broad accommodation zone. Numerous (562) kinematic measurements were collected at fault exposures within and adjacent to the NE-trending Santo Domingo Basin accommodation zone, or relay, which structurally links the N-trending, right-stepping en echelon Albuquerque and EspaÃ±ola rift basins. The following observations are made based on these fault measurements and paleostresses computed from them. (1) Compared to the typical northerly striking normal to normal-oblique faults in the rift basins to the north and south, normal-oblique faults are broadly distributed within two merging, NE-trending zones on the northwest and southeast sides of the Santo Domingo Basin. (2) Faults in these zones have greater dispersion of rake values and fault strikes, greater dextral strike-slip components over a wide northerly strike range, and small to moderate clockwise deflections of their tips. (3) Relative-age relations among fault surfaces and slickenlines used to compute reduced stress tensors suggest that far-field, ~E-Wâtrending Ï3 stress trajectories were perturbed 45Â° to 90Â° clockwise into NW to N trends within the Santo Domingo zones. (4) Fault-stratigraphic age relations constrain the stress perturbations to the later stages of rifting, possibly as late as 2.7â1.1 Ma. Our fault observations and previous paleomagnetic evidence of postâ2.7 Ma counterclockwise vertical-axis rotations are consistent with increased\n\nTectonic setting of the TaubatÃ© Basin (Southeastern Brazil): Insights from regional seismic profiles and outcrop data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCognÃ©, Nathan; Cobbold, Peter R.; Riccomini, Claudio; Gallagher, Kerry\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIn southeastern Brazil, a series of onshore Tertiary basins provides good evidence for post-rift tectonic activity. So as better to constrain their tectonic setting, we have revisited outcrops in the TaubatÃ© and Resende basins and have reinterpreted 11 seismic profiles of the TaubatÃ© Basin. Where Eocene to Oligocene strata crop out, syn-sedimentary faults are common and their senses of slip are mainly normal. In contrast, for two outcrops in particular, where syn-sedimentary faults have put Precambrian crystalline basement against Eocene strata, senses of slip are strongly left-lateral, as well as normal. Thus we distinguish between thin-skinned and thick-skinned faulting. Furthermore, at four outcrops, Precambrian basement has overthrust Tertiary or Quaternary strata. On the seismic profiles, basal strata onlap basement highs. Structures and stratigraphic relationships are not typical of a rift basin. Although normal faults are common, they tend to be steeply dipping, their stratigraphic offsets are small (tens of metres) and the faults do not bound large stratigraphic wedges or tilted blocks. At the edges of the basin, Eocene or Oligocene strata dip basinward, have been subject to exhumation, and in places form gentle anticlines, so that we infer post-Oligocene inversion. We conclude that, after an earlier phase of deformation, probably during the Late Cretaceous, the TaubatÃ© Basin formed under left-lateral transtension during the Palaeogene, but was subject to right-lateral transpression during the Neogene. Thus the principal directions of stress varie"
