        "text": "Isabella and Ferdinand\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs\n\nSecond cousins marrying one another was not at all unusual in the fifteenth century. So, in the city of Valladolid, on October 19, 1469, a pair of teenagers were married, joining the Spanish Kingdoms of Castille and Aragon into a partnership, based solely on the union of the newlyweds. Isabella of Castille was eighteen years old; her husband, Ferdinand of Aragon, was a year younger. The two met one another for the first time a mere four days before their wedding. Together, the struggles of these formidable individuals shaped the Iberian peninsula, for centuries to come; their reigns culminated in that eventful year of 1492, when they conquered the last Moorish Sultanate of Grenada, outfitted a Genoese sailor and navigator (named Cristobal Colon) with three ships for a journey into unknown western waters, and expelled tens of thousands of Spanish Jews from the peninsula, in a grim attempt at national unity through religious uniformity.\n\nBefore they came to dominate the peninsula, however, and take the first strides towards an empire, the couple first had to put their own houses in order. Their marriage was not zealously sought after by many within Spain, nor by the Kings of France or Portugal, for whom a union of the crowns would pose an obvious threat. For centuries, Spain had remained a disunited collection of kingdoms, both Christian and Muslim. Countless wars and internal rebellions had reduced the old Moorish hegemony down to a stick-thin little state of Grenada, by the late fifteenth century. In the north, meanwhile, the Christian kingdoms of old had solidified into the principal states of Castille and Aragon. Differentiating along political and mercantile lines, Castille controlled most of the geographical territory of Spain by the time of Isabella, but had fallen on hard times through civil war and the financial mismanagement of her brother, King Enrique IV. Aragon, by contrast, was a commercial power past its prime, one whose dominion stretched across the western Mediterranean. These holdings aside, Isabella and Ferdinand had to contend with opponents at home, before they could think of anything else.\n\nIsabella inherited the crown of Castille from her brother in 1474, and immediately had to fight for it. Several nobles withdrew support, in favor of the claim of Enrique’s daughter, Joanna, who was backed by Portugal. The subsequent war was a narrow victory for Isabella and Ferdinand. The Portuguese recognized Isabella’s right to rule Castile, but won an enormous victory by blocking Spanish interference in the growing Portuguese trade on the shores of western Africa. This conundrum helped spur their outfitting of Columbus, over ten years later, in a bid to outflank the Portuguese by a route west across the Atlantic. This voyage unwittingly led to the Caribbean, and the rest is history.\n\nConsolidating her power over Castille in the wake of the Portuguese war, Isabella valiantly brought to heel wayward cities - through charm, personality, and a brilliant strategic mind. Overcoming the natural obstacles of a ruling queen, in an age when the “general European consensus on the question of female rule was to avoid it whenever possible,” she personally took charge of peace negotiations with Portugal, while steadying Castile’s finances (which had teetered during the reign of her brother). Ferdinand, on the other hand, was busy in his own kingdom, doing battle with the French. His power in Castile was limited, as he was Isabella’s consort; in Aragon, however, he exercised his authority as its King, after the death of his father. In this realm, where Catalan and Aragonese was the lingua franca, a semi-constitutional framework of government existed. Ferdinand was King - true - but he was obliged to summon the regional Parliaments, or ‘Corts’, to vote in new laws and seek redress for grievances. In Aragon, Isabella’s power was curbed, but Ferdinand did not reign in the absolutist sense that his wife did in Castile. Married though they were, their kingdoms remained separate political entities until the early eighteenth century, although they were joined in common cause. This cause turned them towards the reduction of the last Muslim kingdom in Spain: Grenada.\n\nEnding the Reconquista\n\nSeven hundred years before Isabella and Ferdinand, an army of Muslim Berbers and Arabs invaded the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispana, and conquered it. The emirates that emerged from this conquest once held most of the peninsula in their grasp, but the stubborn Christian kingdoms, that surfaced in its wake, clung to their northern footholds. In the following centuries, the Emirate of Cordoba fractured into petty warring kingdoms, replaced by successive dynasties that proved unable to halt the methodical reconquest of the nascent Christian realms. The Emirate of Granada was all that remained, and Isabella and Ferdinand were determined to reduce it, and unite Spain under Catholic rule.\n\nFor ten years, the monarchs waged a methodical crusade, reducing Granadian fortresses, one by one, until they were posed to strike at Granada itself. Unable to hold out any longer, Sultan Muhammed XII surrendered his city in January, 1492. The seven hundred-year-old Reconquista was over, at last. But in the wake of their victory, Isabella and Ferdinand committed brutal acts, in their pursuit of a Catholically united Spain. In the same year, the monarchs issued the Alhambra Decree ordering, “the said Jews and Jewesses of our kingdoms to depart and never to return or come back to them or to any of them.” The purpose of the expulsion was to prevent the possibility of previously baptized Jews retrograding back into the old religion through pressure; it aligned with the earnest desires of the King and Queen to reduce Spain’s religious diversity, in the hope that a Catholic nation would breed unity and stability. Many among Spain’s Jewish elites underwent baptism in the months leading up to the deadline for removal; but upwards of forty thousand Jews, dramatically below the exaggerated numbers previously put forth, were expelled from the lands of their forefathers in one of the darkest moments in Spanish history.\n\nThe infamous inquisition was likewise formed under their auspices, subject to crown authority, rather than the Pope’s. Columbus’s voyages bore unexpected fruit, opening the floodgates to a hemisphere rich in diverse and sophisticated civilizations. The conquests that followed established Spain as a global empire and are, perhaps, the most enduring legacy of Isabella and Ferdinand - for they laid the foundations for all that came after.\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand\n\nTwo Kingdoms\n\nAn eighteen-year-old woman and a seventeen-year-old man come together in matrimony, on an October day, in 1469. They are second cousins, the heirs of Spain’s two most powerful Christian kingdoms, and are surrounded by enemies. The marriage is fraught with danger, and the newlyweds had only met four days before they “tied the knot.” So began the married life of Isabella of Castile, and Ferdinand of Aragon, from whose union would spring the onset of Spain’s global empire. But first, they needed to put their own houses in order.\n\nIsabella was a woman, and the next in line to rule Castile - the largest kingdom in the peninsula. Her claim descended from her brother, Enrique IV, whose death led to her attainment of the throne. Others saw her as a usurper. Portugal and France threw their support behind Enrique’s daughter, Joanna, and so, war followed. The conflict resulted in a victory for the young couple; Isabella was recognized as Queen of Castile. In the resulting treaty, though, she was forced to give up any thoughts of ingratiating Spain in the growing trade of the Portuguese, along the western coasts of Africa. This concession spurred Isabella and Ferdinand to outfit an expedition led by the Genoese navigator, Cristobal Colon (a decade later), in an attempt to outflank the Portuguese, by sailing westward across the Atlantic, to find the fabled spice islands of the Indian Ocean. Colon unwittingly landed in the Caribbean, and the rest is history.\n\nIn the meantime, Isabella went about consolidating her rule in Castile. Under her brother, law and order had disintegrated; cities rebelled and had yet to return to crown control. Overcoming the obstacles of her gender, in an age when the “general European consensus on the question of female rule was to avoid it whenever possible,” the Queen swiftly reigned in these wayward cities, while simultaneously setting Castile’s finances in order, and gave birth to five children over the years.\n\nFerdinand, meanwhile, inherited the crown of Aragon, after his father’s death, in 1479. Unlike Castile, which centered on an absolutist monarchy, where power lay largely in the hands of the monarch, Aragon had a more constitutional bent. The King was obliged to annually call upon his kingdoms’ regional parliament, or ‘corts,’ in order to enact major legislation, through a unanimous vote of the corts’s four estates. In Castile, Ferdinand was limited in power, as the consort of Isabella, while in Aragon, Isabella did not exercise power, as she was Ferdinand’s consort. Though married, the monarchs did not unite their kingdoms into a single realm. Indeed, Aragon (where Catalan and Aragonese were the principal languages - and still are), remained independent in its judicial and legislative processes from Castile, until the beginning of the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, the partnership between Isabella and Ferdinand ensured that these kingdoms thereafter shared a monarch.\n\nReconquista and Expulsion\n\nHaving inherited their thrones and consolidated power, Isabella and Ferdinand began the process of unifying Spain. They believed that unity worked best if everyone was of the same religious denomination. Spain had been home to Muslim communities for centuries - ever since Berber and Arab armies invaded the peninsula in the eighth century. Alongside them, Spanish Jews had lived, prospered, and suffered, under their various rulers. Both would be eliminated, as independent groups, by Isabella and Ferdinand.\n\nSeven hundred years after the earliest Muslim invasions, all that remained of their once-mighty kingdoms was the small Sultanate of Grenada, at the very bottom of the peninsula. In the 1480s, the monarchs began a series of military campaigns, aiming at reducing Grenada for good. In 1492, the city fell, and the Sultan surrendered; after seven hundred years, Spain was united, at last, under the Catholic King and Queen. They did not waste time in further consolidating their control. Three months after taking Grenada, they issued the Alhambra decree ordering, “the said Jews and Jewesses of our kingdoms to depart and never to return or come back to them or to any of them.” While many Jews underwent baptism in the months before the deadline (upwards of forty thousand), others left the lands of their forefathers for new homelands across the Mediterranean. It was a dark decision, but Isabella and Ferdinand believed that new converts could only strengthen the unity of their realms. Later rebellions, particularly those of Muslim converts, proved otherwise.\n\nAnother sinister development came in the years before Grenada’s fall. Ferdinand and Isabella sought to prevent converts from withdrawing back into the religions they had converted from. So, they established the Spanish Inquisition, whose duty was to root out heresy. Bringing the Inquisition firmly under crown control, rather than that of the Pope, the Spanish Inquisition had a great deal more leeway to fulfill its duties, than if they had fallen under the jurisdiction of Rome.\n\n1492, then, was an eventful year for Isabella and Ferdinand. Of immense historical importance, was the expedition and return of Colon to Spain, with tales of the Caribbean. The floodgates soon opened and the foundations for Spain's global empire were laid. None of it would have come about had it not been for the durability of Isabella and Ferdinand’s relationship. Ruling separate kingdoms, conquering a peninsula, dispatching expeditions across oceans, and all while raising children, is enough to have strained any relationship; yet, their marriage endured, and from it, sprang a Spain altogether eager for expansion and glory.\n\nIsabella and Ferdinand\n\nA Union\n\nTwo teenagers, who happen to be second cousins, come together in marriage, in October, 1469. Both are heirs to Spain’s most powerful Christian kingdoms; their union is something to be prevented in the eyes of many. Threats abound as the couple “tied the knot.” They had known each other for a mere four days before the wedding. Isabella of Castile was eighteen, Ferdinand of Aragon was seventeen. They were about to embark on a married life fraught with war and strife, one in which they would both have to assert their control over their own kingdoms, and bring them in line, to unite Spain under a Catholic monarchy.\n\nThe first step was to gain the throne. Isabella’s brother ruled in Castile and, when he died, she would take his place. When he did die, however, Portugal and France moved to support Isabella’s niece, Joanna’s, bid to rule Castille. War erupted; Ferdinand led his wife’s armies against those of Portugal in bloody battles, from which Isabella emerged the Queen of Castile. In the peace treaty, though, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to keep Spanish ships from participating in Portugal’s growing trade along the west coast of Africa. This concession led them to outfit Columbus’s expedition over ten years later, in an effort to gain access to the spice trade, by sailing directly west. Instead of reaching the Indian Ocean, Columbus landed in the Caribbean, and the rest is history.\n\nIn the meantime, Isabella consolidated her power in Castile, bringing wayward cities under her control, all while revamping her kingdom’s flagging finances. Ferdinand inherited his crown in 1479, when his father died, but unlike Castile, where a monarch ruled at the top, Aragon’s was more constitutional. Here, Ferdinand was obliged to summon the corts, an annual parliament of four estates, whose job was to vote in new laws and seek redress over past grievances. Aragon’s people speak Catalan and Aragonese, and they ruled an empire that included Sicily, southern Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica. Ferdinand may have been married to Isabella, but he had no real power in Castile, just like she had no real power in Aragon. The two kingdoms shared a monarch, but remained politically independent until the eighteenth century.\n\nFirmly in control of their realms, Isabella and Ferdinand now turned their attention to uniting the whole of Spain. This meant eliminating the last Moorish kingdom of Grenada. Seven hundred years before, a Muslim army of Berbers and Arabs invaded Visigothic Spain and conquered it, establishing a powerful realm, which just failed to bring the whole peninsula under their control. The Christian kingdoms that emerged in the wake of this conquest, slowly and methodically, pushed the Muslims back over the following centuries, fighting one another as often as they fought the Muslims. But now, Grenada was all that stood between Isabella and Ferdinand, and their dream of a Catholic Spain. For ten years, they reduced the Grenadians until their armies were poised to strike at the city itself. Before that could happen, Sultan Muhammed XII surrendered his kingdom. Spain was united at last - but not along religious lines.\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs believed that the stability of their new kingdoms relied upon religious unity. Spain had been home to Muslims and Jews, for centuries. But now, they were to be expelled. In 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered, “the said Jews and Jewesses of our kingdoms to depart and never to return or come back to them or to any of them.” Many Jews among the political and social elite underwent baptism in the months leading up to the expulsion deadline, but upwards of forty thousand were expelled from the land of their forefathers, in one of Spain’s darkest hours. The defeated Muslims, on the other hand, could likewise leave the country, or stay, and convert to Christianity. Harsh though these measures were, in the minds of Isabella and Ferdinand, they would bring about peace among the Spanish people, as co-religionists would live in greater harmony than people of different religions.\n\nAt the same time, Columbus returned with tales of new lands to the west, brimming with opportunity and wealth. Spain was now looking outward. The global empire that arose in the next hundred years was the greatest of its day. Though they did not live to see Spain’s flag flying from Manila to Madrid, Isabella and Ferdinand laid the foundations for Spain’s golden age of empire. They endured much, and their marriage is an example of a partnership built to last."
