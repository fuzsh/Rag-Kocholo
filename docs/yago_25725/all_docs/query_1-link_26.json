        "text": "\"I believe that its male line is completely extinct; and I always thought that, since its origin, this family had the crime of its forefather hanging over it.\"\n\nBraamcamp Freire, Brazões da Sala de Sintra, 1903, vol. 1, p.98\n\n\"No other family had a more brilliant beginning than the Eça's; and although it should have kept the brightness and greatness of its origin in order to be respected, it unfortunately fell into total decadence; thus it is almost extinct.\"\n\nDom António Caetano de Sousa, História Genealogica da Casa Real Portuguesa, 1745, vol. 1, p. 644.\n\nTo Dom Nuno de Eça, in New Zealand,\n\nand to João de Eça Teixeira, in Lisbon,\n\ncousins in the darkness of time, and over\n\nthe seas [...],\n\nI dedicate this first disclosure\n\nof my Famílias Macaenses,\n\nwhich is also in debt to them.\n\nThe two above mentioned great masters of Portuguese genealogy were wrong. One, because he thought the EÇAs male line completely extinct; the other, because he wrote that it fell into total decadence.\n\nIn fact, there is in Macao a male line of the EÇAs - which remained unknown to Portuguese genealogists and goes against Braamcamp's assertion; on the other hand, the fact that this family includes successive captains of the Orient and martyrs of their mother land does not agree with Caetano de Sousa's claim.\n\nThe origin of the family name EÇA is known; it comes from a Spanish word meaning the name of a village in Galicia, which was given, in strange circumstances, to Dom Fernando - the eldest son of the Infante Dom João, and consequently the grandson of [King] Dom Pedro I [of Portugal] and the beautiful Inês de Castro - by his cousin, the Duke of Arjona.\n\nAll the chronicles relate, in comprehensive detail, the tragic story of the Infante Dom João, the one who could have become King, if the argument of legitimacy had prevailed in the 1383 crisis. Son of Dom Pedro and Dona Inês de Castro, he was married to Dona Maria Teles de Menezes, sister of Dona Leonor Teles, Queen of Portugal through her marriage to King Dom Fernando.\n\nFrom this Royal matrimony, only Dona Beatriz was born, and Dona Leonor was always aware that the presumptive heir to the Crown would be the Infante Dom João, half-brother of the King. She could not stand the idea of seeing her own sister become Queen, so she decided to get rid of her by convincing the Infante Dom João that he would be able to marry Dona Beatriz, thus incontestably becoming the King. In order to do that, he would need to get rid of his wife, whom her own sister was accusing of being adulterous...!\n\nBraamcamp Freire gives us an almost romanticized account of the sequence of events; he even imagines the short dialogue between the Infante Dom Joao and his wife, when he suddenly broke into her quarters and attacked her twice with the dagger of the Count of Barcelos, with enormous brutality, first in the chest and then in the groin, accusing her with loud screams of the horrible crime of which he considered her guilty.\n\nHis expiation started immediately as the Queen, in a most hypocrital manner, and contrary to what she had promised him, expressed the horror that the martyrdom of her sister had caused her. He was furthermore pursued by the Count of Neiva, brother of the victim, who forced him to run away, without any Royal protection, to the remotest parts of the Province of Beira, from where, after a great deal of hardships and privations, he crossed the border to Castile.\n\nKing Don Juan I of Castile, taking profit from anything which might increase the confusion in the Portuguese Court, readily offered him protection. He donated Dom João the domain of Alba de Tormes and Valencia de Campos, which, since then, was known under the name Valencia de Don Juan. But, in 1383, when the news of the death of King Dom Fernando arrived at Castile, the Infante Dom João lost his supreme protection, as the King of Castile gave orders to imprison him, being afraid that he might pretend to the throne that he himself pretended to.\n\nHe was imprisoned for some years, and it is now commonly claimed that the Mestre de Aviz -an illegitimate son of Dom Pedro and his mistress Teresa Lourenço - assumed the title of 'Defensor do Reyno' ('Defender of the Kingdom') on behalf of his half-brother, imprisoned in Castile. The Mestre de Aviz, according to Dom António Caetano de Sousa, \"as soon as he was elected 'Defensor do Reyno' tried to make it clear to the Infante Dom Joao, his half-brother, that he was adopting this title on his behalf; in order to liberate the Country and in the expectation that one day Dom Joao would escape and become the real ruler. To prove that he had his brother in mind, he gave orders to have his flags painted with a portrait of his brother in chains, like he was, by that time, in Castile.\"1\n\nPortuguese historians did not pay much attention to the existence of this son of Dom Pedro, concerned as they were with focusing their research into the exceptional personality of the Mestre de Aviz, founder of one Dynasty and father of an illustrious generation. In 1947, the historian Salvador Dias Arnaut, then conducting research at the University of Coimbra - later to became a professor there and probably the greatest Portuguese specialist on the History of the 1383 Crisis- was to publish a thesis on the battle held in Trancoso, in which he defended with \"a different intensity of formulation\" that in the crisis caused by the death of Dom Fernando, \"the people, eager for independence, acclaimed as their King, if only in thought, Dom João, the son of Dom Pedro and Dona Inês de Castro, who was in Castile\"2 and to whom,\" through the lineage, the throne was undoubtely due\".3\n\nIn that dark hour for the Country, all hope was vested in the Infante Dom João. 4 However, the subsequent events - the overwhelming intervention of Doutor João das Regras at the Cortes (General Assembly of the National Representatives) of Coimbra - changed forever the destiny of Portugal. From 'Defensor do Reino', the Mestre de Aviz became King of Portugal; acclaimed by the Cortes with the title of Dom João I. His brother remained in Spain, having remarried, to Dona Constança, who was also a half-sister of the King of Castile. He died, in 1397, probably before he was even fifty years old.\n\nBy Dona Maria Teles, his first wife, he had one son, Fernando, who when still a child heard the appalling screams of his mother being murdered by his father. By Dona Constança, his second wife, he had two daughters, Dona Beatriz and Dona Maria. He also had two illegitimate sons, Dom Pedro da Guerra and Dom Afonso, both later married to women related to the most significant - although on the opposite side - intervening parties in the dynastic crisis: Dom Pedro da Guerra married a daughter of João Fernandes de Andeiro \"from love, much against the will of the Infante\",5 and Dom Afonso married the daughter of... João das Regras!\n\nAnd what happened to the son of Dona Maria Teles, the child who so early lost both his parents, one a fugitive murderer, the other brutally murdered?\n\nDom Fernando6 went to Castile, where he became close to his cousin, the Duke of Arjona, who donated to him, as we have already mentioned, the village of Eça. The Royal blood made him illustrious, but did not give him a family name - Kings have no family names! - and shortly afterwards he took for himself the name of his village: Dom Fernando de Eça!\n\nHe died abroad, but the Abbess of Lorvão, Dona Catarina, his daughter, brought his remains to Portugal, and he is buried in the main chapel of the church of the Convento do Espírito Santo (Convent of the Holy Ghost), in Gouveia, under the following epitaph:\n\n\"Here lies Dom Fernando de Eça, son of the Infante Dom João and grandson of His Majesty the King Dom Pedro of Portugal and of the Infanta Dona Inês de Castro, his wife [...]\".7\n\nAlthough the blood of the First Dynasty, which ran in his veins, did not give him access to the throne, he made use of the heraldic symbol which came from the first Kings of Portugal. His heraldic arms are indeed closely derived from the old arms of Portugal: a cross formed by five small blue escutcheons in a silver ground, the flanking ones lying horizontally and pointing to the centre, and carrying, each one, nine bezants in groups of three; a purple lion's ear, with its knots, crossed over the escutcheons, except for the one in the centre. As a crest, a blue or red eagle is displayed, decorated with gold and carrying on its chest five silver bezants forming across. No other family in Portugal uses arms that identify so closely with the dawn of the Nation...\n\nDom Fernando de Eça was truly the founder of the Eças, not only because he was the first to bear this name, but also because he had - it is claimed - forty-two children, being reported to have been married to several women at the same time.\n\nIn the following genealogical table, which forms the introduction to the EÇAs chapter of my work Famílias Macaenses (Macanese Families), now being concluded, I record four of these children: two of them with descendants in Macao; and two others with descendants in the island of Terceira, in the Azores - one of them being one of my ancestors.\n\nA descendant of Dom Garcia de Eça is Dona Maria Luísa de Mendonça e Eça ◇ Dom António Félix Machado, the prestigious Marquis of Montebelo, a famous painter in the Court of Madrid and ancestor, also in the male line, of the Machados de Mendonça, from Macao. Also his descendant, by another line, is Dona Filipa da Guerra ◇ Francisco de Almeida de Ornelas, from the island of Terceira.\n\nThere is a grandson of Dom Pedro de Eça, Dom Fernando de Eça ◇ Dona Leonor de Gusmão, also from the island of Terceira.\n\nDona Antónia de Eça ◇ Paulo Ferreira de Gusmão, from Terceira, is a granddaughter of Dom Duarte de Eça.\n\nFrom Dom Fernando de Eça, †1501, in the siege of Mombaça, descend, without interruption of the male line, the Eças from Macao, contrary to the assertion of Braamcamp that the male line was extinct.\n\nThe following text is the full transcription8 of the chapter on this subject of my work Famílias Macaenses, a research pursued under the sponsorship of the Fundação Oriente (Orient Foundation).

According to Costa Brochado, he was \"one of the most notable men of my generation [...]. Teixeira brightened, with the sharpness of his spirit, what it seems to me is the last bookshop of Lisbon [Sá da Costa]. José Francisco Teixeira, founder and president of the Tertúlia [literary assembly] was a very rare man, with an encyclopoedical knowledge. He knew about everything, and nothing failed to interest him. His companions at the Tertúlia sought his help as they would do with a dictionary [...] He had a paradigmatic memory. One day, during one of our constant dialogues, I can not recall for what reason, I recited these well known verses: \"Mon verre est très petit mais je bois dans mon verre\". He immediately said, vehemently, as if he had been wounded: \"These are wrong! They are verses of Musset, but they go like this: Mon verre n 'est pas grand, mais je bois dans mon verre.\" He corrected, equally quickly, dates and names, from the month before to the fifteenth century! The history of philosophy had no secrets for him. In that matter, he was particulary good [...]. Politically, he was a liberal and, as far as I could understand, nothing more. Philosophically, he was a cepticist and he considered himself, religiously, an atheist; but I convinced him that he was, like Bertrand Russell, an agnostic [...]. Obviously, a man like this would never be able to attain, in our times, the heights that his moral and intellectual value justified and deserved.\"24\n\nTown mansion, in the Praia Grande, belonging to the Eça family.\n\nPresently housing the Colégio Mateus Ricci (Matteo Ricci College).\n\nChildren [of: {2.1.1.1.1.2.}]:\n\n1(VII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.} Dona Maria José de Eça Teixeira\n\n{sister of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.2.}\n\n° {Shanghai (Christ the King) 2 June 1940}.\n\n◇1: Augusto Ferreira Pereira.\n\n◇2: Daniel Silva Carvalho Silvano (employee of Air France and of Balkan Airways, in Lisbon).\n\nDaughter [of {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.}]  first marriage:\n\n1(VIII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.} Dona Cristina de Eça Teixeira Pereira\n\n° {Lisbon, 4 July 1959}.\n\n† {South Africa 18 June 1982} victim of a car accident.\n\n◇Ken Beecroft (from Johannesburg, South Africa).\n\nDaughter [of: {13.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.}]:\n\n1(IX) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.} Kelly Pereira Beecroft\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nChildren [of: {13.1.1.1.1.2.1.}]  second marriage:\n\n2(VIII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.} Dona Patrícia Teixeira Silvano\n\n° {Lisbon (São Sebastião) 9 March 1965).\n\nFlight attendant at TAP Air Portugal.\n\n◇{1 Aug. 1992} José Manuel Aires (pilot of TAP Air Portugal).\n\nDaughter [of: {13.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.}]:\n\n1(IX) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.} Dona Mafalda Silvano Aires\n\n° {Lisbon, 25 Jan. 1993}.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nChildren [of: {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.}]:\n\n3(VIII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.} Dona Mónica Teixeira Silvano\n\n{sister of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1+2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.}\n\n° {Lisbon (São Sebastião) 3 Oct. 1969}.\n\nTravel agent.\n\n◇ {Parede, 4 Dec. 1987} José de Melo.\n\nChildren [of: {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.}]:\n\n1(IX) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.} Diogo Silvano de Melo\n\n{brother of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.2.}\n\n° {Cascais, 5 May 1989}.\n\n2(IX) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.2.} Dona Cláudia Silvano de Melo\n\n{sister of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.}\n\n° {Lisbon. 8 April 1994}.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nChildren [of: {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.}]:\n\n4(VIII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.1.4.} Ricardo Teixeira Silvano\n\n{brother of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.+ 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.+2.1.1.1.1.2.1.3.}\n\n° {Lisbon (São João de Deus) 18 June 1972}.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nChildren [of: {2.1.1.1.1.2.}]:\n\nl(VII) {2.1.1.1.1.2.2.} João Álvaro de Eça Teixeira {brother of: 2.1.1.1.1.2.1.}\n\n° {Shanghai (Christ the King) 9 Feb. 1942}.\n\nEmployee of South African Airways, in Lisbon.\n\n◇{Lisbon (5th C.
