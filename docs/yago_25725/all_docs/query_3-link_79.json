        "text": "Ferdinand I (Portuguese: Fernando; 31 October 1345 – 22 October 1383), sometimes called the Handsome (o Formoso) or occasionally the Inconstant (o Inconstante), was the King of Portugal from 1367 until his death in 1383. He was also briefly made King of Galicia, in 1369 (a claim which he would maintain until 1373). Facing a lack of legitimate male heirs, his death led to the 1383–85 crisis, also known as the Portuguese interregnum.\n\nKing of Portugal\n\nReign: 18 January 1367 - 22 October 1383\n\nPredecessor: Peter I\n\nSuccessor: Beatrice (disputed) or John I\n\nKing of Galicia\n\nReign: 1369 - 1374\n\nPredecessor: Peter of Castile\n\nSuccessor: Henry II of Castile\n\nBorn: 31 October 1345\n\nCoimbra, Kingdom of Portugal\n\nDied: 22 October 1383 (aged 37)\n\nLisbon, Kingdom of Portugal\n\nBurial: Carmo Convent, Lisbon,\n\nKingdom of Portugal\n\nSpouse: Leonor Teles (m. 1372)\n\nIssue: Beatrice, Queen of Portugal and Castile.\n\nIsabel, Countess of Gijón and Noreña (ill.).\n\nHouse: Burgundy\n\nFather: Peter I of Portugal\n\nMother: Constanza Manuel\n\n__________________________________\n\nLeonor Teles (or Teles de Meneses; c. 1350 – c. 1405) was queen consort of Portugal by marriage to King Ferdinand I, and regent of Portugal. She was one of the protagonists, along with her brothers and her daughter Beatrice, of the events that led to the succession crisis of 1383–1385, which culminated in the defeat of her son-in-law King John I of Castile and his armies in the Battle of Aljubarrota. Called \"the Treacherous\" (a Aleivosa in Portuguese) by her subjects, who execrated her on account of her adultery and treason to her native country, she was dubbed by historian Alexandre Herculano as \"the Portuguese Lucrezia Borgia\".\n\nQueen Consort of Portugal\n\nTenure: 5 May 1372 - 22 October 1383\n\nRegent of Portugal\n\nRegency: 22 October 1383 - January 1384"
