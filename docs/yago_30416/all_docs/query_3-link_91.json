        "text": "From 1531, the Princess Mary was often sick with irregular menstruation and depression, although it is not clear whether this was caused by stress, puberty or a more deep-seated disease.\n\nShe was not permitted to see her mother, whom King Henry VIII had sent to live away from court. In early 1533, King Henry VIII married Anne Boleyn, and in May Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, formally declared the marriage with Catherine void and the marriage to Anne valid.\n\nKing Henry VIII repudiated Pope Clement VII’s authority, declaring himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. Queen Catherine was demoted to Dowager Princess of Wales (a title she would have held as Prince Arthur’s widow), and Mary was deemed illegitimate. Mary was styled “The Lady Mary” rather than Princess, and her place in the line of succession was transferred to Henry and Anne’s newborn daughter, Princess Elizabeth.\n\nMary would later be restored via the Third Succession Act of 1543. Her younger half-brother, Edward, succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine as King Edward VI of England and Ireland. When King Edward VI became terminally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary and Elizabeth from the line of succession because he supposed, correctly, that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had taken place during his reign.\n\nPrior King Edward VI’s death, he named the John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland’s daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII’s younger sister Mary, as his successor. This move contradicting the Act of Succession 1544, which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, and was still the Law of the land and had not been repealed.\n\nLady Jane’s mother was Frances Brandon, a granddaughter of King Henry VII and Princess Mary’s cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward’s death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother, but was warned that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Jane’s accession to the throne.\n\nAfter Edward’s death, Jane was proclaimed Qeen of England on July 10, 1553, and awaited coronation in the Tower of London. Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and support for Mary grew quickly, and most of Jane’s supporters abandoned her.\n\nThe Privy Council of England suddenly changed sides, and proclaimed Mary as Queen on July 19, 1553, deposing Jane. Her primary supporter, her father-in-law, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason, and executed less than a month later. Jane was held prisoner in the Tower, and was convicted of high treason in November 1553, which carried a sentence of death.\n\nOne of Mary’s first actions as Queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Stephen Gardiner from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay.\n\nMary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley’s scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Mary initially spared her life; however, Jane soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, became involved with Wyatt’s rebellion.\n\nWyatt’s Rebellion broke out when Mary insisted on marrying Infante Felipe of Spain and therefore guaranteeing a Catholic would continue to sit upon the English throne. Thomas Wyatt the Younger led a force from Kent to depose Queen Mary in favour of Princess Elizabeth, her Protestant half-sister, as part of a wider conspiracy which also involved the Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Lady Jane’s father.\n\nMary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the kingdom’s advantage, she would refrain from pursuing it. More on the marriage of Queen Mary and Infante Felipe in tomorrow’s post).\n\nOn reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, and the Duke of Suffolk were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned and then exiled. Princess Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.\n\nLady Jane Grey was being perceived as a threat to the Crown and Mary’s marriage to Infante Felipe. It was believed that another rebellion could rise up to replace the Catholic Mary with the Protestant Lady Jane on the English throne.\n\nIt was believed necessary to remove that threat to the throne despite the fact that Lady Jane did not actively pursue the throne or encourage rebellion in her name. Therefore, Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guilford Dudley, were both executed on February 12, 1554 At the time of her death, Jane was either 16 or 17 years old.\n\nQueen Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first Queen Regnant of England.\n\nHere is a link to a previous blog I posted on why I do not consider Lady Jane a legitimate Queen of England.\n\nhttps://wp.me/p2pver-2tw\n\nMary I (February 18, 1516 – November 17, 1558), also known as Mary Tudor, was the Queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death. She is best known for her aggressive attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII and return England to Roman Catholicism. The executions that marked her pursuit of the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England and Ireland led to her denunciation as “Bloody Mary” by her Protestant opponents.\n\nAccession\n\nOn July 6, 1553, at the age of 15, King Edward VI died from a lung infection, possibly tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to his sister Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms as well as those of his father Henry VIII, and therefore he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his half-sisters: he would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both from the line of succession in his will.\n\nContradicting the Third Succession Act, which was enacted by Henry VIII and passed by the Parliament of England in July 1543; the Act restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Dudley’s daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII’s younger sister, Mary, as his successor. Lady Jane’s mother was Frances Brandon, Mary’s cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI’s death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane’s accession to the throne. Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into East Anglia, where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down Kett’s Rebellion. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley’s, lived there. On July 9, from Kenninghall, Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward’s successor.\n\nOn July 10, 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on the same day Mary’s letter to the council arrived in London. Despite Edward’s desire to exclude Mary from the throne it was never approved by Parliament which mean that the Third Succession Act was still the extant law of the land which meant Mary was still her brother’s legal heir and successor.\n\nBy July 12, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at Framlingham Castle, Suffolk, Dudley’s support collapsed, and Jane’s attempt at usurpation was halted on July 19. Although truth be told Jane and her husband were mere pawns of Dudley’s schemes. Jane and Lord Guilford Dudley were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on August 3, 1553, on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen.\n\nOne of Mary’s first actions as queen was to order the release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from imprisonment in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtney. Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley’s scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason in the immediate aftermath of the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane’s father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On October 1, 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey."
