        "text": "Bookish, bartered, and betrayed: few girls, even in the British Royal Family, were as hounded as Lady Jane Grey. Almost three hundred years after her execution, Charles Dickens, who made a specialty of exploited children, wrote that the English axe “never struck so cruel and so vile a blow.” Jane was a cousin of Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII. As Edward lay dying, he tried to secure the legacy of his father’s Reformation by making Jane, an ardent Protestant, queen. She was fifteen. The scheme failed—her reign lasted nine days, the shortest of any British monarch—and she was held in the Tower of London. The icy morning of her death, in February, 1554, Jane watched from a window as the headless corpse of her husband, Guilford Dudley, returned from Tower Hill in a cart. On the scaffold, she asked for forgiveness in accepting the crown but maintained her innocence in the plot that had resulted in her succession. She recited the Fifty-first Psalm—“Let the bones you have crushed rejoice”—and asked the executioner to kill her quickly. Her nurses shrank back, in tears. Jane, blindfolded, knelt and groped for the block, asking, “What shall I do? Where is it?”\n\nA Jane Grey cult has lingered for centuries. (Recently, under the heading “Pleading Jane’s Case,” the Telegraph of London printed a letter suggesting that her bones be moved from the Tower, where she was buried unceremoniously next to Anne Boleyn, to Westminster Abbey.) Her life was dramatized in 1694, by John Banks, as “The Innocent Usurper,” and in 1715, by Nicholas Rowe, the author of “Tamerlane”; both used her example to try to refute the claims of the Catholic pretender, James II. In 1809, Francis Hodgson, a poet and a friend of Lord Byron’s, published a book about Jane which emphasized her virtue and piety. Similar books followed in the Victorian era—in 1853, David W. Bartlett wrote so that readers might “imitate the character” of this “beautiful and illustrious woman.” Frances Hodgson Burnett, the author of “The Secret Garden,” used Jane’s story twice, in her novels “The Shuttle” (“Not a man near who dared utter a word of pity”) and “The Lost Prince.” Dylan and the Rolling Stones both referred to her in songs (“Queen Jane Approximately” and “Lady Jane”). She has been portrayed three times on the screen—most recently by Helena Bonham Carter, in Trevor Nunn’s 1986 “Lady Jane.” In 2003, a librarian in Concrete, Washington, was discovered moonlighting as a dominatrix under the name Lady Jane Grey. This summer, when I asked Sarah Martin, the lead singer of the Texas folk-rock band Lady Jane Grey, how the group chose the name, she told me, “She was a teen-age martyr. She was spiritual, and we are, too.”\n\nOther “wronged” royals have their devotees—Mary, Queen of Scots, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and, chief among them, Diana, Princess of Wales. But when people think of Diana, they see her—the shy half wave from the carriage, the glamorous evenings out—in photographs so prized that they led to her death. Jane Grey, though, is the only English monarch since Henry VII for whom no contemporary image is known to exist. (A portrait is mentioned in a 1590 inventory, but it has never been conclusively identified.) The blank where her face should be has made it that much easier for succeeding generations to imprint their political and personal fantasies on her. However, in the past two years two purported images of her have appeared—one in New Haven and the other in a London suburb—and she is once again at the center of a dispute.\n\nA few weeks before Christmas, in 2005, Christopher Foley, a London art dealer who specializes in early portraits, received a phone call from Sir John Guinness, who sits on the boards of several British art institutions. A man in Streatham, South London, had been writing letters to various museums claiming that he had a portrait of Jane Grey, and Guinness asked Foley to investigate. Foley is a tall, dishevelled, amiable man in his late fifties, who lives in an early-nineteenth-century house in Kensington. The walls are lined with English portraits. “It’s a truism in the business that there is no Lady Jane Grey portrait,” he told me. “The idea was to go shut the fellow up.”\n\nThat weekend, Foley drove in the rain to Streatham, a middle-class suburb near Wimbledon. The man who met him at the door, an artist, said that the picture had been bought by his great-grandfather, an antiques collector. They went up to the attic, where the portrait was resting on an easel. Foley recalled, “Within a moment, I knew it was right. I’ve sold over one thousand Jacobean and Tudor portraits. I knew the panel and the pigment were sixteenth-century.”\n\nThe picture Foley saw, now known as the Streatham portrait, was a three-quarter-length likeness, twenty-four inches wide by thirty-four inches high, of a slight, high-browed, brown-eyed adolescent girl, her red hair tucked behind a headband, in opulent Tudor dress, with patterns of gilt strawberries and fleurs-de-lis. She wore a necklace with hanging jewelled medallions finished with large teardrop pearls, and held a prayer book. In the upper left corner was the inscription, in gold pigment, “LADY JAYNE.” There was some damage: the mouth and the eyes had been deliberately scored, or so it appeared, with a sharp object.\n\nThe painting was uninspired—Foley thought it “a really bad picture”—and he said that while it might be a portrait of Jane Grey, he also believed that it was a later copy of a contemporary portrait. No painter of such limited talent, he felt, would have been given a court commission. It was more typical to find paintings of this journeymanlike quality later in the sixteenth century, when portraiture was more common, and more artists were working as copyists.\n\nBy the fifteenth century, the painting of life portraits, which had been dormant through the Middle Ages, had reappeared in Italy and the Netherlands, where it coincided with the Renaissance emphasis on the primacy of the individual. (In 1490, Leonardo described the portrait as a vehicle for expressing “the motions of the mind.”) But it wasn’t until 1526, when Hans Holbein, bearing an introduction from the philosopher Erasmus, arrived in London and painted Sir Thomas More and his family, that modern portraiture became established in England. (Earlier portraits of royalty, on seals and coins, made no attempt at true likeness.) It is impossible to estimate the exact number of portraits painted during the Tudor era, but only a fraction were made before 1558, when Elizabeth I ascended to the throne and through portraiture promoted her own image as the Virgin Queen.\n\nAccording to romantic convention, Lady Jane Grey was born in the same month as her cousin Edward, in October, 1537, at Bradgate Park, in Leicestershire. She was the third and first surviving child of Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset and later Duke of Suffolk, and Frances Brandon, the daughter of Mary Tudor—Henry VIII’s younger sister, who was briefly Queen of France. Jane was fifth in line to the throne. In early 1546, she became part of the household of Henry’s sixth and last wife, Catherine Parr, who treated her with affection, but Jane’s life was distinguished most by her precocity—she read Latin, French, Italian, Hebrew, and Greek—and by her parents’ ambition.\n\nIn 1548, her father sold her guardianship, for two thousand pounds, to Lord Thomas Seymour, an uncle of Prince Edward’s. Seymour’s plan was to marry Jane to Edward, who that year succeeded Henry VIII. Nothing came of it, although Seymour was executed (his plan involved kidnapping Edward), and Jane was sent back to Bradgate. In June of 1553, however, Edward, adamant that the crown not pass to his Catholic half sister, Mary, secretly drafted a Device for Succession, which made Jane his heir, and disinherited both Mary and his other half sister, Elizabeth. (Disinheriting only Mary, and not Elizabeth—who was also Protestant—was too transparent politically.) Edward was abetted by the president of his Privy Council, the Duke of Northumberland, who had his own agenda: in May, Jane had been married off to his son Guilford Dudley.\n\nEdward died on July 6, 1553, at the age of fifteen. When Northumberland told Jane that she was queen, she fell to the ground and wept. She later wrote that the moment left her “stupefied.” The only known contemporary physical description of Jane comes from Baptista Spinola, a Genoese visitor to London, who watched the cautious royal procession pass through the city the next day:\n\nThis Jane is very short and thin, but prettily shaped and graceful. She has small features and a well-made nose, the mouth flexible and the lips red. The eyebrows are arched and darker than her hair, which is nearly red. Her eyes are sparkling and reddish brown in colour. I stood so near her grace that I noticed her colour was good but freckled. When she smiled she showed her teeth, which are white and sharp. In all, a gracious and animated figure.\n\nMary, in Norfolk, gathered her troops. When Northumberland left London to capture her, a jittery Privy Council, foreseeing charges of treason, declared Mary queen. Jane’s own father signed the proclamation, then fled the city without her. As Mary and her troops entered London on August 3rd, Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley were arrested. Northumberland was executed. Jane spent seven months in the Tower; her parents neither wrote nor attempted to visit her. The day before her death, she wrote a goodbye letter to her younger sister (“Consider that I shall be delivered of this corruption”), on a page of a Greek New Testament.\n\nAfter seeing the portrait, Foley contacted the National Portrait Gallery, and in January, 2006, the Guardian reported that “experts are now claiming” that a picture found in southwest London was a portrait of Lady Jane Grey. Among those asked for comment was David Starkey, a popular historian and BBC television presenter, whose series include “The Six Wives of Henry VIII.” A fellow of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, he has also written several books on the Tudor period, and in June he was awarded a C.B.E. for service to history. (Starkey, who is sixty-two and wears horn-rimmed glasses and a habitual expression of incredulity, is also famously impolitic: his outbursts on the BBC program “The Moral Maze” have earned him the title in the tabloids of the “rudest man in Britain.”) Starkey told the Guardian that he was skeptical about the Streatham portrait, noting that it “doesn’t ‘sing.’ ”\n\nStarkey did not mention that that winter he, too, had an interest in Jane Grey. Starting in January, he was a consultant to the Philip Mould Gallery, in Mayfair, which specializes in historical portraits, for an exhibition to be called “Lost Faces.” Scheduled for March, 2007, the show, in which no works would be offered for sale, would highlight recent finds from the Tudor period. As Starkey later told me, “For ‘Lost Faces,’ we needed ‘found faces.’ ”\n\nOver the next few months, as Starkey was conducting his own research, Foley, in consultation with art historians and technical experts, prepared a report on the Streatham painting for the National Portrait Gallery. Through dendrochronology (the dating of wood through tree rings), they determined that the Baltic oak of the panel had been felled, aged, and used in the fifteen-nineties—almost forty years after Jane’s death. The pigments were contemporary with that period: the yellow lead pigment in the painting became rare after 1600.\n\nFoley’s guess that the painting was a copy of an earlier portrait had also been based on the sitter’s costume, which exactly replicates Tudor dress of the fifteen-fifties. Unless the painter, working forty years later, was copying an existing portrait, it would have been unlikely that he would have got the details right.\n\nWas the sitter Jane? The costume and the jewels mark her as a person of extremely high rank. Conservators determined that the inscription, “LADY JAYNE,” was painted when the background was wet—it wasn’t a later addition. According to the report, there were only four other women at court at that time named Lady Jane. Two were too young; a third would have used her husband’s surname, and a fourth lost her honorific after her father, the Earl of Surrey, was executed. Then, there were clues in the costume. The fleurs-de-lis and the gilt strawberries—which indicate the female grandchild of a sovereign—might link the sitter, if it was Jane Grey, to her grandmother Queen Mary of France. While no exact match for the jewels was found in the Tudor jewel inventory—a contemporary list of the jewels owned by the Royal Family—Mary and Elizabeth owned similar pieces. The damage to the painting had been most likely inflicted when the paint was still relatively soft: the scratches had sliced through the paint without splintering it. There appeared to be seventeen such scratches, made by a sharp blade, through the eyes, the nose, and the mouth, as if someone—possibly a Catholic partisan—had tried to obliterate the face. Also compelling to Foley was the fact that the girl in the picture matched Spinola’s description of Jane.\n\nIn April, Foley wrote up the findings, which confirmed his initial impressions, and sent a copy of them to Sir John Guinness, who suggested that he also send a copy to David Starkey. Starkey wrote to Foley that though he found the case interesting, he remained skeptical.\n\nIn November, the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery voted to buy the Streatham portrait, for ninety-five thousand pounds. Foley brokered the deal. (In the current art market, it wasn’t much: last year the Gallery raised 1.4 million pounds to purchase a contemporary portrait of John Donne.) There was one immediate objection—from Starkey. While earlier in the year he’d been noncommittal about the Streatham portrait, he now told the Guardian that not only was it an “appallingly bad picture,” but “there’s absolutely no reason to suppose it’s got anything to do with Lady Jane Grey. If the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, then so be it.” He added, “There’s no documentary evidence, no evidence from inventories, jewellery, or heraldry to support the idea this is Lady Jane Grey.”\n\nFoley responded in the Guardian that perhaps Starkey was annoyed that he hadn’t found the picture himself. Many people, Foley remarked, “know more about the science of painting than David Starkey.” As for the quality of the picture, he noted, “Who said all pictures of monarchs have to be masterpieces? Many contemporary portraits of Elizabeth I look like pub signs.” All the evidence needed, he said, was intrinsic to the painting itself.\n\nA few months earlier, it turned out, while researching the “Lost Faces” show for the Philip Mould Gallery, Starkey had made a discovery of his own. Bendor Grosvenor, a director at the gallery, told me, “David rang me up. He was breathless. He said, ‘I’ve found Lady Jane Grey!’ She was the Rosetta stone. I made, let’s say, a graphic exclamation of shock and excitement.”\n\nStarkey told Grosvenor that he had found a photograph of a miniature in a catalogue from a 1983 show at the Victoria and Albert Museum, “Artists of the Tudor Court: The Portrait Miniature Rediscovered.” He hadn’t seen the actual painting, but he was sure it was a contemporary portrait of Jane. Grosvenor found the catalogue in the gallery’s library. The show had been curated by Sir Roy Strong, who was then the director of the V. & A. The miniature was in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art, in New Haven. Describing the photograph, Grosvenor made a circle with his thumb and forefinger and brought it to his eye as if looking through a monocle. He laughed. “It was that small,” he said.\n\nThe round miniature, which is less than two inches in diameter, is of a young, full-faced woman with light-brown hair and blue eyes—Strong called her a “fully developed, tough teenager”—dressed in a severe black square-necked gown. Oak leaves, acorns, and what look like tiny yellow flowers, which Strong identified as cowslips, are tucked into her brooch, which features a black classical head set in gold. The arms are abnormally small, even spindly. A faint inscription reads “ANO XVIII.” The background is lapis blue. Strong suggested that the sitter might be Elizabeth I, and tentatively attributed the miniature to Levina Teerlinc, a Flemish painter attached to the Tudor court.\n\nThe identity of the sitter has long been questioned. The miniature was auctioned as one of a pair, of a husband and wife, at Sotheby’s London in 1970. (Both portraits were then attributed to the court painter Lucas Horenbout; Strong disagreed that the sitters were a couple, and attributed the male portrait to Hans Holbein.) The miniatures were subsequently bought by Paul Mellon, and in 1974 he donated them to Yale.\n\nIn August, Philip Mould wrote to Amy Meyers, the director of the Yale Center for British Art, to request a loan of the female portrait miniature for “Lost Faces.” Meyers told me, “We thought it was an interesting thesis. But we were in no way endorsing David’s opinion.”\n\nAs a historian, Starkey has been particularly interested in young monarchs—his book “Elizabeth I” focusses on that queen’s early years. Last June, he told me, “I’m interested in lives. One of the elements of biography is portraiture—however much phrenology is a pseudoscience, we tend to need faces. The challenge became to find an image of Jane Grey. I literally began trawling.” He added, “I was looking at Roy Strong’s book, and I thought, Eureka! I’m ninety per cent sure.”\n\nWhen I asked him about the Streatham portrait, he told me, “What I’ve said is that it doesn’t matter, because it’s such a bad picture. Why have such a portrait? For the National Portrait Gallery, it’s a trophy. It turns curatorship into philately. It’s a late, scruffy, unrecognizable portrait of something or other. It doesn’t matter if the attribution is correct.”\n\nThe Streatham portrait was not the first picture of Jane Grey to show up in the National Portrait Gallery. The archives are full of copies of spurious images, and a full-length portrait identified as Jane hung in the Gallery for thirty years, until 1996, when the red-haired sitter, who also resembled the Spinola description, was re-identified as Catherine Parr, after the necklace in the painting was found in the list of her jewels in the Tudor inventory. (The question remains, though, of whether Catherine could have lent Jane the jewels.) __\n\nThe Streatham portrait was hung in the Tudor Gallery. One morning last June, it was filled with schoolchildren gaping at the kings and queens. In the gallery’s low light, the red and gold of the portrait looks bleached; the slight figure has the flat face of a paper doll. Tarnya Cooper, the Gallery’s curator of Tudor paintings, told me, “We now think this picture may have been one of a set of Protestant martyrs, a memorial picture painted shortly after her death.” She added, “We’re the first to admit it’s a paint-by-number, labored copy. David Starkey is a colorful character, and his reaction to this is, let’s say, colorful.” She smiled, and said, “I don’t know if he’s come to see this, and there’s been no correspondence at all with the Gallery. But we have a wider remit than exquisite portraiture: this is a historical document, and it’s unlikely that a lifetime portrait will surface. For Lady Jane Grey, there was an incredibly small window in which her portrait might be painted, after which things fell apart.”\n\nThe miniature, which Starkey still had not seen for himself, was taken to London in February, and “Lost Faces” opened on March 7th. Spurred in part by newspaper headlines (“THE GIRL WHO WAS A QUEEN FOR NINE DAYS”), more than a thousand people attended the show during its two-week run. In an essay in the show’s catalogue, Starkey, Grosvenor, and the Tudor expert Alasdair Hawkyard contend that the brooch worn by the sitter is on the list of Jane Grey’s jewels in the inventory, and that the sprigs tucked into it, which are identified as gillyflowers and oak leaves with acorns, represent, respectively, Guilford Dudley, her husband, and Robert Dudley, her brother-in-law. (Gillyflowers, they explain, were Guilford’s emblem, and acorns were Robert’s.) They also suggest that the austere black gown worn by the sitter might have been an outward display of Jane’s Protestant piety. They argue, too, that the inscription “ANO XVIII” means that the sitter was in the eighteenth year of her life, and that “Jane could thus have been seventeen at the time of her nine-day reign,” and they cite evidence that her age when she died, conventionally sixteen, should be revisited.\n\nSix days later, a long letter from Christopher Foley appeared in the London Antiques Trade Gazette. He challenged the evidence on all counts: her brooch (he said it was not the brooch in the inventory, and, in any case, such pieces were common in the mid-sixteenth century); the flora (Tudor women, he said, did not wear the emblems of their brothers-in-law); and her age (he dates the dress in the painting to 1542-46, when Jane would have been, at most, eleven). He also remarked on the discrepancy between the sitter’s appearance—brown hair, blue eyes—and Spinola’s description of Jane.\n\nFurther, on the question of Jane’s age at her death, Foley cited research by an American historian, Stephan Edwards. Edwards agrees that Jane was born before October, 1537: the documented presence of her mother, Frances Brandon, at the funeral of Jane Seymour, the mother of Edward VI, who died two weeks after Edward was born, makes a shared birthdate for Jane and Edward impossible—Tudor women did not appear in public for forty days after giving birth. But if Jane was seventeen, or even just turned eighteen, as Edwards’s recent discovery of a reference by Jane’s Italian tutor may suggest, then the miniature was painted when Jane was being held in the Tower. Starkey thinks that if the portrait was not made while Jane was queen, then it could have been painted after her arrest. Edwards counters, “Jane had the potential to become a Protestant martyr. Why would Mary have allowed it? No person in the sixteenth century had his or her portrait painted in the Tower. To a historian, unique is alarming. And that dress! At court, it would have been like dressing as a goth to go to the White House!” He groaned. “Of course, the really frustrating thing is that it can all be wrong.”\n\nThe Yale miniature was on view this past summer in New Haven, in a show called “Paul Mellon’s Legacy: A Passion for British Art.” The wall copy read “Portrait of a lady, possibly Lady Jane Grey, ca. 1553,” and attributed the conjecture to David Starkey’s recent “interesting possibility.” Scott Wilcox, Yale’s curator for prints and drawings, told me that the miniature wasn’t originally part of the show, “but, given her recent notoriety, we put her in.”\n\nWhen I asked Sir Roy Strong, who wrote about the miniature for the Victoria and Albert show, about the latest dispute over Jane Grey, he told me, “She’s a celebrity, and she came to a sticky end.” He laughed. “There’s an industry, always, for distinguished, educated women who get their heads chopped off.” ♦"
