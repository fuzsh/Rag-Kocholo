        "text": "Lady Jane Grey (c. 1537 – 12 February 1554), also known as Lady Jane Dudley (after her marriage) and as \"the Nine Days' Queen\", was an English noblewoman and de facto Queen of England and Ireland from 10 July until 19 July 1553.\n\nAfter Edward's death, Jane was proclaimed queen on 10 July 1553 and awaited coronation in the Tower of London. Support for Mary grew very quickly, and most of Jane's supporters abandoned her. The Privy Council of England suddenly changed sides and proclaimed Mary as queen on 19 July 1553, deposing Jane. Her primary supporter, her father-in-law the Duke of Northumberland, was accused of treason and executed less than a month later. Jane was held prisoner at the Tower and was convicted in November 1553 of high treason, which carried a sentence of death—though Mary initially spared her life. However, Jane soon became viewed as a threat to the Crown when her father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, got involved with Wyatt's rebellion against Queen Mary's intention to marry Philip II of Spain. Both Jane and her husband were executed on 12 February 1554.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey\n\nAvailable a pretty 1986 British costume-drama romance film of her story\n\nPrayer Book: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=Lady+Jane+Grey+Ghost&&view=det...\n\n===============================Biography================================\n\nLady Jane Grey, Queen of England (disputed) was born circa October 12, 1537 in Bradgate Park, Charwood Forest, Leicestershire, England. Her parents were Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, 3rd Marquess of Dorset and Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk. She was a Queen of England, Queen of England for 9 days, Queen.\n\nJane married Lord Guilford Dudley on May 21, 1553 in Durham House,London,England.\n\nShe died on February 12, 1554 in Tower Green, inside the Tower of London, England from Execution and was buried in 1554 in Chapel of St Peter-ad-Vincula, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, Greater London, England, United Kingdom.\n\nThe question of whether or not she was actually queen hinges on her legal standing. Though Edward had named her as his successor, the laws of succession, as ratified by Parliament in 1543,had established the line as going to Mary and then Elizabeth, and the king had no right to change the succession without the consent of Parliament.\n\nFind-a-Grave Memorial #1971, Chapel of Saint Peter-ad-Vincula, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, Greater London, England\n\n[http://www.thepeerage.com/p10152.htm]\n\nLady Jane Grey was born in October 1537 at Bradgate Manor, Bradgate, Leicestershire, England.\n\nShe was also reported to have been born in 1536.\n\nShe was the daughter of Sir Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Lady Frances Brandon.

Hereinafter cited as Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey\n\nKnown as The Nine Days' Queen, was an English noblewoman who occupied the English throne from 10 until 19 July 1553 and was executed for high treason.\n\nContradicting the Succession Act, which restored Mary and Elizabeth to the line of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary, as his successor. Lady Jane's mother was Frances Brandon, who was Mary's cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne. Instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into East Anglia, where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down Kett's Rebellion. Many adherents to the Catholic faith, opponents of Dudley, lived there. On 9 July, from Kenninghall, Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward's successor.\n\nOn 10 July 1553, Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by Dudley and his supporters, and on the same day Mary's letter to the council arrived in London. By 12 July, Mary and her supporters had assembled a military force at Framlingham Castle, Suffolk. Dudley's support collapsed, and Mary's grew. Jane was deposed on 19 July. She and Dudley were imprisoned in the Tower of London. Mary rode triumphantly into London on 3 August 1553 on a wave of popular support. She was accompanied by her half-sister Elizabeth, and a procession of over 800 nobles and gentlemen. wikipedia.\n\nLady Jane Grey had an excellent humanist education and a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day. A committed Protestant, she was posthumously regarded as not only a political victim but akin to a martyr."
