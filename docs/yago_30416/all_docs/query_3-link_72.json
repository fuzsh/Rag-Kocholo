        "text": "Does Lord Guildford Dudley (Edward Bluemel) die in My Lady Jane Season 1? The historical fantasy drama series has left the audience with numerous emotions and questions. Given Guildford’s tumultuous journey throughout the episodes, fans are curious what becomes of him in the Season 1 finale.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about My Lady Jane Season 1 and what happened to Lord Guildford Dudley’s character in the show. Did he die or did he survive?\n\nDoes Lord Guildford Dudley die in My Lady Jane Season 1?\n\nNo, Lord Guildford Dudley does not die in My Lady Jane Season 1. Instead, he escapes execution with the help of Ethians.\n\nThe show, which reimagines the historical true story of Lady Jane Grey, offers a surprising twist where both Jane and Guildford escape their tragic fates. In the final episodes, just as their executions are about to take place, the Ethians — humans who can turn into animals — come to the rescue. Guildford is about to be burned at the stake, when the Ethians cause enough chaos to save both him and Jane.\n\nThis thrilling escape leads to a happier ending for the couple. Guildford transforms into a horse, showing his love and determination to survive. Jane leaps onto his back, and together they ride away from the castle. Their escape leaves their future open-ended but hopeful, much better than their historical counterparts.\n\nMy Lady Jane Season 1 wraps up with Jane and Guildford alive and free. Moreover, it sets up the possibility of more adventures for the pair in the future. This reimagined tale offers a hopeful and adventurous twist, setting the stage for potential future installments of the show. With its engaging blend of history and fantasy, the series leaves viewers eagerly anticipating what comes next for Jane and Guildford."
