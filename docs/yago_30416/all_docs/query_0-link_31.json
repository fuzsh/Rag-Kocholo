In 1547, Jane became a ward to Thomas Seymour, whom married Katherine soon after. Thomas planned with Jane's father to have her married to her cousin King Edward. Jane had no desire to be queen though her guardians had little care for her wishes. After Thomas's execution, Jane's father aligned himself with John Dudley whom Jane deeply mistrusted. She was forced Jane to marry Dudley's son, Guildford, in May 1553. Following Edward's death, Jane was declared queen by the Privy Council but only ruled for nine days before Mary was declared the rightful queen.\n\nSupporting characters[]\n\nEdward VI[]\n\nMain article: Edward VI\n\nEdward VI (October 1537 – 6 July 1553)[1] was Lady Jane Grey's favorite cousin and the son of King Henry VIII. After his father's death in January 1547, Edward was crowned King of England at the age of nine. His uncle, Edward Seymour, and the Privy Council were appointed to help Edward rule England due to his young age. Edward later grew to respect and look up to John Dudley, whom replaced Seymour as regent after he was imprisoned for attempting to kidnap Edward. Towards the end of his life, Edward grew very weak and sickly. Sometime before his death in 1553, he named Jane as his successor because she was protestant and therefore disinherited his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth.\n\nFrances and Henry Grey[]\n\nFrances and Henry Grey[3] (\"Mother\" and \"Father\") were the parents of Jane, Katherine, and Mary. She was also a niece of King Henry. He was the Marquess of Dorset, and later the Duke of Suffolk. They were both harsh with their children, especially Jane whom they sometimes punished with whippings. Unlike her husband, Frances was reluctant to release Jane into the care of Thomas Seymour. Following Seymour's execution, the Greys aligned themselves with John Dudley. They forced Jane to marry his son and later supported the campaign for her to become queen. Following Mary's return, Frances was allowed to leave and Henry was pardoned. He was imprisoned again and executed after joining Wyatt's Rebellion.\n\nGuildford Dudley[]\n\nGuildford Dudley (died 12 February 1554)[1] was the son of John Dudley. He was pampered by his mother, which often caused him to act like a child. Guildford married Lady Jane Grey on 25 May 1553. She chose to live at her parents' home and visited him very little during their first months of marriage. When Jane was declared queen, Guildford desired to be named King and rule beside her. She refused and said that she would make him a duke. When Mary became queen instead, Guildford and Jane were imprisoned in the Tower of London. They became closer during their visits in the garden, but they never saw each other again after Mary sentenced them to death. He was executed on the same day as his wife.\n\nJohn Dudley[]\n\nJohn Dudley (died 22 August 1553)[4] was the Earl of Warwick and later the Duke of Northumberland. He was married and had several children, including Robert and Guildford. Under Edward's reign, John quickly gained the new king's favor. He was likely behind the downfall of Edward Seymour, which left the path clear for John to become the de facto regent. In mid-1553, John arranged for Guildford to marry Lady Jane Grey. After Edward passed away, John had Jane declared queen and led her army against Mary's forces. He was later imprisoned at the Tower and sentenced to death. He attempted to gain sympathy from Mary by converting to Catholicism, but was still ultimately executed.\n\nKatherine Parr[]\n\nMain article: Catherine Parr\n\nKatherine Parr (c. 1512[5] – 5 September 1548)[6] was the widow of the late King Henry. She was close to Lady Jane Grey, and her stepchildren, Elizabeth, Edward, and Mary. Katherine married Thomas Seymour just a few months after King Henry's death. She and Thomas were subsequently not welcome at court due to their hasty marriage. Jane and Elizabeth lived with the couple and Katherine oversaw their educations. By May 1548, Katherine was expecting her first child. Katherine later had Elizabeth sent away, possibly due to Thomas's inappropriate behavior towards her. Katherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary, on 30 August. She died a week later of childbed fever. Jane was the chief mourner at her funeral.\n\nMary I[]\n\nMain article: Mary I\n\nMary I (born 1516)[1] was Jane's cousin and the daughter of the late King Henry. Jane was not particularly fond of Mary, describing her as \"thin and old and shortsighted and talks like a man.\" Mary was a fervent Catholic and continued to practice her religion, despite the increasing reforms. She was disinherited by her brother's will, which he wrote just before his death in July 1553. Their cousin Jane was declared queen and Mary fled to gather support. A little over a week later, Mary was declared the rightful Queen of England and brought to the Tower of London. She was inclined to pardon Jane and Guildford. However, after Thomas Wyatt's rebellion, Mary had them both sentenced to death.\n\nThomas Seymour[]\n\nThomas Seymour (died 19 March 1549)[7] was the uncle of King Edward and husband of Katherine Parr. He was jealous of his brother, Edward Seymour, whom was made Lord Protector which essentially made him Edward's regent. Thomas was granted the title of Lord Admiral. In early 1547, Lady Jane Grey became his ward. He plotted with her parents to have her marry his nephew, which did not work out. He married King Henry's widow, Katherine, shortly later. Their only daughter was born in August 1548. Thomas was devastated when his wife passed away of childbed fever.
