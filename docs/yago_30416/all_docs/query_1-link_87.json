The fact, indeed, against the queen’s highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but touching the procurement and desire thereof by me or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency, before God and the face of you, good Christian people, this day.” – Lady Jane Grey\n\nI honestly don’t think I’ve been this excited and thrilled about a television show in such a long time! In today’s post, I’m so beyond happy to share the upcoming trailer to Amazon Prime’s new series about the young Lady Jane Grey which will be airing later this month on June 27th! I’ve been giddy since I saw the trailer! This new show reimagines history. This fresh take poses intriguing questions: What if Jane had foreseen her fate? Could she have evaded the executioner’s axe and Queen Mary Tudor’s fury?\n\nIt’s a concept I’ve yearned for, reminiscent of the 1986 film ‘Lady Jane’ starring Helena Bonham Carter. Another adaptation has been a very long-held hope of mine! Historical fiction holds a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to dive into this new series.\n\nMy Lady Jane aims to reimagine the tragic tale of a would-be queen. A woman caught up in a disaster beyond her control. It blends historical intrigue with playful storytelling. At the heart of this fresh narrative is Lady Jane, the sharp-witted heroine whose life takes an unexpected turn when her cruel and ambitious mother arranges a marriage. The groom is the notorious playboy Guildford Dudley. What will follow is a riveting journey filled to the brim with love, secrets, and scandal that threaten the very foundation of English court. My Lady Jane is a series that promises to enchant, surprise, and remind us that even the most doomed can rewrite their destiny!\n\nNow with all that said, I am all too aware that this series won’t be to everybody taste and liking. It won’t be historically accurate at it’s core. That’s not the point of the show. The intent behind My Lady Jane is to be a funny, empowering, and adventorous historical what-if. A question of what might have been a very different version of Jane’s tragic life. I couldn’t be more pleased with the concept. I have every hope in my soul that this series will prove to be entertaining. My excitment is very real. The series trailer is posted below!\n\nIMDB Summary:\n\nWhen her ambitious mother sells Jane’s hand to the highest bidder, Jane is dismayed to discover that her dreaded husband-to-be, Guildford Dudley, is an infuriatingly attractive stranger with a dark secret; one that has the potential to get them both killed.\n\nNot to mention the fact that there are greater conspiracies afoot, like a plot to murder her cousin, King Edward, and throw the entire kingdom into chaos. A sharp-tongued, warm-hearted story full of romance, adventure, and fantasy, My Lady Jane reveals that true love is real, people are not always what they seem, and even doomed heroines can save themselves. That hope can live on.\n\nMy Lady Jane is the first in a series of six young adult books, The Lady Janeis, by co-authors Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, and Jodi Meadows. The books reimagine the lives (and fates) of famous historical figures, from Lady Jane Grey to Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nBOOK SYNOPSIS:\n\nThis comical, fantastical, romantical, New York Times bestselling, (not) entirely true story of Lady Jane Grey is “an uproarious historical fantasy that’s not to be missed” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).\n\nIn My Lady Jane, coauthors Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, and Jodi Meadows have created a one-of-a-kind YA fantasy in the tradition of The Princess Bride, featuring a reluctant king, an even more reluctant queen, a noble steed, and only a passing resemblance to actual history—because sometimes history needs a little help.\n\nAt sixteen, Lady Jane Grey is about to be married off to a stranger and caught up in a conspiracy to rob her cousin, King Edward, of his throne. But those trifling problems aren’t for Jane to worry about. Jane gets to be Queen of England.\n\nLike that could go wrong.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET A COPY OF THE BOOK\n\n© Samantha James and The Chronicles of History: Reading Into Our Past, 2023.
