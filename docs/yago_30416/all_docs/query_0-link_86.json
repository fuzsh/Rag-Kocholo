        "text": "On February 12, 1554, a sixteen-year-old Lady Jane Gray died. She had been Queen of England for nine days. Yet she is fairly unknown. Who was she?\n\nLady Jane Gray, born in Bradgate Park in Leicestershire in September 1537, was a daughter of Henry Gray (3rd Marquis of Dorset) and of Lady Francis Brandon (cousin of King Henry VIII). How could she become a queen?\n\nSituation in Engeland\n\nAt the time of the death of King Edward VI, the only son of Henry VIII, in 1553, Protestantism in England had gained so much support that the heir to the throne, Edward’s elder sister, the Catholic Lady Mary (daughter of Catherine of Aragon) would be a great danger. John Dudley, the Duke of Northumberland, Edward’s guardian, put a stop to it and helped Edward designate a new successor to the throne: Lady Jane Gray. Not coincidentally, Jane was recently married to his own son Lord Guilford Dudley.\n\nMaybe this family tree can clarify the situation a bit:\n\nQueen\n\nLady Jane was proclaimed the new Queen on July 10, 1553, a few days after Edward’s death, but it was not meant to go well. The people’s sympathy lay with the Catholic Princess Mary and she soon won her crown back. Lady Jane had been queen for only nine days…\n\nTower of London\n\nLady Jane was captured, along with her husband and father-in-law. At first she was allowed to live, but after the Wyatt uprising, organized by her own father, she was sentenced to death and beheaded on February 12, 1554.\n\nThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey by Paul Delaroche (1833)\n\nLady Jane\n\nThese are the historical facts and little is known about her character. What we do know is that Lady Jane Gray had received excellent training and had a reputation as one of the most learned young women of her day. There are several books written about her, but often these are too romanticized to my liking.\n\nThe Sisters Who Would be Queen: Mary, Katherine, and Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Tragedy by Leanda de Lisle is a really good book about her.\n\nThe Last Tudor, by Philippa Gregory is a historical roman about Lady Jane and her two sisters. I’m considering writing a blog about them. Let me know if you are interested!\n\nInnocent Traitor by Alison Weir\n\nFinally, a movie tip: Lady Jane with fantastic actress Helena Bonham Carter in de lead. The movie is from 1986 but absolutely worth it!\n\nHave a look at my Pinterest bord for more pictures:"
