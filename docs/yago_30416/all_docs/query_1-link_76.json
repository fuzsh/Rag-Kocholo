        "text": "Please note that the TimeRef website is currently being redesigned.\n\nLady Jane Grey, the Nine Days' Queen\n\nTweet\n\nady Jane Grey was the daughter of Henry Grey, the Duke of Suffolk. Henry was related through his great-grandmother, Elizabeth Woodville, to King Edward IV of England whom she married. Elizabeth Woodville was married first to Sir John Grey who died in 1461 and had a son, Thomas Grey, who was forced into exile by King Richard III. When Henry VII became king, Thomas Grey returned to England and was granted the title Marquess of Dorset.\n\nLady Jane's mother was Frances Brandon, the daughter of Mary Tudor and Charles, Duke of Suffolk. Mary Tudor was the younger sister of King Henry VIII and had married the much older King of France Louis XII. Their marriage was quickly ended when the French King died. She then married Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, Lady Jane's father.\n\nThrough her links to King Henry VIII Jane was also first cousin once removed of Prince Edward, the future King Edward VI of England, and his sisters Mary Tudor and Elizabeth, both of whom would become queens of England.\n\nJane was born in around 1537 possibly at her father's estate Bradgate in Leicestershire. She was given an exceptional education by her tutor Aylmer, the future Bishop of London. Under his guidance she was acquainted with the Scriptures and the Reformation. Edward VI, her cousin, was a companion and they most likely shared lessons together. Her love of learning led her to prefer to read and solitude rather than the pageant that would have been more normal for a young noble child.\n\nThe life of Lady Jane was forever altered by the death of King Henry VIII. When Henry died his son Edward became King of England. Edward was only nine years old when he was crowned and too young to rule the country unaided so he was appointed a protector to govern England on his behalf. He was Edward Seymour, the duke of Somerset. The Duke of Somerset was the brother of Jane Seymour, Edward's mother and because he was the uncle of the new king, was made Lord Protector.\n\nBut the duke of Somerset had a rival, John Dudley, the duke of Northumberland. Dudley had been given the title of Earl of Warwick and had fought bravely in the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh where the Scots were badly defeated forcing Mary Queen of Scots to be hidden at Inchmahome Priory located on an island on lake Menteith."
