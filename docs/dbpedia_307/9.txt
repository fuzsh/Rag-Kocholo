The first records of the word courage come from the 1200s. It comes from the Old French corage, from cuer, meaning “heart” (this ultimately derives from the Latin cor, meaning “heart”).

The heart is traditionally depicted as the center of human emotion, and the word heart is commonly used in a figurative way to refer to courage or bravery—someone who has courage is said to have a lot of heart. Being courageous means that even when a situation is dangerous or scary—when it makes your heart start beating very fast—you’re still willing to face it. But courage doesn’t always involve facing danger. Something as simple as telling the truth when it will result in negative consequences can be courageous.

Courage is always used positively. It’s associated with heroic people and actions—like firefighters running into burning buildings to save people—but it can be used in many different situations.
