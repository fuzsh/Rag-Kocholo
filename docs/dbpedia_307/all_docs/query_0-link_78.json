        "text": "A: He is referencing the stories of Homer and the heroic figures he has read about in the past. He is saying that he thinks people are not the same as they once were, not as strong physically and psychologically. He is wondering how he will perform as a soldier when tested. Will he be courageous?\n\nA: Initially, Henry is drawn to enlist by the thrills he expects to experience in war. He thinks that it will be exciting and he expects that it will soon be over, so he wants to join it before it is too late. He is somewhat na√Øve about war and he imagines himself doing great deeds with his \"eagle-eyed prowess\".\n\nA: Henry's mother wants him to stay and work on the farm. She reluctantly accepts the inevitable when he tells her that he is going off to war and tells him to stay away from anyone who has bad values. She tells him that she has packed him extra socks, hardly the exciting \"come back with your shield or upon it\" that Henry would like to hear. (Remember the expression \"Come back with your shield or upon it\" as a phrase from the Greek tradition. It suggests that you should fight to the death rather than run from danger, hence return with your shield victorious or upon it dead.)\n\nA. Henry thinks war will be thrilling and exciting like what he has read about in stories. He begins to lose his enthusiasm when what happens initially is just a lot of waiting: a \"blue demonstration\". They drill and wait for a lengthy period of time.\n\nA: Will I be courageous? Will I be able to fight bravely? His internal conflict centers around how he perceives himself. In some ways he is still a child at the beginning of the novel because he has not tested himself and he is very uncertain of himself. He looks to others to measure himself and his success. He lacks confidence and he is pretty self-centered.\n\nA: The monster that he refers to here is the terrible monster of war. He also calls war a terrible machine that tears men up and spits them out and he refers to a it as a terrible war god. Remember all that imagery of fiendish eyes looking out at him from the darkness and all the talk of the monster devouring or eating Henry and his men? That all refers to the monster of war.\n\n\"The battle was like the grinding of an immense and terrible machine to him. Its complexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated him. He must go close and see it produce corpses\" (57).\n\n\"The torn bodies expressed the awful machinery in which the men had been entangled\" (58).\n\n\"The brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths of the war god. What manner of men were they anyhow\" (49).\n\nA: They have been fighting longer and are a mixed lot of men who joined the army at various different points in time. Henry's regiment is new and fresh and this is visible through the way they are dressed. This shows that many men died in the Civil War and that it was not the glorious endeavor Henry expected it to be.\n\nA: Henry feels carried along physically because he is part of a collective group moving in one direction. This is not, however, the only force that influences his behavior. He is also influenced by expectations placed upon a soldier and hence placed upon him. He feels a strong sense of responsibility and wants to do the right thing as he heads into battle. He strongly identifies with the group and is starting to feel a bond to the group that later leads him to say that he feels like a part of a hand.\n\n\"But instantly he saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from the regiment. It enclosed him. And there were iron laws of tradition and law on four sides. He was in a moving box\"(24).\n\nA: This goes along with the references to the monster of war. Dragons in stories typically are defeated by brave and gallant knights. Remember, Henry's perceptions of what a hero is relate directly to those stories. At times when he is experiencing success, he sees himself as a knight slaying dragons.\n\n\"To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubtable dragons. He became like the man who lost his legs at the approach of the red and green monster. He waited in a sort of a horrified, listening attitude. He seemed to shut his eyes and wait to be gobbled\" (46).\n\n\"the initial morsels for the dragons would be then those who were following him\" (47).\n\n\"As he listened, he imagined them to have rows of cruel teeth that grinned at him\" (47).\n\nThe snakes and serpents are images that create a tone that is suspenseful. They suggest the danger that lies ahead and they relate to the fears that lurk in Henry's mind. The narrator describes the movements of the troops with words that relate to snakes because they move in lines in a way that resembles the movement of a snake. These are repeated symbols in the story that we see in many chapters; repeated patterns that become symbolically important are referred to as motifs.\n\n\"The blue smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake stepped upon. It swung its ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.\"\n\nA: \"Regarding it, he saw that it was fine, wild, and, in some ways, easy. He had been a tremendous figure, no doubt. By this struggle he had overcome obstacles which he had admitted to be mountains. They had fallen like paper peaks, and he was now what he called a hero. And he had not been aware of the process. He had slept and, awakening, found himself a knight.\" When Henry experiences some success in battle he begins to see himself as a knight. A knight slays dragons right? What is significant about how Henry overstates his success here? Does this remind you of his earlier notions of war? Remember, but a few pages later, he learns that the generals see him and his men as \"mule drivers\".\n\nA: Nature is sometimes capitalized when the author is referring to it as a proper noun, like Mother Nature. Remember, personification adds layers of meaning to writing. Sometimes the narrator personifies nature like after Henry runs and he sees the squirrel and thinks that Nature is sending him a sign that it was a prudent and intelligent thing to run when faced with danger (a \"sagacious\" thing). There are many places where nature imagery contributes to the tone of the novel. The blue sky is often shown in contrast to the smoke and the carnage (death, bodies, destruction) of the battlefield. In spite of the war, nature remains constant in her tranquility and beauty. Nature is also a motif in the story.\n\nA: No, it is not really a chapel, just like a chapel because it is a little safe, calm, seemingly guarded place of tranquility away from the war. This is where Henry finds the body of an anonymous soldier. The soldier has been left behind and has ants crawling all over its jaw. The soles of his shoes are worn off showing the difficulties he as endured. This image reminds Henry that war is not the glorious thing that he once thought it was. It is arduous, difficult, and many die lonely deaths. This soldier is not coming home to a parade and accolades, nor is he being buried with glory and honors. This is the reality of war that Henry is now coming to understand."
