        "text": "Hope and courage are two feelings that are only powerful when used together. To be courageous and not hopeful is a suicide mission; on the other hand, having hope and no courage will never give one the urge to oppose the problem. In Markus Zusak’s novel The Book Thief, the whole story is the epitome of courage and hope. During the second world war, the young Liesel Meminger is adopted by the Hubermann family, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, who teach her the power of words, as well as the importance of kindness. Moreover, one of the themes of this novel is the creation of hope from courage, and it is shown through the author’s use of symbolism, allegory, as well as irony. The use of symbolism is very important in this novel to show courage and …show more content…\n\nFor example, after the book burning, there were some books that were too wet to burn, and Liesel took advantage of this moment, “When she reached her hand, she was bitten, but on the second attempt, she made sure she was fast enough. She latched onto the closest of the books. It was hot” (Zusak 120). Jewish book burnings were popular across Germany during this time, as they were trying to destroy the power of the Jewish community. During the novel, Liesel is empowered by the words she reads in these books, and even shares this power with Max Vandenburg, the Jewish man living in her basement. The courage Liesel shares with Max allows him to build the hope he needs to want to fight Hitler. During his dreams, he imagines himself in a boxing ring with Hilter, and even though Hilter had the upper hand during the match, Max had hope that he would win, and therefore in his dream “he punched him [Hitler] seven times, aiming on each occasion for only one thing. The mustache” (Zusak 253). As previously mentioned, the accordian was also a very important form of symbolism in this novel. Not only does give the family hope during their …show more content…\n\nThere are many characters of allegorical nature in this novel, though two of the most important are Hans Hubermann, as well as Viktor Chemell. Hans Hubermann as an allegory represents the resistance against the S.S. forces. From the start of the novel, Hans clung to his morals for dear life, never wanting to let them go, even when it caused him to be drafted into the S.S. army. His is the emobdiement of the German resistance, and therefore courage and hope for all, as he did everything he could to suppose those he saw that needed help, even helping a random Jewish man that looked sickly, even close to death, so “Hans Hubermann held his hand out and presented a piece of bread, like magic” (Zusak 394). For this, Hans and the Jewish man were both punished by being whipped, and Max even left their house in order to protect the family from being caught, as Hans was already being called “a Jew love” (Zusak 395), and there was a lot of fear of the army searching their house for evidence against them, so that they could be sent to the camps as well. As for young Viktor Chemmel, he and his friends show resemblance of Hitler and his main group of followers. They knew who was poor, and therefore who did not have access to food, even if he himself was extremely rich and needed nothing else, and even acts like he deserves everything, saying “We must take what is rightfully ours!”"
