Every driven person eventually figures out that there's a whole lot of feel-good time wasters out there that suck us because they feel like work, and browsing endless lists of motivational phrases are no exception. And yet, there's hidden value in finding a concise expression that perfectly distills our own beliefs.\n\nMotivational quotes often feel like our own opinions making a return visit, just augmented by someone with writing talent. And the right quote at the right time can change things—words matter, and motivating phrases can encourage us to get up, overcome tough times, take action, be courageous, escape our comfort zone, practice self kindness, invest in self development, start a business, and do the hard work that needs doing.\n\nEven genuinely successful people show some reverence to a favourite quote or many —to get through hard times, remember an important personal principle, or even get some inspiration to keep moving forward. In business and life, quotes are short bits of wit, courage and wisdom that are easy to revisit when we need them.\n\nBest motivational quotes to start your day\n\n“You can get everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” —Zig Ziglar\n\n“Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working.” —Pablo Picasso\n\n“Don't settle for average.

Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.” —Helen Keller\n\nWhat have been my greatest life lessons?\n\nWho do I want to be? What do I want to stand for with this limited time left in my life (I am still young!)? How can I call into my courage and kindness each day?\n\nI think about these questions every day.\n\nNow, what would I tell my younger leadership self?\n\nI would tell her many different things and here are my greatest life lessons.\n\nIn a nutshell here are my 51 big lessons (and I have stuffed up plenty too!) -\n\nLife goes past so quickly; lead and life an authentic, amazing, brave, challenging and fun life everyday.\n\nDo one thing each day that makes your heart sing.\n\nDon't wait for the right time to do something, just do it.\n\nYou will lose friends in your life and do it sooner if they are putting holes in your rowboat.\n\nYou will grow more if you don't take things personally.\n\nLearn from people who have already created a great life, business and career. Get a coach and mentor too!\n\nAll you need is action and perseverance - and self-discipline.\n\nLearn to love yourself completely and embrace your own company.\n\nKnow your values and live and breath them.\n\nFocusing on your dreams can be difficult however just do it!\n\nBe trustworthy always.\n\nFake it until you become it.\n\nPractice self-reflection everyday.\n\nChoose your life partner and those job roles carefully.\n\nAlways be hopeful and compassionate.\n\nBe the best, most empowering and positive person you know.\n\nDon't ruminate over the small stuff as it will pass.\n\nLeave the phone alone for important meetings and moments.\n\nBe humble always. This is fundamental.\n\nTreat people how you want to be treated.\n\nNo regrets. No failure. Only lessons and learnings.\n\nBe courageous. When you look back on life, you’ll regret the things you didn’t do more than the ones you did.\n\nCelebrate the small achievements and success.\n\nFocus on what is in your circles of control and influence only.\n\nBe brave. Even if you’re not, pretend to be. No one can tell the difference.\n\nLeadership isn't a title, it is a choice and attitude.\n\nHave the best attitude every day. You choose your attitude.\n\nLearn and open yourself to who you truly are. This self-discovery journey never ends.\n\nPick up a great book and start reading it. I still read 100's of books on leadership every year!\n\nLearn about yourself. Self-awareness is the greatest capability.\n\nIntegrity is central to everything. Lead by example.\n\nOwn your story. It does not define you, but your story makes you who you are.\n\nOwn what makes you different and unique and just rock it!\n\nTrust your natural ability – you can do it.\n\nBelieve in yourself – confidence truly does rocks.\n\nDon’t take no for an answer. If they say no, go to the next. Find that yes.\n\nSurround yourself with empowering people who lift you higher and you can learn from.\n\nGive more to others. If you are successful, don’t forget to send the elevator down for others to ride up in.\n\nLeadership and life is about supporting others to do more, learn more and be more.\n\nTalk to strangers and connect more to others. A simple hello can go a long way.\n\nAsk great questions and listen. Great curiosity is the key.\n\nEmbrace vulnerability and ask for help. Offer help where you can and it is totally okay to cry.\n\nNever stop learning and invest in yourself. Growth mindset is key however Benefit mindset is even greater.\n\nRemember even the tougher of times can teach us something. See learnings in everything.\n\nNever lose an opportunity to say thank you, or I love you.\n\nKindness is an absolute superpower.\n\nFollow your instincts, but don’t discount others’ opinions.\n\nBe respectful, always.\n\nBe the model of what you expect from others.\n\nStart your day with positive affirmations, visualisations and positive focus.\n\nBe willing to do what is right, even when others don’t agree.\n\nFinally talk to yourself like someone you truly adore and admire...\n\nThere is so much more I would say to her....maybe when I get to 100, I will have my 100 life lessons. Remember life is a compilation of lessons and stories - embrace them.\n\nI want to say thank you to the leadership community and tribe who read and watch my posts, articles and insights.\n\nI have been doing this now for 15 years (15 years since I launched LeadershipHQ) and 30 years in the leadership, people and culture space. I could not do this without my daughter, team and you all.\n\nWe have helped and inspired 1000's of organisations, workplaces, leaders and people - and we have seen, experienced and navigated the adversities, joys and incredible impacts of being a leader, founder, parent, CEO, team and business like many of you.\n\nI want to say a wholehearted thank you for your support, courage and kindness as we do this for YOU.\n\nAll I want and ask if you are reading this to to live and lead a life of courage and kindness.\n\nSince I was little I loved to write and teach. Funnily enough I wanted to be a teacher and my teachers told me I was too smart to be a teacher. I wish I didn't listen to them. Maybe in hindsight it is good I didn't as I have come full circle.\n\nI would love you all to call into your inner child and do those things you loved to do whether it is painting, dancing like no one is watching, writing those stories that inspire you, collecting rocks or jumping into that cold and blue water from a cliff.\n\nI wish you all an amazing 2023.\n\nThink about your words, intentions, motivational quotes and mantras for 2023?\n\nWhat is your favourite?
