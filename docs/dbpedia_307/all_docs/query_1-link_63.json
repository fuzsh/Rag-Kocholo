        "text": "Overview[]\n\nSolo Leveling is licensed and published on Webnovel.com. Readers will find the novel under the title Only I Level Up instead of Solo Leveling or I Alone Level Up. In spite of this, “Solo Leveling” perhaps the work’s most recognizable English name. This is because Solo Leveling first became known to English readers through that name as fan-supported unofficial translations. Though it is difficult to trace, the original novel appears to have received a revised translation on Webnovel.com (formerly Quidan) where the work is licensed for English publication. Readers will find at the bottom of the story’s plot description a notice that the publication is “AN OFFICIAL LICENSED TRANSLATION BY D&C MEDIA.” D&C Media is the Korean publication company that is releasing the Webtoon adaptation of the Webnovel work.\n\nThose reading the novel on Webnovel.com and its apps will notice users citing 25th_chestnut as a favorite translator of the series.[1] This along with another user uploaded translations of Solo Leveling/I Alone Level Up’s chapters, assumingly while Webnovel.com was still Quidan and had volunteer users translate the works and were rated by the site’s users on both the quality of their translations as well as how frequently they released translated chapters.\n\nPublication History[]\n\nSolo Leveling (now Only I Level Up) was originally a South Korean novel written by Chugong (or Chu-Gong) primarily from 2017-2018 first through Papyrus, then through KakaoPage. Its webtoon adaptation started in 2018 and is still ongoing as of 2020. D&C Media now has an officially translated release of the novel to English readers through Webnovel.com (formerly Quidan) despite the website originally containing the uploaded translation work of other users. Traces of this can still be seen today in user comments and in translator notes.\n\nList of Differences in Translation of the Novel[]"
