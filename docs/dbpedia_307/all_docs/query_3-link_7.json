        "text": "Robert Edmond Alter is remembered chiefly for two novels, paperback originals from the 1960s: \"Swamp Sister\" (1961) and \"Carny Kill\" (1966). He also wrote children's novels and sold stories to some of the top magazines of his day, including the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Argosy\". Alter died suddenly at the age of 40 (some sources state it was Cancer). Some of his later works were published for the first time many years after his death. He was survived by his wife, Maxine and his daughter Sand."
