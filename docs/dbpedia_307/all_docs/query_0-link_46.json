        "text": "It is saying that the brave do have fear but they do not let it immobilize them.\n\nWalking has a literal meaning there, to move forward using one's legs and feet.\n\nFear is personified.\n\nI do not understand the phrase \"courage is fear walking.\"\n\nI assume what the speaker means is, \"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it\" or \"Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the willingness to act in spite of my fear\" or \"Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear\" or any of the other variations that you can find all over the internet attributed (probably incorrectly) to all kinds of historical figures.\n\n\"Courage is fear walking\" is a very strange way to express this. If I were you, I would not try to use fear in this way."
