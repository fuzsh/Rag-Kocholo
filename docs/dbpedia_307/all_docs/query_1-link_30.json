        "text": "📌To Be An Excellent Public Speaker You Need To Know These 3 Things. Public Speaking is the art of Communicating. But I’ll say Effectively Communicating is Key. Trying this 3 Things Will Make You Stand Out. ✅Confidence/Godfidence: Imagine Addressing your Audience and SHYNESS is written all over your face. I tell You, it’ll be difficult for them to believe what your saying. PS: Do not Forget to maintain Eye contact. It’s Proof you know what you’re saying and they’ll trust you. ✅Having A Mastery Of The Subject Matter. How Do I increase the Volume Of This?😃 How do you want to convey what You Do not Know? Forexample; Saying that “A dog is a reptile” or “Africa is a Country” Will make you sound like a clown. Hope You Get the Point. So Lets leave it at that. ✅Know Your Audience. Knowing Your Audience will help you to easily understand how to relay your message be it to Entrepreneurs, Students, Farmers, Gen Zs etc. You will be cognisant of your Choice of words, language, terminology.With these, You Cant Go wrong in communicating Effectively. Hope You’ve Learnt Something New Today😀 Go and THRIVE. ————————————————————- Meeting me for the First time, I’m 🇨🇲Ayuk Anticilia, A Creative Mind having same roots as #samueleto’o & #FrancisNgannou.

Did you generate money from what you're doing? Stop wasting your life... I reply, this is my life and I'll keep going. My friends, here I'm telling you the truth because of nasty judgments: Alhamdulillah... - It brings me to get closer only the RIGHT PEOPLE - It brings me to open the Quran as I do not understand Arabic, plus I want to understand what I recite in my prayers - It forced me to learn about rezq Keep writing Keep making videos Keep sharing knowledge Only your \"struggles\" and \"knowledge\" will shape the new you. Always believe if not you, then who? Bismillah! #communications #personaldevelopment #growth #personalbranding\n\nDo you have no confidence in using your English to grow your business internationally? Habeeb got a message on WhatsApp; it was from one of his clients from another country. Habeeb got everything ready for this client who was coming, and he talked to himself about how he would talk in English with his client. His client came, but while they were talking, his client couldn't understand most of Habeeb's words. Habeeb had to repeat most of his words two to three times before his client could understand him. Every time Habeeb was told to repeat his words, he got uncomfortable because he wasn't sure if it was because of his grammar errors or the way he said some words. At one point, he was afraid to say a word in English because he was making a lot of grammar errors, and it was hard for both of them to continue talking. If you are a Middle Eastern business owner and you are always afraid to talk with your international clients and partners because: ~ You always make grammar errors. ~ They always find it hard to understand your words in English. ~ You don't like the way you always say English words during meetings and events.

The first person is God himself, and the second is YOU.\" That's the response I gave to a friend's question, which made me feel like I had to act as someone's judge… over a week ago. And that's one thing I try to avoid by all means. 👉 I'm not a SAN😃 👉 I'm not your judge (\"Se I don judge myself finish?\" 😃) My Nigerian friends, If you're sure of your English prowess, go to the comment section translate into Queen's English ☝️😂 Now, while my response may sound like a diplomatic reply to you, you're indeed your JUDGE. That's why I believe these are profoundly correct: ¶ \"Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right,\" Henry Ford once said. ¶ If you see yourself as a weakling, people will see you and treat you as such. ¶ If you think you can achieve growth, progress, and success, you're right (You can add to the list.) PS: What are you telling yourself this new week THAT YOU Can do? PSS: I'll sharing an SEO-based carousel tomorrow. #contentwriter #Seocontentwriter\n\nDid you know that one of the major features of the English language is that it is arbitrary, or unreliable.🙄 The pronunciation pattern for one word does not necessarily work for the other word, even though they may have the same spelling pattern. That is to say, the /a/ sound in 'swap' is not the same as 'map'. Kindly note that the British pronunciation pattern is the standard for us as Nigerians.
