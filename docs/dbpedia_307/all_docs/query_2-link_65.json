        "text": "Profiles in Courage was written by John F. Kennedy when the iconic U.S. President was still a senator. The Pulitzer Prize-winning volume of short biographies tells of eight United States Senators who shown great courage under enormous pressure from their parties and their constituents. Among Kennedy’s featured senators were: John Quincy Adams, Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, Sam Houston, Edmund G. Ross, Lucius Lamar, George Norris, and Robert A. Taft. While these Senators suffered severe criticism and losses in popularity because of their actions, their stories are used to illustrate the principles and virtues that Kennedy believed were required of Americans in a century of progress. Profiles in Courage hit the bestsellers list three times: when JFK was an up-and-coming Senator in the late 1950s; after he was elected President in 1960-61; and following his assassination in 1963-64. The book led to the creation of the “Profiles in Courage” award, an annual award made to recognize displays of moral and political courage similar to those that Kennedy profiled.\n\nIn 2006, Harper published a special 50th anniversary edition of Profiles in Courage, which includes vintage photographs, an extensive JFK biography as well as some of his correspondence about the project, reviews of the book, a letter from Ernest Hemingway, and two speeches from recipients of the Profiles in Courage Award."
