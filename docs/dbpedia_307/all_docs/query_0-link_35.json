        "text": "Thanks for the Saturday entries for THE SCOURGE! The winner is: LANYA!\n\nAlso, I know I missed Sunday’s post. That’s how life goes sometimes. Now, for LINES OF COURAGE!\n\nI’ll be talking a lot about this book over the next few months.\n\nLINES OF COURAGE will be released on March 1, 2022. It tells the story of World War One from the perspectives of five kids from five countries over the five years of the war.\n\nI think World War One is fascinating, but it is a far lesser-known war than the Second World War.\n\nA couple of facts I think are really interesting include this:\n\nThis is called a camouflage ship. Normally if you think of a camouflage ship, you’d think of one that fades into the background so it’s hard to see. This is the very opposite. All it needs are blinking lights to say ARE YOU NOTICING ME?\n\nBut the strange patterns and shapes confused the enemy torpedo operators, who weren’t entirely sure where to aim. These camouflage ships may have saved the lives of thousands of soldiers in the British Navy.\n\nAlso, World War 1 produced the single largest battle in world history, in Verdun, France. The battle lasted almost a full year and was so destructive that after the war, the area was declared a Red Zone, a place not safe for humans. We have been cleaning it up over the last hundred years but the area still is a Red Zone. At our current rate of clean-up, the estimation is that the Red Zone will not be entirely safe for another 300 years!\n\nNow, to enter to win an ARC of this book, down in comments, can you leave me a favorite fact you know about World War One?\n\nTo preorder a copy (and I would love it if you did preorder!), links are here:\n\nThe King’s English (Autographed Copies)\n\nBookshop.org\n\nBarnes & Noble"
