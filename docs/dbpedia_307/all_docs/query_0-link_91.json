        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nDiscover Your Inner Courage\n\n\"Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, 'I will try again tomorrow.'\" --Mary Anne Rademacher\n\n#1 New Release in Humanist Philosophy\n\nWritten initially as part of a longer poem and featured in a gallery show in 1985, these words by Mary Anne Rademacher defining courage have traveled the globe.\n\nDefining courage in a beloved quote. The quote has been featured in ceremonies of all sorts and included in sports and network news broadcasts. Oprah has included it in her magazine and journalists include it in \"top ten\" lists across many disciplines and categories. And, it is among the most beloved quotes on cards, posters, journals, and gift books.\n\nBravery comes in many forms. Rademacher insists in her book that we overlook opportunities for growth and personal celebration by shrugging off courageous acts of perseverance with, \"I just did what I felt I had to do.\" Courage shows itself in many ways from having the courage to heal, to change habits, to learn and begin anew, or even to speak up for yourself.\n\nDefining courage with daily inspirations. This daily companion for women, men, or anyone who wants to change for good, and live a bolder, more courageous life may be the perfect addition to the start of your day or the key to letting go and ending your day right. Featuring an introduction from courage specialist, Candace Doby, Courage Doesn't Always Roar begins as an invitation to recognize all of the ways courage, and the associated risk, show up on ordinary days.\n\nInside you'll find:\n\nKeys to finding and defining courage in your everyday life\n\n180 entries covering all aspects of courage, like: resilience, thresholds, choices, grace, and more\n\nMental health-friendly inspirations meant to shape the way you think about courage\n\nIf you liked Courage is Calling, Inward, or Designing the Mind, you'll love Courage Doesn't Always Roar.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Finally, the business book we all need has been written by Mary Anne Radmacher. Her insight, wisdom and ability to get leaders to look within and reflect is invaluable. Courage Doesn't Always Roar is another tool to share with my team and fellow CEOs as we navigate leadership and authenticity together. Her words create a common language and inspire thought leadership. I have shared Em's writings near and far and often use them when it is my turn to facilitate my Monday morning CEO call. On a personal level, I start every day with a reflection of Em's words that I keep close at hand. I find continuous reinforcement of her words and mantras that enrich and guide me. It is like visiting with a friend again and again and again when I read her pages. Em's writing style creates the ability for the reader to open her work to any page and soak it in immediately.\"\n\n--Christopher K. M. Leach, CEO\n\n\" 'Courage doesn't always roar...' is one of Mary Anne Em Radmacher's most recognized aphorisms. Courage Doesn't Always Roar: Sometimes it Does is an invitation to explore how courage shows up in our everyday lives. It is a perfect daily inspiration book with each concept numbered and most fitting on a single page. Easy to pick up and read first thing each morning or in the 'found moments' of a busy day. The writing offers ideas that involve courage, broaden our understanding of ourselves and others, and create the potential for a more satisfying life. Each writing ends with a thought-provoking question to ponder in our days and 'enCOURAGE' us. A favorite of mine: 'Of what might you dare to dream today?' My answer 'Even more now that I have read this book!' \"\n\n--Caren Albers, author of Happiness Junkie and Married to a Vegan (memoirs) and Homecoming: Belonging and Knowing (poems & essays)\n\n\"Learning from Mary Anne is the gift that keeps on giving. Like many people, my first exposure to Mary Anne was her famous quotation 'Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, I will try again tomorrow.' Mary Anne calls this a poem. I call it wisdom. Now, she has written this book about courage, the Preface of which says 'Courage deserves a wider brushstroke of understanding.' Not only am I still learning what this simple poem means, but in this book, Mary Anne continues to teach us all what else it means to be courageous. Over the years, I have collected Mary Anne's artwork and posters about courage, as well as given them as gifts to others. Now, I will give this book of Mary Anne's courageous wisdom to others as well.\"\n\n--Arthur Bushkin, chairman of the Kindness Cloud Foundation\n\n\"There are those humans among us who see deeply into life, with all its magic, uncertainty, pain and bliss. These are the seers, bound to feel things at a deeper level and with more insight, and finding and illuminating patterns for the rest of us. Mary Anne Em Radmacher is such a seer, using words and images and color to help all of us see more deeply, feel more strongly, and understand more fully our own responsibilities to be courageous, to own and explore our feelings but not let them trap us. Read this book for a master class in being fully and unapologetically human.\"\n\n--Patti Digh, author of Life is a Verb and Geography of Loss\n\n\"Reassuring. Engaging. Uplifting. Mary Anne has done it again! This book delightfully captures the essence of her informed wisdom, unique writing style, and quirky humor. Beyond the useful ideas that reliably address some of life's many conundrums, each chapter concludes with a question that invites reflection, direction, and action. Like courage itself, this book sometimes whispers...and at other times it roars. Get ready to listen and respond!\"\n\n--Paul Wesselmann, the Ripples Guy (writer, speaker, adventurer)\n\n\"Wise. Warm. Infused with strength easily inhaled. Once again the creative spirit of Mary Anne Radmacher is a gift to all who seek courage for both the hard things and the everyday. May readers find what they need in Courage Doesn't Always Roar, a wisdom book carrying words to help each of us \"try again tomorrow.\"\n\n--Jane Kirkpatrick, NYTimes bestselling author of The Healing of Natalie Curtis\n\n\"[This book] came to me at a perfect time. I've been feeling the universe nudge me towards a bigger vision in my professional life, and this was exactly what i needed to help give me a little more courage to consider taking the next step... Mary Anne's expansion of her famous poem on courage is an excellent blueprint for navigating change with bravery and success. Step by step, this will lead you to find your life's greatest potential. Her wisdom, along with advice from some of her greatest influences, creates a guide that normalizes the challenges of practicing courage, gives permission to make mistakes and, most importantly, teaches you how to never give up on becoming your best self. This is the book that you will read, and share with others, again and again.\"\n\n--Grady Brown, sports coach in Little Rock, AR\n\n\"Mary Anne's Courage Doesn't Always Roar is both career-changing and life-altering. It helps you have a deeper understating of courage--it isn't just the loudest, biggest, or the first. Courage whispers and roars. It moves fast and knows when to slow down and be methodical. It pushes forward and knows when to turn back. Courage doesn't always roar... but it is indeed intentional. Mary Anne's daily inspirations will have you living, or leading, a more intentionally courageous life.\"\n\n--Robbie Hanson, operations executive and culture consultant, Portland, OR\n\n\"Courage Doesn't Always Roar is not a book to be read from front to back and certainly not in one sitting. Each essay asks us to reflect, to question the way we handle and incorporate life's twists and turns. Surprisingly, many of these essays can be applied to business--decision-making, finding clarity, handling obstacles, evaluating risk. Radmacher has a genius for honing in on the deceptively simple things that lead to consequential results. She clears away the overcomplications and disorder of daily life and gently nudges us to examine what we do and why we do it. This collection will help you to see differently, to examine alternatives, and hopefully lead you to raise new questions that challenge the way you courageously navigate this world.\"\n\n--Barbara Grassey, author and small business marketing strategist\n\n\"Courage, of course, comes from the French word meaning 'heart'--and this little book, which is titled from and expounds upon the author's well-known quotation that courage can simply be the resolve to try again tomorrow--is a wonderful compendium of ideas for how exactly to do that. As its subtitle suggests, author Mary Anne Radmacher takes a wide view of what courage can be and why this quality is so important to cultivate now. Set up to provide daily morsels for inspiration, each of the book's 189 short essays ends with a reflection question to deepen your understanding of that day's focus. Like all of the author's books, Courage Doesn't Always Roar is a work of heart--a thoughtful guide that will not only deepen your sense of the possibilities for demonstrating courage in your life, but also deepen your experience of life itself.\"\n\n--Maggie Oman Shannon, author of Prayers for Healing, Crafting Calm, and Have Hope"
