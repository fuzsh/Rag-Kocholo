        "text": "Read an entire Book to increase a given Stat permanently. Each book can have between two and five chapters. Only one chapter can be read at a time, unless you have already read \"Hyperspeed Reading.\" That book will allow you to read two chapters at a time. Reading will pass the time from afternoon to evening, or evening to the next day.\n\nThe description of 100 Ghost Stories is misleading, you don't gain courage like you read from the Man series, rather it doubles the effect of the courage increase when you work at the hospital.\n\nThe Book List below is in order of when they first become available. The Books that require a Strength Rank, and the Summer Festival Book, must be obtained on that date and only on that date!\n\nThe three Strength event-related books are absolutely miss-able if you are on the Basketball team, so pay close attention. If you are on the Soccer team, don't worry-- you'll be fine. Make sure to save the day before each book will become available. You may have to select the appropriate response to obtain the book during an outing.\n\nThese last two books are not quite as restrictive as the previous three, but you still need to pay attention to get them."
