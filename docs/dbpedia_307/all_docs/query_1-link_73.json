They turned\n\ntheir prows to the sea, secured the ships’ anchors,\n\nby the grip of their flukes, and the curved boats\n\nlined the beach. The youthful band leapt eagerly\n\nto the Hesperian shore: some sought the means of fire\n\ncontained in veins of flint, some raided the woods\n\nthe dense coverts of game, pointing out streams they found.\n\nBut pious Aeneas sought the summits, where Apollo\n\nrules on high, and the vast cavern nearby, the secret place\n\nof the terrifying Sibyl, in whom the Delian prophet\n\ninspires greatness of mind and spirit, and reveals the future.\n\nSoon they entered the grove of Diana, and the golden house.\n\nDaedalus, so the story goes, fleeing from Minos’s kingdom,\n\ndared to trust himself to the air on swift wings,\n\nand, gliding on unknown paths to the frozen North,\n\nhovered lightly at last above the Chalcidian hill.\n\nFirst returning to earth here, he dedicated his oar-like wings\n\nto you Phoebus, and built a gigantic temple.\n\nOn the doors the Death of Androgeos: then the Athenians,\n\nCrecrops’s descendants, commanded, sadly, to pay annual tribute\n\nof seven of their sons: there the urn stands with the lots drawn.\n\nFacing it, rising from the sea, the Cretan land is depicted:\n\nand here the bull’s savage passion, Pasiphae’s\n\nsecret union, and the Minotaur, hybrid offspring,\n\nthat mixture of species, proof of unnatural relations:\n\nthe artwork here is that palace, and its inextricable maze:\n\nand yet Daedalus himself, pitying the noble princess\n\nAriadne’s love, unravelled the deceptive tangle of corridors,\n\nguiding Theseus’s blind footsteps with the clue of thread.\n\nYou’d have shared largely in such a work, Icarus, if grief\n\nhad allowed, he’d twice attempted to fashion your fate\n\nin gold, twice your father’s hands fell. Eyes would have read\n\nthe whole continuously, if Achetes had not arrived\n\nfrom his errand, with Deiophobe, Glaucus’s daughter,\n\nthe priestess of Phoebus and Diana, who spoke to the leader:\n\n‘This moment doesn’t require your sightseeing: it would\n\nbe better to sacrifice seven bullocks from a virgin herd,\n\nand as many carefully chosen two-year old sheep.’\n\nHaving spoken to Aeneas in this way (without delay they sacrificed\n\nas ordered) the priestess called the Trojans to her high shrine.\n\nThe vast flank of the Euboean cliff is pitted with caves,\n\nfrom which a hundred wide tunnels, a hundred mouths lead,\n\nfrom which as many voices rush: the Sibyl’s replies.\n\nThey had come to the threshold, when the virgin cried out:\n\n‘It is time to question the Oracle, behold, the god, the god!’\n\nAs she so spoke in front of the doors, suddenly neither her face\n\nnor colour were the same, nor did her hair remain bound,\n\nbut her chest heaved, her heart swelled with wild frenzy,\n\nshe seemed taller, and sounded not-human, for now\n\nthe power of the god is closer. ‘Are you slow with your\n\nvows and prayers, Aeneas of Troy, are you slow?’\n\nshe cried. ‘The great lips of the House of Inspiration\n\nwill not open without.’ And so saying she fell silent.\n\nAn icy shudder ran to the Trojans’ very spines,\n\nand their leader poured out heartfelt prayers:\n\nBkVI:56-97 The Sibyl’s Prophecy\n\n‘Phoebus, you who always pitied Troy’s intense suffering,\n\nwho guided the hand of Paris, and the Dardan arrow,\n\nagainst Achilles’s body, with you as leader I entered\n\nall those seas, encircling vast lands, and penetrated\n\nthe remote Massilian tribes and the fields edged by Syrtes:\n\nnow at last we have the coast of elusive Italy in our grasp:\n\nTroy’s ill fortune only followed us as far as here.\n\nYou too with justice can spare the Trojan race, and all you gods\n\nand goddesses to whom the great glory of Ilium and Dardania\n\nwas an offence. O most sacred of prophetesses,\n\nyou who see the future, (I ask for no lands not owed me\n\nby my destiny) grant that we Trojans may settle Latium,\n\nwith the exiled gods and storm-tossed powers of Troy.\n\nThen I’ll dedicate a temple of solid marble to Phoebus\n\nand Diana Trivia, and sacred days in Phoebus’s name.\n\nA noble inner shrine waits for you too in our kingdom.\n\nThere, gracious one, I will place your oracles, and mystic\n\nutterances spoken to my people, and consecrate picked men.\n\nOnly do not write your verses on the leaves, lest they fly,\n\ndisordered playthings of the rushing winds: chant them\n\nfrom your own mouth.’ He put an end to his mouth’s speaking.\n\nBut the wild prophetess raged in her cavern, not yet\n\nsubmitting to Phoebus, as if she might shake the great god\n\nfrom her spirit: yet he exhausted her raving mouth\n\nall the more, taming her wild heart, shaping her by constraint.\n\nAnd now the shrine’s hundred mighty lips have opened\n\nof themselves, and carry the seer’s answer through the air:\n\n‘Oh, you who are done with all the perils of the sea,\n\n(yet greater await you on land) the Trojans will come\n\nto the realm of Lavinium (put that care from your heart):\n\nbut will not enjoy their coming. War, fierce war,\n\nI see: and the Tiber foaming with much blood.\n\nYou will not lack a Simois, a Xanthus, a Greek camp:\n\neven now another Achilles is born in Latium,\n\nhe too the son of a goddess: nor will Juno, the Trojans’ bane,\n\nbe ever far away, while you, humbled and destitute,\n\nwhat races and cities of Italy will you not beg in!\n\nOnce again a foreign bride is the cause of all\n\nthese Trojan ills, once more an alien marriage.\n\nDo not give way to misfortunes, meet them more bravely,\n\nas your destiny allows. The path of safety will open up\n\nfor you from where you least imagine it, a Greek city.’\n\nBkVI:98-155 Aeneas Asks Entry to Hades\n\nWith such words, the Sibyl of Cumae chants fearful enigmas,\n\nfrom her shrine, echoing from the cave,\n\ntangling truths and mysteries: as she raves, Apollo\n\nthrashes the reins, and twists the spur under her breast.\n\nWhen the frenzy quietens, and the mad mouth hushes,\n\nAeneas, the Hero, begins: ‘O Virgin, no new, unexpected\n\nkind of suffering appears: I’ve foreseen them all\n\nand travelled them before, in my own spirit.\n\nOne thing I ask: for they say the gate of the King of Darkness\n\nis here, and the shadowy marsh, Acheron’s overflow:\n\nlet me have sight of my dear father, his face: show me the way,\n\nopen wide the sacred doors. I saved him, brought him\n\nout from the thick of the enemy, through the flames,\n\non these shoulders, with a thousand spears behind me:\n\ncompanion on my journey, he endured with me\n\nall the seas, all the threats of sky and ocean, weak,\n\nbeyond his power, and his allotted span of old age.\n\nHe ordered me, with prayers, to seek you out, humbly,\n\nand approach your threshold: I ask you, kindly one,\n\npity both father and son: since you are all power, not for\n\nnothing has Hecate set you to rule the groves of Avernus.\n\nIf Orpheus could summon the shade of his wife,\n\nrelying on his Thracian lyre, its melodious strings:\n\nif Pollux, crossing that way, and returning, so often,\n\ncould redeem his brother by dying in turn – and great Theseus,\n\nwhat of him, or Hercules? – well, my race too is Jupiter’s on high.’\n\nWith these words he prayed, and grasped the altar,\n\nas the priestess began to speak: ‘Trojan son of Anchises,\n\nsprung from the blood of the gods, the path to hell is easy:\n\nblack Dis’s door is open night and day:\n\nbut to retrace your steps, and go out to the air above,\n\nthat is work, that is the task. Some sons of the gods have done it,\n\nwhom favouring Jupiter loved, or whom burning virtue\n\nlifted to heaven. Woods cover all the middle part,\n\nand Cocytus is round it, sliding in dark coils.\n\nBut if such desire is in your mind, such a longing\n\nto sail the Stygian lake twice, and twice see Tartarus,\n\nand if it delights you to indulge in insane effort,\n\nlisten to what you must first undertake. Hidden in a dark tree\n\nis a golden bough, golden in leaves and pliant stem,\n\nsacred to Persephone, the underworld’s Juno, all the groves\n\nshroud it, and shadows enclose the secret valleys.\n\nBut only one who’s taken a gold-leaved fruit from the tree\n\nis allowed to enter earth’s hidden places.\n\nThis lovely Proserpine has commanded to be brought to her\n\nas a gift: a second fruit of gold never fails to appear\n\nwhen the first one’s picked, the twig’s leafed with the same metal.\n\nSo look for it up high, and when you’ve found it with your eyes,\n\ntake it, of right, in your hand: since, if the Fates have chosen you,\n\nit will come away easily, freely of itself: otherwise you\n\nwon’t conquer it by any force, or cut it with the sharpest steel.\n\nAnd the inanimate body of your friend lies there\n\n(Ah! You do not know) and taints your whole fleet with death,\n\nwhile you seek advice and hang about our threshold.\n\nCarry him first to his place and bury him in the tomb.\n\nLead black cattle there: let those be your first offerings of atonement.\n\nOnly then can you look on the Stygian groves, and the realms\n\nforbidden to the living.’ She spoke and with closed lips fell silent.\n\nBkVI:156-182 The Finding of Misenus’s Body\n\nLeaving the cave, Aeneas walked away,\n\nwith sad face and downcast eyes, turning their dark fate\n\nover in his mind. Loyal Achates walked at his side\n\nand fashioned his steps with similar concern.\n\nThey engaged in intricate discussion between them,\n\nas to who the dead friend, the body to be interred, was,\n\nwhom the priestess spoke of. And as they passed along\n\nthey saw Misenus, ruined by shameful death, on the dry sand,\n\nMisenus, son of Aeolus, than whom none was more outstanding\n\nin rousing men with the war-trumpet, kindling conflict with music.\n\nHe was great Hector’s friend: with Hector\n\nhe went to battle, distinguished by his spear and trumpet.\n\nWhen victorious Achilles despoiled Hector of life,\n\nthis most courageous hero joined the company\n\nof Trojan Aeneas, serving no lesser a man. But when,\n\nby chance, he foolishly made the ocean sound\n\nto a hollow conch-shell, and called gods to compete\n\nin playing, if the tale can be believed, Triton overheard him\n\nand drowned him in the foaming waves among the rocks.\n\nSo, with pious Aeneas to the fore, they all mourned\n\nround the body with loud clamour. Then, without delay, weeping,\n\nthey hurried to carry out the Sibyl’s orders, and laboured to pile\n\ntree-trunks as a funeral pyre, raising it to the heavens.\n\nThey enter the ancient wood, the deep coverts of wild creatures:\n\nthe pine-trees fell, the oaks rang to the blows of the axe,\n\nash trunks and fissile oak were split with wedges,\n\nand they rolled large rowan trees down from the hills.\n\nBkVI:183-235 The Funeral Pyre\n\nAeneas was no less active in such efforts, encouraging\n\nhis companions, and employing similar tools.\n\nAnd he turned things over in his own saddened mind,\n\ngazing at the immense forest, and by chance prayed so:\n\n‘If only that golden bough would show itself to us\n\nnow, on some such tree, among the woods! For the prophetess\n\nspoke truly of you Misenus, alas, only too truly.’\n\nHe had barely spoken when by chance a pair of doves\n\ncame flying down from the sky, beneath his very eyes,\n\nand settled on the green grass. Then the great hero knew\n\nthey were his mother’s birds, and prayed in his joy:\n\n‘O be my guides, if there is some way, and steer a course\n\nthrough the air, to that grove where the rich branch\n\ncasts its shadow on fertile soil. And you mother, O goddess,\n\ndon’t fail me in time of doubt.’ So saying he halted his footsteps,\n\nobserving what signs the doves might give, and which direction\n\nthey might take. As they fed they went forward in flight\n\njust as far as, following, his eyes could keep them in sight.\n\nThen, when they reached the foul jaws of stinking Avernus,\n\nthey quickly rose and, gliding through the clear air,\n\nperched on the longed-for dual-natured tree, from which\n\nthe alien gleam of gold shone out, among the branches.\n\nJust as mistletoe, that does not form a tree of its own,\n\ngrows in the woods in the cold of winter, with a foreign leaf,\n\nand surrounds a smooth trunk with yellow berries:\n\nsuch was the vision of this leafy gold in the dark\n\noak-tree, so the foil tinkled in the light breeze.\n\nAeneas immediately plucked it, eagerly breaking the tough\n\nbough, and carried it to the cave of the Sibylline prophetess.\n\nMeanwhile, on the shore, the Trojans were weeping bitterly\n\nfor Misenus and paying their last respects to his senseless ashes.\n\nFirst they raised a huge pyre, heavy with cut oak and pine,\n\nweaving the sides with dark foliage, set funereal cypress in front,\n\nand decorated it above with shining weapons.\n\nSome heated water, making the cauldrons boil on the flames,\n\nand washed and anointed the chill corpse. They made lament.\n\nThen, having wept, they placed his limbs on the couch,\n\nand threw purple robes over them, his usual dress.\n\nSome raised the great bier, a sad duty,\n\nand, with averted faces, set a torch below,\n\nin ancestral fashion. Gifts were heaped on the flames,\n\nof incense, foodstuffs, bowls brimming with olive-oil.\n\nWhen the ashes collapsed, and the blaze died, they washed\n\nthe remains of the parched bones in wine, and Corynaeus,\n\ncollecting the fragments, closed them in a bronze urn.\n\nAlso he circled his comrades three times with pure water\n\nto purify them, sprinkling fine dew from a full olive branch,\n\nand spoke the words of parting. And virtuous Aeneas\n\nheaped up a great mound for his tomb, with the hero’s\n\nown weapons, his trumpet and oar, beneath a high mountain\n\nwhich is called Misenus now after him, and preserves\n\nhis ever-living name throughout the ages.\n\nBkVI:236-263 The Sacrifice to Hecate\n\nThis done, he quickly carried out the Sibyl’s orders.\n\nThere was a deep stony cave, huge and gaping wide,\n\nsheltered by a dark lake and shadowy woods,\n\nover which nothing could extend its wings in safe flight,\n\nsince such a breath flowed from those black jaws,\n\nand was carried to the over-arching sky, that the Greeks\n\ncalled it by the name Aornos, that is Avernus, or the Bird-less.\n\nHere the priestess first of all tethered four black heifers,\n\npoured wine over their foreheads, and placed\n\nthe topmost bristles that she plucked, growing\n\nbetween their horns, in the sacred fire, as a first offering,\n\ncalling aloud to Hecate, powerful in Heaven and Hell.\n\nOthers slit the victim’s throats and caught the warm blood\n\nin bowls. Aeneas himself sacrificed a black-fleeced lamb\n\nto Night, mother of the Furies, and Earth, her mighty sister,\n\nand a barren heifer to you, Persephone.\n\nThen he kindled the midnight altars for the Stygian King,\n\nand placed whole carcasses of bulls on the flames,\n\npouring rich oil over the blazing entrails.\n\nSee now, at the dawn light of the rising sun,\n\nthe ground bellowed under their feet, the wooded hills began\n\nto move, and, at the coming of the Goddess, dogs seemed to howl\n\nin the shadows. ‘Away, stand far away, O you profane ones,’\n\nthe priestess cried, ‘absent yourselves from all this grove:\n\nand you now, Aeneas, be on your way, and tear your sword\n\nfrom the sheathe: you need courage, and a firm mind, now.’\n\nSo saying, she plunged wildly into the open cave:\n\nhe, fearlessly, kept pace with his vanishing guide.\n\nBkVI:264-294 The Entrance to Hades\n\nYou gods, whose is the realm of spirits, and you, dumb shadows,\n\nand Chaos, Phlegethon, wide silent places of the night,\n\nlet me tell what I have heard: by your power, let me\n\nreveal things buried in the deep earth, and the darkness.\n\nOn they went, hidden in solitary night, through gloom,\n\nthrough Dis’s empty halls, and insubstantial kingdom,\n\nlike a path through a wood, in the faint light\n\nunder a wavering moon, when Jupiter has buried the sky\n\nin shadow, and black night has stolen the colour from things.\n\nRight before the entrance, in the very jaws of Orcus,\n\nGrief and vengeful Care have made their beds,\n\nand pallid Sickness lives there, and sad Old Age,\n\nand Fear, and persuasive Hunger, and vile Need,\n\nforms terrible to look on, and Death and Pain:\n\nthen Death’s brother Sleep, and Evil Pleasure of the mind,\n\nand, on the threshold opposite, death-dealing War,\n\nand the steel chambers of the Furies, and mad Discord,\n\nher snaky hair entwined with blood-wet ribbons.\n\nIn the centre a vast shadowy elm spreads its aged trunks\n\nand branches: the seat, they say, that false Dreams hold,\n\nthronging, clinging beneath every leaf.\n\nAnd many other monstrous shapes of varied creatures,\n\nare stabled by the doors, Centaurs and bi-formed Scylla,\n\nand hundred-armed Briareus, and the Lernean Hydra,\n\nhissing fiercely, and the Chimaera armed with flame,\n\nGorgons, and Harpies, and the triple bodied shade, Geryon.\n\nAt this, trembling suddenly with terror, Aeneas grasped\n\nhis sword, and set the naked blade against their approach:\n\nand, if his knowing companion had not warned him\n\nthat these were tenuous bodiless lives flitting about\n\nwith a hollow semblance of form, he would have rushed at them,\n\nand hacked at the shadows uselessly with his sword.\n\nBkVI:295-336 The Shores of Acheron\n\nFrom here there is a road that leads to the waters\n\nof Tartarean Acheron. Here thick with mud a whirlpool seethes\n\nin the vast depths, and spews all its sands into Cocytus.\n\nA grim ferryman watches over the rivers and streams,\n\nCharon, dreadful in his squalor, with a mass of unkempt\n\nwhite hair straggling from his chin: flames glow in his eyes,\n\na dirty garment hangs, knotted from his shoulders.\n\nHe poles the boat and trims the sails himself,\n\nand ferries the dead in his dark skiff,\n\nold now, but a god’s old age is fresh and green.\n\nHere all the crowd streams, hurrying to the shores,\n\nwomen and men, the lifeless bodies of noble heroes,\n\nboys and unmarried girls, sons laid on the pyre\n\nin front of their father’s eyes: as many as the leaves that fall\n\nin the woods at the first frost of autumn, as many as the birds\n\nthat flock to land from ocean deeps, when the cold of the year\n\ndrives them abroad and despatches them to sunnier countries.\n\nThey stood there, pleading to be first to make the crossing,\n\nstretching out their hands in longing for the far shore.\n\nBut the dismal boatman accepts now these, now those,\n\nbut driving others away, keeps them far from the sand.\n\nThen Aeneas, stirred and astonished at the tumult, said:\n\n‘O virgin, tell me, what does this crowding to the river mean?\n\nWhat do the souls want? And by what criterion do these leave\n\nthe bank, and those sweep off with the oars on the leaden stream?\n\nThe ancient priestess spoke briefly to him, so:\n\n‘Son of Anchises, true child of the gods, you see\n\nthe deep pools of Cocytus, and the Marsh of Styx,\n\nby whose name the gods fear to swear falsely.\n\nAll this crowd, you see, were destitute and unburied:\n\nthat ferryman is Charon: those the waves carry were buried:\n\nhe may not carry them from the fearful shore on the harsh waters\n\nbefore their bones are at rest in the earth. They roam\n\nfor a hundred years and flit around these shores: only then\n\nare they admitted, and revisit the pools they long for.’\n\nThe son of Anchises halted, and checked his footsteps,\n\nthinking deeply, and pitying their sad fate in his heart.\n\nHe saw Leucaspis and Orontes, captain of the Lycian fleet,\n\nthere, grieving and lacking honour in death, whom a Southerly\n\noverwhelmed, as they sailed together from Troy on the windswept\n\nwaters, engulfing both the ship and crew in the waves.\n\nBkVI:337-383 The Shade of Palinurus\n\nBehold, there came the helmsman, Palinurus,\n\nwho fell from the stern on the Libyan passage,\n\nflung into the midst of the waves, as he watched the stars.\n\nWhen Aeneas had recognised him with difficulty\n\nsorrowing among the deep shadows, he spoke first, saying:\n\n‘What god tore you from us, Palinurus, and drowned you\n\nmid-ocean? For in this one prophecy Apollo has misled me,\n\nhe whom I never found false before, he said that you would be safe\n\nat sea and reach Ausonia’s shores. Is this the truth of his promise?’\n\nBut he replied: ‘Phoebus’s tripod did not fail you, Aeneas,\n\nmy captain, nor did a god drown me in the deep.\n\nBy chance the helm was torn from me with violence,\n\nas I clung there, on duty as ordered, steering our course,\n\nand I dragged it headlong with me. I swear by the cruel sea\n\nthat I feared less for myself than for your ship,\n\nlest robbed of its gear, and cleared of its helmsman,\n\nit might founder among such surging waves.\n\nThe Southerly drove me violently through the vast seas\n\nfor three stormy nights: high on the crest of a wave,\n\nin the fourth dawn, I could just make out Italy.\n\nGradually I swam to shore: grasped now at safety,\n\nbut as I caught at the sharp tips of the rocks, weighed down\n\nby my water-soaked clothes, the savage people\n\nattacked me with knives, ignorantly thinking me a prize.\n\nNow the waves have me, and the winds roll me along the shore.\n\nUnconquered one, I beg you, by the sweet light and air of heaven,\n\nby your father, and your hopes in Iulus to come,\n\nsave me from this evil: either find Velia’s harbour again\n\n(for you can) and sprinkle earth on me, or if there is some way,\n\nif your divine mother shows you one (since you’d not attempt to sail\n\nsuch waters, and the Stygian marsh, without a god’s will, I think)\n\nthen give this wretch your hand and take me with you through the waves\n\nthat at least I might rest in some quiet place in death.’\n\nSo he spoke, and the priestess began to reply like this:\n\n‘Where does this dire longing of yours come from, O Palinurus?\n\nCan you see the Stygian waters, unburied, or the grim\n\nriver of the Furies, Cocytus, or come unasked to the shore?\n\nCease to hope that divine fate can be tempered by prayer.\n\nBut hold my words in your memory, as a comfort in your hardship:\n\nthe nearby peoples, from cities far and wide, will be moved\n\nby divine omens to worship your bones, and build a tomb,\n\nand send offerings to the tomb, and the place will have\n\nPalinurus as its everlasting name.’ His anxiety was quelled\n\nby her words, and, for a little while, grief was banished\n\nfrom his sad heart: he delighted in the land being so named.\n\nBkVI:384-416 Charon the Ferryman\n\nSo they pursued their former journey, and drew near the river.\n\nNow when the Boatman saw them from the Stygian wave\n\nwalking through the silent wood, and directing their footsteps\n\ntowards its bank, he attacked them verbally, first, and unprompted,\n\nrebuking them: ‘Whoever you are, who come armed to my river,\n\ntell me, from over there, why you’re here, and halt your steps.\n\nThis is a place of shadows, of Sleep and drowsy Night:\n\nI’m not allowed to carry living bodies in the Stygian boat.\n\nTruly it was no pleasure for me to take Hercules on his journey\n\nover the lake, nor Theseus and Pirithous, though they may\n\nhave been children of gods, unrivalled in strength.\n\nThe first came for Cerberus the watchdog of Tartarus,\n\nand dragged him away quivering from under the king’s throne:\n\nthe others were after snatching our Queen from Dis’s chamber.’\n\nTo this the prophetess of Amphrysian Apollo briefly answered:\n\n‘There’s no such trickery here (don’t be disturbed),\n\nour weapons offer no affront: your huge guard-dog\n\ncan terrify the bloodless shades with his eternal howling:\n\nchaste Proserpine can keep to her uncle’s threshold.\n\nAeneas the Trojan, renowned in piety and warfare,\n\ngoes down to the deepest shadows of Erebus, to his father.\n\nIf the idea of such affection does not move you, still you\n\nmust recognise this bough.’ (She showed the branch, hidden\n\nin her robes.) Then the anger in his swollen breast subsided.\n\nNo more was said. Marvelling at the revered offering,\n\nof fateful twigs, seen again after so long, he turned the stern\n\nof the dark skiff towards them and neared the bank.\n\nThen he turned off the other souls who sat on the long benches,\n\ncleared the gangways: and received mighty Aeneas\n\non board. The seamed skiff groaned with the weight\n\nand let in quantities of marsh-water through the chinks.\n\nAt last, the river crossed, he landed the prophetess and the hero\n\nsafe, on the unstable mud, among the blue-grey sedge.\n\nBkVI:417-439 Beyond the Acheron\n\n‘Torments of Hell’ - Carl Ludwig Beutler (Germany, 1638 - 1683), Yale University Art Gallery\n\nHuge Cerberus sets these regions echoing with his triple-throated\n\nhowling, crouching monstrously in a cave opposite.\n\nSeeing the snakes rearing round his neck, the prophetess\n\nthrew him a pellet, a soporific of honey and drugged wheat.\n\nOpening his three throats, in rabid hunger, he seized\n\nwhat she threw and, flexing his massive spine, sank to earth\n\nspreading his giant bulk over the whole cave-floor.\n\nWith the guard unconscious Aeneas won to the entrance,\n\nand quickly escaped the bank of the river of no return.\n\nImmediately a loud crying of voices was heard, the spirits\n\nof weeping infants, whom a dark day stole at the first\n\nthreshold of this sweet life, those chosen to be torn\n\nfrom the breast, and drowned in bitter death.\n\nNearby are those condemned to die on false charges.\n\nYet their place is not ordained without the allotted jury:\n\nMinos, the judge, shakes the urn: he convenes the voiceless court,\n\nand hears their lives and sins. Then the next place\n\nis held by those gloomy spirits who, innocent of crime,\n\ndied by their own hand, and, hating the light, threw away\n\ntheir lives. How willingly now they’d endure\n\npoverty and harsh suffering, in the air above!\n\nDivine Law prevents it, and the sad marsh and its hateful\n\nwaters binds them, and nine-fold Styx confines them.\n\nBkVI:440-476 The Shade of Dido\n\nNot far from there the Fields of Mourning are revealed,\n\nspread out on all sides: so they name them.\n\nThere, those whom harsh love devours with cruel pining\n\nare concealed in secret walkways, encircled by a myrtle grove:\n\neven in death their troubles do not leave them.\n\nHere Aeneas saw Phaedra, and Procris, and sad Eriphyle,\n\ndisplaying the wounds made by her cruel son,\n\nEvadne, and Pasiphae: with them walked Laodamia,\n\nand Caeneus, now a woman, once a young man,\n\nreturned by her fate to her own form again.\n\nAmong them Phoenician Dido wandered, in the great wood,\n\nher wound still fresh. As soon as the Trojan hero stood near her\n\nand knew her, shadowy among the shadows, like a man who sees,\n\nor thinks he sees, the new moon rising through a cloud, as its month\n\nbegins, he wept tears and spoke to her with tender affection:\n\n‘Dido, unhappy spirit, was the news, that came to me\n\nof your death, true then, taking your life with a blade?\n\nAlas, was I the cause of your dying? I swear by the stars,\n\nby the gods above, by whatever truth may be in the depths\n\nof the earth, I left your shores unwillingly, my queen.\n\nI was commanded by gods, who drove me by their decrees,\n\nthat now force me to go among the shades, through places\n\nthorny with neglect, and deepest night: nor did I think\n\nmy leaving there would ever bring such grief to you.\n\nHalt your footsteps and do not take yourself from my sight.\n\nWhat do you flee? This is the last speech with you that fate allows.’\n\nWith such words Aeneas would have calmed\n\nher fiery spirit and wild looks, and provoked her tears.\n\nShe turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground,\n\nno more altered in expression by the speech he had begun\n\nthan if hard flint stood there, or a cliff of Parian marble.\n\nAt the last she tore herself away, and, hostile to him,\n\nfled to the shadowy grove where Sychaeus, her husband\n\nin former times, responded to her suffering, and gave her\n\nlove for love. Aeneas, no less shaken by the injustice of fate,\n\nfollowed her, far off, with his tears, and pitied her as she went.\n\nBkVI:477-534 The Shade of Deiphobus\n\nFrom there he laboured on the way that was granted them.\n\nAnd soon they reached the most distant fields,\n\nthe remote places where those famous in war\n\ncrowd together. Here Tydeus met him, Parthenopaeus\n\nglorious in arms, and the pale form of Adrastus:\n\nhere were the Trojans, wept for deeply above, fallen in war,\n\nwhom, seeing them all in their long ranks, he groaned at,\n\nGlaucus, Medon and Thersilochus, the three sons of Antenor,\n\nPolyboetes, the priest of Ceres, and Idaeus\n\nstill with his chariot, and his weapons.\n\nThe spirits stand there in crowds to left and right.\n\nThey are not satisfied with seeing him only once:\n\nthey delight in lingering on, walking beside him,\n\nand learning the reason for his coming.\n\nBut the Greek princes and Agamemnon’s phalanxes,\n\ntrembled with great fear, when they saw the hero,\n\nand his gleaming weapons, among the shades:\n\nsome turned to run, as they once sought their ships: some raised\n\na faint cry, the noise they made belying their gaping mouths.\n\nAnd he saw Deiphobus there, Priam’s son, his whole body\n\nmutilated, his face brutally torn, his face and hands both, the ears\n\nripped from his ruined head, his nostrils sheared by an ugly wound.\n\nIndeed Aeneas barely recognised the quivering form, hiding its dire\n\npunishment, even as he called to him, unprompted, in familiar tones:\n\n‘Deiphobus, powerful in war, born of Teucer’s noble blood,\n\nwho chose to work such brutal punishment on you?\n\nWho was allowed to treat you so? Rumour has it\n\nthat on that final night, wearied by endless killing of Greeks,\n\nyou sank down on a pile of the slaughtered.\n\nThen I set up an empty tomb on the Rhoetean shore,\n\nand called on your spirit three times in a loud voice.\n\nYour name and weapons watch over the site: I could not\n\nsee you, friend, to set you, as I left, in your native soil.’\n\nTo this Priam’s son replied: ‘O my friend, you’ve neglected\n\nnothing: you’ve paid all that’s due to Deiophobus\n\nand a dead man’s spirit. My own destiny,\n\nand that Spartan woman’s deadly crime, drowned me\n\nin these sorrows: she left me these memorials.\n\nYou know how we passed that last night in illusory joy:\n\nand you must remember it only too well.\n\nWhen the fateful Horse came leaping the walls of Troy,\n\npregnant with the armed warriors it carried in its womb,\n\nshe led the Trojan women about, wailing in dance,\n\naping the Bacchic rites: she held a huge torch in their midst,\n\nsignalling to the Greeks from the heights of the citadel.\n\nI was then in our unlucky marriage-chamber, worn out with care,\n\nand heavy with sleep, a sweet deep slumber weighing on me\n\nas I lay there, the very semblance of peaceful death.\n\nMeanwhile that illustrious wife of mine removed every weapon\n\nfrom the house, even stealing my faithful sword from under my head:\n\nshe calls Menelaus into the house and throws open the doors,\n\nhoping I suppose it would prove a great gift for her lover,\n\nand in that way the infamy of her past sins might be erased.\n\nWhy drag out the tale? They burst into the room, and with them\n\nUlysses the Aeolid, their co-inciter to wickedness. Gods, so repay\n\nthe Greeks, if these lips I pray for vengeance with are virtuous.\n\nBut you, in turn, tell what fate has brought you here, living.\n\nDo you come here, driven by your wandering on the sea,\n\nor exhorted by the gods? If not, what misfortune torments you,\n\nthat you enter these sad sunless houses, this troubled place?’\n\nBkVI:535-627 The Sibyl Describes Tartarus\n\nWhile they spoke Aurora and her rosy chariot had passed\n\nthe zenith of her ethereal path, and they might perhaps\n\nhave spent all the time allowed in such talk, but the Sibyl,\n\nhis companion, warned him briefly saying:\n\n‘Night approaches, Aeneas: we waste the hours with weeping.\n\nThis is the place where the path splits itself in two:\n\nthere on the right is our road to Elysium, that runs beneath\n\nthe walls of mighty Dis: but the left works punishment\n\non the wicked, and sends them on to godless Tartarus.’\n\nDeiophobus replied: ‘Do not be angry, great priestess:\n\nI will leave: I will make up the numbers, and return to the darkness.\n\nGo now glory of our race: enjoy a better fate.’\n\nSo he spoke, and in speaking turned away.\n\nAeneas suddenly looked back, and, below the left hand cliff,\n\nhe saw wide battlements, surrounded by a triple wall,\n\nand encircled by a swift river of red-hot flames,\n\nthe Tartarean Phlegethon, churning with echoing rocks.\n\nA gate fronts it, vast, with pillars of solid steel,\n\nthat no human force, not the heavenly gods themselves,\n\ncan overturn by war: an iron tower rises into the air,\n\nand seated before it, Tisiphone, clothed in a blood-wet dress,\n\nkeeps guard of the doorway, sleeplessly, night and day.\n\nGroans came from there, and the cruel sound of the lash,\n\nthen the clank of iron, and dragging chains.\n\nAeneas halted, and stood rooted, terrified by the noise.\n\n‘What evil is practised here? O Virgin, tell me: by what torments\n\nare they oppressed? Why are there such sounds in the air?’\n\nThen the prophetess began to speak as follows: ‘Famous leader\n\nof the Trojans, it is forbidden for the pure to cross the evil threshold:\n\nbut when Hecate appointed me to the wood of Avernus,\n\nshe taught me the divine torments, and guided me through them all.\n\nCretan Rhadamanthus rules this harshest of kingdoms,\n\nand hears their guilt, extracts confessions, and punishes\n\nwhoever has deferred atonement for their sins too long\n\ntill death, delighting in useless concealment, in the world above.\n\nTisiphone the avenger, armed with her whip, leaps on the guilty immediately,\n\nlashes them, and threatening them with the fierce\n\nsnakes in her left hand, calls to her savage troop of sisters.\n\nThen at last the accursed doors open, screeching on jarring hinges.\n\nYou comprehend what guardian sits at the door, what shape watches\n\nthe threshold? Well still fiercer is the monstrous Hydra inside,\n\nwith her fifty black gaping jaws. There Tartarus itself\n\nfalls sheer, and stretches down into the darkness:\n\ntwice as far as we gaze upwards to heavenly Olympus.\n\nHere the Titanic race, the ancient sons of Earth,\n\nhurled down by the lightning-bolt, writhe in the depths.\n\nAnd here I saw the two sons of Aloeus, giant forms,\n\nwho tried to tear down the heavens with their hands,\n\nand topple Jupiter from his high kingdom.\n\nAnd I saw Salmoneus paying a savage penalty\n\nfor imitating Jove’s lightning, and the Olympian thunder.\n\nBrandishing a torch, and drawn by four horses\n\nhe rode in triumph among the Greeks, through Elis’s city,\n\nclaiming the gods’ honours as his own, a fool,\n\nwho mimicked the storm-clouds and the inimitable thunderbolt\n\nwith bronze cymbals and the sound of horses’ hoof-beats.\n\nBut the all-powerful father hurled his lighting from dense cloud,\n\nnot for him fiery torches, or pine-branches’ smoky light\n\nand drove him headlong with the mighty whirlwind.\n\nAnd Tityus was to be seen as well, the foster-child\n\nof Earth, our universal mother, whose body stretches\n\nover nine acres, and a great vulture with hooked beak\n\nfeeds on his indestructible liver, and his entrails ripe\n\nfor punishment, lodged deep inside the chest, groping\n\nfor his feast, no respite given to the ever-renewing tissue.\n\nShall I speak of the Lapiths, Ixion, Pirithous,\n\nover whom hangs a dark crag that seems to slip and fall?\n\nHigh couches for their feast gleam with golden frames,\n\nand a banquet of royal luxury is spread before their eyes:\n\nnearby the eldest Fury, crouching, prevents their fingers touching\n\nthe table: rising up, and brandishing her torch, with a voice of thunder.\n\nHere are those who hated their brothers, in life,\n\nor struck a parent, or contrived to defraud a client,\n\nor who crouched alone over the riches they’d made,\n\nwithout setting any aside for their kin (their crowd is largest),\n\nthose who were killed for adultery, or pursued civil war,\n\nnot fearing to break their pledges to their masters:\n\nshut in they see their punishment. Don’t ask to know\n\nthat punishment, or what kind of suffering drowns them.\n\nSome roll huge stones, or hang spread-eagled\n\non wheel-spokes: wretched Theseus sits still, and will sit\n\nfor eternity: Phlegyas, the most unfortunate, warns them all\n\nand bears witness in a loud voice among the shades:\n\n“Learn justice: be warned, and don’t despise the gods.”\n\nHere’s one who sold his country for gold, and set up\n\na despotic lord: this one made law and remade it for a price:\n\nhe entered his daughter’s bed and a forbidden marriage:\n\nall of them dared monstrous sin, and did what they dared.\n\nNot if I had a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths,\n\na voice of iron, could I tell all the forms of wickedness\n\nor spell out the names of every torment.’\n\nBkVI:628-678 The Fields of Elysium\n\nWhen she had spoken of this, the aged priestess of Apollo said:\n\n‘But come now, travel the road, and complete the task set for you:\n\nlet us hurry, I see the battlements that were forged\n\nin the Cyclopean fires, and the gates in the arch opposite us\n\nwhere we are told to set down the gifts as ordered.’\n\nShe spoke and keeping step they hastened along the dark path\n\ncrossing the space between and arriving near the doors.\n\nAeneas gained the entrance, sprinkled fresh water\n\nover his body, and set up the branch on the threshold before him.\n\nHaving at last achieved this, the goddess’s task fulfilled,\n\nthey came to the pleasant places, the delightful grassy turf\n\nof the Fortunate Groves, and the homes of the blessed.\n\nHere freer air and radiant light clothe the plain,\n\nand these have their own sun, and their own stars.\n\nSome exercise their bodies in a grassy gymnasium,\n\ncompete in sports and wrestle on the yellow sand:\n\nothers tread out the steps of a dance, and sing songs.\n\nThere Orpheus too, the long-robed priest of Thrace,\n\naccompanies their voices with the seven-note scale,\n\nplaying now with fingers, now with the ivory quill.\n\nHere are Teucer’s ancient people, loveliest of children,\n\ngreat-hearted heroes, born in happier years,\n\nIlus, Assaracus, and Dardanus founder of Troy.\n\nAeneas marvels from a distance at their idle chariots\n\nand their weapons: their spears fixed in the ground,\n\nand their horses scattered freely browsing over the plain:\n\nthe pleasure they took in chariots and armour while alive,\n\nthe care in tending shining horses, follows them below the earth.\n\nLook, he sees others on the grass to right and left, feasting,\n\nand singing a joyful paean in chorus, among the fragrant\n\ngroves of laurel, out of which the Eridanus’s broad river\n\nflows through the woodlands to the world above.\n\nHere is the company of those who suffered wounds fighting\n\nfor their country: and those who were pure priests, while they lived,\n\nand those who were faithful poets, singers worthy of Apollo,\n\nand those who improved life, with discoveries in Art or Science,\n\nand those who by merit caused others to remember them:\n\nthe brows of all these were bound with white headbands.\n\nAs they crowded round, the Sibyl addressed them,\n\nMusaeus above all: since he holds the centre of the vast crowd,\n\nall looking up to him, his tall shoulders towering above:\n\n‘Blessed spirits, and you, greatest of Poets,\n\nsay what region or place contains Anchises. We have\n\ncome here, crossing the great rivers of Erebus, for him.’\n\nAnd the hero replied to her briefly in these words:\n\n‘None of us have a fixed abode: we live in the shadowy woods,\n\nand make couches of river-banks, and inhabit fresh-water meadows.\n\nBut climb this ridge, if your hearts-wish so inclines,\n\nand I will soon set you on an easy path.’\n\nHe spoke and went on before them, and showed them\n\nthe bright plains below: then they left the mountain heights.\n\nBkVI:679-702 The Meeting with Anchises\n\nBut deep in a green valley his father Anchises\n\nwas surveying the spirits enclosed there, destined\n\nfor the light above, thinking carefully, and was reviewing\n\nas it chanced the numbers of his own folk, his dear grandsons,\n\nand their fate and fortunes as men, and their ways and works.\n\nAnd when he saw Aeneas heading towards him over the grass\n\nhe stretched out both his hands eagerly, his face\n\nstreaming with tears, and a cry issued from his lips:\n\n‘Have you come at last, and has the loyalty your father expected\n\nconquered the harsh road? Is it granted me to see your face,\n\nmy son, and hear and speak in familiar tones?\n\nI calculated it in my mind, and thought it would be so,\n\ncounting off the hours, nor has my trouble failed me.\n\nFrom travel over what lands and seas, do I receive you!\n\nWhat dangers have hurled you about, my son!\n\nHow I feared the realms of Libya might harm you!’\n\nHe answered: ‘Father, your image, yours, appearing to me\n\nso often, drove me to reach this threshold:\n\nMy ships ride the Etruscan waves. Father, let me clasp\n\nyour hand, let me, and do not draw away from my embrace.’\n\nSo speaking, his face was also drowned in a flood of tears.\n\nThree times he tries to throw his arms round his father’s neck,\n\nthree times, clasped in vain, that semblance slips though his hands,\n\nlike the light breeze, most of all like a winged dream.\n\nBkVI:703-723 The Souls Due for Re-birth\n\nAnd now Aeneas saw a secluded grove\n\nin a receding valley, with rustling woodland thickets,\n\nand the river of Lethe gliding past those peaceful places.\n\nInnumerable tribes and peoples hovered round it:\n\njust as, in the meadows, on a cloudless summer’s day,\n\nthe bees settle on the multifarious flowers, and stream\n\nround the bright lilies, and all the fields hum with their buzzing.\n\nAeneas was thrilled by the sudden sight, and, in ignorance,\n\nasked the cause: what the river is in the distance,\n\nwho the men are crowding the banks in such numbers.\n\nThen his father Anchises answered: ‘They are spirits,\n\nowed a second body by destiny, and they drink\n\nthe happy waters, and a last forgetting, at Lethe’s stream.\n\nIndeed, for a long time I’ve wished to tell you of them,\n\nand show you them face to face, to enumerate my children’s\n\ndescendants, so you might joy with me more at finding Italy.’\n\n‘O father, is it to be thought that any spirits go from here\n\nto the sky above, returning again to dull matter?’\n\n‘Indeed I’ll tell you, son, not keep you in doubt,’\n\nAnchises answered, and revealed each thing in order.\n\nBkVI:724-751 The Transmigration of Souls\n\n‘Firstly, a spirit within them nourishes the sky and earth,\n\nthe watery plains, the shining orb of the moon,\n\nand Titan’s star, and Mind, flowing through matter,\n\nvivifies the whole mass, and mingles with its vast frame.\n\nFrom it come the species of man and beast, and winged lives,\n\nand the monsters the sea contains beneath its marbled waves.\n\nThe power of those seeds is fiery, and their origin divine,\n\nso long as harmful matter doesn’t impede them\n\nand terrestrial bodies and mortal limbs don’t dull them.\n\nThrough those they fear and desire, and grieve and joy,\n\nand enclosed in night and a dark dungeon, can’t see the light.\n\nWhy, when life leaves them at the final hour,\n\nstill all of the evil, all the plagues of the flesh, alas,\n\nhave not completely vanished, and many things, long hardened\n\ndeep within, must of necessity be ingrained, in strange ways.\n\nSo they are scourged by torments, and pay the price\n\nfor former sins: some are hung, stretched out,\n\nto the hollow winds, the taint of wickedness is cleansed\n\nfor others in vast gulfs, or burned away with fire:\n\neach spirit suffers its own: then we are sent\n\nthrough wide Elysium, and we few stay in the joyous fields,\n\nfor a length of days, till the cycle of time,\n\ncomplete, removes the hardened stain, and leaves\n\npure ethereal thought, and the brightness of natural air.\n\nAll these others the god calls in a great crowd to the river Lethe,\n\nafter they have turned the wheel for a thousand years,\n\nso that, truly forgetting, they can revisit the vault above,\n\nand begin with a desire to return to the flesh.’\n\nBkVI:752-776 The Future Race – The Alban Kings\n\nAnchises had spoken, and he drew the Sibyl and his son, both\n\ntogether, into the middle of the gathering and the murmuring crowd,\n\nand chose a hill from which he could see all the long ranks\n\nopposite, and watch their faces as they came by him.\n\n‘Come, I will now explain what glory will pursue the children\n\nof Dardanus, what descendants await you of the Italian race,\n\nillustrious spirits to march onwards in our name, and I will teach\n\nyou your destiny. See that boy, who leans on a headless spear,\n\nhe is fated to hold a place nearest the light, first to rise\n\nto the upper air, sharing Italian blood, Silvius, of Alban name,\n\nyour last-born son, who your wife Lavinia, late in your old age,\n\nwill give birth to in the wood, a king and the father of kings,\n\nthrough whom our race will rule in Alba Longa.\n\nNext to him is Procas, glory of the Trojan people,\n\nand Capys and Numitor, and he who’ll revive your name,\n\nSilvius Aeneas, outstanding like you in virtue and arms,\n\nif he might at last achieve the Alban throne.\n\nWhat men! See what authority they display,\n\ntheir foreheads shaded by the civic oak-leaf crown!\n\nThey will build Nomentum, Gabii, and Fidenae’s city:\n\nCollatia’s fortress in the hills, Pometii\n\nand the Fort of Inus, and Bola, and Cora.\n\nThose will be names that are now nameless land.\n\nBkVI:777-807 The Future Race – Romulus and the Caesars\n\nYes, and a child of Mars will join his grandfather to accompany him,\n\nRomulus, whom his mother Ilia will bear, of Assaracus’s line.\n\nSee how Mars’s twin plumes stand on his crest, and his father\n\nmarks him out for the world above with his own emblems?\n\nBehold, my son, under his command glorious Rome\n\nwill match earth’s power and heaven’s will, and encircle\n\nseven hills with a single wall, happy in her race of men:\n\nas Cybele, the Berecynthian ‘Great Mother’, crowned\n\nwith turrets, rides through the Phrygian cities, delighting\n\nin her divine children, clasping a hundred descendants,\n\nall gods, all dwelling in the heights above.\n\nNow direct your eyes here, gaze at this people,\n\nyour own Romans. Here is Caesar, and all the offspring\n\nof Iulus destined to live under the pole of heaven.\n\nThis is the man, this is him, whom you so often hear\n\npromised you, Augustus Caesar, son of the Deified,\n\nwho will make a Golden Age again in the fields\n\nwhere Saturn once reigned, and extend the empire beyond\n\nthe Libyans and the Indians (to a land that lies outside the zodiac’s belt,\n\nbeyond the sun’s ecliptic and the year’s, where sky-carrying Atlas\n\nturns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars, on his shoulders):\n\nEven now the Caspian realms, and Maeotian earth,\n\ntremble at divine prophecies of his coming, and\n\nthe restless mouths of the seven-branched Nile are troubled.\n\nTruly, Hercules never crossed so much of the earth,\n\nthough he shot the bronze-footed Arcadian deer, brought peace\n\nto the woods of Erymanthus, made Lerna tremble at his bow:\n\nnor did Bacchus, who steers his chariot, in triumph, with reins\n\nmade of vines, guiding his tigers down from Nysa’s high peak.\n\nDo we really hesitate still to extend our power by our actions,\n\nand does fear prevent us settling the Italian lands?\n\nBkVI:808-853 The Future Race – Republic and Beyond\n\nWho is he, though, over there, distinguished by his olive branches,\n\ncarrying offerings? I know the hair and the white-bearded chin\n\nof a king of Rome, Numa, called to supreme authority\n\nfrom little Cures’s poverty-stricken earth, who will secure\n\nour first city under the rule of law. Then Tullus\n\nwill succeed him who will shatter the country’s peace,\n\nand call to arms sedentary men, ranks now unused to triumphs.\n\nThe over-boastful Ancus follows him closely,\n\ndelighting too much even now in the people’s opinion.\n\nWill you look too at Tarquin’s dynasty, and the proud spirit\n\nof Brutus the avenger, the rods of office reclaimed?\n\nHe’ll be the first to win a consul’s powers and the savage axes,\n\nand when the sons foment a new civil war, the father\n\nwill call them to account, for lovely freedom’s sake:\n\nah, to be pitied, whatever posterity says of his actions:\n\nhis love of country will prevail, and great appetite for glory.\n\nAh, see over there, the Decii and Drusi, and Torquatus\n\nbrutal with the axe, and Camillus rescuing the standards.\n\nBut those others, you can discern, shining in matching armour,\n\nsouls in harmony now, while they are cloaked in darkness,\n\nah, if they reach the light of the living, what civil war\n\nwhat battle and slaughter, they’ll cause, Julius Caesar,\n\nthe father-in-law, down from the Alpine ramparts, from the fortress\n\nof Monoecus: Pompey, the son-in-law, opposing with Eastern forces.\n\nMy sons, don’t inure your spirits to such wars,\n\nnever turn the powerful forces of your country on itself:\n\nYou be the first to halt, you, who derive your race from heaven:\n\nhurl the sword from your hand, who are of my blood!\n\nThere’s Mummius: triumphing over Corinth, he’ll drive his chariot,\n\nvictorious, to the high Capitol, famed for the Greeks he’s killed:\n\nand Aemilius Paulus, who, avenging his Trojan ancestors, and Minerva’s\n\ndesecrated shrine, will destroy Agamemnon’s Mycenae, and Argos,\n\nand Perseus the Aeacid himself, descendant of war-mighty Achilles.\n\nWho would pass over you in silence, great Cato, or you Cossus,\n\nor the Gracchus’s race, or the two Scipios, war’s lightning bolts,\n\nthe scourges of Libya, or you Fabricius, powerful in poverty,\n\nor you, Regulus Serranus, sowing your furrow with seed?\n\nFabii, where do you hurry my weary steps? You, Fabius\n\nMaximus, the Delayer, are he who alone renew our State.\n\nOthers (I can well believe) will hammer out bronze that breathes\n\nwith more delicacy than us, draw out living features\n\nfrom the marble: plead their causes better, trace with instruments\n\nthe movement of the skies, and tell the rising of the constellations:\n\nremember, Roman, it is for you to rule the nations with your power,\n\n(that will be your skill) to crown peace with law,\n\nto spare the conquered, and subdue the proud.’\n\nBkVI:854-885 The Future Race – Marcellus\n\nSo father Anchises spoke, and while they marvelled, added:\n\n‘See, how Claudius Marcellus, distinguished by the Supreme Prize,\n\ncomes forward, and towers, victorious, over other men.\n\nAs a knight, he’ll support the Roman State, turbulent\n\nwith fierce confusion, strike the Cathaginians and rebellious Gauls,\n\nand dedicate captured weapons, a third time, to father Quirinus.’\n\nAnd, at this, Aeneas said (since he saw a youth of outstanding\n\nbeauty with shining armour, walking with Marcellus,\n\nbut his face lacking in joy, and his eyes downcast):\n\n‘Father, who is this who accompanies him on his way?\n\nHis son: or another of his long line of descendants?\n\nWhat murmuring round them! What presence he has!\n\nBut dark night, with its sad shadows, hovers round his head.’\n\nThen his father Aeneas, with welling tears, replied:\n\n‘O, do not ask about your people’s great sorrow, my son.\n\nThe Fates will only show him to the world, not allow him\n\nto stay longer. The Roman people would seem\n\ntoo powerful to you gods, if this gift were lasting.\n\nWhat mourning from mankind that Field of Mars will\n\ndeliver to the mighty city! And what funeral processions\n\nyou, Tiber, will see, as you glide past his new-made tomb!\n\nNo boy of the line of Ilius shall so exalt his Latin\n\nancestors by his show of promise, nor will Romulus’s\n\nland ever take more pride in one of its sons.\n\nAlas for virtue, alas for the honour of ancient times,\n\nand a hand invincible in war! No one might have attacked him\n\nsafely when armed, whether he met the enemy on foot,\n\nor dug his spurs into the flank of his foaming charger.\n\nAh, boy to be pitied, if only you may shatter harsh fate,\n\nyou’ll be a Marcellus! Give me handfuls of white lilies,\n\nlet me scatter radiant flowers, let me load my scion’s spirit\n\nwith those gifts at least, in discharging that poor duty.’\n\nBkVI:886-901 The Gates of Sleep\n\nSo they wander here and there through the whole region,\n\nover the wide airy plain, and gaze at everything.\n\nAnd when Anchises has led his son through each place,\n\nand inflamed his spirit with love of the glory that is to come,\n\nhe tells him then of the wars he must soon fight,\n\nand teaches him about the Laurentine peoples,\n\nand the city of Latinus, and how to avoid or face each trial.\n\nThere are two gates of Sleep: one of which is said to be of horn,\n\nthrough which an easy passage is given to true shades, the other\n\ngleams with the whiteness of polished ivory, but through it\n\nthe Gods of the Dead send false dreams to the world above.\n\nAfter his words, Anchises accompanies his son there, and,\n\nfrees him, together with the Sibyl, through the ivory gate.\n\nAeneas makes his way to the ships and rejoins his friends:\n\nthen coasts straight to Caieta’s harbour along the shore.\n\nThe anchors are thrown from the prows: on the shore the sterns rest."
