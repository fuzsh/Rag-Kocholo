        "text": "Brave is one of the safest browsers on the market today. It blocks privacy-invasive ads & trackers. It blocks third-party data storage. It protects from browser fingerprinting. It upgrades every webpage possible to secure https connections. And it does all this by default.\n\nItâs also built off the open-source Chromium Web core, which powers browsers used by billions of people worldwide. This source code is arguably vetted by more security researchers than any other browser. In short, not only is Brave safe to use, itâs much safer than almost any other browser. Learn more.\n\nBrave Search is the private, independent search engine thatâs default for most new users of the Brave browser. Itâs also available in any other browser at search.brave.com. Brave Search serves fast, accurate results from its own independent index of the Web, and offers unique features like a powerful AI-answer engine. Unlike some other search engines, Brave Search doesnât profile you; it canât share, sell, or lose your personal data, because itâs not collected in the first place. Learn more about Brave Search.\n\nYes, Brave is completely free to use. Simply download the Brave browser for desktop, for Android, or for iOS to get started. You can also use Brave Search free from any browser at search.brave.com, or set it as your default search engine.\n\nBrave also has some great, subscription-based features, including Brave Talk Premium and Brave Firewall + VPN.\n\nBAT is short for Basic Attention Token. BAT is a digital asset, and a key (but totally optional) part of the Brave Rewards ecosystem. Hereâs how it works:\n\nBrave Rewards gives you the option to view first-party, privacy-protecting ads while you browse (these ads are from the Brave Private Ads network). If you choose to view them, you earn BAT via the Brave Rewards program.\n\nYou can keep BAT like any other digital asset, or use it to tip the content publishers you love. Brave even gives you a secure way to store BAT (and any other asset), with Brave Wallet. And, again, Brave Rewards is a totally optional program.\n\nOther tech companies steal your data to sell adsâto them, you are the product. Brave is different. We think your attention is valuable (and private!), and that you should get a fair share of the revenue for any advertising you choose to view. That fair share is rewarded in BAT."
