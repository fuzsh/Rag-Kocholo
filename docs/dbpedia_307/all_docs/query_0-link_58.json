        "text": "Courage, also called fortitude, is the ability to confront fear, pain, danger, uncertainty or intimidation. It can be divided into \"physical courage\" — in face of physical pain, hardship, and threat of death — and \"moral courage\" — in the face of shame, scandal, and discouragement.\n\nCourage that grows from constitution very often forsakes a man when he has occasion for it, and when it is only a kind of instinct in the Soul breaks out on all occasions without judgment or discretion. That courage which proceeds from the sense of our duty, and from the fear of offending Him that made us, acts always in a uniform manner, and according to the dictates of right reason. 117\n\nJoseph Addison, The Guardian (1713)\n\n'Tis pride, rank pride, and haughtiness of soul:\n\nI think the Romans call it Stoicism.\n\nJoseph Addison, Cato, A Tragedy (1713), Act I, scene 4.\n\nThe soul, secured in her existence, smiles At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.\n\nJoseph Addison, Cato, A Tragedy (1713), Act V, scene 1.\n\nDevelop enough courage so that you can stand up for yourself and then stand up for somebody else.\n\nMaya Angelou, in Rainbow in the Cloud: The Wisdom and Spirit of Maya Angelou (2014), p. 68\n\nWithout courage we cannot practice any other virtue with consistency. We can't be kind, true, merciful, generous, or honest.\n\nMaya Angelou, as quoted in USA Today (5 March 1988)\n\nVariant:\n\nCourage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.\n\nAs quoted in Diversity : Leaders Not Labels (2006) by Stedman Graham, p. 224.\n\nWe, unaccustomed to courage\n\nexiles from delight\n\nlive coiled in shells of loneliness\n\nuntil love leaves its high holy temple\n\nand comes into our sight\n\nto liberate us into life.\n\nMaya Angelou, in A Brave and Startling Truth (1995).\n\nCourage is a mean with regard to fear and confidence.\n\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 3.6 (1094 A.D.).\n\nTrue courage… has so little to do with Anger, that there lies always the strongest Suspicion against it, where this Passion is highest. The true Courage is the cool and calm. The bravest of Men have the least of a brutal bullying Insolence; and in the very time of Danger are found the most serene, pleasant, and free. Rage, we know, can make a Coward forget himself and fight. But what is done in Fury, or Anger, can never be plac'd to the account of Courage.\n\nAnthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711), \"Sensus Communis\".\n\nCourage is the magic that turns dreams into reality.\n\nAster and Richter Abend in Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World.\n\nThe brave man is not he who feels no fear,\n\nFor that were stupid and irrational;\n\nBut he, whose noble soul its fear subdues,\n\nAnd bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from.\n\nJoanna Baillie, Count Basil (1798), Act III, scene 1, line 151.\n\nThe VC, to my mind, has a place above all other national awards. It is the highest award for gallantry. People have it in their minds that the Victoria Cross is something special, so anyone who's got the VC must be somebody special. And they're right.\n\nGeneral Sir Peter Edgar de la Cour de la Billière, on the 2003 BBC documentary film The Victoria Cross: For Valour.\n\nGo to the edge of the cliff and jump off. Build your wings on the way down.\n\nRay Bradbury, Brown Daily Herald (March 24, 1995).\n\nQuestions at home and school should be decided in the light of the future. It is a process of toughening, but not the sort of false physical thing that we have called toughening. Our boys and girls ought to know that the bully type, the false \"tough,\" has been the first to break down under the actual fire of battle. The quiet, the calm, the determined have made the best soldiers. Why? Obviously the bully is insecure in himself- he blusters to muster his own courage. Children ought to know that. They ought to be taught to retort to the bully, \"You're a coward or you wouldn't make such a noise about being brave. The really brave man simply acts brave- he doesn't have to talk about it.\"\n\nPearl S. Buck, What America Means to Me (1943), p. 151-152\n\nWalk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (…) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day.\n\nHaidakhan Babaji, The Teachings of Babaji, 16 January 1983.\n\nNow people with courage are needed. It is better to die, facing life with courage. To live as a coward is shameful – it is better that the coward drown himself in the river. (…) Awake! Arise! Be brave!\n\nHaidakhan Babaji, The Teachings of Babaji, 5 July 1983.\n\nWhen a man is fearless, no man can stand against him in battle – either a battle in material life or in spiritual life. He is victorious in all battles of life.\n\nHaidakhan Babaji, The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983.\n\nHave the courage to think and act on your own. And have the courage to disobey.\n\nBravely Default (2013), Sage Yulyana.\n\nAll doubt is cowardice — all trust is brave.\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton, King Arthur (1848-9), Book XII, Chapter XXVIII.\n\nThe French courage proceeds from vanity — the German from phlegm — the Turkish from fanaticism & opium — the Spanish from pride — the English from coolness — the Dutch from obstinacy — the Russian from insensibility — but the Italian from anger.\n\nGeorge Gordon Noel Byron (1788–1824), British poet. in a letter to his publisher John Murray (1820).\n\nAnd each man stands with his face in the light\n\nOf his own drawn sword,\n\nReady to do what a hero can.\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning, Napoleon III in Italy (1860), VIII.\n\nValour lies just halfway between rashness and cowheartedness.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (1605-15)\n\nThere are seasons, in human affairs, of inward and outward revolution, when new depths seem to be broken up in the soul, when new wants are unfolded in multitudes, and a new and undefined good is thirsted for. There are periods when...to dare, is the highest wisdom.\n\nWilliam Ellery Channing, The Union (1829).\n\nCourage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.\n\nG.K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy, Chapter 6 (1909).\n\nMen and kings must be judged in the testing moments of their lives. Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because, as has been said, it is the quality which guarantees all others. Courage, physical and moral, King Alfonso has proved on every occasion of personal danger or political stress. Many years ago in the face of a difficult situation Alfonso made the proud declaration, no easy boast in Spain, “I was born on the throne, I shall die on it.”\n\nWinston Churchill, in an article published in “Collier’s” magazine about King Alfonso XIII of Spain on 27 June 1931. Source: 1931 June 27, Collier’s, Unlucky Alfonso by Winston Churchill, Start Page 11, Quote Page 49, Column 2, P. F. Collier and Son, New York. (Unz Database).

Archived from the original on July 7, 2023.\n\nVariant: Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, because, as has been said, 'it is the quality which guarantees all others.' Winston Churchill, Great Contemporaries, \"Alfonso XIII\" (1937).\n\nCourage is what others can't see, what is never affirmed. It is made of what you have thrown away and then come back for.\n\nLeonard Cohen. From Leonard Cohen’s journals. As quoted in: Zeus Ghosh (June 30, 2022): Hallelujah: Leonard Cohen, A Journey, A Song (2021) Review: A tryst with the God of Songs. In: High on Films. Archived from the original on March 5, 2023.

Archived from the original on March 5, 2023.\n\nTo worship to other than one's own ancestral spirits is brown-nosing. If you see what is right and fail to act on it, you lack courage.\n\nConfucius, The Analects\n\nIt may often be noticed, the less virtuous people are, the more they shrink away from the slightest whiff of the odour of un-sanctity. The good are ever the most charitable, the pure are the most brave.\n\nDinah Craik, A Woman's Thoughts About Women (1858), Ch. 11.\n\nSta come torre ferma, che non crolla\n\nGiammai la cima per soffiar de' venti.\n\nBe steadfast as a tower that doth not bend its stately summit to the tempest's shock.\n\nDante Alighieri, Purgatorio (early 14th century), V. 14.\n\nCourage is the main quality of leadership, in my opinion, no matter where it is exercised. Usually it implies some risk — especially in new undertakings. Courage to initiate something and to keep it going, pioneering and adventurous spirit to blaze new ways, often, in our land of opportunity.\n\nWalt Disney, as quoted in The Disney Way Fieldbook (2000) by Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson, Act III : Dare, p. 147.\n\nWhistling to keep myself from being afraid.\n\nJohn Dryden, Amphitryon (1690), Act III, scene 1.\n\nCourage is the price that life exacts for granting peace.\n\nThe soul that knows it not, know no release\n\nFrom little things;\n\nKnows not the livid loneliness of fear,\n\nNor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear\n\nThe sound of wings.\n\nAmelia Earhart, Courage (1927).\n\nAny intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.\n\nActually written by E. F. Schumacher in a 1973 essay titled \"Small is Beautiful\" which appeared in The Radical Humanist: volume 37, p. 22. Earliest published source found on Google Books attributing this to Einstein is BMJ: The British Medical Journal, volume 319, 23 October 1999, p. 1102. It was attributed to Einstein on the internet somewhat before that, for example in this 1997 post.\n\nCourage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, Journals, entry in 1859 (1909-1914).\n\nA great part of courage is the courage of having done the thing before.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, \"Culture,\" The Conduct of Life (1860).\n\n'Tis said that courage is common, but the immense esteem in which it is held proves it to be rare. Animal resistance, the instinct of the male animal when cornered, is no doubt common; but the pure article, courage with eyes, courage with conduct, self-possession at the cannon's mouth, cheerfulness in lonely adherence to the right, is the endowment of elevated characters.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, \"Courage,\" Society and Solitude (1870).\n\nIt is plain that there is no separate essence called courage, no cup or cell in the brain, no vessel in the heart containing drops or atoms that make or give this virtue; but it is the right or healthy state of every man, when he is free to do that which is constitutional to him to do.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson, \"Courage,\" Society and Solitude.\n\nFortitude, the virtue which enables us to endure pain, and to banish fear, is of great use in producing tranquility.\n\nEpicurus, as quoted in Ancient and Modern Celebrated Freethinkers (Half-Hours with the Freethinkers) by Charles Bradlaugh, A. Collins, and J. Watts (1877)\n\nBe scared. You can’t help that. But don’t be afraid. Ain’t nothing in the woods going to hurt you unless you corner it, or it smells that you are afraid. A bear or a deer, too, has got to be scared of a coward the same as a brave man has got to be.\n\nWilliam Faulkner, “The Bear” in The Saturday Evening Post (May 9, 1942).\n\nCourage is defined as: the ability to face danger, difficulty, uncertainty, or pain without being overcome by fear or being deflected from a chosen course of action. Many of today’s world leaders have great courage: I wonder... would we be better off with cowardice?\n\nJoshua Fernandez Courage. www.blogspot.com.\n\nPeople talk of the courage of convictions, but in actual life a man's duty to his family may make a rigid course seem a selfish indulgence of his own righteousness.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald, \"The Four Fists\", Flappers and Philosophers (1920).\n\nEither life entails courage, or it ceases to be life.\n\nE.M. Forster, Pharos and Pharillon, \"The Poetry of C.P. Cavafy\" (1923).\n\nCourage is of the heart by derivation,\n\nAnd great it is. But fear is of the soul.\n\nRobert Frost, A Masque of Mercy (1947).\n\nCourage is in the air in bracing whiffs\n\nBetter than all the stalemate an's and ifs.\n\nRobert Frost, For John F. Kennedy His Inauguration (1960).\n\nCourage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.\n\nRuth Gordon, L'Officiel (Summer 1980).\n\nCourage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are often stiffened.\n\nBilly Graham, \"A Time for Moral Courage\" Reader's Digest (July 1964).\n\nIt is when we all play safe that we create a world of utmost insecurity. It is when we all play safe that fatality will lead us to our doom. It is in the \"dark shade of courage\" alone that the spell can be broken.\n\nDag Hammarskjöld, Servant of Peace : A Selection of the Speeches and Statements of Dag Hammarskjöld, Secretary General of the United Nations (1962), p. 107.\n\nCowardly Lion: Courage! What makes a king out of a slave? Courage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave? Courage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk in the misty mist, or the dusky dusk? What makes the muskrat guard his musk? Courage! What makes the Sphinx the Seventh Wonder? Courage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder? Courage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the \"ape\" in apricot? What have they got that I ain't got?\n\nDorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman: Courage!\n\nCowardly Lion: You can say that again! Hunh!\n\nYip Harburg, from the film The Wizard of Oz (1939).\n\nCourage is the ability to ignore your options.\n\nTom Heehler, The Well-Spoken Thesaurus (March, 2011).\n\nMy darling girl, when are you going to realize that being normal is not necessarily a virtue? It rather denotes a lack of courage.\n\nAlice Hoffman Practical Magic (1995)\n\nThe onward march of the human race requires that the heights around it constantly blaze with noble lessons of courage. Deeds of daring dazzle history and form one of man's guiding lights.\n\nVictor Hugo, Les Misérables (1862).\n\nCourage, of all national qualities, is the most precarious; because it is exerted only at intervals, and by a few in every nation; whereas industry, knowledge, civility, may be of constant and universal use, and for several ages, may become habitual to the whole people.\n\nDavid Hume, Of National Characters, part I, essay XXI (1758).\n\nWinston Churchill famously claimed that of all human qualities, courage was the most esteemed, because it guaranteed all others. He was right. Courage—moral courage—is the companion of great leadership. No politician could ever be viewed as exceptional unless he or she had it in spades. And historically there would have been no social progress if not for the presence of specific humans dissenting and breaking from herd-inspired suspicion and fear.... At best, courage is self-sacrificing, non-violent, modest and based on universal principles — and immensely powerful. Think Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. Regrettably, courage is also rare: think Gandhi or MLK again. And dangerous: both men were assassinated.... Look at today’s politicians... keen to be viewed as the virile leaders of their respective countries; eager to inflate their image by harming migrants and refugees, the most vulnerable in society. If there is courage in that, I fail to see it. Authoritarian leaders, or elected leaders inclined toward it, are bullies, deceivers, selfish cowards. If they are growing in number it is because (with exceptions) many other politicians are mediocre... focused on their own image... too afraid to stand up... If we do not change course quickly, we will inevitably encounter an incident where that first domino is tipped—triggering a sequence of unstoppable events that will mark the end of our time on this tiny planet...\n\nZeid Ra’ad Al Hussein in \"Grassroots leaders provide the best hope to a troubled world,\" The Economist, (30 August 2018)\n\nMy lord, I am without fear!\n\nIshbi-Erra to Ibbi-Sin, Letter from Ishbi-Erra to Ibbi-Suen about the purchase of grain, Correspondence of the Kings of Ur, Old Babylonian period, ca. 1800-1600 BCE, at The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature; their original date of composition and their historical accuracy are debated.\n\n[C]ourage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues; because, unless a man has that virtue, he has no security for preserving any other.\n\nSamuel Johnson, quoted in James Boswell, Life of Samuel Johnson, April 5, 1775 (1791).\n\nCourage is a quality so necessary for maintaining virtue, that it is always respected, even when it is associated with vice.\n\nSamuel Johnson, quoted in James Boswell, Life of Samuel Johnson, June 11, 1784 (1791).\n\nImmaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere aude! \"Have courage to use your own understanding!\"—that is the motto of enlightenment.\n\nImmanuel Kant, \"What is Enlightenment?\"\n\nWithout belittling the courage with which men have died, we should not forget those acts of courage with which men - such as the subjects of this book - have lived. The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must—in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures—and that is the basis of all human morality.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, Profiles in Courage (1956).\n\nWhat really counts is not the immediate act of courage or of valor, but those who bear the struggle day in and day out — not the sunshine patriots but those who are willing to stand for a long period of time.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, \"Remarks at the White House to Members of the American Legion (70),\" March 1, 1962, Public Papers of the Presidents: John F. Kennedy, 1962\n\nIn whatever area in life one may meet the challenges of courage, whatever may be the sacrifices he faces if he follows his conscience — the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men — each man must decide for himself the course he will follow. The stories of past courage can define that ingredient — they can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, 1964 Memorial Edition of Profiles in Courage, p. 266\n\nIt requires courage not to surrender oneself to the ingenious or compassionate counsels of despair that would induce a man to eliminate himself from the ranks of the living; but it does not follow from this that every huckster who is fattened and nourished in self-confidence has more courage than the man who yielded to despair.\n\nSøren Kierkegaard, \"Irony as a Mastered Moment: The Truth of Irony,\" pt. 2, The Concept of Irony (1841).\n\nVictory goes to those with courage!\n\nThe King of Braves: GaoGaiGar Final (2000), Guy Shishioh\n\nComplete courage and absolute cowardice are extremes that very few men fall into. The vast middle space contains all the intermediate kinds and degrees of courage; and these differ as much from one another as men's faces or their humors do.\n\nFrançois de La Rochefoucauld, Moral Maxims and Reflections, no. 215 (1665-1678).\n\nPerfect courage is to do without witnesses what one would be capable of doing with the world looking on.\n\nFrançois de La Rochefoucauld, Moral Maxims and Reflections, no. 216.\n\nI wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.\n\nHarper Lee in To Kill a Mockingbird, Part 1, Chapter 11 (1960).\n\n[C]ourage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality. A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions.\n\nC.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters (1942), letter XXIX\n\nThis is the art of courage: to see things as they are and still believe that the victory lies not with those who avoid the bad, but those who taste, in living awareness, every drop of the good.\n\nVictoria Lincoln, \"The Art of Courage,\" Vogue (October 1, 1952).\n\nCourage is the ladder on which all the other virtues mount.\n\nClare Boothe Luce, Reader's Digest (May 1979).\n\nI learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.\n\nNelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom (1995).\n\n\"Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?\"\n\n\"That is the only time a man can be brave.\"\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones, Bran (I)—Bran and Ned\n\nCourage is the obvious virtue of the stupid.\n\nSomerset Maugham, The Door of Opportunity (in Collected Short Stories 2), p. 423\n\nIt requires greater courage to preserve inner freedom, to move on in one's inward journey into new realms, than to stand defiantly for outer freedom. It is often easier to play the martyr, as it is to be rash in battle. Strange as it sounds, steady, patient growth in freedom is probably the most difficult task of all, requiring the greatest courage. Thus if the term \"hero\" is used in this discussion at all, it must refer not to the special acts of outstanding persons, but to the heroic element potentially in every man.\n\nRollo May, Man's Search for Himself (1953), p. 174.\n\nIn any age courage is the simple virtue needed for a human being to traverse the rocky road from infancy to maturity of personality. But in an age of anxiety, an age of herd morality and personal isolation, courage is a sine qua non. In periods when the mores of the society were more consistent guides, the individual was more firmly cushioned in his crises of development; but in times of transition like ours, the individual is thrown on his own at an earlier age and for a longer period.\n\nRollo May, Man's Search for Himself (1953), p. 191.\n\nCourage is the capacity to meet the anxiety which arises as one achieves freedom. It is the willingness to differentiate, to move from the protecting realms of parental dependence to new levels of freedom and integration.\n\nRollo May, Man's Search for Himself (1953), p. 192.\n\nCourage is not a virtue of value among other personal values like love or fidelity. It is the foundation that underlies and gives reality to all other virtues and personal values. Without courage our love pales into mere dependency. Without courage our fidelity becomes conformism.\n\nRollo May, The Courage to Create (1975), Ch. 1 : The Courage to Create, p. 12.\n\nWhereas moral courage is the righting of wrongs, creative courage, in contrast, is the discovering of new forms, new symbols, new patterns on which a new society can be built.\n\nRollo May, The Courage to Create (1975), Ch. 1 : The Courage to Create, p. 21.\n\nI know what I have to do now. I got to keep breathing, because tomorrow the sun will rise. Who knows what the tide could bring?\n\nTom Hanks as Chuck Noland in Cast Away (2000)\n\nGod grant me the serenity\n\nto accept the things I cannot change,\n\ncourage to change the things I can,\n\nand the wisdom to know the difference.\n\nReinhold Niebuhr The Serenity Prayer (c. 1942).\n\nMy courage...exists to catch the future! I'll take my future into my own hands. That's what I wish for! For the courage to keep going forward!\n\nKai Ozu, interpreted by Atsushi Hashimoto in Mahou Sentai Magiranger (2005), written by Jun Maekawa, Naruhisa Arakawa, Michiko Yokote and Akatsuki Yamatoya\n\nLeve fit quod bene fertur onus.\n\nThe burden which is well borne becomes light.\n\nOvid, Amorum (16 BC), I. 2. 10.\n\nPart of having feelings is learning to integrate them into your life, Data, ...learning to live with them. No matter what the circumstances ... Sometimes it takes courage to try, Data. Courage can be an emotion too.\n\nJean-Luc Picard, Star Trek Generations (1994) story by Brannon Braga, Ronald D. Moore and Rick Berman\n\nCourage is doing what you're afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you're scared.\n\nEddie Rickenbacker, as quoted in Quote Unquote (1977) compiled by Lloyd Cory, p. 73.\n\nYou gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, \"I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.\" …You must do the thing you think you cannot do.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, You Learn by Living (1960).\n\nIt takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies; but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.\n\nJ. K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Albus Dumbledore).\n\nIf we long for our planet to be important, there is something we can do about it. We make our world significant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers.\n\nCarl Sagan, Cosmos. New York: Random House. 1980. LCC QB44.2.S235.

Except a creature be part coward it is not a compliment to say it is brave; it is merely a loose application of the word. Consider the flea! — incomparably the bravest of all the creatures of God, if ignorance of fear were courage.\n\nMark Twain, Pudd'nhead Wilson, Chapter 12 (1894).\n\nReal courage, however, is shown by those who don’t merely follow the trend or status quo, but who stand up for that which is right and truly just — and don’t kneel.\n\nAllen West, \"I'd like to see MORE football player protests — NOT less\" (27 September 2017)\n\nCourage is a moral quality; it is not a chance gift of nature like an aptitude for games. It is a cold choice between two alternatives, the fixed resolve not to quit; an act of renunciation which must be made not once but many times by the power of the will.\n\nCharles Wilson, The Anatomy of Courage (1967).\n\nSuch is the essence of valor: an unthinking moment, a spark along the spinal nerves, predetermined by the sum total of everything you have ever done, wished to do or not to do, and wish you had done, or hadn't, and then comes the pain.\n\nRoger Zelazny, The Moment of the Storm in The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth, and Other Stories (1971), p. 199 (originally published in Fantasy & Science Fiction, June 1966)\n\nQuotes reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 142-44.\n\nThe schoolboy, with his satchel in his hand,\n\nWhistling aloud to bear his courage up.\n\nRobert Blair, The Grave, Part I, line 58.\n\nOne who never turned his back but marched breast forward,\n\nNever doubted clouds would break,\n\nNever dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,\n\nHeld we fall to rise, are baffled to flight better,\n\nSleep to wake.\n\nRobert Browning, Epilogue.

The craving for religious faith being largely an outcome of fear, the advocates of faith tend to think that certain kinds of fear are not to be deprecated. In this, to my mind, they are gravely mistaken. To allow oneself to entertain pleasant beliefs as a means of avoiding fear is not to live in the best way. In so far as religion makes its appeal to fear, it is lowering to human dignity.\n\nBertrand Russell, Education and the Social Order (1932), p. 112.\n\nVirtus in astra tendit, in mortem timor.\n\nCourage leads to heaven; fear, to death.\n\nSeneca the Younger, Hercules Œtæus, LXXI.\n\nFortuna opes auferre, non animum potest.\n\nFortune can take away riches, but not courage.\n\nSeneca the Younger, Medea, CLXXVI.\n\nEi di virilità grave e maturo,\n\nMostra in fresco vigor chiome canute.\n\nGrave was the man in years, in looks, in word,\n\nHis locks were gray, yet was his courage green.\n\nTorquato Tasso, Gerusalemme, I. 53.\n\nQuod sors feret feremus æquo animo.\n\nWhatever chance shall bring, we will bear with equanimity.\n\nTerence, Phormio, I. 2. 88.\n\nQuotes reported in Josiah Hotchkiss Gilbert's Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers (1895).\n\nBe courageous. Be independent. Only remember where the true courage and independence come from.\n\nPhillips Brooks, p. 165.\n\nThis is the way to cultivate courage: First, by standing firm on some conscientious principle, some law of duty. Next, by being faithful to truth and right on small occasions and common events. Third, by trusting in God for help and power.\n\nJames F. Clarke, p. 166.\n\nConscience in the soul is the root of all true courage. If a man would be brave, let him learn to obey his conscience.\n\nJames F. Clarke, p. 167.\n\nA Christian builds his fortitude on a better foundation than stoicism; he is pleased with every thing that happens, because he knows it could not happen unless it first pleased God, and that which pleases Him must be best.\n\nCharles Caleb Colton, p. 253.\n\nConsult the honor of religion more, and your personal safety less. Is it for the honor of religion (think you) that Christians should be as timorous as hares to start at every sound?\n\nJohn Flavel, p. 166.\n\nBear your burden manfully. Boys at school, young men who have exchanged boyish liberty for serious business, — all who have got a task to do, a work to finish — bear the burden till God gives the signal for repose — till the work is done, and the holiday is fairly earned.\n\nJames Hamilton, p. 253.\n\nEvery man must bear his own burden, and it is a fine thing to see any one trying to do it manfully; carrying his cross bravely, silently, patiently, and in a way which makes you hope that he has taken for his pattern the greatest of all sufferers.\n\nJames Hamilton, p. 253.\n\nGird your hearts with silent fortitude, Suffering, yet hoping all things.\n\nFelicia Hemans, p. 253.\n\nThere is a contemptibly quiet path for all those who are afraid of the blows and clamor of opposing forces. There is no honorable fighting for a man who is not ready to forget that he has a head to be battered and a name to be bespattered. Truth wants no champion who is not as ready to be struck as to strike for her.\n\nJosiah Gilbert Holland, p. 166.\n\nProvidence has clearly ordained that the only path fit and salutary for man on earth is the path of persevering fortitude — the unremitting struggle of deliberate self-preparation and humble but active reliance on Divine aid.\n\nElias Lyman Magoon, p. 253.\n\nIn the whole range of earthly experience, no quality is more attractive and ennobling than moral courage. Like that mountain of rock which towers aloft in the Irish Sea, the man possessed of this principle is unmoved by the swelling surges which fret and fume at his feet. And yet, unlike that same Ailsa Craig, he is sensitive beyond measure to every adverse influence — battling against it, and triumphing over it by a power which proceeds from God's throne, and pervades his entire being.\n\nJohn McClellan Holmes, p. 165.\n\nWhenever you do what is holy, be of good cheer, knowing that God Himself takes part with rightful courage.\n\nMenander, p. 167.\n\nWhat we want is men with a little courage to stand up for Christ. When Christianity wakes up, and every child that belongs to the Lord is willing to speak for Him, is willing to work for Him, and, if need be, willing to die for Him, then Christianity will advance, and we shall see the work of the Lord prosper.\n\nDwight L. Moody, p. 166.\n\nTo do an evil action is base; to do a good action without incurring danger is common enough; but it is the part of a good man to do great and noble deeds, though he risks every thing.\n\nPlutarch, p. 166.\n\nMy dear friend, venture to take the wind on your face for Christ.\n\nSamuel Rutherford, p. 165.\n\nBe not cast down. If ye saw Him who is standing on the shore, holding out His arms to welcome you to land, ye would wade, not only through a sea of wrongs, but through hell itself to be with Him.\n\nSamuel Rutherford, p. 253.\n\nThe best hearts are ever the bravest.\n\nLaurence Sterne, p. 166.\n\nBravery\n\nFear\n\nValor"
