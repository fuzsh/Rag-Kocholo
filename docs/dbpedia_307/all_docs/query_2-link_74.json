        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nNewbery Honor-winning author Kirby Larson delivers a heartwarming story of friendship, love, and courage, and the incredible contributions of Navajo Code Talkers during WWII.\n\nBillie has lived with her great-aunt ever since her mom passed away and her dad left. Billie's big brother, Leo, is about to leave, too, for the warfront. But first, she gets one more weekend with him at the ranch.\n\nBillie's surprised when Leo brings home a fellow Marine from boot camp, Denny. She has so much to ask Leo -- about losing her best friend and trying to find their father -- but Denny, who is Navajo, or Din√©, comes with something special: a gorgeous, but injured, stray dog. As Billie cares for the dog, whom they name Bear, she and Bear grow deeply attached to each other.\n\nSoon enough, it's time for Leo and Denny, a Navajo Code Talker, to ship out. Billie does her part for the war effort, but she worries whether Leo and Denny will make it home, whether she'll find a new friend, and if her father will ever come back. Can Bear help Billie -- and Denny -- find what's most important?\n\nA powerful tale about unsung heroism on the WWII battlefield and the home front.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nPraise for Code Word Courage: \"With background research, including interviews with Navajo code talkers, and a knack for generating a heartwarming, genuine story, Larson seamlessly weaves the lives of the characters into the fabric of the 1944-45 home front setting.\" -- Booklist \"Remarkable, engaging and highly enjoyable historical fiction for young adults as well as all readers.\" -- Historical Novel Society \"A story of loneliness, loss, friendship, and identity.\" -- School Library Journal \"World War II continues to be a topic that fascinates young readers, and Code Word Courage will keep those obsessed with the era reading happily.\" -- YA Books CentralPraise for Liberty: * \"Larson once again creates an engaging story that is rich in historical details.
