        "text": "Powerful boy names might offer the perfect option for you as you prepare to welcome a new baby boy into your life. Consider our list of 120 strong baby boy names, which can be popular, traditional, unique, or heroic! Plus, although the overarching idea of power can certainly come from physical strength, youâll find plenty of options on our list that connote inner strength, wisdom, nature, or good character.\n\nPopular and Powerful Baby Boy Names\n\nStrong and powerful baby boy names will always be counted among the most popular monikers of any given year. Below youâll find some of the trendiest strong male names in the United States.\n\n1. Aiden. Also spelled Aidan, this name comes from the old Irish moniker AodhÃ¡n, which means âlittle fire.â If youâre looking for powerful boy names with a touch of sweetness, little Aiden might be perfect.\n\n2. Alexander. Meaning âdefending manâ in Greek, Alexander is one of those strong and bold English boy names that never go out of style. The most famous bearer of the name might be Alexander the Great, the powerful king of Macedon in the fourth century BCE.\n\n3. Ethan. The power in the name Ethan comes from an inner strength, as this popular moniker means âsolid, enduring, firm.â In the Bible, Ethan is known for the strength of wisdom.\n\n4. Henry. This classic name is making a comeback as one of the most popular strong boy names. Henry simply means âruler,â which is fitting considering many kings and other royalty bore this name.\n\n5. Hudson. Though this name stands on its own, Hudson originates from the traditional moniker Richard, which means âbrave ruler.â\n\n6. Leo. If youâre looking for strong boy names that mean âlion,â Leo is it! You might think of the Russian author Leo Tolstoy who wrote classics such as War and Peace and Anna Karenina. Leo also embodies the strength of the stars as a constellation and sign in the zodiac.\n\n7. Liam. Liam is the Irish short form of the classic name William, which comes from the Germanic elements wil and helm, meaning âdesireâ and âprotection.â\n\n8. Michael. Another classic moniker that still tops the charts, Michael is a strong Hebrew name meaning âwho is like God.â\n\n9. William. Though Liam is gaining popularity in the United States, the traditional name William is starting to make its own comeback. You could name your little boy William and call him Liam for short, both channeling the powerful meaning of âprotection.â\n\n10. Wyatt. Although itâs an old-fashioned name, Wyatt has been gaining popularity since the 1990s. It comes from the Old English name Wigheard, which means âbattleâ and âbrave, hardy.â\n\nUncommon and Rare Strong Boy Names\n\nIf youâre looking for unique and strong baby boy names, you have plenty of options. Why not give your baby boy an uncommon or rare name that still evokes a sense of power with a strong meaning?\n\n11. Amell. This strong gender-neutral name means âpower of an eagleâ in German.\n\n12. Ansaldo. This Italian boy name is quite rare and combines the Germanic elements ans and wald to create its powerful meaning. Ansaldo means âpower, leader, ruler.â\n\n13. Barrett. A cute and strong unique name for boys, Barrett comes from Old German and means âstrength of a bearâ or âbrave as a bear.â\n\n14. Burke. This Old English surname would make a subtly powerful given name, as it means âfortress.â\n\n15. Denzel. Denzel creates a powerful boysâ name with the historic meaning of âhigh stronghold.â You may associate the moniker with the actor Denzel Washington.\n\n16. Farrell. There are several boysâ names that mean âcourage,â but Farrell takes it one step further. From Ireland, the name means âman of valorâ or âman of courage.â\n\n17. Farris. If you like the meaning of the name Farrell above but want a slightly different sound, consider Farris, which is another boysâ name that means âcourage,â specifically, âman of courage.â\n\n18. Godric. If youâre a Harry Potter fan, you may like the name Godric, as in Godric Griffindor from the book and film series. The moniker combines the Old English words god and ric to mean âgodâs ruler.â\n\n19. Idris. Idris comes from the Welsh words udd and ris, which mean âardent lord.â But if youâre looking for boy names that mean âleader,â this one fits, as many also interpret udd as âleaderâ or even âprince.â The actor Idris Elba is a famous bearer of the name.\n\n20. Maverick. The English word maverick simply means âindependent,â so the name can mean âindependent one.â Interestingly, this strong American boysâ name was the moniker of a nineteenth-century Texas rancher who wouldnât brand his cattle.\n\n21. Sewell. This uncommon yet strong boys name comes with a unique twist. Sewell draws its power from nature, as the name means âstrong seaâ or âruling sea.â Thereâs nothing quite as powerful as the ocean!\n\n22. Warrick. This strong and unusual boysâ name doesnât mean âwarâ as you might assume. Rather, it has the more powerful meaning of âleader who defends.â\n\nStrong Traditional and Classic Boy Names\n\nSome of the most traditional and classic boy names come with strong, powerful meanings, too. Therefore, you donât necessarily have to stray too far from old-fashioned tradition to give your little man a strong name.\n\n23. Anders. As the Scandinavian form of Andrew, Anders is a good option for a traditional name with a twist. And because Andrew means âmanlyâ or âmasculine,â itâs one of the most obvious strong boy names for babies.\n\n24. Andrew. But if you want to keep it classic, swap Anders for Andrew and you still have the same meaning of âmanly.â Andrew is the perfect masculine boy name if youâre looking for something traditional and strong.\n\n25. Augustus. If youâre on the hunt for powerful male names with royal ties, you might want to consider Augustus. It means âgreat, magnificentâ and was used by many Roman emperors and German royalty.\n\n26. Chase. Truly a classic, the name Chase does mean âchase,â but it was originally a nickname for a hunter in the Middle Ages, which gives it a powerful edge.\n\n27. Conrad. Meaning âbrave counsel,â Conrad is an excellent choice if you want a strong name for your baby boy that goes beyond physical strength.\n\n28. Dustin. Dustin comes from the Old Norse name Torsten, which means âThorâs stone.â Thor is a famous (and incredibly strong) Norse god, and if youâre a fan of the Marvel movies, then you know why the name has such a powerful reference.,\n\n29. Ebert. Ebert is a strong American boysâ name but with foreign origins. It relates to the rare English name Everard, which means âbrave boar,â thanks to the Germanic elements, ebur and hard.\n\n30. Ferguson. If youâre reading this list in full, youâll be familiar with the meaning of Ferguson from the names Farrell and Farris above. All originate from the Irish name Fearghas, which means âman of vigorâ or âman of courage.â\n\n31. Gabriel. A classic Biblical name, Gabriel is one of the most dominant male names on this list. It combines the Hebrew words gever and el to mean âstrong man, heroâ and âGod.â It doesnât get more powerful than that!\n\n32. Jason. Coming from the Greek name Iason, Jason means âhealerâ or, from the Greek word iaomai, âto heal.â In Greek mythology, Jason was a hero who went on an epic quest to get the Golden Fleece from King Aeetes. Though thought to be an impossible mission, the quest was necessary to win back the throne from his uncle.\n\n33. Kendrick. Of all the powerful boy names to choose from, Kendrick is one that offers a few different origins and meanings. In Old English, the name either means âroyal powerâ or âbold power,â but in Welsh, it means âchief, hero.â Or, as another option, Kendrick could relate to the name Henry, which means âruler.â\n\n34. Oswald. Old-fashioned and traditional, Oswald is a strong boysâ name that means âpower, rulerâ and âgod.â Despite being one of the most powerful boy names on the list, Oswald hasnât been used in the United States since the 1930sâperhaps itâs time to bring it back!\n\n35. Peter. As one of the most traditional boy names in the United States, Australia, and Europe, Peter comes with a subtle yet powerful meaning. It means âstoneâ in Greek. In the Bible, Peter is one of the apostles of Jesus.\n\n36. Tedmond. This Old English name means âprotector of the land,â so itâs a great option if youâre looking for boy names that mean âprotectorâ or relate to a defender. 37. Victor. As far as fierce boy names go, Victor is one of those classics that canât be beat. Is there anything more fierce or powerful than a name meaning âvictor, conqueror?â\n\nTough and Heroic Boy Names\n\nIf youâre a fan of literature or simply enjoy a good story with a hero to love, perhaps youâd like to give your boy a tough or heroic name. The following monikers come from heroes of the past or offer heroic and bold meanings.\n\n38. Ambrose. In some stories, our heroes never die, which makes Ambrose such an interestingly powerful boy name. In Greek, the name simply means âimmortal.â\n\n39. Apollo. Itâs believed that Apollo means âstrength,â but thereâs a lot more to the story. In Greek mythology, Apollo was the son of Zeus and the god of the sun and prophecy, among other things.
