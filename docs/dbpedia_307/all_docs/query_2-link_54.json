        "text": "About The Red Badge of Courage\n\nStephen Crane’s immortal masterpiece about the nightmare of war was first published in 1895 and brought its young author immediate international fame. Set during the Civil War, it tells of the brutal disillusionment of a young recruit who had dreamed of the thrill and glory of war, only to find himself fleeing the horror of a battlefield. Shame over his cowardice drives him to seek to redeem himself by being wounded—earning what he calls the “red badge of courage.” Praised for its psychological insight and its intense and unprecedented realism in portraying the experience of men under fire, The Red Badge of Courage has been a beloved bestseller for more than a century.\n\nAbout The Red Badge of Courage\n\nFirst published in 1895, America’s greatest novel of the Civil War was written before 21-year-old Stephen Crane had \"smelled even the powder of a sham battle.\" But this powerful psychological study of a young soldier’s struggle with the horrors, both within and without, that war strikes the reader with its undeniable realism and with its masterful descriptions of the moment-by-moment riot of emotions felt by me under fire. Ernest Hemingway called the novel an American classic, and Crane’s genius is as much apparent in his sharp, colorful prose as in his ironic portrayal of an episode of war so intense, so immediate, so real that the terror of battle becomes our own … in a masterpiece so unique that many believe modern American fiction began with Stephen Crane.\n\nAbout The Red Badge of Courage\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create \"a psychological portrayal of fear.\" Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks \"that perhaps in a battle he might run….As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself.\" And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own \"red badge\" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. \"The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields,\" Ford Madox Ford remarked later, \"was gone forever.\" Shelby Foote, author of The Civil\n\nThe Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-\n\nable hardbound editions of impor-\n\ntant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library’s seventy-\n\nfifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring\n\nas its emblem the running torch-\n\nbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-\n\ngurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world’s best books, at the best prices.\n\nAbout The Red Badge of Courage\n\nThe Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three.
