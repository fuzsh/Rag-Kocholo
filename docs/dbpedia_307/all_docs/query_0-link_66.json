I was expecting answer like \"juSt gEt goOD\" I really love this community\n\nOkay, first of all i have study on and off sense 2020. And im about to take the JLPT N5 this year.\n\nWhy am only at N5 you may ask, i have dyslexia so language are really hard for me and im also a perfectionist. If im not getting in the 135 point range on the practice test im not satisficed. Which make me re study the MNN-books And the second is that im using English recourses (which is not my native language)\n\nI have gotten a bunch of お話しドリル which are aiming for 1-2 graders, they are written in \"formal Japanese\" but every time i open the books up it looks so dauting and i just close the book.\n\nHow will i get more courage to read and go to the \"next lvl\" ?"
