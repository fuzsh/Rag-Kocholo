        "text": "MIRANDA\n\nIf by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin’s cheek, Dashes the fire out. Oh, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her Dashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knock Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished. Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed and The fraughting souls within her.\n\nMIRANDA\n\nMy dearest father, if you used your magic to incite the wild waters into this this awful storm, please calm them. The sky is so dark it seems like it would rain down hot tar, except that the sea is swelling up to the sky and would put out the fire boiling the tar. Oh, I've suffered along with all of those I saw suffering onboard the ship! A magnificent ship—which carried, without a doubt, some noble people—was smashed to pieces. Oh, their cries shook my heart! Those poor people—they died. If I were a god with even a bit of power I would have forced the sea to sink down into the earth before it could have swallowed up that ship and all the people it carried.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nNo harm was done. All that I have done has been for you, for you, my dear daughter. You don’t know who you are. Nor do you know where I came from, or that I’m of higher rank than Prospero, your simple father who is master of some poor little shack.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nLie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel— Which thou heard’st cry, which thou sawst sink. Sit down. For thou must now know farther.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To the cloak on the ground] Lay there, my magic.\n\n[To MIRANDA] Wipe your eyes. Take comfort. As for the awful shipwreck—which touched the goodness of your heart and moved you to such compassion—I controlled it so carefully with my magic that not one person was hurt. No, not a hair was lost from the head of any person on that ship which you heard break apart and saw sink. Sit down. There's more that you must know.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nYou did—and even more than that, Miranda. But how is it possible that you can remember all this? What else do you remember through the darkness and abyss of passing time? If you remember something about your life before you came here, you may also remember how you arrived here.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nMy brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious!)— he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel. Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?\n\nPROSPERO\n\nMy brother, your uncle, whose name is Antonio—I beg you, listen carefully (oh, how could a brother be so treacherous!)—was the person whom I loved more than anyone else in the world, other than you. I trusted him to manage Milan where I ruled, which at that time was the most powerful city-state in Italy. I, Prospero, was the most powerful duke, and was admired for my dignity and my unmatched knowledge of the liberal arts. Because I spent all my time absorbed in studying secret topics, I let my brother run the government and lost contact with my city. Your lying uncle—are you listening to me?\n\nPROSPERO\n\nBeing once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who t' advance and who To trash for overtopping, new created The creatures that were mine, I say —or changed 'em, Or else new formed 'em—having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nAs soon as Antonio got the hang of how to grant some requests while denying others, of figuring out which people to promote and which to hold back in order to stop them from getting too powerful, he was able to steal the people who used to be mine. He changed them, or, you might say, remade them completely. Having power over both the government and all the people in the government, he could make everyone say or do whatever he wanted them to. He was like ivy growing up a tree, and I was like the tree—he covered me entirely until I was hidden, and sucked my vitality out of me. You’re not listening.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nI pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature. And my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie— he did believe He was indeed the duke, out o' th' substitution And executing th' outward face of royalty, With all prerogative: Hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?\n\nPROSPERO\n\nPlease, pay attention to me. I neglected all things related to ordinary life or politics, and dedicated myself entirely to seclusion in order to improve my knowledge of topics that have more value than is commonly believed. But by cutting myself off from the world, I unknowingly awoke evil in the heart of my brother. Like a good parent who raises a bad child, my trust in him produced the opposite effect, making him into a liar as big as my trust in him was—and my trust in him had no limit. My confidence in him was infinite. Now established in his position of power, and able to use all of my wealth (and whatever wealth he could use my power to take for himself), he became like a man who told a lie for so long that he began to believe it was true. He began to believe he was actually the duke. As a result of being my substitute, and acting as the royal duke in public with all the duke's rights and power, his ambition began to grow—are you listening?\n\nPROSPERO\n\nTo have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable, confederates— So dry he was for sway—wi' th' King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbowed— alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nHe was playing the role of being the duke. But to get rid of the last thing separating the role he was playing from who he was, he had to become the actual Duke of Milan. As for me—poor fool that I was—my library was as large a dukedom as I wanted. Having decided that I was unable to run or rule my city, he become so thirsty for power that he secretly allied with the King of Naples to get rid of me. In return, Antonio agreed to pay the King of Naples a certain amount of money every year; to swear to obey him; and to force his dukedom, which had always been independent—oh, poor Milan!—into the shameful position of being under Naples’ control.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nNow the condition. The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit, Which was that he, in lieu o' th' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan With all the honors on my brother. Whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th' purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and, i' th' dead of darkness, The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nNow listen to outcome of their secret alliance. The king of Naples, who had always been an enemy of mine, listened to my brother’s request. Antonio asked that the king, in return for his oath of loyalty and however much money he paid to the king each year, would immediately remove me and all of immediate family from Milan, and then give the dukedom to my brother. So then, they raised an army to pull off this treachery. At midnight on the date they’d chosen to act, Antonio opened the gates of Milan, and in the deep darkness had the agents he’d chosen for the job rush me and you, crying, out of there.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nWell demanded, wench. My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but With colors fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast. The very rats Instinctively had quit it. There they hoist us To cry to th' sea that roared to us, to sigh To th' winds whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nGood question, my dear girl. My story does indeed bring up that question. My dear, they didn’t dare. Because I was so loved by the people of Milan, Antonio and Alonso had to keep any blood from staining their actions, and hide their evil goals behind a prettier picture. In short, they hurried us onto a ship and carried us a few miles out to sea. There, they had prepared a rotten shell of a boat that had no ropes, equipment, sails, or a mast. Even the rats had abandoned it when they sensed its likelihood to sink.They lowered us down into the water. We were left to cry out to the sea, which just roared back at us. We sighed in sadness to the wind, which sighed back in pity. And in doing so it buffeted us with winds that—no matter how loving—only made us more uncomfortable.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nBy providence divine. Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries, Which since have steaded much. So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nWith the help of God. A nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had been put in charge of the task of abandoning us at sea. Out of charity, he gave us some food and fresh water, as well as clothes, linens, supplies, and other necessities that have over the years been so useful. Also, he was so noble and kind, that, knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nNow I will stand up. [He stands up and puts on his magic cloak] Sit still, and listen to the rest of the story of our sad times at sea. We arrived here on this island. I, as your teacher here, have given you a better education than other princesses get, because they have so many opportunities to spend their time more foolishly and do not pay as close attention to their teachers.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nKnow thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune (Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies Brought to this shore. And by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions. Thou art inclined to sleep. 'Tis a good dullness, And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nYou should know this much: by a strange chance, the goddess of luck (whom I now love) has brought my old enemies to this island. And by my magic senses, I can tell that my opportunity for good fortune depends on this lucky circumstance. And if I do not act but instead do nothing, then I will never again have such an opportunity. No more questions now. You are sleepy. It’s a good time for sleepiness, so give in to it. I know you have no choice.\n\nARIEL\n\nTo every article. I boarded the king’s ship. Now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement. Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places. On the topmast, The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors O' th' dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake.\n\nARIEL\n\nDown to the last detail. I boarded the king’s ship. And from the prow, to the middle of the ship, to the stern, and in every cabin, I took the form of a fire and sent everyone into a terror. Sometimes I would divide myself, and burn at many places at once. I burned on the main mast, the yards extending from the mast—and, at the same time, split to burn the bowsprit extending from the prow. Then I joined back together to form a single flame. Not even Jove's lightning—which precedes and then causes thunder—could move as fast as I did. The fire and deafening cracks of my burning seemed to terrify even mighty Neptune, the god of the sea, and made his waves tremble and his weapon—the trident—shake.\n\nARIEL\n\nEvery person on the ship was like a madman and did desperate things. Everyone except the sailors jumped into the rough sea to escape the ship that I had set on fire. The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—looking like reeds instead of hair—was the first one who jumped, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!”\n\nARIEL\n\nNot even a hair was harmed on anyone’s head. The clothes that helped keep them afloat in the water not only didn’t get stained, but are in fact cleaner than they were before the storm. And, as you told me to do, I’ve scattered everyone from the ship in a few different groups around the island. I brought the king’s son all by himself to the land, on a far corner of the island. He’s sitting there with his arms crossed like this in sadness [ARIEL crosses his arms], and cooling the air with his sighs.\n\nARIEL\n\nSafely in harbor Is the king’s ship. In the deep nook where once Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she’s hid. The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor, I have left asleep. And for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wracked And his great person perish.\n\nARIEL\n\nThe king’s ship is safely harbored and hidden in that deep inlet where you once summoned me at midnight to go get dew from the stormy Bermuda Islands. The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both because of a spell I put them under, and also because of how tired they are from all their effort during the storm. As for the rest of the fleet, I scattered them. They've all met up in the Mediterranean Sea, and are now sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they saw the shipwreck of the king’s ship—and therefore the death of their great king.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nOh, was she really? I’ll have to tell the story again every month, since you seem to forget it. This damned witch Sycorax was thrown out of Algiers for committing so many crimes and performing magic too terrible to even describe. There was just one reason why they didn’t kill her. Isn’t that true?\n\nPROSPERO\n\nThis blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, wast then her servant. And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine, within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island— Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born—not honored with A human shape.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nThis hag—with bags under her eyes—was brought to this island while pregnant, and was left here by the sailors. You, my slave, as you yourself have said, were her servant then. And, because you were too kind and sensitive to carry out her dirty and disgusting commands, you refused her orders. In a rage that could not be calmed, and with the help of her most powerful spirits, she locked you into a hole in the middle of a pine tree that had been split in two. You were painfully imprisoned there for twelve years. During that time she died and you were stuck there, groaning in pain at the same rate that the blades of a mill wheel hit the water. At that time the island had no people on it, other than the son that Sycorax gave birth to on the island—that freckled son of a hag.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nDull thing, I say so. He, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears. It was a torment To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax Could not again undo. It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nI already said that, you stupid thing. Caliban, who I now keep as a servant. You know better than anyone the pain you were in when I found you. Your groans made wolves howl, and made perpetually angry bears feel pity for you. The spell that Sycorax put on you—and which she could not undo—was something fit only for souls damned to hell. When I arrived on the island and heard you, it was my magic that made the pine tree open and let you out.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nFor saying that, rest assured, I’ll give you cramps, pains in your sides that will make it hard to breathe. Goblins shaped like hedgehogs will come out at night when they are free to act, and do their worst to you. Every inch of you will be stung, and each sting will hurt more than beestings.\n\nCALIBAN\n\nI must eat my dinner. This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst give me Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee And showed thee all the qualities o' th' isle, The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and fertile. Cursed be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king. And here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o' th' island.\n\nCALIBAN\n\nIt’s time for my dinner. This island is mine, given to me by my mother Sycorax. You took it from me. When you first came here, you petted me and treated me well. You would give me water with berries in it, and you taught me the names for the sun burning in the daytime sky and the moon which lights the night. I loved you then, and I showed you all the features of the island—the freshwater springs, the saltwater pits, the places that were good for growing things and those that were not. A curse on me for doing all that! May all the evil spells of Sycorax torment you with toads, beetles, and bats! I’m the only subject you have on this island, where once I was my own king. And now you keep me confined in this cave and don’t let me go anywhere else on the island.\n\nMIRANDA\n\nAbhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes With words that made them known. But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison.\n\nMIRANDA\n\nYou repulsive slave! You who are completely resistant to any effort to make you good, and are instead capable of every evil thing! I pitied you. I made the effort to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing nearly every hour. When you, savage, didn’t know the meaning of the words you were speaking, and would babble like some beast, I gave you words that would let you make your desires understood. But even though you learned, your evil nature made it so that people who were good could not stand to be with you. And so, just as you deserved, you were sent to live in this cave, which is a more suitable place for you to live than a prison would be.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nYou son of a hag, get going! Bring us firewood. And you’d better be quick, because I have other work for you. Are you shrugging as if refusing my orders, you evil thing? If you neglect my commands, or perform them grudgingly, I’ll overwhelm your body with painful cramps. I'll fill your bones with aches, and make you scream so that the wild animals will tremble at the noise you make.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nWhere should this music be? I' th' air or th' earth? It sounds no more, and sure, it waits upon Some god o' th' island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone. No, it begins again.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nWhere is that music coming from? From the air or the ground? It’s no longer playing—probably it plays for some god of this island. As I sat on a sandbank on the beach crying again about my father’s shipwreck, I heard the music over the roaring of the waves, and it calmed the fury of the water and soothed my intense sadness with its sweet sound. I’ve followed it here, or maybe I should say it led me here. But now it’s gone. No, it’s started up again.\n\nFERDINAND\n\n[seeing MIRANDA] Most sure, the goddess On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island, And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here. My prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! If you be maid or no.\n\nFERDINAND\n\n[Seeing MIRANDA] Obviously, this must be the goddess for whom the music is playing! Please answer my prayer, and let me know if you live on this island, and explain to me how I should behave here. But my most important question, which I’ve saved for last, is—oh, you wondrous being—are you a girl or something else?\n\nFERDINAND\n\nThe same thing I am doing now as I stand here amazed to hear you mention Naples. He does hear me, and it makes me cry that he hears me. I myself am the King of Naples—I saw with my own eyes, which haven’t been dry since—my father killed by a shipwreck.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To himself] The real Duke of Milan and his even finer daughter could control you right now, if now were the right time to do it. They’ve fallen in love at first sight!\n\n[To ARIEL] Beautiful Ariel, I’ll set you free for making this happen.\n\n[To FERDINAND] May I speak with you, sir? I’m afraid you’ve may have said something untrue. It won’t take more than a moment.\n\nMIRANDA\n\n[To herself] Why is my father speaking to him so rudely? This is the third man that I’ve ever seen in my life, and the first one for whom I’ve ever felt such feelings that made me sigh. I hope my father is compassionate enough to me that he wants for me what I want for myself!\n\nPROSPERO\n\nSoft, sir! One word more. [ aside] They are both in either’s powers, but this swift business I must uneasy make lest too light winning Make the prize light. [To FERDINAND] One word more. I charge thee That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not, and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy to win it From me, the lord on ’t.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To FERDINAND] Wait, sir! I have one more thing to say.\n\n[To himself] They’re in love with each other. But I have to put some obstacles in the way of this quick love, so that they don’t undervalue their love because it came so easily.\n\n[To FERDINAND] Just one more thing to say. I demand that you listen to me. You are stealing a name for yourself that does not belong to you. You’ve come to this island as a spy to try to take this island from me, its lord.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n[To MIRANDA] What? Do you, my daughter—who owes me obedience—dare to tell me what to do?\n\n[To FERDINAND] Sheathe your sword, traitor. You put on a nice show there, but you wouldn’t dare to actually strike me because you feel too guilty. Step out of your defensive position. For, if I wanted to, I could use this magic wand to disarm you and make your sword drop.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nSilence! One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What, An advocate for an imposter? Hush, Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench, To th' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels.\n\nPROSPERO\n\nSilence! If you say another word, I’ll scold you, maybe even hate you. What, you’re taking the side of an impostor? Be quiet. You think no one else is as beautiful as him, because you’ve seen only him and Caliban. Foolish girl, to most people this man looks like a Caliban, and compared to him, most people look like angels.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nSo they are. My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth Let liberty make use of. Space enough Have I in such a prison.\n\nFERDINAND\n\nThey are. My strength is all tied up, as if in a bad dream. The loss of my father, the physical weakness I feel, the destruction of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s captured me would be like nothing to me, if I could just look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl. I would not need to have the freedom to go anywhere else in the world. A prison like that would give me all the space I needed."
