        "text": "Courage is the quality of being ready and willing to face negative situations involving danger or pain.\n\nA close synonym is bravery. Showing courage is often thought of as facing such situations without fear, but it also involves facing them despite fear. In other words, someone who has courage might not be fearless, but they face the dangerous, difficult, or frightening situation anyway.\n\nThe adjective courageous means having, showing, or done with courage. It can be used to describe people who have courage, or the actions of such people when they face negative situations resolutely. A close synonym is brave.\n\nExample: We should all show our appreciation for the courage of our first responders, who face danger every day but still, somehow, decide to show up and put the wellbeing of other people before their own safety.\n\nThe first records of the word courage come from the 1200s. It comes from the Old French corage, from cuer, meaning “heart” (this ultimately derives from the Latin cor, meaning “heart”).\n\nThe heart is traditionally depicted as the center of human emotion, and the word heart is commonly used in a figurative way to refer to courage or bravery—someone who has courage is said to have a lot of heart. Being courageous means that even when a situation is dangerous or scary—when it makes your heart start beating very fast—you’re still willing to face it. But courage doesn’t always involve facing danger. Something as simple as telling the truth when it will result in negative consequences can be courageous.\n\nCourage is always used positively. It’s associated with heroic people and actions—like firefighters running into burning buildings to save people—but it can be used in many different situations."
