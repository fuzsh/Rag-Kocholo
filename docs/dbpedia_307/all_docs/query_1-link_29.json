Because of this, we had no delinquents.\n\nWithout a prison, there can be no delinquents.\n\nWe had no locks nor keys and therefore among us there were no thieves.\n\nWhen someone was so poor that he couldn't afford a horse, a tent or a blanket,\n\nhe would, in that case, receive it all as a gift.\n\nWe were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property.\n\nWe didn't know any kind of money and consequently, the value of a human being\n\nwas not determined by his wealth.\n\nWe had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians,\n\ntherefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another.\n\nWe were really in bad shape before the white men arrived and I don't know\n\nhow to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things\n\nthat (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.\n\n- John (Fire) Lame Deer, Sioux Lakota (1903-1976)\n\nBack to top\n\nLakota Prayer\n\nWakan Tanka, Great Mystery,\n\nteach me how to trust\n\nmy heart,\n\nmy mind,\n\nmy intuition,\n\nmy inner knowing,\n\nthe senses of my body,\n\nthe blessings of my spirit.\n\nTeach me to trust these things\n\nso that I may enter my Sacred Space\n\nand love beyond my fear,\n\nand thus Walk in Balance\n\nwith the passing of each glorious Sun.\n\n- Found on: https://www.sapphyr.net/natam/quotes-nativeamerican.htm\n\nBack to top\n\nAncient Indian Proverb\n\nYou have noticed that everything an Indian does in a circle,\n\nand that is because the Power of the World always works in circles,\n\nand everything and everything tries to be round.\n\nIn the old days all our power came to us from the sacred hoop\n\nof the nation and so long as the hoop was unbroken the people\n\nflourished. The flowering tree was the living center of the hoop,\n\nand the circle of the four quarters nourished it. The east gave peace\n\nand light, the south gave warmth, the west gave rain and the north\n\nwith its cold and mighty wind gave strength and endurance. This\n\nknowledge came to us from the outer world with our religion.\n\nEverything the power of the world does is done in a circle.\n\nThe sky is round and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball\n\nand so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls.\n\nBirds make their nests in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours.\n\nThe sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle. The moon\n\ndoes the same and both are round. Even the seasons form a great\n\ncircle in their changing and always come back again to where they were.\n\nThe life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is\n\nin everything where power moves. Our teepees were round like the\n\nnests of birds, and these were always set in a circle, the nation's hoop,\n\na nest of many nests, where the Great Spirit meant for us to hatch our children.\n\n- Black Elk, Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux 1863-1950\n\nBack to top\n\nMay all I say and all I think\n\nbe in harmony with thee,\n\nGod within me,\n\nGod beyond me,\n\nmaker of the trees.\n\n- Chinook prayer, Pacific Northwest Coast\n\nBack to top\n\nA Three Step Morning Prayer\n\nFirst Step: Plant your feet firmly on the earth. Using your five senses, give thanks to our Creator God for the countless ways God comes to us through creation- for all the beauty that your eyes see, for all the sounds that your ears ear, for all the scents that you smell, the tastes that you taste, for all that you feel (the sun, wind, rain, snow, warm, or cold). Pray this day that you may be open and attuned to the countless ways that our Creator God comes to us through your senses, through the gifts of creation.\n\nSecond Step: Let go of all the pain, struggle, regret, failures, garbage of yesterday - step out of it - leave it behind- brush the dust of it from your feet.\n\nThird Step: With this third and final step, step into the gift of the new day, full of hope, promise, and potential. Give thanks for the gift of this new day, which God has made!\n\nAmen.\n\n- Jose Hobday\n\nBack to top\n\nPrayer of The Seven Directions\n\nBegin facing EAST- This is where the sun comes up, and so the direction of new beginnings, hope, promise, and potential. Pray that you may be open to receiving these gifts this day.* Each turn is a quarter turn to your right.\n\nTurn SOUTH - This is the direction of warmth, growth, fertility (!), also known as creativity and productivity. In addition, this direction represents faith, trust, and faithfulness in relationships. Pray for these things this day.\n\nTurn WEST - This is the direction where the sun goes down. Thus, it is the direction of rest, of our dream lives, and of closure and endings that need to take place in order for there to be new beginnings. Pray for these things this day.\n\nTurn NORTH - This is the direction of the cold, of winds, of strength, courage, fortitude, might, single-mindedness, focus, clarity and purpose. Pray for these things this day.\n\nTurn back to the EAST - and turn UPWARD. For Native Americans this is the direction of Father Sky. Pray that your heart,\n\nmind, soul, and spirit will not forget to look upward this day, to the One who is so much greater than we are.\n\nTurn DOWNWARD - and touch our Mother, the earth. Pray that everything you do this day will be in honor and reverence of our Mother Earth.\n\nTurn INWARD- Place your hand on your heart and pray that all that you do this day will be true to the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit who dwells within you.\n\nAmen.\n\nFor additional Prayers, visit these websites:\n\nWorld healing prayers\n\nNative American Poems and Prayers"
