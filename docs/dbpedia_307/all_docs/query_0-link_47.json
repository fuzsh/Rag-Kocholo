        "text": "Life can be full of challenges, sorrows, and tough decisions. But even amidst hardship, the Lord counsels us to be strong and courageous. Understanding Joshua 1:9 in the Bible can help us face hard things with faith and confidence.\n\nThe children of Israel had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years and it was up to Joshua to lead them into the promised land. He’d have to claim the land from its current inhabitants, fight and lead battles, and provide spiritual leadership for a large group of people. As he was feeling the overwhelming weight of the task before him, the Lord offered these words of encouragement:\n\nPart of being strong and of a good courage means trusting in the Lord as our true source of strength. In Joshua’s case, he didn’t have all the answers for the challenges before him. But he was counseled to go forward anyway, acting in faith. Like Joshua, we seldom have all the answers to our personal challenges. But God promises that when we turn to Him for guidance, we will succeed. God is all-powerful and all-knowing. He has the answers and the strength we need to face any challenge before us. He was with Joshua, and He will be with us.\n\nBeing strong and courageous usually doesn’t require any grand gestures. More often, it’s made up of small decisions we make every day that show our trust in God. As we prayerfully seek His direction, study His word, and follow His example each day, we will have the courage to let go of fear and face our challenges with faith. As you turn to Jesus Christ in faith and follow His counsel to be strong and of a good courage, you will feel the assurance that He is always with you."
