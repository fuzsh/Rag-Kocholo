For the quest, see Wind, Courage, and Wings.\n\nWind, Courage, and Wings is a Quest Item obtained during the Glide With the Wind in Amber's Story Quest, Lepus Chapter: Act I - Wind, Courage, and Wings.\n\nText[]\n\nWhen the first wisp of wind brushed across the land\n\nBirds that yearned for the sky had wings\n\nBut no way to fly\n\nThey asked the Anemo God:\n\n\"How can we reach the heavens?\"\n\nTo which the Anemo God replied:\n\n\"You have yet to find that which is most important\"\n\nAs the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion\n\nHigh into the sky\n\nThe birds thrust out their wings\n\nBut the breeze was all too mild\n\nLeaving them to stumble across the earth\n\nSo they went to the gorge\n\nWhere the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength\n\nThey threw themselves off the cliff\n\nAnd flapped their wings amongst the howling winds\n\nUntil they were able to fly freely in the sky\n\nTo the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:\n\n\"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly\"\n\nIn reply the Anemo God said:\n\n\"What you lacked was not wind, but courage\"\n\n\"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world\"\n\nGallery[]\n\nOther Languages[]\n\nLanguageOfficial NameLiteral MeaningEnglishWind, Courage, and Wings—Chinese\n\n(Simplified)风、勇气和翅膀\n\nFēng, Yǒngqì hé ChìbǎngWind, Courage, and WingsChinese\n\n(Traditional)風、勇氣和翅膀\n\nFēng, Yǒngqì hàn ChìbǎngJapanese風、勇気と翼\n\nKaze, Yuuki to TsubasaWind, Courage, and WingsKorean바람, 용기와 날개\n\nBaram, Yonggiwa NalgaeWind, Courage, and WingsSpanishViento, coraje y alasWind, Courage, and WingsFrenchVents, courage & ailesWinds, Courage & WingsRussianВетер, храбрость и крылья\n\nVeter, khrabrost' i kryl'yaWind, Courage, and WingsThaiสายลม, ความกล้าและปีก\n\nVietnameseGió, Đôi Cánh Và Dũng KhíDũng Khí勇氣Wind, Wings, and CourageGermanVon Wind, Tapferkeit und FlügelnOf Wind, Courage and WingsIndonesianAngin, Keberanian, dan SayapWind, Courage, and WingsPortugueseVento, Coragem e AsasWind, Courage, and WingsTurkishRüzgar, Cesaret ve KanatlarWind, Courage, and WingsItalianIl vento, il coraggio e le ali"
