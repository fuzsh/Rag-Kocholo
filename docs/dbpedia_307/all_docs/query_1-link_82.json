The consideration of which would serve to animate him to the work he was called unto, to encourage his faith in God, to engage in his service cheerfully and readily:\n\nbe strong, and of a good courage; (See Gill on Joshua 1:6); (See Gill on Joshua 1:7).\n\nbe not afraid, nor be thou dismayed;\n\nat his enemies, numerous and powerful, nor discouraged at anything in himself, any unfitness for such service, as he might think, or at any difficulties he might fear from the people he had the government of, and was to lead on; it was enough that the divine Presence was promised him, and which is repeated:\n\nfor the Lord thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest:\n\nor, as the Targum of Jonathan,\n\n``for thy help is the Word of the Lord thy God;''\n\n(See Gill on Joshua 1:5)."
