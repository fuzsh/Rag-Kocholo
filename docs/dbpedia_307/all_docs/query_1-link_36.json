What Myrmidon,\n\nor Dolopian, or warrior of fierce Ulysses, could keep\n\nfrom tears in telling such a story? Now the dew-filled night\n\nis dropping from the sky, and the setting stars urge sleep.\n\nBut if you have such desire to learn of our misfortunes,\n\nand briefly hear of Troy’s last agonies, though my mind\n\nshudders at the memory, and recoils in sorrow, I’ll begin.\n\n‘After many years have slipped by, the leaders of the Greeks,\n\nopposed by the Fates, and damaged by the war,\n\nbuild a horse of mountainous size, through Pallas’s divine art,\n\nand weave planks of fir over its ribs:\n\nthey pretend it’s a votive offering: this rumour spreads.\n\nThey secretly hide a picked body of men, chosen by lot,\n\nthere, in the dark body, filling the belly and the huge\n\ncavernous insides with armed warriors.\n\nTenedos is within sight, an island known to fame,\n\nrich in wealth when Priam’s kingdom remained,\n\nnow just a bay and an unsafe anchorage for boats:\n\nthey sail there, and hide themselves, on the lonely shore.\n\nWe thought they had gone, and were seeking Mycenae\n\nwith the wind. So all the Trojan land was free of its long sorrow.\n\nThe gates were opened: it was a joy to go and see the Greek camp,\n\nthe deserted site and the abandoned shore.\n\nHere the Dolopians stayed, here cruel Achilles,\n\nhere lay the fleet, here they used to meet us in battle.\n\nSome were amazed at virgin Minerva’s fatal gift,\n\nand marvel at the horse’s size: and at first Thymoetes,\n\nwhether through treachery, or because Troy’s fate was certain,\n\nurged that it be dragged inside the walls and placed on the citadel.\n\nBut Capys, and those of wiser judgement, commanded us\n\nto either hurl this deceit of the Greeks, this suspect gift,\n\ninto the sea, or set fire to it from beneath,\n\nor pierce its hollow belly, and probe for hiding places.\n\nThe crowd, uncertain, was split by opposing opinions.\n\nThen Laocoön rushes down eagerly from the heights\n\nof the citadel, to confront them all, a large crowd with him,\n\nand shouts from far off: ‘O unhappy citizens, what madness?\n\nDo you think the enemy’s sailed away? Or do you think\n\nany Greek gift’s free of treachery? Is that Ulysses’s reputation?\n\nEither there are Greeks in hiding, concealed by the wood,\n\nor it’s been built as a machine to use against our walls,\n\nor spy on our homes, or fall on the city from above,\n\nor it hides some other trick: Trojans, don’t trust this horse.\n\nWhatever it is, I’m afraid of Greeks even those bearing gifts.’\n\nSo saying he hurled his great spear, with extreme force,\n\nat the creature’s side, and into the frame of the curved belly.\n\nThe spear stuck quivering, and at the womb’s reverberation\n\nthe cavity rang hollow and gave out a groan.\n\nAnd if the gods’ fate, if our minds, had not been ill-omened,\n\nhe’d have incited us to mar the Greeks hiding-place with steel:\n\nTroy would still stand: and you, high tower of Priam would remain.\n\nBkII:57-144 Sinon’s Tale\n\nSee, meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, shouting loudly,\n\ndragging a youth, his hands tied behind his back, to the king.\n\nIn order to contrive this, and lay Troy open to the Greeks,\n\nhe had placed himself in their path, calm in mind, and ready\n\nfor either course: to engage in deception, or find certain death.\n\nThe Trojan youth run, crowding round, from all sides,\n\nto see him, and compete in mocking the captive.\n\nListen now to Greek treachery, and learn of all their crimes\n\nfrom just this one. Since, as he stood, looking troubled,\n\nunarmed, amongst the gazing crowd,\n\nand cast his eyes around the Phrygian ranks,\n\nhe said: ‘Ah! What land, what seas would accept me now?\n\nWhat’s left for me at the last in my misery, I who have\n\nno place among the Greeks, when the hostile Trojans,\n\nthemselves, demand my punishment and my blood?\n\nAt this the mood changed and all violence was checked.\n\nWe urged him to say what blood he was sprung from,\n\nand why he suffered: and tell us what trust could be placed\n\nin him as a captive. Setting fear aside at last he speaks:\n\n“O king, I’ll tell you the whole truth, whatever happens,\n\nand indeed I’ll not deny that I’m of Argive birth:\n\nthis first of all: if Fortune has made me wretched,\n\nshe’ll not also wrongly make me false and a liar.\n\nIf by any chance some mention of Palamedes’s name\n\nhas reached your ears, son of Belus, and talk\n\nof his glorious fame, he whom the Pelasgians,\n\non false charges of treason, by atrocious perjury,\n\nbecause he opposed the war, sent innocent to his death,\n\nand who they mourn, now he’s taken from the light:\n\nwell my father, being poor, sent me here to the war\n\nwhen I was young, as his friend, as we were blood relatives.\n\nWhile Palamades was safe in power, and prospered\n\nin the kings’ council, I also had some name and respect.\n\nBut when he passed from this world above, through\n\nthe jealousy of plausible Ulysses (the tale’s not unknown)\n\nI was ruined, and spent my life in obscurity and grief,\n\ninwardly angry at the fate of my innocent friend.\n\nMaddened I could not be silent, and I promised, if chance allowed,\n\nand if I ever returned as a victor to my native Argos,\n\nto avenge him, and with my words stirred bitter hatred.\n\nThe first hint of trouble came to me from this, because of it\n\nUlysses was always frightening me with new accusations,\n\nspreading veiled rumours among the people, and guiltily\n\nseeking to defend himself. He would not rest till, with Calchas\n\nas his instrument – but why I do unfold this unwelcome story?\n\nWhy hinder you? If you consider all Greeks the same,\n\nand that’s sufficient, take your vengeance now: that’s what\n\nthe Ithacan wants, and the sons of Atreus would pay dearly for.”\n\nThen indeed we were on fire to ask, and seek the cause,\n\nignorant of such wickedness and Pelasgian trickery.\n\nTrembling with fictitious feelings he continued, saying:\n\n“The Greeks, weary with the long war, often longed\n\nto leave Troy and execute a retreat: if only they had!\n\nOften a fierce storm from the sea land-locked them,\n\nand the gale terrified them from leaving:\n\nonce that horse, made of maple-beams, stood there,\n\nespecially then, storm-clouds thundered in the sky.\n\nAnxious, we send Eurypylus to consult Phoebus’s oracle,\n\nand he brings back these dark words from the sanctuary:\n\n‘With blood, and a virgin sacrifice, you calmed the winds,\n\nO Greeks, when you first came to these Trojan shores, seek your\n\nreturn in blood, and the well-omened sacrifice of an Argive life.’\n\nWhen this reached the ears of the crowd, their minds were stunned,\n\nand an icy shudder ran to their deepest marrow:\n\nwho readies this fate, whom does Apollo choose?\n\nAt this the Ithacan thrust the seer, Calchas, into their midst,\n\ndemanding to know what the god’s will might be,\n\namong the uproar. Many were already cruelly prophesying\n\nthat ingenious man’s wickedness towards me, and silently saw\n\nwhat was coming. For ten days the seer kept silence, refusing\n\nto reveal the secret by his words, or condemn anyone to death.\n\nBut at last, urged on by Ulysses’s loud clamour, he broke\n\ninto speech as agreed, and doomed me to the altar.\n\nAll acclaimed it, and what each feared himself, they endured\n\nwhen directed, alas, towards one man’s destruction.\n\nNow the terrible day arrived, the rites were being prepared\n\nfor me, the salted grain, and the headbands for my forehead.\n\nI confess I saved myself from death, burst my bonds,\n\nand all that night hid by a muddy lake among the reeds,\n\ntill they set sail, if as it happened they did.\n\nAnd now I’ve no hope of seeing my old country again,\n\nor my sweet children or the father I long for:\n\nperhaps they’ll seek to punish them for my flight,\n\nand avenge my crime through the death of these unfortunates.\n\nBut I beg you, by the gods, by divine power that knows the truth,\n\nby whatever honour anywhere remains pure among men, have pity\n\non such troubles, pity the soul that endures undeserved suffering.”\n\nBkII:145-194 Sinon Deludes the Trojans\n\nWith these tears we grant him his life, and also pity him.\n\nPriam himself is the first to order his manacles and tight bonds\n\nremoved, and speaks these words of kindness to him:\n\n“From now on, whoever you are, forget the Greeks, lost to you:\n\nyou’ll be one of us. And explain to me truly what I ask:\n\nWhy have they built this huge hulk of a horse? Who created it?\n\nWhat do they aim at? What religious object or war machine is it?”\n\nHe spoke: the other, schooled in Pelasgian art and trickery,\n\nraised his unbound palms towards the stars, saying:\n\n“You, eternal fires, in your invulnerable power, be witness,\n\nyou altars and impious swords I escaped,\n\nyou sacrificial ribbons of the gods that I wore as victim:\n\nwith right I break the Greek’s solemn oaths,\n\nwith right I hate them, and if things are hidden\n\nbring them to light: I’m bound by no laws of their country.\n\nOnly, Troy, maintain your assurances, if I speak truth, if I repay\n\nyou handsomely: kept intact yourself, keep your promises intact.\n\nAll the hopes of the Greeks and their confidence to begin the war\n\nalways depended on Pallas’s aid. But from that moment\n\nwhen the impious son of Tydeus, Diomede, and Ulysses\n\ninventor of wickedness, approached the fateful Palladium to snatch\n\nit from its sacred temple, killing the guards on the citadel’s heights,\n\nand dared to seize the holy statue, and touch the sacred ribbons\n\nof the goddess with blood-soaked hands: from that moment\n\nthe hopes of the Greeks receded, and slipping backwards ebbed:\n\ntheir power fragmented, and the mind of the goddess opposed them.\n\nPallas gave sign of this, and not with dubious portents,\n\nfor scarcely was the statue set up in camp, when glittering flames\n\nshone from the upturned eyes, a salt sweat ran over its limbs,\n\nand (wonderful to tell) she herself darted from the ground\n\nwith shield on her arm, and spear quivering.\n\nCalchas immediately proclaimed that the flight by sea must be\n\nattempted, and that Troy cannot be uprooted by Argive weapons,\n\nunless they renew the omens at Argos, and take the goddess home,\n\nwhom they have indeed taken by sea in their curved ships.\n\nAnd now they are heading for their native Mycenae with the wind,\n\nobtaining weapons and the friendship of the gods, re-crossing\n\nthe sea to arrive unexpectedly, So Calchas reads the omens.\n\nWarned by him, they’ve set up this statue of a horse\n\nfor the wounded goddess, instead of the Palladium,\n\nto atone severely for their sin. And Calchas ordered them\n\nto raise the huge mass of woven timbers, raised to the sky,\n\nso the gates would not take it, nor could it be dragged\n\ninside the walls, or watch over the people in their ancient rites.\n\nSince if your hands violated Minerva’s gift,\n\nthen utter ruin (may the gods first turn that prediction\n\non themselves!) would come to Priam and the Trojans:\n\nyet if it ascended into your citadel, dragged by your hands,\n\nAsia would come to the very walls of Pelops, in mighty war,\n\nand a like fate would await our children.”\n\nBkII:195-227 Laocoön and the Serpents\n\nThrough these tricks and the skill of perjured Sinon, the thing was\n\ncredited, and we were trapped, by his wiliness, and false tears,\n\nwe, who were not conquered by Diomede, or Larissan Achilles,\n\nnor by the ten years of war, nor those thousand ships.\n\nThen something greater and more terrible befalls\n\nus wretches, and stirs our unsuspecting souls.\n\nLaocoön, chosen by lot as priest of Neptune,\n\nwas sacrificing a huge bull at the customary altar.\n\nSee, a pair of serpents with huge coils, snaking over the sea\n\nfrom Tenedos through the tranquil deep (I shudder to tell it),\n\nand heading for the shore side by side: their fronts lift high\n\nover the tide, and their blood-red crests top the waves,\n\nthe rest of their body slides through the ocean behind,\n\nand their huge backs arch in voluminous folds.\n\nThere’s a roar from the foaming sea: now they reach the shore,\n\nand with burning eyes suffused with blood and fire,\n\nlick at their hissing jaws with flickering tongues.\n\nBlanching at the sight we scatter. They move\n\non a set course towards Laocoön: and first each serpent\n\nentwines the slender bodies of his two sons,\n\nand biting at them, devours their wretched limbs:\n\nthen as he comes to their aid, weapons in hand, they seize him too,\n\nand wreathe him in massive coils: now encircling his waist twice,\n\ntwice winding their scaly folds around his throat,\n\ntheir high necks and heads tower above him.\n\nHe strains to burst the knots with his hands,\n\nhis sacred headband drenched in blood and dark venom,\n\nwhile he sends terrible shouts up to the heavens,\n\nlike the bellowing of a bull that has fled wounded,\n\nfrom the altar, shaking the useless axe from its neck.\n\nBut the serpent pair escape, slithering away to the high temple,\n\nand seek the stronghold of fierce Pallas, to hide there\n\nunder the goddess’s feet, and the circle of her shield.\n\nBkII:228-253 The Horse Enters Troy\n\nThen in truth a strange terror steals through each shuddering heart,\n\nand they say that Laocoön has justly suffered for his crime\n\nin wounding the sacred oak-tree with his spear,\n\nby hurling its wicked shaft into the trunk.\n\n“Pull the statue to her house”, they shout,\n\n“and offer prayers to the goddess’s divinity.”\n\nWe breached the wall, and opened up the defences of the city.\n\nAll prepare themselves for the work and they set up wheels\n\nallowing movement under its feet, and stretch hemp ropes\n\nround its neck. That engine of fate mounts our walls\n\npregnant with armed men. Around it boys, and virgin girls,\n\nsing sacred songs, and delight in touching their hands to the ropes:\n\nUp it glides and rolls threateningly into the midst of the city.\n\nO my country, O Ilium house of the gods, and you,\n\nTrojan walls famous in war! Four times it sticks at the threshold\n\nof the gates, and four times the weapons clash in its belly:\n\nyet we press on regardless, blind with frenzy,\n\nand site the accursed creature on top of our sacred citadel.\n\nEven then Cassandra, who, by the god’s decree, is never\n\nto be believed by Trojans, reveals our future fate with her lips.\n\nWe unfortunate ones, for whom that day is our last,\n\nclothe the gods’ temples, throughout the city, with festive branches.\n\nMeanwhile the heavens turn, and night rushes from the Ocean,\n\nwrapping the earth, and sky, and the Myrmidons’ tricks,\n\nin its vast shadow: through the city the Trojans\n\nfall silent: sleep enfolds their weary limbs.\n\nBkII:254-297 The Greeks Take the City\n\n‘The Fall of Troy and the Escape of Aeneas’ - Giorgio Ghisi (Italy, 1520-1582), LACMA Collections\n\nAnd now the Greek phalanx of battle-ready ships sailed\n\nfrom Tenedos, in the benign stillness of the silent moon,\n\nseeking the known shore, when the royal galley raised\n\na torch, and Sinon, protected by the gods’ unjust doom,\n\nsets free the Greeks imprisoned by planks of pine,\n\nin the horses’ belly. Opened, it releases them to the air,\n\nand sliding down a lowered rope, Thessandrus, and Sthenelus,\n\nthe leaders, and fatal Ulysses, emerge joyfully\n\nfrom their wooden cave, with Acamas, Thoas,\n\nPeleus’s son Neoptolemus, the noble Machaon,\n\nMenelaus, and Epeus who himself devised this trick.\n\nThey invade the city that’s drowned in sleep and wine,\n\nkill the watchmen, welcome their comrades\n\nat the open gates, and link their clandestine ranks.\n\nIt was the hour when first sleep begins for weary mortals,\n\nand steals over them as the sweetest gift of the gods.\n\nSee, in dream, before my eyes, Hector seemed to stand there,\n\nsaddest of all and pouring out great tears,\n\ntorn by the chariot, as once he was, black with bloody dust,\n\nand his swollen feet pierced by the thongs.\n\nAh, how he looked! How changed he was\n\nfrom that Hector who returned wearing Achilles’s armour,\n\nor who set Trojan flames to the Greek ships! His beard was ragged,\n\nhis hair matted with blood, bearing those many wounds he received\n\ndragged around the walls of his city.\n\nAnd I seemed to weep myself, calling out to him,\n\nand speaking to him in words of sorrow:\n\n“Oh light of the Troad, surest hope of the Trojans,\n\nwhat has so delayed you? What shore do you come from\n\nHector, the long-awaited? Weary from the many troubles\n\nof our people and our city I see you, oh, after the death\n\nof so many of your kin! What shameful events have marred\n\nthat clear face? And why do I see these wounds?’\n\nHe does not reply, nor does he wait on my idle questions,\n\nbut dragging heavy sighs from the depths of his heart, he says:\n\n“Ah! Son of the goddess, fly, tear yourself from the flames.\n\nThe enemy has taken the walls: Troy falls from her high place.\n\nEnough has been given to Priam and your country: if Pergama\n\ncould be saved by any hand, it would have been saved by this.\n\nTroy entrusts her sacred relics and household gods to you:\n\ntake them as friends of your fate, seek mighty walls for them,\n\nthose you will found at last when you have wandered the seas.”\n\nSo he speaks, and brings the sacred headbands in his hands\n\nfrom the innermost shrine, potent Vesta, and the undying flame.\n\nBkII:298-354 Aeneas Gathers his Comrades\n\nMeanwhile the city is confused with grief, on every side,\n\nand though my father Anchises’s house is remote, secluded\n\nand hidden by trees, the sounds grow clearer and clearer,\n\nand the terror of war sweeps upon it.\n\nI shake off sleep, and climb to the highest roof-top,\n\nand stand there with ears strained:\n\nas when fire attacks a wheat-field when the south-wind rages,\n\nor the rushing torrent from a mountain stream covers the fields,\n\ndrowns the ripe crops, the labour of oxen,\n\nand brings down the trees headlong, and the dazed shepherd,\n\nunaware, hears the echo from a high rocky peak.\n\nNow the truth is obvious, and the Greek plot revealed.\n\nNow the vast hall of Deiphobus is given to ruin\n\nthe fire over it: now Ucalegon’s nearby blazes:\n\nthe wide Sigean straits throw back the glare.\n\nThen the clamour of men and the blare of trumpets rises.\n\nFrantically I seize weapons: not because there is much use\n\nfor weapons, but my spirit burns to gather men for battle\n\nand race to the citadel with my friends: madness and anger\n\nhurl my mind headlong, and I think it beautiful to die fighting.\n\nNow, see, Panthus escaping the Greek spears,\n\nPanthus, son of Othrys, Apollo’s priest on the citadel,\n\ndragging along with his own hands the sacred relics,\n\nthe conquered gods, his little grandchild, running frantically\n\nto my door: “Where’s the best advantage, Panthus, what position\n\nshould we take?” I’d barely spoken, when he answered\n\nwith a groan: “The last day comes, Troy’s inescapable hour.\n\nTroy is past, Ilium is past, and the great glory of the Trojans:\n\nJupiter carries all to Argos: the Greeks are lords of the burning city.\n\nThe horse, standing high on the ramparts, pours out warriors,\n\nand Sinon the conqueror exultantly stirs the flames.\n\nOthers are at the wide-open gates, as many thousands\n\nas ever came from great Mycenae: more have blocked\n\nthe narrow streets with hostile weapons:\n\na line of standing steel with naked flickering blades\n\nis ready for the slaughter: barely the first few guards\n\nat the gates attempt to fight, and they resist in blind conflict.”\n\nBy these words from Othrys’ son, and divine will, I’m thrust\n\namongst the weapons and the flames, where the dismal Fury\n\nsounds, and the roar, and the clamour rising to the sky.\n\nFriends joined me, visible in the moonlight, Ripheus,\n\nand Epytus, mighty in battle, Hypanis and Dymas,\n\ngathered to my side, and young Coroebus, Mygdon’s son:\n\nby chance he’d arrived in Troy at that time,\n\nburning with mad love for Cassandra, and brought help,\n\nas a potential son-in-law, to Priam, and the Trojans,\n\nunlucky man, who didn’t listen to the prophecy\n\nof his frenzied bride! When I saw them crowded there\n\neager for battle, I began as follows: “Warriors, bravest\n\nof frustrated spirits, if your ardent desire is fixed\n\non following me to the end, you can see our cause’s fate.\n\nAll the gods by whom this empire was supported\n\nhave departed, leaving behind their temples and their altars:\n\nyou aid a burning city: let us die and rush into battle.\n\nThe beaten have one refuge, to have no hope of refuge.”\n\nBkII:355-401 Aeneas and his Friends Resist\n\nSo their young spirits were roused to fury. Then, like ravaging\n\nwolves in a dark mist, driven blindly by the cruel rage\n\nof their bellies, leaving their young waiting with thirsty jaws,\n\nwe pass through our enemies, to certain death, and make our way\n\nto the heart of the city: dark night envelops us in deep shadow.\n\nWho could tell of that destruction in words, or equal our pain\n\nwith tears? The ancient city falls, she who ruled for so many years:\n\ncrowds of dead bodies lie here and there in the streets,\n\namong the houses, and on the sacred thresholds of the gods.\n\nNor is it Trojans alone who pay the penalty with their blood:\n\ncourage returns at times to the hearts of the defeated\n\nand the Greek conquerors die. Cruel mourning is everywhere,\n\neverywhere there is panic, and many a form of death.\n\nFirst, Androgeos, meets us, with a great crowd of Greeks\n\naround him, unknowingly thinking us allied troops,\n\nand calls to us in friendly speech as well:\n\n“Hurry, men! What sluggishness makes you delay so?\n\nThe others are raping and plundering burning Troy:\n\nare you only now arriving from the tall ships?”\n\nHe spoke, and straight away (since no reply given was\n\ncredible enough) he knew he’d fallen into the enemy fold.\n\nHe was stunned, drew back, and stifled his voice.\n\nLike a man who unexpectedly treads on a snake in rough briars,\n\nas he strides over the ground, and shrinks back in sudden fear\n\nas it rears in anger and swells its dark-green neck,\n\nso Androgeos, shuddering at the sight of us, drew back.\n\nWe charge forward and surround them closely with weapons,\n\nand ignorant of the place, seized by terror, as they are, we slaughter\n\nthem wholesale. Fortune favours our first efforts.\n\nAnd at this Coroebus, exultant with courage and success, cries:\n\n“Oh my friends, where fortune first points out the path to safety,\n\nand shows herself a friend, let us follow. Let’s change our shields\n\nadopt Greek emblems. Courage or deceit: who’ll question it in war?\n\nThey’ll arm us themselves.” With these words, he takes up Androgeos’s\n\nplumed helmet, his shield with its noble markings,\n\nand straps the Greek’s sword to his side. Ripheus does likewise,\n\nDymas too, and all the warriors delight in it. Each man\n\narms himself with the fresh spoils. We pass on\n\nmingling with the Greeks, with gods that are not our known,\n\nand clash, in many an armed encounter, in the blind night,\n\nand we send many a Greek down to Orcus.\n\nSome scatter to the ships, and run for safer shores,\n\nsome, in humiliated terror, climb the vast horse again\n\nand hide in the womb they know.\n\nBkII:402-437 Cassandra is Taken\n\n“Ah, put no faith in anything the will of the gods opposes!\n\nSee, Priam’s virgin daughter dragged, with streaming hair,\n\nfrom the sanctuary and temple of Minerva,\n\nlifting her burning eyes to heaven in vain:\n\nher eyes, since cords restrained her gentle hands.\n\nCoroebus could not stand the sight, maddened in mind,\n\nand hurled himself among the ranks, seeking death.\n\nWe follow him, and, weapons locked, charge together.\n\nHere, at first, we were overwhelmed by Trojan spears,\n\nhurled from the high summit of the temple,\n\nand wretched slaughter was caused by the look of our armour,\n\nand the confusion arising from our Greek crests.\n\nThen the Danaans, gathering from all sides, groaning with anger\n\nat the girl being pulled away from them, rush us,\n\nAjax the fiercest, the two Atrides, all the Greek host:\n\njust as, at the onset of a tempest, conflicting winds clash, the west,\n\nthe south, and the east that joys in the horses of dawn:\n\nthe forest roars, brine-wet Nereus rages with his trident,\n\nand stirs the waters from their lowest depths.\n\nEven those we have scattered by a ruse, in the dark of night,\n\nand driven right through the city, re-appear: for the first time\n\nthey recognise our shields and deceitful weapons,\n\nand realise our speech differs in sound to theirs.\n\nIn a moment we’re overwhelmed by weight of numbers:\n\nfirst Coroebus falls, by the armed goddess’s altar, at the hands\n\nof Peneleus: and Ripheus, who was the most just of all the Trojans,\n\nand keenest for what was right (the gods’ vision was otherwise):\n\nHypanis and Dymas die at the hands of allies:\n\nand your great piety, Panthus, and Apollo’s sacred headband\n\ncan not defend you in your downfall.\n\nAshes of Ilium, death flames of my people, be witness\n\nthat, at your ruin, I did not evade the Danaan weapons,\n\nnor the risks, and, if it had been my fate to die,\n\nI earned it with my sword. Then we are separated,\n\nIphitus and Pelias with me, Iphitus weighed down by the years,\n\nand Pelias, slow-footed, wounded by Ulysses:\n\nimmediately we’re summoned to Priam’s palace by the clamour.\n\nBkII:438-485 The Battle for the Palace\n\nHere’s a great battle indeed, as if the rest of the war were nothing,\n\nas if others were not dying throughout the whole city,\n\nso we see wild War and the Greeks rushing to the palace,\n\nand the entrance filled with a press of shields.\n\nLadders cling to the walls: men climb the stairs under the very\n\ndoorposts, with their left hands holding defensive shields\n\nagainst the spears, grasping the sloping stone with their right.\n\nIn turn, the Trojans pull down the turrets and roof-tiles\n\nof the halls, prepared to defend themselves even in death,\n\nseeing the end near them, with these as weapons:\n\nand send the gilded roof-beams down, the glory\n\nof their ancient fathers. Others with naked swords block\n\nthe inner doors: these they defend in massed ranks.\n\nOur spirits were reinspired, to bring help to the king’s palace,\n\nto relieve our warriors with our aid, and add power to the beaten.\n\nThere was an entrance with hidden doors, and a passage in use\n\nbetween Priam’s halls, and a secluded gateway beyond,\n\nwhich the unfortunate Andromache, while the kingdom stood,\n\noften used to traverse, going, unattended, to her husband’s parents,\n\ntaking the little Astyanax to his grandfather.\n\nI reached the topmost heights of the pediment from which\n\nthe wretched Trojans were hurling their missiles in vain.\n\nA turret standing on the sloping edge, and rising from the roof\n\nto the sky, was one from which all Troy could be seen,\n\nthe Danaan ships, and the Greek camp: and attacking its edges\n\nwith our swords, where the upper levels offered weaker mortar,\n\nwe wrenched it from its high place, and sent it flying:\n\nfalling suddenly it dragged all to ruin with a roar,\n\nand shattered far and wide over the Greek ranks.\n\nBut more arrived, and meanwhile neither the stones\n\nnor any of the various missiles ceased to fly.\n\nIn front of the courtyard itself, in the very doorway of the palace,\n\nPyrrhus exults, glittering with the sheen of bronze:\n\nlike a snake, fed on poisonous herbs, in the light,\n\nthat cold winter has held, swollen, under the ground,\n\nand now, gleaming with youth, its skin sloughed,\n\nripples its slimy back, lifts its front high towards the sun,\n\nand darts its triple-forked tongue from its jaws.\n\nHuge Periphas, and Automedon the armour-bearer,\n\ndriver of Achilles’s team, and all the Scyrian youths,\n\nadvance on the palace together and hurl firebrands onto the roof.\n\nPyrrhus himself among the front ranks, clutching a double-axe,\n\nbreaks through the stubborn gate, and pulls the bronze doors\n\nfrom their hinges: and now, hewing out the timber, he breaches\n\nthe solid oak and opens a huge window with a gaping mouth.\n\nThe palace within appears, and the long halls are revealed:\n\nthe inner sanctums of Priam, and the ancient kings, appear,\n\nand armed men are seen standing on the very threshold.\n\nBkII:486-558 Priam’s Fate\n\nBut, inside the palace, groans mingle with sad confusion,\n\nand, deep within, the hollow halls howl\n\nwith women’s cries: the clamour strikes the golden stars.\n\nTrembling mothers wander the vast building, clasping\n\nthe doorposts, and placing kisses on them. Pyrrhus drives forward,\n\nwith his father Achilles’s strength, no barricades nor the guards\n\nthemselves can stop him: the door collapses under the ram’s blows,\n\nand the posts collapse, wrenched from their sockets.\n\nStrength makes a road: the Greeks, pour through, force a passage,\n\nslaughter the front ranks, and fill the wide space with their men.\n\nA foaming river is not so furious, when it floods,\n\nbursting its banks, overwhelms the barriers against it,\n\nand rages in a mass through the fields, sweeping cattle and stables\n\nacross the whole plain. I saw Pyrrhus myself, on the threshold,\n\nmad with slaughter, and the two sons of Atreus:\n\nI saw Hecuba, her hundred women, and Priam at the altars,\n\npolluting with blood the flames that he himself had sanctified.\n\nThose fifty chambers, the promise of so many offspring,\n\nthe doorposts, rich with spoils of barbarian gold,\n\ncrash down: the Greeks possess what the fire spares.\n\nAnd maybe you ask, what was Priam’s fate.\n\nWhen he saw the end of the captive city, the palace doors\n\nwrenched away, and the enemy among the inner rooms,\n\nthe aged man clasped his long-neglected armour\n\non his old, trembling shoulders, and fastened on his useless sword,\n\nand hurried into the thick of the enemy seeking death.\n\nIn the centre of the halls, and under the sky’s naked arch,\n\nwas a large altar, with an ancient laurel nearby, that leant\n\non the altar, and clothed the household gods with shade.\n\nHere Hecuba, and her daughters, like doves driven\n\nby a dark storm, crouched uselessly by the shrines,\n\nhuddled together, clutching at the statues of the gods.\n\nAnd when she saw Priam himself dressed in youthful armour\n\nshe cried: “What mad thought, poor husband, urges you\n\nto fasten on these weapons? Where do you run?\n\nThe hour demands no such help, nor defences such as these,\n\nnot if my own Hector were here himself. Here, I beg you,\n\nthis altar will protect us all or we’ll die together.”\n\nSo she spoke and drew the old man towards her,\n\nand set him down on the sacred steps.\n\nSee, Polites, one of Priam’s sons, escaping Pyrrhus’s slaughter,\n\nruns down the long hallways, through enemies and spears,\n\nand, wounded, crosses the empty courts.\n\nPyrrhus chases after him, eager to strike him,\n\nand grasps at him now, and now, with his hand, at spear-point.\n\nWhen finally he reached the eyes and gaze of his parents,\n\nhe fell, and poured out his life in a river of blood.\n\nPriam, though even now in death’s clutches,\n\ndid not spare his voice at this, or hold back his anger:\n\n“If there is any justice in heaven, that cares about such things,\n\nmay the gods repay you with fit thanks, and due reward\n\nfor your wickedness, for such acts, you who have\n\nmade me see my own son’s death in front of my face,\n\nand defiled a father’s sight with murder.\n\nYet Achilles, whose son you falsely claim to be, was no\n\nsuch enemy to Priam: he respected the suppliant’s rights,\n\nand honour, and returned Hector’s bloodless corpse\n\nto its sepulchre, and sent me home to my kingdom.”\n\nSo the old man spoke, and threw his ineffectual spear\n\nwithout strength, which immediately spun from the clanging bronze\n\nand hung uselessly from the centre of the shield’s boss.\n\nPyrrhus spoke to him: “Then you can be messenger, carry\n\nthe news to my father, to Peleus’s son: remember to tell him\n\nof degenerate Pyrrhus, and of my sad actions:\n\nnow die.” Saying this he dragged him, trembling,\n\nand slithering in the pool of his son’s blood, to the very altar,\n\nand twined his left hand in his hair, raised the glittering sword\n\nin his right, and buried it to the hilt in his side.\n\nThis was the end of Priam’s life: this was the death that fell to him\n\nby lot, seeing Troy ablaze and its citadel toppled, he who was\n\nonce the magnificent ruler of so many Asian lands and peoples.\n\nA once mighty body lies on the shore, the head\n\nshorn from its shoulders, a corpse without a name.\n\nBkII:559-587 Aeneas Sees Helen\n\nThen for the first time a wild terror gripped me.\n\nI stood amazed: my dear father’s image rose before me\n\nas I saw a king, of like age, with a cruel wound,\n\nbreathing his life away: and my Creusa, forlorn,\n\nand the ransacked house, and the fate of little Iulus.\n\nI looked back, and considered the troops that were round me.\n\nThey had all left me, wearied, and hurled their bodies to earth,\n\nor sick with misery dropped into the flames.\n\nSo I was alone now, when I saw the daughter of Tyndareus,\n\nHelen, close to Vesta’s portal, hiding silently\n\nin the secret shrine: the bright flames gave me light,\n\nas I wandered, gazing everywhere, randomly.\n\nAfraid of Trojans angered at the fall of Troy,\n\nGreek vengeance, and the fury of a husband she deserted,\n\nshe, the mutual curse of Troy and her own country,\n\nhad concealed herself and crouched, a hated thing, by the altars.\n\nFire blazed in my spirit: anger rose to avenge my fallen land,\n\nand to exact the punishment for her wickedness.\n\n“Shall she, unharmed, see Sparta again and her native Mycenae,\n\nand see her house and husband, parents and children,\n\nand go in the triumphant role of a queen,\n\nattended by a crowd of Trojan women and Phrygian servants?\n\nWhen Priam has been put to the sword? Troy consumed with fire?\n\nThe Dardanian shore soaked again and again with blood?\n\nNo. Though there’s no great glory in a woman’s punishment,\n\nand such a conquest wins no praise, still I will be praised\n\nfor extinguishing wickedness and exacting well-earned\n\npunishment, and I’ll delight in having filled my soul\n\nwith the flame of revenge, and appeased my people’s ashes.”\n\nBkII:588-623 Aeneas is Visited by his Mother Venus\n\n‘Helen Saved by Venus from the Wrath of Aeneas’ - Jacques Sablet (Switzerland, 1749-1803), LACMA Collections\n\nI blurted out these words, and was rushing on with raging mind,\n\nwhen my dear mother came to my vision, never before so bright\n\nto my eyes, shining with pure light in the night,\n\ngoddess for sure, such as she may be seen by the gods,\n\nand taking me by the right hand, stopped me, and, then,\n\nimparted these words to me from her rose-tinted lips:\n\n“My son, what pain stirs such uncontrollable anger?\n\nWhy this rage? Where has your care for what is ours vanished?\n\nFirst will you not see whether Creusa, your wife, and your child\n\nAscanius still live, and where you have left your father Anchises\n\nworn-out with age? The Greek ranks surround them on all sides,\n\nand if my love did not protect them, the flames would have caught\n\nthem before now, and the enemy swords drunk of their blood.\n\nYou do not hate the face of the Spartan daughter of Tyndareus,\n\nnor is Paris to blame: the ruthlessness of the gods, of the gods,\n\nbrought down this power, and toppled Troy from its heights.\n\nSee (for I’ll tear away all the mist that now, shrouding your sight,\n\ndims your mortal vision, and darkens everything with moisture:\n\ndon’t be afraid of what your mother commands, or refuse to obey\n\nher wisdom): here, where you see shattered heaps of stone\n\ntorn from stone, and smoke billowing mixed with dust,\n\nNeptune is shaking the walls, and the foundations, stirred\n\nby his mighty trident, and tearing the whole city up by it roots.\n\nThere, Juno, the fiercest, is first to take the Scaean Gate, and,\n\nsword at her side, calls on her troops from the ships, in rage.\n\nNow, see, Tritonian Pallas, standing on the highest towers,\n\nsending lightning from the storm-cloud, and her grim Gorgon\n\nbreastplate. Father Jupiter himself supplies the Greeks with\n\ncourage, and fortunate strength, himself excites the gods against\n\nthe Trojan army. Hurry your departure, son, and put an end\n\nto your efforts. I will not leave you, and I will place you\n\nsafe at your father’s door.” She spoke, and hid herself\n\nin the dense shadows of night. Dreadful shapes appeared,\n\nand the vast powers of gods opposed to Troy.\n\nBkII:624-670 Aeneas Finds his Family\n\nThen in truth all Ilium seemed to me to sink in flames,\n\nand Neptune’s Troy was toppled from her base:\n\njust as when foresters on the mountain heights\n\ncompete to uproot an ancient ash tree, struck\n\ntime and again by axe and blade, it threatens continually\n\nto fall, with trembling foliage and shivering crown,\n\ntill gradually vanquished by the blows it groans at last,\n\nand torn from the ridge, crashes down in ruin.\n\nI descend, and, led by a goddess, am freed from flames\n\nand enemies: the spears give way, and the flames recede.\n\nAnd now, when I reached the threshold of my father’s house,\n\nand my former home, my father, whom it was my first desire\n\nto carry into the high mountains, and whom I first sought out,\n\nrefused to extend his life or endure exile, since Troy had fallen.\n\n“Oh, you,” he cried, “whose blood has the vigour of youth,\n\nand whose power is unimpaired in its force, it’s for you\n\nto take flight. As for me, if the gods had wished to lengthen\n\nthe thread of my life, they’d have spared my house. It is\n\nmore than enough that I saw one destruction, and survived\n\none taking of the city. Depart, saying farewell to my body\n\nlying here so, yes so. I shall find death with my own hand:\n\nthe enemy will pity me, and look for plunder. The loss\n\nof my burial is nothing. Clinging to old age for so long,\n\nI am useless, and hated by the gods, ever since\n\nthe father of the gods and ruler of men breathed the winds\n\nof his lightning-bolt onto me, and touched me with fire.”\n\nSo he persisted in saying, and remained adamant.\n\nWe, on our side, Creusa, my wife, and Ascanius, all our household,\n\nweeping bitterly, determined that he should not destroy everything\n\nalong with himself, and crush us by urging our doom.\n\nHe refused and clung to his place and his purpose.\n\nI hurried to my weapons again, and, miserably, longed for death,\n\nsince what tactic or opportunity was open to us now?\n\n“ Did you think I could leave you, father, and depart?\n\nDid such sinful words fall from your lips?\n\nIf it pleases the gods to leave nothing of our great city standing,\n\nif this is set in your mind, if it delights you to add yourself\n\nand all that’s yours to the ruins of Troy, the door is open\n\nto that death: soon Pyrrhus comes, drenched in Priam’s blood,\n\nhe who butchers the son in front of the father, the father at the altar.\n\nKind mother, did you rescue me from fire and sword\n\nfor this, to see the enemy in the depths of my house,\n\nand Ascanius, and my father, and Creusa, slaughtered,\n\nthrown together in a heap, in one another’s blood?\n\nWeapons men, bring weapons: the last day calls to the defeated.\n\nLead me to the Greeks again: let me revisit the battle anew.\n\nThis day we shall not all perish unavenged.”\n\nBkII:671-704 The Omen\n\nSo, again, I fasten on my sword, slip my left arm\n\ninto the shield’s strap, adjust it, and rush from the house.\n\nBut see, my wife clings to the threshold, clasps my foot,\n\nand holds little Iulus up towards his father:\n\n“If you go to die, take us with you too, at all costs: but if\n\nas you’ve proved you trust in the weapons you wear,\n\ndefend this house first. To whom do you abandon little Iulus,\n\nand your father, and me, I who was once spoken of as your wife?”\n\nCrying out like this she filled the whole house with her groans,\n\nwhen suddenly a wonder, marvellous to speak of, occurred.\n\nSee, between the hands and faces of his grieving parents,\n\na gentle light seemed to shine from the crown\n\nof Iulus’s head, and a soft flame, harmless in its touch,\n\nlicked at his hair, and grazed his forehead.\n\nTrembling with fear, we hurry to flick away the blazing strands,\n\nand extinguish the sacred fires with water.\n\nBut Anchises, my father, lifts his eyes to the heavens, in delight,\n\nand raises his hands and voice to the sky:\n\n“All-powerful Jupiter, if you’re moved by any prayers,\n\nsee us, and, grant but this: if we are worthy through our virtue,\n\nshow us a sign of it, Father, and confirm your omen.”\n\nThe old man had barely spoken when, with a sudden crash,\n\nit thundered on the left, and a star, through the darkness,\n\nslid from the sky, and flew, trailing fire, in a burst of light.\n\nWe watched it glide over the highest rooftops,\n\nand bury its brightness, and the sign of its passage,\n\nin the forests of Mount Ida: then the furrow of its long track\n\ngave out a glow, and, all around, the place smoked with sulphur.\n\nAt this my father, truly overcome, raised himself towards the sky,\n\nand spoke to the gods, and proclaimed the sacred star.\n\n“Now no delay: I follow, and where you lead, there am I.\n\nGods of my fathers, save my line, save my grandson.\n\nThis omen is yours, and Troy is in your divine power.\n\nI accept, my son, and I will not refuse to go with you.”\n\nBkII:705-729 Aeneas and his Family Leave Troy\n\n‘Aeneas and His Family Fleeing Troy’ - Agostino Carracci (Italy, 1557-1602), Yale University Art Gallery\n\nHe speaks, and now the fire is more audible,\n\nthrough the city, and the blaze rolls its tide nearer.\n\n“Come then, dear father, clasp my neck: I will\n\ncarry you on my shoulders: that task won’t weigh on me.\n\nWhatever may happen, it will be for us both, the same shared risk,\n\nand the same salvation. Let little Iulus come with me,\n\nand let my wife follow our footsteps at a distance.\n\nYou servants, give your attention to what I’m saying.\n\nAt the entrance to the city there’s a mound, an ancient temple\n\nof forsaken Ceres, and a venerable cypress nearby,\n\nprotected through the years by the reverence of our fathers:\n\nlet’s head to that one place by diverse paths.\n\nYou, father, take the sacred objects, and our country’s gods,\n\nin your hands: until I’ve washed in running water,\n\nit would be a sin for me, coming from such fighting\n\nand recent slaughter, to touch them.” So saying, bowing my neck,\n\nI spread a cloak made of a tawny lion’s hide over my broad\n\nshoulders, and bend to the task: little Iulus clasps his hand\n\nin mine, and follows his father’s longer strides.\n\nMy wife walks behind. We walk on through the shadows\n\nof places, and I whom till then no shower of spears,\n\nnor crowd of Greeks in hostile array, could move,\n\nnow I’m terrified by every breeze, and startled by every noise,\n\nanxious, and fearful equally for my companion and my burden.\n\nBkII:730-795 The Loss of Creusa\n\nAnd now I was near the gates, and thought I had completed\n\nmy journey, when suddenly the sound of approaching feet\n\nfilled my hearing, and, peering through the darkness,\n\nmy father cried: “My son, run my son, they are near us:\n\nI see their glittering shields and gleaming bronze.”\n\nSome hostile power, at this, scattered my muddled wits.\n\nfor while I was following alleyways, and straying\n\nfrom the region of streets we knew, did my wife Creusa halt,\n\nsnatched away from me by wretched fate?\n\nOr did she wander from the path or collapse with weariness?\n\nWho knows? She was never restored to our sight,\n\nnor did I look back for my lost one, or cast a thought behind me,\n\nuntil we came to the mound, and ancient Ceres’s sacred place.\n\nHere when all were gathered together at last, one was missing,\n\nand had escaped the notice of friends, child and husband.\n\nWhat man or god did I not accuse in my madness:\n\nwhat did I know of in the city’s fall crueller than this?\n\nI place Ascanius, and my father Anchises, and the gods of Troy,\n\nin my companions’ care, and conceal them in a winding valley:\n\nI myself seek the city once more, and take up my shining armour.\n\nI’m determined to incur every risk again, and retrace\n\nall Troy, and once more expose my life to danger.\n\nFirst I look for the wall, and the dark threshold of the gate\n\nfrom which my path led, and I retrace the landmarks\n\nof my course in the night, scanning them with my eye.\n\nEverywhere the terror in my heart, and the silence itself,\n\ndismay me. Then I take myself homewards, in case\n\nby chance, by some chance, she has made her way there.\n\nThe Greeks have invaded, and occupied, the whole house.\n\nSuddenly eager fire, rolls over the rooftop, in the wind:\n\nthe flames take hold, the blaze rages to the heavens.\n\nI pass by and see again Priam’s palace and the citadel.\n\nNow Phoenix, and fatal Ulysses, the chosen guards, watch over\n\nthe spoils, in the empty courts of Juno’s sanctuary.\n\nHere the Trojan treasures are gathered from every part,\n\nripped from the blazing shrines, tables of the gods,\n\nsolid gold bowls, and plundered robes.\n\nMothers and trembling sons stand round in long ranks.\n\nI even dared to hurl my shouts through the shadows,\n\nfilling the streets with my clamour, and in my misery,\n\nredoubling my useless cries, again and again.\n\nSearching, and raging endlessly among the city roofs,\n\nthe unhappy ghost and true shadow of Creusa\n\nappeared before my eyes, in a form greater than I’d known.\n\nI was dumbfounded, my hair stood on end, and my voice\n\nstuck in my throat. Then she spoke and with these words\n\nmitigated my distress: “Oh sweet husband, what use is it\n\nto indulge in such mad grief? This has not happened\n\nwithout the divine will: neither its laws nor the ruler\n\nof great Olympus let you take Creusa with you,\n\naway from here. Yours is long exile, you must plough\n\na vast reach of sea: and you will come to Hesperia’s land,\n\nwhere Lydian Tiber flows in gentle course among the farmers’\n\nrich fields. There, happiness, kingship and a royal wife\n\nwill be yours. Banish these tears for your beloved Creusa.\n\nI, a Trojan woman, and daughter-in-law to divine Venus,\n\nshall never see the noble halls of the Dolopians,\n\nor Myrmidons, or go as slave to some Greek wife:\n\ninstead the great mother of the gods keeps me on this shore.\n\nNow farewell, and preserve your love for the son we share.”\n\nWhen she had spoken these words, leaving me weeping\n\nand wanting to say so many things, she faded into thin air.\n\nThree times I tried to throw my arms about her neck:\n\nthree times her form fled my hands, clasped in vain,\n\nlike the light breeze, most of all like a winged dream.\n\nSo at last when night was done, I returned to my friends.\n\nBkII:796-804 Aeneas Leaves Troy\n\nAnd here, amazed, I found that a great number of new\n\ncompanions had streamed in, women and men,\n\na crowd gathering for exile, a wretched throng.\n\nThey had come from all sides, ready, with courage and wealth,\n\nfor whatever land I wished to lead them to, across the seas.\n\nAnd now Lucifer was rising above the heights of Ida,\n\nbringing the dawn, and the Greeks held the barricaded\n\nentrances to the gates, nor was there any hope of rescue.\n\nI desisted, and, carrying my father, took to the hills."
