Formed in 1989, Slowdive rose to prominence during the heyday of the shoegaze movement alongside bands like My Bloody Valentine and Ride. The band, consisting of Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell, Christian Savill, Nick Chaplin, and Simon Scott, crafted a dreamy, ethereal sound characterised by lush, swirling guitars and hazy vocals.

Slowdive gained critical acclaim with their early releases, including the seminal albums "Just for a Day" (1991) and "Souvlaki" (1993). Tracks like "Alison" and "When the Sun Hits" became anthems for fans of the genre, establishing Slowdive as one of shoegaze's most influential acts.

After releasing three albums, Slowdive disbanded in 1995, with members pursuing various musical projects. The band's influence endured, however, and in 2014, Slowdive surprised fans by announcing their reunion. The subsequent release of their fourth studio album, the self-titled "Slowdive" in 2017, marked a triumphant return to form.

Excitement is building as Slowdive prepares to embark on a UK tour from 16 February to 27 February 2024. The tour will see them perform in cities across the country, treating fans to a live experience that captures the essence of their atmospheric soundscapes and mesmerizing performances.

This eagerly anticipated tour is not only a celebration of Slowdive's enduring legacy but also a chance for a new generation of music lovers to witness the band's sonic magic live on stage. From the intimate venues to the larger arenas, the tour promises to deliver an immersive and unforgettable experience for fans of shoegaze and alternative music.
