I like your top three.\n\nI like the related My Bloody Valentine too, but I just find Slowdive a tad bit better to be honest, there's more \"dreaminess\" in their songs I think... still, I like them too...\n\nDeleted\n\nDeleted Member\n\nPosts: 0\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nHere are some SUPERB live performances from the post-reunion tour.\n\nI need to see them live as they're insanely good. Man, what a band.\n\nIndeed my friend, indeed. Such a shame they didn't get the recognition they actually deserved. Those reverbs, that dense kinda guitar work...it transports you to another world...just beautiful! Alan Mcgee really had a good eye for amazing artists.\n\ncarlober\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nMake Shoegaze great again\n\nPosts: 7,948\n\nPost by carlober on\n\nNot really Slowdive-related, but this band (and this song in particular) reminds me of them A LOT, it would perfectly fit on Souvlaki. It's almost like you're hearing Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell singing, it is that close!\n\nAlso, they have a new album out in two weeks so you might check them out if you like this track.\n\ncarlober\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nMake Shoegaze great again\n\nPosts: 7,948\n\nPost by carlober on\n\nThe new single is called Star Roving and it's the first song released by the band in 22 years!\n\nI really enjoy it, although it's not what I expected. It's very fast-paced and it reminds me a bit of Ride\n\nI would have liked to hear Rachel's vocals less buried in the mix though.\n\nglider\n\nOasis Manager\n\nThrowing stones from the stars on your mixed up world\n\nPosts: 6,129\n\nPost by glider on\n\nConfession: I still haven't gave Pygmalion a proper listen yet!

I'll listen to the new single afterwards.\n\nPygmalion... some people love it, others hate it with a passion.\n\nI don't hate it but I'm not the biggest fan of it either. It's very different from Souvlaki, it's not a bad listen but it lacks some soul imho.\n\nEDIT: J's Heaven is amazing though. Hauntingly beautiful.\n\nDeleted\n\nDeleted Member\n\nPosts: 0\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAfter 22 years, Slowdive return with \"Star Roving\", their first new material since 1995’s 'Pygmalion', which will be released via Dead Oceans, worldwide. The band has been hinting at new music for some time and now the band can finally satisfy the ears of their patient fans. Featuring Neil Halstead (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Christian Savill (guitar), Nick Chaplin (bass), Rachel Goswell (vocals) and Simon Scott (drums, electronics), \"Star Roving\" embodies the effortlessness for which Slowdive is known -- as the song progresses, it expands and contracts in ways that feel infinite. Singer Neil Halstead says: “When the band decided to get back together in 2014 we really wanted to make new music. It's taken us a whole load of shows and a few false starts to get to that point, but it's with pride and a certain trepidation we unleash “Star Roving”. We really hope folks enjoy it, it's part of a bunch of new tracks we've been working on and it feels as fun, and as relevant playing together now as it did when we first started”.\n\nglider\n\nOasis Manager\n\nThrowing stones from the stars on your mixed up world\n\nPosts: 6,129\n\nPost by glider on\n\nCouldn't help myself so went ahead and took a quick listen. It's a good comeback track, but there is some issues I have.\n\n1. Feels rushed with that tempo - very dance/rave like sound to it that caught me off guard.\n\n2. Abit too much on the pop side rather than the space rock or ambient side of the spectrum.\n\n3. Not much else interesting going on in the track except the expected hazy distorted guitar pile up of overdubs. Vocals kind of seem pointless and don't add much.\n\nIt's a 'fun' track to listen to and get you moving but I did want something darker and more introspective. Hoping we get that on 'Dead Oceans' (which is a terrific LP title).\n\ncarlober\n\nGlobal Moderator\n\nMake Shoegaze great again\n\nPosts: 7,948\n\nPost by carlober on\n\nCouldn't help myself so went ahead and took a quick listen.

Its slightly poppy qualities have attracted praise from an unexpected large amount of people. I'd never seen Slowdive (or any shoegaze act) mentioned on mainstream \"rock\" websites before, not here in Italy at least.\n\nAlso, 'Dead Oceans' would make a fantastic album title but I believe it's only the name of the record label\n\nI'm digging the fast pace of Star Roving though, it reminds me of some of the excellent Slowdive lost demos like Joy and Beach:"
