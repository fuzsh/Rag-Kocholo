        "text": "Here’s an admission: shoegaze is still one of my favorite genres. The gauzy dream-sound of guitars blurred into pure haze.. it’s never left that soft, nostalgic center of my brain. Effects pedals, ghosted vocals, and a sort of spectral swagger will always their place in my heart.\n\nToday I listened to Slowdive‘s monumental second album, Souvlaki, and it all came flooding back. I got those old familiar chills right in the middle:\n\nHere She Comes is the simplest, most direct song on the album. The impressionistic lyrics are just dark and weird enough to not seem juvenile; combined with the melodic cloud of hand drums and reverb-laden guitar, they form a surreal love poem.\n\nIt’s so lonely in this place\n\nSo cold I don’t believe\n\nAnd as no-one knows my name\n\nIt’s easy to pretend\n\nIt’s easy to believe\n\nThere’s a shadow on my wall\n\nIt dances like my soul\n\nDances like my soul\n\nIt’s so cold now\n\nI swear it will be warm\n\nHere she come now\n\nSince the band recently reformed, I’m hoping for at least one chance to see Slowdive perform in this lifetime.\n\nSomeone was kind enough to upload the entire Souvlaki album on youtube, so give it a listen if you don’t already own it. As one of the best albums of the 90s, and easily one of two or three crowning achievements of the shoegaze genre, it’d be a damn shame to miss out on this experience. Buy the album for less than $10, if you’re interested. Or listen first below.\n\nThere’s a shadow on my wall / It dances like my soul"
