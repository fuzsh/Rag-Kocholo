        "text": "Neil Halstead speaks to me over the phone from Cologne, where Slowdive are currently on tour. It’s been a busy few months – they’ve just returned from South America, where they played Argentina, Chile and Brazil – so it’s been a while since the frontman has spent any substantial time in Newquay, the Cornish town he’s called home since 1994.\n\n‘It used to be just a little sleepy surf town that would get busy in the summer; a lot of families would come down for holidays,’ he says. ‘Now, it’s changed a bit. There’s lots of nice coffee shops and many different surf schools. In some ways I miss when it was a little less gentrified. But it’s still a lovely place.’ Neil recommends visiting in September or April, when the surf and weather is good but the crowds are at bay. Here are his top things to do.\n\nEat\n\n‘Pachanga is quite close to where I live. They do simple Mexican food, like huevos rancheros for breakfast. The couple who run it used to have a food truck parked up in town and they finally got their own spot. If you want fancy food there’s a place called Verbena, from chefs Adam Banks and Mariana Chaves, which does small plates. If you’re feeling a little bit flush, it’s a good place to go.’\n\nDrink\n\n‘The Red Lion is the most traditional pub still in Newquay. It overlooks the harbour and they do a good quiz night on Tuesdays. It’s always busy. The pubs in Newquay close at about 11, but there’s a bunch of clubs that are open until two or three in the morning. In summer, it gets pretty hectic.’\n\nSee\n\n‘Newquay harbour is the jewel in the crown of Newquay. It’s really beautiful and a great place to hang out. It doesn’t get too busy, there’s a nice little little restaurant down there and you can pick up lobsters and fish from fishermen down there if you want to do your own thing.’\n\nDo\n\n‘It’s all about the outdoors and going for a surf. There’s Olla Hiki Sauna, which is a mobile sauna based up on Fistral beach at the moment. So you can go for a sauna and then for a dip in the sea.’\n\nSlowdive’s UK tour is happening now until February 27. Find out more here."
