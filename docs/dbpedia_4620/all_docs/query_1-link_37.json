        "text": "It was fortunate Slowdive decided to tour again after all these years. Now that I’ve seen them, I can hardly imagine I might never have had the experience.\n\nWhite noise. Dream pop. All the clichés and over-used terms apply. Yet, Slowdive have serious real estate here. This is their turf, and they showed exactly why a “shoegaze” internet search turns up their name behind only one other. The bright, noisy bliss of “Morningrise,” “Catch the Breeze,” and “Souvlaki Space Station” threatened to overtake the venue, often sounding like something between massive beauty and high-pitched screaming. Slower tunes like “Dagger” and “Rutti” gave the senses a break but were just as engaging. And with “Blue Skied an’ Clear,” a trippy dirge drenched in equal parts melancholy and radiance, one might think this is how it sounds when an angel dies.\n\nShoegazers can, and do, rock out. Make no mistake about that. However Slowdive create their sound in the studio, they brought it with them to the stage - only on a grander scale with more echo, more reverb, more noise, and more bliss. Their sound was often heavy, but it nonetheless washed into every corner of the venue. Psychedelic lights only suggested that nobody should have come sober. The whole experience was like noisy, gorgeous fireworks that exploded and then dripped down the walls.\n\nThrough all this, the band acted as if they were doing nothing extraordinary. No bravado – just cool confidence. Yet, for a band that was so derided back in the day, Slowdive should have had nothing but “we told you so” looks on their faces. With their return to the stage, apologies from the British press (and any other naysayers) should reverb longer and louder than “Golden Hair.” I hope, behind their stoicism, Slowdive know how important they are.\n\nLoud lights and bright noise, swirls of color and washes of sound. It was a psychedelic assault for a now grown-up generation with kids, mortgages, and other problems of their own. How nice to forget all that … just for a day.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nHaving been a big a fan since the \"first time round\" in the early 90s it was really exciting news to hear Slowdive were reforming in early 2014. I was lucky enough to see them three times in 2014: at the first show (discounting the Sonic Cathedral \"pre-show\") at Village Underground in May, at Latitude and an amazing performance at the Forum in December (slightly spoiled by too many shouty drunken idiots).\n\nThe sound is amazing as always, and live you can really hear the influence they had, for example on post-rock bands like Mogwai and Sigur Ros. They played tracks from all three (quite different) albums, including Pygmalion, more of a electronic/post-rock album based around samples and loops but managed to bring more of a band sound to them. For the most part the set focuses on the early EPs (which captures them much better at the early stage of their career than the first LP IMO), Souvlaki and a couple of tracks from Pygmalion (Crazy for You, Blue Skied An' Clear and occasionally Rutti).\n\nIt's been really satisfying seeing Slowdive get the respect they deserve at last (I remember their mauling at the hands of the music press in the mid 90s). Given the strength of their performances, Halstead's recent work with Black Hearted Brother and Simon Scott's ambient electronica albums, the new album is something to look forward to in 2015.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIt’s a vintage time for the reunited shoegaze band. While My Bloody Valentine and Loop have recently reconvened to pummel the ears of audiences worldwide in to rapturous submission, particular excitement has been reserved for the return of another of the genre’s leading lights, the Thames Valley quintet Slowdive. While their aforementioned contemporaries straddled a fine line between cacophony and beauty, Slowdive remain more concerned with a strange sort of transcendental prettiness than anything aggressive, and the effect is nothings shot of mesmerising. A recent set at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound festival proved a particularly idyllic setting - watching songs such as \"Crack The Breeze\" and \"Souvlaki Space Station\" waft out over the Catalonian coast had me wondering whether they were written particularly with that setting in mind – and it certainly was not the sound of a band who haven’t played live in twenty odd years. It’s not so much that the songs have aged well – it’s that the material barely seems to have aged a day. The weight of their influence on bands like Mogwai and The Twilight Sad was clear and present, and with rumours of potential new material appearing at some stage, one wouldn’t bet against them returning to find themselves still a fair distance ahead of the younger, chasing pack.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIt's 20 years since I last saw Slowdive in concert so I was really looking forward to seeing them live. I was seeing them at the Forum in Kentish Town where I saw them for the penultimate time supporting Ride on their \"Unfamiliar\" tour.\n\nI saw them a couple of years later at the Grand in Clapham, I think it was a tour with the Cranes?\n\nAnyway they've reformed and I got to see them and they were outstanding. Highlights for me were Catch the Breeze, She Calls, When the Sun Hits and Golden Hair which finished with strobes flashing, feedback squealing guitars and ringing ears.\n\nHere's the setlist:\n\nSlowdive\n\nAvalyn\n\nCatch the breeze\n\nCrazy for you\n\nMachine Gun\n\nSouvlaki space station\n\nBlue sky clear\n\nWhen the sun hits\n\nMorningrise\n\nShe calls\n\nDagger\n\nAlison\n\nGolden hair\n\nAlbatross\n\n40 days\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nOkay... So this is actually my first time seeing any shoegaze band live... But from what I have seen about other major shoegaze bands on the Internet I can guarantee that Slowdive is a first-rate watch. Everything from the playing to the lighting were done impeccably and to the taste. Rachel and Niel were excellent performers, but I must own that my favourite musician of the group was Nick the bassist. The man's entirely of his own world and class. When he's on stage he's so drowned in his own playing it's as if no shit of this world can ever touch him. I also had a quick exchange with the band after they came off the stage. All five of them were nice and interesting to talk to, especially Rachel. Anyway, I guess I now consider myself a total \"Slowdivemaniac\", if there ever is such a word.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
