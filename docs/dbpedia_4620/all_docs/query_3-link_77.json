        "text": "SLOWDIVE - October 14th, 2023. Live @ The Bellwether. Downtown Los Angeles, California.\n\nShoegaze & alternative fans galore filled up & sold-out the brand new, 1600-capacity Bellwether concert venue in Downtown Los Angeles, which was just newly opened to the public this past July.\n\nTheir opening act, Drab Majesty, had a very mellow approach to start off the night. With a combination of synthesizers & a guitar, their set had elements of darkwave, goth-rock, synthwave, industrial, & dark ambient music all wrapped into one. Dressed in blonde wigs, chrome face paint, & suits, their stage presence matched their sound - which was something you wouldn't have expected, but immediately got on board with after their first few songs. Wonderful opener in my opinion!\n\nNext up, the act everyone had been longing to see - SLOWDIVE! Members Rachel Goswell, Nick Chaplin, Neil Halstead, Christian Savill, & Simon Scott entered the stage with a soft, synth track welcoming them, along with a sea of 1600 screaming fans, to the stage.\n\nOpening up the set with a track off their latest album “everything is alive” (released September 1st, 2023) was a song titled “shanty” - which the fans immediately embraced and adored. For a band that’s been around for 34 years, they have not missed a step, sound-wise.\n\nBetween the whirrs & whistling of guitar pedals, the wooing sound of the whammy bars, crystallized-sounding synths, the bass beating in your chest, the drum kit pulsating your entire body, & soft, angelic vocals from both Rachel Goswell & Neil Halstead, before a blaze of fire which was the guitars sending everyone into a psychedelic frenzy, this show was a DREAM come true for myself & many other fans.\n\nThe visuals as well were breathtaking, with a combination of flashing strobe lights, a hypnotic black & white spiral, yellow & red lights that would shimmer to the beat of their songs, soft blue light that would sparkle with each guitar note, & much more. The production team brought their A-game, as it was a fully immersive, eccentric experience.\n\nYou could feel the love in The Bellwether that night, which many sharing a kiss or raising their drinks to one another. So many arms around one another, hands being held, hugs given, cheers & tears of excitement. A majority of those in attendance were emotionally affected by the array of beauty which was the soundtrack of Slowdive, & all the memories, good, bad, or indifferent, they’ve unintentionally played in many of our lives.\n\nAfter a very emotional 12-song setlist, including hits off their albums “Just For A Day”, “Self Titled”, & of course “Souvlaki”, upon many more (& their set even featured a cover of Syd Barrett’s “Golden Hair”), they yet again struck a nerve in all of our emotions with a 4-song encore. Closing out the set with one of their most popular, yet underrated songs (in my opinion), “40 Days” off of their critically-acclaimed album “Souvlaki”. This show was a masterpiece from start to finish, & a night i’m sure all 1600+ in attendance shall never forget. Slowdive has done nothing but DELIVERED in their 34-year career as a band, & worth every dollar spent to experience them live. You will not regret it.\n\nReview Written by Bradley Verkaik\n\n(@flacowannabe)"
