        "text": "Formed in 1989, the British dreampop band Slowdive explore a new alternative genre of rock. They’ve had years of fame, and this year’s September release of Everything is Alive released is even more special. The Slowdive members emotionally connect with their music greatly, and the 41 minute and 42 seconds of this album were filled with lyricism surrounding escape from loss and grief and finding lightness and peacefulness in life.\n\nSongwriter Neil Halstead and guitarist for the band along with, guitarist Rachel Goswell, bassist Nick Chaplin and guitarist Christian Savill suffered the loss of Rachel Goswell’s mother and Simon Scott’s father in the past couple years. Neil Halstead, who wrote all the album’s songs, said that the music was more of an “escape” from the darkness that the band’s members were going through.\n\nWith such darkness and sadness surrounding the album’s history, listeners expected a slow sounding or depressing tone in the songs, but the songs combined to be a beautiful emotional experience. The song “Andalucia Plays” has a beautiful outlook on loss: “You are my angel, wearing your favorite shirt, French cloth and polka dot, Andalucia plays on the stereo, I dream like a butterfly, perfect and temporary.” The phrase, “I dream like a butterfly” is very detailed. Butterflies are greatly related to transformation, growth and freedom; and as we hear this in the song, it paints a picture of using those memories to grow as a person and free yourself from the negative feelings of grief.\n\nThe album’s lyrics do however get a bit repetitive, but I find repetitive lyrics to be quite emotional; however, some may find it boring. The song “Alife” uses the repetitive lyrics of “two lives are hard lives with you,” to prove a point of having to live on with life after a big loss. Two lives, one before that person was gone and one after the fact, while that person is still with you emotionally and will never truly leave, both those metaphorical “lives” were filled with struggles.\n\nI found this album a bit repetitive and could only find myself mesmorized with the song “Kisses”. I absolutely loved the sound of this song and find that it could potentially be one of Slowdive’s best.\n\nThis calming detailed and affecting album hit the nail on the head on the themes of grief and Neil Halsteadand’s songwriting is a great fit for the sound of this band. However, many can agree Slowdive had better albums in the past that may affect any spotlights on their newly released albums especially now in the media. Overall, I would give this album 3/5 shields but greatly suggest any indie rock fans to listen."
