        "text": "The term \"shoegaze\" originates from a mockery of the rock subgenre’s artists, whose heavy use of effects pedals often caused them to look down at their shoes rather than engage with the crowd. A band synonymous with shoegaze, for both its sound and the origin of the term, is Slowdive.\n\nSince their formation in 1989, Slowdive has amassed a significant following and influenced modern darlings like Beach House. Their resurgence in popularity can be partly attributed to TikTok’s infamous shoegaze revival, where Slowdive features prominently. A quick glance at TikTok will show you “40 Days” playing to a clip of Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet frolicking around Montauk in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind amassing hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nTo see them for myself I went to Copenhagen. On the stage at Store Vega, Rachel Goswell, Neil Halstead, Christian Savill, Nick Chaplin, and Simon Scott gladly greeted the multi-generational audience that had been eagerly awaiting their return. The band kicked off the concert with their namesake track “Slowdive,” followed by “Star Roving” and “Catch the Breeze.”\n\nPurples, yellows, and greens lit the stage, with a hypnotic swirl of black-and-white patterns projected behind the band. The crowd’s metronomic sway made the outside world seem inconsequential. The concert reached its climax with the foggy guitars signaling the start of one of the band's most acclaimed songs, “When the Sun Hits.” Neil Halstead commanded the crowd, his voice intimate as a hushed conversation between two old friends, echoing the chorus, “It matters where you are.”\n\nAs arms raised and voices harmonized, the thesis of the performance became clear: despite their hiatus, the label dropping, and years spent apart, for Slowdive, what matters most is the present. They concluded with “Golden Hair,” a Syd Barrett cover rendered poignantly melancholy. Yet, just before the lights signaled the end, the band returned for an encore, playing “Dagger,” “Sugar for the Pill,” and “The Slab.”\n\nThe encore felt more meaningful than most. It was as if the band, devoted and appreciative, was saying, “Not now, not yet.” While their direct interaction with the crowd was sparse, their music spoke volumes, with a diverse setlist showing gratitude to both new and old fans.\n\nThe concert’s conclusion left me unsurprised at the younger generation's love for Slowdive’s older sound. The band members were teenagers themselves when they wrote these songs. Maybe this is why there is something inherently empathetic about Slowdive, as they acknowledge the brutality of growing pains while reassuring listeners that their feelings are not unique. Their popularity proves that while loneliness and angst are deeply personal, they are universally understood."
