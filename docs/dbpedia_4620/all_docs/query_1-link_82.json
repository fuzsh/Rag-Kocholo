        "text": "We believe that music is a universal language that unites all of us and brings people from all walks of life together. We thrive on making people happy from the time we open our doors to the last note of the concert.\n\nWe believe whatever your religion, race, culture, education, gender, ability or disability, that everyone should be able to enjoy music as equally as is reasonably possible and plausible.\n\nWe strongly believe that if we do everything we can to treat everyone as we ourselves would wish to be treated, we can succeed in our efforts to “turn everyone on” to the magic of the live music experience. That said, everyone’s case is individual and each venue and show has its own unique challenge. We encourage you to reach out to us directly to purchase tickets and make requests for special accommodations or needs for any event at any venue we present. We will do our very best to accommodate you with an ease of service that will exceed all expectations.\n\nAccessible tickets are available for all events that Another Planet Entertainment presents. To purchase accessible tickets, click on the “Request Accessible Tickets” icon on the respective Ticketmaster event page."
