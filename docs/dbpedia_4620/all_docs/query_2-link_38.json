        "text": "Today I wanna talk about an interesting genre called shoegaze. I must be honest at first, I am not an expert of this, so if anything sounds not right please do let me know.\n\nShoegaze is a special genre emerging from England in late 1980. It’s kind of a genre that continuingly influences post-rock. The difference between these two.. I personally believe Shoegaze still falls more within the traditional frame of rock music, but post-rock is more freely composed, and the experimental spirit is stronger.\n\nAnyway, I believe wiki will solve more profound questions which you may have and I cannot answer. At this moment I am more into introducing the way that I enjoy Shoegaze.\n\nAs a heavy listener to rock music, Shoegaze was not really in my playlist until recent moment because I need some calm vibes. The first group I tried was actually My Bloody Valentine, and yes because they are called classic. In general they are good, and very dreaming and still emo. I think if I were 10 years younger I would fall in love with them. And now I am happy to listen to Slowdive, which honestly speaking, not dramatically different from other Shoegaze bands, but I think I somehow enjoy their restraint.\n\nSlomo is a relatively new song (2017), but still tells a good story. The way they blurred the clear vocal and instrumental is intriguing. Sometimes I feel like dream pop is a way to echo your voice in the brain and repetitively make you believe whatever your brain says is your heart says. I think this song is quite a straightforward one, expressing the longing for love and seeking tenderness. The way Slomo addresses the universal emotions is nothing dramatically different but quite convincing.\n\nI suggest Shoegaze is a good way to immerse oneself into a specific emotional moment and want to stay there a bit longer. When this world’s reality is difficult to be embraced, take an hour to listen to this type of music may be a good escape."
