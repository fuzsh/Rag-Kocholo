        "text": "(Creation, 1995) could not be more unusual in the season of Brit-pop. De facto, it is a solo album by Neil Halstead who gives vent to his environmental lusts, halfway between Talk Talk (the ten minutes of Rutti) and Seefeel ( Miranda, Trellisaze, J's Heaven). The classic Slowdive sound is still lingering in the mantra of Crazy For You and in the vortex of Blue Skied An' Clear. But the band is by now dead. (Original text by Piero Scaruffi) (Clicka qua per la versione Italiana)\n\nAfter Slowdive disbanded, Halstead and Goswell launched Mojave 3. Immune from guitar distortions, Ask Me Tomorrow (4AD, 1996) has a gently, dreamy, melancholic folk tone, akin to the Cowboy Junkies, even if the Slowdive touch is easily recognizable (a few of the songs are brainchildren of Dagger and Miranda) and lead-off ballad Love Songs On The Radio was clearly inspired by Mazzy Star's Fade Into You.\n\nA country twang accompanies Goswell's languid and suave meditation Tomorrow's Taken. Guitar, piano and soft drumming accent the evanescent melody of Sarah.\n\nMelodies are always romantically engaging, although never sumptuous or emphatic. Quite the contrary: the duets Candle Song 3 and Where Is The Love belong with the tender lullabies of Leonard Cohen; and You're Beautiful is a serenade sung with the quiet tone (and sparse arrangement) of early Donovan.\n\nThe band relaxes a little too much on Out Of Tune (4AD, 1998), a subdued collection that harks back to the late 1960s country and folk revivals and that relates even too explicitly to the icons of that time: Gram Parson (Give What You Take, Baby's Coming Home), Band (Keep It All Hid, Caught Beneath Your Heel), Nick Drake (All Your Tears, Yer Feet), and, last but not least, Bob Dylan, who inspires the two singles (Who Do You Love, Some Kinda Angel).\n\nWhile not as accomplished as the debut album, and still prone to fainting at every note like the sophomore album, Excuses For Travellers (4AD, 2000) clarifies Mojave 3's identity, as modern singer-songwriter's music that harks back to the golden age of country-rock and folk-rock but adds a metaphysical dimension. Surprisingly, little is left of their psychedelic roots. The six-minute ode In Love With A View recalls the magic atmosphere of Bob Dylan's Blonde On Blonde, and She Broke You So Softly has the gentle, pure, loving quality of the first Donovan album. The seven-minute My Life In Art is all about whispering emotions to a bird on a wire, inspired by Leonard Cohen and Tim Buckley. The charming singalongs of When You're Drifting and Prayer For The Paranoid are concentrates of gentle gestures that bridge earth and heavens. Mojave 3 have achieved a classical style, that allows them to stretch the format of their ballads without renouncing a relatively simply format.\n\nThe spiritual undercurrent of much of the collection comes to light when trumpet and organ elevate Got My Sunshine to a moving gospel hymn full of hope and humility.\n\nThese are folk and country ballads that a lacerating pain has emptied of all energy and filled with a zen-like acceptance of the mystery of life. These are disciples of Gram Parsons, not of shoegazers.\n\nOn the other hand, the lively Return To Sender, the catchy and relaxed Krazy Kat, the modern arrangements of Bringin' Me Home (a touch of electronic, a danceable beat, a female voice), the power-pop of Anyday Will be Fine (reminiscent of Luna) could mark the beginning of a new career (or several new careers).\n\nNeil Halstead's first solo album, Sleeping On Roads (4AD, 2001), sounded like an electronic version of Paul Simon and Bob Dylan. A couple of atmospheric tunes (Two Stones In My Pocket, See You On Rooftops) stand out among several plain, humorless dirges.\n\nSlowdive guitarist Christian Savill and Sean Hewson formed the project Monster Movie, that recorded the album Last Night Something Happened (Clairecords, 2002). The duo updates dream-pop to slo-core and ambient music. A few of the songs (4th and Pine, Waiting Shortwave, Home) are worth the best of the genre, and the instrumental pieces (First Trip to the City, Star City) exhude metaphysical dejection. Monster Movie then released To the Moon (2004), All Lost (2006) and Everyone Is a Ghost (2010).\n\nSpoon and Rafter (Matador, 2003), Mojave 3's fourth album, fails to introduce new elements, but succeeds in extending the ethereal vision of the musicians. The nine-minute Bluebird Of Happiness, the brooding Between the Bars and the graceful folk-pop lullabies Tinkers Blues and She's All Up Above show how Halstead's dexterity at just about any mood and form.\n\nRachel Goswell's first solo album, Waves Are Universal (4AD, 2004), is a graceful exercise in recreating the mood of early Cocteau Twins and, yes, Slowdive.\n\nMojave 3's Puzzles Like You (4AD, 2006) was their most extroverted work yet, as close as Halstead ever got to writing bouncy pop ditties, as if he had decided to release a tribute album to the 1960s (Truck Driving Man, Big Star Baby).\n\nNeil Halstead's second solo album, Oh! Mighty Engine (2008) was an acoustic bedroom exercise.\n\nSlowdive's drummer Simon Scott debuted solo with the ethereal Navigare (Miasmah, 2009) and the four-song EP Traba (Immune, 2010). Scott instead opted for brainy constructions and a noir-jazz atmosphere on Bunny (Miasmah, 2011)."
