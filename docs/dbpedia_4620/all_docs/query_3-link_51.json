        "text": "Integrity, honesty, and upholding our reputation are paramount to us. Over the past decade, we have been able to work with more than 400 world famous musicians. There is no way we would have been able to make it in the music industry without a sterling track record of honesty and transparency.\n\nSince we started this project over 10 years ago, every single one of our pieces has been hand signed by the associated artist, unless otherwise stated. We also include a Certificate of Authenticity with each print to certify they are hand-signed.\n\nYes! We donate on average $1M to charity each year. The profits from each print go directly to the non-profit listed on its product page. We mostly focus our fundraising on a few key areas: refugee rights, environmental stewardship, social and racial equality, mental health, music education, and disaster relief.\n\nEach signed print measures 24″ x 24″ and is hand signed by the musician. They are part of a larger run of prints, typically with 50-100 copies signed in total. Our unsigned prints, which come in a standard and a mini size, feature the same design as the signed print, but do not have the musician's autograph. They are still limited edition and are signed by Soundwaves Art creator, Tim Wakefield.\n\nOur Originals measure 38″ x 38″ and often feature a lyric or the title of the song written by the artist in addition to their signature. These are much more limited edition – there is only one Original created per design. Originals sometimes come in alternate color palettes or wave designs to the prints.\n\nAfter many years of partnering with third-party framers, we are very excited to be bringing framing in-house as part of our brand new Soundwaves Art Framing program! Between our team, we have over 20 years of experience in framing and maintain the highest of standards for our work. As we ramp up our framing capacity and give each frame the attention it deserves, we're expecting orders with framing to take an additional 4 weeks to be completed."
