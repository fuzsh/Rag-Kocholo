        "text": "British shoegazers Slowdive unleashed a dense and sprawling new song, “Star Roving,” their first in 22 years.\n\nThe expansive dream-pop cut boasts layers of guitars drenched in reverb and chorus while a splashy and swift drum beat surges beneath. Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell’s dual vocals, meanwhile, simmer in between.\n\n“Star Roving” marks Slowdive’s first new material since 1995’s Pygmalion album. The group is at work on a new LP that will be released through Dead Oceans, though a release date and title have yet to be announced.\n\nTrending\n\nSlowdive reunited in 2014 for a handful of live shows, though Halstead said the group’s intention was always to make new music. “It’s taken us a whole load of shows and a few false starts to get to that point, but it’s with pride and a certain trepidation we unleash Star Roving,'” he said in a statement. “It’s part of a bunch of new tracks we’ve been working on and it feels as fun, and as relevant playing together now as it did when we first started.”"
