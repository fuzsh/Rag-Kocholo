        "text": "The role drummer Ian McCutcheon played within the band Slowdive was a rather unique one. Joining the band in early 1994 after the departure of drummer Simon Scott, he would soon be thrown into the band’s chaotic 1994 North American tour, a tour that would ultimately be their last for two decades. He served as the drummer for the group’s 1995 album Pygmalion, a record which saw Slowdive ditch their shoegaze sound and move towards a more post-rock style. Following the band’s split, Ian would become one of the founding members of Mojave 3 along fellow Slowdive members Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell. In 2004 he formed his own band, The Loose Salute while continuing to collaborate with artists like Simon Rowe and groups like The Soft Cavalry.\n\nWhere did your interest in drumming first come from?\n\nMy grand-dad was a drummer. I never got to see him play sadly and I only got to sit with him behind the kit once when I was young. He would always talk about his time drumming though, and my mom would tell me about him being a drummer. I guess I became a drummer because of him.\n\nWhat was your first exposure to the “shoegaze” genre?\n\nThat would probably be from my brother taking me to gigs. I remember seeing Ride performing at the Kilburn National when I was 19. This would have been in 1991. I came away from that gig changed, especially as a drummer. With shoegaze, it’s one thing when it’s recorded in the studio, and a completely different ball game live. Ride were spectacular live, and still are.\n\nHow did you end up joining Slowdive?\n\nI went to see Slowdive play at the Garage, which was a venue in London in 1993. I had a friend who knew Neil and Rachel who I went along with. After the show, Rachel and I talked and she asked me how I liked the show. I thought it was great but I felt that the drummer didn’t seem to be into it. Apparently, that was the last gig that Simon Scott, their drummer, did before he quit the band. She later talked to Neil about it, and since they knew I was a drummer, thought that I’d be a good fit. I ended up meeting Neil and did a few rehearsals with him. I’m nowhere near as good as Simon, but I tried to play like the record as much as I could. Next thing I know, we were all going on tour in America. It was all very quick.\n\nWhat was the atmosphere in the band like on that North American tour? I know there were issues involving funding and label support.\n\nThe whole thing was touch and go if we were even going to make it out there. A couple of the guys in the band really pushed for it to happen. I was young and happy to be there, although I was very nervous at the gigs. Looking back, I guess there was already a little bit of a split showing. I didn’t want to take sides because I was the new boy, but it probably was not the happiest band to be in at that moment.\n\nWhat was your experience recording Pygmalion and how much of the drumming on the album was done by you versus was programmed by Neil?\n\nI think I picked up that the vibe of Pygmalion was going to be more electronic early on, with us looping stuff rather than recording as a live band. I did sit and play drums over stuff with Neil, but we definitely sampled snare hits, toms, ride hits, and cymbals. It’s hard to sort it all out since a lot of it was all chopped up by. My playing on “Blue Skied an’ Clear” was done very softly with brushes, but the rest was all layered up.\n\nNeil has mentioned that Talk Talk were a huge influence on him during the recording of Pygmalion. Were you influenced by the sound of their drummer, Lee Harris, for that record?\n\nI had heard Spirit of Eden before, but it wasn’t a big album for me at the time. I just wanted to be a rock drummer, and I think the rest of the band just wanted to play loud guitar and loud bass. I guess Neil was moving towards something a bit different. It was hard for the rest of us to understand the record we were making at the time. It was especially hard for Nick and Christian, as they really didn’t know what was going on. Since I was the new boy, I was keen to just be there. I found it to be quite fun even though I really didn’t understand it at the time. Listening back to it now, I can hear what Neil was trying to make, but back then I was just wide-eyed and enthusiastic. I was just happy to be involved.\n\nHow soon after work on Pygmalion was complete did work begin on what would become Mojave 3’s debut record Ask Me Tomorrow?\n\nThe turnaround between those two albums was pretty quick. Slowdive had a few gigs booked and few rehearsals, but the attitude within the band was not good. Creation dropped the us and for Nick and Christian, that was the end until the reunion in 2014. Neil had a few tunes he had written and so the three of us went into this little EMI studio in London and laid down a few songs. I’d say it was within months of Slowdive ending.\n\nWas it a challenge to pivot from the more rock orientated drumming to the much more restrained and lighter feel of the first few Mojave 3 albums?\n\nNot for me. I was definitely into the whole Mojave 3 sound from the start. I was much more comfortable with that style of drumming to be honest. It can hard to tone stuff down and play simple. It’s the sort of player I am.\n\nMojave 3 toured the US in 1996 supporting fellow Shoegaze group Lush. What was your experience opening for them?\n\nLush were a lot of fun and we got along with them really well. I suppose it was the end of their journey, as it ended up being their last album. It was funny because they were getting more success with that record (1996’s Lovelife) than they had ever been before. We were playing quite big venues, which was great fun for us!\n\n“Bluebird of Happiness” marked a radical departure in Mojave 3’s sound, with the song drawing extensively on ambient elements. What was the story behind the making of the song?\n\n“Bluebird of Happiness” grew from the middle section. I was mucking around on the piano initially. I might have even been playing a Dennis Wilson song or something as a starting point. Neil took that and fleshed it out. The extended intro and outro were added later. It’s an odd song with the long passages, but the middle section came from that initial piano part.\n\nHow did Mojave 3 overcome the twin departures of guitarist Simon Rowe in 2004 and bassist/vocalist Rachel Goswell in 2006?\n\nWe were all sad to see Simon go, as we were all very close with him. We were on kind of a role at that point and were able to have a friend of ours, Joe Light, handle Simon’s guitar parts. Rachel’s departure was a much bigger loss, even though she hadn’t been singing a lot on the later Mojave 3 records. She was having troubles with her ear at the time. It seems crazy now to have even considered going on without Rachel considering how much impact she had on stage. I think we only did one tour and a few odd gigs after she left.\n\nHow did you end up producing the British indie-rock band Seafood?\n\nI’ve been friends with Kev (bassist/vocalist Kevin Hendrick) for a while now. Bizarrely, he’s now one of Slowdive’s guitar techs. I went to see him perform as part of Seafood in Camden. Afterwards, I told him I thought what he was doing was brilliant! I offered for him and the rest of the band to come down to Cornwall where we had small recording studio and record some demos. I really didn’t know what I was doing behind the desk, but we managed to get something down. They took it the label Fierce Panda and they ended up getting signed off of that demo.\n\nWhat made you want branch out and form The Loose Salute with Alan Forrester and your network of friends?\n\nThe Loose Salute came about because I had really gotten into songwriting. I just wanted to get these songs I had out there, so I put the band together and we started recording stuff.\n\nWas that also why you started taking up vocals?\n\nI had seen a friend of mine who also happens to be a drummer perform with his band around that time. Midway through the gig, he started singing while still playing drums. I found it really inspiring. I started singing a few songs while drumming and found it to be really enjoyable. In fact, I feel more comfortable now as a singer than I do playing drums. I’m actually just about done with my very first solo records, which I do all of the vocals on.\n\nIn 2011, Neil mentioned that Mojave 3 was working on new material. What ever became of that?\n\nIn 2011, Neil, Alan, myself and Simon got together and just jammed around for a bit. I think we had six or seven songs that we fleshed out together. At the time Neil was working on another project called Black Heart Brother. He was popping in and out of the session and was mixing the Black Heart Brother album when he wasn’t playing with us. I don’t know if he was totally into it. When Slowdive reunited, that became his main focus, and Mojave 3 was over.\n\nWas there any discussion of you rejoining Slowdive when they reunited in 2014?\n\nI was initially asked to be involved and got as far as the gigs coming in and set lists beginning to be discussed. Next thing I knew, I wasn’t. As you can imagine, it was not a great time for me. That being said, I understand why. Simon’s much more the mainstay drummer for them. He’s an amazing drummer and it just works with him there.\n\nAre there any future plans for Mojave 3?\n\nWe’ve been chatting with 4AD about reissuing the albums. I’m not sure when it’s going to happen, but I know it’ll be sometime soon, maybe even later this year. Right now, were just trying to schedule it all. I don’t think we’ll do anything new though. Slowdive is Neil and Rachel’s main focus now, so they really can’t do anything else at the moment.\n\nTell me about your new solo album?\n\nIt’s nearly finished, it’s being mixed right now. I wanted to make a more abstract album, something that flowed and didn’t have much structure but when i listen to it now it has transformed into more song like formations, I guess I can’t get away from that. It’s been a long process but a fun one and I’ve worked with some really beautiful people on it. It’s gentle and kind of smooth, it never really gets out of first gear, it’s a late night early morning record, something that just washes over you. Hopefully Nick Holton will put it out on his label Big Potato. He’s a great guy who also helped Simon Rowe put out his album. I’m hoping it’ll all drift off and hang around in time.\n\nWhat are your feelings about the “shoegaze” resurgence of the past few years.\n\nIt’s interesting isn’t it. I can’t say that I’m really into that style of music anymore beyond maybe Ride. I really don’t know what I feel about it. It’s certainly good for the bands. Shoegaze got a bit of kicking from the press back then, and no one likes bullies. I’d say it deserves its second chance. I’ve actually been following one of the newer bands called Beach House. I really like the stuff they’ve been putting out. I’ve also been keeping an eye on anything the label Sonic Cathedral releases. As for the older bands, I don’t know. Part of it feels like the nostalgia circuit.\n\nAre you still in contact with Neil, Rachel and the rest of the band?\n\nI live about three minutes away from Neil, so we see each other when he isn’t touring. Alan lives nearby as well. I was actually working with Rachel recently on a new Soft Cavalry album. Both me and Alan are playing on it, as is Christian from Slowdive. It’s always nice to see them and play again alongside Rachel."
