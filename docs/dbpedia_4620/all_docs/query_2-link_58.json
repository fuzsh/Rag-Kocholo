It was released in 1982 by record label Polydor as the first single from the band's fifth studio album, A Kiss in the Dreamhouse.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song (and the album) was representative of Siouxsie and the Banshees' more elaborate and experimental musical direction at the time. The overtones of the song were accentuated by a string section, including violins and a cello. AllMusic later described \"Slowdive\" as \"a violin-colored dance beat number\" with \"a catchy melodic hook\".[1][2] The Guardian's music critic Dave Simpson deemed it one of the band's very best recordings, noting that it \"sounds like the lid being slowly released on a pressure cooker, as the band emerge from the black and flit from suspense to sensuality. They change course again musically, too, switching from brooding rock to psychedelic pop\".[3] Rolling Stone noted the influence of German rock in the drums beats: \"Siouxsie hits the dance floor in \"Slowdive\", tapping into the krautrock power groove of bands like Can\".[4]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Slowdive\" was released on 1 October 1982 by record label Polydor. The song just missed becoming a top 40 hit, peaking at number 41 in the UK Singles Chart.[5]\n\nThe song's release on 12\" vinyl included an extended version (which would be released on the expanded, remastered edition of A Kiss in the Dreamhouse in 2009) and an instrumental version of the third track on Dreamhouse, \"Obsession\", titled \"Obsession II\".\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe title of the song inspired the name of the band Slowdive in the early 1990s, as later confirmed by the latter's members in interviews.[6][7]\n\n\"Slowdive\" was covered by LCD Soundsystem in January 2005 for an XFM radio session and was also released as the B-side of their \"Disco Infiltrator\" single. “Slowdive” was a consistent part of LCD Soundsystem's live set in 2005, serving as the show closer.[8][9]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n7\" single\n\n12\" single\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nSiouxsie and the Banshees\n\nSiouxsie Sioux – vocals\n\nSteven Severin – six-string bass guitar\n\nJohn McGeoch – guitar\n\nBudgie – drums, percussion, harmonica\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nAnne Stephenson – violin\n\nVirginia Hewes – violin"
