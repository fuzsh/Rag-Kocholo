        "text": "Introduction/History: After having released their very rushed debut, dream-pop/shoegaze band Slowdive returned to the studio in an attempt to record an album with a more professional and cleaned up sound. During this time, several things happened which affected the writing and recording process. Key band members Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell had ended their relationship causing Neil to quit the band and retreat into isolation where he would write a few tracks for the album. Ambient musician Brian Eno was brought in to work on production, but quit shortly afterwards due to tensions between him and the band. Eventually, despite all these setbacks the album was completed. Despite lukewarm reception at the time, the album has in more recent years been acclaimed as one of the greatest albums of the 90s, and a defining album in shoegaze music.\n\nPositive Stuff:\n\nA common theme running throughout this album is the idea of wanting to hang on to a relationship despite external forces causing each other to drift apart.\n\n“Dagger” describes a person who realized they unknowingly hurt their significant other post-breakup, and afterwards realizes their mistake.\n\nNegative Stuff:\n\n“Alison” is about a man who seeks consolation from a drug addicted woman. There’s also a reference to being high on “40 Days“\n\nOverview:\n\nWhen I first discovered this album, I thought it was very good, but it didn’t really hit me in the way that it did until the past week or so. This album is phenomenal. Sonically, its a vast whirlwind of dreamy, hazy, bliss that sounds more and more heavenly with each repeated listen. Compositionally its very melancholy and emotionally charged, but not to the point that it excessively wallows in depression like a lot of music from the 90s tends to do. Given the lyrics which consistently tackle dealing with heartbreak and the lingering feeling of still wanting to hold on to your ex, it really could have ended up sounding extremely dour and despondent. While yes, it is a rather downbeat and sad album, there is euphoria and pleasure in that sadness giving it almost a feeling of nostalgia which is fitting considering how often the lyrics involve one looking back at a past relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is a masterpiece. It perfectly captures the feeling of an emotional struggle perfectly through its ethereal soundscape and beautiful compositions. Highly recommended.\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nAge Appropriateness: 11 Years Old\n\nPG-13: some substance use"
