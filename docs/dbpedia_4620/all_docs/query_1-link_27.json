For the Siouxsie and the Banshees song, see Slowdive (song).\n\nSlowdive (stylized in lowercase) are an English rock band that formed in Reading, Berkshire, in 1989. The band consists of Rachel Goswell (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Neil Halstead (vocals, guitars), Christian Savill (guitars), Nick Chaplin (bass), and Simon Scott (drums, guitars, electronics), all of whom played on the band's early records. Halstead is the band's primary songwriter.\n\nTheir debut album Just for a Day (1991) and Souvlaki (1993) made the band one of the leading figures of the shoegaze scene, in the UK in the early 1990s. The group broke up soon after the release of their third studio album, Pygmalion, in 1995, having seen Scott, Savill and Chaplin depart the band prior. The remaining members continued under a more folk and country-influenced direction as Mojave 3."
