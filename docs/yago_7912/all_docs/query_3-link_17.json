She also entertained new generations of soldiers in Korea and Vietnam. The 5ft (1.55m) tall singer became known as the Sweetheart of the Fighting Fronts.\n\nHer trademark was I'm in the Mood for Love, written for her for the 1935 movie Every Night at Eight. Langford appeared in 30 Hollywood movies. She played herself in her final film, The Glenn Miller Story, in 1954.\n\nShe was also known for her role as the insufferable wife, Blanche, in the 1940s radio comedy, The Bickersons.\n\nShe said decades later that entertaining the troops \"was the greatest thing in my life.\"\n\nBorn in Lakeland in April 1914, Langford was discovered by bandleader Rudy Vallee. After the war, she met outboard motor heir Ralph Evinrude. They married in 1955 and moved to Jensen Beach.\n\nIn 1994, she married Harold Stuart, assistant secretary of the air force under President Truman."
