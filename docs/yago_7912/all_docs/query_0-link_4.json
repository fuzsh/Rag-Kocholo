Fights should lie dormant after they are fought, and won, or lost….\n\nBut I just can’t help myself…\n\nRecently my husband Ed and I received a postcard in the mail advertising Langford Landings’ Grand Opening on March 10th, 2018.\n\nIt made me so sad to see this card. It looked like an ad from Rooms to Go.\n\nI just don’t see how we as a county allowed such a tropical, historical piece of property to go to the “cookie cutter mill.”\n\nAlbeit the homes are expensive, pretty, and modern, they have no character of the original famed, Frances Langford Estate. None. Scraping all the trees off the land was the greatest sin, as these modern homes could look more tropical, more Frances Langfordish, if they had left some of the stately trees that she planted.\n\nYes, the developer “did not break any rules,” but we did, the Martin County Commission did. The rule broken? To show respect and honor to those who have walked before us. Especially, Mrs Langford.\n\nPhotos speak a thousand words.\n\nBelow are many from my mother, historian Sandra Thurlow, and Facebook friends, Bobbie Blodgett, and Rebecca Fatzinger. Local, Pop Delancy and others. People who shared with me as the property was be cleared and dismantled beginning in 2015…\n\nWell anyway. To broken records! “Long live the grace, beauty, and spirit of Mrs Frances Langford!” (I’ll Be Seeing You: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dok70bgFXHw)\n\n2015 Clearing as seen from Palmer Road and Present 2018 Post Card Sent Out Recently For Grand Opening of “Langford Landing,” the former Frances Langford Estate\n\nChose a floor-plan/home “Langford Landing” website 2018: https://www.meritagehomes.com/state/fl/south-florida/langford-landing#gref\n\nHistoric Photos Frances Langford Estate\n\nLangford Landing Website, Meritage Homes 2018: https://www.meritagehomes.com/state/fl/south-florida/langford-landing#gref\n\nEarlier post on subject: https://jacquithurlowlippisch.com/tag/the-former-frances-langford-estate/\n\nLangford’s Landing, Welcome to the New Martin County, SLR/IRL\n\nToday I am sharing photos taken yesterday, 2-8-17, by my husband, Ed, over Langford’s Landing, the controversial development along the once high bluff of the St Lucie River located on the northwest border of Sewall’s Point in Rio. Of course this property was the long time home of philanthropist, singer, and movie star, Frances Langford and years after her death, as she wished, those handling her estate put the monies from the sale of this land towards the trust in her name and legacy of giving. Whether the nature-loving long time Martin County resident would have approved of the conditions of the sale, we can only speculate…I know what I think.\n\nEven though the naked property remains visible from the bridges it is nice to see it close up. Thank you Ed for the photos!\n\nAs we can see, since December of 2015, all trees have been wiped out, the marina appears completed, the roads are in, the once historic high bluff is now flat and even, and few blades of grass are now visible.\n\nDevelopment full speed ahead!\n\nWelcome to the “new Martin County”…\n\nFormer blog on Langford Landing: (https://jacquithurlowlippisch.com/2016/01/21/scraped-and-pillaged-the-former-frances-langford-estate-slrirl/)\n\nPhoto montage below; click on image to view.\n\nEmile Gruppe’s “Clam Diggers” as Shared by the Late Frances Langford, SLR/IRL\n\nWater…and the gifts of life from the water….\n\nToday I am sharing a beautiful work of art that is connected to our St Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon by the late, famous, and long time resident, Frances Langford. She resided most of her life along both rivers’ shores.\n\nKimberly Falconer is a friend of mine that I grew up with here in Martin County. Kim now lives in Miami as owner of “Ocean Adventures.” After reading my blog post a few weeks back about the famed Gruppe collection of Frances Langford, she wrote:\n\n“—-thought I would share a few images with you. This one is of artist Emile Gruppe’s painting entitled“Clam Diggers Gloucester, MA.” It was reproduced as a Christmas card by Frances. Feel free to use it however you wish. Credit for sharing should go to my mother, Gloria Cabre Fike.” (Kim’s family was great friends with the late Mrs. Langford.)\n\nToday is supposed to bring heavy rains again due to the El Nino conditions. Our St Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon will continue to be destroyed by releases from Lake Okeechobee and the area canals. I though this image might be of interest and inspiration and a break from the aerial photos. Think of it as an early Christmas card from Frances Langford.\n\nI think the image says a lot about the intricate relationship between man and water whether it be in Massachusetts or Florida.\n\nFormer blog post on Gruppe collection, Frances Langford: http://jacquithurlowlippisch.com/2016/01/20/emile-gruppes-the-hut-and-the-heart-of-frances-langford-slrirl/\n\nFrances Langford Estate–2008, SLR/IRL\n\nMy Frances Langford theme continues. Today I will share some photos of Frances’ St Lucie River estate treasures given to me by blog reader and salvage director, Bobbi Blodgett. Bobbi recently contacted me. Not only did we have a very interesting conversation regarding the recent destruction of the Langford property and the difficulties of getting developers to “reuse and recycle,” but Bobbi also shared some good news about what was “salvaged” from the Langford Estate in 2008 when it was first being “deconstructed,” as part a tax write off for the developers via Habitat For Humanity.\n\nHer email reads:\n\n“Hi Jacqui,\n\nLangford additional pics during 2008 deconstruction project. Frances was very into Polynesian style and the “tapa cloth” pictured, we salvaged also, It was all handmade and imported. It was laid on the bars, walls etc.\n\nThe long bar was in the river house. I believe it was purchased by a couple who bought the house she owned on Hutchinson Island, which is awesome.”\n\nReUse Salvage Inc.\n\nBobbi Blodgett, Director\n\n“Green & Clean”\n\nDe-construction Services\n\nRemoval of Products for Reuse\n\nhttp://www.reusesalvage.com/\n\nThank you to Bobbi for allowing me to share so many pictures. It is fun just to look through them. So many memories! Thank you for this historic documentation. May everyone enjoy!\n\n“Scraped and Pillaged,” the Former Frances Langford Estate, SLR/IRL\n\nToday I continue documentation of the former Frances Langford Estate, the 53 acres bordering Mount Pisgah and the Town of Sewall’s Point. Mount Pisgah, at 57 feet, is the highest point in the region along the St Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon.\n\nI have written on this topic extensively already. Perhaps, too much. So I’ll keep it short and just say, once again…”There has to be a better way to develop property with such historical significance, and once, such tremendous natural beauty.”\n\nYes—- this type of development is within the law, but is it within our conscience? What was Martin County and the Commission thinking when they approved this transfer? How can we stop this from happening again? Can we?\n\nAnyway—I did recently visit the site and the “Engineer of Record” assured me the high bluff will not be leveled to allow for more homes as is rumored.\n\n“It is the lot’s majestic view of the water that we want…” he said. Six will face the river. You can see that lots are small compared to Sewall’s Point.\n\nPersonally, I think it would have looked even more majestic if some of Mrs Langford’s world-famous tropical vegetation and pond had been left and the lots were not so crammed in.\n\nIn conclusion, here are some photos for “the record.”\n\nThank you to my husband, Ed Lippisch for taking the aerials. All were taken yesterday, January 20th, 2016.\n\nOh, by the way, when I was leaving I noticed the documents stated that the cleared land had to be “seeded” within 30 days. We’re getting close. The lot was cleared at Christmas. I bet they put in sod. From tropical paradise to sodded conformity. What a loss.\n\nDevelopment documents for subdivision being put on property: Langford’s Landing:\n\n(https://documents.martin.fl.us/Documents2010/content/Agenda_Items/gmd/2015/8D1-2014-12-16%20Langford%20Landing%20Final%20Site%20Plan.pdf)\n\nPrevious blog post on topic:(http://jacquithurlowlippisch.com/2016/01/04/langford-landing-a-tribute-to-the-late-frances-langford-st-lucie-riverindian-river-lagoon/)\n\nEmile Gruppe, “The Hut,” and the Heart of Frances Langford, SLR/IRL\n\nSometimes things are a mystery and reveal themselves slowly through many days…such is the story of black and white sketch of “The Hut” you see above.\n\nI first saw the piece in an email dated January 14th, 2016, sent to me by my mother, historian Sandra Thurlow. Her email read: “I came across this in a box of treasures. It was an invitation to a joint birthday party for Talley Crary, Frances Langford Stuart, and Jane Merrell. I guess it was “The, with a capital, Hut.” Mom\n\nPrior to receiving this email I had traveled on a yacht up the St Lucie River with my next door neighbor Mr Rohloff—this was two days after Christmas. This was when Ed and I saw up close the destruction of the former Langford Estate. Cleared to the bone.\n\nWhen the captain of Mr Rohloff’s yacht heard me gasping as I saw Mrs Langford’s wrecked estate he told me he used to live on there, and was married there, and that he actually worked for Mrs Langford for some time. His name is Rick Copeland. Captain Copland continued to talk about Mrs Langford throughout the trip and told stories of what a remarkable person she was.\n\nHe told a story that as she was aging she gathered all the painting of Emile Gruppe who she and her husband collected and gave them to the artist’ son. “These were very expensive paintings……” She wanted to make certain they were given to the right place and appreciated….\n\nNow fast forward to last weekend. I attended an Environmental Studies Luncheon and sat next to Matt Kelly, who oversees the real estate for Martin Health Systems and years ago was my swimming coach. He took his phone out showing me the same ‘The Hut” piece going back in an email to the son of Emile Grippe and with my sister who works for MHS.\n\nIt’s a small world and the heart of Frances Langford lives on!\n\nBy just doing a quick search on the internet I found an article about an art show in 2013 in Naples of these Langford/Evenrude paintings! The Gruppe family is very famous and there were three generations of paintings as you will read.\n\nIt would be fun if I could find more of the the paintings to share. Here’s one I found. Mrs Langford called her house along the St Lucie River, the “River House,”—maybe this is hers?\n\nNaples show of Evinrude/Langford paintings: http://www.news-press.com/story/news/2013/02/01/gruppe-family-painters-to-be-featured-in-world-class-exhibit/4262633/?from=global&sessionKey=&autologin=\n\nEmile Gruppe: http://www.emilegruppegallery.com/biographyemileagruppe.html\n\nPower to the Peacocks! The Spirit of Frances Langford, SLR/IRL\n\nAs we all know, movie star and local philanthropists, Frances Langford, was and is very loved in Martin County. Nonetheless, recently her 53 acre river estate, in Rio, was mowed down for development to create ironically “Langford’s Landing.” Yes, it was legal, but what a shame. What a crime of local history. Part of that history included Frances’ flock of peacocks.\n\nInvasive or not, Frances brought the exotic birds to her property in the 1940s and they had been happily living here ever since. They became part of the cultural landscape of the Rio area. Over the years the county even erected signs warning drivers about the birds.\n\nAfter Frances’ death in 2005 there were tougher times for the peacocks, peahens, and peachicks but they managed to survive. They had become “wild” living off the land although some residents would joyfully feed them. Kind of like cardinals…. 🙂\n\nSometimes stopping traffic as they lollygagg across State Road 707, the birds cause smiles and sometimes cursing and horn blowing from drivers. Inconvenient? Maybe— but so cool! So local! So “Frances”…..a reminder of her philanthropic spirit and love for our area with every sighting!\n\nOf course since the 53 acres has been clear-cut and scraped the peacocks have lost their home base habitat. Did anyone even think about this? I mentioned it at a county commission meeting years ago. Perhaps the county thought no one would notice when the birds fell on hard times or were possibly eradicated?\n\nThis was not the case. Not along the Indian River Lagoon…not in the land of River Warriors.\n\nYesterday there was a great win for the spirit of Frances Langford and the peacocks when resident Toni Rummo used social media to inform the public that a bank and real estate agency had “ordered the trapping of the peacocks at 1547 SW Sottlong Avenue.”\n\nThe house is in foreclosure and the cleaning people were apparently put off by all the birds. This led to the trapping or quote for such. According to Rummo some birds were trapped but after the outcry the others were left alone. Even the media, Sheriff’s department, and Martin County Commission got involved. It was crazy!\n\nThan you to Toni Rummo and the others! Just to follow up, I spoke to Bill Dean head of Century 21 on Hutchinson Island whose company was incorrectly linked with the sale and he said it was a day like no other. The phone rang off the hook!\n\nAt the end of the conversation I said: “But isn’t it great? The love of Frances Langford and the people standing up for her spirit?”\n\nWe laughed. I recommended having a gin and tonic in her honor.\n\nThank you Toni for the peacock win! It was a win for the people of Rio. A win for the spirit of Frances Langford, and a win for the spirit of St Lucie River/ Indian River Lagoon!\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Langford\n\nFrances Langford Property– time capsule flights– 1940, 1974, 1952, 1958…SLR/IRL\n\nToday I am featuring two more time line videos on Frances Langford’s property created by my brother Todd Thurlow. Through viewing history, we get a better understanding of how we got to where we are today…\n\nLangford Property 1940 to 1974\n\n(https://youtu.be/9joOtGz2D44)\n\nLangford Property Flyover 1940, 1952 and 1958\n\n(https://youtu.be/bb224nq_ehU)\n\n“Langford Landing,” a Tribute to the Late Frances Langford? St Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon\n\n“I am sure the new development will be re-landscaped very beautifully, but it is hard to see the once serene property so desecrated.” –Local historian, Sandra Thurlow, 2016\n\n“Frances Langford,” the name is as beautiful as the woman. She is a legend here in Martin County and much of the world. No one has been more generous, loving, and appreciative towards our community. A true philanthropist, her name graces buildings, parks, and centers from the Indian River Lagoon to Indiantown.\n\nAs a singer and movie star, she is best known for “entertaining the troops” during World War II aside Bob Hope. Through her family, young Frances was exposed to Jensen Beach, and later, after the war, came back to create her dream: “Frances Langford’s Polynesian Outrigger Resort.” It sat along the beautiful St Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon just north of Sewall’s Point.\n\nOver time, inspired by her travels, Frances and her husbands created a tropical paradise known far and wide. Cottages, a restaurant, a marina, palm trees, rare foliage, freshwater ponds, peacocks, and even swans graced the property. Famous movie stars often visited. She gave Martin County a reputation and she put it on the map. She made Martin County’s Jensen Beach her permanent home.\n\nFrances chose to build her personal residence near Mount Pisgah, the highest point of the peninsula. Lore has it that pirates and Indians once lived here too, standing on the high bluff looking for passing ships in the ocean. The property is steeped in beauty, history, and mystery. Sadly, in the end, the remaining 53 acre parcel was treated like any other piece of real estate.\n\nAfter a long wait since the 2008 Great Recession, the property is finally being developed ironically as “Langford Landing.” The manner in which this is being done has taken most us by surprise.\n\nIs it really necessary to remove every beloved palm tree, stately strangler fig, and blade of grass? Surely Frances thought some of her legacy might stand. It has not. The majority of the property has been scraped clean for new development. My sister said it best: “Jacqui, from the water, it looks like the property has been Napalmed.”\n\nThere has to be—-a better way.\n\nVideo of Ed and my flight over Langford Estate 1-1-16, juxtaposed to historic photographs, created by Todd Thurlow.
