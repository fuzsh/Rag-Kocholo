        "meta_description": "“Just\r\nplay it like a nagging wife” was comedy writer Philip Rapp’s suggestion to\r\nactress-singer Frances Langford, who was about to take on a facet of radio\r\nperforming with which she had only a passing familiarity.  Frances, born\r\nFrances Newbern Langford in Lakeland, FL on this date in 1913, had traded funny\r\nquips with comedian Bob Hope as the vocalist on his Pepsodent show from 1941 to\r\n1946 (not to mention accompanying him on his many overseas jaunts during WW2),\r\nand before that she appeared in musical comedies such as Broadway\r\nMelody of 1936 (1935) and Born to Dance (1936). \r\nBut portraying Blanche Bickerson, the never-ceasing shrewish spouse of the\r\nhapless John Bickerson (played by Don Ameche), would be a new experience for\r\nher.  Langford took it in stride.  As she reminisced in an interview\r\nyears later, “Actually, it wasn’t that hard to do at all.  Phil’s\r\nscripts were so well written that the laughs got themselves.”From childhood,\r\na musical career seemed to be in the tea leaves for young Frances.  Her\r\nmother was Annie Newbern, a renowned concert pianist, and Frances set her\r\nsights on studying music at Florida Southern College.  Her operatic\r\nambitions were sidelined by a tonsillectomy she underwent at age 17—the result\r\nwas that her beautiful soprano voice had been transformed into a husky\r\ncontralto.  Fortunately for Langford, she had the perfect pipes for the\r\nbig band era, which was just getting underway at that time.  Eli Witt, a\r\nTampa cigar manufacturer, heard Frances sing at an American Legion party and\r\nhired her to do her thing on his local radio show for $5 a week.  It was\r\nthere that she attracted the notice of the Vagabond Lover himself, Rudy Vallee,\r\nwho invited her to sing on his popular Fleischmann Hour.Invited\r\nto New York, Frances entertained at a birthday party for Cole Porter…and that’s\r\nwhere she was heard by Paramount’s Walter Wanger, who signed her to a movie\r\ncontract without a screen test.  In Hollywood, Frances had appeared in two\r\nshort subjects for Vitaphone-Warner Brothers (circa 1932), but under Wanger’s\r\ntutelage she made her feature film debut (alongside Alice Faye, George Raft,\r\nand Patsy Kelly) in 1935’s Every Night at Eight. Every\r\nNight was the movie in which Frances sang what would become her\r\nsignature tune, I’m in the Mood for Love.  The vocalist\r\ncharted several popular songs, including I’ve Got You Under My\r\nSkin, I Feel a Song Comin’ On, Easy to Love, Harbor\r\nLights, So Many Memories, Was it Rain?, and Falling\r\nin Love with Love.  In addition, Langford would be in much demand for\r\nmovie musicals, gracing the cast of tunefests like Collegiate (1936), Palm\r\nSprings (1936), The Hit Parade (1937), and Hollywood\r\nHotel (1937).That\r\nlast film was a movie version of a popular radio variety program hosted by\r\ngossip maven Louella Parsons and featuring boy crooner Dick Powell. \r\nFrances would be a regular on Hollywood Hotel from 1934\r\nto 1938, and she was also building a radio resume that included The\r\nSpartan Hour, The Colgate House Party (also\r\nknown as The Joe Cook Show), and The Texaco Star\r\nTheatre (starring Ken Murray).  When Bob Hope asked her to\r\naccompany him on the first of many excursions he would make to\r\nentertain those in the military during the Second World War, Langford also\r\njoined Hope’s weekly radio show as the featured vocalist.  Her many visits\r\nto military bases in the U.S. and around the world inspired Frances\r\nto keep a journal, which would eventually be printed in Hearst-owned newspapers\r\nas a regular column (“Purple Heart Diary”).Despite\r\nthe hectic pace of “entertaining the troops,” Frances Langford still found time\r\nto make movies.  She appeared in such films as Dreaming Out Loud (1940—the\r\nfirst of several films starring the boys from Pine Ridge, Lum ‘n’ Abner), Too\r\nMany Girls (1940—with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz), and Swing\r\nIt Soldier (1941—Frances plays twins, and the movie also features Hanley\r\nStafford, Don Wilson, and Brenda [Blanche Stewart] and Cobina [Elvia\r\nAllman]!).  For 1941’s All-American Co Ed, Langford dyed her\r\nbrunette tresses blonde, and kept them that way for the rest of her\r\ncareer.  Although Frances appeared in major motion pictures like Yankee\r\nDoodle Dandy (1942) and This is the Army (1943), most\r\nof her film appearances were in smaller B-musicals (several built around radio\r\nthemes), including Follow the Band (1943), Cowboy in\r\nManhattan (1943), Never a Dull Moment (1943), Career\r\nGirl (1944), Radio Stars on Parade(1945), People\r\nare Funny (1946), The Bamboo Blonde (1946), and Beat\r\nthe Band (1947).  Langford would close out the 1940s with a\r\nB-western, Deputy Marshal (1949), which bears the distinction\r\nof featuring actor Jon Hall (her real-life husband) as her leading man (it\r\nwould be their only film together).On\r\nradio, Frances Langford starred on The Chase and Sanborn Hour—a\r\n1945 summer replacement for the popular program starring Edgar Bergen &amp;\r\nCharlie McCarthy.  Langford would headline another summer show\r\nin 1947, when George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen took a break from Maxwell\r\nHouse Coffee Time.  It was with Don Ameche on\r\nNBC’s The Drene Show (also known as Drene\r\nTime) in the fall of 1946, however, that Frances would play the radio\r\nrole for which she’s best known today.  Ameche and Langford would\r\nconvulse listeners every week as “The Battling\r\nBickersons.”  After their show for Drene, the pair would join\r\nFrank Morgan for The Old Gold Show, which ran on CBS from\r\n1947 to 1948.  Despite the popularity of the Bickersons\r\nsketches, radio had a hard time turning their verbal squabbling into\r\na regular series. There was a half-hour audition\r\nrecord made in 1948, and “The Bickersons” continued to be heard\r\noccasionally on the Bergen-McCarthy program (with Marsha Hunt\r\nreplacing Frances as Blanche.)  But in the summer of 1951, Langford\r\nreprised her role in a full CBS sitcom devoted to the couple, with Lew Parker\r\nreplacing Ameche as John.In\r\nthe 1950s, Frances Langford would make two more motion pictures: Purple\r\nHeart Diary (1951), based on the previously mentioned column detailing\r\nLangford’s WW2 experiences, and The Glenn Miller Story (1954)—Frances\r\nplayed herself in both movies.  By this time, she was turning her\r\nattention to television.  With Don Ameche, Langford had a go at\r\nmaking the Bickersons a small screen success in the series Star Time (1950)\r\nand The Francis Langford-Don Ameche Show (1951-52). \r\nLangford would later headline Francis Langford Presents in\r\n1959, and The Francis Langford Show in 1960…but for the\r\nmost part, was content to appear on TV screens in a guest star capacity on\r\nshows hosted by Spike Jones, Jackie Gleason, Jack Carter, and Perry Como, among\r\nthe many.  In the 1960s, she chatted on talk shows hosted by Johnny Carson\r\nand Mike Douglas and made appearances on series like The DuPont Show\r\nof the Week and The Hollywood Palace.For\r\nall intents and purposes, Frances Langford left Hollywood in 1955…and with her\r\nsecond husband, Ralph Evinrude, settled for a more content existence in Jensen\r\nBeach, FL as the featured singer in a nightclub, The Frances Langford Outrigger\r\nResort.  Frances was devoted to philanthropic causes, giving generously to\r\nThe Florida Oceanographic Society on Hutchinson Island, and a park in Jensen\r\nBeach also bears her name (Langford Park).  Langford lived to the ripe-old\r\nage of 92 before her passing in 2005, and to this day entertains fans old and\r\nnew with CD collections of her songs and radio appearances.And\r\nspeaking of CD collections (oh, these segueways just write themselves\r\nsometimes), Radio Spirits features our birthday girl’s signature role as\r\nBlanche in the hilarious Bickersons set Put Out the Lights!—with a program\r\nguide penned by my chum Ben Ohmart, whose Bear Manor Media publication The\r\nBickersons came in mighty handy writing this post.  Frances can\r\nalso be heard among many singing celebrities in the 3-CD collection With a Song in My Heart: Hooray for Hollywood (Langford\r\nsings Hooray for Hollywood from Hollywood Hotel,\r\nand with James Cagney—from Yankee Doodle Dandy—Over There). \r\nOn the DVD front, check out a most entertaining documentary entitled Entertaining the Troops, which allows\r\nFrances to stroll down Memory Lane with Bob Hope, dancer Patty Thomas, and\r\nguitarist Tony Romano…as well as feature timeless clips from your old-time\r\nradio favorites “doin’ their bit.”  Happiest of birthdays to you, Frances!",
