        "text": "posted 12-16-2007 11:46 PM ET (US) Frances Langford, the famous movie actress who in 1955 married OMC founder Ralph Evinrude, is lauded for her charitable contributions in this Florida newspaper article:\n\nhttp://www.tcpalm.com/news/2007/dec/15/no-headline-16slangford/\n\nIf you bought an old OMC motor, you should know that some of the profit from that sale probably has gone to a charitable cause.\n\nLangford, Evinrude, and their famous yacht CHANTICLEER were frequent visitors to the Great Lakes, particularly to the North Channel of Lake Huron. We first saw Ms. Langford cruising in 1987, when anchored off her small cabin at \"The Pool.\" In 1997 we followed CHANTICLEER into Baie Fine. And in 2001 we had the pleasure of seeing Ms. Langford and her beautiful yacht at Little Current, Manitoulin Island, our last encounter with them.\n\nRalph Evinrude died in 1986. Ms. Lanford passed away in 2005 at the age of 92. A foundation continues their charitable giving."
