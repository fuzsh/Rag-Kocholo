        "text": "Frances Langford, a mellow contralto who ventured into combat zones with Bob Hope's troupe during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to serenade tens of thousands of servicemen with ballads that reminded them of the girls they left behind, died yesterday at her home in Jensen Beach, Fla. She was 92.\n\nHer death was announced by her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr., The Associated Press reported.\n\nAlthough she regarded herself as more of a singer than an actress, she appeared in roughly 30 films and was half of the successful radio comedy duo \"The Bickersons,\" in which she and Don Ameche played a mismatched, querulous couple. He was devoted to ignoring her and concentrating on sleeping, the only time in the day, he said, when he felt alive; she was an insomniac who needed him as a refuge because she couldn't get to sleep. The show became so popular that it received a Sunday night spot of its own.\n\nBut among radio listeners, moviegoers and later a vast audience of G.I.'s, Miss Langford was known for songs like \"I'm in the Mood for Love,\" \"You Are My Lucky Star\" and \"Hooray for Hollywood.\"\n\nMr. Hope thought of her as one of his three gypsies -- entertainers who were willing, like him, to travel all over the globe to entertain the troops. The other two were Jerry Colonna, a bulgy-eyed comic who liked to sing \"On the Road to Mandalay,\" and Tony Romano, a guitarist who sang, arranged and accompanied other talent.\n\nMr. Hope recalled her with characteristic snip: \"She knows just how much sex to pour and still be dignified.\" The troops frequently asked Miss Langford to sing \"I'm in the Mood for Love,\" a ballad by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, her hit record from an otherwise forgettable 1935 movie, \"Every Night at Eight,\" which was mostly a vehicle for George Raft and Alice Faye.\n\n\"The greatest thing in my life was entertaining the troops,\" Miss Langford told The Palm Beach Post years later. She said she was fascinated as well as frightened by being in or close to combat zones. On one occasion, near Bizerte in North Africa, she saw six planes shot down. On two occasions she was in planes that developed engine trouble; one of them crash-landed in New South Wales, Australia, on a flight from Guadalcanal. The other plane landed safely, but not before Miss Langford volunteered to don a parachute and jump.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
