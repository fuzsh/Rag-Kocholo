        "text": "Frances Langford, a singer and actress who catapulted from Lakeland talent shows to Hollywood prominence and endeared herself to \"the Greatest Generation\" during World War II military entertainment tours, died Monday. She was 92.\n\nLangford outlived virtually all of her contemporaries from Lakeland High School, but she left an impression on those who witnessed her return performances in later years. Sally Allsopp recalls seeing Langford appear in Lakeland several decades ago when Allsopp was a child taking dance lessons from the father of Buddy Ebsen, one of Langford's Hollywood co-stars.\n\nAllsopp said Langford was in town to sing at the now-defunct Lake Theater on Main Street. The famous actress attended a recital by the dance troupe of which Allsopp was a part.\n\nWhile Allsopp remembers Langford as gracious to the young dancers, Langford's vocal performance made a greater impact.\n\n\"She was just marvelous,\" Allsopp said Monday. \"She just enchanted the audience with her marvelous voice.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Langford died of congestive heart failure in Jensen Beach, where she had lived for decades. She was survived by her third husband, Harold Stuart, a former assistant secretary of the Air Force whom she married in 1994. She had no children.\n\nJulia Frances Langford was born April 4, 1913. Although it's been widely reported that she was born in Lakeland, Hampton Dunn's book \"Lakeland: A Pictorial History\" said her birthplace was Hernando, a small town in Citrus County.\n\nLangford established herself as a talented singer by the time she entered Lakeland High School in 1928.\n\nLangford, who envisioned a career as a soprano opera singer, contracted a case of bronchitis as a teen and underwent a tonsillectomy in 1930. The operation transformed her airy voice into a huskier one, but she adapted to the new tone and continued singing.\n\nShe won a local American Legion talent contest, drawing notice from bandleader Frank Grasso, who helped her gain a $5-a-week contract to sing on a music program carried by WDAE, a radio station in Tampa. Langford left high school and studied music for a time at Florida Southern College.\n\nThe connections at the Tampa radio station brought Langford to the attention of Rudy Vallee, a nationally known bandleader whose ensemble regularly toured Florida. Dunn, in his 1990 book, wrote that Vallee heard Langford sing during a 1931 tour stop in Miami.\n\n\"The minute she opened her mouth, I knew she was a natural-born singer full-blown and ready for stardom,\" Vallee told Dunn.\n\nThat stardom came in 1935, when the 5-foot-l Langford appeared in the film \"Every Night at Eight,\" a musical starring George Raft. The movie provided Langford with the song \"I'm in the Mood for Love,\" which became the biggest hit of a singing career that included sales of 15 million records, according to Dunn's book.\n\nSome 30 movie roles followed in the next two decades, and Langford shared the screen with the likes of Jack Benny, James Stewart, Susan Hayward, James Cagney, Duke Ellington and Ronald Reagan. She also had success in radio, playing the wife of Don Ameche's character on the hit 1940s radio comedy \"The Bickersons.\"\n\nWhile \"I'm in the Mood for Love\" remained her trademark number, Langford also had success with such tunes as \"Blue Moon\" and Cole Porter's \"Night and Day.\"\n\nD. Burke Kibler, a 1941 graduate of Lakeland High School, recalls Langford's triumphant return visits to town when he was young. Kibler said Langford impressed the locals with the car she drove -- a yellow Cord convertible with chrome pipes coming out of the hood.\n\n\"She was clearly a significant presence in the Lakeland community because we didn't have very many celebrities in those days,\" said Kibler, 81, chairman emeritus of the Holland & Knight law firm. \"She would come, and her car would attract great attention.\"\n\nLongtime Lakeland resident Ted Covington said rumors of Langford's presence in the area were enough to draw a crowd in his native Plant City.\n\n\"The word got around somehow that Frances Langford was coming through town,\" recalled Covington, 85, \"so we stood out on the curb in front of an ice cream parlor and watched her go by.\"\n\nIn 1941, Langford replaced Judy Garland in Bob Hope's Pepsodent Radio Show, and Hope soon enlisted her to join a U.S.O. troupe that entertained American troops fighting in Europe and in the South Pacific during World War II. Langford, who became a blonde, continued the duty during the Korean and Vietnam wars, and she sang for nearly 5 million American soldiers during her U.S.O. tenure, according to her biography with the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n\"After the war was over, the troops were still there and she went on the U.S.O. (tours) with Bob Hope,\" said Kibler, who served in the Army during World War II. \"She didn't turn her back on the audiences that had really given her that great velocity during wartime.\"\n\nShe recalled in interviews decades later that entertaining the troops \"was the greatest thing in my life.\"\n\n\"We were there just to do our job, to help make them laugh and be happy if they could,\" Langford told The Associated Press in January 2002.\n\nLangford married actor Jon Hall in the 1930s, but they divorced in 1955. She soon married Ralph Evinrude, the boat motor tycoon, and they settled in Jensen Beach, a coastal town north of West Palm Beach. The couple spent much of their time on the Chanticleer, a 110-foot yacht, and they traveled each summer to Canada.\n\nThough she made her last movie in the 1950s and retired from U.S.O. tours in 1966, Langford continued to sing into the 1980s at the Outrigger Resort, a nightclub she owned in Jensen Beach. Evinrude died in 1986.\n\nLangford met Harold Stuart in the 1950s, and after the death of her second husband they reunited. They were married 1994.\n\nThe state of Florida inducted Langford into its Women's Hall of Fame in 2002. Ferguson Addison, a West Palm Beach banker, led the nomination effort, with help from James M. Denham, a professor of history at Florida Southern College.\n\nAddison, 82, said a cousin played piano at WDAE in Tampa when Langford was singing for the station in the early 1930s. He only saw her perform once, at a Miami theater in 1954, and he waited at the stage door to chat with her afterward. It turned out they were distantly related.\n\n\"She was wonderful,\" Addison said of the performance. \"The applause was thundering. Everyone just said, `More, more, more.' \"\n\nLangford's legacy endures in one of Lakeland's best-known landmarks, the Frances Langford Promenade around Lake Mirror, so named in 1946. Kibler recalls that a glee club in Lakeland also was named for her.\n\nLangford, who accrued great wealth during her career, was known for charitable acts. Addison said she donated generously to the Florida Oceanographic Coastal Center in Stuart and provided uniforms for a high school band in Martin County.\n\nGary White can be reached at gary.white@theledger.com or at 863-802-7518. Ledger researcher Sandy Kline and The Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFrances Langford appeared in a number of films and on television. The titles include:\n\n\"The Glenn Miller Story,\" 1954 (also featuring James Stewart, Louis Armstrong)\n\n\"The Bamboo Blonde,\" 1946\n\n\"People Are Funny,\" 1946 (Art Linkletter, Ozzie Nelson)\n\n\"Girl Rush,\" 1944\n\n\"Follow the Band,\" 1943 (Robert Mitchum)\n\n\"This Is the Army,\" 1943 (Ronald Reagan, Joe Louis)\n\n\"Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" 1942 (James Cagney)\n\n\"Swing It Soldier,\" 1941\n\n\"Too Many Girls,\" 1940\n\n\"The Hit Parade,\" 1937 (Duke Ellington)\n\n\"Hollywood Hotel,\" 1937 (Benny Goodman, Susan Hayward, Ronald Reagan)\n\n\"Palm Springs,\" 1936 (David Niven)\n\n\"Born to Dance,\" 1936 (James Stewart, Buddy Ebsen)\n\n\"Collegiate,\" 1936 (Betty Grable)\n\n\"Broadway Melody of 1936,\" 1935 (Jack Benny, Buddy Ebsen)\n\nTHE STAR CAPTURED\n\nIn \"Lakeland, A Pictorial History\" published by the late Hampton Dunn in 1990, the former newspaper reporter shared thoughts about Frances Langford, whom he interview several times. Following are some excerpts from the book: \"It wasn't all gloom in Lakeland during those dark days of the Depression. For a petite, talented young Lakelander blossomed out during that period as a fabulous star of radio and the movies. Her name, emblazoned in bright lights around the country, was Frances Langford.\" * * * \"I started out with a coloratura soprano voice. That wasn't very popular with the kids at school. My ambition at the time was to be an opera singer. But then I had very bad bronchitis for so long and the doctor said that my tonsils would have to come out. He didn't know if I would be able to sing at all after that. After my throat healed, I decided to try it, and it was altogether different. I was real happy with it.\" -- Frances Langford * * * \"The minute she opened her mouth, I knew she was a natural-born singer, full-blown and ready for stardom.\" -- Singing star Rudy Vallee, who was touring with his band in Miami and signed her for his network radio program\n\nA LIFE OF PERFORMING"
