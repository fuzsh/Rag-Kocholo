        "text": "Before moving to her estate in Jensen Beach in 1945, Frances Langford was an internationally renowned star with a career that included singing and acting in more than 30 films, four radio programs and three television shows during World War II, she entertained the troops with her signature tune, “I’m in the Mood for Love” with Bob Hope’s USO tours. Later, Hope and other celebrities would be guests on the Chanticleer, the 110-foot fishing yacht owned by Ms. Langford and her husband, Harold Stuart.\n\nMs. Langford was known throughout Martin County for her generosity to the community she called home.\n\nAn active angler, she supported local environmental causes and hosting fundraising events on the Chanticleer and her estate, which she shared with her beloved peacocks. Before her passing in 2005, she created the Frances Langford Foundation that provided more than $26 million in grants to 122 agencies, including: Florida Oceanographic Society, Elliott Museum, Lyric Theatre, SafeSpace, Salvation Army, Martin County Council on Aging, Mary’s Shelter, Molly’s House, Martin Health System, Treasure Coast Hospice, the Arts Council of Martin County, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Martin County, the Children’s Museum of the Treasure Coast, the United Way of Martin County, Volunteers in Medicine and the Visiting Nurses Association.\n\nIn 2016, the Frances Langford Foundation Trustees chose The Community Foundation to become the steward of the remaining funds, valued at $7.7 million."
