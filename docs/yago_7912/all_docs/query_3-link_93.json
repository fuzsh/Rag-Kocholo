        "text": "A sprawling Malibu-style beach house with a glamorous Hollywood pedigree comes ashore to the Florida market, specifically Hutchinson Island, an East Coast hamlet known for its loggerhead turtles, seashells, sea glass and celebrities.\n\nLocated on the island’s south end, the 7,792-square-foot property is the former home of actress Francis Langford and her boating magnate husband at the time Ralph Evinrude, a prominent couple who entertained 1950s icons like Bob Hope, James Cagney, Jackie Gleason, Perry Como and Don Ameche.\n\nFrancis Langford was the glamorous singer-songwriter of the classic song “I’m In The Mood For Love” (from her debut film Every Night At Eight) and she was popular during the golden age of radio. As an actress, she starred in Hollywood musicals like Cagney’s Yankee Doodle Dandy. She joined comedian Hope on some of his famous USO tours, entertaining military troops—even General George S. Patton.\n\nLater in life, she later married Ralph Evinrude, an outboard motor tycoon. By the 1980s, the couple owned a 108-foot yacht called Chanticleer, where they also entertained their celebrity friends.\n\nLike the yacht, the Hutchinson Island house was designed for entertainers and beach lovers. This luxury real estate listed for $6 million, by Blaine “Doc” Ellingson of ONE Sotheby’s International Realty.\n\nThe private-gated residence features quirky architectural and design elements such as Pecky Cyprus walls, Green Heart tree trunks imported from South America, a fireplace crafted from London Bridge original granite, and bricks from Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas (barrier islands 70 miles west of Key West).\n\nIt’s hardly surprising a Hollywood entertainers’ home was designed for entertaining. Steps from the beach, the oceanfront residence offers five private bedrooms, united by covered patios overlooking sweeping Atlantic Ocean views.\n\nOutdoor entertainment spaces boast a cabana bar, custom-lit pool and hot spa encircled by Polynesian tiki torches, and landscaped gardens with tropical foliage and coconut palms.\n\nHutchinson Island is known for its loggerhead turtle nesting areas. Each season, five species migrate to the island where residents marvel at morning turtle tracks along the beach.\n\nThe island is located near offshore natural and artificial reefs that wrecked Spanish galleons during the 17th and 18th centuries, allowing for rare ancient artifacts, seashells and sea glass to wash ashore.\n\nHutchinson Island rivals Sanibel Island for low tide seashell and sea glass beach combing. Sand dollar beds can be found walking or snorkeling along sandbars.\n\nHowever, discriminating hunters must leave live purplish or greenish sand dollars on the beach. White sand dollars are all yours—for free.\n\nBut this Ocean Blvd. Hutchinson Island home will cost you a few shekeles more."
