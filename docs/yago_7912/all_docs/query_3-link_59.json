        "text": "STUART, FL – The United Way of Martin County Foundation was proud to announce Elizabeth (Betsy) Herold as the 2024 Frances Langford Humanitarian Award recipient on Thursday, February 8, at Sailfish Point Country Club. This prestigious award recognizes community philanthropists who demonstrate care, compassion and commitment in support of United Way of Martin County and the non-profit sector.\n\nBetsy Herold's dedication to giving back has left an indelible mark on the community. Her philanthropic journey was inspired by her late husband, David, who instilled in her the direct impact of charitable giving. After his passing in 2008, Betsy continued their shared path of philanthropy.\n\nIntroduced to the transformative work of United Way by fellow Sailfish Point resident and former Chair of United Way’s Alexis de Tocqueville Society, Bob Croce, Betsy became a devoted supporter in 2010. Her involvement deepened over the years, and she became a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society in 2014. In 2022, she further solidified her commitment by joining the Tocqueville Legacy Circle.\n\n\"It was Bob who first opened my eyes to the power of United Way,” Betsy said. “He spoke about their impact on our community, the breadth of their programs, and how every dollar they raised stayed local. His passion was contagious, and I knew I had to be involved.\"\n\nThe award was named in honor of the famed singer, actress and long-time resident of Martin County, Frances Langford who trusted United Way with the dual mandate of transforming lives and fortifying community bonds. Langford also served as the pioneering chair of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, igniting a legacy of leadership. Her dedication and commitment to community advancement has played an integral role in shaping the organization into the agent of change it is today.\n\nFrances Langford Humanitarian Award recipients include:\n\n2011 – Robert & Carol Weissman\n\n2013 – Barbara Briggs Trimble\n\n2014 – Prestley & Helen Blake\n\n2015 – Douglass & Patricia Stewart\n\n2016 – John & Susan Sullivan\n\n2017 – H. William Lichtenberger\n\n2018 – Bob & Jan Crandall and Bill & Audrey Crandall\n\n2019 – Joe & Margaret Richebourg Temple\n\n2020 - John & Linda Loewenberg\n\n2021 – Fred & Betty Kopf\n\n2022 – Bob & Karen Croce\n\n2024 – Betsy Herold\n\nThe Frances Langford Humanitarian Award sculpture, a signature piece by Geoffrey C. Smith created especially for the United Way of Martin County Foundation, symbolizes the generosity of game-changers in our community. As an independent public charity, the Foundation is uniquely positioned to accept legacy gifts and build an endowment fund.\n\nDuring the reception, the Foundation revealed significant progress toward its goal of reaching a $13 million endowment fund. This milestone achievement will enable the organization to generate an additional $500,000 annually, empowering United Way to further enhance its community impact through vital initiatives now and years from now.\n\nThank you to our Reception Sponsors Bill and Audrey Crandall and Bob Crandall; and to our additional sponsors who helped make this event possible: Bill Lichtenberger, Seacoast Wealth Management, Bob Weissman, Wilmington Trust, HBK CPAs & Consultants and HBKS Wealth Advisors, Northern Trust, SouthState, Bank of America Private Bank, Carol Webb, Melanie Fenner, Keane Thomas & Pinnacoli, and Sandhill Cove."
