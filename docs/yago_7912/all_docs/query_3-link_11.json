        "text": "By Joe Crankshaw\n\nThis story has been modified from its original version, which incorrectly stated Frances Langford's birthplace. She was born in Lakeland in Polk County.\n\nNo matter who you are or where you live in Martin County, your life has probably been touched by the monumental generosity of the late Frances Langford Stuart.\n\nA review of the actress and singer's donations appears to indicate she has provided more support for charitable, educational, cultural and social organizations in Martin County than any other individual in the county's history. In her lifetime and through her Frances Langford Foundation after her death, she has donated more than $29 million in Martin County.\n\n\"There are very few people who have the strength of philanthropy that Frances displayed,\" said Robin Hicks-Connors, chief executive officer of the Martin County Historical Society and a former executive for the Martin County Council on Aging. \"I know of no local resident who equals her record. The definition of philanthropy is the love of mankind, and she certainly exemplified that definition.\"\n\nAnd from little leaguers to dying hospice patients, Langford's donations have made a difference.\n\nEven after her death in 2005, she is still impacting the community in a major way. In the last month, she has donated $5.5 million to two major projects — $3 million for the construction of the new Elliott Museum and $2.5 million for the new Council on Aging Charles and Rae Kane Senior Center.\n\nContributions from Langford — and her wealthy husbands, Ralph Evinrude, Outboard Marine Corporation founder, and Harold Stuart, Truman's undersecretary of the Air Force and an attorney — range from a heart care center to helping deliver Meals on Wheels.\n\nShe donated land and helped build ballfields at Langford Park. She provided instruments and band uniforms for Stuart High School, now known as Martin County High School, for 20 years. She helped the Florida Oceanographic Society develop its programs, which last year welcomed some 55,000 visitors.\n\nAnd her Foundation expects to continue making donations to local charities.\n\nNearly all of that money has stayed in Martin County.\n\nThe only organizations that aren't local are the Salvation Army and the Martin County Chapter of the American Red Cross, but those donations were for local activities. The Foundation's donation last year will help the Red Cross upgrade its local emergency response facilities should a storm or other disaster hit this area.\n\n\"Other than those two organizations, I am not aware of her giving to anything which was not local,\" said Evans Crary Jr., Langford's longtime attorney and now one of two trustees of the foundation.\n\nThose donations have had a major impact on quality of life for Martin County residents.\n\nRusty Brink, vice president of the Martin Memorial Foundation, which has received more than $9 million from Langford and her second husband, Ralph Evinrude, said Langford's donation of the money to build The Frances Langford Heart Center has benefited more than 1,460 patients.\n\n\"The first year, there were 260 open-heart surgeries performed, which certainly saved lives or improved the quality of life of the recipients,\" Brink said. \"More importantly, because of her gift, not one patient has been turned away from our doors.\"\n\nOpening the heart center has allowed patients to receive top-notch care close to their homes, which many physicians say aids in recovery.\n\nAlso, Langford's donations prompted others to donate, Brink said.\n\n\"Through her charitable giving, Frances knew she was making a positive impact on the community. We were indeed fortunate that Martin County was her home. Through her foundation, this legacy lives on,\" said Jim Vojcsik, executive director of the United Way of Martin County.\n\nLangford created the Foundation several years before she died. It draws on money accumulated over her lifetime, proceeds from the sale of her Jensen Beach estate and Outrigger Restaurant and from other business ventures.\n\nTwo attorneys, Crary and Oklahoma attorney John Turner decide who to donate to.\n\n\"Frances wanted to help local activities,\" Crary said. \"We continue her practice of primarily trying to help good organizations that at the time may be flying under the public's radar.\"\n\nThe Foundation hasn't determined how much it will be able to donate in the future, Crary said.\n\n\"We would hope it will be substantial,\" he said.\n\nAnd through it all, Langford never asked for recognition. Her name is only attached to the park, cardiac care center and buildings at the Florida Oceanographic Society. But she resisted having her name put on the park, one of her first major donations.\n\n\"She never wanted the name recognition which is certainly due her,\" Crary said.\n\nFamous worldwide for a career that included acting and singing in more than 30 films, four radio programs and three TV shows, Frances Langford was known locally for donating millions of dollars to dozens of charities, introducing peacocks to her estate in Rio and owning the Outrigger Resort on Indian River Drive where the Dolphin Bar and Shrimp House now sits.

The value of these donations over the years has not been calculated.\n\nThe Annual Stuart Christmas Boat Parade\n\nThe Blessing of the Fleet\n\nHOW THE FOUNDATION DECIDES\n\nDuring her lifetime, Frances Langford personally selected which organizations would receive support. \"She liked to find organizations just under the public radar and help them,\" said Evans Crary, long time a Langford attorney and foundation trustee. He said the foundation continues that philosophy, receiving and examining applications for support, then deciding who gets funds and when. Crary said he and Turner must be in agreement before any money is disbursed to any group. Crary, who has served as Langford's attorney for more than 50 years, said the chance to carry on her work \"is the opportunity of a lifetime, and I am most appreciative of the trust she placed in me.\""
