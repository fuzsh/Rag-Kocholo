A photo of John shows that he indeed had a twinkle in his eye and he appears to be good-humored. John did not drink alcohol, \"wouldn't touch a drop.\" His brother Andrew evidently drank a bit and is reputed to have been quite mean, especially to John.\n\nThe Kerr house had a wide hall dividing the rooms.\n\nAlthough the incident happened before her birth, Evie recalls a family story that describes John to be a man of good charactor: \"A man named Sam Thomas lived near New Hope Church. Sam and John knew each other their entire lives. Meetings were sometimes held in the church, school superintendent and the like. One night Sam Thomas got into an argument with a man named Ezra Cox. Sam got so mad that when Ezra went to leave the church, Sam shot him in the back, as he reached the doorway. John was at that meeting and witnessed the shooting. Later, as Sam's trial approached, men would come to John's house at night to try and convince him to lie on Sam's behalf about what he had seen. John refused to lie, saying, \"I told you 'don't do it, Sam,' and you did it anyway.\"\n\nOfficiating at John's marriage to Frances Alcestor Langford was Justice of the Peace M.R. Horn with a $100.00 marriage bond by John Z. Kerr and J. H. Dogan. Tallahatchie County marriage records show that John W. Langford gave consent to his daughter's marriage. The marriage license was issued by John T. Neely, Circuit Court Clerk, Tallahatchie Co., MS. (Note: marriage license spells John's name as John J. Kerr.)\n\nHis daughter Evie says that John was raised on one hill near New Hope Church and his future wife was raised on a neighboring hill. He liked coffee.
