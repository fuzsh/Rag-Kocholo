        "text": "Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA), Seibu Holdings and Seibu Railway Corporation signed a joint friendship agreement and sister railway relationship agreement on 14 March 2015 in Tokyo. The relevant celebration activities were organised and introduced on 17 March at Taipei Railway Station.\n\nThis friendship cooperation includes the sale for memorable train ticket and mutual exchange on tourism promotion and advertisement. In particular, both parties agree that when natural disasters occur, a rescue collaboration system will be initiated. This is the first time that TRA has signed an agreement with international railway companies to enhance rescue collaboration.\n\nThis collaboration project also marks two “Firsts.” This is the first time that the Director General of TRA has signed a collaboration agreement with an international railway company in a foreign country. Also, this is the first collaboration project that TRA itself and its affiliated business are both involved in, symbolising that the link between Japan and Taiwan on railway operation has achieved a new milestone.\n\nOver the next few years TRA is intending to develop and promote Taiwan’s railway tourism by establishing the alliance with international railway companies in order to increase overseas exposure and attract international tourists to visit Taiwan. In the near future, TRA will continue to establish friendships with other railway companies to jointly reach a win-win situation.\n\n(Source: TRA)"
