People living around the area can spot the character at Seibu Railway’s stations until May 10, 2024.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA special video featuring March 7th is being broadcast regularly at all 80 Seibu stations across Tokyo and Saitama during the event period. Each station is playing the video in a 30-minute interval from 7:30 AM to 7:30 PM JST.\n\nSeibu Railway is also decorating one of its train cars with Honkai: Star Rail characters. This train will go along the Seibu Ikebukuro Line that runs from Tokyo’s Ikebukuro Station to the Agano Station in Hannō, Saitama. People can also track this train’s exact location by downloading the Seibu Line app on Android and iOS devices.\n\nThis event appears as part of celebrations for the first anniversary of Honkai: Star Rail. HoYoverse first launched the game for PCs and mobile devices on April 26, 2023. It is also working with more Japanese companies to promote the anniversary in the country, ranging from the glasses brand Zoff to the convenience store chain Lawson.\n\nThe Honkai: Star Rail March 7th Railway Special Event will run at Seibu train stations until May 10, 2024."
