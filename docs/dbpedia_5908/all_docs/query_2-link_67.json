        "text": "The Seibu 101, New 101 and 301 series are Japanese suburban commuter electric multiple units operated by the Seibu Railway since March 1969.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe 101 series trains were designed as a powerful train with good braking performance. The sets were introduced on the Chichibu Line on all-stop services on the line in March 1969; these were the last Seibu trains to use the \"x01 series\" naming trend until the 001 series introduced in 2019. A total of 278 cars were manufactured by Seibu's Tokorozawa Works from 1969 to 1976.\n\nAn improved version of the 101 series sets was introduced in 1979, titled the New 101 series sets; these feature a slightly different fascia and were intended to complement the recently introduced 2000 series sets. For the first time, Seibu outsourced the design of their new trains to an external company, Tokyu Car Corporation, which manufactured a large number of New 101 series cars alongside the Tokorozawa Works. A derivative known as the 301 series sets were also manufactured, formed into 8 car sets.\n\nRetirements began in the 1990s, with all 101 series sets retired by 2010 and all 301 series sets by 2012. Only eight New 101 series sets remain in service on the Seibu network, with the rest either having been scrapped or resold to other private railroads; the Chichibu Railway, Joshin Electric Railway, RyÅ«tetsu, Izuhakone Railway, Sangi Railway and Ohmi Railway all received 101 series sets for use. 3 cars have been preserved in various places; KuHa 1150 has been converted into a library and is located in Higashimurayama in Tokyo, KuHa 1224 is preserved at Seibu's Yokose Depot and KuHa 1262 is located outside the Seibu Dome in Tokorozawa.\n\nDesign[]\n\nThe 101 series sets use a curved front end with mid-mounted headlights in circular casings protruding slightly from the body. The bodies are painted yellow with silver accents. Both the 2000 and New 2000 series sets feature slight differences in their front fascias.\n\nCab variations[]\n\nSpecifications[]\n\nConstruction is of steel; the sets feature unpainted stainless steel doors. The sets use resistor-controlled traction systems."
