        "text": "Shinjuku Station, in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo, is often called the busiest train station in the world, serving more than 3.5 million passengers every day. It is also one of the most difficult to navigate due to the many train lines the station serves and due to the many department stores, retail outlets and restaurants it houses.\n\nSeibu Shinjuku Station on the other hand is not part of Shinjuku Station. It is a separate train station all on its own about 500 meters north of Shinjuku Station.\n\nSeibu Shinjuku Station serves only one private railway company, Seibu Railways. Navigation is easy here even though the station complex serves multiple purposes.\n\nWhen walking from Shinjuku Station, Seibu Shinjuku Station is easy to spot due to the iconic tall and narrow Prince Hotel built right on top of the main station building. The Prince Hotel chain belongs to the Seibu Railway Company.\n\nThe south / main entrance to the station is from Yasukuni Dori Avenue, the wide road separating the vicinity of Shinjuku Station from its northern environs.\n\nTo reach the train station area on the second floor of the building, you have to pass through a part of the Pepe department store occupying the southern part of the building.\n\nIf you take the escalator up, you walk by a number of cake shops before you get to the station area. Though there are never any lines at any of the cake shops, they must do brisk business since a good part of the daily 175,000 passengers using the station walk by them, many on daily commutes.\n\nTrain Lines\n\nSeibu Shinjuku Station is the terminus of the Seibu Shinjuku Line, running to Hon Kawagoe Station in Kawagoe in Saitama Prefecture.\n\nAt Kodaira Station, about halfway to Hon Kawagoe, the Haijima Line branches off from the Seibu Shinjuku Line and takes its separate course to Haijima Station in Akishima City, north of Tachikawa.\n\nTrains in both directions start out of Seibu Shinjuku Station.\n\nSome trains cover only parts of the lines. There are trains destined for Tanashi (covering both lines) and for Tamagawa Josui Station in direction Haijima (linking at Tamagawa Josui to the Tama Toshi Monorail).\n\nThere are also trains bound for Shin Tokorozawa in the direction of Hon Kawagoe. While Shin Tokorozawa might not be much of a popular destination, those trains do get you to Tokorozawa Station in Tokorozawa where you can transfer to the Seibu Ikebukuro Line which provides a convenient connection to the scenic Chichibu area.\n\nKawagoe Trains\n\nThe Seibu Railway Company heavily advertises Koedo, the scenic and historic center of Kawagoe city in Saitama at Seibu Shinjuku Station. Indeed, Koedo is definitely worth a day trip. The Seibu Shinjuku Line provides the fastest service and most convenient connection there from Shinjuku.\n\nStation Layout\n\nSeibu Shinjuku Station features three tracks on three platforms. All major facilities are located close to the South Exit which serves as the main gateway towards Shinjuku Station.\n\nThe North Exit of the station is rather small and usually unmanned. It is not very frequented but if you plan to walk towards the lively and nearby Okubo neighborhood that would be the exit to take.\n\nStation Environs\n\nSeibu Shinjuku Station is located right next to the Kabukicho entertainment district. Kabukicho used to be a famously raunchy red light district up until the mid-2000's but has been thoroughly cleaned up since then.\n\nThe street stretching along the whole expanse of Seibu Shinjuku Station on its eastern side used to be called American Boulevard. It used to be home to some cheap but very convenient capsule hotels and a great number of \"Philippine Clubs\" and the like, all of them more or less fronts for prostitution outlets. Girls in heavy make-up accosted passers-by right on the street late at night, sometimes aggressively so.\n\nToday, hardly any trace of those times is left. American Boulevard has been renamed Brick Street, the name drawing on the brick walls lining the exterior of the station. The street’s leafy sidewalks are home to a variety of restaurants, most notably the Russian Restaurant Sungari (www.sungari.jp, in Japanese).\n\nThe Yunika building with its multiple large video screens constantly playing music clips is right in front of the South Exit of Seibu Shinjuku Station.\n\nFrom outside the South Exit you also get a great view towards the Nishi Shinjuku skyscrapers.\n\nCrossing Yasukuni Dori Avenue on the right side of the train bridge towards Shinjuku Station will get you straight to the scenic drinking alleys of Omoide Yokocho."
