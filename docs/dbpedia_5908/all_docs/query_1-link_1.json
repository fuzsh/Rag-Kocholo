        "text": "The group has been spending on capital expenditure to maintain a safe and secure railroad transportation—our greatest mission. Among measures to improve passenger safety, Seibu Railway has installed platform screen doors with barrier-free fee and a fall detection sensor as well as removing crossings by grade-separation, improvement of slopes, protection against falling rocks, and prevention of elevated bridge railings from falling off for surveillance.\n\nIn addition ,introducing in-train cameras and outward-facing cameras for some train. In addition, we, as an infrastructure operator, have implemented cyber security measures and so forth. Meanwhile, Seibu Bus, Seibu Kanko Bus, and Izuhakone Bus have adopted advanced safety vehicles and Seibu Hire, a limo service operator, Izuhakone Kotsu and Ohmi Taxi have adopted Toyota’s JPN Taxi, known for its an updated look and modern features including safety equipment.\n\nFor more details on these initiatives, please refer to the websites of each Group company in the Group company Initiatives section as below (in Japanese only).\n\nSeibu Realty Solutions operates large commercial buildings and shopping centers such as DaiyaGate Ikebukuro, Tokyo Garden Terrace Kioicho, and Grand Emio Tokorozawa. To prepare for a major earthquake or other large-scale disasters, those buildings have stockpiled emergency supplies, installed backup emergency power generators, and designated spaces as emergency shelters for employees and customers who are unable to return home after a disaster. Tokyo Garden Terrace Kioicho is in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward, and the company has concluded an agreement with the ward's government to cooperate in the event of a major disaster. DaiyaGate Ikebukuro also agreed with Tokyo's Toshima Ward to help people who are stranded in the area due to a disaster.\n\nDaiyaGate provides safety and security with superior earthquake resistance and dependable energy supply system during disasters and creates a healthy and comfortable office environment by providing thermal environments.\n\nIn addition, Seibu Bus has concluded an \"Agreement on Electric Power Supply by EV Buses in Times of Disaster\" with Niiza City and an \"Agreement on Transportation in Times of Disaster\" with Kodaira City.\n\nIn recognition of these and other features, the building was given CASBEE for Smart Wellness Office Rank S certification, the highest rank in the CASBEE for Smart Wellness Office certification system.\n\nPrince Hotels also stocked up on emergency supplies and handed out employees an emergency handbook that explains how to direct and assist guests at the time of a disaster, as well as procedures for ensuring safety of all people onsite.\n\nWhile Japan is a relatively safe country, it is home to numerous organized crime syndicates. All companies of the Group are resolutely opposed to these organizations and prohibit any conduct that could be associated with their activities. The Group Code of Conduct also prohibits any relations with such criminal organizations.\n\nIn addition, the Group companies that own and operate pools and spa facilities strictly prohibit entry of people with tattoos, which are a visual hallmark of organized crime syndicates in Japan, in order to ensure the safety and comfort of customers."
