        "text": "Trains in Japan: First-Timer’s Guide to Japan’s Rail Network\n\nTrains in Japan and How to Travel Japan’s Rail Network\n\nBrimming with amazing eats, iconic landmarks, sensational views, and (so much) more, a trip to Japan promises a life-changing experience and an abundance of adventures. ⛩️ If it’s your first time in Japan, you might be a little worried about how to navigate the transportation system in Japan (especially if you don’t speak Japanese). Fret not, we are here with a first-timer’s guide on how to get around Japan by train! 🚉\n\nBefore we begin, here’s a quick #KlookTip - Download the app Japan Travel by Navitime! If you plan to travel a lot via trains and buses, this app will give you the best route recommendations. You can also select which JR Pass you have for it to show you options that are covered by your pass. 📱 [Apple Store | Google Play]\n\nMore Japan Travel Tips\n\nMore to love in Japan\n\nHow to Use Trains in Japan\n\nJapan is renowned for its extremely efficient transportation system, particularly its extensive rail network. 🚂With multiple lines connecting various cities and neighborhoods, navigating the trains in Japan can understandably get quite confusing. Let us untangle that a bit for you!\n\nFirstly, it’s important to note that the railway lines in Japan are not operated by a single company. Simply put, JR aka Japan Railways Group is the main railway network in Japan, owning about 80% of the country’s railroads (where your JR Pass comes into play). The remaining 20% is served by dozens of other private railway companies, especially in and around metropolitan areas.🏙️\n\nTypes of Trains in Japan\n\nNext, there are different types of trains in Japan. Different trains suit different needs - for example, the bullet train is the fastest transportation between cities and stops at major city stations (eg. Tokyo Station to Shin Osaka Station).🚅 If you plan to explore a certain area in a particular city instead, you can hop onboard a local train that stops at every station.\n\nHere’s a quick summary of the various types of trains in Japan:\n\nFind out more details here:\n\nJapan Train Ticket Types\n\nSince there are various trains in Japan, you would need to buy different train tickets depending on what kind of train you are looking to take.🎫\n\nHere’s a quick overview of what’s available:\n\nIntroduction to Travelling on Japan Railways (JR)\n\nFirstly, you would’ve probably heard the benefits of getting a JR Pass for your Japan travels - but what is a JR pass and how does it help exactly? 🤔\n\nTo put it simply, the Whole Japan JR Pass:\n\n✔️ Allows tourists unlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) Shinkansen, trains, buses, and ferry services across the country\n\n✔️ Is available in 7, 14, or 21-day validity depending on the duration of your trip\n\n✔️ Price starts from PHP11,505 for 7-day pass\n\n✔️ Is best if you plan to explore many different cities in Japan\n\nThere are also Regional JR Passes, that offer:\n\n✔️ Unlimited travel on all Japan Railways Group (JR) transportation - different passes cover different types of transport (trains, buses, ferry, etc) in a specific area or region; Check what’s included in your pass before you purchase!\n\n✔️ Depending on the pass, different durations and flexible days are available\n\n✔️ Price depends on the location selected\n\n✔️ Is best if you only have plans to explore a specific area or specific cities as you can save more money on a regional pass rather than a Whole Japan pass\n\nFor more details on what a JR Pass covers, how much, and which pass you should get, check out this guide:\n\nBeyond JR: Privately Owned Rail Companies\n\nAs mentioned earlier, other privately-owned rail companies play a significant role in transportation in Japan. Private railways often handle intercity travel, airport connections, and particular regional destinations not covered by the Japan Rail Pass. These companies often also operate local bus networks, hotels, and attractions.\n\nIf you intend to explore a certain area in Japan instead of traveling from city to city, you’ll be pleased to know that most transportation companies also offer special city passes that are great for your adventures! 😁 We’ll share more about the popular ones for tourists (according to city) in greater detail below!\n\nGetting Around Tokyo\n\nHome to big city skylines, mammoth shopping streets, tasty eats and iconic attractions like Tokyo Disneyland, SHIBUYA SKY, and more, Tokyo is a must-visit destination for every first-timer to Japan. 🌟\n\nCovering the whole city with almost 300 stations, Tokyo subway lines will help you get to almost any destination quickly and easily. For Tokyo, the major lines here are:\n\nJR\n\nTokyo Metro\n\nToei Lines\n\nOther lines serving Greater Tokyo\n\nFrom the Airport\n\nNarita Airport\n\n🚝 Keisei Main Line or JR Narita Express\n\nKeisei Main Line\n\nNarita International Airport is the main airport for Tokyo. Here you can take the Keisei Skyliner on the Keisei Main Line to get you to Tokyo’s Keisei-Ueno station. Take a short 3-min walk and you will get to Ueno Station where you can start using your JR Pass.\n\nJR Narita Express\n\nThe Narita Express \"N'EX\" is a limited express train that directly connects Narita International Airport with major cities and districts including Tokyo, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Yokohama. This option is covered by JR Pass.\n\nHaneda Airport\n\n🚝 Keikyu Kuko Line (Keikyu Airport Line) or Tokyo Monorail\n\nKeikyu Airport Line\n\nKeikyu Airport Line is a private railway line that connects Haneda Airport to Keikyu Main Line, so you can get to Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama.\n\nTokyo Monorail\n\nThe other rail option from Haneda Airport to Tokyo International Airport is the Tokyo Monorail which is included in the JR Pass.
