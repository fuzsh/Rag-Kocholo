        "text": "Japan has an extensive public transportation network that includes trains, subways, buses, and taxis. The trains are the most popular mode of transportation, and they are clean, safe, and efficient. The Shinkansen or bullet train is the fastest way to travel between cities, while local trains and subways are best for getting around within a city. To navigate Japan’s train system, familiarize yourself with the rail line map before purchasing a ticket. Most kiosks have a button in the corner that allows you to switch to English.\n\nIf you plan to travel around Japan by train, getting a Japan Rail Pass can save you a lot of money. The pass allows unlimited travel on most JR trains, including the Shinkansen, for a set number of days. It can only be purchased outside of Japan. For places like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, use the various Japan metro networks to get around each city on arrival and when sightseeing. While Japan Rail trains help visitors travel around Japan, their use is much more limited once you get into the big cities.\n\nPublic transport in Japan is almost always exceptionally clean and well-maintained. It’s also very efficient; it’s exceptionally rare for a train or subway not to run on time. When using public transportation in Japan, it’s important to know the different companies and lines. Read the metro station signs carefully and understand how to purchase tickets at kiosks. Buses are also an option for budget travelers as they’re significantly cheaper than bullet trains but slower.\n\nIn summary, familiarize yourself with Japan’s extensive public transportation network that includes trains, subways, buses and taxis. Use local trains or subways when getting around within a city and bullet trains when traveling between cities. Get a Japan Rail Pass if you plan to travel around Japan by train. Know how to read metro station signs carefully before purchasing tickets at kiosks. Finally, remember that public transport in Japan is almost always exceptionally clean and well-maintained while being very efficient.\n\nJapan Railway Train\n\nJapan has an extensive and reliable network of railways that covers its four major islands — Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. The Japan Railways Group (JR Group) is the successor of the Japanese National Railways (JNR), which were privatized in 1987. The JR Group operates almost all intercity rail services and a large proportion of commuter rail services. It is made up of six regional passenger railway companies: JR Hokkaido, JR East, JR Central, JR West, JR Shikoku, and JR Kyushu. There is also one nationwide freight railway company called JR Freight.\n\nIn addition to the JR Group, there are dozens of smaller private railway companies in Japan. Some operate just a single line while others operate extensive networks. The major private railway companies include Keisei and Seibu. Keisei operates a mainline and several branch lines from Tokyo to Chiba Prefecture. It provides access to Narita Airport for tourists. Seibu operates a network of suburban railway lines west of central Tokyo. It provides access to Chichibu for tourists.\n\nThere are five types of trains in Japan: Shinkansen (bullet trains), limited express trains, express trains, rapid trains, and local trains. The Shinkansen is the fastest type of train in Japan. Limited express trains cover more destinations than Shinkansen but are not as fast. Express trains typically cost more than local or rapid trains but get passengers to their destination quicker.\n\nTourists should consider purchasing a Japan Rail Pass if they plan on traveling extensively by train during their stay in Japan. This pass offers unlimited rides within a specific time period and is only available to international tourists with proof of foreign passport.\n\n2. Subways\n\nThe subway system in Japan is a clean, safe, and efficient way to travel around the country’s major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. There are two subway train line operators in Tokyo: Tokyo Metro Co. and Toei transportation. Tokyo Metro is privately owned and operates nine train lines, while Toei is operated by the local government and operates four train lines. The two subway systems are interlinked, so passengers can easily transfer between them.\n\nThe Tokyo Metro provides nine train lines covering 195 km of track between 179 stations, making it the largest operator of subway train lines in Tokyo. On average, over eight million passengers use the combined subway network of the Tokyo and Toei metros daily. The most useful train line in Tokyo is the JR Yamanote Line, which is commonly called the “Tokyo Loop Line” or just “Loop Line”.\n\nTo use the subway system in Japan, tourists can buy a one-way fare ticket from multilingual ticket machines at every station or use a rechargeable IC card to swipe in and out of the ticket gates. For economical travel, tourists can research one-day or two-day passes that will allow them to ride unlimited trains within a certain area for a fixed price.\n\nIt’s important to note that changing lines on subways can be expensive, so it’s best to check maps closely to see which train lines you can access your destination from. Rush hour on the Tokyo subway system can be very crowded, so it’s best to avoid traveling during peak times if possible.\n\n3. Buses\n\nBuses in Japan serve as a secondary means of public transportation, complementing the train and subway networks in Tokyo, Osaka, and some other large cities. In cities with less dense train networks like Kyoto, buses are the main means of public transportation. Buses also serve smaller towns, the countryside, and national parks. There are several types of bus services: route buses (which go within cities or towns), highway buses (which often go between large cities), and limousine buses.\n\nUsing a Pasmo card is easiest for getting on and off the bus when traveling in the greater Tokyo/Yokohama region. Loading your card up with at least ￥3,000 (~$30) should cover several rides in most cases. Using a Pasmo on a bus is similar to using one at the train station: simply tap the card when boarding and exiting. Some bus companies do a good job at providing English signs.\n\nIt can be intimidating to use buses in Japan because there are different ticketing systems depending on the company, and recognizing the stop that you want to get off can be challenging. It is also a good idea to take a photo of the bus schedule so that you will know when you’ll need to return to the stop. In certain areas, buses may not come as frequently as they do in Tokyo. Also note that buses and trains in Japan typically operate on two different schedules: a weekday (平日) schedule and a weekend/holiday (土日祝) schedule.\n\nIn addition to buses, Japan’s transport sector stands out for its energy efficiency: it uses less energy per person than any other country except Denmark. Most of Japan’s major cities are connected by a high-speed bullet train network known as Shinkansen that is run by the Japan Railways Group (JR Group). The JR Pass offers unlimited rides on most of the Shinkansen lines and JR-operated trains, buses, and ferries across Japan for 7, 14 or 21 days.\n\n4. Taxis\n\nTaxis are a quick and easy way to get around Japan, especially in major cities where they are readily available. Taxis in Japan are usually very clean, and the level of service is high. The fares are calculated by distance on the meter, with the exception of certain fixed-rate routes to airports and major sightseeing destinations. The price of a taxi varies by location, but fares can be expensive compared to other modes of transportation.\n\nTo use a taxi in Japan, look for signs in front of taxis that show if they are available. These signs are usually displayed in Japanese but are color-coded. Red means the taxi can pick up passengers, while green means it is occupied. Doors open and close automatically, so don’t try to handle them yourself as you enter and exit. When paying in cash, try to avoid paying small amounts with large bills. Tipping is not done in Japan.\n\nIn Tokyo, taxis start at 410 yen (ca. 3.71 USD) for the first 1,052 kilometers. Most taxis accept payment by credit card as well as cash — just look out for the payment method sticker located on the taxi window. There is also a Japan Taxi App that makes it easier to order taxis and pre-arrange rides.\n\nWhile public transportation tends to be more convenient than taxis in larger cities like Tokyo, taking a taxi can be an economical option for shorter rides or when traveling in groups of three or more people. In smaller cities or rural areas where public transportation may be less convenient, taking a taxi from the nearest train station to your destination can be a good alternative.\n\nTips and Trick!\n\nJapan has an extensive public transportation network that includes trains, buses, and ferries. The train system is the most efficient way to get around Japan, especially if you have a Japan Rail Pass. The pass allows unlimited travel on JR trains for a set period and can be purchased before arriving in Japan. If you only have a week or so in Japan and want to get around quickly, getting a rail pass and taking the train everywhere you need to go is the best option.\n\nBuses are another budget-friendly option for long-distance travel in Japan. They connect the islands of Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshū. Although they are not as fast as the shinkansen (bullet train), they are significantly cheaper. Buses also travel routes that trains don’t.\n\nFerries are an excellent way to see some of Japan’s iconic landmarks such as Mount Fuji and Miyajima’s floating torii gate. Ships can also take you to other islands with almost a Hawaiian feel to it.\n\nIf you plan on staying in one area of Japan, regional passes for private railways or JR operated lines might fit your trip better than a rail pass. You can buy regional passes for all prefectures except Okinawa. Some day passes sell for less than 2,000 yen (around US $18.50), and week-long ones go for about 10,000 yen (around US $92).\n\nIt’s easy to rent a car in Japan if you want to take a road trip through the countryside where public transportation is infrequent. Drivers must be 18-years-old or older and hold an International Driving Permit. Japanese taxi drivers are very honest but rarely speak English. If you think you might want to get a taxi back to the hotel later pick up the business card with Japanese directions."
