        "text": "“Experience Oriented Approach” involves using various tools and methods in creative discussions to identify potential issues. During meetings, for example, members use “Business Origami”—a tool for studying services from the perspective of stakeholders—while designers convert—on the spot—concepts brainstormed by meeting participants into actual pictures. Sharing concrete images like these let participants delve into deeper discussions. The result of this was the sharing among all project members of a visual image of station personnel receiving telephone communications and then rushing to the station platform carrying a wheelchair ramp, along with the strain that this imposes on them.\n\nAccording to Kozue Kano, a system engineer belonging to the Experience Oriented Approach Promotion Department of Hitachi, Ltd.'s Service Platform Business Division, \"An advantage of the Experience Oriented Approach workshop is having various stakeholders participate and exchange opinions. Also, in the carrying out of discussions that included presentations of cases from other companies that we had looked into, I sensed a response in terms of a broadening of width and depth in everyone's thinking.\"\n\nIn this project, Hitachi consolidated the contents of the several iterations of discussions carried out by each team. Hitachi then used this report as the basis for a study on what type of service all project members should put into practice using ICT. This resulted in a move toward developing the System for Assisting Wheelchair User Guidance Operations, which targets wheelchair users and the station personnel who provide their assistance.\n\nResponding to the decision to develop this system, Hitachi set about identifying essential problems and latent needs by investigating the behavioral culture of the people working on-site and making detailed on-site observations of the situation of people at work. In addition to the carrying out of station personnel interviews and at-work observations, new issues in systemization were discovered by gaining an understanding of the work situation and by identifying issues while making drawings of the workflow of station personnel.\n\nFor example, even given that the information needed for passenger guidance from the boarding station to the deboarding station is communicated by telephone or handwritten memo, at stations with a large staff, the task may be handed over to someone other than the person that received the communication. However, at stations with less staff, the person that received the telephone call is often the one that takes charge of the guidance. This shows how the operational situation of communications work varies by station size.\n\nTo improve this situation, the tablet-based GS System (Guidance for Customer Support system) was introduced. With this system, station personnel at the boarding station enter into a tablet the guidance information necessary for the wheelchair or white-cane user. This information is then immediately sent to the tablet of the personnel at the deboarding station.\n\nThe interface design done by Hitachi also gives consideration to the potential presence of older station personnel by including such functionality as entry of items by simply pressing display buttons. Other adaptations include the changing of the background color in accordance with response status and the sounding of alarms upon the receipt of new guidance events and train arrivals. These and other features represent the various strategies incorporated into the system for reducing both the load on station personnel and human error. The system has received high praise from those that have actually used the system, commenting that \"it is easy to use and convenient\" and that \"it is no longer possible to go back to telephone communication or handwritten memos, like before.\""
