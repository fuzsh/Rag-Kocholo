        "text": "Overground Trains\n\nThe overground rail network in Tokyo is mostly operated by JR East. There are also around seven other private companies operating lines within the city, and linking the city to other prefectures. At stations with lines of more than one company, each company’s lines will typically have its own ticket gates. Transferring between two companies’ rail lines (including the subways) usually means paying a separate fare for each stage of the journey. Where possible, it is cheapest to stick to a single company’s lines for each journey.\n\nYou will find that some trains transfer from one line to another, and in some cases between companies, along a single route. An example is the Tobu Tojo Line, which may transfer to Tokyo Metro’s Fukutoshin Line, then to the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line before finally becoming the Minatomirai Line.\n\nStation names are written in kanji, hiragana, and English. Train announcements are made in Japanese and English on major lines.\n\nJR\n\nJR has more lines in Tokyo than any other company. The center of the system is the Yamanote Line, which loops around the city and links to all the major stations. The Chuo Line cuts across the Yamanote “loop” between Shinjuku and Tokyo stations. Other major lines include the Saikyo line, which links Tokyo with Saitama Prefecture, the Keihin-Tōhoku line, linking Saitama and Yokohama through central Tokyo, and the Keiyō Line, which links Tokyo with Chiba Prefecture and the Tokyo Disney Resorts.\n\nJR East (East Japan Railway Company)\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/e/\n\nJR East Infoline\n\nhttps://www.jreast.co.jp/e/customer_support/infoline.html\n\nTel: 050-2016-1603 / 10:00am-6:00pm\n\nPrivate rail\n\nKeio\n\n— has six lines in the Tokyo Metropolitan area.

The Enoshima Line reached to Enoshima. It is connected to the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line.\n\nhttps://www.odakyu.jp/english/transport/\n\nSeibu\n\n— has a number of lines and branches, including the Seibu Shinjuku line, linking Shinjuku and Saitama, and the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, linking Ikebukuro and Saitama. The Seibu Ikebukuro Line is connected to the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line and the Fukutoshin Line, and is also directly connected to the Tokyu Toyoko Line and the Minatomirai Line via the Fukutoshin Line.\n\nhttps://www.seiburailway.jp/railways/tourist/english/\n\nTōkyū\n\n— has seven lines in Tokyo, including the Tōyoko line, linking Shibuya and Yokohama, the Den-en-toshi Line, linking Shibuya and Yamato in Kanagawa, and connect to Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line.

Faster trains will skip some stations, so make sure the train you ride will stop at your destination. To speed up your trip, take a rapid or express train until the last stop before your destination, and then transfer to a local train."
