Overview\n\nThese guidelines are required to be followed by developers when developing applications using public transportation-related data (\"public transportation data\") obtained through the Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo API (\"API\"). These provide API specification rules, which are not defined in the Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo Permission Rules (\"Permission Rules\"). Developers must read the Permission Rules and API Specification and follow the rules below.\n\n2. Implementation Rules\n\n2.1. Access Token\n\nDo not publish the access token to third parties. When you publish a sample code to a third party in particular, do not include the access token in the code. (Example: Take appropriate action, such as replacing the token with acl:consumerKey=ACL_CONSUMERKEY.)\n\n2.2. Dynamic Data\n\nDynamic data, such as train location information, train status information, bus location information, and real-time arrival/departure information, change as time goes by. Displaying old information may mislead or confuse application users. To prevent this, observe the following.\n\n2.2.1. Displaying Time\n\nWhen you show dynamic data or data generated from dynamic data to users, display the data generation time information (dc:date) obtained through the API on the screen.\n\n2.2.2. Displaying Latest Information\n\nWhen you show dynamic data or data generated from dynamic data to users, display information as fresh as possible. To help you display the latest information, an API response includes an update interval and valid range. Update data on the screen at a time interval specified in odpt:frequency. Do not use data out of valid range (dct:valid). For dynamic data, do not display out-of-date data, such as data before an update.\n\n2.3. Static Data\n\nStatic data, which excludes dynamic data may be updated by traffic operators. Displaying old information may mislead or confuse application users. To prevent this, observe the following.\n\n2.3.1. Displaying Obtained Date and Time\n\nWhen you show static data or data generated from static data to users, display the obtained date and time on an area of the screen where application users can easily access.\n\n2.3.2. Updating Periodically\n\nWhen you show static data or data generated from static data to users, update the data periodically by obtaining the latest one through the API. Unless otherwise provided in the specific terms of use, the data must be updated within one week after the Public Transportation Open Data Center notifies you of a data update.\n\n2.4. Notification to your users\n\nPlease make sure to notify your users of the following when you make available your application(s) that use the data provided for the Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo.\n\nThe source of the data in this app is the Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo.\n\nThe accuracy and integrity of the data in this app shall not be guaranteed.\n\nPlease provide the email address of the developer for inquiries on the app, so your user(s) will not contact the public transportation operators directly.\n\nE.g.\n\n----\n\nThe source of the public transportation data in this app, etc. is the Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo.\n\nThey are based on the data provided by the public transportation operators. The accuracy and integrity of the data are not guaranteed. Please do not contact the public transportation operators directly regarding the content of the app.\n\nFor inquiries on the app, please contact the following email address.\n\n[E-mail address of the developer]\n\n----\n\n2.5. Using Logo and Railway Line Colors\n\nWhen you use logo or railway line colors of respective railway lines, do not modify them unless otherwise provided in the specific terms of use.\n\n2.6. Machine Translation\n\nWhen you provide machine-translated text, state that machine translation was used on an area of the screen where application users can easily access.\n\n3. Support\n\nFor any questions, refer to the documents in the Developers Site first. If you are unable to find an appropriate answer, post your question to the forum in the Developers site. The Secretariat Office will answer the posted question wherever possible. Please refrain from making a direct contact with the public transportation operators.\n\nDecember 7, 2017"
