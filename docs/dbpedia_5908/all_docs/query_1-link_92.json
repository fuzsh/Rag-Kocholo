        "text": "Kominato Railway K.K. (headquarters: Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture) is a local transportation service operator with a 100-year history in the Kazusa area of Chiba Prefecture. The company operates a railway that connects the 39.1 km between Goi Station and Kazusa-Nakano Station. It also operates a route bus business in Ichihara and Mobara and an express bus business that connects Tokyo with parts of Chiba Prefecture (e.g., Kisarazu, Sodegaura).\n\nTo address negative impacts from outflows of people to inner city areas and from the low-birth rate and the aging population, the company contributes to the maintenance and securing of modes of transportation within its business area that are indispensable for local residents, including seniors. This also includes providing community bus services in alliance with the local government and supplying courtesy cards (no-car cards) to seniors who surrender their licenses, qualifying them to use Kominato Railway bus services for half price.\n\nIn addition, the company also operates tourist spots along its lines, including Yoro Keikoku (valley) and the Chibanian geologic site. The company is also actively deploying activities that contribute to the improvement of the local brand, including working with the local community to convey to people inside and outside the area the diverse charm of the region as a tourist site. This includes the \"reverse\" development project in front of Yoro Keikoku Station (removal of asphalt pavement, planting of plants and trees) and, since 2017, the operation of a trolley train highlighting the satoyama (undeveloped woodland).\n\nDBJ is providing financial support for the indispensable role the company plays in the infrastructure in the Kazusa area in Chiba Prefecture, and for the further growth of the area as a tourist site, and to contribute to the revitalization of the regional economy."
