They are designed for 120 km/h operation on 1 067 mm gauge lines electrified at 1·5 kV DC.\n\nThe operator is also planning to reduce energy consumption and its carbon footprint by equipping its EMU fleets with VVVF inverter control systems\n\nIt also plans to increase network capacity by introducing communications-based train control, with the first tests planned for 2024."
