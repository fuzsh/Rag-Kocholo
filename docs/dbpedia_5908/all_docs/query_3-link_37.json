        "text": "LIVE BOARD,INC. will connect and link 26 screens of the Seibu Railway Ikebukuro Station Smile Station Vision (1st floor/B-1 area) installed on the 1st floor of Ikebukuro Station on the Seibu Railway Ikebukuro Line to the LIVE BOARD Marketplace*1 from June 24, 2024.\n\nIn addition to the conventional sales method of specifying the delivery period and frequency, NTT DOCOMO's location data and analysis technology will enable this digital media to develop a model to estimate the number of passengers and viewers in stations, and to sell impressions (VAC)*2 based on the number of people estimated to have actually seen the ad.\n\nIkebukuro Station is served by many train lines and is one of the world's top-ranked stations, with an average of more than 2 million passengers per day. The station is surrounded by department stores, electronics retail stores, and commercial facilities that are used by people of all ages. Seibu Railway Ikebukuro Station Smile Station Vision (1st floor/B-1 area) is located on the route leading from the ticket gates to the department stores and other lines, making it a location that appeals not only to users along the Seibu Line but also to those on other lines.\n\nLIVE BOARD will continue to create new value for the expansion of the DOOH market by implementing effective and efficient management of transportation advertising, and will further promote the realization of advertising delivery adapted to diverse lifestyles.\n\nï¼1 This refers to the entire DOOH advertising space (inventory) handled by LIVE BOARD, including its own and other companies'.\n\nï¼2 LIVE BOARD uses impressions that take into account the visibility rate based on visibility surveys (VAC = Visibility Adjusted Contact / total number of people who saw the ad), as recommended in the OOH Global Measurement Guidelines. Of the number of people in the viewing area of a medium (OTS = Opportunity to See), the number of people who may come into contact with an OOH ad (OTC = Opportunity to Contact / takes into account the direction of movement within the viewing area and the presence of obstacles) is defined. The number of people who are likely to actually see the advertisement (VAC) is estimated by adding the visibility rate for each media to this number.\n\nâSeibu Railway Ikebukuro Station Smile Station Vision (1st floor/B-1 area)\n\nThis large signage is located on the ground floor of Seibu Railway Ikebukuro Station, the busiest station on the Seibu Line, and can be broadcast on an 86-inch 4K LCD display, making it highly engaging.\n\nIt is expected to reach not only Seibu Line users but also users of other railways.\n\nEffective on: June 24, 2024\n\nDisplay location: Seibu Railway Ikebukuro Station, 1st floor above ground\n\nSize/number of sides: 86 inches / 15 sides, 70 inches / 11 sides\n\nDuration: 4:45-25:00 (20 hours 15 minutes)\n\nSound: Available\n\nâLIVE BOARD inventories across the nation\n\nCurrently LIVE BOARD has over 64,500 screens and continues to expand the network with not only its owned and operated, but also aggregating screens from partners across the nation.\n\nURLï¼liveboard.co.jp/en/screen/\n\nâAbout LIVE BOARD, INC.\n\nA digital OOH ad network operator achieving data driven targeting and effectiveness verification\n\nLIVE BOARD is the first company in Japan to achieve impression-based (VAC) advertisement delivery in OOH. We deploy advertisement delivery and billing systems in accordance with actual conditions that are based on the estimated number of viewers \"at that time, in that place, and for that specific ad,\" even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people's movement patterns are prone to change. In addition, by combining big data from Japan's largest carriers with our own network, which includes a wide range of digital OOH across Japan, including outdoor, indoor, train, and station OOH ads, we have been able to deliver personalized ads, such as targeting by gender and age, that was not possible with traditional OOH."
