        "text": "There is a common sight in Japan — so common that it becomes almost invisible. That sight is trains. They are everywhere and I use them on a daily basis. I’ve grown to love the convenience and reliability of the Japanese public transportation system. Let’s just say that the system back where I’m from is found… lacking.\n\nThere’s more to it than just getting around though. There is an obsession here with all things on tracks. There are toys, mascots, celebrations, and each line has its own distinctive cars. The Keihan line to Kyoto from Osaka has the nicest burgundy-colored cars in the country. My own personal favorite, though, is the futuristic Shinkansen, the so-called “bullet train.”\n\nIn an effort to stand out, some companies make really unique decisions. Wakayama has an entire cat-themed train, for instance, and their station master is a real live cat! Sometimes there are events as well. When Ikea opened a new location in Tokyo, they decorated an entire train line with Ikea furniture and had a party for all the riders.\n\nWhich brings us to the Seibu Railway Company’s latest bid for uniqueness amongst Japanese trains.\n\nThe goal? Make a train that appears invisible as it passes. The mirrored surfaces reflect the passing scenery allowing it to blend into the background, unnoticed, unobtrusive, but fulfilling the requests by so many.\n\nThe way this train is designed has a ring of familiarity to it. Living and working in Japan has brought a lot of lifestyle modifications, and one of them has been the process of slowly integrating into society. This isn’t a foreign place to me anymore; it’s my home. I’ve discovered and have been to places no tourist is ever going to go on a short trip (unless they ask me for some ideas, of course), and that makes me a little bit like Seibu’s new train. Planet Depos has people all over Asia that are invisible, integrated residents of the communities where we live. We can give advice and direction about all things local, while at the same time providing exceptional court reporting and related services for which Planet Depos is known.\n\nI’ve already ordered my mirrored suit."
