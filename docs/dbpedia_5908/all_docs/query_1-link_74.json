        "text": "Shinkansen ( bullet train ) is the fastest and the most convenient express train in Japan, and all stations are wheelchair accessible. Elevators on platforms are available for all passengers. Train car floors and platforms are almost level, but train doors are not so wide 71cm. The aisle width is 57cm. They have a wheelchair friendly coach (#11 of Tokaido Shinkansen), equipped with wider doors 101cm, spacious toilet, wheelchair space, and even a special private room. Wheelchair space and multipurpose room requires advance booking and additional fare for reserved seat. For short trips, you can save your money by staying on the deck area, which requires no seat reservation.\n\nreport \" On the Bullet Train with the Wheelchair \"\n\nMost stations have very good accessibility; elevators, almost no steps and gaps between platforms and train cars. You may have difficulty at times in finding elevators from the street, because terminal buildings have many entrances. Make sure you know your way at major stations and underground shopping centers, otherwise you can get lost when transferring trains. Also be careful of the crowd when using Tokyo Metro during morning and evening peak hours.\n\nWe find more non-step buses recently, but the number of such vehicles is still less than half of all the buses operating, and even less in country side areas. Although non^step buses are physically accessible by wheelchair, you may sometimes feel uncomfortable sensing rejection or non-welcoming atmosphere among drivers or other passengers. Japanese roads and streets are not wide enough to leave much space around the bus stop area, so you may sometimes find it difficult to board a bus. Also Japanese buses are not so big.\n\nLong distance buses are called highway bus or limousine bus in Japan, and they are the cheapest means of transportation. Many different bus operators form network among major cities. Unfortunately, buses are not wheelchair friendly because they only have stairs at the door, and there are no wheelchair accessible toilets inside. But still, if you request the front row seat, kind drivers and passengers will help you.The quality of the seats varies by fare they charge. Of course, you will get wider and more comfortable seats if you pay more.\n\nUnfortunately, taxi fare is not cheap in Japan. Most taxis are small sedan type cars, and in urban areas, many cars carry natural gas tanks in the trunk, leaving less space to load wheelchairs. Care taxi (welfare taxi) services, which you can board on your wheelchair, are available. They normally provide transportation service for elderly and disabled people in the local community, but can also be chartered for sightseeing purpose. This will be useful especially when you are traveling in a group or with your family.\n\nYou can also rent a car. If you are going to drive, be reminded that most cars are automatic, and not many manual cars are available. Also, there is basically no (or very limited) service for hand controllers. If someone in your group is going to drive, some car rental companies have cars with lifts. With this, you can go wherever you like.\n\nYou will not find any accessibility problems at airports. Most airports have bridges, so it is easy to board and disembark aircrafts. If you need any special assistance on a domestic flight, you can go and ask at the boarding counter. Free wheelchair rental service is available at all airports, and if necessary, airport staff will guide your way. Powered (electric) wheelchair passengers should consult the airline company in advance for special assistance. Low Cost Career \" Vanilla Airline \" and \" Jet Star\" are not kind for wheelchair users. They sometime refuse passenger who cannot walk up and down stairs in small airports. Discrimination still exists. We try to change this horrible situations."
