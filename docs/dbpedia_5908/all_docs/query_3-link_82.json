        "text": "The Tokorozawa Works was a locomotive factory owned by the Seibu Railway.\n\nOpened in 1947 by the Seibu Railway, the Tokorozawa Works was located adjacent to Tokorozawa Station on the Seibu Shinjuku and Ikebukuro Lines. Vehicle manufacture began in 1954, with the Tokorozawa Works manufacturing vehicles mainly for the Seibu Railway. In addition to the manufacture of trains, the Tokorozawa Works was also involved in the manufacture of other vehicles and machinery such as dump trucks, amusement park rides and gravel collecting machines, as well as servicing buses owned by Seibu Bus, a related company.\n\nUntil 1969, all of Seibu's rolling stock was manufactured at Tokorozawa. The manufacturing side of things at Tokorozawa was slowly scaled back from 1983; Tokorozawa's last known manufacturing work was the completion of five 9000 series trains in March 1999. Tokorozawa's last vehicle inspections were carried out in June 2000, with inspections subsequently moved to Musashigaoka Works and Tokorozawa closed. The building remained standing as of 2015, but some redevelopment work began around the area in 2018; it is not clear if the building remains.\n\nProducts[]\n\nLocomotive maintenance\n\nHeavy rail rolling stock"
