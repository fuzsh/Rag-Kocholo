        "text": "How to Use Tokyoâ€™s Public Transportation\n\nAn easy to understand, outlined guide on how to use Tokyoâ€™s public transportation.\n\nLast Updated April 8th, 2020\n\nTokyo has almost 14 million residents, so taking public transportation in Tokyo, Japan is the best way to get around the city. However, being that it is such a large city, Tokyoâ€™s public transportation system can be very confusing and overwhelming to visitors. Iâ€™ve put together an easy to follow, and detailed guide on how to get around Tokyo, and the best way to do so. And when I say detailed, I mean Iâ€™ve compiled all of my research into a succinct bullet point outline so that you can easily understand everything and get the most juice out of the lemon (is that a real phrase, or did I just make it up?)\n\nTrust me when I suggest that you read through this slowly. Jot down your own notes & reference multiple maps while reading, so that you can feel comfortable with getting around when you arrive in Tokyo. Taking public transportation is much cheaper than paying for an uber or taxi, since the city is so large, and it gives you an excellent opportunity to truly experience Japanâ€™s unique culture.\n\n*PLEASE note that bus transportation is not included in this guide. We found prices to be similar from bus to train to subway, and felt that train and subway lines are more reliable and time efficient.\n\nThings to Know about Tokyo, Japanâ€™s Public Transportation System:\n\nTokyoâ€™s size requires anyone to utilize their very efficient public transportation\n\nJapanâ€™s public transport is ALWAYS on time\n\nEverything is clean. From the actual train cars to the walkways, to the restrooms. In fact, the public restrooms at the stations were comparable to nice hotel restrooms. As with most of Tokyo, there are few trash cans available.\n\nEfficiency is the focus. With more than 13 million people in one city, efficiency is necessary for Tokyoâ€™s public transportation. There are arrows showing which side of walkways to walk on and where to line up for each car. What would be chaotic elsewhere is systematic order here.\n\nTokyoâ€™s public transportation is very safe. The etiquette on Tokyoâ€™s public transportation is to not give direct eye contact and to keep to yourself. Not once did I ever slightly feel uncomfortable or that there were pickpockets. *however, still always protect your belongings\n\nItâ€™s easy to use, but can be quite confusing to a visitor due to the number of transit lines.\n\nVending machines are in every station. They have a plethora of unique drinks you can get. *Keep in mind the amount of plastic that comes from these machines, if you want to try something be selective to limit your plastic purchases please.\n\nThere are two types of Tokyo public transportation cards you can purchase. The Suica & the Pasmo, more details on these below\n\nIf lost, someone may come up to help you and you can always ask an official inside. We found that the Japanese were very kind and helpful when we seemed lost and confused.\n\nThe JR East & subway lines are the most convenient (see below)\n\nPlan your trip to Tokyo with this four day itinerary\n\nTrains in Tokyo\n\nYou can use a Travel card (Suica or Pasmo) or a JR rail pass on Tokyoâ€™s trains. These allow commuters to hop on/off buses and navigate stations relatively stress free. I would recommend using one of these cards throughout your stay as it will eliminate the need to purchase a ticket for each ride. Whichever you choose, know that Tokyoâ€™s trains are very economical & convenient for travelers\n\nHere are details on the train types available in Tokyo:\n\nJR = Japan Rail, this rail system covers the entire country of Japan (this JR term will be referred to a lot in this post)\n\nJR East is a group of lines. It includes Tokyo so will be seen most often in the city\n\nJR Yamanote Line- one of the JR East lines, this train service does a circular loop of all of Tokyoâ€™s main spots & runs until 1:20am\n\nSix major stations on this line:\n\nTokyo\n\nUeno\n\nIkebukuro\n\nShinjuku\n\nShibuya\n\nShinagawa\n\nOther JR Lines that you might use frequently in Tokyo are:\n\nKeihin-Tohoku Line: runs parallel to the Yamanote Lineâ€™s eastern half\n\n(blue)\n\nSaikyo Line: runs parallel to the Yamanote Line on the western half\n\n(dark green, light blue)\n\nChuo/Sobu Line (local): runs across the Yamanote circle, this is a local, slow service\n\n(Yellow, slow local)\n\nChuo Line (rapid): runs across the Yamanote circle, a rapid service. Connects the Tokyo Station with Shinjuku Stations\n\n(Orange, rapid)\n\nShinkansen: known as â€˜bullet trainsâ€™. The Tokaido Shinknason trains stop at Tokyo & Shinagawa, and bullet trains north stop at Tokyo & Ueno\n\nShinkansen, or high speed bullet train, tickets can be purchased from the JR stations\n\nMaps of the Shinknason trains cover the entirety of Japan, so to avoid confusion none are included in here. If you are interested in the bullet trains, check out this guide here\n\nThe Narita Express is a JR East train line\n\nNarita Express is the train line that takes you from the Narita Airport into Tokyoâ€™s city center\n\nThere are private railway companies\n\nThey connect Tokyoâ€™s center with outer regions & surrounding prefectures\n\nThe private railways typically start at a JR Yamanote Line\n\nHere are some of the private railway companies\n\nKeio\n\nOdakyu\n\nSeibu\n\nTokyu\n\nKeikyu\n\nKeisei\n\nTobu\n\nBefore you visit! Learn about Japanese Culture here.\n\nNow that weâ€™ve covered above ground trains, letâ€™s move onto\n\nTokyoâ€™s SUBWAYS\n\nThere are 13 subway lines\n\nOperated by two companies\n\nToei (4 lines) & Tokyo Metro (9 lines)\n\nThey run mostly inside of the JR Yamanote Line (remember the JR Yamanote Line is the circular/loop line that stops at many major Tokyo stops)\n\nClick here to see Tokyo Metroâ€™s Subway Map\n\nTickets & Passes for Tokyoâ€™s Subways and Trains\n\nTokyo Travel cards\n\nTokyoâ€™s travel cards give you unlimited access to any subway or train line\n\nThey donâ€™t discount the cost per ride, but they do save you a lot of time from having to buy a ticket each time you want to go somewhere; i.e. youâ€™d have to find the ticket booth, stand in line, etc (each station is different so finding the ticket area would take you time)\n\nEach area/prefecture of Japan has their own travel card. The most used and acceptable in Tokyo are the Suica and Pasmo cards. What is the difference between a Suica and a Pasmo card? See below!\n\nSuica: purchased at JR lines\n\nTravelers can purchase Suica cards from any JR station ticket machine or convenience stores\n\nIt is a prepaid fare card\n\nA 500 yen (about $5) deposit is required, and can be refunded when the card is returned\n\nSuica cards are accepted all over Japan- almost all buses, trains, convenience stores, vending machines\n\nOnce charged up with money the Suica card can be used immediately\n\nPasmo: purchased at non-JR lines/local lines (subway & bus lines)\n\nPasmo cards are used the same way as Suica cards, they are just provided by a different company\n\nPasmo cards are only accepted within Tokyo\n\nPasmo cards can be purchased from either airport, rail & subway stations\n\nA 500 yen deposit is also required, and can be refunded when the card is returned.\n\nKeep in mind, that the Pasmo card is only available to be used within Tokyo, so be sure to return the card for your deposit while you are within the city of Tokyo\n\nShould you choose a Suica or Pasmo card?\n\nThis seems to be a matter of preference to each person & where they will be traveling within the country\n\nHow to use your travel cards:\n\nSimply touch your travel card over the entrance scanner to the station\n\nThe scanners will beep if you do not have enough money charged onto the card, so each station has kiosks where you can purchase and re-charge your cards\n\nDay passes are available but not very convenient\n\nThey donâ€™t cover all of the different lines & all seem to be overpriced\n\nAnd if youâ€™re exploring over a few days youâ€™ll end up taking different lines of transportation around, so its more economical to purchase a travel card\n\nJapan Rail Pass\n\nThis is useful if you are exploring large parts of Japan, outside of Tokyo\n\nIf traveling outside of Tokyo, I would suggest purchasing the Japan Rail Pass only for the days that you are not in Tokyo, and using the travel cards, which are cheaper, for when you are in Tokyo\n\nRegional Passes\n\nJR Tokyo Wide Pass: good for getting to Tokyo Disneyland and Mt. Fuji\n\nYou can only purchase a regional pass in person at either of Tokyoâ€™s airports or the main train stations\n\nKnow that each region of Japan has its own travel pass, or IC card (Tokyoâ€™s are Suica & Pasmo)\n\nTips for using Tokyoâ€™s Public Transportation:\n\nThe faster, bullet trains, also known as Shinkansen, require separate tickets. Meaning you cannot use your Travel (Suica or Pasmo) cards for the bullet trains\n\nReturn your travel card at the end of your visit at any station relevant to your card\n\nSuica: JR lines\n\nPasmo: non-JR lines\n\nWith 13 million people in one city, rush hour will be packed; if possible, avoid traveling from 7:30-9am\n\nMany lines run from 5am-1am\n\nThere are women only cars during rush hours (children 6th grade & younger are allowed), typically towards the front of the train\n\nUse your mobile device to help you navigate. Google Maps was on point with their directions using Tokyoâ€™s trains and subways. The app will show you the number of stops, which exit of the station to take & the direction to walk towards\n\nHi!
