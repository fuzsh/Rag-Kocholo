        "text": "Two decades ago Erich Mende started buying political prisoners from East Germany. He wanted it kept secret.\n\nAt the time, he went around to the offices of West Germany's main magazines, newspapers and television stations to explain the delicate nature of the transactions and to ask them to maintain silence.\n\n''We had the hope then to get a few thousand'' prisoners, said the silver- haired Mr. Mende, who was then Deputy Chancellor and Minister for German Relations. ''But only if it remained secret. A clause in our agreement with East Berlin said that any publicity would mean the end of it.''\n\nMr. Mende's entreaties were effective. Even when one of the liberated political prisoners broke an oath of silence and tried to sell his story to West German publications, he was rebuffed by the editors.\n\nThe methods of winning the liberation of political prisoners in East Germany have become more sophisticated since 1963, when Ludwig Rehlinger, a Bonn official, nervously delivered an envelope containing 180,000 West German marks in a Berlin subway as the down payment on the first consignment of eight inmates. The process is now a big, institutionalized business for East Germany, and West German payments in raw materials like oil and copper are said to be taken into account in the Communists' five- year plans. Surrounded by Silence\n\nBut there is still little publicity. With occasional exceptions that do little more than confirm the rule, West German politicians and the press shrink from debating the ethical and even strategic implications of what is going on. What is literally the selling of East Germans to West Germany is enveloped in secrecy, myth and silence.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
