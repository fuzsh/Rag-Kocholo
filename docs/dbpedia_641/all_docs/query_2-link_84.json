        "text": "Great to hear from Joel Foster last night at the latest Auckland MUG. He talked about why the Document model is such a good fit for registry systems - and some of the great projects Foster Moore - The registry people Â® are involved in around the world. It was also great to take a few dive into upserts with Robin Stark from Devoli! And great to get the community together as per usual - thanks Erich Kuba for all of the work you do for the MongoDB community here in Auckland!\n\nðŸšœ It's two for Tuesday - This time, a Senior Product Manager. ðŸšœ This role will play an integral part in continuing to drive our product-first culture, take a leadership role within our Product team and report directly to our CPO. ðŸ’ª Ross Stanley Zainab Al-anbuky Richard Merryweather\n\nðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ At Figured, we arm our customers, partners, and farming community with actionable and unrivalled insight into their business. We do that through the visualisation and surfacing of billions of data points - putting love and care into making the underlying story of the data clear to our users. If that sentence got you feeling all warm and fuzzy ðŸ¤— , this is probably the role you're looking for! Join us as we kick off a massive project to create AI-driven data for our customers. ðŸ‘©ðŸŒ¾ Amy Milbourn Ross Stanley Zainab Al-anbuky\n\nWhat a brilliant day at MongoDB.local in Auckland today, and what an incredible privilege to share my story about the events that led me to search for a better database and to MongoDB. Massive shout out to MongoDB, Jake McInteer, Philipp Waffler, Cloudize, Jono Hoskin, Richard Merryweather, Adam Holt, Lance Wolters"
