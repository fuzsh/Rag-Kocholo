        "text": "Important principles may and must be flexible.\n\n—Abraham Lincoln\n\nApril 11, 1865\n\nIt is in the uncompromisingness with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or want of dogma that the danger lies.\n\n—Samuel Butler\n\nThe Way of All Flesh\n\nChapter LXVIII\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE REUNIFICATION QUESTION IN WEST GERMAN POLITICS\n\nThe Deutschlandpolitik (policy of unification of Germany) of the Federal Republic—both the official policy and that of the major political parties—is anchored on constitutional-legal concepts whose principal source is the Basic Law, the Federal Republic’s constitutional document. Thus, foreign policy is being steered by German constitutional-legal doctrines rather than by pragmatic ideas or considerations of expediency. But the West German state was not the first one known in history in which legal-constitutional theory served as guideline or yardstick for political behavior and action. Such theories were mostly the product of some unusual political-constitutional situation; they were used initially to explain some peculiar situation in constitutional-legal terms, and subsequently they became the basis of future policy. Such doctrines may shape political institutions and constitutional and international enactments, and they may direct public policy. The Constitution of the United States and its interpretation formed the theoretical basis of Union politics before, during, and after the Civil War and tended to enhance legalism in politics.\n\nThe West German political leaders and the majority of the country’s political elite, though realizing that the goal of reunification was to be achieved by means and methods of a foreign policy, could not help conceiving the question of German unity in terms of internal German politics. The ambivalence, inconsistencies, and misunderstandings created by this double approach were obvious; nonetheless, the doctrine, supported by motivations of righteousness and national sentiment and by the legal education of the policy-makers, continued to serve as the permanent basis of the reunification policy despite some of the practical difficulties and inconveniences of its implementation.\n\nWest Germany’s desire to consider the “temporary” division of Germany as an internal German affair was given clear expression in its constitutional document. Under this organic statute, the Federal Republic was to be only a temporary substitute for a future all-German state. It was thought that the compromise formula of creating only a “provisional” state would not foreclose the chances of reunification. A comparison with Weimar Germany is not without irony: the Weimar Constitution of 1919, intended to be a definitive one, was considered by many Germans a pis aller (a temporary expedient). The constitutional document of the Federal Republic, planned by its authors to be provisional, has outlived the lifetime of the Constitution of Weimar. The Basic Law, which reflected the Federal Republic’s foremost policy objective—reunification of Germany—proved to be a provisoire qui dure.1\n\nThe Basic Law and German Unity\n\nThe Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany is, by its own terms, a provisional constitutional document intended for a “transitional period” only. Though some national constitutions intended to be permanent have been replaced within a relatively short time, the provisional constitution of the Federal Republic has actually outlasted the thirteen-year lifespan of the definitive Weimar Constitution. By declaring itself temporary in character, the Basic Law constitutionally enacted the fundamental political goal and raison d’être of the Federal Republic: to preserve the “national and political unity” of the German people. Thus, with not negligible political effects on the German mind, the West German state considers itself a truncated unit of the nation and its government the only true representative of the German nation-state, no matter what future name the state will take.2\n\nState names may acquire particular significance. It should be remembered that the West German state does not call itself German Federal Republic but rather Federal Republic of Germany (the East German state’s name is German Democratic Republic). In German, the difference is even more expressive: West Germany is Bundesrepublik Deutschland instead of Deutsche Bundesrepublik.3\n\nAccording to its peamble, the Basic Law was enacted by the German people in the Länder of the Western zones and “also … on behalf of those Germans to whom participation was denied.” The preamble also called upon the entire German people “to achieve, by free self-determination, the unity and freedom of Germany.” German politicians and publicists, therefore, do not fail to point out that the furtherance of Germany’s reunification is, under the terms of the Basic Law, not only a political objective but also a duty prescribed by the provisions of this Law.4\n\nThe area of application of the Basic Law is not identical with the areas of the Länder which, according to the preamble, participated in its enactment. Article 23 mentions, in addition to the states of the Western zones, Greater Berlin as one of the territories in which the Law applies.5 In other parts of Germany, “it shall be put into force on their accession.”6 The Basic Law may, thus, be extended to those parts of “Germany” where, because of the existing international situation, it cannot be made applicable; and it may become the constitution of reunited Germany. But the Basic Law also provided for its own replacement by a permanent constitution when it pronounced in Article 146 that it shall cease to be in force “on the day on which a Constitution adopted by a free decision of the German people comes into force.”\n\nUnder the Basic Law there is only one kind of citizenship: German citizenship. There is no special citizenship reserved for the inhabitants of the Federal Republic.7 “Germany,” in the meaning of the Basic Law, is the area which was the German Reich on December 31, 1937, before Hitler embarked on his road of conquests. Citizens of the Reich, as it was at that date, their descendants, and also refugees or expellees of German stock are “Germans” within the meaning of the Basic Law. It follows that no citizenship of the German Democratic Republic would be recognized by any agency of West Germany.\n\nGerman political and legal scholars have pointed out that the Basic Law as well as the official political philosophy held by the Federal government rest on three fundamental theses: (1) the continued legal existence of the German nation-state; (2) the territorial integrity of this Germany, as long as a treaty of peace, to be concluded with an all-German government, has not changed the territorial status quo; and (3) within the confines of this German state there exists only one legitimate state-structure and government: the Federal Republic of Germany and its government.8\n\nThe Federal Republic’s basic policy goals are said to be inspired by these theses. There exists a general consensus among all major parties and policy decision-makers concerning these principles; however, they fail to explain fully the constitutional-legal and international-legal status of those political entities which exercise governmental functions in the area of Germany. The circumstances surrounding divided Germany have engendered constitutional and legal theories concerning the survival of the German state and the legal position of the two German governments, as well as the controversial situation of Berlin.\n\nThe constitutional-legal theories generally undertake to explicate three specific controversial points in terms of known constitutional or international legal tenets: continuity or discontinuity of the former German Reich; legal relationship of the Federal Republic with the former German state; and the question of legitimacy of one, or more than one, German political entity. It is, of course, understood that the above-mentioned areas of controversy often overlap or are logically dependent on one another.9\n\nThe complete surrender of Germany, Allied assumption of integral control over the country, and the subsequent revival of a native governmental machinery gave rise to various doctrinal interpretations. Outside Germany some held that with Germany’s unconditional surrender the German state had ceased to exist; these views were shared by Germans, too. As to the postsurrender status of the German area, opinion varied from asserting the existence of an inter-Allied condominium10 to the denial of any state power over Germany.11 Others, mostly West German scholars, developed the doctrine of German state survival: the German state as a legal entity had never ceased to exist; it had only lost its self-governing capacity to the inter-Allied government.12 This view received official confirmation by the wording of the Four-Power Declaration of Berlin (June 5, 1945) and by that of the Potsdam Protocol.13\n\nThe theories of the continuity of discontinuity of the German state are now of less political significance, but they are associated with doctrines relating to the present-day status of the Germanys. Since the re-establishment of sovereignty in the Federal Republic and in East Germany, a maze of conflicting or complementary state theories has grown up. We are here primarily concerned with views held in West Germany; those propounded in the German Democratic Republic as well as those relating to the status of Berlin will be considered in their respective chapters.\n\nThe state theories stressing the continuity and singularity of the German state either explain the Federal Republic as a Germany reduced in size (contraction doctrine) or as conterminous with the German state of 1937 but prevented, de facto, from extending the authority of its constitutional order beyond its factual borders (kernal- or core-state doctrine).14 The area of Germany beyond the constitutional authority of the Federal Republic is either considered as under foreign occupation or as international no-man’s land.15 Under these doctrines the Federal Republic is either identical with the former Reich or sole successor to the Reich.16\n\nSome constitutional scholars in Germany argue that the Federal Republic of Germany is legally co-extensive with historic Germany (within its boundaries of December 31, 1937) even if the area of validity (implementation) of the Basic Law is restricted to the area presently known as the Federal Republic.17 If this is correct, it would signify that the name Federal Republic of Germany might become, after the expected unification, the name of reunited Germany, unless replaced by some other appellation such as the Reich.\n\nThere exists a two-state doctrine whose practical conclusions are not basically dissimilar to those of the single-state doctrines. This “unreal” two-state theory differentiates between the dormant all-German state (which used to be called the German Reich) and the rump state which functions within part of its territory. The all-German state has so far failed to recover its capacity to function, while the Federal Republic possesses almost all the prerequisites of a sovereign state and is, because of its democratic legitimacy, entitled to represent, as a kind of trustee, the still inactive all-German state. The Federal government is, thus, one German government but not the German government, and at present there is no other German government. The “so-called” German Democratic Republic—also according to this view—fails to possess the characteristics of statehood because of its complete lack of popular democratic legitimacy. This doctrinal explanation appears to be the official view of the Social Democratic party on the constitutional-political status of Germany and of the Federal Republic.18\n\nAnother genuine two-state doctrine based on the continuity of Germany considers the German Democratic Republic as the secessionist part of Germany. Completed Germany is identified with the state presently known as the Federal Republic of Germany. A so-called roof-theory recognizes the existence of a nonreactivated Germany together with the partially limited and, therefore, not fully sovereign West and East Germanys: the first is considered to exercise its authority legitimately, while the second is only a de facto entity upheld by a foreign power. Finally, according to the theories which reject the continuity of Germany, the Federal Republic is regarded as a new state, successor to the Reich but not identical to it; only the German nation has remained, not the former German state. The German area east of the border of the Federal Republic is, by this view, considered “unredeemed” (irredenta) national territory under foreign domination.19\n\nThe Basic Law, by its reference to “Germany” (the reference to the Reich appears whenever the pre-1945 situation is meant), by its insistence on one German citizenship, and by its claim to valid extension over the whole of “Germany” is said to be in conformity with the core-state doctrine20 or an interpretation of the roof-state doctrine which would recognize limited statehood for the Federal Republic but deny it to the German Democratic Republic.21\n\nIt should be emphasized that all these subtle doctrines, however divergent in their theoretical explanation of Germany’s present status, are convergent with regard to their concluding principles which determine West German policies: namely, the continued existence of the pre-1945 German state within its 1937 boundaries and the sole legitimacy, within these boundaries, of the Federal Republic. The constitutional interpretation of the Federal Republic, as a continuing form of the Bismarckian German state created between 1867 and 1871, makes the demand for reunification more than a policy objective: it is the justification of the very existence of today’s free German state.\n\nThe Western powers and all the signatories of the revised Brussels Treaty have endorsed the thesis that the government of the Federal Republic is the only legitimate government in Germany. The relevant declarations always speak of the Federal Republic as the government “in” and not “of” Germany. This subtle differentiation may indicate that there might be one day another legitimate government in Germany. Or it may also indicate the support for the thesis that there is a theoretical, now dormant, all-Germany; and the Federal Republic, within the area of its own jurisdiction, is the ersatz government as long as the present provisional situation lasts.\n\nThus, the doctrine and practice of the singularity of the German state, as embodied in the Federal Republic, diametrically oppose the theory of two German states (or three German states if we include Berlin), the official thesis of the East German regime and its supporter, the Soviet Union.\n\nConstitutional-legal theories spur the momentum of politics by mingling political expediency with juridical arguments, but they also may place hurdles before pragmatic political planning. In a country like West Germany, where not only the powerful bureaucracy, including the staff of their Foreign Office, but also a great many politicians and publicists received legal training, constitutional theories supporting the idea of German unity—even if they are not always understandable to the ordinary laymen—are of considerable political and practical importance. Statements made by the Federal government, diplomatic notes of the German Foreign Office, arguments advanced by German legal scholars, writers, and journalists are today under the influence of the prevailing doctrines relative to Germany’s international and constitutional legal status.\n\nA political-legal doctrine that purports to explain the inner inspirations of a nation is both a source of strength and a source of weakness. It is a comfortable guideline for decision-making, a lodestar for public opinion, and a standard by which actions or attitudes can be measured. Doctrines often simplify decision-making, but they may hinder the solution of problems which could be solved if greater flexibility were employed. Such doctrines incline policy-shapers toward inflexibility where suppleness would be expedient.\n\nIt can never be ignored that the theoretical foundations used for explaining the status of the Federal Republic of Germany, of Berlin, and of the problems of Germany’s unity are inseparable from the understanding and appreciation of West German attitudes and foreign policy toward the fundamental issue of reunification.\n\nThe Federal Government and the Reunification Issue\n\nUnder Chancellor Adenauer’s administration, West German policy of Germany’s unification was far more programmatic and legalistic than pragmatic or political. Although the government in Bonn never ceased to pay lip-service to the goal of German unity, it appeared to be giving preference to European integration and participation in the Atlantic Alliance over the fundamental German problem. In the Weimar period the German government endeavored to maintain a politically productive balance between Ostpolitik and Weltpolitik (the name given to policies toward the great powers of the West); however, under Adenauer there was, practically, no Ostpolitik. That Deutschlandpolitik was essentially Ostpolitik was belatedly realized.\n\nUntil the last years of Adenauer’s chancellorship, foreign policy remained the exclusive domain of the aged head of the Federal government. He, personally, was responsible for the foreign policy choices, although each time he obtained an endorsement of his policy by the West German voters. When his Deutschlandpolitik proved barren, he was blamed for its failure. The opposition always objected to the priority of his choice. The question of whether the Soviet Union had, in 1952, and again in 1954, meant business is moot. More moderate critics admit that the Chancellor may have been right in assuming that the Soviets used delaying and obstructing tactics without serious intentions of agreeing on reunification but for obtaining such evidence he should have promoted negotiations.22 By others he was blamed for his failure to admit that Western political and military integration was incompatible with a realistic policy for German unity.23 But his adherents were ready to absolve him by arguing that his policy was essentially correct, only the West “was not strong enough.”24 And many in West Germany, though they may be reticent to express views on this subject, believe that Adenauer’s line was correct “anyhow.”\n\nIt is fair to assume that at the time the choices were made (and many in the CDU/CSU thought that there were no “real choices”) Adenauer genuinely believed that his policy of detour; namely, that pressure by the West would force Soviet hands and would “spontaneously” produce German unity. While the prolonged negotiations on the Federal Republic’s rearmament and admission into NATO were pursued, Adenauer considered talks with the Soviet highly undesirable.25 Later, after West Germany’s integration into the West was achieved, he expected fruitful negotiations with the Soviet Union; but for this he waited in vain. Moscow simply refused to recognize that “it was beaten in Germany.”\n\nThe conclusion that in Adenauer’s scale of values entry into the Western political and military system and Franco-German reconciliation preceded the goal of reunification appears correct.26 Adenauer’s concept rested also on an exaggerated estimate of Western strength and on an underestimation of Soviet abilities and power. On the other hand, his opponents will never be able to prove (unless Soviet archives, if opened, would produce such evidence) that reunification would otherwise have been possible.27\n\nThe successful founder of the Federal Republic had played his card on the reunification issue and lost. His personal charisma (source of much of his success) also faded after 1958, both domestically and internationally. His Christian-oriented quondam partners, John Foster Dulles, Robert Schuman of France, Alcide de Gasperi of Italy, and others, were no longer there to support him. His pliable and Western-oriented Foreign Minister, Heinrich von Brentano, was replaced by the more self-willed and more nationalistic Gerhard Schröder. As one commentator pointed out, the leading personnel of the Federal Republic, Adenauer, Brentano, and Franz Josef Strauss—all Catholics and devotees of European integration—had, by 1963, been replaced by Ludwig Erhard, the new Federal Chancellor; Schröder, the Foreign Minister; and Kai-Uwe von Hassel, the Federal Minister of Defense—all Protestants.28 This momentous change of the guard coincided by-and-large with the realization that the road to European political integration and to an Atlantic partnership was blocked. These developments, together with the deadlock of the reunification policy, did not fail to impress them.29\n\nThere can be no doubt that the reunification question was to be the primum mobile of West German foreign politics under Erhard and his successors, a reunification policy more realistically viewed and pursued than earlier. Though rhetoric could be dispensed with, emphasis was to rest on a pragmatic rather than a merely declarative policy. This did not mean that the government would devote less attention to its relations with the West; the “policy of movement” was still to be conducted under the aegis of “Four-Power responsibility for German unity.” Erhard announced that “even if our German policy is only part of our foreign policy, it is nevertheless its deciding element.” While the Deutschlandpolitik was to be reactivated and its methods changed, the basic principles were to remain unchanged: “the claim to represent all-Germany must remain inviolable.”30\n\nIt is certain that the second chancellor of the Federal Republic did not share those inhibitions with regard to German unification which the first was often suspected of harboring. While Adenauer’s outlook may rightly have been considered anti-Prussian and “Rhenish-provincial” and also much influenced by his Carolingian-Catholic Weltanschauung, Erhard’s Bavarian-Franconian birth, his contacts during his career in various parts of Germany and his general world-outlook prevented him from being a regionally oriented German. The election results of 1965 were generally considered his personal and not his party’s success. The CDU/CSU managed to increase the percentage of its votes from 45.3 per cent in 1961 to 47.6 per cent. The opposition SPD gained 39.3 per cent (as against 36.2 per cent in 1961); the losers were the FDP (a decrease from 12.8 per cent to 9.5 per cent) and splinter parties which received less than the statutory number of votes for obtaining seats in the Bundestag. It seems fairly evident that the reunification issue had no impact whatsoever on the outcome of these elections.\n\nGerhard Schröder, the initiator of the “policy of movement,” is another specimen of a deregionalized German. His father, originally from the Protestant North, was an employee of the Reich railways who happened to be stationed in Saarbrücken when his son was born. The Foreign Minister spent his youth in Southwest Germany, studied law in Köngisberg, East Prussia, in Berlin, and in Bonn. After World War II, he settled in Düsseldorf, in North Rhine-Westphalia. As Minister of the Interior for eight years, he proved to be a versatile tactician. His assumption of the post of foreign minister after the 1961 elections heralded a greater flexibility in handling a problem which heretofore had been dominated by the doctrinal cliches adopted in the Foreign Office under Walter Hallstein, State Secretary, and Wilhelm G. Grewe, head of the Political Section in the mid-fifties, with the approval of the Chancellor and the then-Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano. Schröder’s greater “pragmatism” soon brought him into conflict with Adenauer and the punctilious legalists of the CDU/CSU. Under the post-Adenauer administration, Schröder, no doubt, has enjoyed greater freedom of action. Nevertheless, he has remained exposed to the often extremely sharp criticism of the members of his own Party and dependent on the influences of his own Foreign Office bureaucracy.\n\nThe domestic and diplomatic staff of the German Foreign Office is in a position to exercise independent authority in matters of policy detail and to have considerable influence on questions of principle in the decision-making process.31 Foreign Office officials who handle current business in matters of the “Soviet Zone of Occupation,” of Berlin, and Soviet and East European questions are engaged in a relentless, exacting struggle against encroachments or attempted encroachments on West German and Allied rights and positions. They generally have a realistic and down-to-earth view on these questions. They are aware how dangerous it is to give way on seemingly minute changes introduced by the adversary and how important it is to prevent precedents from being created over what appear to be harmless procedures. They are conscious of the fact that past weaknesses or oversights have later been formidably exploited. When in 1955 nonmilitary traffic to West Berlin was handed over by the Russians to the officials of the German Democratic Republic, there was only a lame protest by the Western powers. The incorporation of East Berlin into the German Democratic Republic hardly elicited formal protests by the West. By similar “salami tactics” is the East German regime intent to have itself recognized as the other German state.\n\nThe Foreign Office feels that it is its task to forestall any further erosion of Western positions or rights vis-à-vis the German Democratic Republic, both regarding the international status of the latter and the situation of Berlin. Its watchfulness is alerted to prevent any “upgrading” of the East German regime which would eventually lead to the recognition of Ulbricht’s government. It knows that this struggle can be fought only in full agreement with the Western Allies, especially the United States, and that the Federal government is far from having freedom of action in the matter.\n\nForeign Office personnel often deplore having to ward off Communist encroachments passively with little opportunity to initiate offensive diplomatic actions against vulnerable positions of the adversary. At present, they consider the Soviet offensive against West Berlin to have failed. It is, however, admitted that the Wall has, for the time being, saved the East German regime from collapse; in this respect, the division of East and West Berlin has proved to be a political success. The practical advantages of the Wall are, it is asserted, largely counterbalanced by the propagandistic disadvantage it has evoked.\n\nThe German Foreign Office considers the Hallstein Doctrine (that no diplomatic relations can be maintained with states which have officially recognized the German Democratic Republic)32 not only useful but absolutely indispensable for the purposes of West German policies. In the view of their leading officials, this doctrine has proved more resistant to erosions and exceptions than originally imagined. They are, however, conscious of the drawbacks in the application of this policy. Rigid advocates of the Doctrine point to the utter sterility of the diplomatic contacts with the Soviet Union (which was exempted from the application of the Hallstein Doctrine) and envisage no greater hopes from contacts with either Warsaw or Prague. Other officials who, sympathetic to the United States’ view, favor greater flexibility, consider full diplomatic contacts with East European Communist powers (except of course, East Germany) as likely to produce fruitful results. But even these “progressives” view the setting up of diplomatic relations with these countries as maximum concessions within the frame of the Hallstein Doctrine.\n\nThe flexibility which the German Foreign Office and its minister, with the approval or tolerance of Chancellor Erhard, have been practicing in handling the East-West issues, including those of reunification and Berlin, was constantly subjected to the scrutiny and criticism of the three major political parties.33 Any major deviation from the official legal position would create more than ministerial crisis; it would be considered a real crise d’état. Not only would the foreign minister’s position be at stake, but also the belief would be held that Germany’s future was being jeopardized.\n\nWhile Adenauer with his foreign ministers was able to carry on his foreign policy with minimum interference by the coalition parties and with an undisguised disdain for criticism, Erhard and Schröder were not unmindful of the need to implement a foreign policy in agreement and accommodation with the opposition party. Consensus of all three major parties for the pursuit of vital national goals was certainly their wish. Such a course was made possible by the adoption of the government’s position on reunification by the Social Democratic party. The quasi-unanimity of all three parties on this crucial issue has, however, allowed the creation of internal rifts in all major parties that make foreign policy somewhat less than bipartisan.\n\nThe CDU/CSU and Reunification\n\nThe leaders and parliamentarians of the Christian Democratic Union and of its Bavarian branch, the Christian Social Union, acted under Adenauer’s leadership as guardians of the correct interpretation and application of the prevailing doctrine and policy concerning the quest for German unity. But even for the most faithful adherents of the “one state” doctrine, this concept, in its variations and subtleties, may have presented pitfalls. In fact, even the speakers of the CDU/CSU lacked the semantic adroitness to conform to the requirements of the official state doctrine. Thus, if (perhaps ironically) the “East Zonal Republic” is mentioned instead of the correct “Central German Soviet Zone,” the speaker may expose himself to criticism. Even such a seemingly correct expression that the Federal Republic “represents All-Germany” may be taken as an endorsement of the “roof doctrine,” assuming the existence of two entities: one which represents and the other which is represented; correctly stated, the Federal Republic is the “provisionally contracted form of All-Germany.” Similarly, it is not without ambiguity to doubt the “legitimacy of the Soviet Zonal government” because thereby the speaker might have implicitly admitted the existence of a state which only fails to have, for lack of popular representation, a legitimate government.34 These slight deviations, however, have mostly been overshadowed by more serious aberrations of the opposition parties that at times gave rise to violent and acrimonious debates.\n\nThe phenomenal success of Adenauer, except in the matter of reunification, silenced critics within the ruling party. This does not mean that there was no opposition to the priority which Adenauer, without openly admitting it, assigned to Western integration above German unity. Jakob Kaiser, Ernst Lemmer, and others—most of them either refugees from the East or in close contact with Berlin—stood nearer to the ideas which were voiced by Schumacher and other Socialist leaders. But the personality of the old Chancellor and his insistence that alliance with the West, security, freedom, and strength for the Federal Republic could in time force the hand of the Russians and compel them to give up their East German bastion, eventually silenced them. The Chancellor also seemed peculiarly favored by fortune; the most controversial item of the Paris Agreements of 1954, the international status of the Saar, was luckily replaced by retrocession to Germany. This outstanding event, together with the negative effect of the Hungarian tragedy of 1956, demonstrated that friendship with the West pays and that only a policy of strength could impress the Soviet Union.\n\nBut by 1958 open doubts arose, even within the ranks of the CDU/CSU, with regard to official policy on reunification. The second struggle for Berlin, the pat positions of the Geneva Conference of 1959, and the erosions of the one-state doctrine confused many of Adenauer’s admirers. Only when in 1960 the erstwhile fervent critics of the Federal government’s German policy (the Social Democrats) went over to the official view on reunification was the self-confidence of the CDU/CSU somewhat restored. Nevertheless, there was no return to “blind faith” in Adenauer’s concept of “spontaneous” reunification. The necessity for giving up some of the earlier dogmatic rigidity developed various approaches which, at present, divide leaders and factions on the issue of reunification. The revolts against Adenauer, the travails of his succession, and, finally, the transfer of power to the tolerant Erhard increased divisive tendencies within the Union parties.\n\nDivergent trends within the CDU/CSU are not restricted to the policy issues of reunification. Different views exist on the intensity of alignment with the United States or France, on matters of European integration, and on alternatives of defense strategy and nuclear preparedness. On the reunification issue proper, it is possible to distinguish between adherents of the old rigid, strictly legalistic attitudes and advocates of more flexible, mobile, or pragmatic views. Adherents of both opinions may envisage a longterm view (the “patient” ones) or urge immediate measures and pressures, both against the Western Allies for greater support and against the Eastern foe for concessions. All these trends and their representative groups intersect one another within the party, resulting in an even greater variety of views and shifting attitudes whenever a concrete problem emerges or a decision is to be taken on any particular point.\n\n1) The hard-liners advocated a rigid maintenance of the Adenauer policy; that is, nonrecognition of the East German regime in all its aspects, no contacts whatsoever with East German leaders, insistence on four-power responsibility for German unity and Berlin, and no acknowledgment of the incorporation of eastern territories into Poland and the Soviet Union. They held the view that any loosening of the doctrinal-legal position must lead to an all-out erosion and collapse of their policy and, sooner or later, to a recognition of Germany’s partition. They insisted that Soviet intransigence must be opposed by even greater intransigence in the West. Adenauer himself, since he has given up the reins of government, has returned to his original inflexibility and considered any United States policy of relaxation (even the wheat sales to Russia) a dangerous and ominous experiment doomed to failure or a confirmation of the division of Germany.35 In March, 1966, at the Congress which elected Erhard chairman of the Party, the ex-Chancellor stated that “the Soviet Union wants peace” and later added that the Soviets wanted peace because they needed peace.36\n\nIn this hard stand Adenauer was supported by a considerable number of Party leaders and Bundestag deputies. Former Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano, leader of the parliamentary group of the CDU/CSU who died in 1965, and Heinrich Krone, Minister without portfolio, were known to oppose any easing of tension without meaningful concessions by the Soviet Union; otherwise, they claimed it would be Germany that would have to pay the price.37 This inflexible attitude is shared by many members of the Catholic group of the CDU leadership and, in particular, by the CSU branch led by former Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss and the influential deputy, Karl-Theodor Freiherr zu Guttenberg.38 Other geographical factors are significant: the Chairman of the CDU’s Berlin organization, Franz Amrehn, has sternly opposed any “impatient abandonment” of positions—even the concept that an economic improvement or other humanization of conditions in the Democratic Republic would lead to a relaxation of tensions. He criticized the Socialist press chief of Berlin, Egon Bahr, for having suggested the omission of quotation marks around the words “German Democratic Republic,” so as to suggest the real existence of such a state.39\n\n2) The flexible-liners wished to emerge from frozen and merely negative attitudes. They were far from advocating the recognition of the East German state or from giving way on Berlin or on the Eastern Territories. But they favored contacts, negotiations, and a flexible diplomacy without abandoning the essence of earlier positions. Thus, they had no scruples against signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty even when the German Democratic Republic also became co-signatory. They had also favored the establishment of trade missions in countries which maintain diplomatic relations with East Germany.\n\nThe Foreign Minister, Gerhard Schröder, who succeeded Heinrich von Brentano in the post-1961 Adenauer cabinet, dared to adopt a “policy of movement” or a “change through rapprochement.” This mobile and pragmatic view on reunification was then supported by only a few influential members of the CDU/CSU. Erhard, however, has rallied to Schröder’s views and so, apparently, has Eugen Gerstenmaier, the President of the Bundestag. Gerstenmaier himself has always shown a certain disposition toward flexible views; he once favored the linking of disengagement with the question of reunification and was ready to reverse the priorities on “free elections” versus “peace treaty.”40\n\nThe flexible-liners favored co-operation with the United States and have seemed undisturbed by direct Soviet-American exchanges on Berlin and negotiations aiming at the easing of international tensions. Though Schröder and his supporters asserted that the Federal Republic cannot afford a harder policy line than that of the United States, they have come under the heavy fire of their opponents in the Party whenever they have tried to implement their “pragmatic” and “realistic” ideas.41 Schröder’s future depended on the support which he could obtain from the Chancellor and that segment of the Party which was ready to follow similar policies; on the vehemence of the attacks of his opponents, themselves divided; and, last but not least, on international developments and the possibilities for conformity with the official policy of Washington without appearing to infringe on vital German interests.\n\nAfter the 1965 elections when Erhard was called to reorganize his cabinet, the post of the foreign minister, together with the policy to be followed, became the bones of contention between the warring factions of the CDU/CSU. Erhard had to protect Schröder against the onslaughts of the “hard” group led by Adenauer himself. The struggle developed into a three-cornered fight when the leaders of the FDP, the coalition partner, joined the battle. Although the FDP leader, Erich Mende, himself a candidate for the office of a foreign minister, did not see eye-to-eye with Schröder, he was even more opposed to Franz Josef Strauss, who would have been the favored son of the hard-liners for that ministerial post.42\n\nThe new cabinet continued to include Schröder as Foreign Minister; the struggle thus ended with a score in favor of the “policy of movement” and “gradualism” to create a “change through rapprochement.” Mende, in addition to his post as Vice-Chancellor, obtained the Ministry of All-German Affairs. Johann Baptist Gradl, the CDU deputy for Berlin, received another key post concerning reunification: he became the Minister for Refugee and Expellee Affairs. He had rallied to Schröder’s views and shortly after his appointment even dared to express the view that West Germany would have to make concrete “sacrifices” if there was to be any hope for reunification of Germany. He particularly hinted that some changes in the 1937 frontier in favor of Poland could be recognized by a future all-German government.43\n\n3) The impatient ones are to be found both among the flexible and inflexible leaders of the CDU/CSU. The flexible-impatients wish to speed up certain “dynamic” moves for the opening of meaningful negotiations on the reunification question. They are particularly anxious to alleviate the sufferings of the inhabitants of Berlin and of East Germany. But many more impatients are to be found among the ranks of the advocates of tougher policies. Their impatience presses them to demand sterner measures of retaliation and use of pressures against the Pankow government and its Soviet protector. Their discontent is often expressed against the Western Allies who, in their view, fail to show sufficient vigor and determination for German unity. They reproach the West for having missed good opportunities and predict that, failing the achievement of German unity within reasonable time, Germans “could lose their patience” and in their frustration would either turn toward Russia or turn their backs on “democracy.” The erection of the Berlin Wall is advanced, partly as evidence of Western passivity, partly as a reason for urgent action and for a change.44 Accordingly, impatience may work both ways: it is an inducement to rapproachement or to increased tension.\n\nIn the view of the impatient ones, consistent patience is, in fact, a policy of doing nothing. Schröder opposed such an attitude when he said: “I am of the opinion that a solution to the German Question cannot be attained in long-term, allegedly natural developments in Europe. This problem can be solved only if political tensions are removed and a formal agreement is reached.”45 The adherents of “automatic” or “spontaneous” reunification (the old Adenauer school) were opposed to the tactical moves suggested by the impatients which would reveal that the Germans had lost their nerve.\n\n4) The patient ones are prepared and have tried to prepare the German public for a long waiting period before German unity can be achieved. Patients are to be found both among the advocates of hard policies and among the flexible ones. The latter foresee a long process which will lead to a gradual relaxation in the Cold War and create an atmosphere that will render a favorable solution to the German question possible. Many adherents of flexible politics favor a Polish-German rapprochement which, in their opinion, will be conducive to the implementation of German unity; but they have to admit that the road toward a genuine understanding with the Poles will, inevitably, be a long one.\n\nPatient-inflexibles are perhaps more numerous. They generally are those who remained faithful to the concept of an automatic or spontaneous reunification of Germany. In their view, the Russians will one day feel obliged to change their attitude toward the German nation and give up voluntarily their hold over East Germany. They are convinced that, in the course of time, the question of German unification is bound to become “negotiable,” and then the price, if any, to be paid for it will not be excessive. The intensification of the Sino-Soviet conflict is invoked by them as one of the possible reasons which, in the long run, will force the Soviets to give up their advanced positions in Central Europe.\n\n5) The so-called Gaullists (they would disclaim such an appellation) have been impressed by the French President’s active and energetic foreign policy which made nationalism fashionable again in Europe. They are not necessarily pro-French; they are German Gaullists. Translated into the realm of pro-unification policy, German “Gaullism” denies or minimizes the significance of ideological conflicts but stresses the existence of national power struggles and, by definition, wishes to apply a combination of toughness and flexibility. In the opinion of the Gaullists, the German problem is closely allied with the companion problems of the East Central European satellite countries. Unification of Germany is likely to be achieved simultaneously with what they call “the unification of Europe”—that is, when all the area between Germany and Russia will be given up by the Soviets.46 The Gaullists are often suspicious of American designs and consider American policy “soft,” especially when toughness seems more profitable. Together with De Gaulle, they doubt the likelihood of an all-out American engagement in case of a Soviet attack against West Germany or Berlin.\n\n6) The “Atlanticists” in the CDU/CSU support European integration and Atlantic partnership. They are definitely pro-American but not necessarily anti-French, though they distrust Gaullism. They are ready to favor a genuine European political federation. In their view, Adenauer’s original concept was correct: it was indispensable, for the sake of German unity, first to establish security and prosperity in the Federal Republic and close alliance and co-operation with the Western powers, especially with the United States. It was, furthermore, this line of policy that enabled the Federal Republic to gain the Western powers’ full endorsement for the German cause and protection against the East for the Federal Republic and Berlin. In their opinion, a neutral or uncommitted Germany would have become a no-man’s-land exposed to a Communist take-over. They believe that a fully integrated Europe in close alliance with the United States will persuade Poles, Czechs, and even the Russians that they have nothing to fear from German nationalism should Germany regain her unity. But they are doubtful that the German problem could ever be solved without an all-out East-West settlement contributing to a solution of the status of the East Central European countries now under Soviet control.47\n\nThe Atlanticists agree that theirs is a long-term policy. Accordingly, they generally belong to the “patient” category of politicians. They may be adherents of a hard or of a flexible policy toward East Germany, but they try to adjust their views to the course set by Washington.\n\nThe divergences of approach to the reunification issue resulted in a paradox in German politics: the politician who favored an active, mobile attitude is often considered “soft” on German unity because flexibility and impatience might lead to concessions; on the other hand, the passive, patient politician preaching “immobolisme” is considered “hard.” Thus, Adenauer is still thought of by many as the “strong” leader, and Erhard was suspected of being “soft.”48\n\nThe Social Democratic Party and Reunification\n\nIn the years following the Geneva Conferences of 1956, the SPD never ceased to draw attention to failures and omissions of Chancellor Adenauer and his Party that were said to have prevented the achievement of German unity. The Chairman of the Party, Erich Ollenhauer, at the Party Congress in July, 1956, derided the government for its stolidity in failing to pursue an “active policy for re-unification of Germany by the Germans themselves.” He suggested full use of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union for the sake of unification, the “normalization” of relations with Poland and Czechoslovakia (implying the abandonment of the Hallstein Doctrine), and establishment of a “maximum of relations” with the population of the “Soviet Zone” through agreements with the “competent agencies of the Soviet Occupied Zone of Germany.”49 The ambivalent position of the SPD was characterized by such contradictory theses as dropping, on the one hand, the claim to “one German state” and, on the other hand, refusing to recognize East Germany as a state. In the same speech Ollenhauer stated that the question of German unity could not be solved by direct negotiations between “Bonn and Pankow,” but through four-power agreements. He did not, however, exclude the possibility of talks between the West and East German governments “should they become later indispensable and if they can be carried out in internationally unobjectionable forms.”50\n\nSuch statements must have sounded extremely suspect to adherents of the official reunification concepts. It should be remembered that, while many exponents of political views in West Germany were critical of the Adenauer line on reunification, these critics very seldom objected to the doctrinal position held by the government. Even the state theory adopted by the SPD did not, in its ultimate conclusions, differ from the government concept. The SPD’s rather diffuse and ambiguous views on the methods of achieving reunification voiced prior to the 1957 elections did not advance its popularity with the voters.\n\nThe Berlin crisis of late 1958 and the subsequent Foreign Ministers’ Conference induced the SPD leadership to prepare, early in 1959, a comprehensive plan for the solution of the German question. The inconsistencies of earlier declarations were thus to be eliminated and proposals formulated which were not in direct opposition to solutions earlier advocated by the Soviet Union itself. On January 10, 1959, Soviet notes were handed to the three Western powers and to the Federal Republic proposing the convocation of a peace conference on Germany and enclosing a draft text of a peace treaty to be signed by Germany’s adversaries in World War II and the “two German governments.”51 The reunification plan of the SPD was designed to persuade the German public that its terms, if adopted, would forestall the danger of a peace settlement with two Germanys, instead of one, or a separate treaty with only the German Democratic Republic—measures which in either case would perpetuate the division of Germany.\n\nThe SPD reunification program, known as the Deutschlandplan (Germany Plan)52 was tailored to conform to some disengagement projects, such as those submitted by the British labor leader, Hugh Gaitskell; by George Kennan; by the former Belgian Foreign Minister, Van Zeeland; and by the Polish Foreign Minister, Rapacki.53 It, therefore, proposed as a first stage the establishment of a “zone of relaxation” in Central Europe, including both parts of Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. This “zone of relaxation” would gradually be evacuated by all foreign forces and denuclearized; the four great powers and other participants in these agreements were to enter into a collective security convention.\n\nThe reunification process, according to the Deutschlandplan, was to be accomplished in three consecutive steps. First, an all-German conference was to be set up with representatives of both German governments on a parity basis. The conference was to pave the way toward unification by introducing provisions, common to all parts of Germany, in the field of human rights and economics. The second step was to be the convocation of an all-German parliamentary council, consisting of equal numbers of members elected in West and East Germany. This parliamentary council was to prepare the complete realignment of the legal, financial, and social systems of the two Germanys and to decide, by a two-thirds majority, on the date and circumstances of general elections for a constituent national assembly which was to frame and adopt the all-German constitution. All of these all-German bodies were to sit in Berlin; during the three gradual steps the status of this city was to remain unchanged.\n\nThe SPD’s reunification plan clearly proposed the recognition, as an equal partner, of the German Democratic Republic. In allowing for equal representation of seventeen million Germans with the fifty-four million of the Federal Republic, it even conceded superior weight to a minority. But the weakest point of this scheme was the fact that the East German representatives could surely be expected to speak and vote according to the instructions of the Communist party, while the freely elected members from the Federal Republic would have represented different shades of opinion and one dissenting vote could have turned the balance in favor of the East. The two-thirds majority, required for the setting of general elections, could easily have been sabotaged by the Communist members, leading the whole procedure into an inevitable deadlock. In the meantime, however, the German Democratic Republic would have achieved its primary objective: its recognition as an independent German state. The Deutschlandplan argued that the opening of the border between East and West Germany—the free flow of people and goods from one part of the country to the other—as a result of the agreements would benefit unification and that the higher living standards and greater economic power of West Germany would compel the East to acquiesce in German unity; but these arguments were all based on speculations of a hazardous nature. After all, for many years after 1945 there had been free circulation between the two parts of Berlin; this had not led the East German Communists to change their economic and political system in their portion of the city. The Deutschlandplan evidently underestimated the techniques and potentialities of totalitarian regimentation. It offered the West Germans something they were anxious to avoid: an experiment which might jeopardize their hard-won security and political equilibrium.\n\nThe Deutschlandplan exposed the SPD to the criticism of the two other major parties, of intellectuals all over the country, and of many of their own Party members. The abandonment of the Plan, almost as soon as it was published, exposed its impracticality through hard experience.\n\nIn March, 1959, a German Social Democratic delegation, consisting of Carlo Schmid, Vice-President of the Bundestag, and Fritz Erler, Vice-Chairman of the Party, visited Moscow, met members of the Soviet Central Committee, high officials of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and Khrushchev himself. The German Socialist leaders became fully acquainted with the Soviet views regarding Germany. Khrushchev claimed to have no further interest in whether the Federal Republic severed its ties with the North Atlantic Alliance: in neither case would the balance of power be altered. They were told that the Soviet government was interested only in the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two German states. Such a treaty would render the occupation status of Berlin superfluous. As for the unification of Germany, it was a matter for the Germans to decide; the Federal government should discuss this question with the East German government. The Soviet government could offer only its good offices for facilitating the conclusion of an agreement to this effect.54\n\nThe conversations in Moscow persuaded the Social Democratic leaders that, under the prevailing circumstances, the Russians would not consider any form of disengagement or neutralization of Germany as adequate compensation for the potential loss of their East German satellite. As Erler expressed it, they were intent on consolidating the status quo and, for that reason, were pressing for a treaty of peace based on the status quo. With regard to Berlin, on the other hand, they wished to change the status quo because the present situation of West Berlin was disturbing.55\n\nIt now became evident that the Deutschlandplan was as poor a tool for furthering the reunification of Germany as it was unpopular in the country. The inconclusive ending of the Foreign Ministers’ Conference in Geneva during the summer of 1959 finally convinced Socialist leaders that their much-heralded Plan would, at the next general elections, be a burden on their Party rather than a launching pad to victory. It was easy to say that the bluff of the East German Communists should be called. But it was an accepted tenet of West German public opinion and a view largely held by Socialist voters, too, that the position of the Federal Republic should not be risked. The Deutschlandplan would clearly have opened West Germany to Communist infiltration, cajolery, and pressure. And to deal with the leaders of the SED, the persecutors of workers and students, was not to the taste of Social Democrats. They concluded that their estimate of Soviet intentions had been overoptimistic and, therefore, erroneous. The Deutschlandplan was dropped as quietly as possible, and a new reunification policy was turned over.\n\nThe SPD’s abandonment of neutralistic or “third force” policies was not altogether easy. The policy change was decided by an extraordinary Party meeting in Bad Godesberg (known as the “Godesberg Plan”) on November 15, 1959. The practical implementation of this volte face took place on March 18, 1960, when SPD Deputy Chairman, Herbert Wehner declared in the name of his Party that the Deutschlandplan had become “outdated by developments.” And on March 24, 1960, he submitted to the Bundestag a new, four-point program which contained proposals for relaxation in Central Europe “with the view of promoting the rapprochement of Germany’s two parts”; for demonstrations by the people of Germany to induce the four powers to open the road toward reunification; for the strengthening of economic, social, and cultural ties between the divided parts of Germany; and for a combination of moves which would lead toward German unity or would, at least, relieve Berlin from Soviet pressures and prevent any final international recognition of Germany’s partition.56\n\nDuring the Bundestag debates on international politics on June 30, 1960, the SPD undertook to align itself with the governmental views on foreign policy and, in particular, the reunification issue. Invited by Franz Josef Strauss, the Minister of Defense, to accept four basic policy theses of the Federal government, Herbert Wehner gave positive replies. He declared that the SPD was ready to accept the Western European and Atlantic alliance systems as the basis and frame for all efforts of the German foreign and reunification policies. Furthermore, Wehner declared, the SPD did not demand the withdrawal of the Federal Republic from the Western alliance and was ready to consider German participation in the alliance as a contribution toward the policy for reunification. The SPD, he said, endorsed the necessity of a powerful national defense and did not, in principle, favor any form of disengagement. On the other hand, it wished self-determination and free elections in East Germany.\n\nQuestioned by CDU Minister Krone as to whether the Deutschlandplan could, in all its details, be considered “past history,” Wehner replied, “Certainly.”57\n\nIt was now the turn of Herbert Wehner to ask the CDU/CSU whether it would not be preferable to recognize the moral and national integrity of the SPD opposition party in its desire to promote German unity. He pointed out that an irreconcilable enmity between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats would be too heavy a burden for a partitioned Germany.58\n\nThe SPD thus not only reversed itself on its attitude toward the ways and means of reunification but also suggested active collaboration on this national issue. It did not, however, acknowledge past errors or the propriety of Adenauer’s policy. On the contrary, its reproach was that the government had missed opportunities to negotiate with the Soviet Union when it might have proved profitable.59 The Socialists reached the conclusion that, for the time being, no more could be done for reunification than to rely on the possibilities inherent in the Western alliance and the diplomatic support of the West.\n\nThis change of fronts was no tactical move to attract voters but a policy change believed in and abided by. Simultaneously, their attitude toward the Federal Republic also changed. Earlier the Social Democrats had been inclined to regard the Bonn Republic as even more provisional than was warranted under the terms of the Basic Law. The West German state was frequently compared with the “Confederation of the Rhine,” that puppet construction of Napoleonic domination.60 Such attacks now came to an end and the SPD has, in every respect, become a loyal opposition, more loyal than in the past.\n\nSubsequent to Ollenhauer’s death, the SPD elected Willy Brandt Chairman of the Party. Brandt, the governing Mayor of West Berlin, could be considered a symbol of the resistance of Berlin and, at the same time, the embodiment of German desire for reunification. Willy Brandt was known as the initiator of the policy of “small steps,” another way to express a gradual approach to the East (including East Germany), thus paving the way for reunification. It would be difficult to point to any principal difference between Schröder’s flexible policy and that supported by Willy Brandt, though they did differ on concrete issues.\n\nWilly Brandt’s chairmanship helped little to secure for the SPD the much-hoped-for majority or even plurality at the 1965 elections. As stated earlier, these election results could hardly be considered an answer to the reunification question: this question simply lacked topical appeal. It is wrong to state, as did the author Günter Grass, who campaigned for the Social Democrats, that by refusing to give a majority to the Party of Willy Brandt, the German electorate “had voted against re-unification.”61\n\nBut if bipartisan policy, which developed since 1961, was a complicated matter because of the various trends prevailing within the CDU/CSU, it became even more entangled because of different shades of opinion within the SPD itself.\n\nBipartisan Reunification Policy\n\nBipartisanship in German unity policy was not reached by any formal agreement; it was achieved by the alignment of the Social Democratic party with the basic course followed by the Federal government and the CDU/CSU. This endorsement could never, however, be complete because, as we have seen, even the official doctrine on reunification allowed manifold interpretations and applications. Even while official SPD policy now adjusted itself to governmental views, no absolute unanimity existed within the Social Democratic party on many questions of detail. Differing nuances of opinion which, according to the significance attached to them in a given situation, could occasionally grow into formidable political conflicts, beset the SPD no less than the CDU/CSU. It has thus happened that specific views held by one faction in the Union parties may come close to or even be identical with views held by a group within the SPD. This is the manner in which bipartisanship prevails: for divergent opinions, too, acquire a bipartisan character when they are shared by members of both participating political parties.\n\nThe basic though tacit agreement which now appeared to exist between the major German parties included the following theses:\n\n1) The primary task of German politics is the restoration of German unity in “freedom and peace.” This policy objective is, thus, inseparable from another postulate: the preservation of peace (by which is also meant the security of the Federal Republic).62\n\n2) Any form of a two German states doctrine is to be rejected; the Federal Republic is the only true representative of the German nation.63 This principle, worded in the form of the one-state roof theory 64 as endorsed by the SPD, was expressed by Fritz Erler in the course of the debate on the declaration of policy by the new Erhard government in late October, 1963, in the following manner: “The German Federal Republic is the form of state organization in the free part of our native land, and it will one day be merged into a free united Germany. That in no way takes from its dignity.…”65\n\n3) The reunification of Germany is to be achieved by peaceful means only; preferably by an application of the right of self-determination (free elections).\n\n4) The improvement of the fate of Germans in East Germany is, for humanitarian reasons, to be considered an immediate and urgent objective.\n\n5) The Federal Republic remains committed to the defense and international representation of Berlin (the SPD is more inclined to stress the view according to which West Berlin is part of the Federal Republic).66\n\n6) According to international law, the boundaries of Germany are those as they existed on December 31, 1937; the Oder-Neisse Line can, therefore, not be recognized as a frontier until the border question is settled by a peace treaty.67\n\n7) The bipartisan policy for reunification also relies on four-power responsibility for the restoration of German unity and on three-power responsibility for the maintenance of the Berlin status quo. The solution of the German question should be sought in association with the question of European security. A secession of united Germany from the Western alliance, is, however, not foreseen by the adherents of bipartisanship.\n\nThe informal bipartisan handling of the problems arising from Germany’s partition, including the Berlin question, have undergone serious trials during the past few years. The difficulties which arose in the wake of the Berlin crisis and the attempts of the German Democratic Republic to improve its international status were mostly not interparty disputes but rather divergences within the Union parties and within the SPD.\n\nThe first formidable test for the fledgling bipartisanship was presented on August 13, 1961, when the Berlin Wall rose in the former German capital to divide its eastern and western halves. No initiative to take physical countermeasures was suggested by Chancellor Adenauer to the three protecting powers of West Berlin. It remains a matter for conjecture whether the absence of any such measures was the result of Bonn’s passivity or of a lack of initiative by Washington—or both. Probably both Adenauer and President Kennedy (or Secretary of State Rusk, who discussed the matter over the telephone with the President in Hyannisport) decided independently to practice restraint in this matter.68 The CDU/CSU leaders, with few exceptions, shared the Chancellor’s reluctance to seek an Allied action which might have precipitated an even more serious crisis. This reluctance was tacitly approved by the SPD leadership.69 But the SPD’s Berlin organization, headed by Mayor Willy Brandt, urged active resistance of the rising Wall.70 On August 16, Adenauer received Andrei A. Smirnov, the Soviet Ambassador, who conveyed Khrushchev’s message to the Chancellor expressing hope that nothing would be done to aggravate the situation, an assurance gladly given.71\n\nOn August 18, Adenauer made a declaration before the Bundestag which was in sharp contrast with a speech delivered by Willy Brandt on the same day before the same forum.72 But the governing Mayor of Berlin received scant help from his Party colleagues. The situation was, nevertheless, believed to be critical in West Berlin. After the usual protest notes, it was realized, both in Washington and in Bonn, that certain limited (and belated) actions were needed to reassure the West’s Berlin stronghold. Troop reinforcements, the lining up of American and British tanks along the Wall, and General Clay’s and Vice-President Johnson’s arrival in Berlin restored morale but could not affect the complete partition of the city. The bipartisan policy helped to bail out the Chancellor; and, during the election campaign prior to the September 17, 1961, elections, the SPD tactfully refrained from exploiting the governmental inaction in Berlin in its own favor. As noted earlier, the election results registered some public censure by reducing CDU/ CSU parliamentary representation and increasing the votes for SPD candidates. The voters must have felt that the government had not been seriously concerned to prevent the erection of the Wall. Thanks to Willy Brandt’s performance, the SPD was, undeservingly, credited with having proposed effective countermeasures. The Free Democrats (who had been rather critical of Adenauer’s inaction) increased their voting strength considerably.\n\nIn April and May, 1962, during the delicate and often acrimonious exchanges between the United States and the Federal Republic on the “package deal” (an American plan for establishing an international authority to control the access routes to Berlin, augmented by a nonaggression commitment between East and West and bilateral East-West German committees), the SPD observed calm understanding. The American plan had caused a major dissension between the “hard” group of the CDU/CSU, led by former Foreign Minister von Brentano and the “flexibles” supporting Foreign Minister Schröder; the former were in strong opposition to the plan while Schröder was inclined to align himself with the United States in this matter. The Chancellor adopted a practical approach; he was confident anyhow that the Soviet government would reject the “package.” He also relied on the French, who rejected it without much ado.\n\nThe “package deal” plan had become known through an “indiscretion” probably managed by Von Brentano73 and had aroused indignation in the ruling SPD circles in Berlin. The treatment of the issue remained bipartisan, though, of course, there were adherents and opponents to be found in both the CDU/CSU and the SPD.\n\nThe Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty of August 5, 1963, gave rise to serious conflicts within the Union parties, coinciding with frictions that had emerged between the Berlin SPD organization and the CDU branch in that city.\n\nThe Treaty of Moscow provided for accession by any state signing it in one of the capitals of the three original signatory powers: the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Under this accession clause the German Democratic Republic could enter this multilateral convention by signing it in Moscow. The draft treaty was known to the Federal Foreign Office but its attention had not been drawn, prior to the initialing of the Treaty, to the accession clause.\n\nBoth the governmental coalition parties and the SPD expressed discontent because of this precedent which, they thought, might be interpreted as an indirect or implicit recognition of the East German state. For a moment it seemed questionable that the Federal Republic would be willing to sign the Treaty. However, talks and exchanges between Washington and Bonn, and Bonn and London, led to official disclaimers on the part of the American and British governments that the accession in Moscow of the German Democratic Republic could be taken as recognition. The Bonn government also joined in this denial. But the action raised the prospect of other, more consequential, treaties, such as the suggested convention against surprise attack, which would provide for inspections on both sides of the Iron Curtain and would require adherence by the German Democratic Republic.\n\nThe interparty Berlin dispute arose as a result of speeches made by Willy Brandt and his press chief, Egon Bahr, before the Evangelical Academy in Tutzing (Bavaria) in July, 1963. The two addresses, especially Bahr’s, contained hints for a limited rapprochement with the East German regime, suggesting an abandonment of the official nonrecognition policy.74 The former Mayor and Chairman of the Berlin CDU, Franz Amrehn, published a scathing criticism of these speeches in the CDU’s Party release, which was then taken up by the daily press. Amrehn wished to refute the argument that a material improvement of life in the German Democratic Republic would be conducive to relaxation; he wrote that the greatest suffering is not material but is caused by mental, moral, and political pressures. There was clearly a conflict between the humanitarian and the political approaches to reunification.\n\nThe gauntlet was then taken up by SPD Mayor Heinrich Albertz (after 1966 successor to Governing Mayor Brandt) in a memorial speech on the second anniversary of the Wall. Albertz reverted to the earlier SPD phraseology in calling the Federal Republic a “Confederation of the Rhine-State” and “a perfectionist state recently established between the Elbe and the Rhine.” He asked for concrete German proposals to improve the “human situation” in the “Soviet Zone,” unrestrained by the “provincial timidity” of Bonn in considering any contact with East Germany as an “upgrading” of the Democratic Republic.75 This allocution elicited bitter polemics between CDU/CSU and SPD mouthpieces which almost heralded the end of bipartisanship on the question of German unity.76\n\nThe informal bipartisanship was, however, restored by the cooperative attitude of Schröder and by a conciliatory statement of SPD Vice-Chairman Herbert Wehner. The latter, in an interview which he gave to Die Welt on August 30, 1963, denied any intention of seeking an understanding with the East German regime. He brushed aside Bahr’s suggestions as his (Bahr’s) private opinions and admitted that Albertz’ pronouncements were less than fortunate: “I would not have spoken of a Confederation of the Rhine-State, not even in the conditional mood.” He said that the SPD had certain objections against the Berlin clause of the German-Polish Trade Agreement but that it did not wish to initiate a campaign on these grounds, especially because the Treaty had already been signed. He would not accuse the CDU/CSU of “softening tendencies” because of this event.77\n\nIt should be noted that earlier the Berlin SPD had held “harder” views than the Bonn Party Headquarters; after 1961, however, the attitude of the Berlin group had become significantly more “flexible” than that of the national Party leadership.\n\nThe violence of the reciprocal attacks abated and the accession of Ludwig Erhard to the office of Federal chancellor also contributed to the restoration of relative harmony between the two parties. Nevertheless, the opposition within the CDU/CSU of the “hard” and “Gaullist” factions against Schröder was occasionally channeled into attacks against SPD sympathy toward the ideas of the Foreign Minister. Thus, during the Bundestag debates on the ratification of the Test-Ban Treaty in January, 1964 (when the Treaty was called another “Munich” by some inflexibles), CSU Deputy Freiherr von Guttenberg reproached the SPD in words which could or should have been directed against Schröder.78\n\nThe Berlin border-pass question also threatened to divide both the CDU/CSU and the SPD internally. The division between adherents of a humanitarian-flexible approach to this question (e.g., the Berlin SPD) and the hard-line orthodox, who would refuse contacts with the representatives of East Germany, confronted Party leaders in both camps. The national SPD leadership disagreed in many respects with its Berlin organization, while the Berlin CDU supported the “hard” line represented by several factions in Bonn.79 The Bavarian CSU, on the other hand, while being inflexible in many respects did not, generally, oppose “inofficial” contacts with the East for humanitarian reasons. Eventually, cooperation between Chancellor Erhard and Governing Mayor Willy Brandt rendered a bipartisan treatment of this question possible.\n\nIn order to secure the best results from bipartisan collaboration, Foreign Minister Schröder succeeded in establishing a system of consultation with the SPD leaders. He has regularly sought the opinion of the opposition Party’s foreign policy experts, Herbert Wehner and Fritz Erler.80 Furthermore, SPD specialists have frequently collaborated with members of the German Foreign Office. Such co-operation has become possible partly because of the change of the SPD’s attitude, partly because of the more “mobile” policy of the Foreign Minister. But such a concurrence of views between the Foreign Minister and the opposition party has not facilitated Schröder’s task of consultation with elements of his own Party.\n\nThe political chasm which almost since the beginning of the Federal Republic had divided the majority party from its main opposition was closed by the adherence of the SPD to the basic tenets of the government’s reunification policy and definition of the role which the West German state should play in the restoration of German unity. Additionally, the participation of the Federal Republic in the Western defense system was also fully approved. Thereby, all major foreign policy differences were eliminated.\n\nThis loose co-operation, however, failed to satisfy the SPD. They suggested several forms of permanent consultation with the governing parties on questions of foreign policy, or the Deutschlandpolitik, in particular. The elimination of substantive policy differences opened the chance that even a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD, with or without the FDP, might be contemplated.81 When the question of “exchange of speakers” between the SPD and the SED, the Communist party of East Germany, came up in the spring of 1966, the need for joint decision prompted Chancellor Erhard to convoke the first “Germany discussion” on April 21, 1966, with the participation of the three parliamentary parties of the Federal Republic.\n\nIn March, 1966, the Central Committee of the SED sent an “Open Letter to the Delegates of the Dortmund Party Conference” of the SPD, signed by Walter Ulbricht, in his capacity as first secretary of the Communist party of East Germany, inviting the West German Social Democrats to join in a conference to promote better understanding and to prepare joint action against “the Bonn revanchists and imperialists.”82\n\nThe SPD replied with another “Open Letter” in which it emphasized its loyalty to the text and principles of the Basic Law and questioned whether useful talks could be conducted with the ruling party of East Germany as long as Germans were prevented by walls, minefields, and barbed wire from visiting each other and while those who tried to cross the border were being shot under the orders of the Communist government. The SPD was ready to discuss the problems of Germany but only under certain conditions. The correspondence, however, continued, and the suggestion that leaders of both parties should hold joint meetings on both sides of the demarcation line was accepted. The first public discussions were to be held in Karl-Marx Stadt in East Germany and, subsequently, in Hanover in the Federal Republic. SPD Chairman Brandt, together with the Vice-Chairmen, Erler and Wehner, were to participate in these meetings, which were to be given full publicity on both sides of the Iron Curtain.83\n\nThe SPD was acting in agreement with the government when it accepted the suggestion to embark on this venture; it did so partly in loyalty to the bipartisan policy and partly because it suspected that the real purpose of Ulbricht was to drive a wedge between the Social Democrats and the government of the Federal Republic. Erhard stipulated only that no high government official should take part in the discussions with the SED and that these contacts were not to affect the accepted basic position on the German question. The interparty conference also gave its blessing to the SPD’s affair with the SED.84 In the CDU/CSU some of the “hard-liners” criticized the project; others again wished to take further initiatives so as to prevent the SPD from reaping alone the fruits of their action: the ending of a deadlock in the Deutschlandpolitik.85\n\nThe exchange of speakers could not have been arranged without the consent of Bonn because the entry of SED leaders raised points of criminal law: these leaders were considered responsible for the shootings along the border and, as German nationals under the prevailing doctrine, could be arrested and sentenced according to the criminal code. Special amnesties were needed to secure their safety from prosecution.86 The Temporary Immunity Act passed by the Bundestag subsequently served as a pretext for Ulbricht to call off the exchange of speakers.\n\nUntil mid-1966, the bipartisan line on the Deutschlandpolitik, despite intraparty cleavages, operated reasonably well. It was not even sorely tested in the election campaign preceding the 1965 Federal elections. However, the fissures within the CDU/CSU—centering mainly around the reunification policy issue, various initiatives taken by the SPD, and ensuing acrimonous polemics—created a political malaise which threatened, by the summer of 1966, to end all collaboration.\n\nA series of humiliating reverses which Erhard sustained after leading his Party to victory in 1965 shook his coalition cabinet some ten months later. The partnership with the Free Democrats, always cumbersome for Adenauer, proved to be fateful for the second Federal Chancellor. The internal splits within the FDP on the reunification issue have often been embarrassing in the past to those who tried to collaborate with them.\n\nThe FDP and the Reunification\n\nThe Free Democratic party has always been a divided party—on practically all issues. It included so-called southern liberals, mainly from Baden-Württemberg, who had been inspired by the ideas of the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848; economic liberals of the Manchester school; and all shades of nationalists of the Weimar era. The question of German unity was probably the only theme on which all Party factions concurred in demanding a more active achievement policy. But the leaders of the FDP hardly ever saw eye-to-eye on how this unification policy was to be implemented, and many of them changed their opinions over time.\n\nIn 1949, at the first Bundestag elections, the FDP obtained fifty-two seats. The CDU/CSU, with a mere plurality of 139 seats, had to seek coalition partners. Adenauer invited the FDP into his cabinet, and the SPD with its 131 seats was forced into opposition. But the Free Democrats proved to be difficult partners. There were, especially, two areas in which the FDP opposed governmental policy: social legislation and the West European involvement. The latter was considered by the FDP, and by the SPD, as delaying or blocking reunification.\n\nAt the 1953 elections the CDU/CSU increased its Bundestag representation to 243 (and the SPD, to 151), mainly to the detriment of smaller parties. But Adenauer was still compelled to rely on the 48 FDP deputies for a controlling majority in the assembly. But this time the Chancellor refused to recall to his cabinet the most recalcitrant FDP leader, former Minister of Justice Thomas Dehler. Thereafter, the FDP was already half way in opposition, though it had some ministers serving in the government. Dehler had been elected chairman of the Party. In February, 1956, the FDP overthrew the CDU-led state government of North Rhine-Westphalia by joining the SPD opposition. The Party then split; sixteen deputies joined the CDU/CSU while the rest went, also on the federal level, into opposition.\n\nThe FDP had always been critical of the Chancellor’s Germany policy; it is to be remembered that one of the Party’s deputies, Karl Georg Pfleiderer, had presented reunification projects of his own back in 1952.87 In 1953 the election slogan of the Party had been “First Germany, then Europe.”88 Although this emphasis on nationalism and German unity strengthened the cohesion of the FDP, its views on internal politics were hopelessly split between a socially minded group (the so-called “Young Turks”) and the irreconcilable bourgeois liberals who, for example, had announced that they would do away with the “social achievements” in East Germany when the day of unification arrived. The 1957 elections reduced the number of FDP deputies in the Bundestag to forty-one.\n\nDuring the full third term of the legislature the FDP remained in opposition. Their main topic of criticism against the government was Adenauer’s abortive reunification policy. The Soviet attempts to obtain control over West Berlin and, finally, the erection of the Berlin Wall, gave them ample material for chiding the Chancellor. Their suggested policies were, however, neither uniform nor consistent, nor even realistic. Thomas Dehler was succeeded in the chairmanship of the Party by Reinhold Maier in January, 1957; in 1960 he was replaced by Erich Mende, one of the “Young Turks.” Mende, once a fervent supporter of “East-West talks” (in 1956 he participated in discussions with leaders of the East German bogus Liberal Democratic party in Weimar and was severely attacked for it at that time), in 1960 still advocated such contacts together with the neutralization of a united Germany and the complete restoraion of the 1937 frontiers.89\n\nThe Free Democrats, possibly under the impact of the Berlin Wall, were able to increase their Bundestag representation to sixty-seven at the 1961 elections. The CDU/CSU was now compelled again to look for coalition partners. The FDP, after considerable hesitation and against the views of many of its influential members, agreed to participate again in the Adenauer government. The alternative could only have been an alliance between the SPD and the FDP; Mende had, in fact, pursued conversations to this effect with the Social Democratic leaders. But the influence of big industry, which had financed FDP’s election campaign, led the Party to help Adenauer once again. Among the conditions which the FDP stipulated as a price for its collaboration were a more active reunification policy, including a plan to ask the three Western powers to open negotiations with the Russians, and even direct talks eventually between the Federal Republic and Moscow. Mende himself refrained from joining the new cabinet.\n\nShortly after the formation of the new Adenauer government, a Soviet memorandum of December 27, 1961, was presented to the Federal government. This long document, couched in carefully worded ambiguities, addressed flatteries to German talent and industry, alluded to the usefulness of past co-operation, and expressed hopes for similar collaboration in the future. It described in glittering colors the possibilities of Soviet-German reciprocal trade and, without giving up the Soviet theses on East Germany and Berlin, suggested direct talks on the Berlin issue between Bonn and Moscow.90\n\nThe Soviet memorandum caused a major shock in the coalition. The Free Democrats first suggested that the time had now come for Adenauer to live up to his commitment and agree to a bilateral talk with the Soviet Union. But the Chancellor refused; he was skeptical, as before, of Soviet sincerity. He had been trying hard, ever since the abortive outcome of the 1959 Geneva Conference, to persuade the United States to restrict its “exploratory talks” (conducted alternatively in Moscow and in Washington) to the technical aspects of the Berlin question and not to undertake meaningful negotiations on the East-West German problem as long as the Soviets insisted on the participation of the German Democratic Republic. He foresaw that if the bilateral talks were not limited to the Berlin question on which, in his view, the Western Allies, and not the Federal government, were primarily competent to negotiate, they would lead to a discussion of the German question which, under the terms of the Soviet memorandum, could result only in an “upgrading” or even recognition of the East German regime. And even if these bilateral negotiations were conducted with close consultation, they would expose the Federal government to Soviet pressures or evoke sinister memories of Rapallo and the Hitler-Stalin Pact in the minds of Western leaders.91\n\nEventually, the Chancellor’s arguments partly satisfied Erich Mende, though not the popular leader of the Party, Thomas Dehler. On February 21, 1962, the Federal government replied with another lengthy memorandum explaining the German point of view. It claimed to share the Soviet view that a genuine reconciliation of the two countries would banish the danger of war in Europe. But it also stated: “German-Soviet relations can only be normalized if the situation of the German people is normalized. What is abnormal is the division of the German people, what is especially abnormal are the conditions in the so-called German Democratic Republic and just as abnormal is the wall in Berlin. These are the problems that must be solved if we are to improve German-Soviet relations.”92\n\nThus, the West German memorandum did not deny the usefulness of bilateral talks but suggested preliminary exchanges of view on the basis of the principles laid down in the text. This response to the Soviet initiative was, after some argument, accepted by Erich Mende, but not without “extensive soul-searching” in the FDP. Mende followed the Social Democratic example by admitting that many of his Party’s earlier ideas on reunification had become “outdated.”93\n\nThis event demonstrates the existing split within the ranks of the Free Democrats over the Deutschlandpolitik. After the dispatch of the German memorandum, Thomas Dehler, then Vice-President of the Bundestag, did not hesitate to accuse the CDU/CSU of having violated the coalition agreement. The bipartisanship between the Union parties and the SPD on the policy for reunification had not made the FDP’s task easier: before the Social Democratic changeover they professed to stand on the reunification issue, as well as on other issues, midway between the views of the other two major parties. For instance, Reinhold Maier, then chairman of the FDP, stated on behalf of his Party in October, 1958, that they would never adhere to the CDU priority of the integration of “Little Europe” over Germany’s reunification, nor would they adhere to the tendencies within the SPD to place the policy for reunification above the quest for the unity of Europe as a whole.94 The FDP was always unable to convert the coalition and the government to the views held by its more nationalist and less pro-Western wing. With a basic understanding existing between the Union parties and the SPD, the FDP could hope even less to have its weight felt on the question of German unity.\n\nThe divergence of views on the Deutschlandpolitik between different factions of the FDP is considerably deeper than within either the CDU/CSU or the SPD. In fact, some of the FDP’s internal conflicts are insurmountable. For instance, a member of the rightist wing of the Free Democrats, Bundestag Deputy Ernst Achenbach, who has a Nazi past and was involved in the Naumann Plot of 1953,95 persuaded the Foreign Policy Preparatory Committee of his Party to submit a proposal to the Party Congress to be held in Munich in the summer of 1963 inviting the four former occupation powers to convoke, without delay, a new conference on Germany with the participation of “both parts of Germany,” of Poland, and Czechoslovakia.96\n\nThomas Dehler, a Bavarian liberal with commendable record during the Nazi era, always opposed Adenauer’s concept of an automatic reunification. He never credited the Chancellor with genuinely wanting reunification and considered integration of West Germany into the European Economic Community and the Atlantic alliance as measures blocking the path to German unity. He denied that Adenauer, or the Western powers acting on the Chancellor’s advice, had ever seriously tried to come to grips with the Soviets in negotiating the German question. The policy of strength was an error; and the more the Federal Republic became entangled in European and Atlantic commitments, the more difficult it would be to satisfy Soviet demands in return for German unification. Dehler favored direct West German-Soviet talks which could discover the real Soviet price for reunification.97 Thomas Dehler visited the Soviet Union in September, 1963, and had conversations with Khrushchev and Foreign Minister Gromyko. He was told that he had been right in considering the establishment of the Federal Republic as having prevented unification of his country. But since this mistake had been committed, the fact of two (or three, when including West Berlin) Germanys had to be recognized and reunification had to be negotiated between them. Germany’s division was a result of the lost war and of Bonn’s mistaken policy. Despite this frustrating insight into Soviet political thinking, Dehler continued to advocate direct German-Soviet conversations.98\n\nWhen, after Adenauer’s retirement, Ludwig Erhard formed his cabinet on October 17, 1963, the coalition between the CDU/CSU and the FDP was renewed. Five FDP members entered the new government, including this time Erich Mende, the Party chairman. He became not only the Vice-Chancellor but also Minister of All-German Affairs in recognition of the special interest of the junior coalition partner in matters of German unity.\n\nThe FDP’s electoral success in 1961 proved to be temporary; when the Germans went to the polls in 1965, the FDP could muster only 9.5 per cent of the votes as against 12.8 per cent in 1961. Nevertheless, its participation in the coalition cabinet continued and so did the feud between Erich Mende and many of the CDU/CSU leaders, especially Franz Josef Strauss. On the whole, Mende and his faction within the Free Democrats wished to give a much more liberal interpretation to West Germany’s principal position with regard to the reunification issue. Thus, the Vice-Chancellor would have preferred that the Bonn government negotiate the border pass agreement with East Germany, instead of leaving this matter, to save the principle of nonrecognition, to the Berlin Senate.99 Mende and his group urged the opening of “contacts,” “talks,” or “colloquies” with the German Democratic government “on all levels,” which they refused to consider “negotiations” for fear of implying recognition of the regime. Such moves were much against the taste of even the “soft” ones in the CDU/CSU. Strangely enough, Mende managed to combine his “flexibility” with certain rigid, highly conservative views, such as his insistence on the continued legal existence of the German Reich.100 He saw no inconsistency in declaring, on the one hand, that the Hallstein Doctrine was obsolete, but demanding, on the other, the “sole right of representation” of Germany for the Federal Republic. He also pointed out that one day it might be possible for the Federal government “to confer”—if not negotiate—with the East German regime provided that such talks were conducted at the behest of the four former occupation powers of Germany.101\n\nIn the spring of 1966 the FDP was eager to take advantage of the possibilities of a “German dialogue.” Even before the SPD was ready to accept a conference with the SED, the FDP Vice-Chairman, Wolfgang Mischnik, took part, for the first time since the division of Germany, in a televised discussion with the leaders of its splinter-branch in the German Democratic Republic, the so-called Liberal Democratic party.102 The FDP has also sponsored, since 1959, the establishment of mixed commissions between East and West German officials—at all levels.103\n\nWhether the initiatives of the FDP, as an opposition party, will result in a more active Deutschlandpolitik, including direct talks with the Soviets, and whether such talks will be more productive than Thomas Dehler’s experience in Moscow must remain a matter of conjecture. Any movement along the congealed front of reunification may be fruitfully exploited by the Free Democrats because their members have submitted so many plans in the past: the authorship of any of these projects, if revived and adopted, could be claimed by the junior coalition party or one of its factions.\n\nProbably to establish for itself greater maneuverability on the German issue, the Free Democratic party withdrew its ministers from the Erhard cabinet on October 27, 1966, and, once more, ended the coalition with the CDU/CSU. The official reason given for this withdrawal was opposition to the Chancellor’s fiscal policy measures; but, as in almost every political question of the Federal Republic, it was the German problem which loomed over the secession of the Free Democrats, a step which two weeks later led to the resignation of the Chancellor and his cabinet.\n\nAfter Erhard—The Grand Coalition\n\nAmong the various factors and events which caused the eclipse of Chancellor Erhard, his reluctance or inability to launch meaningful initiatives for the promotion of German unity played an outstanding role. Adenauer, with his reputation as an architect of new Germany, was able to survive, at least for a number of years, without mustering any step forward toward the unification of his country. But Erhard, the contriver of West Germany’s “economic miracle,” whose prestige had already been undermined before his accession to the chancellorship, was unable to refute the longstanding doubts as to his political skills. Eventually, he proved unsuccessful even in the field of finance by running into difficulties about a budget deficit and about offset payments for the maintenance of United States and British forces in Germany. The elections in the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in July and those in Hesse in November, 1966, favored the Social Democrats. These votes may also have reflected an increased popularity which the SPD has gained by their adroit exploitation of the cause of German unity.104\n\nFor the solution of the West German governmental crisis in November, 1966, different alternatives were available: the former partnership between the CDU/CSU and the FDP but under a new chancellor could be re-established; the much-heralded “Grand Coalition” between the CDU/CSU and the SPD could be set up; and, finally, for the first time in the eighteen years’ existence of the Federal Republic, the CDU/CSU could be unseated from its governmental position if a coalition between the SPD and the FDP could be forged. Such a partnership would only dispose of a thin six-vote majority in the Bundestag which, in view of the lax discipline prevailing in the ranks of the Free Democrats, seemed insufficient. Of course, if the fifteen Social Democrat deputies from Berlin were able to vote, the majority of the SPD-FDP combination would be impressive. But under the reservations of the three Western military governors which saddled the Basic Law at the time of its acceptance by the Parliamentary Council the deputies from Berlin were not entitled to vote (except on procedural questions, as developed by practice). Thus, the status of Berlin impinged on the developments of West German internal politics.105\n\nThe cause of the governmental crisis was, partly, a personal one: the majority of the CDU/CSU leadership, beset by dissensions mostly relative to the handling of the reunification issue, decided to select another chancellor. Erhard was not again to head the new cabinet also because the FDP refused to accept his leadership. But as soon as Erhard declared his readiness to withdraw, the importance of a future political program, to be agreed upon by the parties which would form a new governmental coalition, came into prominence. In the course of the discussions over Erhard’s heritage, the SPD and FDP were able to crystallize some of their basic positions. The Social Democrats made it clear that their participation in either the Grand Coalition with the CDU/CSU or in a “small coalition” with the FDP would be conditional on the acceptance of certain foreign policy positions such as a clarification of the Federal Republic’s relations with both Washington and Paris, the renunciation of any West German nuclear sharing in NATO, “normalization” of West Germany’s relations with her “East European neighbors,” the promotion of some forms of “organized coexistence” with the German Democratic Republic, and a clear attitude on problems concerning Berlin.106\n\nAs far as the FDP was concerned, its Chairman, Erich Mende, already as Vice-Chancellor and Minister of All-German Affairs in the Erhard cabinet, had proposed the establishment of full diplomatic contacts with the East European countries, going beyond the respective plans of the Social Democrats. Now his Party advocated a policy “more in keeping with the sober facts of the East-West situation” making an end to “all dreams and illusions.” Hans-Dietrich Genscher, chairman of the FDP parliamentary group, declared: “The German Problem cannot be solved without the "
