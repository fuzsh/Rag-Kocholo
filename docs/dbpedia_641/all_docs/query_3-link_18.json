In some cases where an English translation appears to be inadequate the German terminology has been parenthesized following the English. Use of the word \"Chief\": In many cases throughout this handbook the word \"Chief\" has been omitted because constant repetition of the word not only obscured the appearance of the page, but seemed unnecessary. In all cases, the name following the office title is the name of the 25X1C3b1 chief of that office. 25X1X6 Approved For Release 1999/09/911168101114W78-02646R000500100002-0 Approved For Release 1999/09/07 : CIA- 78-02646R000500100002-0 TABTF OF CONTENTS The Volkskammer Page 1 The Laenderkammer 14 The Presidium of the Council of Ministers 19 Council of Ministers of the GDR 21 The Office of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers 27 The Office of the President of the GER 37 The Office of the Minister-President 39 Supreme Court 41 Supreme Prosecutor's Office 42 Central Commission for State Control 43 Deputy Minister-President Offices 44 Office for Youth Matters 45 Office for Liaison with Churches 46 Offices Subordinate to the Minister-President 47 Committee of German Unity (ADE) 55 Committee for Promotion of Leading Servants of the State ..........59 The State Planning Commission 62 State Central Administration for Statistics 64 Central Office for Research and Technology (ZAFT) 72 Office for Scientific-Technical Cooperation (WTZ) 76 Office for Patents and Inventions 80 State Secretariat for Local Economy 82 State Committee for Material Procurement 84 vii Approved For Release 1999/09kri?: 0-02646R000500100002-0 Approved For Release 1999/09/07 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000500100002-0 TABU, OF CONTENTS (cont 'a) Page State Geological Commission 91 Office for Standardization 95 The State Radio Commission 97 The Chamber of Technology 111 Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry 115 Ministry for Chemical Industry 123 Ministry of Coal and Power 129 Ministry of Construction 135 Ministry for Culture 149 State Commission for Art 151 Office for Literature and Publishing Matters 154 Ministry for Public Education 157 Central Institute for Pedagogy 163 Ministry of Finance 170 Deutsche Investitionsbank 183 Deutsche Notenbank 184 Ministry for Food Industry 195 Ministry for Foreign Affairs 205 Diplomatic Missions 221 GDR Trade and Diplomatic Missions to Foreign Nations 221 Foreign Diplomatic Missions Accredited to the GDR 234 Ministry of Foreign and Internal German Trade 244 Office for Custom and Control of Freight Traffic 246 Chamber for Foreign Trade 258 viii Approved For Release 1999/0901itormliWOOP78-02646R000500100002-0 Approved For Release 1999/09/07 : CIA-RDP78-02646R000500100002-0 RTnTfl7flWflflt AT TABU, OF CONTENTS (cont 'd) Page Chamber for Industry and Commerce 265 Ministry for General Machine Construction 269 Ministry for Public Health 277 East German Red Cross 279 Ministry for Heavy Machine Construction 281 Industrial Requirements, Main Administration for (see former Ministry for Machine Construction) 281 Ministry of the Interior 289 Main Administration for Peoples Police (1-1VDVP) 289 Main Administration for Finance and Organization 291 Deputy Minister for Armed Forces 292 Office for Technical Matters 301 Publishing House of the Ministry of the Interior 302 State Secretariat for Internal Affairs 305 Main Administration for Industrial Requirements (see forMer Ministry of Machine Construction) 305 Ministry for Justice 313 Ministry for Labor and Vocational Training 319 Ministry for Light Industry 326 Ministry for Machine Construction (prior to dissolution) 335 Ministry of Mines and Ore Smelting 355 Ministry for Post and Telecommunications ... 359 State Secretariat for the Administration of State Reserves 369 Pik i -rk si-t 471 4L4V.V n ix 77?

In the future it is planned to allow only those proposals to appear on the agenda of the Council which are of basic political and econOmic inter- est. The Minister Council must be set free from the duty of formal approval of proposals, which only leads to many ministers and state secretaries at- tempting to cause the Council to assume the responsibilities which are rightfully those of the minister or the state secretary himself. Each min- ister and state secretary must analyse each proposal which he wishes to bring before the Council of Ministers or its Presidium to determine if their decision on the proposal is really necessary. The Office of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers is charged with the examination of all proposals before they are included in the agendas. In the future the initiator of the proposal must include with the proposal an explanation of what laws, ordinances, or decisions previously passed apply to the pro- posal being submitted. The Office of the Presidium will work Mit the questions of the form of the proposal and its supporting documents so as to provide a proposal upon which decision can be readily rendered.

They take these conditions to be natural, put up with them, and thus the conditions continue. It is not possible to get from this State Secretariat any integrated figures pertaining to local industry.

Dr. Werner Lange, Chief of ZAFT, was interested in standardization work. :At that time, Ervin Goepel was the chief of this Division. When Eberhard Arlt re- placed Goepel, Lange gave up his supervisory interest in the Division. Arlt was subsequently able to develop this Division gradually into an inde- pendent office culminating in its being declared by law an independent agency of the State Planning Commission as of 1 Nov 54. An enormous staff to run the Office for Standardization must be hired and trained before effective standardization work, all of which is to be centrally controlled, can begin. There are to be no independent standard- ization commissions studying specific problems, as is the case; in the West German Standardization Commission. Instead, the East German commissions will be government-appointed to prepare standards as directed by the ap- pointing government agency. It is also planned to appoint standardization engineers in the various government-owned industrial enterprises. A ration is to be set up whereby one standardization engineer is to be used to a certain number of employees (actual number as yet unknown).
