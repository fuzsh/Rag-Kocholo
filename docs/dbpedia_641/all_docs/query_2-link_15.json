        "text": "BONN, Oct. 21—Chancellor Willy Brandt, marking his first 12 months in office today, dis missed predictions by the Par liamentary opposition that his Government would soon top ple. He vowed to serve out his term ending in 1973.\n\nIn a newspaper interview he also threatened to make his controversial policy of rap prochement with Eastern Eu rope the subject of a referen dum to show the opposition that the majority of West Ger mans supported him.\n\n“I am no prophet,” he told the Telegraf of West Berlin, which is close to his Social Democratic party, “but I can give you my evaluation of the situation and that is the fol lowing: The coalition will up hold its agreed alliance and will put its agreed program into effect. In 1973 the citizens can decide at the ballot box whe ther or not we have done good work.”\n\nThe threat to Mr. Brandt's co alition comes from his partner party, the Free Democrats, three of whose members of Parliament defected to the Christian Democratic Union parties earlier this month. This cut his majority in the Bundes tag from 12 to 6 votes. The Christian Democrat Union is now trying to lure more Free Democrats away and thus cause the coalition to collapse."
