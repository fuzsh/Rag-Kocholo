New York 22, N. Y. Winter-Spring, 1957 IDag!Pvt ,cad' 61*,0A u1c.~;t, EASTERN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST The spirit of freedom beckons the satellite nations of Eastern Europe. The death-like silence of the past 11 years has been smashed. The historic up- heavals in Poland and Hungary show clearly that the peoples of these lands were never reconciled to the ruthless overlordship of the Kremlin. By their dauntless opposition they have unmasked the Soviet despotism and have given new hope to others who have shared their tragic plight. However, candor compels us to state that we have watched the intrepid struggle of the Poles and the Hungarians with mixed emotion. We have been troubled by the thought that the sacrifices of these peoples may be in vain. Yet, we cannot help but feel that developments in Eastern Europe hold great promise, if only the U. S. and her Allies discard stereotype approaches to the problem of European freedom.. Current Allied propaganda seems to be character- ized by an, almost conceited belief that the only barrier standing between the Soviet satellites and their ' desire to seek friendship with the West are the Russian tanks. It has been made to appear as though a gigantic propaganda campaign, developed by our best advertising and public relations experts, is sufficient to \"win over\" the peoples of Eastern Europe and to relieve them of the intolerable Rus- sian occupation. No matter how well conceived this, propaganda may be in terms of techniques, it is at best a palliative and at worst may turn out to be a source of disillusionment which could strangle the cause of freedom. The peoples of Eastern Europe need less of \"moral support\" and more of a realistic long-term policy by the Allied powers and in particular the USA. The struggle for freedom in Eastern Europe is not an abstract concept. Those who give their blood for this mighty cause must have a perspective, for in this fight the burning question inevitably arises: After freedom-what? It is to this question that our policy makers must devote their energies. They must be able to answer in terms that make sense to the peoples of Eastern Europe. Not so long ago these brave nations were lan- guishing under the jackboot heel of German mili- tarism and Nazism. Their lands were laid waste, their farms and factories wrecked, and millions of their kin incinerated in the hells of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, etc. History tells us how the \"inferior\" nations of the East were enslaved by the Prussian warlords. On other occasions The Russian Czars, operating under the guise of Pan-Slavism, tried to absorb them in their Empire. There were other times when the power of the German eagle and the Rus- sian bear more or less balanced each other. In such instances the Kaiser and the Czar would join hands and carve up neighboring peoples in the name of \"mutual interests.\" The Hitler-Stalin marriage de convenance was but the continuation of this latter policy, ? What shall it be this time? Will the bright vista of freedom from Russian hegemony turn out to he the cloak for a new master, the Germans? Or will this \"freedom\" be \"guaranteed\" by the combined power and mutual understanding of the Russian bear and the German eagle. Whichever the case, it is obvious that the peoples of Eastern Europe would find themselves in chains again. These tragic alternatives are by no means inevita- ble if the West, in the words of Walter Lippmann, discard the \"old stale shibboleths about Germany and the satellite countries.\" The Society has fre- quently stated that the rebuilding of Germany's war potential and military might \"strengthens the Soviet Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 grip over her Eastern satellites whose peoples dread the resurgence of the German power which dcv- as-ated their lands.\" (\"German Realities,\" No. 42, Summer Issue 1953 of PREVENT WORLD WAR III, inserted in the Congressional Record by Senator Wayne Morse, 8-3-53.) It is precisely this contradic- tion-the desire to see freedom in Eastern Europe and rehabilitating the German powerhouse, which threatens to negate the sacrifices of the Hungarians, Poles, and the other peoples oppressed by the Soviet tyranny. The net effect of this dualism in US policy is to obstruct the growth of friendship and under- standing between ourselves and the satellite nations. \"To believe that the peoples of Europe will move closer to the US when they behold the rhythmic marching of a new Wehrmacht, is to expect a miracle.\" (\"The Failure of Diplomacy,\" No. 45, Winter Issue 1954-1955 of PREVENT WORLD WAR III.) Those who are under Russian subjugation today do not want a German master tomorrow. That is why freedom in Eastern Europe is in reality part and parcel of the general problem of European security. Unfortunately, US policy under Secretary Dulles, fails to see this truism. In October 1956 the State Department addressed a note to the Bonn Govern- ment which said in part that \"a sound system of European security.... can be achieved only if Ger- many is reunited.\" The facts of life do not support this contention. The unity of Germany is but one aspect of the problem of European security. We did not fight World War 11 for the unification of Ger- many but rather for the security and peace of Europe and our own country. That security and peace, above all, must first be assured. Secretary Dulles' position is precisely one of the shibboleths about Germany. There is another shibboleth, namely, that a power- ful Germany is the most reliable bulwark against Russian totalitarianism. History proves the reverse. When both, Germany and Russia, were relatively equal in strength, mutual agreements were reached always at the expense of the small nations of Europe. The peoples of Eastern Europe earnestly want the friendship of the West, but let no one he mis- taken that this desire will per se bear fruit. \"If the United States appears in Europe as the sponsor of Western Germany, it will never achieve a new relationship with Poland or Hungary or Czechoslo- vakia....\" (Prof. Geoffrey Barraclough, professor of international affairs at the Royal Institute of In- ternational Affairs; The Nation,12-1-56.) Walter Lippmann had this in mind when he wrote: \"A European policy is urgently needed to provide a framework of guarantees within which the occupied European countries can be made sale against their neighbors and safe for their neighbors. It is impossible to imagine the end of the military occupation, which remains from the World War, except reithit a European sytsem of security\" (New York Herald Tribune, 12-11-56). Toward the estab- lishment of such a system of European security the Society proposed in the No. 46 issue of PREVENT WORLD WAR III the following steps to be taken with regard to Germany: (a) That both East and West Germany be perma- nently demilitarized under United Nations control. (b) That the territorial integrity of East and West Germany becomes the responsibility of the United Nations. (c) That the United Nations shall establish armed force contingents to be located in the states border- ing Germany for purposes of implementing that responsibility. (d) That both East and West Germany shall pay in. cash to the United Nations a sum in an amount roughly equivalent to the cost of any occupation forces, or any other forces, which would have to be sited on German territory for the protection of peace and the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe. Such funds shall be employed to sup- port the armed forces established by the United Nations for the protection of Germany's territorial integrity. It is our considered judgment that an agreement on Germany along these lines would give concrete assurances to the peoples in Eastern Europe that the winning of their freedom would not wind up in the blind alley of a new tyranny. Indeed, it would rally them still further at this time to oppose the Soviet occupation, The freedom, security and peace of all Europe was a fundamental aim in the fight against the Ger- man aggressors during World War IL We are con- vinced that the magnificent resistance of the Hun- garians and the other peoples of Eastern Europe show that this goal can be reached by dynamic policies. Through the years the Society has devoted much of its attention to European problems and their impact on peace and security. However, we have not for one moment discounted the other burning questions which confront the West. One of these is the Middle East which only a few months ago threat- ened to convulse the world in a new holocaust. Because of the gravity of the situation there, the Society made known its views to the United Nations, to the Government and to the press (see page 24, \"The Middle East Crisis and the United Nations\"). The Society's purpose in making this statement were designed primarily to stimulate action through Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-013158000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-013158000400480012-6 the United Nations for a peaceful solution. In our opinion, the genesis of the Arab-Israeli conflict in- volves many complicated factors. Efforts to achieve a settlement will be seriously impeded if either side prefers to indulge in recriminations and accusations against the other. The Society's main concern has been to get both sides to sit down at the conference table and work out an agreement based on the civ- ilized principle of \"to live and let live.\" We mean this in the very literal sense of the word because millions of innocent lives are at stake. The Middle East is an area where great things have happened in the past. It has also been a region where backwardness, disease and poverty have plagued the inhabitants. Friendship and cooperation between the Arab states and Israel would cause \"the deserts to bloom again\" and bring a measure of pros- perity to these populations who are entitled to their God-given right to enjoy life, free from fear and from want. This is why we have supported the United Na- tions' efforts toward bringing about a peaceful solu- tion. This objective can be reached more speedily by the renunciation of propaganda which enflames the emotions, maintains prejudices, and creates blind hatred. The atmosphere for negotiations becomes clouded when responsible leaders speak in a war- like vein. For example, the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Burhanuddin Bashayan, recently declared in a broadcast: \"Israel as a state was built on aggression and cannot live but on aggression. Therefore, its removal from the Middle East is essential.... The time is ripe for regaining Palestine in a manner outlined in Iraq's note (of Nov. 13 to UN mem- bers). The Iraqi government insisted on the uproot- ing.and removal of Israel from the Middle East and forcing the usurpers to return to where they came from\" (Reuters, 12-5-56). Such outbursts cannot contribute toward a SOJ1LI- tion of the present crisis. A leadership indulging in this type of abuse does not lend dignity or respect to a country which presumably seeks the good will and approbation of the civilized community. Indeed, it displays a deplorable irresponsibility in the con- duct of foreign relations that can only lead to further aggravation of the existing dangers. Those leaders who purvey poisonous propaganda help to create a climate of blind hatred which may prove to be uncontrollable among peoples who are kept ignorant as to the real state of affairs. AS a result a change from a policy of hostility to one of peace and mutual accommodation becomes virtually impossible, even when the long term interests of the country concerned require it. When a people are? infected by artificially whipped up hatred, those who are responsible for this state of mind becomee prisoners of it. They are no longer able to act in a statesmenlike manner which is imperative if the country's welfare is to be safeguarded. World public opinion will never reconcile itself to perpetual hostility between the Arabs and the Israelis. Those who persist in encouraging tension and hatred in the Middle East are working against the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. That is why it is of the greatest urgency that re- sponsible Government leaders the world over, as well as leaders of the major religious faiths, join together in the demand that Israel and her Arab neighbors settle their mutual problems by negotia- tions. We must all bear in mind the wise words of the noted Norwegian staesman, Halyard M. Lange, \"Real world peace is inconceivable without peace in the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East is equally inconceivable without peace between Israel and her Arab neighbors.\" \"GETTING HIS OAR IN\" (Graham \"n The Arkansas Gazette} Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 , Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 THE SOVIET GAMBIT In November 19-10 Berlin was the scene of intense negotiations between tl;e Russians and the Germans. The Hitler-Stalin Pact of the previous year had set the stage for these conversations whose main participants were former Foreign Minister Molotov, Hitler and his Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop. Both, Molotov and von Rib- bentrop regarded the Hitler-Stalin Pact as \"good busi- ness\" for initiating future cooperation on the basis of agreed spheres of influence. In this connection von Ribbentrop spoke about Russia's opportunities in the \"new order of things.\" He referred to the advantages Russia could gain \"in the direction of the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.\" Ribbentrop as- sured Stalin's representative that other \"aspirations\" of Russia in this part of the world were also recognized by Germany. The delimitation of spheres of influence formed an important part of the conversations between Molotov and Hitler. The Fuehrer told Molotov that Russia's adherence to the Rome- Berl in-Tokyo Axis Treaty would help to define the \"special interests\" of the powers concerned. Needless to say, Molotov liked the idea but he insisted that in such a pact the Russians be treated as an equal partner. Furthermore, he expressed the need for a more precise delineration of these spheres of in- fluence. Following his return to Moscow, Molotov outlined to the German Ambassador Russia's \"aspirations\" in more concrete terms. He said that Russia was prepared to accept the Four Power Pact provided, among other things, that it stipulated \"that the area south of Baturn and Baku in the general direction of the Persian Gulf is recognized as the center of the aspirations of the Soviet Union.\" It turned out, however, that the negotiations on this Pact became stalled in the growing climate of mutual suspicions between Hitler and Stalin. By the spring of 1941, the strains between the erstwhile partners increased and in June Hitler gave his signal for the invasion of Russia. Recent events in the area of the Middle East show that the abortive partnership between Germany and Russia may come to life. For 200 years the Russians have dreamed of dominating the Middle East. Sixteen years ago they suffered great disappointment when their German part- ners turned against them. Today, the' situation has changed with bewildering speed. The Russians are in the Middle East with both feet, so to speak and their influence is felt from Cairo to Damascus. Russia's avenue for penetrating the Middle East was Egypt, where the Nasser Government, surrounded by Nazi advisors and well versed in dictatorial rule, wel- comed the Soviets with open arms. In September 1955 Egypt announced to the world that it had completed an arms deal with the Soviet satellite state, Czechoslo- vakia. Nasser later revealed that the deal was, in reality, with Soviet Russia---Egyptian cotton for Soviet arms and tanks. Recent estimates place the figure of this deal in the neighborhood of $250 million. While the Nasser Government hailed this agreement as a stepping stone toward Egyptian independence, it turned out that the Egyptian economy was virtually mort- gaged to the Kremlin. What this has meant in terms of the welfare of the Egyptian people is seen by the fact that her national gold reserves have dropped by one-half billion dollars, while the average per capita income is about $5.60 per month by Nasser's own evaluation. A report in the New York Times (8-26-56) stated that by reason of her barter arrangements with the Soviet bloc, Egypt has now placed her economy \"in a critical state of dislocation.\" Nevertheles, Nasser continued to tell his people and the world that the deal with the Soviets was a triumph over \"imperialism.\" While the Egyptian people required economic help, Nasser gave them Soviet guns and spurred them on with anti-Western slogans. This was all to the liking of Soviet agents in Egypt. As far as the Russians were concerned their chance to convert the Middle East into a satrapy of the Communist empire was the main thing regardless of how this would be achieved. With regard to Soviet policy Senator George H. Bender noted: \"The Russians have everything to gain and noth- ing to lose by dealing with the Arab states. They would like to make Egypt a Russian Mediterranean base. Wars between nations are the Communists' meat. Whatever happens, no matter who wins or loses, communism is always waiting to claim the spoils\" (Congressional Rec- ord, 6-4-56). The Senator warned that a war between Egypt and Israel would be the greatest calamity in that area of the world and urged that the United States exert its influence to prevent the realization of Russian intrgue. Communist penetration in the Middle East involving arms investments supplemented by so-called cultural mis- sions and the exchange of political leaders has made alarming headway. Communist China has become Egypt's largest customer. Egypt has concluded trade deals with most of the members of the Communist bloc. Russian economic aid pledged to Egypt includes the building of a nuclear laboratory in Cairo. The Soviet bloc has sent trade missions to various Arab countries, including Syria, Leba- non, and Yemen. Soviet technicians, politicians, trade, art, sport and religious leaders are being exchanged with the Arab countries. Syria together with Egypt seem to be the major points of Russian concentration. The Syrians, following the example of Egypt, consummated a S80 million barter deal with the Russians for tanks, planes and guns. On March 6, 1956, the first issue of a Communist French- Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 language paper appeared in Damascus. Shortly thereafter a Soviet \"cultural\" mission arrived in Damascus to present the Stalin Peace Award to the Syrian religious leader Sheikh Mohammed Al-Ashmar. On July 25, 1956, the Syrian Prime Minister was quoted to the effect that Russian technicians were ex- pected to arrive in Syria to advise on elevators and other installations in connection with the export of cereals. One of Europe's best-informed correspondents, Sefton Delmer, wrote recently in the London Daily Express: \"In my many visits since the war to Syria and to its Arab neighbors in Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan, I have been forcibly impressed by the progress made by the Soviets in Syria since the war as compared with the other Middle Eastern states.\" Mr. Delmer described Syria \"as the most important secret satellite of Moscow in the Middle East\" besides \"the advent of Nasser in Egypt.\" Even the Greek Orthodox Church of Syria, according to Mr. Delmer, is receiving \"subsidies from the Church in Moscow.\" The intense preoccupation of the Russians with the Middle East is indicated by the fact that the Middle East Department of the Soviet Foreign Office is headed by the former Ambassador to the Nasser Government, Daniel Solod, a specialist in political warfare. The mutual attrac- tion between the Soviet dictatorship and the Pan-Arabic leaders was recently described in an editorial by the well- known French newspaper Figaro : \"Birds of a feather f lock together-the old proverb is still true-Marxist totalitari- anism is attracted, as by a magnet, by the apparently oppo- site totalitarianism. Nobody in the world can deny that the Egyptian dictator has imperialistic ambitions. He has proclamed them himself in his Philosophy of Revolution, the Bible of Pan-Arabism. \"Hitler invoked the `living space' necessary, so he said, to the Great Reich. He saw it, in part, in the most pros- perous regions of Soviet Russia. But it does not seem that the projects openly exposed in Mein Kampf disturbed the master of all the Russias. \"Nasser has in his turn intrigued the successors of Stalin, even though he does not hesitate to claim for his own the Moslems living under Soviet law. They think, in fact, that for the moment this is only a side issue, and that the essential thing is to dissociate the Western alli- ance as much as possible by favoring Pan-Arab and Pan- Islam imperialism. If the poker playing of Farouk's suc- cessor succeeds, a wound which will perhaps prove fatal will have been dealt to the free world.... Two enormous continents, Asia and Africa, will have become the proteges of Moscow.\" The Soviet penetration in the Middle East has had a devastating effect on the economic and political position of our main Western allies, Britain and France. The Russians are striving, according to Joseph and Stuart Alsop (12-5-56) to do \"everything in their power to eliminate British interests in the Middle East, thus reduc- ing Britain to a third class power and destroying the Western alliance.\" They warn that Bulganin and Khrush- chev are banking on America's vacillating attitudes to undermine the strength of our allies-and if this is achieved, then the United States will find herself isolated and bereft of strong allies. It has been said in defense of present policy that we must maintain the friendship of the Arab peoples as if such friendship is in contradiction to our historic bonds with France and England. Nothing could be further from the truth. We hold that peace in the Middle East, friend- ship between the Arabs and the United States, and the strengthening of our ties with Britain and France are essential to each other. One of the major factors militating against the realization of these objectives is the rapidly growing influence of the Soviets in the Middle East, thanks to those Arab leaders who hope to employ this influence as a leverage in their blackmailing tactics against the West, while not realizing that they themselves may become vicitms of their own game. Only joint Allied policies which are designed to defend the integrity of all of the nations in the Middle East and to uphold the basic principles of international law in conformity with the Charter of the. United Nations will protect the na- tional interests of our country. JUST A GOOD NATURED HUGI (Courtesy N. Y. Daily Mirror) Approved For Release 2006/12/01: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 NAZIS IN WONDERLAND On October 1, 1956, a black limousine roared out of the Spandau prison gate, careened left and sped away down a side street. Newsmen who endeavored to cover the event, were surrounded by scores of menacing armed guards. German police threw a road block of trucks across the street to prevent reporters from pursuing. The elaborate measures to assure the privacy and com- fort of Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz were executed with clockwork precision. The entire military-like operation must have impressed the Admiral who had been chosen by Hitler as his successor to lead Nazi Germany. Perhaps Doenitz recalled another day when his movements and those of his Nazi associates were closely guarded by the armed retainers of the Third Reich. Whatever went through his mind as he relaxed in his limousine, this much was reality: he was a free man after having served ten years for war crimes and crimes against the peace. Doenitz continued to avoid the searching questions of reporters after he had reached his destination in Dussel- dorf. \"My task,\" he said, \"is to remain silent and to feel my way back to life.\" In other times Docnitz did not show a reluctance to speak out forcefully and with con- viction. Thus, when he directed U-boat warfare resulting in the sinking of 15 million tons of World War II ship- ping, costing the lives of thousands of Allied personnel, he sharply commanded his officers to \"kill and keep killing. Remember, no survivors. Humanity is weakness. At Dusseldorf lie preferred silence. Yet, in other times, Docnitz spoke up with authority and confidence. On the day when he was chosen by Hitler as the new Fuchrer of the Thousand Year Reich, lie issued a declaration to the Nazi Wehrmacht: \"German armed forces, my comrades. The Fuehrer is dead. Faithful to his great idea to save the people of Europe from Bolshevism, he had devoted his life and has died the death of a hero. With him one of the greatest heroes of German history has gone. With proud respect and sorrow we lower the flags for him.\" It was precisely at this time when the Nazi regime was on the verge of collapse, that Docnitz together with General Keitel, hanged as a war criminal, initialed a top secret memorandum entitled \"The Overcoming of the Catastrophe.\" In this document Doenitz calls for a post- war tie-up with Bolshevist Russia. Such a collaboration, the Doenitz memorandum stated, would have the follow- ing perspectives: \"A colossal bloc of world-doininaling greatness, economic power, energy and numbers of popu- lation would be created from ocean to ocean. Not only would the danger of future tears for generations be elimi- nated from Europe but also from the double continent of Eurasia. The two great peoples, the Russians and the Germans, have extraordinary possibilities for development without collision of their interests. The chief emphasis in this bloc will shift more a,!d more to the ran-ally superior, intellectually more active, and more energetic (people), that means to Europe. Thus would be formed an alliance between the young Socialist forces against the old rotten entrenched powers of the West.\" Thus, Herr Doenitz who publicly posed as the new savior against Communism, secretly advocated an alliance with Soviet Russia at the expense of the West! Doenitz' crimes were thoroughly catalogued at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. He was described by the U. S. Prosecutor, the late justice Robert Jackson, as \"Hitler's legatee of defeat. He promoted the success of the Nazi aggressions by instructing his pack of submarine killers to conduct warfare at sea with the illegal ferocity of the jungle.\" Though Doenitz prefers the privacy of silence for the time being, his supporters- -and there are many-hail him as the legitimate chief of the German nation.* The Bonn Government has not dealt with this question but it has recognized Doenitz' claim for a pension. This pension will be granted to the Admiral, according to the Ministry of Finance, on the basis of his \"rank and length of service.\" If the Ministry of Finance regards service to Hitler as legitimate grounds for receiving an annual pen- sion that may run as high as $6,000, will the day come when his claim to speak for all of Germany will also be recognized; One week following Doenitz' release, the German Dc- fcnse Ministry announced that over 13,000 former officers in Hitler's Waffen SS had applied for posts in the new *Indeed, the Grand Admiral ree,nr to haze some enthusiastic ad- herents in the C.

The slowdown in economic expansion will continue and will be- come more noticeable as young men are drafted into the armed forces. German youth, already averse to military service and indulging in out- breaks of mild hooliganism, will tend ever more to took for political change. The next year will be remarkable for the fact that there is a campaign to unseat Dr. Adenauer but no clear plan to put anything in his place. There is an unhappy suspicion that there is not a new generation on the march but a new gang on the move.

The month before, the Defense Ministry announced that all members of this criminal organization would be welcomed back to the fold after \"screening.\" Several months prior to this declaration, the Defense Ministry stated that former Field Marshal Erich von Manstein had been given access to NATO military secrets. Von Manstein has been found guilty and imprisoned for war crimes committed in Italy during World War II. Now he was awarded an office in the German Defense Ministry and was asked by the Parliamentary Defense Committee of the Bundestag to serve as an advisor on the future organization of German armed forces. The release of Doenitz, the reactivation of the Waffen SS, and the appointment of von Manstein mark a signifi- cant stage in the setting up of the \"new\" Wehrmacht. These events are not disconnected. They are part of the pattern of things to come as the German General Staff develops plans for the future. It is therefore surprising that the German Defense Ministry refused to recommend for use in army libraries the book \"The Third Reich and the Jews\"?

Joachim Pelper, trigger- man of the 1944 Malmedy massacres. National Commander W. C. Daniel singled out Spencer Phenix, Chocorua, N .H., the American member of the board. In an open letter to families of the victims, Mr. Daniel said: \"I pledge to you-in what must be a moment of heartsick disgust and despair- that the American Legion will not rest until Spencer Phenix and all other government officials responsible for the release of the Malmedy murderers are removed from office and replaced by Americans who believe that the lives of your loved ones and of every American fighting man cannot be traded for a few years in jail.\" Peiper, with his boss, Col. Gen. Sepp Dietrich, first was sentenced to die for machine-gunning 160 disarmed Americans at Malmedy, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge. Dietrich's parole last year aroused a storm of protest. Peiper's release over the holidays ap- parently caught veterans' groups by sur- prise. In his letter, Mr. Daniel called Peiper's release \"the most sordid travesty on justice in the history of international law.\" One of the few Malmedy survivors, former It. Virgil P. Lary, Columbus, Ohio, last year warned that Peiper's release would \"dishonor\" the nation's war dead. \"The screams of my men . . . still ring in my ears,\" said Mr. Lary. (Jim G. Lucas, N. Y.

On the other hand, German book shops are doing profitable business on the sale of such books as W. V. Assenbach's book, \"Adolf Hitler: His Fight Against the Inferior Being.\" In the face of these sinister developments the Chancel- lories of the Western Democracies remained silent. Reply- ing to the Society's protest over the appointment of von Manstein, the State Department declared, \"These matters lie within the competence of the German Federal Re- public, which has been a sovereign governme'zt since May 5, 1955.\" But what about the responsibility which our State De- partment owes to the hundreds of thousands of GIs who gave their lives for the cause of freedom and human dig- nity? And what of the generations of youth to come? Will they, too, be called upon to make the supreme sacrifice because we allow \"these matters\" to lie \"within the com- petence\" of the West German Government?

S. and Allied forces in Germany after May 1956. This decision was made known through the German press before word of it was sent to the Allied authorities. Through this unusual diplomacy the Bonn Government was able to trigger a cam- paign of slander and incitation against her NATO partners. The Western Allies including the U. S. were accused of looting the German Treasury and employ- ing underhanded tactics at the expense of the well-being of the German people. This press barrage served as a prepara- tory assault for the official announcement that the Germans would refuse to pay for the support of the Allied forces. The Bonn Government based its posi- tion on the Contractual Agreement which made no provision for German financial support of the Allied forces subsequent to May 1956. Though the Germans stuck to the letter of this agreement, it was patently obvious that they had violated its spirit. The Contractual Agreement assumed that the Germans would cease financial support when they had sufficient armed forces of their own to take over the responsibilities which the Allies had shouldered for defending German soil. However, the German army was still in the blueprint stages in early 1950 and therefore the Allies were being asked to continue to protect West Germany with- out any costs to the Germans themselves. The Society called this crucial issue to the attention of the Congress of the United States. We declared that the Ger- man decision threatened to undermine the NATO defense system. We charged that Germany's refusal to make a contribution and the dishonest and insolent attacks levied against the Western Allies was \"not indicative of a government profess- ing friendship with the West.\" We also raised the question as to whether thiswas it maneuver on West Germany's part \"to force U. S. and Allied forces out of Ger- many with the view towards making a deal with the Russians on that basis.\" Unfortunately, the Western Allies beat it retreat before the Bonn Government's brazen challenge. They agreed to a 55 her cent slash in the funds which were originally requested from the Bonn Gov- ernment to support the Allied forces. As far as we know, the Allied authorities continue to accept the Bonn Govern- ment's professions of good faith. We, on the other hand, interpreted this epi- sode as but a prelude to further efforts by West Germany to go back on her pledges. Watering Down Conscription Our suspicions were justified for by September 1956 Chancellor Adcnauer an- nounced that the period of military serv- ice for German conscripts would be fixed at one year instead of eighteen months. This decision, too, was made public in an unusual way. The Information Oflicc of the German Federal Government is- sued a statement that Chancellor Ade- nauer had scrapped the eighteen months conscription plan when he had learned from American newspapers that Ameri- can forces in Europe would be reduced under the so-called Radford Plan. This alibi was so fantastic that even the Social Democrats who opposed the idea of con- scription described it as the \"most gro- tesque explanation any federal govern- ment ever made to the public\" (Chris(ian Science Monitor, 9-28-56). Diplomatic protocol was ignored by llerr Adenauer since the decision was made public through the German press before the Allies were officialy notified of it. Needless to say, the Western Allies were taken aback by Adenauer's blunt- ness. The decision was viewed by them as a gross violation of his pledges to supply necessary armed forces, as pro- vided in the agreements between West Germany and NATO. The NATO Coun- cil stated flatly that \"the NATO mili- tary authorities have made clear the diffi- culty, if not the impossibility, of accom- plishing this objective with a service period of only twelve months.\" In this connection it is noteworthy that all of the members of NATO with the excep- tion of tiny Luxembourg, have a much longer conscription service than that pro- posed by the Germai for themselves. The \"New\" Arnry However, this is only one aspect of the issue. It is now freely admitted by Allied military authorities that Bonn's decision will make inevitable the develop- ment of a professional army, the kind which always was the bulwark of Ger- man militarism. It is also of significance that together with the abolishment of the eighteen months plan for conscription Chancellor Adenauer approved the ad- mission of former members of Hitler's Waffen SS into the new German army. It is a matter of record that the Waffen SS was one of Hitler's most notorious organizations. Its crimes helped to turn Europe into a vast graveyard. For its bar- barous deeds it was condemned and out- lawed by the International Military Tri- bunal at Nuremberg. Yet, it is precisely these professional cutthroats who will \"be the backbone\" of the new German army (Christian Science Monitor, 9-28-56). As for the so-called Radford Plan, Adenauer admitted that he assumed its existence on the basis of reports in U. S. papers. The U. S. Government has offi- cially denied that there ever was such a plan, but Adenauer, in desperation to justify his unilateral action, endeavored to give the impression that the unauthen- ticated press reports were tantamount to the official policy of the U. S. Govern- ment. In the face of Allied reaction to his alibi, Adenauer was compelled to speak with more candor. Thus, he told his party leaders that his government was determined to make it clear to the NATO Council that West Germany had \"'overcommitted herself with regard to the number of troops\" (New York Times, 10-17-56). Np longer was Ade- nauer able to hide behind the alleged Radford Plan. Now he had to admit that Germany had its own ideas about con- tributing to NATO. Of course, candor is not one of the characteristics of West German diplomacy, and that is why many of our policy makers seem con- fused over Germany's attitude. When Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 German rearmament policy is guided by a number of considerations which are- masked by the plethora of platitudes which are found in Adenauer's speeches before Western audiences. Among these factors we cite the following: (1) Profitability: Today Germany is enjoying an unprecedented economic boom. In no small degree this is due to the fact that the Germans are able to apply virtually all of their resources and energies to peacetime production while a substantial portion of the resources of the Western Allies is tied up in armament production. The New York Times (1- 18-56) reported that the Ruhr barons find it more advantageous \"for West Germany to continue to expand its civilian economy and use its surpluses for the pur- chases of armaments abroad.\" The views of this group are shared by top govern- ment officials and members of the Ger- man Parliament who believe that West Germany should \"pay the barest mini- mum for armament compatible with its commitmerits to NATO.\" The Times notes that this position is based on the doctrine that armament \"must not inter- fere with the normal development of the civilian economy and if it does, it is not worth having.\" Some months ago the Minister of Finance Fritz Schaeffer delivered a speech in Bavaria in which he said that Germany was not anxious to build an armaments industry. He contended that it would be more profitable to purchase arms from abroad while \"the Ruhr remains the workshop of peaceful industries\" (Lon- don Financial Times, 8-27-56). In a moment of frankness Herr Schaeffer ad- mitted that the Western Allies might not take to the idea that they shall devote money and plant space \"for arms pro- duction while we (the Germans) utilize ours for export goods\" (Time Magazine, 9-10-56). While recognizing this difficulty Herr. Schaeffer and the leaders of the German economy insist that the rearmament pol- icy must be guided by the single standard of profit and loss. At times they will try to rationalize this position by the rather comical argument that Germany's most effective contribution to NATO would be to strengthen her peacetime economy and to widen her export markets. (2) An up-to-date Wehrmacht: After World War I German rearmament pro- ceeded at a slow pace because of the Versailles Treaty. Yet, Germany was able to turn the prohibitive clauses in the Versailles Treaty to her own advantage. While other countries were still employ- ing relatively obsolete weapons and shap- ing their strategy accordingly, the Ger- WHO IS FOOLING WHOM? Defense Minister Theodor Blank said West Germany would have 96,000 men under arms by the end of this year. He denied there was any lag in the armament program.... \"At the risk of being called a liar later, I can assure you that we shall carry out our NATO obligations this year to the fullest extent,\" Herr Blank told a group of visiting United States editors and commentators. The West German armament program calls for the creation of a twelve-division, 500,000- man armed force as the Bonn Government's contribution to the Western defense forces. (U. P., 3-27-56) A West German spokesman today said the goal of a 96,000-man army by the end of this year will have to be abandoned.... As a result, the new Defense Minister, Franz Josef Strauss, will have to inform the North Atlantic Treaty Organization council in Paris later this fall that \"certain delays\" have arisen. Mr. Strauss was named to succeed Theodor Blank yesterday in a move which suggests eventual abandonment of the goal of a 500,- 000-man \"citizen-soldier\" army. The former Minister for Atomic Affairs has favored a 300,000-man professional force armed with atomic weapons.... (Gaston Coblentz, N. Y. Her. Trib.) man General Staff was able to proceed with deliberation and without overcom- mitting itself until \"all of the returns were in.\" In short, Germany began to rearm in a big way only when the latest weapons of war were available. Many of these weapons had been created by other countries but Germany was in the posi- tion to exploit their possibilities to the fullest without going through the enor- mous expense of experimenting over a long period of time. This approach to rearmament was of decisive importance in producing the most modern war ma- chine under Hitler. After the defeat of Germany in World War II the decks were clean again. As in the past Germany had the opportunity to start afresh in developing the most modern weapons of war. This is the way the Germans have reconstructed im- portant branches of their economy. For example, some months ago Franz Josef Strauss, former Federal Minister for Atomic Questions, declared that West Germany was faced with the task of \"catching up with the progress. made by other nations during the last ten or fifteen years\" in the field of atomic energy. .. In reply to those in West Germany who voiced concern over West Ger- many's backwardness in atomic energy, Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Herr Strauss stated: \"We shall build on the experience of other nations and turn to research and training in the field of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. We shall not, however, construct large- scale atomic power stations, which by the time they are completed in five or six years will become unprofitable and out- moded because of technical progress. It is not a matter of doing something fast but of doing what is necessary in the right way\" (The Bulletin, 6-7-56). A similar line of thought has been ex- pressed by the leaders of the German aircraft industry. The steel industry, too, has boasted that the destruction of plants has enabled the industry to reconstruct on the most modern basis available. There is no doubt that this is the general position taken by German strate- gists in mapping Germany's plans for the future, Herr Strauss who has now been appointed Defense Minister, has made this crystal clear. According to the New York Times (9-23-56) Strauss warned \"against the hasty building up of an army that might become obso- lescent before it was fully formed,\" He was reported to have said that the army blueprinted five years ago for Germany \"might produce only a second rate army today.\" Consequently, he urged that the Bonn Government \"'go slow now\" so as to make sure that the new German army would be the most modern war machine possible. Time Magazine (9-10-56) in discussing Germany's reluctance to rearm as originally pledged, also referred to this factor: \"Weapons are in a transi- tional state and Germans do not want to commit themselves to large scale produc- tion until the weapons of the future have taken clear shape.\" The Chairman of the German Bunde- stag Defense Committee, Richard Jaeicr, criticized what lie alleged was the Allied attempt to load West Germany with out- dated arms. \"We do not want to pay for a false investment with the bones of German panzer (tank) troops,\" he said (New York Herald Tribune, 10- 3-56). To repeat, the Germans prefer that the Western Allies devote huge re- sources to the development of new weapons so that Germany can ultimately reap the rewards. (3) C'Jwejri0ns from i/ e U. S. A_- The Germans are Mill hoping that they can extract additional bounties from the U. S. Treasury as their price for rearming. Chancellor Adenaucr's Minister for Eco- nornic Affairs, Ludwig Erhard, assured the Bonn Parliament that defense ex- penditures would not exceed $2 billion annually. When he was asked what he would do if costs would be greater than this figure, Herr Erhard retorted, \"then let the Americans pay!\" (New York Times, 2-27-55). Finance Minister Schacf- fer has also expressed the same view. A New York Times dispatch (2-5-56) reported a statement by Schaeffer to the effect that \"West Germany could not meet its commitments to NATO unless the U. S. were to meet the deficit-\" From time to time Chancellor Adenauer has also expressed this view, namely, that the major cost for German rearmament must be underwritten by the American tax- payers. The New York Times (1-25-56) ported that the views of the German political leaders were shared by all im- portant groups in West Germany. Besides the notion that Uncle Sam must foot the bill for German rearmament, the Germans are beginning to sound out our Government on a program that would, in effect, subsidize Germany's export drive. Indeed, this is the very heart of the so-called \"Point 4;/z Program\" spon- sored by the Krupp interests. While pub- licizing this plan as a move to help under- developed countries, Krupp hopes to be able to secure a dominating position in these markets. The Point 41/2 Program is still in the preliminary stages of dis- cussion and it remains to be seen whether the United States will grease the way for the Krupp venture via the U. S. Treasury. Unquestionably the Germans will show more sympathy to \"rearmament\" when and if they can milk Uncle Sam for ad- ditional billions, (Sec No. 18, p. 19,) (i) lI\"ar Guilt and ll 'ar Crrntrrtalr: The Society has frequently pointed out that Germany's top leaders including Chancellor Adenaucr have resented the implications of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. They are bitter about the punishment meted out to those who deny that they were war criminals in spite of all of the evidence to the contrary, In the past German leaders and militarists have railed against the United States for keeping in prison those who were \"hon- orable\" soldiers and politicians. The Al- lies have been warned and threatened that :o long as one of these \"heroes\" remains in prison the German people will not show enthusiasm for military cooperation. At the rate that the Allies are freeing these criminals, one would expect that this factor would lose its importance. But one should not underestimate the other side of this question of war criminality, i,c,, the role of the Allies in World War 11. There are powerful voices in Germany today who say that the Allies must admit that they were in wrong when they op- posed Hitler who, after all, was only trying to save Europe from Bolshevism. If the past is any guide to the future, then we can anticipate that in due time \"public opinion\" in Germany will de- mand that the Allies must admit their \"guilt\" before the Germans will whole- heartedly cooperate with the Allied powers, (5) A Gerrrran-Soviet Deal: Of deci- sive importance in West Germany's cal- culations with regard to rearmament are her relations with the Soviet Union. There are many important leaders and groups who insist that West Germany go slow on rearmament for the sake of cementing her relations with the Russians. This position is held by two of Ger- many's most important parties, the Social Democrats and the Free Democratic Party. It is a view that is shared widely in West Germany, This is confirmed by the Christian Science Monitor's well-known correspondent in Germany, J. Emlyn Wil- liams, who reported, \"Most West Ger- mans see remilitarization tied too closely to the Western powers as a hindrance (to German unification) because of Soviet objections\" (9-21-56). To the German military no less than to the big industrialists of the Ruhr whose mouths water when they think of the markets in the East, and to the growing number of politicians, the idea of a Russo-German deal is a worthwhile goal. If they could prove to the Russians that their military cooperation with the West is of a pro forma character, then the way Could be paved for an under- standing. This vision of an embrace with the Russians unquestionably enters into the disarmament picture. (6) German Acsels: From Chancellor Adenauer down, the Germans have been working overtime to regain the assets of 1. G. Farben which were vested by the U. S. Government. Adenauer ]-,as publicly declared that the return of there assets was of the greatest importance in strengthening friendship between the U. S. and West Germany. On March 8, 1954, he said, \"Any just solution of this question will strengthen the confidence Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 of the German people in the principles of the free world, will make fast the friendship between the American and German peoples and will relieve the Ger- man Government of a great worry.\" The Suddeutsche Zeitung (3-6-55) was more to the point about the \"great worry\" when it asked why German property should not be returned since the Germans and the United States have undertaken \"military pledges of alliance to one an- other ...\" A more blunt comment on the rela- tionship between the return of the assets and Germany's military cooperation with NATO was made by Der Tag (3-5-55) when it stated, \"The situation is more serious here in Germany than people in America realize. If Mr. Abs (Hitler's paymaster and leading German banker) does not win a satisfactory solution (for the return of the Farben interests) on his trip to Washington, General Gruen- ther loses a battle.\" To our knowledge, no paper in the United States reported this interesting comment. The voice of Farben, just as under Hitler, has special influence on Bonn policy and Herr Ade- nauer wil hardly move quickly to fulfill his pledges to NATO so long as Farben is not paid off. \"Anti-Militarism\" In assessing West Germany's attitude toward rearming at the present time one cannot ignore the factors mentioned above. Unfortunately, most commentators have evaluated the general slowdown in German rearmament as an indication of the growing anti-militaristic spirit in Germany. We do not deny the fact that there are many people in West Germany, particularly among the youth, who have no enthusiasm for a new German Wchr- macht. We do not even doubt their sin- cerity and we are even willing to concede for argument's sake that they are in the majority. However, a similar situation oc- curred after World War I. Then as now, most Germans were caught in the wave of disillusionment and embittcr!_-ent to- ward the futility of war and militarism. This general feeling was symbolized by the great novel \"All Quiet on the West- ern Front\" by Erich Maria Remarque. Yet, there was a radical change of feeling at the beginning of the 1930s and those who shouted \"nie wieder\" in the 1920s began to echo the cries of the Nazis for revenge and for regaining tie glories of the Fatherland. As for today, we say that all encour- agement should be given to these anti- militaristic sentiments but-let us not con- fuse the immediate mood with the long- range factors and plans that are operat- ing on the German scene. Even Krupp has publicly declared his disgust with war, but who would dare to say that Krupp has turned pacifist? The confusion on the so-called anti-militaristic spirit in Germany became even more pronounced when Adenauer fired Herr Blank and appointed Franz-Josef Strauss to the de- fense post. The New York Post writer, Theodore Kaghan, who is thoroughly fa- miliar with the German problem, hailed the Strauss appointment as \"a concession to the rising resentment toward rearma- ment throughout the country ...\" (New York Post (10-18-56). If it were only true ! The New Defense Minister Who is Herr Strauss? According to published records Strauss is a Bavarian who, in his youth, distributed Nazi propaganda in Munich, the birthplace of 1Iitlerism (Time Magazine, 10-29-56), and during World War .II served in Hitler's Wehrmacht as an artillery lieu- tenant. According to the Christian Science Monitor Herr Strauss \"inclines much more toward the old military tradition\" (10-16-56). In our lexicon this can only mean that he its an admirer of \"the good old days\" when the German General Staff reigned supreme. Thus, Time Magazine reports that Strauss is determined to reestablish \"a military planning group, tantamount to a German Geenral Staff.\" Strauss has insisted that the German army must be equipped \"with the most modern weapons available in- cluding atomic arms ...\" (New York Times, 10-18-56). Parenthetically, it should be noted that when Strauss visited the United States in the spring of 1956, he gave public: assurances that Germany would strictly adhere to her pledges that the Germans would not employ the atom in her military setup (Washington Post, 5-17-56). Time Magazine (.l. c.) re- ports that Strauss demands. \"a national German army of professional soldiers.\" Moreover, he insists that the new German army must \"be as independent as pos- sible, because he felt that the NATO strategy was not in Germany's best in- ;crests.\" In. the face of these facts it is difficult to agree with the interpretation that Strauss' appointment represents a victcry for anti-militarism. It is true that Strauss' army will not be large quantitatively. However, if it is organized along the lines envisaged by him, equipped with atomic weapons, its quality will make up for the shortage of numbers. The profes- sional character of this army is indicated by the fact that it will be dominated by career soldiers, one out of every three being an officer or a Lion-commissioned officer. The Atom Strauss' insistence on putting ato_ s bombs in the hands of his professional army has been fully endorsed by Ade- nauer. The story goes that, when Ade- nauer visited Belgium in September 1956 he asked the Western statesmen to support his request that Germany be equipped with atomic bombs. Adenauer's position \"startled Belgium's Paul Henri Spaak\" (Time Magazine, 10-8-56). Certainly these plans of Adenauer and Strauss can hardly be regarded as further- ing the cause of anti-militarism. Yet, the German bigwigs are pleased that there is an anti-militaristic feeling in Germany for this sentiment serves a twofold pur- pose: (1) to delay rearmanent on the basis of the factores outlined above, (2) to carefully plan the new German army so that it will be even mightier than that which fought for Hitler. Therefore, while we are pleased to see that there is a wave of anti-militarism in Germany and believe it should be sup- ported, we must beware of the fickleness of German sentiment as we must beware of the Krupps, the Kesselrings and the Doenitzes. Some of our readers have interpreted our strictures against West Germany's failure to abide by her armament com- mitments as an indication that the Society favors German rearmament. Nothing can be further from the truth. As in the past we remain unalterably opposed to the remililarization of West Germany and East Germany since we believe that the rearming of the former enemy will turn out , to be a long step toward World War III. By exposing Germany's failures in meeting her NATO commitments we have tried to re-emphasize the fact that Germany's pledges to the Allies are not worth the paper they are written on, be it in military or other matters.

HUMPHREY 'is from a!t address by Senator Humphrey al the Overseas Preis Club in New York Cily) We are almost at the end of the most momentous year since World War IT. It has been a paradoxical year-one in which both the United States and the Soviet Union have suffered severe diplomatic defeats. The United States saw the North Atlantic alliance shaken to its roots when war broke out in the Middle East. And the Soviet Union lost its grip on the captive countries of Eastern Europe. It is too soon to attempt to strike a balance as to who lost more. It is not too soon, however--indeed, we have waited too long already-to begin an urgent reappraisal, however agonizing it may be, of the world situation and of our own posture toward it. Quite obviously, fundamental changes of enormous con- sequence have taken place. No man can foresee where they will end. The old, static condition has ended; conditions are more fluid than at any time since 19-15. The cold war has changed from one of fixed positions to one of maneuver. This increases somewhat the dangers; but it also greatly in- creases the opportunities for statesmanship that is both wise and bold, imaginative and judicious. Our first task is to assess the nature and implications of these changes that are taking place. The first thing we must realize is that in today's world there can be no effective foreign policy without risks. There is no risk-proof insurance policy that will guarantee freedom and security in today's world. One of the basic facts of our time is the spirit of national- ism which dominates the thinking of most of the underde- veloped areas of the world. We are ill familiar with the manifestations of this force-the anti-Westernism throughout much of Asia and Africa and the irresponsible fashion in which the Soviet Union has tried to take advantage of this feeling and use it for its own ends. What we are now seeing is the re-emergence of this same spirit of nationalism in the Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Nationalism is challenging international communism on its home grounds, and the end is not yet. This point, up, as clearly as anything possibly could, the truth of what many Americans have been saying for years-- namely, that inter- national communism is fundamentally inconsistent with na- tionalism and that it presents the most serious threat of all to the hard-won independence of the new states of Asia and Africa.. . . One reason we need the U. N. is to provide a constructive focus for this tremendous force of nationalism which other- wise would be running wild. The U. N. does not control nationalism, but it does provide a framework in whuh na- tionalism can find its proper and responsible place in a world society that is becoming increasingly interdependent. The U. N. can likewise protect and encourage nationalism. The problems we now face in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have little in common, but it can be said, I think, that the roots of the problems in both instances are nationalist in origin. The challenge, both before the U. N. and before our own government, is how we deal with these problems in a responsible manner calculated to promote the principles of the United Nations Charter, to ad- vance the national interests of the United States, and to bring some greater measure of peace and freedom to the people of the areas concerned.. . . The ferment in Eastern Europe obviously presents oppor- tunities; but it also places a great obligation on us to act in a sober, responsible manner. We should he prepared to discuss sympathetically economic aid with the independent governments of Eastern Europe, as, for example, Poland. . . . Much can be done through other policies if we but have the wit to think of them. And we had better think of some pretty fast, because the manifestations of nationalism in East- ern Europe increase the urgency of finding some sort of se- curity system that Europe can live with. In some respects, the ohs ious weaknesses of communism in the captive countries may well give the Soviets pause. But in other respects, this situation could trigger World War Ili-either as a Soviet tactic to re-establish control or as a consequence of some as yet more violent explosion in one of the satellites.... - We should continue, of course, to use every avenue avail- able to put increasing pressure on the Soviets through the United Nations in regard to the Hungarian situation. By their arrogant defiance of the UN, they are increasingly iso- lating themselves from the rest of humanity. The UN actions in regard to Hungary have not been as vigorous as I would have liked and the situation has dragged on longer than I would have liked, but by proceeding one step at a time we have been able to resolve some of the doubts that troubled many of the Asian-African states at the beginning. It is my personal view, however, that the UN should go further in regard to Hungary. In commenting upon the UN action in regard to the Middle East, Vice President Nixon recently said that it upheld the rule of law--'the same law for the powerful and the strong as for the weak and the defenseless.\" What the UN must now do in regard to I iun- gary is to apply the same law to the scoundrels and aggressors as to the decent and honorable. .. . Certainly the UN cannot content itself with condemna- tory resolutions, no matter how strongly worded. We should not only take steps to insure against the return of the spurious Hungarian representatives who walked out of the UN last week; we should also give consideration to economic and Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 diplomatic sanctions against the Kadar regime in Hungary and against the Soviet Union itself. As of now, the Soviet Union and her puppet regime in Budapest have refused to let U. N. observers come into Hungary. We must continue to press hard to demand that these observers be admitted. Even without observers, the world has learned several things from these recent horrors in Hungary. First, these uprisings show that there still exists in satellite lands the same love of freedom which is the natural heritage of man everywhere. Second, we have learned how totally unrealistic it is to as- sume that the people of the satellite countries will automat- ically support Moscow. That is a very important lesson. . Third, we have learned that you. cannot easily crunch the spirit of liberty. It keeps glowing in spite of years of totali- tarian repression and in spite of foreign armies. Fourth, we have learned that even the youth brought up during such periods of repression still desire liberty and are willing to fight for it. . . . We have also learned that food is tremendously important as a weapon-both in a cold and in a hot war, and this has become something of a hot war. Our policy with regard to food assistance has not been clear. It is disgraceful that we should receive dispatches about food shortages, even in Austria, when we have adequate sup- plies, including supplies of milk, that we could easily have sent. We should dramatize the airlift which we're using to bring in refugees, by sending-every plane back on the return trip loaded to capacity with powdered milk and other food supplies, so that our response could be immediately seen and our aid would be dramatic, .and inspiring to those who are fighting for freedom. We should also extend the use of American food to any country that takes refugees and needs such aid, besides Austria. . . Revelation of the Soviet oppression in Hungary has had the most damaging effect on the Communist party of anything since the Stalin-Hitler pact of 1939. It has increased the chances of the breakdown of the Soviet empire and has con- tributed to the unrest of students and intellectuals in Russia itself. Now is the time when America should speak not only in terms of good-will, but in terms of definite actions--ac- tions which may involve risks, but as I said before, there is no risk-proof insurance policy covering such things as freedom and security. Turning now to the Middle East, we find an area where the problems are so many and so complex that one hardly knows where to start. It is now truly a power vacuum. Al- though Soviet influence has greatly increased, American pres- tige is also at a new high. As the Soviet threat makes solutions to the area's problems more urgent, so does the new American position, coupled with the new solidarity which has developed in the UN, offer hope of finding solutions. The UN has an especially important role to play. It is dangerous for either the United States or the Soviet Union to try to be the dominant power in the Middle East; this is an area ready-made for the kind of, international ministrations that the UN is peculiarly equipped to undertake. As Germany is the key in Europe, so 'I think the Arab- Israeli conflict is the key in the Middle East. It is idle to expect peace ever to come to that unhappy area until some settlement of this conflict is reached. It has been amply demonstrated that the UN will not tolerate aggression in the Middle East. It is also, I think be- coming increasingly clear to the states of that area that it is not in their own interests to rely on the Soviet Union. What we must now do is to make it still more clear to the Arabs and Israelis alike that it is in their own interests to reach a settlement, that they hurt themselves more than anyone else by stubbornly insisting that the world has not moved since 1947. In the last analysis, this dispute can be settled only by the parties concerned, and we cannot expect them to do that until they realize that they will be better off with it settled than with it unsettled. The United States and also the United Nations must be firm and just with both sides. As we acted to halt the invasion of Egypt, so we should now take steps to halt persecutions of Jews in Egypt. We can certainly not stand idly by in the face of increasing reports of anti-Semitism as an official policy of the Nasser government. In the best of circumstances, it will take at least a genera- tion for the hatreds of the Middle East to entirely abate. The more each side retaliates against the other, the longer it will take. It is unrealistic to expect an Arab-Israeli settlement to spring fullblown from any single set of negotiations. A settle- ment in the Middle East must be pursued one step at a time. The first step is obviously to bring about a complete with- Approved For Release 2006/12/01 CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 drawal of foreign forces from the area, in prompt compliance with U. N. resolutions. The second step is a settlement of the Suez Canal problem over and above the physical work of clearance. Here the six principles unanimously agreed to by the UN Security Council offer a good starting point for reaching an agreement on the Canal's operation. With these immediate issues out of the way and with a groundwork of quiet, careful diplomatic preparation, we can approach negotiations for a general settlement. There arc other things, however, that we can also be doing in the mean- time. What the Middle East desperately needs is economic development-not simply for its own sake but as a construc- tive endeavor to occupy the minds and energies of the people and their leaders. We have furnished a considerable amount of economic and technical assistance to the area; yet, with a few exceptions, it has not been particularly effective. We have tried very hard, and have failed, to get agreements on regional projects, such as the Jordan River plan. The time may now be more propitious for such undertak- ings, and we should vigorously renew our efforts, not only to get the Jordan River and similar projects underway but also to get some action on the refugee problem. It might be useful, in this connection, to consider estab- lishing, under United Nations auspices, a Middle East De- velopment Authority. Most of the economic, as well as the other, problems of the area are international in their scope. Most of them also require outside assistance, either in the form of capital, of technical aid, or of good ollires. Why not, then, have an international agency to deal with them? The kind of Middle East Development Authority that I have in mind would have, on its hoard of directors, representatives of all the states of the area as well as representatives of the states furnishing capital and technical assistance. Ample pro- vision could be made to protect national sovereignties. In any event, it appears obvious that we are going to have to extend more aid to the Middle East-and do it more effectively. Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of the whole Suez affair is that innocent bystanders, both in Europe and in the Middle East, are getting hurt. All of Western Europe is suffering from oil shortages along with Britain and France, though none of the other countries in Western Europe can be charged with any responsibility for their present troubles. And in the Middle East, the oil-producing states are suffering from lack of markets, though two of the states-- Iraq and Iran-had nothing to do with the events which brought this situation about. . . . To sum up: In the Middle East we must insist that the Canal be opened and cleared. We must insist upon the use of British and French and any other available equipment in helping achieve a purpose that is vital to all of us. We must keep U. N. forces in the Middle East large enough to cope with any danger in the area, and as long as is necessary, until a permanent settlement has been worked out. That settlement must be one which opens the Suez Canal and guarantees that it will remain open, free and unfettered, for the safe conduct of the shipping of all the world, includ- ing Israeli ships. The question of national ownership is sec- ondary--but the cllectiveness and enforcibility of these guar- antees must be absolute. In the end, an Arab-Israeli settlement must be brought about in Palestine. While the Arabs refuse to recognize the existence of Israel such a settlement is impossible. We must use every device available to American diplomacy, operating through the United Nations and otherwise, to overcome this intransigence, to make it clear that we expect to see a settle- ment reached, and that we insist upon an ending of the interminable border raids from either direction. Meanwhile we must move forward with it bold regional plan for eco- nomic aid, such as I have already outlined. Political factors must not be allowed to prevent settlement of the refugee problem. Wherever these refugees came from --and there are Jewish refugees from Arab countries as well as Arab refugees from Palestine--they are all of them people, and our first concern must he to get these human beings settled and re-integrated as part of the permanent economy of an area in the world that is easily able to support them, given some sensible economic plan and reasonable assistance. Now to conclude, the year 1957, which is almost upon us, is likely to be even more crucial than 1956. We have got to be both steadfast in principle and flexible in tactics. Today I have had time only to scratch the surface of some of the problems we face. I have raised more questions than I have answered. I think we can find the answers, but it will take more imagination and courage, fewer platitudes and less blinking at facts, than we have shown heretofore. People who have experienced the rise and fall of Hitler and the growth of the Muscovite Empire, know that in President Nasser's Cairo, Soviet and Nazi technicians are once more cooperating with all the intimacy inspired by their dead leaders' 1939 pact. Hence few men and women of the Old World can grasp the Administration's masochistic solicitude for Egypt's ruler. Nor can they understand the heartlessness with which Washington has been trying to use oil-hungry Europe's dire need as a means of diplomatic pressure, and showing not the slightest concern for NATO members who have been hurt at least as hard as the so-called \"aggressors\" in London and Paris. Mr. Dulles, or his successor, will somehow have to restore an Allied unity that, cordial words notwithstanding, U. S. deeds have denied. If the Secretary of State has succeeded in tem- porarily buying the friendship of Messrs. Nasser, Nehru, Sokarno and Tito-rulers of nations that lack the rudiments of democracy-his job now is to regain friends who are far more essential to the U. S. and whom he has insulted, humili- ated and harmed economically.

The future of the Middle East cannot be left to leisurely diplomatic maneuver in and out of the United Nations. It is now a matter of extreme urgency what that future is to be, because the survival of the free world hinges upon it. What is required at present is an objective reappraisal of the current economic and political forces at work in the Arab world and a determined effort to deal with them courageously. Although some perennial optimists in the State Department try to gloss over the fact, it is absolutely correct to say that Gamal Abdel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal on July 26 marked a crucial turning point, not only in relations between East and West, but also among the partners of the Western Alliance. Perhaps, as Britain's Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd. put it with diplomatic tact, the rift between the U. S. and its British and French allies has as yet. \"developed no irreparable damage.\" The tragic fact, however, remains that while the Western alliance is fraying apart, Soviet Russia is becoming the domi- nant power in Egypt, Syria, Jordon, and other parts of the Arab world. Lenin, Stalin, and their uneasy successors in the Kremlin were never able to achieve this on their own, through revolutionary intrigue, cold war strategy, or the smiling face of \"peaceful coexistence.\" The Egyptian dictator has accom- plished it for them through his policy aimed at the destruction of Israel and his seizure of the Canal. At the most critical juncture in the development of the Middle East in modern times, Washington has found itself with no policy at all, or rather a \"policy\" based on wishful thinking about and complete ignorance of Soviet intentions in the Middle East. The Washington experts were so used to viewing world events from their own end of the spectrum that they completely failed to grasp the fact that in Nasser's wake Soviet penetration of the Middle East was increasing by leaps and bounds. Washington hoped as usual to muddle through by ignor- ing the storm signals and refusing to see the Soviet menace. The State Department still naively believed that economic and technical assistance, increasingly resented by xenophobic Arab governments, accompanied by pious sermons about the virtues of democracy, would win corrupt and reactionary Arab politicians to our side and dispel the lure of demagogic Communism for disgruntled Arab intellectuals in search of a place in the sun. While the U. S. was offering technical aid and Point Four loans, the Kremlin oligarchs, working through Nasser and his imitators in Syria and Jordan, tightened their strangle- hold on the Middle East by lavish supplies of heavy arms. While we were offering them bread, the Soviet Union was presenting them with a sword and inflaming them with dreams of a Pan-Arab empire. The present situation in the Middle East cannot be realis- tically appraised without some knowledge of Russia's past and present aims in the Middle East. Russian policy-makers, Tsarist or Communist, have long been convinced that the road to world domination runs through the Middle East into the heart of Asia. Once the Middle East and the rest of Southern Asia had been brought under Russian control, they reasoned, Europe would surely follow; Historical parallels are sometimes misleading, but there is a strikingly similarity between present-day Soviet policy and the aims that shaped Tsarist policy in the Middle East during the 19th and early \" If I dropped my fig leaves-I could reach for my gun-if only I wanted to drop my fig leaves.\" Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 Approved For Release 2006/12/01 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480012-6 20th centuries. In 1900, Tsarist General Kuropatkin described Russia's long-range plans in the Middle East as follows: \"When we gain control over the Bosporus (Turkey) and the entrance to the Mediterranean, we shall be able to tackle the Egyptian question with energy and snake the Suez Canal our thoroughfare. When we have won this entry into the Indian Ocean, we can constantly threaten India. Russian com- petition on the world market will intimidate the highly de- veloped countries of Europe and America and we shall extend our tentacles towards the Atlantic.- Kuropatkin's ambitions were eclfaed by the Tsarist politi- cian, Skobelev, who declared: \"The stronger Russia is in the Middle East, the weaker England becomes in Asia and the more conciliatory she will be in Europe.- Contemporary Soviet interests match those of the Tsars. Forty years after Kuropatkin's blueprint for world conquest, Stalin and Molotov, in secret negotiations with Hitler in November 1940, made it clear that Soviet \"territorial aspira- tions center in the direction of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.\" Moscow's current policy in the Middle East presents an amalgam of \"new\" revolutionary slogans and tactics combined with century-old aims. At the beginning of this century, Russian ambitions in the Middle East were held in check by the rivalry of Germany, Austro-Hungary, France, Italy, and Britain. However, at the conclusion of the second World War, Britain remained vir- tually alone as guardian of Western strategic and economic interests in the area and the sole bulwark of military power against Soviet incroachment. One of the basic assumptions of U. S. foreign policy--insofar as we had a cicarcut foreign policy-was the preservation of British power in the Middle East. We have now, through our cooperation on the Suez Canal question at the United Nations with Moscow and its Euro- pean and Arab satellites, inflicted possibly irreparable dam- age on Britain's position, not only in the Middle East but in the world at large. With Britain no longer of military and political significance in the Middle East, and the United States maintaining, at least for the present, a policy of benevolent neutrality, the region has become a vacuum, irresistibly at- tractive to Soviet power, the influence of which is already felt. Partisans of current Washington policies contend that the U. S. refusal to support Britain, France and Israel will disarm Communism's ideological weapons and weaken Soviet influ- ence among the hungry and disease-ridden Arab masses. They ignore the fact that it was U. S. indecision and failure to take seriously Nasser's plans to wipe out Israel and the necessity of preserving the international character of the Suez water- way that brought about the rift in the Western alliance, and prompted Britain, France, and Israel to undertake military action against Egypt. Until the crisis in the Middle East is resolved, one thing remains abundantly clear: the East-West conflict continues, the cold war is renewed, and the threat of Soviet domination of the free world is still a burning issue. This conflict cannot be ended by the temporary palliative of a UN police force, but only through the maintenance of the political unity and military preparedness of the Western alliance and by unstint- ing support-military, economic, and diplomatic-for the State of Israel. Moscow is fully aware-even if the State Department is unconvinced-that today Israel is the main bastion of the free world in the Middle East and the sole barrier to Soviet domination of Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and probably of oil-rich Saudi Arabia. It is just because of this that the Soviet Union continues its vicious and unbridled attacks against Israel's right to exist. BUNDLES FOR GERMANY? I read with some dismay of the efforts of the Germans, with the apparent sympathy of the United States Administration, to recover some, if not all, of the German property seized in the United States. By the Paris Act of 1946, the Allies undertook not to return the German property they seized. By the Bonn Convention the validity of the seizure was recognized by the West German Federal Republic, which undertook to compen- sate its nationals accordingly. It is hard to understand why the United States should apparently be willing by a unilateral act to disregard such treaty obligations. Moreover, what will be the effect on our Euro- pean Allies? .. . The Germans occupied these countries and subjected them to economic pillage and, as you reported in an earlier issue, the claims of Holland for the restitution of securities looted during the occupation are as yet denied by the Germans....

The great danger is not that re- cruits are being rigidly trained again. It lies elsewhere: At one of the new airforce training schools an instructor officer delivered a so-called lecture on civics before the future young pilots. The topic of the talk: \"The Lost Homeland between Vistula and Memel.\" An officer of the Bundeswehr with the rank of battalion commander recently remarked to' a civilian visitor: \"Your apprehensions are all good and well but for me only one fact exists: the Russians have killed my father- I will never forget that.\" Approximately 50 percent of the Bundeswehr officer corps originally come from East Germany. Of course, they do not talk all day about what was taken from them; but the concept of the lost homeland has already become part of the official schedule. The slogan \"national injustice\" is making the rounds amongst the troops. Intentionally or not, officers stir up resentments; knowingly or unknowingly, they do awaken thoughts of revenge. And therein lies the danger. This danger is especially great because this time it does not apply to Alsace-Lorraine, Danzig and the Polish Corridor; rather, it concerns itself with half of Germany, with the \"lost homeland\" east of the Elbe and, because not only displaced persons but nearly every one of us is close to someone or something behind the iron curtain, even if it be a mother's grave. Though the attempt to liberate it is senseless, it is a holy cause. He who opposes it, is automatically branded. The danger is great for, after all, there is a difference if the civilian Karl Schulze from. Koenigsberg and his dear little spouse are still raving about beautiful East Prussia or if the Major of the Bundeswehr Karl Schulze indoctrinates his men with the thesis of the \"lost homeland\" and the \"injustice wreaked upon us.\" The danger here is especially great because the thesis does hold some truth and because the men who are indoctrinated are just learning how and for what purposes arms are to be used. Hardly do we have soldiers, and already we have again something for which-and against which-they could march. \"Start marching to any place? Out of the question. That is technically impossible,\" say authoritative Bundeswehr strate- gists. The objection betrays in which direction the military think. It is correct-that within this limitation for the present it is technically still impossible for us \"to march.\" The Bundeswehr is still in its infancy, American and (a few) British soldiers are still stationed in West Germany and Soviet soldiers in East Germany. Some day, however, the Bundeswehr will stand in force, perhaps even-as per the Chancellor's order-in strenth of 500,000 men; some day, the last companies of Americans here and Russians there will have left. It is un- likely that the West German officers who today speak already of the \"lost homeland\" and the \"inability to ever forgetting\" will then become more reticent. Whether the politicians will then be able to, or even want to, check the military is a question which, in view of some of our present political personalities, cannot readily be answered in the affirmative. The people will not exactly rejoice if matters ever become earnest. But, rejoicing or not, as usual they will not be con- sulted but will just be called to the colors. Not all the regi- ments are in possession of their flags as yet but already the commandants and instructors are busily engaged in embroider- ing the battle cries upon them. These are age-old battle cries, but they retain their appeal and will ever continue to do so. The most telling slogan will again be the \"the fight against the injustice done to us and our people.\" This is enough to touch off warlike impulses even in the most pacifist German. Of course: it has not come to this yet. But, \"the future has started already.\" To express it in military terms, danger is in the offing.

The official reason given for their expul- sion was that they had attempted to interview Egypt's ex- President Naguib who is held incommunicado under house arrest. But, in fact, they were ousted from Egypt for another reason, for having attempted-and succeeded --in interview- ing almost as inaccessible, if free and even privileged, a personage, Professor Johann van Leers, a former top Nazi propagandist, who was and is probably still masterminding Egypt's anti-Jewish and anti-Israel propaganda campaign as head of a corps of Nazis reputedly numbering 200 in the service of President Nasser. Professor von Leers was first smoked out by Ann Sharpley. She walked into his oflice and addressed him by name and then refused to swallow his attempts to conceal his identity. She confronted him with irrefutable facts and data about his past. When he realized that further denials about his identity were futile, the professor sought to dismiss his importance by asserting that his function was limited to translating for President Nasser articles in the world papers hostile to Egypt or the president himseif. What is the background of this shadowy figure who acts as adviser to Egypt's Minister of National Guidance and who occupies with his staff an entire floor in that ministry? Re- cently a Dutch newspaper Trouut published an incident in which Professor von Leers figured and which of itself is revelatory. The story goes back to 1933. In that year, according to the newspaper, an attempt was made to revive the Interna- tional Students' Organization by bringing together students from Germany, Britain, and France in order to influence them to help maintain peace in the world. The Dutch university city of Leyden was chosen as the meeting place. The Dutch delegation, acting as host, participated in the mainly Anglo- Franco-German students' conference. Since the efforts of Britain, France and I Tolland were directed at influencing the German students to help maintain peace, the German delegation was naturally the focal point of attention. Its president became therefore the central figure of the conference. His arrival was deliberately shrouded in mystery by the Germans; his name was not disclosed until he appeared; and he arrived only after all the other members of the conference had already gathered in Holland. Ito turned out to be a jovial and affable young man with several uni- versity degrees attached to his name. The name was: Dr. Johann von Leers. The conference proceeded fairly smoothly for several days, But then Dr. Huizinga, the Rector of Leyden University, urgently summoned the chairman of the Dutch delegation and requested him to find out whether the Dr. von Leers presiding over the German delegation was the author of a recently published virulent anti-Semitic pamphlet. It was titled Die Juden Sehen Dich An (Jews Are Looking at You). Among the many slanders contained in the pamphlet was the ritual murder libel, presented as an established fact. Young Dr. von Leers was summoned and questioned by the Dutch hosts. He readily admitted that he was the author of the pamphlet. When asked whether he himself believed in the ritual murder accusation, he fidgeted and laughed ner- vously, \"You see, that was written more than a year ago. It was before the general elections. The National Socialist party wanted something with a catchy slogan, something to get hold of the masses.... So they asked me to write a booklet with a strongly anti-Semitic angle. But really, between our- selves, there is no need to take it so seriously.\" But the Dutch professors, not easily put off, insisted that he state whether or not he believed in what he had written. After this preliminary interview, von Leers was requested to appear next morning before the University Senate which was obviously determined to inquire into his views and activities. Dr. von Leers tried to avoid the issue, going off on a tangent and attempting to involve his interrogators in a lengthy argu- HAILING HITLER Bashir al-Auf, the editor of a leading Syrian daily, Al Manor, wrote recently: \"One should not forget that, in contrast to Europe, Hitler occupied an honored place in the Arab world.

English and French journalists are mistaken if they think that by calling Nasser Hitler they are hurting us. On the contrary, his name makes us proud.

But they pressed him hard for an unequivocal yes or no, and finally he admitted that he did not believe in what he wrote. \"No, of course not,\" he mumbled. As soon as they heard this admission, the Dutch professors asked him point-blank whether he was prepared to correct his error publicly and in writing. He replied that it would be impossible since this would mean the end of his scientific career, and of his career altogether. On hearing this, Dr. Huizinga pointed to the door and exclaimed: \"Out with you ! such an individual does not deserve to breathe the air of Leyden!\" (This was not forgotten. Dr. Huizinga became one of the first hostages immediately after the establishment of the Nazi regime in Holland.) Johann von Leers, who is now 54 years old, was in his youth a member of the Freikorps Viking, one of the pre- cursors of the Nazi movement. He grew with the movement and with the party and, as early as 1929, he was an official of the German Foreign Office and a member of the Nazi party. In 1932 he joined the S.A. Brownshirts and in 1936 became a member of the German General Staff with the rank of major. He became an important figure in the racial research department, headed the department of foreign policy in the Nazi Political College, and was the chief editor of the Nazi journal Wille und Weg (The Will and the Way) published by the German propaganda Ministry. But in 1941 his star dimmed. He fell afoul of his chief, Alfred Rosenberg, the ideologist of the Nazi Party, and was sent in disgrace to Vienna, to fill the place of a professor who had been murdered by the Nazis. There he fell deeper into disgrace and. was charged with plagiarism and tried by a court of teachers.
