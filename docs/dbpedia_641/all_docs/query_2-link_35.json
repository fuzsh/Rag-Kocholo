To date, there is no pharmacological therapy to treat this disease or at least to alleviate cocaine craving as a core symptom. In animal models, impaired prefrontal-striatal signalling leading to altered glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens appear to be the prerequisite for cocaine-seeking. Thus, those network and metabolic changes may constitute the underlying mechanisms for cocaine craving and provide a potential treatment target. In humans, there is recent evidence for corresponding glutamatergic alterations in the nucleus accumbens, however, the underlying network disturbances that lead to this glutamate imbalance remain unknown. In this state-dependent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over multimodal study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in combination with small-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (voxel size: 9.4 × 18.8 × 8.4 mm3) was applied to assess network-level and associated neurometabolic changes during a non-craving and a craving state, induced by a custom-made cocaine-cue film, in 18 individuals with cocaine use disorder and 23 healthy individuals. Additionally, we assessed the potential impact of a short-term challenge of N-acetylcysteine, known to normalize disturbed glutamate homeostasis and to thereby reduce cocaine-seeking in animal models of addiction, compared to a placebo. We found increased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the cue-induced craving state. However, those changes were not linked to alterations in accumbal glutamate levels. Whereas we additionally found increased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and a midline part of the thalamus during the cue-induced craving state. Furthermore, obsessive thinking about cocaine and the actual intensity of cocaine use were predictive of cue-induced functional connectivity changes between the nucleus accumbens and the thalamus. Finally, the increase in accumbal-thalamic connectivity was also coupled with craving-related glutamate rise in the nucleus accumbens. Yet, N-acetylcysteine had no impact on craving-related changes in functional connectivity. Together, these results suggest that connectivity changes within the fronto-accumbal-thalamic loop, in conjunction with impaired glutamatergic transmission, underlie cocaine craving and related clinical symptoms, pinpointing the thalamus as a crucial hub for cocaine craving in humans.\n\nKeywords: Cocaine craving, Nucleus accumbens, Prefrontal cortex, Thalamus, Functional connectivity, Glutamate\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSubstance use disorders (SUD) are characterized by complex alterations in brain functioning, both at the molecular and the network level (Lüscher and Malenka, 2011). A key symptom of SUD is craving, as it often intrudes into the daily lives of affected individuals, dominating their thoughts, generating an uncontrollable urge to use the substance, and thereby causing considerable distress (Tiffany and Wray, 2017, Vafaie and Kober, 2022). Craving is particularly pronounced for cocaine use disorder (CUD), and thus, increases vulnerability for relapse into cocaine use (Paliwal et al., 2008). Consequently, CUD is difficult to treat and often chronic in nature. Despite decades of research, it remains a substantial global health challenge (Degenhardt et al., 2018) as no approved pharmacotherapy exists (Quednow and Herdener, 2016). Hence, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the symptoms of CUD, such as craving, need to be identified.\n\nAt the core of reward processing, the prerequisite for acquiring adaptive goal-directed behaviours, is the fronto-basal ganglia circuit (Haber and Knutson, 2009). Within this circuitry, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is a major hub receiving and integrating predominantly inputs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the midbrain, which allows reward-based learning (Haber and Knutson, 2009). Learning and memory are based on reorganisation of synaptic connections and such forms of synaptic plasticity occur also with the development of SUD (for overview see (Gipson et al., 2014, Robinson and Kolb, 2004)). Specifically, repeated use of psychoactive substances leads to long-lasting structural alterations in dendrites and dendritic spines in the NAcc and the PFC (Gipson et al., 2014, Robinson and Kolb, 2004), suggesting that neuroplastic alterations mediate the transition from recreational to compulsive substance use.\n\nFor the reinforcing properties of cocaine and other psychoactive substances, dopaminergic mechanisms in the PFC and the NAcc seem to be crucial (Volkow et al., 2019), whereas maintenance of CUD is accompanied by altered glutamatergic signalling between the PFC and the NAcc, disrupting adaptive behaviour while promoting addictive behaviour (Scofield et al., 2016). Specifically, after chronic cocaine administration, decreased basal extracellular glutamate concentrations in the NAcc are observed during withdrawal from cocaine (David A Baker et al., 2003). In turn, reinstatement of cocaine-seeking via cues, stress, or cocaine probes results in elevated glutamate release at the prefrontal synapse into the NAcc (Bell et al., 2000, McFarland et al., 2003, Park et al., 2002, Pierce et al., 1996, Pierce et al., 1997, Reid and Berger, 1996). Subsequently, there is an overflow of extracellular glutamate in the NAcc, which is linked to augmented substance-seeking behaviour (Cornish et al., 1999, Cornish and Kalivas, 2000, McFarland et al., 2003, Park et al., 2002). Yet, this cascade of events can be blocked by compromising the dorsal PFC (for overview see (Moorman et al., 2015)), or by the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine through normalisation of extracellular glutamate concentrations in the NAcc (Baker et al., 2003a, Baker et al., 2003b). Thus, preclinical data indicate that morphological and glutamatergic changes within the PFC-NAcc circuitry play a crucial role in reinstatement of cocaine-seeking, and thus, potentially in chronification of cocaine use in humans.\n\nIn humans, the fronto-accumbal pathway also appears to be implicated in craving, with the PFC showing reduced basal activity in individuals with SUD, while both the PFC and the NAcc show increased reactivity toward substance-related cues, which is accompanied by heightened craving (Huang et al., 2018, Kilts et al., 2001, Sehl et al., 2021, Volkow et al., 1999). In turn, when cigarettes cravings are intentionally downregulated by smokers, activity in parts of the PFC, the NAcc, and the VTA is reduced (Kober et al., 2010). A recent review points out altered fronto-striatal functional connectivity (FC) in individuals with SUD who experienced a relapse compared to individuals who maintained abstinence (Moeller and Paulus, 2018). Together, those findings from task-related fMRI studies indicate that the PFC and the NAcc are crucially involved in cue reactivity and thus their hyperresponsiveness may mediate craving. However, although necessary for treatment development, mechanistic insights into the precise processes underlying craving in the human brain remain limited, as the FC and its relationships with the glutamate system in the NAcc during craving have not yet been investigated.\n\nRecently, though, impaired glutamate homeostasis in the NAcc has been observed in individuals with CUD (ICUD), as evidenced by decreased levels in a withdrawal state and increased levels in a cue-induced craving state measured by proton magnetic resonance imaging (1H-MRS; (Engeli et al., 2020)), analogous to the preclinical data (McFarland et al., 2003, Scofield et al., 2016). This finding is supported by a study in which lower glutamate levels in the dorsal striatum were observed in association with habitual behaviour in ICUD (Ersche et al., 2021) and evidence of glutamatergic impairments – albeit less consistent – in other parts of the brain in individuals with SUD (Moeller et al., 2016).\n\nPotentially by targeting the glutamate homeostasis, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has shown therapeutic effects in ICUD by reducing cocaine craving and cocaine use (Dakwar et al., 2014, Dakwar et al., 2017, Dakwar et al., 2019). Also, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the dorsolateral or medial PFC in ICUD has recently been tested in proof-of-concept studies, indicating immediate effects on alcohol- and cocaine-related cue reactivity, cocaine craving, and even prolonged effects on cocaine use (Camprodon et al., 2007, Kearney-Ramos et al., 2018, Politi et al., 2008, Steele et al., 2019).\n\nYet, to date, despite the increasing interest in combining resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with 1H-MRS in patients with SUD (Kohut and Kaufman, 2020), no study investigated functional connectivity and its potential link to glutamatergic impairments in the NAcc in individuals with SUD and particularly not during a craving state (Kohut and Kaufman, 2020, Moeller et al., 2016). For this reason, it remains unclear whether connectivity changes within the PFC-NAcc circuitry also underlie craving in human CUD, and whether those potential adaptations are associated with disruptions of the glutamate homeostasis in the NAcc. To this end, we investigated FC of the NAcc together with glutamate concentrations in the NAcc by combining rs-fMRI and 1H-MRS in ICUD and in matched healthy control individuals (HCI) during different functional states, i.e., in a craving and non-craving condition. Based on preclinical and clinical evidence, we hypothesized significant alterations in FC within the network of PFC-NAcc in ICUD which are in turn expected to be associated with glutamatergic changes in the NAcc. Additionally, we tested if a challenge of N-acetylcysteine affects accumbal network connectivity and associated glutamate concentrations, as N-acetylcysteine has shown to restore glutamate homeostasis in the NAcc and thereby inhibit reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in animal models of addiction (McClure et al., 2014).\n\n2. Methods and materials\n\n2.1. Participants\n\nThe study was authorised by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich (No.: 2014-0010), and all participants gave written informed consent prior to study participation according to the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was part of a multimodal imaging study (more data presented elsewhere; Engeli et al., 2020).\n\nGeneral inclusion criterion for ICUD and HCI was age between 18 – 50 years, and general exclusion criteria included severe somatic diseases, neurological disorders, a family history of severe DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders, previous head injury, contraindication to magnet resonance imaging, allergy to N-acetylcysteine, pregnancy, lack of contraception, and concurrent participation in another clinical trial.\n\nInclusion criteria for ICUD were average cocaine use of ≥ 1 g/week within the last six months and a diagnosis of cocaine dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Exclusion criteria for ICUD were other current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders, except attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tobacco dependence.\n\nExclusion criteria of HCI were current and past regular use of psychoactive substances with exception of regular alcohol and irregular cannabis use. All DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders, except tobacco dependence, also lead to the exclusion of HCI. Trained psychologists screened all participants for current DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998), and for psychoactive substances use with the Interview for Psychotropic Drug Consumption (Quednow et al., 2004). All participants received a financial compensation either after completion and or after discontinuation of the study.\n\nICUD completed the severity of dependence scale (SDS; Gossop et al., 1995) and the Obsessive-Compulsive Cocaine Use Scale (OCCUS) that captures cocaine craving in the past weeks by assessing obsessive thoughts about cocaine and the compulsive drive to use cocaine (Hormes et al., 2012). All participants were asked to refrain from alcohol for 48 h and from illicit substances for 72 h before both MRI sessions. Compliance with abstinence from illicit substances was confirmed by self-reports and urine samples. Smoking nicotine was allowed until one hour before the MRI measurements.\n\n2.2. Study design\n\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced crossover study, (see ), to capture potential alterations in accumbal FC and its link to accumbal glutamate and in a cue-induced craving state compared to a neutral state and to assess the potential restoring impact of N-acetylcysteine on those neurobiological alterations compared to a placebo. To this end, identical MRI procedures were performed in two sessions on separate days, once under N-acetylcysteine and once under the placebo. In each MRI session, a 1H-MRS and a rs-fMRI sequence were first performed during a neutral state. After a short break, those two MRI sequences were repeated during a craving state triggered by the craving paradigm (see description below).\n\n2.3. Craving paradigm\n\nTo induce cocaine craving in ICUD, two films were presented to both groups. The first film served as a control condition by presenting video clips of a chess game (neutral film). The second film was implemented to provoke the desire to use cocaine by showing clips of cocaine use (cocaine film; for more details see (Engeli et al., 2020)). The order of the films was not randomised to avoid potential carry-over effects of cocaine craving. Both films were shown while participants were in the MR scanner to a) measure basal glutamate (during the neutral film) and craving-induced glutamate levels (during the cocaine film) using 1H-MRS and b) state-dependent FC using rs-fMRI which was performed immediately after each film.\n\nTo ensure that a craving state was induced by the cocaine film and sustained during both MRI sequences, participants rated their subjective craving for cocaine on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 with intervals of 0.25 (0 = no craving; 10 = strong craving), directly before and after each film and each scan.\n\n2.4. Pharmacological challenge\n\nParticipants took the first dose of either 2400 mg N-acetylcysteine or placebo at home one day before the first MRI session, 1200 mg in the morning and 1200 mg in the evening. On the day of MRI session, the second dose of 2400 mg was taken all at once one hour before the 1H-MRS measurement on site, as the peak plasma concentration of N-acetylcysteine occurs 1 – 2 h after ingestion (Holdiness, 1991).\n\nThe dosage and duration of the N-acetylcysteine challenge was selected based on previous studies demonstrating safety and tolerability (Mardikian et al., 2007) and indicating potential efficacy (McClure et al., 2014). The placebo was administrated in identical capsules containing mannitol. After the first MRI session, there was a wash-out period, which was followed by the second MRI session where participants received the other pharmacological challenge.\n\n2.5. Resting state fMRI: data acquisition\n\nMagnetic resonance images were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3 T whole-body scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) equipped with a 32-channel head coil. First, as a structural reference, high-resolution anatomical images were obtained using a T1-weighted 3D scan with a fast field echo sequence over 10 min (repetition time = “shortest”, echo time = “shortest”, flip angle = 8°, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm, field of view = 240 × 240 mm).\n\nFunctional images were collected using a sensitivity-encoded single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence over 6 min (repetition time = 2000 ms, echo time = 35 ms, flip angle = 82°, axial slices = 30, matrix = 80×80, slice thickness = 4 mm, slice gap = 0.29 mm, field of view = 220 × 220 mm2, voxel size = 2.75 mm × 2.75 mm, number of volumes = 300, sensitivity-encoding reduction factor = 2.0). During the functional scan, participants were asked to lie still with their eyes closed, to relax while staying awake.\n\n2.6. Resting state fMRI data: preprocessing\n\nPreprocessing was performed using the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI toolkit (DPARSF; https://www.rfmri.org (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010, Yan et al., 2016)) in Matlab 2020a (The Mathworks, Natick, U.S.A., https://www.mathworks.com) which is based on SPM12 functions (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Standard preprocessing procedures were applied, which included a correction for slice scan timing acquisition, realignment to the first volume using rigid body transformation, normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space using DARTEL algorithm (Ashburner, 2007) with a final reslicing to voxel resolution of 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, and spatial smoothing using a 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel.\n\n2.7. Resting state fMRI data: seed-based analysis\n\nSeed-based FC analyses were performed, with the left NAcc defined as seed region based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas. This analysis was performed in BrainVoyager (Maastricht, The Netherlands, https://www.brainvoyager.com) after transforming both atlas regions and anatomical and functional data sets to Talairach space using the Matlab COM interface. Mean time-courses from the seed regions were extracted from each individual functional data set using the Matlab-BrainVoyager interface toolbox Neuroelf (https://neuroelf.org). To compute FC maps, the seed time-course was correlated against the time course of each voxel of the brain, thereby separate Pearson correlation maps were produced for each subject and each scan (for details see Supplement). In BrainVoyager, a 3-way mixed-effects ANOVA design was specified with two within-subject factors (“film: neutral vs. cocaine”, “challenge: placebo vs. N-acetylcysteine”) and one between-subject factor (“group: HCI vs. ICUD”). Additionally, a 2-way mixed-effects ANOVA design without the within-subject factor “challenge” was applied to examine only the placebo condition. To protect against false positives and correct for all voxel-wise comparisons, only statistically significant regional effects were displayed for compact clusters surviving the joint application of a voxel-level (p = 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons) and a cluster-level threshold (p ≤ 0.05, FDR; for details see Supplement).\n\nThe regional functional estimates (mean z connectivity) were compared between groups regarding their potential relationships with accumbal glutamate levels using an ANCOVA model with the between-subject factor “group”. Further, we correlated the increase in FC from the neutral to the cue-induced craving state (delta between neutral and cocaine film) with clinical variables in ICUD via a robust (weighted) linear regression model in Matlab (for details see Supplement).\n\nAfter quality checks based on head motion estimates, eight ICUD and four HCI were excluded from analyses as at least one of the four scans did not pass the criteria (for details see Supplement). Thus, all four scans from 15 ICUD and 22 HCI could be included into the 3-factor ANOVA model and 18 ICUD and 23 HCI into the 2-factor ANOVA model. The robust linear regression models were performed with thirteen ICUD, as two ICUD were excluded due to outlier data (cocaine use) or missing data (cocaine craving), respectively.\n\n2.8. Resting state fMRI data: granger causality analysis\n\nAs part of an exploratory approach, a multivariate vector Granger causality (MVGC) analysis was performed to complement the seed-based FC analysis with an effective connectivity analysis using the MVGC toolbox in Matlab (Barnett and Seth, 2014). MVGC is a method that can be used to infer the causal influence between brain regions (Seth et al., 2015) starting from their associated time-series. The mean rs-fMRI time-courses from selected regions were first submitted to a second-order vector autoregressive (VAR) model using an ordinary least square fitting procedure. Then, the autocovariance matrix was estimated to calculate the pairwise-conditional Granger causality terms expressing the directional (causal) influences from one region to another. Finally, for any two regions x and y included in the same VAR model, the difference between these terms (dGC = Fx → y − Fy → x) was used to quantify the extent to which a dominant direction of influence exists, making such difference significantly positive or significantly negative depending on the direction of influence. Thus, for each pair of regions included in the VAR model, the obtained dGC estimates were statistically compared against zero in each experimental group and each film condition via two-tailed one-sample t-tests and analysed between conditions and groups via repeated measures ANOVA.\n\n2.9. 1H-MRS: data acquisition and analysis\n\nGlutamate in the NAcc was quantified using a small-voxel 1H-MRS protocol consisting of a non-water suppressed Point-RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) preceded by a metabolite-cycling pulse (repetition time = 2500 ms, echo time = 32 ms, spectral bandwidth = 2000 Hz; Hock et al., 2012). Inner-volume saturation was implemented to reduce chemical shift displacement errors between metabolites, and to reduce flow artefacts. The 1H-MRS voxel (effective size = 9.4 × 18.8 × 8.4 mm3) was positioned over the left NAcc. A total of 512 signals were achieved within four blocks over 22.5 min. The spectral signal was quantified with LCModel (Provencher, 1993). To achieve an absolute quantification of metabolites, we applied the principle of reciprocity (Zoelch et al., 2018). More detailed description is provided elsewhere (Engeli et al., 2020).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Participants\n\nIn total, 41 participants (14 females) with mean age of 30.1 years (± 5.5 s.d., range: 19.2 – 45.7) were included in the rs-fMRI analysis. The groups of ICUD and HCI were matched regarding age, sex, education, verbal intelligence, and smoking status (NICUD = 18, NHCI = 23). On average, ICUD used cocaine 3.4 times (± 1.9 s.d., range: 0.5 – 7) and 6.4 g/week (±11.9 s.d., range: 1–52.5) over the last six months. The median wash-out interval between N-Acetylcysteine and placebo was 14.0 (range 10 – 18). For detailed characterization of the sample, see Supplementary Tab. S1 and S2.\n\n3.2. Craving induction\n\nThe cocaine film strongly increased craving ratings on a visual analogue scale in ICUD but not in HCI (ANOVA: pre vs. post film; main effect of group F(1, 39) = 59.52, p < 0.00000001, main effect of film F(1, 39) = 27.14, p < 0.00001, interaction effect group-by-film F(1, 39) = 27.14, p < 0.00001, NICUD = 18, NHCI = 23). This indicates that the ICUD were in a cue-induced craving state during and after the presentation of the cocaine film and thus during the 1H-MRS and rs-fMRI measurements.\n\nTo enable clear identification of the different craving measures in the subsequent presentation of results, we will introduce a distinctive terminology: A) the self-reported cravings assessed with a visual analogue scale before and after the presentation of a neutral and a cocaine film will be referred to as “cue-induced craving ratings”. B) Since the cue-induced craving ratings were significantly increased, ICUD were in a craving state during and after the presentation of the cocaine film and thus during the 1H-MRS and rs-fMRI measurements. Therefore, the cocaine film condition will be referred to as “cue-induced craving state (cocaine film)” while the neutral film condition will be termed “neutral state (neutral film)”. C) The self-reported craving in the past weeks assessed with the multi-item questionnaire OCCUS (Hormes et al., 2012) will be referred to as “craving in the past weeks”.\n\n3.3. 1H-MRS data quality\n\nThe spectral data was of good spectral quality, allowing reliable comparisons of accumbal glutamate levels ( and Fig. S1).\n\nTable 1\n\nMeans.d.RangeSNR17.43±2.5511–24Linewidth6.92±1.264.34–11.75CRLB %5.11±1.193–11\n\n3.4. Resting state fMRI data: seed-based analysis\n\nAs the glutamate levels were assessed in the left NAcc, the left NAcc was used as the seed region for the resting-state analysis. A 3-way ANOVA (factors: “film”, “challenge”, and “group”) revealed a significant group-by-film interaction with an anterior midline region of the left thalamus (Tha; centre of mass: −9, +9, −2, p ≤ 0.05, cluster-level corrected, NICUD = 15 NHCI = 22). Thus, ICUD showed significantly higher connectivity between NAcc and Tha in the cue-induced craving state (cocaine film) than the HCI at the whole brain level ( ). There was no significant connectivity with any other cluster and no difference between the placebo and the N-acetylcysteine condition for either group.\n\nSince there was no pharmacological effect, a 2-way ANOVA considering only the placebo scans of each subject was computed (NICUD = 18 NHCI = 23). A significant group-by-film interaction in the dorsolateral PFC, specifically a cluster in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), was revealed (incl. BA9, centre of mass: −20, +48, +45, p ≤ 0.05, cluster-level corrected). Thereby, ICUD showed significantly higher connectivity between the NAcc and the SFG during the craving condition than the HCI at the whole brain level ( ). There was no significant connectivity with any other cluster.\n\nThe post-hoc analysis of the regional scores highlighted a significant increase of both the NAcc-Tha and the NAcc-SFG seed-based FC in ICUD vs. HCI in the comparison between the neutral and the cue-induced craving state (neutral vs. cocaine film). The difference between groups in the NAcc-Tha FC was revealed in the 3-factor model integrating placebo and verum scans, meaning that the differential effects were significant under both placebo and N-acetylcysteine. In contrast, the difference between the groups in the NAcc-SFG FC was found only in the placebo condition, hence the differential effects disappeared under N-acetylcysteine. There were nevertheless no significant interaction effects with the pharmacological challenge.\n\n3.5. Resting state fMRI data: link to disease severity and glutamate homeostasis\n\nHowever, no relationship was found between cue-induced craving ratings and connectivity during the cue-induced craving state (cocaine film). Whereas when testing the covariance of FC and glutamate concentrations in the NAcc during the cue-induced craving state (cocaine film), NAcc-Tha FC in ICUD was significantly more coupled with accumbal glutamate (see ), which is known to increase during cocaine craving and -seeking (Engeli et al., 2020, Kalivas, 2009), than in HCI (group effect F = 9.93, p = 0.0035, slope effect F = 5.35, p = 0.027, NICUD = 15, NHCI = 22). In contrast, glutamate levels neither covaried with NAcc-Tha FC during the neutral state (neutral film; p > 0.16) nor with NAcc-SFG FC during both film conditions (p ≥ 0.28).\n\nTo test whether the observed craving-dependent increase in FC depended on the severity of CA, the relationship of the FC delta (FC after the cocaine film minus FC after the neutral film; Δ FC) and behaviours and cognitions related to CUD were tested in robust linear regression models. The craving-related Δ FC NAcc-Tha was positively correlated with the severity of CUD as indicated by a positive correlation with the duration (p = 0.01) and the amount of the current cocaine use (p = 0.0003) and cocaine craving in the past weeks (OCCUS (Hormes et al., 2012); p = 0.037, ). In contrast, Δ FC NAcc-Tha was neither correlated with film-induced craving intensity rated on a visual analogue scale nor with scores on the SDS (p ≥ 0.8). Also, no significant relationship between ΔFC NAcc-SFG and any severity measures of CUD were found (p ≥ 0.09).\n\n3.6. Resting state fMRI data: granger causality analysis\n\nTo infer the causal influence between brain regions, regional rs-fMRI time series were extracted from the left NAcc, left Tha, and left SFG to estimate the effective connectivity between each pair of regions in a tri-variate model which was applied to the placebo scans (NICUD = 18, NHCI = 23). Between NAcc and Tha, the mean differential Granger Causality (dGC) model estimate was significantly different from zero in the craving condition, in HCI (one-sample t-test: p < 0.011) but not in ICUD (one-sample paired t-test: p = 0.13). The dGC sign indicates a directional influence from NAcc to Tha only in the HCI group, with a significant film-by-group interaction in a 2-way ANOVA model (p = 0.004). When considering the effective connectivity between NAcc and SFG, we found no evidence of a directional influence both within and between groups.\n\nWhen analysing the effective connectivity between SFG and Tha, the mean dGC was significantly different from zero in the craving condition in ICUD (one-sample t-test: p = 0.012) but not in HCI (one-sample paired t-test: p = 0.24). The dGC sign indicates a directional influence from SFG to the Tha only in ICUD, the film-by-group interaction showing a non-significant trend in a 2-way ANOVA model (p = 0.06). The overall pattern of functional and effective connectivity that emerges from these analyses is summarised schematically in .\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis is the first study to investigate FC during an experimentally induced state of cocaine craving and the potential link between craving-related FC changes and accumbal glutamate alterations in the NAcc. To this end, we acquired 1H-MRS and rs-fMRI data during and after exposure to a neutral film and a cocaine film, an experimental paradigm that has previously shown to induce sustained cocaine craving and increased accumbal glutamate levels in ICUD (Engeli et al., 2020). Furthermore, we tested the effect of N-acetylcysteine versus placebo on connectivity changes. We found distinct craving-related patterns of functional and effective connectivity within a fronto-accumbal-thalamic network in ICUD compared to HCI that were, in addition, associated with accumbal glutamate and disease severity.\n\n4.1. Accumbal connectivity during cocaine craving\n\nSpecifically, we observed increased FC between the NAcc and the dorsolateral PFC (SFG/BA9) in ICUD during a cue-induced craving state (cocaine film), which were assessed by craving scores that were rated by participants on a visual analogue scale. This alteration in the fronto-accumbal FC is in line with the fact that cue-induced substance-seeking is associated with enhanced synaptic strength within the PFC-NAcc pathway, thus, allowing for intensified neural signalling (for overview see (Spencer and Kalivas, 2017)). With rising synaptic strength, the intensity of substance-seeking increases, while both decrease when satiation is temporarily achieved. As soon as the motivation for substance-seeking is renewed, synaptic strength increases again. Thus, oscillations in synaptic strength tightly accompany different motivational states within the cycle of substance-seeking. Accordingly, the observed FC changes between the NAcc and the dorsolateral PFC in abstinent and thus non-satiated ICUDs after exposure to cocaine stimuli might reflect a highly motivated state to strive for cocaine.\n\nFurther, preclinical data have consistently shown that overexcitement of the PFC by a cocaine challenge or cue is paralleled by glutamatergic overflow in the NAcc, which is associated with intensified substance-seeking (Kalivas, 2009). Recently, we were able to verify the translational validity of the animal-based glutamate homeostasis hypothesis of addiction (Kalivas, 2009), by showing decreased basal glutamate levels in the NAcc during cocaine abstinence and, in turn, increased levels during stimulation with cocaine cues (Engeli et al., 2020). Here, we expanded on these previous findings by further examining the relationship between those regional neurometabolic changes and FC alterations at the network level. However, in contrast to the preclinical data, no significant link was observed here between the increased NAcc-PFC FC and accumbal glutamate levels during the cue-induced craving state (cocaine film).\n\nConversely, we found that FC between the NAcc and a midline part of the Tha was heightened in ICUD during cocaine craving, and that its magnitude was predicted by the intensity of current cocaine use and general cocaine craving and was accompanied by increased craving-induced glutamate levels in the NAcc. This is consistent with preclinical evidence suggesting that the midline Tha, and particularly the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) as a midline thalamic structure, contributes to goal-directed behaviour in general (Kirouac, 2015), and specifically in SUD (Zhou and Zhu, 2019). Rodent studies suggest that deactivating the PVT impedes cocaine-related behaviour (Browning et al., 2014, James et al., 2010, Matzeu et al., 2015, Wunsch et al., 2017, Young and Deutch, 1998) and reported a causal role for the PVT-NAcc pathway in reinstatement of alcohol-seeking (Hamlin et al., 2009). Recently, inputs from the PVT to the NAcc have been identified as critical facilitators of physical symptoms and aversive memories of opioid withdrawal (Zhu et al., 2016). Moreover, retrieval of opioid-associated memories was disrupted by transient inhibition of the PVT-NAcc pathway, which long-lastingly prevented relapse (Keyes et al., 2020). Also, cocaine-seeking and cocaine-induced accumbal glutamate release were blocked by inhibition of ventromedial/midline parts of the Tha (McKee et al., 2010, Neumann et al., 2016). Moreover, current evidence demonstrates that the PVT-NAcc pathway drives heroin relapse after abstinence, while extinction learning diminishes plasticity in the PVT-NAcc pathway and thereby attenuates its drive on relapse (Giannotti et al., 2021). Together, these findings indicate that glutamatergic PVT-NAcc projections are critical for reinstatement of substance-seeking. This is consistent with the link between the changes in accumbal-thalamic FC and in accumbal glutamate levels that we found here during a cue-induced craving state (cocaine film). Thus, signalling between midline Tha and NAcc appears to be critically involved in cocaine craving and to mediate, at least partially, craving-induced glutamate increase in the NAcc in humans.\n\n4.2. The role of the thalamus in addiction\n\nIn humans, the seminal work of Volkow and colleagues showed differential dopaminergic response to methylphenidate in the NAcc and the Tha in ICUD compared to HCI (Volkow et al., 1997). While diminished accumbal response was associated with reduced “high” experience, higher thalamic response to methylphenidate was associated with increased cocaine craving, suggesting a participation of the Tha in the development of CUD (Volkow et al., 1997). Lately, studies consistently found altered FC density for the Tha following acute and chronic alcohol use (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2017), and a link between thalamic FC and severity of tobacco use disorder, cigarette craving, and relapse (Lor et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2020). Glutamate levels in the Tha in abstinent individuals with alcohol use disorder appear to be significantly elevated and strongly correlated with their past drinking behaviour (Wiers et al., 2020). Recently, using a machine learning approach applied to multiple neuroimaging studies, a neural signature that includes not only the PFC and the NAcc, but also the midline Tha, was identified that predicts self-reported craving and distinguishes between individuals with and without SUD (Koban et al., 2022).\n\nAlthough craving refers to the striving for a reinforcing substance, it creates distress at the same time (Carelli and West, 2014). Given the appetitive and aversive elements of craving, the increased Tha-NAcc FC during a cue-induced craving state (cocaine film) linked to self-reports of general cocaine craving in the past weeks integrates well into accounts of the PVT’s particular role in selecting between competing motivational demands, and thus might represent an approach-avoidance dilemma (McNally, 2021). Accordingly, in healthy humans, the mediodorsal Tha shows increased activity during anticipation of both reward and punishment (Knutson et al., 2001). With an equivalent task in ICUD, future studies could test the role of the Tha in anticipation of punishment, of natural as well as cocaine-related rewards.\n\n4.3. Different approaches to capture craving\n\nWhile connectivity changes were significantly related to general cocaine craving in the past weeks (as assessed by a questionnaire), contrary to our hypothesis, we found no correlation with the intensity of immediate cue-induced craving ratings (as assessed by a visual analogue scale). It has been debated, however, that multi-item questionnaires are better suited than single-item scales to capture the multi-faceted nature of craving, and thereby, to overcome the reduced capacity to introspect inner states in individuals with SUD (Rosenberg, 2009, Tiffany et al., 2000), as seen in clinical and laboratory settings (Goldstein et al., 2009, Moeller et al., 2014).\n\n4.4. Link between changes in functional connectivity and in glutamate levels\n\nWhile the hypothesized increase in NAcc-PFC FC during cocaine craving was confirmed, the anticipated relationship with glutamatergic alterations and severity of SUD was not observed. Nonetheless, animal models of addiction consistently describe the cue-induced over-stimulation of the PFC-NAcc pathway as consequential to an overflow of glutamate in the NAcc and critical for cocaine-seeking (for overview see (Kalivas, 2009, Scofield et al., 2016)). The present study design might have missed this link due to the non-simultaneous measurement of glutamate and FC. Simultaneous measures, such as 1H-MRS interleaved with rs-fMRI (Ip et al., 2017), would potentially allow to capture this link between the PFC-NAcc FC and accumbal glutamate release as evidenced by animal data. Since the Tha is thought to play a regulatory role within the reward circuit (Haber and Knutson, 2009), it could serve as a modulatory component for the PFC-initiated release of accumbal glutamate and thus cocaine craving. To confirm this idea, a study with craving induction assessing simultaneously rs-fMRI-1H-MRS should be performed in individuals with SUD.\n\nWe also observed an effective connectivity from the dorsolateral PFC to the mid Tha in ICUD during the cue-induced craving state (cocaine film) compared to HCI. This finding is consistent with the recently established role of the PFC-PVT pathway in reward processing (Otis et al., 2017, Otis et al., 2019) and its direct involvement in cocaine-seeking (Giannotti et al., 2018, Kuhn et al., 2021), suggesting an important role of the prefrontal signalling to the mid Tha in maladaptive reward processing in SUD, as during anticipation of cocaine-related rewards. As a limitation, however, it should be noted that the change in FC between the Tha and the NAcc was not included among the a priori hypotheses of the study and therefore the analysis of effective connectivity was exploratory in nature.\n\n4.5. Selective effects of N-acetylcysteine\n\nContrary to our hypothesis and preclinical experiments, N-acetylcysteine had no effect on connectivity patterns in ICUD, which is, however, consistent with the previously observed lack of effects of the same drug on glutamate levels in this group of ICUD (Engeli et al., 2020). As the N-acetylcysteine administration here was short (two days) compared to that applied in animal studies, further studies are needed to test whether longer treatment durations have an impact on craving-induced FC and associated glutamate levels. However, previous trials investigating the effect of N-acetylcysteine on cocaine craving and cocaine use have shown incongruency in results, which might be attributed to the different stages of SUD examined across those studies (Gipson, 2016). It is plausible that N-acetylcysteine is only effective in ICUD after prolonged abstinence, as opposed to those who are currently using cocaine (Gipson, 2016). Since high dropout rates in studies with ICUD (Lappan et al., 2020) lead to reduced statistical power, future studies should examine greater populations to test the effect of N-acetylcysteine at different stages of SUD.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nTaken together, the present observations point to complex adaptations in the fronto-accumbal-thalamic circuitry as critical for the development of characteristic features of SUD and thereby extend current models of network-level neuroplastic changes in a fronto-accumbal loop. These findings are in line with neuroanatomical evidence (Haber and Calzavara, 2009) and initial preclinical data (Giannotti et al., 2021, Keyes et al., 2020, Zhou and Zhu, 2019). We conclude that the midline Tha with its glutamatergic projections to the NAcc represents an important hub within the reward system in humans, and that CUD involves changes in thalamic connectivity with the dorsolateral PFC and the NAcc that might drive cocaine craving. These findings open avenues for novel therapeutic approaches to treat CUD that should be tested by future trials using latest developments of brain stimulation techniques (Creed et al., 2015, Lüscher, 2016, Steele, 2021) or fMRI-connectivity neurofeedback (Koush et al., 2013, Martz et al., 2020, Watanabe et al., 2017) complemented by pharmacotherapies targeting the glutamate system (Scofield et al., 2016) to specifically counterbalance the dysfunctional neuroadaptations within the fronto-accumbal-thalamic circuitry underlying cocaine craving in humans.\n\nFunding\n\nThe project was funded by the Zurich Center for Integrative Human Physiology, University of Zurich.\n\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nEtna J.E.
