        "text": "14\n\n“No Concessions Without Counter-Concessions”\n\nANNOUNCEMENT of General Clay’s return halted the drift of Germany toward neutralism. It did not, however, restore Chancellor Adenauer’s waning prestige. Indeed, it is unlikely that this was intended. The aging Chancellor was viewed by most of the new young men in Washington as the principal stumbling block to reopening negotiations. Should he gently be retired from office, a new overture could be made toward the East; an overture with double chance of success now that the refugee problem had been solved.\n\nEarly election returns on September 17 encouraged this view. Clearly, the Chancellor had lost his majority. When the counting was over, Adenauer’s Christian Democratic Union had received but forty-five percent of the total vote. Its seats in the Bundestag numbered 242—eight less than necessary to form a government and thirty-seven less than the previous session. The SPD of Willy Brandt had won 190 seats (versus 169 in the previous session) and the Free Democrats 67 (versus 49). A coalition government would have to be formed.\n\nFor Adenauer, the results were particularly galling. He, of all people, had been blamed by the German electorate for events in Berlin. Ironically, part of the criticism was justified. When the Western Foreign Ministers met in Paris on August 7 and 8, Adenauer had accepted the Anglo-American view that a closing of the sector boundary would ease tensions in Berlin. When Mayor Brandt advised the Chancellor’s Foreign Minister, Dr. Heinrich von Brentano, of the inherent danger of such a move, the latter had turned a deaf ear.a When the border closure did come, Ernst Lemmer, Adenauer’s leader in Berlin, announced over a television hookup on the evening of August 13 that the measures were not a surprise. From Bonn, Dr. Adenauer himself pleaded for calm and the following day in Regensburg gave his now famous diatribe against “Herr Brandt, alias Framm.”\n\nDuring the week following August 13, Adenauer stuck closely to Washington’s line that the border closure represented a propaganda victory for the West; that it was not something to get excited about. He at first denied Brandt’s request for a special session of the Bundestag and continued campaigning as though nothing had happened. Belatedly, on Saturday, August 19, he asked to accompany Vice President Johnson to Berlin but was turned down. This was a severe blow to the Chancellor, for he had staked his future on American support. Having acquiesced to Anglo-American insistence on the border closure, der Alte could not understand the refusal of the American Administration to bail him out. Four years before, in 1957, when there was still some doubt as to West German interest in rearmament and when the ohne mich movement was at its height, John Foster Dulles had outspokenly endorsed Adenauer’s re-election and the Chancellor undoubtedly was remembering this. But now there was a new group in Washington and no support was tendered. When he arrived at Tempelhof three days later, it was understood throughout Germany that the Chancellor had come too late.b\n\nDuring the next several weeks Dr. Adenauer energetically tried to recoup his losses and did eventually succeed in curtailing the bitterness in the Federal Republic which had arisen over Allied inaction on August 13. Over the undoubted discomfiture of numerous Presidential advisers he prevailed upon Washington to return General Clay to Berlin, and all but thought he had weathered the storm.\n\nBut the resentment which most West Germans felt over the border closure perhaps subconsciously had been transferred to the Chancellor. Inside his own party there was widespread dissatisfaction at the way der Alte had handled the events of August 13, and an increasing demand for his retirement. The failure of the party to retain its absolute majority in the Bundestag was universally attributed to the Chancellor’s attitude of “politics as usual.”\n\nAccordingly, when the votes were counted and it was determined that a coalition would be necessary, the cries for Adenauer’s head rose to a crescendo. The heirs apparent within the CDU—Ludwig Ehrhard, Franz Josef Strauss, and Gerhard Schroeder—openly announced they would not support the Chancellor’s re-election in the party caucus. Erich Mende, leader of the FDP, the party with whom the coalition would have to be formed, had made the air black during the campaign with repeated avowals that his party would never join a coalition headed by Chancellor Adenauer, and now repeated this liturgy to every newsman in Bonn who would listen. The White House, which already had relegated der Alte to a place among the “has beens,” once more made no efforts on his behalf. The rumor was current in Bonn, in fact, that Washington would welcome a change to someone “more tractable” and more willing to recognize the “new realities” of the international situation—a description equally applicable to Ehrhard or Schroeder. While it would perhaps be too much to say that the wily Chancellor had been mousetrapped by Washington, it was clear that his defeat was not being looked on with alarm.\n\nIn Great Britain, where der Alte had never been popular anyway, both major parties were filled with glee at the prospect of the Chancellor’s replacement. Following a conference of Labour leader Hugh Gaitskill with Prime Minister Macmillan at Chequers, New York Times London correspondent Drew Middleton reported that both parties “discern an opportunity for a ‘basic’ discussion of the future of Germany” in light of the Chancellor’s defeat. According to Middleton: “The British have always believed that Dr. Adenauer’s dominant personality inhibited a free discussion of Germany’s future by the Western powers.”1\n\nBut if Washington and London had counted Adenauer out, it was a short count. His fighting spirit revived, the Chancellor faced down the revolt in his own party and then set about forming a new government. After receiving the backing of an admittedly reluctant caucus, he found an ally in his old adversary, the Regierende Bürgermeister of Berlin.\n\nPerhaps also smarting over the cavalier treatment he had received from Washington, Willy Brandt now played a willing foil to the Chancellor’s efforts to force the FDP into the coalition. More important, of course, Brandt feared the “new realists” more than the Old Fox. Whenever the Free Democrats balked at taking Dr. Adenauer as leader, Brandt and his lieutenants dutifully trundled over to the Palais Schaumburg for their own coalition talks with der Alte. Caught in between, Mende and the FDP quickly capitulated. The only casualty was the Chancellor’s alter ego, Dr. von Brentano, as Foreign Minister—plus a rather innocuous statement from Adenauer that he would step down “before the next election.”\n\nThe replacement of von Brentano was a public sop to the FDP. Conscious that much of their campaign had been waged on a platform of “standing up to the Chancellor,” the Free Democrats desperately needed a face-saving concession. The sacrifice of von Brentano for someone not so “subservient” to the Chancellor’s will was pictured as a likely device. A sensitive man, Brentano amicably bowed out rather than delay formation of the coalition.\n\nTo succeed Brentano, the FDP proposed Gerhard Schroeder, Minister of Interior in Adenauer’s previous cabinet, and leader of the CDU faction most “tractable” in Washington’s eyes. Since Brentano is extremely astute as well as sensitive, it is not unlikely that his voluntary withdrawal reflected his recognition that Schroeder might receive a better reception in certain Western capitals.\n\nSchroeder’s appointment was fought vigorously both by Mayor Brandt and the Berlin faction of CDU. Before being suggested by the Free Democrats, Schroeder had confided to certain Western newsmen that he favored a “realistic appraisal” of the Berlin problem. According to Sydney Gruson of the New York Times, Schroeder’s remark was interpreted as a “willingness to find a settlement with the Soviet Union that would separate West Berlin and West Germany,” and supposedly, was based on Schroeder’s assumption “that the Allies … were committed beyond their strength to maintain Berlin’s present status.”2\n\nFaced with von Brentano’s somewhat precipitant resignation, the Chancellor reluctantly accepted Dr. Schroeder as Foreign Minister. Shortly afterwards, the new Government took office. Adenauer had won, but his powers looked greatly diminished.\n\nTwo days after the West German election General Clay arrived in Berlin. Before leaving for Germany he had visited Washington for a round of top level conferences. As the President said afterwards, he felt “unusual confidence” in General Clay. All the same, the Administration was careful to keep the retired General out of any position of actual authority. His duties, as explained by the White House, would be to “report, recommend, and advise.” He would have no command function.\n\nThe reception of General Clay in Berlin was impressive. The entire eleven mile route from Tempelhof to his quarters in Wannsee was lined with cheering Berliners, frequently packed three and four deep. Enthusiastic well-wishers repeatedly crashed the police barriers to press flowers in his hand. Since the airlift, of course, the West Berliners have regarded General Clay as their personal protector. For them, the General’s return was a touching reunion. But even more, it was a guarantee of American determination.\n\nAs expected, Clay lost little time before going into action. His purpose for being in Berlin, as he explained it, was to “demonstrate United States strength and determination … and to force the Soviets to acknowledge responsibility for their sector.” One day later, on September 21, he set out to prove the former. Informed during a tour of the border that the three hundred families of the isolated West Berlin enclave of Steinstuecken had been marooned there since August 13, the General flew by helicopter over a half-mile of East German territory to visit the tiny community. Until then, the village had lost contact with the West. Technically a part of the American sector, Steinstuecken is geographically separated from the rest of Berlin by an intervening portion of East Germany. Following the construction of the Wall, the residents of the village had been virtually imprisoned. It had been ten years, in fact, since an American official had visited the enclave. In the face of the latest Communist measures, many of its residents had given up hope.\n\nBut the General’s flight quickly demonstrated U.S. resolve. Clay spent a total of forty-five minutes in Steinstuecken, chatted individually with numerous citizens, and visited publicly with the mayor in the shop-front window of the latter’s grocery. Afterwards, Clay announced he was assigning a three-man military police detachment to Steinstuecken permanently. Berlin’s morale began to revive.\n\nThe East Germans immediately attacked Clay’s flight as provocative; an infringement on the supposed sovereignty of the GDR. According to the East zone’s controlled press, it was “a warlike move in an otherwise calm situation.” The British also had doubts, and George Bailey, foreign correspondent for The Reporter, states that their objections to Washington were strenuous. “They affirmed their support of the United States in all major issues but questioned the wisdom of risking an incident over such a trifling matter.”3\n\nGeneral Clay, however, was not dissuaded. It was exactly such matters, he said, that would restore Allied prestige in the divided city if exploited properly. The Soviets, he argued, “would not allow a minor issue to become an international incident through mishandling by their East German puppets.”\n\nEvery day for the next several weeks the helicopter flights to Steinstuecken were repeated. On one occasion, seven refugees who had sought shelter there were evacuated. Again the East Germans protested, threatening even to shoot the helicopters down. Clay ignored the protests and the flights continued. More refugees were evacuated. The GDR did not intervene; no shots were fired; indeed, the flights soon became routine. As Clay had predicted, when confronted by a show of Western determination the Communists backed down.\n\nClay’s flight to Steinstuecken was only one example of his determination to place Allied relations in Berlin on an even keel. The day afterwards, at a cocktail party which he gave for Western newsmen, the General partially disclosed some of the Administration’s plans for a negotiated settlement between East and West. It is unlikely that Clay’s statement was a trial balloon. More probably, it was an attempt to acquaint Western opinion, and in particular, West German opinion, with the possibilities then being considered.\n\nThe conversation at the party supposedly was “off the record.” Clay did attempt, however, to provide the newsmen with some background information as to how the crisis was being viewed in Washington and suggested, among other things, that West Germany finally “must recognize the reality of the existence of two German states.” Regardless of the “off the record” nature of his remarks, the General’s statement rated headlines in all major papers the following morning. Although Clay himself was not initially identified—the New York Times referred to the speaker as an “authoritative United States source in Berlin”—the story caused a major sensation. Was the United States reneging on its promise to support German reunification? It certainly seemed so.\n\nLater in the day Clay himself was linked to the statement by the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, and the reaction in West Germany was immediate. The Federal Republic was being sold out, many charged, and Clay was being used as window dressing to conceal the transaction.\n\nOnly gradually did the storm subside. Following a frantic cable from Washington, General Clay issued an official denial. “There is no change in United States policy,” he said, “and no change was announced by any United States spokesman in Berlin.… We believe in and support the reunification of Germany.”4\n\nBut if this were true, why had the General spoken out the evening before? The real answer may never be known. But it is not likely that Clay was speaking “off the record” to a group of newsmen with whom he was scarcely acquainted, not expecting to see the story again. It is also unlikely that Clay was unaware of the explosive content of his remarks. Indeed, the most likely explanation is that Clay intentionally released his bombshell and fully expected the reaction which followed.\n\nIt is well to remember that at the time Clay spoke, the Rusk-Gromyko talks at the UN were in their second day. One of the principal items being considered in these talks was the question of Allied access to Berlin. Clay was aware of this. He was also aware of European fears about these talks, and the day prior to his arrival in Berlin he had discussed the situation at length with his old friend in Bonn, Konrad Adenauer. The day before that he was in Paris. Certainly he also knew that without the support of France and West Germany the talks at the UN would be fruitless. Thus, it is likely that Clay’s statement was designed to focus attention on the U.S. position in the hope of reducing later opposition should an agreement be reached. In other words, Clay was telling the West Germans that they might have to accept a greater degree of East German control over the access routes to Berlin if a permanent accord was to be hoped for.c\n\nIf it was General Clay’s purpose to call attention to the package then being prepared, Washington was not pleased. Following a round of high-level interviews in the capital, Max Frankel of the New York Times reported on September 24, that to the “chagrin” of the Kennedy Administration, “some of the specific points it considers as negotiable are being represented and misrepresented as official policy.” This was a direct reference to Clay’s comments.\n\nAlso, there is little question that Clay had correctly pictured Washington thinking. The day afterward, Assistant Senate Majority Leader Hubert Humphrey, in what was explicitly identified as an Administration policy statement, strongly endorsed a “new approach” to the East. “Talk of weakness or appeasement to describe a genuine meaningful negotiation,” he said, “would be mischievous folly.” According to the Times, Humphrey’s speech “obviously was another attempt to prepare the country for a reasonable ‘give and take’ with the Communists.”5\n\nBut if negotiations with Russia were now at a serious stage, General Clay continued to consolidate the Western position in Berlin as though nothing had happened. Before the smoke had cleared from his cocktail party remarks the General announced that U.S. military patrols along the autobahn were being resumed. Once more, Clay’s action was a case of selecting a minor issue to demonstrate American rights and thus, to restore American prestige. The autobahn patrols had been discontinued six years earlier in the face of Soviet harassment. With the increasing interference to which the East Germans were now subjecting American motorists,d Clay said the patrols were being resumed in the Allied interest.\n\nAccording to the General: “We are in Berlin by right of victory and we propose to maintain the right of access on the ground for Allied personnel and completely free access in the air corridors.”\n\nAt first there was little reaction to Clay’s move. The Soviets allowed the patrols to pass unimpeded and Allied traffic was no longer subjected to East German interference. Washington, however, saw little future in the course Clay was pursuing and continued to seek other means of settlement. Reportedly, President Kennedy sent detailed memoranda to his various lieutenants asking why his policy on Berlin was being misunderstood. To Scotty Reston, who apparently had seen the memo, the answer was obvious. According to Reston, the President “has talked like Churchill and acted like Chamberlain.”\n\nReston, in analyzing the Kennedy Administration’s concern over Berlin, further commented: “The pressure by Moscow on Berlin has forced President Kennedy and his principal aides from the universities to examine their assumptions about the cold war.… They came to power last January determined to put an end to the angry dialogue with Moscow, and were inclined to believe that the Eisenhower Administration had not paid enough attention to the sophisticated views of Allies or the yearnings of neutrals.”6 This, of course, was a clear reference to earlier British sentiment for concessions in Berlin and properly reflected the thinking of many of the President’s top level advisers.\n\nThe day following Reston’s article, President Kennedy journeyed to New York to address the United Nations. Once more Mr. Kennedy spoke in Churchillian tones. As was the case on July 25, however, the offer of concessions was thinly veiled.e Said Kennedy: “We are committed to no rigid formulas. We seek no perfect solution.… We believe a peaceful agreement is possible which protects the freedom of West Berlin … while recognizing the historic and legitimate interest of others in assuring European security.”\n\nThe President did not mention German reunification. He made no request for free all-German elections. He neither demanded that the right of free circulation be restored in Berlin or that the Wall come down. He did not refer to the city’s four-power status. Once more it was as if the United States had written off the sixteen million people of East Germany; had acquiesced to Ulbricht’s annexation of East Berlin.f\n\nIn West Germany, reaction to Kennedy’s speech was one of bitter disappointment. While Mike Mansfield hailed it as “one of the great speeches of our generation,” the Hamburg Bild Zeitung asked whether in referring to the “historic and legitimate interest of others,” Mr. Kennedy meant the right of Russia “to split Germany or that reunification must be renounced?” Heinrich von Brentano, who at that time was still West Germany’s Foreign Minister, told a CDU caucus in Bonn that the Federal Republic must “brace itself with all its strength against tendencies to get a Berlin settlement at West Germany’s expense.”\n\nEast German response to the President’s speech was noticeably different. The Ulbricht regime pulled all the stops in its propaganda organ and hailed the President’s address as a new milestone toward peaceful coexistence. According to Neues Deutschland, the official Party newspaper in East Berlin, Mr. Kennedy’s speech was “remarkable; remarkable because it showed American willingness to negotiate.”\n\nInterestingly, President Kennedy’s speech also awoke the long slumbering dinosaurs of the Republican Party. Virtually inert since the border closure on August 13, Barry Goldwater finally broke the GOP moratorium on criticism of the President’s Berlin policy to state that West German fears of Administration concessions were “perfectly justified.” “Any time diplomats begin talking of negotiations in a Soviet-created situation where there is nothing to negotiate,” said Goldwater, “ … it is the time for the defenders of freedom to become wary.”7 But Goldwater had waited so long to raise his voice against Administration policy over Berlin that his criticism had little effect. Washington continued its quest for an accord with Russia, and at the same time, moved to reduce Clay’s influence on the problem.\n\nAs has been mentioned, official Washington was becoming disturbed at the General’s resolute actions in the isolated city. Accustomed to dealing with minor representatives in Berlin who would simply carry out orders, the State Department and numerous Presidential advisers—the Bohlen-Stevenson-Schlesinger group—now found it uncomfortable with a man of Clay’s stature there. Prevented from dictating policy henceforth, these advisers determined to place further limitations on what the President’s ambassador could do. On September 27, ten days after Clay had arrived in Berlin, General Bruce C. Clarke, Commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, visited the isolated city. After a ceremonial lunch with Clay, General Clarke advised Major General Watson that the Berlin Command could no longer use U.S. forces to counteract Communist measures without clearing each action with Heidelberg. Although the prohibition was delivered to General Watson, it was a direct slap at Clay’s activities.\n\nThe Soviets were quickly apprised of the effects of Clarke’s visit. The East German press began to play up Clay’s differences with the Administration and three days afterward, the Soviet Commander in East Germany, Marshal Ivan S. Konev, delivered a sharp note to American headquarters demanding an end to the “illegal” autobahn patrols which Clay had instituted. It is more than coincidental that Konev’s demand did not come until after Washington had acted to curtail Clay’s power. The autobahn patrols had been functioning for over a week without Russian interference, and only when it became clear that Clay did not have Washington’s full support did Konev move. Then, he moved firmly. The patrols, his note stated, would have to be ended immediately. His message, he said, “was not a protest but a warning,” implying that dire consequences might follow. For Washington, this was too much. Clay was ordered to desist from the autobahn patrolling operations and another chance for a tactical victory was surrendered. Even in defeat, however, Clay had proved a point. By once more asserting his authority for autobahn operations, Marshal Konev, who until now had been conspicuously silent about East German activities, acknowledged Soviet responsibility for dealing with the Western powers.\n\nAs had been the case in 1948, however, Washington continued to press for a compromise in Berlin. Indeed, the illusion of compromise was pursued to the point of seriously endangering the Western Alliance. A Foreign Minister’s conference scheduled for London on October 15, was canceled at the last moment when France, fearing she would not be able to block the proposed concessions over Berlin, declined to attend. Two weeks before, General De Gaulle had urged the West to stand firm. Speaking to a nationwide television audience, De Gaulle stated:\n\nSince we are France, a country that is essential to Europe and necessary to the free world, it is our duty to stand firm … and to urge our Allies to do the same.\n\nFor nothing would be more dangerous to our cause, our safety, our alliance, and our peace than to retreat step by step before those who are menacing us.8\n\nBut De Gaulle’s counsel had been ignored, and so to prevent the negotiations from continuing, the President of the Fifth Republic ordered his Foreign Minister to stay home.\n\nThe major bargaining points which the U.S. was ready to offer the East at this time are worth noting. Most important, as Clay had suggested earlier, was recognition of Soviet control of eastern Germany (in Washington’s phrase, “the precise demarcation of the Communist Empire”), and de facto acceptance of the Ulbricht regime. Acceptance of the GDR, of course, would not include actual pro forma diplomatic recognition but would acknowledge East Germany’s control of the access lanes to Berlin and would mark the end of Western demands for German reunification. Indeed, renunciation of German reunification was central to the Administration’s position.\n\nThere were several reasons for this. First, most top Administration officials still saw in Germany the old scourge of Europe which had twice plunged the world into war. Many of these officials—Rusk, Stevenson, Schlesinger, Rostow—had only returned to government during the past year. Except for Rusk, their earlier service had been during the war, during the Roosevelt Administration when Germany was still Public Enemy No. 1. It is possible that this experience was still fresh. The decade of West Germany’s peaceful development, of her attachment to the West and the revival of her democratic ideals, was only something they had read about. None had participated in the formation of the new Germany and it is likely that the old prejudices lingered on. Senators Fulbright and Mansfield, who shared the Stevenson-Schlesinger view, had been in official opposition to the party in Executive power during most of these years. To them, John Foster Dulles, who together with Adenauer was the architect of the new Germany, was a personal anathema and so were his policies.\n\nNot morally committed to the idea of German reunification, it was only natural that the new men in Washington should have seen in it a valuable chattel which could be bartered to the East. The ensuing cries of anguish from West Germany which greeted these plans, only convinced those in the capital who had conceived them that they had been right all along about incipient “Pan-Germanism” and the rebirth of revanchist dogma.\n\nThe dismemberment of Germany was only one of Washington’s bargaining points. On September 30, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright, in an interview from London, suggested that the U.S. might formalize an agreement withholding nuclear weapons from West Germany. In a surprisingly all-inclusive statement, Fulbright said that atomic weapons should not be given to the Federal Republic “if there was any reasonable prospect of progress in reaching an acceptable agreement with the Soviet Union.”9 Clearly, this was another concession which Washington was dangling before Russia; a concession expressed explicitly by President Kennedy two months later.g\n\nIn addition to the acceptance of the Ulbricht regime and the explicit withholding of nuclear weapons, other possible U.S. concessions included permanent recognition of the Oder–Neisse line, negotiation of a new “contractual” arrangement for West Berlin replacing the occupation agreement, and perhaps, a loosening of ties between West Berlin and the Federal Republic. The possibility of a larger deal involving mass disarmament and a neutralized buffer zone was considered even more desirable. Indeed, the American government, for the first time since the war, was negotiating seriously with Moscow for an accord in Central Europe—an accord which could be concluded only at free Germany’s expense.\n\nBonn was well aware of Washington’s attitude. An indication of the strain which now existed between the Kennedy Administration and the Federal Republic occurred the week after Fulbright’s announcement when Willy Brandt arrived in New York to receive the 1961 Freedom House Award. When Brandt landed there was no representative of the U.S. Government to meet him. Similarly, and although the Lord Mayor had made his availability pointedly clear, no invitation to Washington was tendered. The following day, while Brandt addressed the luncheon in his honor (and remarked, incidentally, that “the Wall in Berlin must come down”), President Kennedy played host in the White House to Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. The day afterward, Mr. Kennedy did find time to call Brandt by telephone but the conversation was brief. Afterwards, the Lord Mayor ironically told waiting newsmen: “It is reassuring that the President was able to identify himself to some degree with the ideas I expressed yesterday.”10\n\nClearly, however, Brandt was not referring to his remarks about the Wall. While he was in New York, in fact, the American government ordered U.S. forces in Berlin pulled back from patrolling the Wall. Allied troops, it should be remembered, had first been ordered to the sector boundary on August 23, following the GDR’s attempt to impose a 100-meter “no-man’s land” on the Western side. Although the size of the contingents had been gradually decreased since then, U.S. military forces were still on guard. But as shootings by East German police grew increasingly frequent, Washington became alarmed about the danger of a major incident. To reduce this possibility, the troops were therefore withdrawn.\n\nAnnouncement of Washington’s action had a serious effect in Berlin. Most West Berliners saw the move as another Western retreat. The number of people quitting the city for West Germany—an average of 1,700 per week since the Wall—now rose even higher. The value of personal savings accounts already was down four percent from the pre-August 13th level. Writing from Berlin shortly afterwards, Sydney Gruson reported that the West Berliners were not hopeful. “The people a visitor speaks with—taxi drivers, the diners in a restaurant or sidewalk cafe, German newsmen and even some officials—think the Communists are winning the battle of Berlin. There is no shock, as there was right after the border was closed August 13. There is resignation and a great deal of bitterness.”11\n\nThe Allied soldiers in Berlin also were discouraged by their governments’ hesitation. The U.S. garrison, for example, is composed of eighty-five percent regular troops. The French and British contingents are similarly structured. These are professional soldiers, and they do not take risks lightly. But they appreciate the importance of their assignment and were willing, indeed eager, to do their part in the city’s defense.g Patrolling its borders was such a function, and when they were recalled, military morale hit rock bottom. As General Clay pointed out later, “to be effective, a soldier has to know he can walk a straight line.”\n\nTo head off an impending crisis, Clay moved swiftly. First, he recommended that the West Berlin border police be armed with automatic weapons. This would at least put them on an equal footing with the East German border guards. Then, seeking to regain the initiative, he decided to force the Soviets back into the city as soon as possible.\n\nAn opportunity quickly presented itself. On Sunday evening, October 22, U.S. deputy chief of mission in Berlin, Mr. Allen Lightner, drove with his wife through the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint to East Berlin. No sooner had Lightner’s car crossed the sector boundary, however, then it was stopped by East German police (Volkspolizei) demanding the diplomat’s identification. Previously, as has been mentioned,i members of the Allied occupation traveled freely from one sector of the city to another simply by virtue of the license plates on their cars. No effort was made by the East sector police to stop Western vehicles and similarly, the West Berlin police allowed Russian cars to pass uninspected. This was true whether the occupants were in uniform or civilian clothes. The license plates were deemed sufficient. This had been the practice since 1945, and was a reflection of Berlin’s occupied status. Accordingly, the East German demand to inspect Mr. Lightner’s papers was extremely significant. It was another Communist attempt to end the few remaining vestiges of four-power control.\n\nAs was customary, Lightner refused to produce his identification, stating that the United States did not recognize East German authority. When he attempted to drive on, however, several Vopos stepped in front of his car. Lightner thereupon demanded to see a Russian officer—the normal request in such circumstances—but the Vopos refused. All persons in civilian clothes entering the “capital of the German Democratic Republic,” they said, would have to show their identification to East German authority. Lightner once more refused, and for almost an hour he and his wife waited for the East Germans to open the way, but without success. Lightner thereupon turned his car around and returned to the American checkpoint.\n\nBy this time the U.S. command was aware of Lightner’s detention and an alert had been ordered. Waiting for him at Checkpoint Charlie when he returned were Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Sabolyk, U.S. provost marshal for Berlin, and the alert platoon of the 2d Battle Group. Shortly afterwards, four M–48 medium tanks and two armored personnel carriers arrived. Operating under its own initiative, the Berlin Command was closely following Clay’s instructions.\n\nAfter letting his wife out at the American checkpoint, Lightner once more drove back into East Berlin. Once more his vehicle was stopped and once more his identification was demanded. Again Lightner refused to produce it and demanded a Soviet officer. For thirty minutes Lightner waited. No Soviet officer. The Vopos still refused to allow the car to proceed. At this point, Colonel Sabolyk, who was patiently watching the episode, ordered a squad from the alert platoon to escort Lightner’s car through the barrier. With bayonets fixed, the eight men of the battle group moved out smartly, took up positions flanking the car, and then walked slowly but firmly beyond the East German barrier into East Berlin. The Vopos made no effort to interfere. Lightner drove on for a block, turned around and came back. Again the car was stopped. Again the eight-man escort moved out and conduct him back through the barrier. The East German police sullenly stepped aside.\n\nAs if to prove the right of Allied access, Lightner now repeated the process. This time his car was allowed to proceed by the East Germans uninspected. After driving about a mile through East Berlin Lightner returned through the checkpoint, again without difficulty. U.S. determination had carried the day.\n\nOn Monday, however, the GDR reacted with vigor. In a special announcement, the East German news agency (ADN) said that henceforth all “foreigners” wishing to enter East Berlin must show their identification papers to the Volkspolizei on duty. A Communist spokesman later clarified the announcement and said that military officials in uniform would be exempted. But the East German intent was clear. The issue raised by Lightner’s crossing the previous evening had now been joined.\n\nIn Washington, as at the time of the blockade, indecision prevailed. An urgent message from General Watson requesting instructions as to how to handle the East German announcement drew only the laconic comment from the State Department that U.S. citizens should be “advised” to “go slow” on entering East Berlin.\n\nConfronted with an impending collapse in the face of the Communist announcement, General Clay now took charge. Where Watson had merely asked for instructions, Clay went directly to the White House. As in 1948, Clay advised Washington that a failure to meet the Communist threat would have the most serious consequences. Only by forcing the Communists to back down, he said, could Allied prestige be salvaged. Refusal to meet the issue head-on would be interpreted as surrender.\n\nClay’s appeal was successful. As the General later advised the author, “Whenever I carried my case directly to the President, I was supported.” Over the strenuous objections of numerous high level advisers, General Watson was authorized to protest the East German announcement to Soviet authorities and, failing to receive satisfaction, to demonstrate once more U.S. intentions.\n\nWednesday morning, October 25, General Watson delivered his protest to Colonel Solovyev in East Berlin. Shortly afterwards, and as if to indicate Washington’s support, State Department press officer Lincoln White announced that “when General Watson made his protest this morning he had behind him the full authority of the United States Government.”\n\nBut the Soviets were in no mood to back down. Already, in fact, they had discerned a crack in Western ranks. On the day following Lightner’s entry into East Berlin, British diplomats passing through the East German barrier had scrupulously showed their passports to East Berlin officials. Accordingly, General Watson’s protest was denied and American headquarters was told that U.S. officials would have to comply with the East German regulations.\n\nHaving failed in their protest, U.S. officials in Berlin now began a systematic show of force. At 10:30 A.M. an American vehicle with two mission representatives attempted to enter East Berlin. When the Vopos refused to allow the car to pass, twelve U.S. military policemen escorted it through. Forty-five minutes later ten M–48 medium tanks lumbered up to Checkpoint Charlie and took up positions. Twice more that day American cars were escorted through the East Berlin checkpoint by military police. The East Germans, chagrined and humiliated, made no effort to interfere.\n\nBy now the Ulbricht regime was close to panic. The Deputy Defense Minister of the GDR announced in an emergency television broadcast that the “People’s Army” was prepared to crush the American provocateurs. Neues Deutschland said the American action could not be tolerated. Other Communist spokesmen openly threatened war. But the East Germans were bluffing. Their attempt to curtail Allied rights had been turned against them. By vigorously contesting the GDR’s encroachment, Clay was about ready to prove what had been his objective all along. Namely, that it was the Soviets and not the East Germans who were responsible for East Berlin.\n\nThe appearance of U.S. tanks at Checkpoint Charlie came close to doing that. Washington, of course, was now extremely jittery. But so was Moscow. On Thursday evening, October 26, after U.S. military police had forced the barrier twice more, thirty-three Soviet tanks with Russian crews rolled into East Berlin and bivouacked just off the Unter den Linden—less than a mile away. Earlier that afternoon General Clay had told newsmen that the “United States was determined to continue showing force, if necessary, until the issue was resolved with the Soviet Union.”\n\nThe following day, Friday, October 27, the confrontation was achieved. Late in the afternoon, after the U.S. had forced the barrier once more (the East Germans now were thoroughly disgraced), ten of the Soviet tanks from the Unter den Linden rolled down Friedrichstrasse toward the checkpoint. They stopped shortly before reaching it and took up a two-three-three-two position facing the West. Clay’s point was proved, and the four-power status of Greater Berlin was still in effect.\n\nImmediately after the Soviet tanks appeared, General Clay held a press conference at Berlin Command. His manner, though not jubilant, was that of a man whose arguments had been vindicated. Said Clay:\n\nThe fiction that it was the East Germans who were responsible for trying to prevent Allied access to East Berlin is now destroyed.\n\nThe fact that the Soviet tanks appeared on the scene proves that the harassments which were taking place at Friedrichstrasse were not those of the self-styled East German government but ordered by its Soviet masters.\n\nShortly after 10:30 the following morning the Soviet tanks withdrew. The American armor moved back thirty minutes later. The confrontation had lasted sixteen hours. For the first time since 1958, the West had successfully exposed the puppet relationship between Ulbricht and Moscow. A vital Communist argument had been demolished. The East Germans were not a sovereign state and could not be trusted, even by the Kremlin. The Communist gambit of a separate peace treaty with the GDR was thus revealed as meaningless. And once more, when confronted by a show of American determination, the East had backed down. Most important, however, by exposing the inherent weakness of the Ulbricht regime, General Clay had recouped much of the prestige which the West had lost in Berlin on August 13. Popular morale in the Western sectors began to revive, and the tide of Communist encroachment temporarily had been checked.\n\nBut Clay’s victory was not without its drawbacks. As in 1948, the risks seemed to multiply the further one moved from the scene of action. NATO members wondered whether the United States had changed its policy in Berlin.j London regarded the show of force as “foolish posturing over an essentially minor issue.” Official Washington, except perhaps for the President, was beside itself with indignation. The proponents of negotiation charged that Clay had gone to the brink of war. Indeed, as soon as the Soviet tanks appeared, there was anguished hand-wringing even in the Pentagon. Clay was ordered to withdraw the U.S. forces from Checkpoint Charlie as soon as possible.\n\nAs a result of Washington’s timidity, a second Western victory was discarded. No further efforts were made by U.S. officials to force the East German barrier. To all intents and purposes, the GDR had at least won a stand-off in its claim to deny entry to Allied diplomats except upon presentation of their papers. Negotiations over access to East Berlin were transferred to U.S. Ambassador Thompson in Moscow. In the interim, American diplomats were ordered to stay out of the Soviet sector.\n\nThe affair at Checkpoint Charlie marked the height of Clay’s authority in Berlin. As soon as the tanks were withdrawn, senior Administration spokesmen began to decry the way the General had handled the issue. Leaks from Washington describing official “dissatisfaction” over the events at Friedrichstrasse soon turned into a deluge.k But Washington, of course, was completely out of touch with the daily situation in Berlin and could not understand how Clay’s action had been necessary. Had the United States backed away from the confrontation at Checkpoint Charlie, a crisis of morale similar to that which occurred in August would have ensued. In such an event, it is unlikely that our position in Berlin could have been held.\n\nThe British, of course, shared Washington’s view. The day after the tanks had been withdrawn from Checkpoint Charlie, the senior representative of the British Foreign Office in Berlin visited the Soviet sector and assured Russian officials that Clay would soon be recalled.12\n\nThe Administration’s anti-Clay campaign had an immediate effect in Berlin. Less than three days after the visit of the British deputy chief of mission to East Berlin, the Communists once more were on the offensive. Convinced no doubt that Clay was firmly shackled, East German authorities on November 3, detained four separate U.S. Army vehicles in East Berlin for periods varying from 35 to 70 minutes. The day previous, Danish and Norwegian military mission chiefs were denied entrance to East Berlin until they produced their personal passports—thus acknowledging that East Berlin’s occupation status had ended. One day later, two members of the U.S. Mission were detained for twenty minutes while on official business. By seeking to undercut Clay’s prestige, Washington very nearly opened a Pandora’s Box. Fortunately for the West, Clay withstood the assault and continued to operate as though nothing had happened. When the Communists saw that Clay was not leaving, they soon desisted from further encroachments.\n\nThere were other reasons too why Communist pressure subsided. In Moscow, the talks between Ambassador Thompson and the Kremlin were in high gear. The entire package which the Kennedy Administration had prepared on Berlin was being presented. In this situation, there was little reason for the Soviets to apply pressure on the West. With Washington now leading the dash to the conference table, there was good reason for Moscow to believe that its demands in Germany would be met; that regardless of the cruelty of the Wall, the United States was prepared to accept it, along with the Ulbricht regime, as the price for “easing tensions.” And so, as he had done in a similar mood of anticipation two years before at Camp David, Nikita Khrushchev once more called off his East German stooges and modified his ultimatum. Temporarily, Communist pressure would be relaxed.\n\nBut once more Mr. Khrushchev was to be disappointed. As in 1960, the prize he sought was to be denied him. For standing firmly in the path of the Western retreat were the aging figures of Charles De Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer. And though the United States may occupy the leading position in the West, it dare not ratify an accord in Europe unacceptable to its two most resolute Allies.\n\nFor a while, however, the situation hung perilously in the balance. In spite of West European opposition, the United States seemed determined to ram through an agreement with Russia at all costs. During the winter and spring of 1961–62, a negotiated settlement in Berlin became the sine qua non of American policy. Only gradually did this policy yield to the perhaps wiser counsel of our continental Allies.\n\nIn November, as the Thompson-Gromyko talks were beginning, President Kennedy tendered a personal invitation to Dr. Adenauer to visit him, and the meeting was quickly arranged for November 20. The purpose of the meeting, in Washington’s eyes, would be to convince the Chancellor of the American position. As the Administration would have it, Adenauer would be asked by Kennedy what was the alternative to negotiations? In short, Washington hoped to bring pressure on der Alte to support the talks which were then in progress.13\n\nAdenauer, however, had his own reasons for coming to Washington. If the White House was eager for the Chancellor to visit in order to convince him of the necessity for negotiations, Dr. Adenauer was equally eager for the visit in order to stiffen American resolve, for Bonn was deeply troubled at this time about the course that the U.S. was following. The Kennedy Administration, it seems, had lost the confidence of West Germany, and Chancellor Adenauer wanted to explore the differences at first hand.\n\nThe meeting in Washington lasted three days, and when it ended, the President and Dr. Adenauer issued a joint communique. In spite of the communique’s harmonious language, however, the differences remained.l The Chancellor had recognized that he could not stop the Administration from negotiating with the Kremlin. Rather than attempt to, he had insisted that before any overture was made, the Western powers should agree among themselves precisely what their offer would be. This served as a temporary brake on the discussions in Moscow because the Federal Republic certainly was not prepared to accept what Washington was offering.\n\nAlso, Dr. Adenauer, who found his worst suspicions now confirmed, firmly insisted that any discussions with Moscow be limited solely to Berlin. This was a complete turn-about from what Bonn had been saying since 1958, but the atmosphere in Washington had so shaken the Chancellor that he now sought anything to limit the scope of the Moscow talks. If they were confined simply to Berlin, he felt, there would not be quite so much danger of recognizing the Ulbricht regime, or worse, of formally agreeing to Germany’s continued division.\n\nEven on Berlin, however, the position of the Kennedy Administration was extremely upsetting to Adenauer. Not only would the U.S. not agree to make removal of the Wall a condition for negotiation, but now Washington desired to formulate a new agreement with Russia over the isolated city which would supersede the Allies’ right of occupation. According to the State Department, the plan would provide a new “contractual arrangement” for Western rights. To the West Germans, this seemed fearfully close to exchanging war won rights—the true legal basis for the Western position in Berlin—for a bilateral agreement with Russia; an agreement that there was no guarantee the Soviets would honor. The feeling was unmistakable, in fact, that the American proposal was simply a device for loosening Allied ties to Berlin and decreasing the extent of U.S. involvement.\n\nTo slow Washington’s interest in the so-called “new contractual arrangement,” Adenauer mobilized a united front. On the day of the Chancellor’s departure from Washington, Foreign Minister Schroeder told a luncheon group at the National Press Club that it would be extremely dangerous “to renounce the rights vested in the Allies as the result of the miltiary occupation” for an agreement based purely on Russian good faith. Later, from Bonn, Lord Mayor Willy Brandt went even further. Any change in Berlin’s status, Brandt said, would require an amendment to West Germany’s Basic Law; an amendment, he added, which the SPD would never permit to pass.\n\nIn spite of the Chancellor’s determined resistance, however, the Kennedy Administration stuck to its basic position that a negotiated settlement in Berlin could be achieved. Once more the feeling was current that Adenauer, like De Gaulle, was an anachronism on the world scene who would soon be gone. His views were written off accordingly.\n\nLess than a week later, in fact, President Kennedy told Aleksie Adzhubei, Mr. Khrushchev’s son-in-law, that an agreement was still possible in Germany which would “recognize” Germany’s division. According to the President: “Germany today is divided. Germany today is not a threat to the Soviet Union militarily.”\n\nThe important thing is to reach an accord which recognizes the interests of all.… I recognize that there are going to be two Germanies as long as the Soviet Union thinks that that is in her interest. The problem now is to make sure that, in any treaty which the Soviet Union reaches with East Germany, the rights of the other powers are recognized in Berlin.\n\nAs in his UN speech earlier, Mr. Kennedy made no request that the freedom of movement in Berlin be restored. He did not demand that the Wall come down. Except in the past tense, he did not refer to Greater Berlin’s four-power status. Based on the interview, there could be little doubt but that Washington regarded the Wall as permanent.\n\nThe Berliners accepted Kennedy’s position stoically. When the President’s brother visited the city in February, the people turned out in great numbers to see him. Few had any illusions that he was bringing salvation. Robert Kennedy reassured the Berliners that the U.S. would not forsake them. As for the division of the city, however, the Attorney General was more circumspect. The Wall, he said, was tragic, but they should not expect “miracles” that might bring it down.\n\nThe Berliners applauded Kennedy—not because of what he said, but because they felt he had told them the truth. It was an indication perhaps that the morale of the city was no longer on edge. For this, the tribute can go to Lucius Clay. The General had been in Berlin for five months when the President’s brother arrived. His differences with Washington still existed, but his presence had had a tonic effect. In his actions, Clay had carefully avoided giving the Berliners any reason to feel that his disagreements with the Administration were serious. To them, he was the President’s Ambassador acting with the President’s full confidence—as indeed he was. For the general public, the machinations of the anti-Clay axis passed almost unnoticed.\n\nAll the same, however, official Washington continued to worry about the possibility of an incident in Berlin. In mid-December, for example, the State Department furnished a new and detailed set of directives to General Watson supposedly designed to cover any possible contingency. The directives were so complete, in fact, that the Berlin Commander was afforded no discretion whatever. Henceforth, Watson was to clear his actions—even those taken in the face of an obvious emergency—first with USAREUR headquarters in Heidelberg, and then with NATO.\n\nGeneral Clay vigorously protested the directives at the time, calling them a new high water mark in the discretionary limits placed on a tactical commander. Such orders, he said, would make it all but impossible for the local commander to take effective action should the Western sectors be threatened by a sudden incident. But it was this very limitation that Washington wanted. Clay received no satisfaction from his cables and therefore, on January 6, flew to Washington to place the issue directly before the President and Secretary Rusk. Before the General could arrive in Washington, however, news of his coming had been leaked to the press. Clay went through with the trip, saw both Kennedy and Rusk, but returned to Berlin with no additional authority.\n\nShortly after Robert Kennedy’s visit, the Soviets abruptly ended the three-month calm that had prevailed in Berlin and began a series of harassing actions in the Allied air corridors. Exactly why the Kremlin suddenly reversed its tactics is difficult to explain, except in the context of the negotiations which were then in progress. Shortly after Christmas, Ambassador Thompson had presented to the Kremlin a U.S. plan calling for an “international authority” to control access to Berlin. Although the exact composition of the authority was not specified (President Kennedy had suggested such an idea in his interview with Khrushchev’s son-in-law), the United States proposed that such a body be created and given full sovereignty over the means of Allied access to West Berlin. This would include the Helmstedt-Berlin autobahn, the three air corridors, and the airports in West Berlin.\n\nTo a large extent, the American plan was another outgrowth of the Kennedy Administration’s haunting fear of an incident in the isolated city. As Washington saw it, Allied access to West Berlin was dependent entirely on the detailed set of working arrangements which had been developed over the years by the local military commanders. The functioning of this system required constant and direct contact between the Russians and ourselves. There were no buffers in between. Should a misunderstanding occur—even a legitimate misunderstanding—it would be the Soviets and the particular Western power, once more in a dangerous confrontation. To the White House, and to the State Department and the Foreign Office who quickly agreed, the possibility of such a confrontation brought back unhappy memories of Checkpoint Charlie. A lack of caution on either side, as they saw it, could easily escalate into nuclear war. Accordingly, to reduce the possibility of a direct confrontation, the Administration had come up with the idea of an “international authority” to control access. As explained by the State Department, it would be “something like the New York Port Authority,” with representatives from all sides.\n\nTo the Administration’s dismay, however, no sooner had Ambassador Thompson suggested the plan to Moscow than the Russians launched a deliberate campaign to harass Allied air traffic. Responsible opinion in West Berlin saw a direct link between the Russian move and Washington’s proposal. For until Thompson had raised the matter with the Kremlin, the right of Western access always had been considered immutable. By now suggesting changes, Washington was indicating that this was not true. And so to probe Allied determination, the Soviets began to fly their own planes in the air corridors, to buzz commercial airliners, to threaten training flights at the same times and altitudes as Western flights, and to drop radar-jamming metal chaff.\n\nAlso, in addition to probing Western intentions, the Russians perhaps were demonstrating to Washington how easily an incident in the air corridors could arise. Such a demonstration would clearly encourage the Administration’s desire for a new arrangement and thus facilitate the negotiations which were then in progress.\n\nWashington’s reaction to the Soviet harassment certainly gave the Kremlin no cause for alarm. No attempt was made to counter the Russian encroachments although the West did continue to fly its planes on schedule. Indeed, not to have done so would have amounted to a major defeat. By not countering the Russian moves, however, the United States left its intentions in the air corridors somewhat in doubt. General Clay, for example, had recommended the use of fighter escorts to prove Western determination but was turned down. Another possible counter would have been to fly C–130’s into Berlin at altitudes above 10,000 feet. This had been done three years earlier and had brought the Russians quickly to heel. But this also was turned down. As a result, the Russians were allowed to harass Allied air traffic during the months of February and March, completely unopposed. A dangerous precedent was being set. The Russians demonstrated the right to fly in the Western corridors, to challenge Allied aircraft and to interfere with navigation controls. In the event of another blockade, the West would reap a bitter harvest.\n\nDespite the Soviet harassment, Washington now pressed harder than ever for negotiations. The anomaly of meeting with the Russians at the conference table while the Soviet government was doing everything possible to interfere with Allied air traffic into Berlin seems to have made no impression on the Administration. Secretary Rusk went to Geneva for the disarmament conference in mid-March, and beginning on March 11, kept up a daily round of informal consultations with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. In the days immediately preceding the first Rusk-Gromyko chat, however, Soviet harassment in the corridors was at its height. Metal chaff was dropped repeatedly in the air lanes and individual buzzings became the rule rather than the exception.14\n\nSoviet activity in the air corridors stopped as abruptly as it had begun. The cut-off date came on March 29—two days after the final Rusk-Gromyko session in Geneva. Reportedly, Mr. Rusk had advised Gromyko that the Soviet Union could best prove its interest in negotiations over Berlin by leaving the air corridors alone. Rusk’s statement, however, did not represent a new or firm approach by Washington and had, in fact, been told to the Soviets repeatedly since the harassment began. What was significant was that in their final meeting, Rusk and Gromyko had compiled a “position paper” on Berlin listing their various agreements and disagreements. According to reliable reports, the agreements were that West Berlin should be free, viable, and have links to the West. All of which, it should be noted, were phrases that fit neatly into the Soviet idea of a neutralized “free-city.” The disagreements included U.S. insistence on the maintenance of Western troops in West Berlin, the question of access, and the role of the GDR.15\n\nBecause of the far-reaching implications of the “agreements,” however, Gromyko must have felt that he had his foot in the door. Thus, the Soviets willingly curtailed their air corridor harassment content, perhaps, to consolidate their gains. For based on the Rusk accord, the Kremlin now knew positively that the United States no longer was interested in East Berlin. In effect, the United States had formally ratified Ulbricht’s fait accompli.\n\nThe Rusk-Gromyko memorandum marked the opening of a new round of negotiations on Berlin. It also marked the end of General Clay’s tenure in the isolated city. The reasons for Clay’s leaving are obvious. First, the Rusk-Gromyko accord marked a temporary easing of tensions in Berlin. Second, and more important perhaps, the General was extremely dissatisfied with his position in Berlin. It was no secret that he and Washington saw the Berlin problem differently, and the Rusk-Gromyko memorandum represented the culmination of this difference. Where Clay felt that the best way to discourage Communist encroachments was through prompt and effective countermeasures, the Kennedy Administration did not. As a result, his recommendations for a firm stand frequently were turned down. Thus, unable to have an effective voice in U.S. policy, the General perhaps felt he was being used as a cover by Washington to mollify the Berliners—as a front man to shield a policy with which he basically disagreed.\n\nAlso, American insistence on negotiations in the face of continuing Soviet affronts in the air corridors must have galled the General considerably. The implications of the American negotiating package—increased recognition for the GDR, renunciation of German reunification, and recognition of the Oder-Neisse line—were probably equally distasteful. In addition, General Clay has always esteemed the position in which the Berliners hold him; perhaps to some degree he felt he was not being fair to them to continue on. The temporary calm produced by the Rusk-Gromyko talks gave him the opportunity to bow out gracefully.m\n\nIn the following weeks, whenever Clay spoke in Berlin, he referred to the fact that the situation had eased, that West Berlin’s morale had recovered, and that his presence was no longer needed. In the existing situation, he said, he could do more for Berlin’s defense by returning home than by staying on. It is questionable, however, whether the General was giving an accurate picture of the situation or attempting to reassure the Berliners that his leaving was justified.\n\nIndeed, in terms of Western unity, Berlin’s defenses were now in serious disrepair. On April 12, the day following Clay’s departure to see the President, the United States had submitted to each of the major Western powers (France, Britain, and the Federal Republic) its detailed proposals for an accord in Berlin. These proposals were an outgrowth of the Thompson talks in Moscow and the more recent Rusk-Gromyko conversations in Geneva. They were to be used as a basis for a new round of negotiations scheduled to begin in Washington on April 16, when Secretary Rusk met Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. Attached to the U.S. proposals was a curt demand from the State Department requesting approval within twenty-four hours.\n\nSpecifically, the U.S. proposals provided for: (1) the establishment of an “international access authority” to control traffic to Berlin; (2) an exchange of “non-aggression declarations” between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in which each side would pledge not to violate “existing borders or demarcation lines”; (3) a U.S.-Soviet agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons; and (4) the establishment of official bilateral committees between East Germany and the Federal Republic at the governmental level. These committees would deal with trade, communications, cultural exchanges and travel—all of which were matters then handled by the two states on a purely “technical” basis at the lowest level. As Washington saw it, the establishment of these committees would force the Federal Republic into official dealings with the Ulbricht regime, and would encourage the realization in West Germany that the two states would have to work together. There were no provisions for later reunification under the U.S. plan.16\n\nIn Bonn, the arrival of the American “diktat” caused a flurry of reaction. To begin with, responsible West German officials considered the twenty-four-hour deadline requested by Washington to be unreasonable. Although this difficulty did not arise in Paris or London (the French automatically rejected and the British automatically accepted the U.S. plan), the Federal Republic wanted time to give the proposals the mature consideration which they deserved and strongly resented being pressured. Chancellor Adenauer, in fact, was away from Bonn at the time the U.S. proposals arrived and had rushed back to place them before his Cabinet. He requested an extension of the original ultimatum and was reluctantly granted another twenty-four hours.\n\nThe blatant pressure represented by the extremely short time limit was not nearly as upsetting to Bonn, however, as the substance of the American proposals. First, the Federal Republic had doubts about the U.S. access plan. Under Washington’s proposal, access to West Berlin would be entrusted to an international authority, one of whose principal members would be the spurious German Democratic Republic. To Bonn, this seemed dangerously close to entrusting a major degree of political control over Berlin’s access to the Ulbricht regime. Indeed, the inclusion of East Germany in such an “authority,” it was feared, would merely foreshadow a separate Soviet peace treaty with the GDR, the assumption being that the Allies would now have a modus operandi should the Russians choose to do so.17\n\nAlso, the request for joint East-West committees with no provision for eventual reunification seemed to place the Federal Republic in the position of formally recognizing the GDR. The pledge of respect for “existing demarcation lines” between NATO and the Warsaw Pact appeared to be not only an acceptance of the Wall in Berlin but a permanent denial of the right of self-determination to the people of East Germany, and a de jure acceptance of the Oder-Neisse line as well.\n\nEqually important perhaps, in no place had the American proposals referred to East Berlin. This was a significant departure from all previous Western proposals, including even the Geneva low-water mark of 1959. Indeed, to Bonn, three out of the four U.S. proposals dangerously enhanced the position of the East while gaining nothing in return.\n\nWashington’s ultimatum, however, made the Federal Republic’s reply imperative. Pressed for time and thus unable to prepare a set of alternatives—there are many in Bonn who think the time limit was decreed precisely for this purpose—the Federal Republic advised Washington that while it had reservations, it would reluctantly go along with the package. As subsequent events were to reveal, Chancellor Adenauer thought there would be no chance of Russia accepting the proposals and therefore, rather than cast his Government in an obstructionist light, it was decided to go along with the plan. But the key to this position, of course, was that the Soviets would reject the package. To help insure this, Bonn began its own guerrilla campaign against the proposals. Immediately following the Federal Republic’s official reply to Washington, Dr. Heinrich von Brentano, now leader of the CDU’s parliamentary majority, reportedly caused the precise details of the American plan to be leaked to the press. The following day, April 13, both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried front page stories from Bonn describing the exact nature of the U.S. proposals.\n\nThe repercussions were immediate. In the White House, President Kennedy reportedly flew into a finger-pointing rage. Assorted Presidential advisers and the State Department were indignant. West German Ambassador Wilhelm Grewe was summoned to the office of Assistant Secretary of State Foy Kohler and chided in language frequently exceeding the bounds of diplomatic nicety. Rusk himself dispatched a seething cable to German Foreign Minister Schroeder which was so heated in its accusations that Chancellor Adenauer wanted to return it unanswered. According to Washington, the leak in Bonn had made a unified Western position “practically impossible” on the eve of the Dobrynin talks and represented a deliberate attempt “to sabotage East-West negotiations.”18\n\nThe following day, Saturday, April 14, the Bonn government expressed its “deep regrets” over U.S. “irritation” at the leak. The difficulty, according to West German Press Secretary Felix von Eckhardt, was due to “thoughtless” reports written by certain correspondents—thoughtless because of the political consequences aroused.19\n\nIn spite of the leak from Bonn, the Rusk-Dobrynin talks began as scheduled on April 16. The American package proposal was presented, and afterward, Ambassador Dobrynin remarked that the session had been fruitful. Three days later, in a surprise move, the Soviet Union announced that Marshal Ivan Konev was being recalled from East Germany. To informed observers, the evidence seemed clear that the Kremlin was impressed by the American offer and was putting on a new face. The East Berlin newspaper Neues Deutschland, for example, reported that the American plan was “an approach to reality.”\n\nIn West Germany, however, opposition to the U.S. proposals now began to crystalize. For the next several weeks the air was filled with transatlantic sniping as both Bonn and Washington battered away at each other’s position. Chancellor Adenauer—now back in Cadenabbia—began to advise visitors that the Federal Republic had consented to Washington’s proposals confident that Russia would reject them. The State Department issued statement after statement explaining that the Administration’s proposals, and particularly those regarding access, would only give the East Germans “local responsibilities”—responsibilities which Secretary Rusk maintained they already enjoyed.20\n\nOf all the issues that divided Bonn and Washington, however, it was the question of access that was now the most serious. As more and more details of the U.S. plan were revealed, it became increasingly plain that major concessions to the Ulbricht regime were involved. First, the fact that only one autobahn, that between Helmstedt and Berlin, would come under the jurisdiction of the proposed international authority meant that the remaining two autobahns between Berlin and West Germany,n plus all the rail lines and canal routes, would remain under exclusive East German control. Since these other routes carried virtually eighty-five percent of the traffic to Berlin, the American proposal appeared in Bonn not as a way to guarantee West Berlin’s continued viability but merely as a means of reducing U.S. involvement. The Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn, it should be remembered, is the only one used by Allied forces.\n\nThus, to Bonn, the price which Washington was prepared to pay for this limited agreement seemed excessive. The fact that the public had never been explicitly advised that only the routes used by the Western powers would be included under the U.S. plan tended to confirm Bonn’s suspicions. In Washington, the State Department explained the omission on technical grounds. To try to set up international control of rail and canal traffic, they said, would mean creating international “pockets” all over East Germany.21 Presumably, this would also have been true of the other two autobahns. The fact that the United States was prepared to discontinue its military trains into Berlin once the access authority came into existence, however, was extremely disquieting.\n\nAnother West German objection related to the composition of the proposed authority. Under Washington’s latest draft, reportedly developed by President Kennedy himself,22 the authority would be made up of thirteen member states, each possessing one vote. These states would include: for the West—the United States, Great Britain, France, the Federal Republic, and West Berlin; for the Communists—the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and East Berlin; and three neutrals—Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. Since this arrangement would give the Communist bloc parity with the West, the ultimate responsibility for Berlin traffic thus would be shifted to the three neutrals, i.e., to Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. To renounce Allied rights presently guaranteed by the Big Four themselves in favor of an agreement resting in the final analysis on the political courage of three relatively weak neutrals seemed an unhappy bargain. Also, the fact that both West Berlin and West Germany would be included as political equals on the Western side seemed to lend credence to the Communist claim that there was no legal connection between the two—a claim clearly contrary to established fact.\n\nBut the West German misgivings counted for little in Washington. The Rusk-Dobrynin talks continued at the State Department and the Russians evidently felt encouraged by the U.S. proposals. Not only was the pressure on West Berlin now relaxed completely, but Nikita Khrushchev advised Gardner Cowles, in an exclusive Kremlin interview, that he was “cautiously optimistic” of a settlement in Berlin. Since Mr. Khrushchev’s mood was reported by Cowles as “calm, relaxed and confident,” it is unlikely that the Soviet leader felt he was getting a bad bargain.23\n\nBecause of Russia’s new conciliatory attitude, the West German government now became seriously concerned that the U.S. might consummate its deal on Berlin. On April 27, preparatory to the convening of the NATO conference of Foreign Ministers in Athens, Chancellor Adenauer called a top-level policy meeting of his principal foreign policy advisers at Cadenabbia. To Foreign Minister Schroeder, whose public statements were tending to support Washington’s line, the Chancellor conveyed his own feelings in no uncertain terms. Afterward, and despite the fact that Schroeder was going to see Rusk in Athens, Dr. Heinrich von Brentano flew to Washington to restate the West German case. Brentano arrived in the capital on April 29. If Schroeder had unintentionally allowed Washington to believe that Bonn would accept the new arrangement, the former foreign minister pointedly advised otherwise. “It is not reasonable to belittle the differences that do exist,” he said. “The situation is too serious for that, and it would only make the task of East-West negotiations more difficult to gloss them over.”\n\nThere is no reason to believe that Dr. Brentano’s presentation met with success. Before leaving Washington he told reporters in especially guarded terms that while the U.S. and West Germany agreed on “final goals,” they still differed as to “means” and “methods.” In fact, Brentano’s skillful terminology cloaked a rift that was increasing rather than decreasing. The extent of this rift, and of the difference between Washington and Bonn as to “means” and “methods,” was illustrated in Brentano’s luncheon address to the National Press Club. Referring to the Kennedy Administration’s plan for an international access authority, Brentano said that he “and the Federal Government” supported the concept of such an authority, but that questions about its composition and function “are very important and decisive.”\n\nAccording to Brentano, the “original idea” was to have the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union “carry the political responsibility” for access. Acting under them in a “purely technical capacity,” he said, would be an “administrative group” which could include East Germany. That, said Dr. Brentano, was and remains “a good and a sound idea.”24 But it was an idea considerably removed from the thirteen nation authority which Washington was now proposing. Thus, when he returned to Bonn, von Brentano told Adenauer that the United States was still pursuing an illusory settlement and one which West Germany must not accept.\n\nFrom Athens, the Chancellor received similar reports from Dr. Schroeder. Despite the rosy press reports that Secretary Rusk and the West German Foreign Minister had agreed on all substantive issues, it was another case of diplomatic subterfuge. In reality, the “basic agreement” that was reported related only to the idea of an international authority, not to its details. Schroeder, in fact, firmly advised Rusk that the West German Government felt that the U.S. proposal would undermine vital Allied rights in Berlin and would make the situation worse rather than better. French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville added his voice to that of Schroeder’s, remarking that there was no logical reason for continuing the negotiations. Again, however, the French and West German objections were brushed aside.\n\nBut by the beginning of May, the French and West Germans were not alone in questioning the Kennedy Administration’s preoccupation with negotiations. Suddenly finding its tongue, the liberal wing of the Republican Party now began to speak out against concessions in Berlin. In a concerted Senate appearance, three Republican liberals—Ken Keating of New York, Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, and Jake Javits of New York—warned the White House over any deal which would dilute Western rights.\n\n“To enter into negotiations in which the East German government may have some say over access rights to West Berlin would be a bitter renunciation of our position,” said Keating. “No matter what cloak of plausibility may be pulled over this maneuver, it is in essence catastrophic.”\n\nScott and Javits were equally critical. To Scott, the “secrecy” surrounding the Administration’s activities was “lamentable.” It would be fatal, he said, to “bargain away part of, or perhaps ultimately all of, the present free access guaranteed by postwar settlement.” Javits said it was “disquieting” that the Administration “appears to believe that a new agreement on Berlin is the immediate and primary objective of our current policy.”\n\nSeveral days earlier, General Clay himself had expressed similar doubts about the Administration’s access proposals. Appearing on the West Berlin television version of “Meet the Press,” the General was asked whether he shared the German reservations about the inclusion of the Ulbricht regime in the suggested international authority. “I am not happy, of course, at this thought, or this prospect,” Clay replied. “I think that this needs to be carefully discussed and carefully thought out between the Allies and the Federal Republic of Germany, but I don’t think we should condemn it until we know a great deal more about it.”25\n\nAsked whether he thought the United States could avoid recognition of the Ulbricht regime in the course of the negotiations, Clay answered as follows:\n\nI think if you are speaking of diplomatic recognition that this will not be done. When you get into this so-called de facto recognition it is very difficult for me to know at what stage de facto recognition becomes highly objectionable and at what stage it is a fact of life we have to live with.…\n\nI think this is a field in which there must be complete unanimity of thinking among the Allies, where there must be complete discussion.\n\nCertainly it would be self-defeating for the U.S. to adopt any proposal along this line that had not been fully discussed with and accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany. After all, the creation of unity of thought, of economic, of political unity in Western Europe has been a part of our European policy for many, many years.\n\nIf this should fail, if we should lose our friendship of France and the friendship of West Germany because of overtures in these negotiations, it would destroy our entire policy. It would be unthinkable that this would occur.…\n\nThe overall tenor of Clay’s remarks was moderate. There was little question, however, that he had great apprehensions about the U.S. access proposals, and indeed, about the total drift of American policy on Berlin. Clearly, General Lucius D. Clay was glad to be going home. As he explained it to the Berliners, with the Soviet pressure on Berlin temporarily slackened, he now could do more for the city’s defense in the United States. Implicit in Clay’s comment, of course, was the underlying friction with Washington which had hampered his role in Berlin. Perhaps in America, he could bring his weight to bear more fully on Washington.\n\nAs for the existing calm in Berlin, Clay said he thought it would continue, “except for the inevitable tension along the Wall, as long as the talks go on.” “But obviously,” he added, “it is only an interlude.”\n\nShortly afterwards, on May 1, General Clay made his last public appearance in Berlin. The occasion was West Berlin’s traditional May Day celebration in the Platz der Republic—the great amphitheater before the charred ruins of the Reichstag. For the Berliners, they knew that this would be their last chance to see General Clay before he departed. As a result, over 700,000 people—one out of every three persons living in West Berlin—turned out for the occasion. As far as the eye could see, was row after row of people, all standing silently and listening to the speeches.\n\nThe author was in the Platz der Republic that day. The impression is unforgettable. Three-quarters of a million people paying homage to one man, the man who to them personified American determination, who represented American strength, and who symbolized American honor.\n\nThe General, in fact, was not even scheduled to speak. He would just be there on the platform. But the emotional tie that unites Clay and the West Berliners had brought them out to see him. Clay himself was deeply moved. Mayor Brandt quickly sensed the mood of the crowd and asked the General to speak. The people raised a tremendous cheer. Those around us were applauding and weeping simultaneously.\n\nClay did speak. What he said was brief. It was not bitter, but at the same time the words were not the words of victory. It was almost as if the General was warning the Berliners to be watchful:\n\nI am sure that President Kennedy, if he knew that I was speaking to you, [Clay began,] would want me to extend his greetings. I need not remind you of his commitments to you on behalf of our people except to say to you that we live up to our commitments.\n\nI leave Berlin because the time has come when I can serve its cause better at home.… I can, on a moment’s notice, return to Berlin the moment I think I can be of better service here.\n\nSo I shall not now, or ever, say “goodby.” For Berlin is too much a part of me to ever leave. I shall only say, as we say in America, “so long, thank you, and God bless you.”\n\nSince both Chancellor Adenauer and the Bonn government are on record repeatedly against individual nuclear arsenals and, as the President said, since West Germany does not desire a nuclear capacity of its own, the formalization of an agreement between the U.S. and Russia specifically denying such weapons to the Federal Republic would appear to be not only unnecessary but also as though Bonn—one of America’s strongest Allies—was being singled-out for special discriminatory treatment. As former West German Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss once advised Washington, “there can be no second-class allies.”\n\nOfficials here [in Washington] readily concede that responsible officers on the spot must be allowed some leeway to make decisions. But some of them doubt whether the United States Mission acted wisely in “melodramatizing” the incident with fixed bayonets and tanks.\n\nThey point out that it takes only a few minutes to get on the telephone to Washington. In their view … Clay … should have immediately got Washington’s advice on how to proceed.\n\nHaving swallowed the camel … some officials ask, why should the United States now strain at the gnat.…\n\nReference to the “reasonableness” of the Soviet Union was a virtual restatement of the position espoused earlier by De Gaulle. In effect, the Chancellor had agreed to the U.S. continuing its approach to Moscow only “if there is reasonableness on the part of the Soviet Union.”\n\nCertain Presidential advisers, however, saw the situation differently. Seeking to preempt the General’s own announcement, perhaps even to further the idea of Clay’s differences with Washington, or that he was being recalled, the anti-Clay axis caused the news of his resignation to be leaked to the press as soon as Clay departed to see the President. Washington’s action may also have been another attempt to embarrass Clay or to confront him with a fait accompli. Mayor Brandt, for example, had not yet been told of the General’s plans and found it necessary to answer questions about Clay’s leaving based merely on guess work."
