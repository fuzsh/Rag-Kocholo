        "text": "The research study Decolonizing Socialism. Entangled Internationalism (DECOSO) is a transhistorical investigation into practices from the expanded field of the arts situated in the socialist geographies of the global Cold War period in South-Asia, West-Africa, Latin America and East-Europe as alliances between the East and the South that came together in and via German Democratic Republic. The study aims to open up the entangled fabric between the macro-politics of state or party logics with the micro-politics of artistic collaborations or art-related practices as a really existing condition for techno-political friendships or solidarities. DECOSO contributes to unlearning the Cold War dichotomy of type-casting artists (or architects, writers…) from “the East” or “the South” as either dissidents (“the underground artist”) or conformists (“the State artist”). In other words, instead of attempting a historic reconstruction of cases or situations from a state-socialist cold war paradigm, the study situates, first, the historical within uncontinued mutations into contemporary as archival undercurrents, and second, insists to mobilize the micro-political as vectors that urge to move beyond the national towards an entangled internationalism vibrating in the contemporary.\n\nSituated in the field of visual cultures as an expanded field, the cross-cultural and intersectional study uses existing approaches and develops specific decolonial research methods through a set of case studies. Decolonizing here addresses both the historical, i.e., to investigate power relations within socialist modernity itself acted upon practices of micro-political potency and social imaginaires within the expanded arts; and the contemporary, i.e., to consider the research itself as a displacement of problems as well as potentialities from internationalism to globalism, as well as from micro-political practices into a nation-state-funded project. Specifically the latter aspect reasoned the need to create an independent platform within DECOSO that operates under the frame or the name inter∞note."
