        "text": "EAST BERLIN. The beige Mercedes sedan slid out of the night that obscured the Eastern sector of divided Berlin and nosed through the floodlit Invalidenstrasse border checkpoint—past the tank barriers, the barbed wire, the red‐and‐white striped customs poles, stopping at length before the guard post at the exit to the Western sector. An East German police guard checked the East German license plate —IU 27 73—and peered inside the car.\n\nAt the wheel sat a middle‐aged man. dressed in a stylish double‐breasted suit, his wispy blond hair brushed carefully into place. The flashlight moved about the car, picking out its luxurious fittings, coming to rest on three men in the back, their faces betraying their terror. All three were West Berliners who, until half an hour before, had been serving sentences in East German prisons.\n\nIn the 15 years since the Berlin wall went up, how many novels, movies, TV plays and real‐life incidents have centered on scenes similar to this. How easy to imagine what would logically follow: screaming whistles, soldiers with rifles at the ready running up to seal oft the car and foil the escape. On\n\nCraig R. Whitney is The New York Times's correspondent in Bonn. this night of Sept. 24, 1975, nothing of the sort happened.\n\n“Guten Abend, Herr Rechtsanwalt,” the guard said. “Good evening, Counselor.”\n\nWith East Germany's best‐known private lawyer at the wheel, there was no need to check anyone's papers. The Mercedes glided past the guardhouse, into West Berlin.\n\nWolfgang Vogel had brought three more persons out of East German prisons, to freedom.\n\n0\n\nThe more familiar scenes of escape—tunneling% dashes across minefields, gunfire by the Communist guards or their automatic firing devices—are still enacted by the hundreds between the two Germanys. Most of the 5,110 East Germans who fled their country in 1976 avoided this lethal border and got out through southeastern Europe. Of the 169,492 who have escaped since the Berlin wall was built in 1961, only a few made it through tho minefields; 166 are known to have been shot to death or blown up trying to escape. Yet, in total secrecy for years, and half‐openly of late, another kind of escape mechanism has been at work. Functional, businesslike and deniable by both German Governments, it has brought about the release of some 15,000 persons, at a rate of about 1,500 a year—for a cost to the West $300 million (about $50 million, it said, last year alone). “This year,” an American diplomat in Bonn said the other day, “the arrangement is running more smoothly than ever.” And the key to the arrangement is Herr Rechtsanwatt Wolfgang Vogel.\n\nDo quantities or coffee beans, oranges, bananas from Africa, or other scarce items make their sudden appearance in the East German food markets? Then it would not surprise those in the know if political prisoners, without knowing why, had found themselves at border crossing points at Herleshausen and elsewhere, being whisked across to safety. Does rubber, or tractors, or fine Swedish steel the Communists can't buy with nonconvertible East German marks become available in visible amounts to East German managers? Then it's a good bet that some people the West Germans were particularly interested in had gotten out. One specific example was a group of doctors and nurses belonging to the Charite, an East Berlin hospital affiliated with the Evangelical Church of Germany. The group had been caught trying to flee to West Germany. Someone in Bonn interceded. Vogel got them out. He sold them. To the West German Government. With the East German Government's full\n\n0\n\nTaxi drivers generally don't recognize the name of the cinder lane that meanders through the vegetable gardens and orchards of the Friedrichsfelde suburb of East Berlin, but if you ask for “the lawyer's office” they will find the gabled, white stucco house where Wolfgang Vogel conducts his law practice, for there are only about a dozen private lawyers in all of East Germany. In the outer office, the sign on the wall announces with Prussian humor: “Rules. (1) The Boss is always right. (2) If some day the Boss should not be right, rule (1) automatically takes effect.” The Boss, one of the four secretaries says, is on the telephone. The red door to his private study is thick‐looking and upholstered —against bugging? Shortly, the door opens and a friendly‐looking man in a pin‐stripe suit of fine Western cut asks in.\n\nVogel's clothes—the suits pinched at the waist, the good cloth and faultless seams, the button‐down oxford shirts of subdued blue and gray‐green —have become almost his trademark in a country where shapeless Sovietstyle models of cheap double‐knit material fill the state‐owned department stores. Vogel designs his own clothes and has them tailored specially for him in East Berlin. He admits it's a weakness. He does not add that it's also a good cover insuring that he doesn't stand out like a sore thumb on assignments to the West. The study is as elegant as he is: thick Persian rugs on the floor, rows of leather‐bound books, dark wood cabinets, a digital clock.\n\nShooting his cuffs, he sits behind his writing table of antique fruitwood. He is blueeyed, trim for his age (51); his German is courtly and relaxed; he speaks little English and (in a country where every school child learns it) even less Russian., He seems sincerely distressed at having been called a “broker in human flesh” in the articles about the prisoner deals that have lately flitted through the West German press. “Look at this office,” he says. “It's been described as a prince's castle, but it's only a small garden house. I bought it in 1968 for $14,000. All right, there are the rugs and the leather chairs, but I've been in law practice for 20 years! Me, the seller, they call a slave trader. They never call the buyer\n\nBut what, exactly, is his role?\n\n“Sometimes,” he says, “behind a lawyer, there is a government. Or an agency. Who knows?” His eyebrows rise humorously. “Great Britain has never admitted in all her history to having spies. When a government doesn't want to admit its relationship to a defendant, it just sends a lawyer, who comes in without sayine who sent him.”\n\nThe answer is not entirely disingenuous. Some of the people Vogel has bartered for Western consumer goods were Western spies, who were caught in the Eastern zone when the wall closed off the one route of relatively unhindered movement between the two Germanys. But, as be well knows, the great bulk of the thousands of political prisoners in East German jails are not Western intelligence agents but unionists, Socialists who resisted being merged into the Socialist Unity [Communist] Party, Protestant ministers, nurses, army officers, professional escape specialists and assorted\n\n“I prefer to be more open,” Vogel says. “I have never made a secret of the fact that I represent the state as well as the client.”\n\nBut representing the client, he emphasizes, implies “acknowledgment of responsibility to the client.” “You can't just go into a prison and talk to someone and not have any feelings about him. There is a kind of pastoral, priestly quality to the contact that a lawyer has with a prisoner and his family. You have to experience it for yourself.”\n\nAs a boy in a small town in Silesia (his father was a teacher), Vogel dreamed of becoming a priest. He is still a Roman Catholic, although, he says, “not a practicing Catholic anymore.” And he has never been a Communist Party member, though “philosophically, in a sociological sense, I am a Marxist.”\n\nMost of the “clients” whose freedom he negotiated never met him, and many never learn what led to their release, so the personal involvement he speaks of applies more to his practice as criminal lawyer; yet do his words imply compassion for his erring fellow humans as the motivating force of his other, and more shadowy, career?\n\nHe recounts hls second case after he began private practice in 1954. “It was the defense of a prostitute. Her mother was very poor, but she came to me and asked if she could pay the fee in installments. 1 agreed, of course. But a little later she came again with the entire fee, in cash. I said, ‘How did you get this money?’ She told me, ‘I've heard that lawyers don't put their hearts in their work unless they get paid all at once, so I slaughtered all our hens.’ I have never forgotten that.”\n\nStandard lawyers’ fees on $300 million worth of barter business over 10 years would amount to considerably more than the proceeds of a chicken coop—and Vogel has become wealthy, by East German standards. Then is the idealism helped along by its financial returns? Vogel claims he collects fees only when he has to appear in court. If that is true, is it the power and privilege that attract him—the freedom to come and go as he pleases, the Mercedes, the respect that greets him on both sides of the wall?\n\nAt the height of the cold war, East Germany was an international pariah. But the human misery—divided families, failed escape attempts, imprisonments —&bated on so vast a scale by the wall could not be ignored forever, and a handful of private East German lawyers with extraofficial contacts found their services in demand. One of them, Dr, Wolfgang Vogel, knew an East German Cabinet member, the State Prosecutor and Attorney Josef Streit. He also friendly with a West Berlin lawyer named Jtirgen Stange, who was well connected with the West Berlin city government and with the Christian Democratic Party, then in power in Bonn. Their offices had been only five minutes apart; the wall had put an hour and a half between them, but they could still meet.\n\nIn January 1962, the United States Government received letter from Herr Doktor Vogel containing some fascinating (if accurate) information: that the Russians would be willing to exchange Francis Gary Powers, the American who had been shot down in a C.I.A. U‐2 spy plane over Siberia, for Col. Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, the imprisoned Soviet spymaster in New York. The outcome is history: the famous February 1962 swap on the bridge between Potsdam and West Berlin in which the O.S.S. veteran James B. Donovan represented the United States and Vogel was the “lawyer” (picked by the K.G.B.) for the Russian\n\nLater that year, Jurgen Stange told Vogel he had been asked by West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt and by other Social Democrats to sound out any lawyers he might know in East Berlin on the possibility of doing something on the model of the Powers‐Abel swap. Nothing so dramatic, of course, but something to help the thousands of anti‐Communists, religious leaders, labor organizers and Western agents in East Berlin. Vogel went to his friend the Attorney General, Josef Streit. The East Germans were interested, but wanted to approach the problem on a scale going beyond Berlin. They might be willing, Vogel reported, to release large numbers of imprisoned persons for large\n\nThat exceeded Mayor Brandt's resources; the Federal Government had to be brought in. But the Christian Democratic Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, was a Catholic Rhinelander who distrusted all Prussians, on both sides of the Berlin wall. So Stange contacted the politically conservative but superpatriotic publisher Axel Springer. Springer later said that at the end of 1962 he was asked to mediate and find out if Bonn would be willing to obtain the release of prisoners at a standard rate of 40,000 West German marks a head—$10,000 at the then prevailing exchange rate—on condition of absolute called Rainer Barzel, then Minister for All‐German Affairs. Barzel was interested. But, he wanted to know, who was this Vogel, and could he be trusted to make good on what he proposed?\n\nThere was one way of finding out. Bishop Hermann Kunst, the Bonn representative of the Evangelical Church of Germany, had developed secret, officially tolerated channels for transferring money to Protestants in East Germany. One day before Easter of 1963, a church member who had volunteered for the mission stationed himself on the platform of the Friedrichstrasse elevated railroad station in East Berlin. He had eight packets, each containing 40,000 West German marks. Up above him, on the station's vaulted roof, a squadron of Communist guards held machine guns at the ready; more guards, with police dogs, walked up and down the tracks. A prisoner came up the stairs from the street below; the church volunteer handed one of the packets to an East German customs agent standing halfway down the staircase. Seven more times, a prisoner came up; each time, another packet was handed over. Vogel had de\n\nIn October 1963, Barzel was replaced in the ministry by Erich Mende, a conservative Bonn politician who knew Vogel from earlier days—and who, one day in April 1964, received a visit from his old\n\nacquaintance. Vogel had another proposal: 650 prisoners, who could be picked by the West Germans themselves; 40,000 to 50,000 West German marks per head; and no publicity.\n\nMende, according to his own account of the meeting, asked, “Why don't you just amnesty them?”\n\n“No,” Vogel replied, “they have to make good on the damage they have caused the state by their crimes—sabotage, trying to escape, the costs of training them, and so on.”\n\n“I said,” Mende recounts. “that we couldn't agree to pay cash, but we'd see if we could do it with trade, and later Vogel came back and said that would be acceptable.”\n\nMende's ministry drew up a list in consultation with the major West German political parties, the unions and the churches. “Vogel said the deal would be canceled if it leaked out, so we went to the editors of the major newspapers and explained it all, so they wouldn't publish the story.”\n\n“By the national elections of 1965,” Mende said, “we had gotten 4,000 political prisoners out, for 198 million marks’ worth of goods—everything from fertilizer, drugs, coffee, radios to tropical fruit.” The sum amounted to $50 million at the exchange rate then it force. “It was done through church channels, and we made sure the people in East Germany benefited from it. After one of the deals had been made, we'd send someone to the East Berlin food markets to check on whether, say, a shipment of oranges had arrived.“\n\nThat, he explained, was why the West German authorities had chosen barter. “With cash, you wouldn't be able to tell what happened to the money.”\n\nWhile this intra ‐German trade remained secret, Vogel acquired a reputation on a more international plane. He made at least five undercover flights to London before 1969 to work out the deal under which the British swapped three arrested Soviet spies—Gordon Lonsdale, Peter Kroger and Helen Kroger—for British citizens arrested for espionage in Communist cities from Leningrad to Leipzig. He arranged, in 1966, for the release of Alfred Frenzel, a West German Member of Parliament arrested as a military spy, in exchange for a West German journalist imprisoned in Moscow. In 1969, in one of his biggest coups, he arranged to swap Heinz Felfe, a West German intelligence chief who was really an East German Communist agent. for West German agents imprisoned in East Germany and\n\nIn his more routine barter dealings, the rate of 1,500 prisoners a year at which the “business” stabilized after 1964 did not change when the Social Democrats joined in a coalition Government in 1966 or when they took over the Government in the 1969 elections. The current Minister for All ‐ Getman Affairs, Egon Franke, places such importance on the barter deals that he won't even talk about them. But some others do, at least guardedly, providing some indication of how the are made.\n\nTake the case of the boy Uwe Potschke, who was jailed in 1972 for the last of hundreds of attempts to jump the border. At that point, apparently, the East German Government gave up on him. On the morning of Nov. 8, 1972, he was placed in a bus with 40 other prisoners and the bus set off,– going west. After some time, a man got aboard; he said that his name was Jurgen Stange, that he was a West Berlin lawyer, and that they were all being freed. He did not explain, and swore them all to silence.\n\nOr the case of the doctors. In September 1975, the word from Vogel was that the East German authorities were willing to release 300 prisoners, their last batch for the year. But the usual rate—which by then amounted to $16,000 a head, because of a decline in the dollar's exchange value—would not suffice, since the group contained many doctors it had cost the Government $60.000 a head to train. Franke approved a higher figure and sent a check to Bishop Kunst. That elderly clergyman sent a subordinate to the Ministry of Trade in East Berlin for the Communists’ shopping list. Bishop Kunst paid the bills, the prisoners turned up at the border crossing point at Herleshausen, and the food items on the list turned up shortly in the East Berlin markets off\n\nVogel's usefulness has occasionally gone beyond barter and swap. For example, when West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt decided 1975 to arrange a meeting with the East German leader Erich Honecker, he didn't through the ponderous diplomatic channels that were set up between the two Germanys in 1974. Schmidt invited Vogel to his vacation home on the Brahmsee Lake, near Hamburg; and, in July, Chancellor and Politburo chairman had two private meetings during the European Security Conference held in Helsinki. How much Vogel's talents are appreciated by his own Government is suggested by the award of the Meritorious Service Medal in Gold made to him by Honecker on Oct. 30, 1975. his 50th birthday. The citation was for “extraordinary service in the founding and development of the Socialist social order, and the strengthening of the German Democratic\n\nThe years have also brought him a lakeside country house, the fancy car in which he commutes the 31 miles to Berlin, a beautiful young wife, and a pleasant existence—skiing in the winter, waterskiing in the summer, collecting antique watches. (“It's a calming sort of hobby. A watch is witness to many lives.”) Yet to his West German, American and other Western contacts, the root motivation of Vogel's strange career remains something of a puzzle. It cannot, says Jurgen Stange, be only a taste for comfort and privilege. Almost every talented lawyer who could get out left East Germany in the 1950's, and with his abilities Vogel could certainly have risen to enormous wealth and power in the corporate board rooms of West Germany. Nor, Stange says, can Vogel be considered to be “some kind of secret ally or sympathizer of the West. He is trying to represent his principal client, the German Democratic Republic, the very best way he can, and he likes perfection in the law, just as he does in his clothes.” Bishop Kunst says: “1 consider Wolfgang Vogel to be a man who has the full confidence of his Government, and a man whom I could never accuse of being in it solely for the\n\nThere is something deeper, evident perhaps in the religious strain woven through his life and his career. He had his daughter by his first marriage confirmed in the Roman Catholic faith in 1964 in a ceremony in the Eastern sector presided over by the Archbishop of Berlin, Cardinal Bengsch. (The girl's godfather, incidentally, is an American diplomat who met Vogel when the latter helped get several Americans out of jail in East Berlin in the early 1960's— another highly unusual friendship for one in the good graces of a Communist regime.) At the confirmation, the archbishop delivered a ringing call for practice of the faith in an atheistic soA friend at the ceremony remembers someone whispering: “This will be the end of Wolfgang's career.” But it didn't seem to harm it. Has his outlook been affected by his own experience of uprootedness and helplessness before the power of government? (The Vogels, along with millions of Germans, were driven out of Silesia when the World War II allies awarded it to Poland.) Whatever the elements of his motivation, they combine into something that makes you believe him when he says with some feeling: “What we are doing brings a tangible, real result—freedom—to people who were moldering in jail\n\nHow long he will be able to continue doing it is a question. “If the serious Western press continues to write about it as ‘trade in human flesh,'” he says, “I wouldn't be surprised if one day the Government here said, ‘All right, that's the end of it.'’ Yet in the present political atmosphere—with officials on all sides paying lip service to détente, the Communist governments pledged to liberalization by the accords they signed in Helsinki, and the nobility of paying any price to rescue any German less clear‐cut than it once was—the West German press is no longer so ready to be silent about prisoner exchanges. As Erich Mende put it: “When we began this, the situation was completely different. There were no relations between the two German states, people were suffering over there, it was the cold war. After Helsinki, to go on with this is to condone a sort of modern■\n\nVogel.
