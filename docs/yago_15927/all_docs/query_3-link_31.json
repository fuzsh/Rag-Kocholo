He’s the same age as Kim Kardashian – and Jenner is US$155 million richer than him\n\nSTORYFaye Bradley\n\nMar 31 , 2024\n\nMight we see Prince Harry making an appearance on The Kardashians sometime soon as part of his new Cali lifestyle?\n\nPerhaps not, but he’s clearly begun mingling with members of American’s biggest reality TV family. According to British media, Meghan Markle’s husband went skiing in Colorado with Kris Jenner’s boyfriend Corey Gamble in mid March. Harry can be seen hitting the slopes with Gamble, Bumble dating app billionaire Whitney Wolfe and her husband Michael Herd in a series of snaps taken in Aspen.\n\nGamble might be best known for his links to the famous Kardashian family, but he has built a name for himself outside the clan too. Here’s everything we know about him:\n\nWhat does Corey Gamble do for a job?\n\nCorey Gamble is a business executive who doesn’t just have the Kardashians on speed dial. He used to be Justin Bieber’s tour manager, working under legendary music executive Scooter Braun.\n\nWhat is the age gap between Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble?\n\nGamble and Jenner have a 25-year age gap. The Atlanta, Georgia native is 43 years old and was born just a month after 68-year-old Jenner’s daughter, Kim. He reportedly dated Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan before Jenner and has no children.\n\nHow did Corey Gamble meet Kris Jenner?\n\nJenner and Gamble met at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci’s 40th birthday party in Ibiza (thrown by Ye) back in 2014. They went Instagram official in 2015 after sharing a post of their double date with Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus.\n\nHe’s very secretive about his family\n\nBack when Kanye “Ye” West was still with Kim Kardashian, the rapper expressed his concerns over Gamble and how they’d never met his family, per People. “Kanye texts Corey something along the lines of, ‘Look, we don’t know you, we’ve never met any of your family members’,” explained Kim during season 16 of KUWTK. “Of course, we’ve all felt that way and thought that, but for Kanye to just so bluntly say that to him – I feel like that was the wrong choice to make at that time.”\n\nKhloé replied, “Kanye’s delivery wasn’t great, but the essence of what he said is true. Corey does tend to be pretty secretive and that does have me pretty guarded … We don’t know Corey like that.”\n\nBut it seems they’ve since been trying to get to know him better. “After my mom got her divorce, I was like, ‘OK, this probably isn’t going to last’,” Khloé said. “I just didn’t feel the need to get that connected or attached. Then when I saw time progressing and the relationship was still there, we tried to get to know him, but he has not been receptive in this whole thing.”\n\nHe has a lavish lifestyle – and plenty of A-list pals\n\nBesides reportedly hanging out with Prince Harry, Gamble has plenty more A-list friends in his inner circle. From Drake and Jay-Z, to Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin, entrepreneur David Grutman and Tommy Hilfiger, he isn’t afraid to flaunt his lavish lifestyle alongside other celebs on his socials. He also goes on romantic trips with his girlfriend Jenner, jet-setting to St. Tropez in the French Riviera and heading to California’s Napa Valley for his 39th birthday, as reported by People.\n\nTheir net worths, compared\n\nJenner and Gamble both have impressive net worths, no doubt, but The Kardashian matriarch comes in with a much stronger fortune than her beau. As previously reported, his current bank balance stands at about US$15 million, which is eye-watering in itself, but a drop in the ocean compared to Jenner’s whopping US$170 million net worth – that’s a US$155 million difference. But hey, if you’re in love, what does money matter right?\n\nMeghan Markle’s husband Prince Harry was spotted skiing in Colorado with Kris Jenner’s boyfriend Corey Gamble in mid March along with Bumble dating app billionaire Whitney Wolfe\n\nGamble might be best known for his links to the Kardashian family, but he has built a name for himself outside the clan as a successful music executive – here’s everything we know about him"
