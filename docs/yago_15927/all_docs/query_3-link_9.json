        "text": "For Kris Jenner, she and longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble make for a timeless pair.\n\nThe 68-year-old media personality and Kardashian matriarch reflected on the 25-year-age gap in her relationship with Gamble, 43, during Wednesday's episode of \"The Kardashians.\" The couple was seen enjoying a romantic dinner in front of the Eiffel Tower as the lovebirds visited Paris, France, to attend a Paris Fashion Week show featuring Jenner's daughter Kendall Jenner.\n\n\"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like, why do you want to date somebody older than you?\" Jenner said in a video confessional. \"I didn't get the age gap, and then he taught me that age is just a number. A (expletive) big number, but it's a number.\"\n\n'Life is so short and precious': Kris Jenner mourns loss of 'beautiful' sister Karen Houghton\n\nJenner, who was previously married to Caitlyn Jenner, began dating Gamble in August 2014 after the two met at a birthday party for fashion designer Riccardo Tisci, according to People magazine. Gamble was serving as tour manager for popstar Justin Bieber at the time.\n\nGamble joined the cast of Jenner's family reality-show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" during Season 10 in 2015 and made several appearances through the series’ conclusion in 2021.\n\n\"Listen, I can’t explain someone's chemistry or why people fall in love,” Jenner said of her relationship with Gamble. \"But it's been an amazing almost 10 years, and we have a great time.\"\n\nKris Jenner: Media personality calls affair during Robert Kardashian marriage 'my life's biggest regret'\n\nIn a March 2021 interview with WSJ Magazine, Jenner opened up about Gamble's impact on her personal life.\n\n\"He’s the greatest guy, and he’s just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight,\" Jenner said at the time. \"He’s a great sounding board. And he loves my kids and my mom, and they love him.\""
