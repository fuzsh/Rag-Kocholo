        "text": "Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet have been one of Hollywood’s most secretive couples to date.\n\nThough romantic rumors began plaguing the two in April, the cosmetics mogul and the actor did not make a known public appearance together until September. Still, multiple reputable outlets have reported on the duo’s relationship, with some describing it as “casual” but also “new and exciting.”\n\nAhead, see everything we know.\n\nDespite breakup rumors, the couple is seen looking smitten together in their first joint appearance in months. Paparazzi snap photos of them en route to the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nFor the low-key outing, Jenner wears a white tub top with baggy black low-waist pants, black flip-flops, a camo trucker hat, and a black leather tote bag. As for Chalamet, the actor wears a black long-sleeve top, black shorts, a black baseball hat, and black Nike sneakers.\n\nA source tells People that the couple headed out to dinner with friends at Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi in New York City, adding that Chalamet in particular was “really chill and so nice.”\n\nAnother source tells the outlet that Jenner and Chalamet are “definitely beyond the ‘just having fun’ point of the relationship” and “everyone on both sides sees definite potential for something real.” They add, “They’re both real with each other and things have been easy and fun. Timothée reminds Kylie to live in a very ‘present’ way, and she really likes that about him. They both push each other to be better people and that’s a constant thing in their relationship.”\n\nMarch 7, 2024: Kylie coyly responds to theories on Timothée influencing her style.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Jenner responds to public speculation that Chalamet inspired her noticeable shift in personal style over the past year, in which she moved from spicy, ultra-sexy pieces to refined minimalist attire.\n\n“I don’t know how I feel about that,” she says. “I just don’t want to talk about personal things.”\n\nShe confirms that she did experience a style transformation one year ago—around the same time her son, Aire, celebrated his first birthday. “It takes me a while after I have a baby to feel like myself again,” she explains. “Then you get your body back, and you’re like, ‘Wait, the trends have changed.’”\n\nJanuary 7, 2024: Kylie and Timothée make their Golden Globes debut.\n\nThe couple arrive at the 81st Golden Globes, and while they skip walking the red carpet together, they are seen showing off their love at the ceremony—and in coordinating sparkly black ensembles, at that.\n\nClips show the pair chatting, laughing, and even sharing sweet kisses during the show. See here:\n\nDecember 24, 2023: Timothée seemingly attended Kylie’s Christmas Eve bash.\n\nFans made a commotion when they spotted a man who appeared to be Chalamet chatting with Jenner at her family’s Christmas Eve party in the background of a Snapchat story posted by Landon Barker. The pic was reposted to a Jenner-Chalamet Instagram fan account.\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Chalamet is asked what his favorite concert of the year was, but has trouble remembering if he attended any concerts in 2023. “You went to Beyoncé. That is documented, I will say,” interviewer Josh Horowitz tells him. “Oh, yes, yes, yes. That was great, that was great,” Chalamet says, blushing. “Hard to be present,” he then jokes, seemingly alluding to his viral, very public makeout session with Jenner.\n\nDecember 10, 2023: Kylie sneaks into Timothée's movie premiere.\n\nAt the Los Angeles premiere of Wonka, Chalamet's latest film, Jenner and her mom, Kris Jenner, skip the red carpet and sneak into the Regency Village Theatre after the film's opening credits, according to a source for People.\n\n“Kylie and Timothée have been doing really well,” another insider tells Entertainment Tonight. “Even though Kylie has so many of her own commitments, she is very proud of Timothée and wants to be there for him and support him,” the source adds. “Timothée is equally supportive of Kylie and admires her strong work ethic and how committed she is as a mom.”\n\nThe source adds, “They both make an effort to show up for each other, and it’s very sweet.”\n\nDecember 4, 2023: Kylie calls Timothée “her boyfriend.”\n\nA source for People reveals the current relationship status between Jenner and Chalamet, saying the mom of two reportedly now calls the actor “her boyfriend.”\n\nThe “incredibly happy” couple are both “supportive” of each other’s careers, the insider explains to the outlet. “They both try to attend important events for each other.”\n\nIn particular, Chalamet is “in awe of everything she is accomplishing” and “especially thinks she is an amazing mom.”\n\n“He is very good for Kylie,” the source continues. “Since dating him, she seems very content, relaxed, and focused. Her family loves him.”\n\nNovember 11, 1023: Kylie supports Timothée as he hosts SNL.\n\nChalamet hosts Saturday Night Live for the second time, breaking the internet with the “baby face” rap portion of his monologue. He and Jenner attend the SNL after-party together. The makeup mogul looks striking in an asymmetrical black minidress, shiny black tights, heels, and shade. Chalamet, meanwhile, is cool in a colorful blue and red hoodie, purple jacket, gray jeans, black sneakers, and a black baseball hat.\n\nNovember 1, 2023: Timothée supports Kylie at the 2023 Innovator Awards.\n\nThe actor shows up at New York City’s Museum of Modern Art to support Jenner, who is being honored at WSJ. Magazine’s 2023 Innovator Awards. The two coordinate in sleek dark looks and are photographed smiling and happily chatting while sitting together during the dinner.\n\nIn an interview with , Chalamet speaks about his wish to lead a private life while continuing to have a career in Hollywood and date one of the most famous women on the planet. At one point, GQ’s Daniel Riley jokingly tells Chalamet that if he really wanted to be left alone, he would not necessarily choose to spend time with one of the four most-followed people on Instagram. At that, the actor laughs and says, “This reminds me of that recent South Park episode with the Worldwide Privacy Tour.” The episode parodies Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, with the couple traveling around the world demanding privacy. “Sometimes, people are going to be hella confused when you say you’re trying to live a private life.”\n\nChalamet adds that despite his fame, he works hard to protect his humanity and stay grounded. “You’ve got to have the experiences in your personal life that are usable to you,” he says. “The experiential rush of my career taking off was so new to me that those were the experiences that were feeding my work for a while. But you’ve got to have real experiences. Human experiences. You’ve got to fall in love, you’ve got to be bored.”\n\nSeptember 25, 2023: Kylie and Timothée step out in Paris.\n\nThe pair is seen out in Paris for Fashion Week.

But friends are whispering that Kylie got dumped.”\n\nThe source adds, “Kylie is playing it casual, but her friends know this must sting. Timothée was the first guy she really spent time with after splitting from Travis [Scott]. She even introduced him to her family.”\n\nHowever, sources for TMZ speak out against the rumors.\n\nThe outlet notes that, though the couple have yet to make a public appearance together, “everything is cool between the two [and] they're still an item.” One insider says, “Any reports that say otherwise are false,” and further warned fans “not to believe everything they read.”\n\nJune 1, 2023: They’re pictured spending time together.\n\nJenner and Chalamet are photographed together for the first time at the actor’s home in Beverly Hills. In photos published by the Daily Mail from two separate days, the pair is seen walking side by side while holding hot drinks.\n\nSources tell the outlet that Jenner has been spending plenty of time at Chalamet’s house—“for upwards of six days a week.”\n\nMay 2023: They’re reportedly keeping it casual and low-key.\n\nJenner and Chalamet are reportedly enjoying a casual relationship away from the spotlight. A source tells Entertainment Tonight on that the two are “casually seeing each other” and that they’ve been “trying to keep it low-key.” Meanwhile, a People insider adds that Jenner is still prioritizing parenting above all else. “Kylie enjoys dating, but her main focus is being a mom. [Their relationship is] not serious,” the insider adds.\n\n“They are becoming more comfortable with each other, but Kylie wants to take things day by day and see where it goes,” says the ET source. “Her family thinks it’s great that Kylie is doing her thing and they are supportive.”\n\n“Timothée loves that Kylie is such a hands-on mom and a boss,” the insider continues. “He appreciates her confidence and thinks she’s incredibly beautiful.”\n\nThe source adds that Jenner’s ex, Travis Scott, hasn’t been happy with the new relationship but is putting co-parenting first. “Travis is not thrilled about Kylie moving on, but they are still cordial and focused on co-parenting and being the best parents they can be.”\n\nApril 17, 2023: Dating Timothée feels “different than [Kylie’s] past relationships.”\n\nAn insider for Entertainment Tonight reveals that Jenner’s romance with Chalamet is “new and exciting.”\n\n“They are keeping things casual at this point.

(Chalamet’s home is about an hour away from Jenner'’s lavish Holmby Hills estate, per the outlet.)\n\nThere have also been reports that the pair had a low-key date night at Tito’s Tacos in Santa Monica a week before Jenner’s Range Rover was spotted at Chalamet’s house. Per DailyMail.com, Chalamet was seen getting into another of Jenner’s cars, with his own following behind as they reportedly drove to the L.A. taco stand and ate in the back seat.\n\nThat same week, a source later confirmed to People that the pair “are hanging out and getting to know each other.”\n\nAnother insider told Us Weekly that the rumored couple are still in the early stages of their romance. “Kylie has only hung out with Timothée a couple of times, so things aren’t that serious. However, she’s enjoying getting to know him better and is open to seeing where things go,” the source told the outlet. “Things are very new so it’s hard to tell, but so far she likes what she sees.”\n\nThe insider added, “Timothée is a total gentleman and treats [Kylie] with respect. He’s very charming and he makes her laugh, and he’s easy to talk to. He’s not like any of the other guys she’s dated before and although he may not seem like her type, they have really good chemistry.”\n\nJanuary 2023: Kylie and Timothée reportedly meet for the first time.\n\nThe two met in-person for the first time when they attended the same Jean Paul Gaultier fashion show in January during Paris Couture Week.

The two began dating in 2017 and share two children: daughter Stormi, five, and son Aire Webster, one.\n\nMeanwhile, Don’t Look Up star Chalamet was previously linked to actresses Eiza González, Lily-Rose Depp, and Lourdes Leon."
