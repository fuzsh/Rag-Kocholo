And the man by Kris’ side is Corey Gamble.\n\nWhen KUWTK viewers first met Kris Jenner, she was married to Bruce Jenner. Prior to the show, Kris had four children with late attorney Robert Kardashian and later welcomed Kendall and Kylie Jenner to the world with Bruce. Her relationship with Bruce played out on KUWTK but nowadays, The Kardashians viewers are used to seeing Kris with her beau, Corey Gamble. So, is Kris Jenner married to Corey? Let’s find out more…\n\nKris Jenner and Corey Gamble’s relationship explored\n\nThrowing it back to 2014, Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble met in Ibiza at Riccardo Tisci’s 40th birthday party according to Cosmopolitan.\n\nIn 2015, Corey appeared on KUWTK for the first time and the two went IG official which showed the world that they were an item.\n\nSince then, it appears to have been plain sailing for Kris and Corey.
