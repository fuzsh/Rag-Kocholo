        "text": "Kris Jenner has opened up about plans for her third wedding - and says she has even chosen bridesmaids.\n\nThe Kardashian matriarch has been dating Corey Gamble for almost 10 years after meeting in 2014. Now the 68-year-old has opened up about plans to wed the music manager, 43.\n\nIt seems Kris, who was married to the late Robert Kardashian first, then Caitlyn Jenner, is in no big rush. On a shopping trip with her best pals Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick, she briefed them on some important news about her upcoming hysterectomy. Kathy, thinking the update was about something else, said: \"I thought you were going to tell me you're getting married.\"\n\nKris replied: \"I mean, not right this very second!\" Kathy then joked: \"I thought you were gonna say six in the morning. I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...'\"\n\nKris then surprised her pals as she completed Kathy's sentence: \"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid. I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nThe mum-of-six shared her wedding update on the July 11 episode of The Kardashians when she went on a shopping trip with her pals.\n\nMeanwhile Kris Jenner has opened up about her concerns over her romance with her younger boyfriend Corey Gamble.\n\nThe couple, who met back in August 2014, quickly became an item as they were spotted on various dates across California and Las Vegas. However, Kris' daughters expressed their concerns about the relationship due to the significant age gap, with Khloe Kardashian even calling it \"creepy\".\n\nNow Kris, 68, has admitted she questioned the 25-year age gap herself in the early days of dating 43-year-old Corey. On the latest episode of The Kardashians, she told the cameras: \"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like, 'Why do you want to date somebody older than you?' I didn't get the age gap.\"\n\nCorey, however, reassured his partner, leading Kris to share in a confessional: \"He taught me that age is just a number. F****** big number, but it's a number.\"\n\nShe added: \"Listen, I can't explain someone's chemistry or why people fall in love, but it's been an amazing almost 10 years and we have a great time.\" Kris and Corey also celebrated their relationship in Paris, where they had travelled to support Kendall Jenner as she walked the runways at Paris Fashion Week.\n\nCorey had planned something very romantic as he took Kris for some cocktails in a rooftop bar overlooking the iconic Eiffel Tower. During a heartfelt moment, Kris shared: \"I love being in Paris with Corey because Corey and I started dating in Paris."
