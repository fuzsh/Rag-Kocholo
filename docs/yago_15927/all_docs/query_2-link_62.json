        "text": "The Kardashian-Jenner clan is in no hurry to walk down the aisle.\n\nKris Jenner said that she and her daughters Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian “have no marriage plans — yet” while attending the AmfAR Palm Beach fundraiser with her other half, Corey Gamble.\n\n“All of us are having fun,” the family matriarch, who has been dating Gamble since 2014, told People at the Foundation for AIDS Research event Saturday.\n\nKris — who was married to Robert Kardashian Sr. and Caitlyn Jenner before meeting Gamble, 43 — previously said something similar despite sparking engagement rumors last year.\n\n“You know you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” the 68-year-old told Laura Wasser on her “Divorce Sucks!” podcast in 2018.\n\nThe “Kardashians” star was first married to Robert Sr. from 1978 to 1991 and the duo welcomed daughters Kourtney Kardashian, 44, Kim, 43, and Khloé Kardashian, 39, and son Rob Kardashian, 36.\n\nAfter splitting from the famed lawyer, she married Caitlyn — formerly known as Bruce Jenner — and they Kendall, 28, and Kylie Jenner, 26.\n\nFor more Page Six reality TV updates …\n\nListen to our “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nAlthough Kendall has no plans to get married any time soon, the 818 founder is reportedly dating her ex Devin Booker, whom she initially dated from 2020 to 2022.\n\nPer TMZ, Kendall and the Phoenix Suns star have been hanging out together but are taking their romance slow.\n\nThe model’s rekindled romance comes two months after she called it quits from Bad Bunny in December 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim is rumored to be dating Odell Beckham Jr. with an insider telling Page Six they “have been hanging out casually” since September 2023.\n\nThe reality star and the NFL player, 31, seemingly confirmed their romance last month when they were spotted walking through Las Vegas’ Wynn Hotel after attending a pre-Super Bowl party.\n\nHowever, the SKIMS founder — who has been married three times — isn’t in a rush to tie the knot anytime soon until she finds someone who understands her lifestyle.\n\n“There’ll be moods where I’m just like, ‘You know what? I understand my life is really big and I understand it takes a really, really, really special, unique person to want to deal with that,” she told James Corden on his “This Life of Mine” podcast in February.\n\n“I think my life is really fun and whoever comes in my life will have a really good time, but it’s a lot.”\n\nKim shares North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4 with her ex-husband Kanye West, whom she was married to from 2014 to 2022."
