        "text": "Kris Jenner has hinted she might get married when she turns 70 next year.\n\nThe Kardashian/Jenner matriarch, 68, has previously insisted she is in no rush to walk down the aisle again with longtime partner Corey Gamble, 43, having been married twice before to the late Robert Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner, 74.\n\nWhen sharing the news that she was undergoing a hysterectomy after an ovarian cancer scare with her close friends Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick, she suggested she could wed again.\n\nWhen she shared the health update on Thursday's (11.07.24) 'The Kardashians', Kathy said: \"I thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married!\"\n\nKris laughed: \"I mean, not right this very second!\"\n\nKathy quipped: \"I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...'\"\n\nKris, who has been with Corey since 2014, then said the pair would be her bridesmaids if the day ever comes.\n\nShe said: \"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid.\n\n\"I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nThe momager turns 70 on November 5 2025.\n\nOn a recent episode of the Hulu show, Kris admitted she questioned the 25-year age gap between herself and Corey.\n\nShe was initially confused as to why he would want to date a mature woman, but she came to the conclusion that you cannot \"explain why people fall in love\".\n\nSpeaking on a confessional, she said: \"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like why do you want to date somebody who is older than you?\n\n\"I didn't get the age gap, and then he taught me that age is just a number. It's a f****** big number, but it's a number!\"\n\nShe continued: \"Listen, I can’t explain someone's chemistry or why people fall in love, but it's been an amazing almost 10 years, and we have a great time.\"\n\nAsked if she or daughters Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian have any plans to marry, she told People magazine: \"All of us are having fun, and we have no marriage plans — yet.\"\n\nKris' comments came after she previously explained that having done \"the big wedding\", she didn't feel the need to walk down the aisle another time.\n\nSpeaking on the 'Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser' podcast, she said: \"You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past.\n\n\"I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up.\n\n“I don't have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I've done that.\n\n“I've had the big wedding; I've had the babies and the kids… I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I'm looking forward to my future and I just don't think that I want to go there.\""
