She said: \"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like why do you want to date somebody who is older than you?\n\n\"I didn't get the age gap, and then he taught me that age is just a number. It's a f**king big number, but it's a number!\"\n\nKris also spoke about their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE last year, explaining he’s helped her in her career.\n\nShe said: “I think Corey is super. He's an amazing guy. He's really supportive and he's really dialled into a lot of the different things.\n\n\"He's very knowledgeable about a lot of the things that I work on, and he really helps me in trying to think through some of the decisions I make. He's such a great person to bounce things off of.

He has built up an incredible fortune, reportedly with a net worth of $3 million (£2.5m).\n\nCorey lives with Kris in Beverly Hills and regularly appears on The Kardashians.
