        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner posted some harsh words on social media following O.J. Simpson’s death on Thursday.\n\n“Good Riddance #OJSimpson,” Jenner posted on X/Twitter shortly after news of Simpson’s death at 76 broke.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was previously married to Kris Jenner, the ex-wife of Robert Kardashian — who was Simpson’s defense attorney. Kris Jenner and Kardashian had four children, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian; Caitlyn and Kris share two children, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.\n\nKardashian and Simpson were close friends from their days at USC, and Simpson was the best man at Kardashian and Kris Jenner’s wedding. Kardashian later represented Simpson during his infamous murder trial for the death of his ex-wife and her friend. To avoid the media, Simpson stayed at Kardashian’s house, and the lawyer at one point was seen transporting a bag that prosecutors believed may have contained evidence. Simpson was later acquitted of the crimes.\n\nOn June 12, 1994, Simpson’s ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were found murdered outside her Brentwood condo. Simpson, who had pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Nicole Brown Simpson when they were married, was considered a person of interest in the killings and charges were filed against him. Instead of turning himself in, a media spectacle erupted when he attempted to flee in his white Ford Bronco and the police followed in a slow-speed chase. The televised chase on June 17 drew an audience of some 95 million people.\n\nThe ensuing trial became a media circus and Simpson was found not guilty for the two murders. But in 1997, Goldman’s family brought a civil suit against Simpson, and he was found liable for wrongful death and battery against Goldman and battery against Nicole Brown Simpson. He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.\n\nSocial media erupted after news broke of Simpson’s death, with many memes shared about the former NFL legend-turned-actor’s murder trial."
