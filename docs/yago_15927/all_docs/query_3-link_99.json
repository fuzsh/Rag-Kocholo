        "text": "Who: The late father of the Kardashian sisters and ex-husband of Kris Jenner\n\nKnown for: Being an American attorney, famously known for defending O.J. Simpson in his 1995 murder trial. Although he won the case for his client, it is till to his day one of the most controversial verdicts in American history.\n\nBefore being put in the spotlight over the O.J. Simpson case, Robert Kardashian was married to Kris Kardashian (now, Jenner), with whom he had four children - Kim, Kourtney, Khloé and Robert Jr - the couple divorced in 1991, three years before the trial actually happened.\n\nRobert Kardashian passed away in 2003, weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.\n\nWho: Kris and Bruce Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Robert Kardashian Jr, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.\n\nWhat: Happily remarried in 1991, Kris Jenner's life sounded like the plot of Cheaper by the Dozen. She had four children and so did Bruce Jenner, who had shot to fame as an Olympic athlete. The couple welcomed together two more baby girls, Kendall and Kylie.\n\nDuring the Noughties, the second oldest Kardashian sister, Kim, began appearing in gossip magazines; after making friends with Paris Hilton, and dating singer Ray J. In 2007, the Kardashian-Jenners scored their own reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians , which is still airing to this day. Bruce's children from his previous marriage, Brody, Brandon and Burt were not featured in most of the seasons.\n\nLet's break down the members of the family individually, shall we?\n\nWho: The momager, the matriarch of the family. The mother of all the Kar-Jenners.\n\nKnown for: Being the mastermind behind the Kardashian family's success and a #ProudMomager. Meet the woman that made this all possible, Kris Jenner. Now you know that she married and divorced Robert Kardashian, and then remarried Bruce Jenner, with whom she had Kendall and Kylie. But what next?\n\nDuring her marriage to Bruce Jenner, Kris managed the careers of all her children, ALL six of them. But her relationship with Bruce ended in December 2014, when the couple were officially divorced.\n\nKris then dated Corey Gamble for two years. Corey, who appeared on the family's show, was very close to the Kardashians, especially Kourtney and her kids. Fans of the show were saddened by the news of their breakup last year but they now seem to be back together.\n\nAKA: Bruce, now, Caitlyn\n\nKnown for: Being an Olympian for the United States, his transgender story and his new life under the spotlight as Cait.\n\nUnless you live under a rock, you will have heard of Bruce Jenner's sex transition into Caitlyn Jenner. The Olympic star came out after the couple's divorce, and rewrote her own story at the age of 65. Caitlyn fronted the cover of Vanity Fair in an epic photo shoot to publicly present her new image to the world and explain the reasons behind her decision to transition. The interview caused major drama in the Kardashian clan, as it painted Kris Jenner as unsupportive.\n\nE! made a series called 'I Am Cait ' on Caitlyn, while on 'Keeping up with The Kardashians ', the sisters spoke up about how the transition affected their family.\n\nCaitlyn's relationship with the Kardashians has changed. The family feud took centre stage, as Caitlyn released a memoir that Kris Jenner argues portrayed her in a negative light.\n\nCaitlyn is now rumoured to be dating 23-year-old transgender model, Sophia Hutchins, who seems to have a great friendship with Kris. She also starred in I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\n\nWho: Founder of KKW Beauty and Skims, and the star of the show\n\nKnown for: Being the queen of selfies, kimojis, and frankly, all social media; her internet-breaking bum, her fashion evolution, contouring skills, and the story of her rise to fame.\n\nKim Kardashian (now Kim Kardashian West) is the middle sister, and probably the best known. Growing up, Kim Kardashian hung out with Paris Hilton (and Nicole Richie, of course), and consequently, her name made the tabloids. At just 19, in 2000, Kim got married to music producer Damon Thomas, they divorced three years later. Not long after, Kim started dating the American singer Ray J and the couple infamously made a sex tape that was leaked on the internet.\n\nKim has been married to music icon Kanye West since 2014, but is now sadly in the process of a divorce. The couple have 4 children: North, Saint, Chicago, Psalm (both Chicago and Psalm were via surrogate).\n\nAfter her divorce in 2000, Kim stayed unmarried but dated American Football player Reggie Bush, before finding love with NBA player Kris Humphries. In 2011, the couple got married in California and the ceremony was aired on national television as part of a spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians .\n\nOnly 72 days after their nuptials, Kim filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. The media called it a publicity stunt, but when the sisters were interviewed by David Letterman, Kourtney Kardashian set the record straight: \"'I think if she was going to do it for publicity, she’d pick someone that people knew.\" Snap, Khloe.\n\nNot long after Kim and Kris' divorce, the reality-star was spotted hanging out with Kanye West. The duo had been friends for several years and kept their new romance under wraps in the early stages. They’re marriage lasted 7 years and now they’re going through the divorce process while trying to co-parents four little ones.\n\nWho: Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, North West, Saint West, Chicago West, Psalm West\n\nTheir story: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West seemed meant to be, not only for their love of the limelight, but also because a romance blossomed from a friendship. Fans of the rapper already knew he only had eyes for Kim, rapping on his 2012 album: \"And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim; Around the same time she had fell in love with him; Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang; Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team\" - Jay Z owns the Brooklyn Nets, FYI - the basketball team for which Kris Humphries played at the time.\n\nKim and Kanye started dating the spring of that year. One year later and the couple were expecting their first baby, North West. North was born in 2013 before her parents got engaged, but of course a proposal was already in the works. In October 2013, Kanye proposed to Kim Kardashian, closing the San Francisco's AT&T park, surrounded by their family and friends - while the Jumbotron showed the words: \"Please marry me\".\n\nIn 2014, the Kardashian-Wests tied the knot in a very exclusive ceremony in Florence, Italy; after celebrating their engagement in Paris, and months after they made the cover of American Vogue. In February 2016, after two years happily married, the power couple welcomed their second child, baby Saint West.\n\nThe Kardashian-Wests welcomed their third child - via surrogate, since Kim was told by doctors that she would put her life at risk if she got pregnant again. The baby girl was born on January 15 2018 and is named Chicago West. They then had their fourth child via a surrogate, Psalm West, who was born on May 10, 2019. They’re now sadly going through a divorce so we hope they can resolve their issues amicably.\n\nWho: Father of Kourtney’s kids, otherwise known as Lord Disick\n\nKnown for: Being the most honest being in the family. The show's audience has divided opinions about Scott Disick, but whatever fans of the show say, he's definitely become an established member of the Kardashian family. He is also responsible for most of funny scenes on the show, and KUWTK wouldn't be the same without him. Scott has been dating Sofia Richie since September 2017 and now is with 20-year-old Amelia Hamlin, the model daughter of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Rinna and actor Harry Hamlin.\n\nWho: Good American co-founder and youngest Kardashian sister\n\nKnown for: Her dedication to the gym and her straight-talking approach, oh and those immaculate cookie jars in her kitchen.\n\nKhloé is the youngest of the Kardashian sisters, and weirdly has made more TV appearances than Kim. She's been in three spin-offs of the original family series, and was the star of two shows from E! , Kocktails with Khloé and Revenge Body. She was also did a short stint as a host of the American version of The X Factor, next to Mario Lopez and had her own radio show, The Mix Up With Khloé Kardashian Odom.\n\nKhloé looks rather different from her sisters which has sparked rumours about her parentage. She was home schooled as a child as she recalls being bullied on KUWTK.\n\nKhloé became a fitness enthusiast a few years ago and showed off her body transformation in her book, 'Strong Looks Better Naked'. The book was a best seller and inspired E!'s Revenge Body series.\n\nKhloé's love life has been nothing short of rocky. Khloé married the basketball Lamar Odom in 2009, after the pair dated for just three months. The couple got their own reality show and even a wedding special on E! , but the couple got divorced in 2016 after Lamar's battle with substance abuse.\n\nAfter being traded several times between teams, Lamar found himself without any new opportunities, and in 2013 he didn't sign an NBA contract. That same year, Lamar was arrested for a DUI and checked into rehab, after his family urged him to get treatment. His time at the rehab was short-lived after just one day in the facilities, and a couple of months later he and Khloé started seeing a marriage counselor. In the end of 2013, Khloé filed for divorce, a source told E! News: \"It wasn't any easy decision, but at the end of the day she's not going to stay with someone who refuses to get help.\"\n\nKhloé then started dating French Montana, while Lamar was signed by the New York Knicks. In 2015, the couple filed documents to finalise their divorce, but three months later, Lamar was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, having suffered a drug overdose. Khloé then called off the divorce when the basketball player woke up from a one-month coma. The Kardashian family was very present throughout his recovery. Khloé and Lamar officially finalised their divorce in 2016. \"They're relieved it's over and ready to move on with their lives\" a source told E! News.\n\nKhloé is currently dating Canadian basketball player, Tristan Thompson and the couple had their first child together True Thompson in 2018. Although that relationship has also been rocky, with multiple cheating scandals from Tristan, some of which were when Khloe was heavily pregnant and the biggest one being with Kylie’s best friend. However it seems that Khloe appears to have called it quits.\n\nWho: Tristan Thompson, Khloe Kardashian, True Thompson\n\nTheir story: Canadian Basketball player Tristan Thompson and Khloe Kardashian have been dating since 2016 on and off, although they’re not married yet, there have been rumours of an engagement.\n\nIn April 2018, Khloe gave birth to their baby girl called True Thompson. After rumours of Tristan cheating on Khloe during her pregnancy, the couple finally came to blows when it was revealed he'd cheated on Khloe again, but this time with Kylie's BFF, Jordyn Woods. They appear to be playing happy families again but whether they will take their relationship to the next level is yet to be seen.\n\nWho: Known as Rob / The brother we never see. The only Kardashian / Jenner son.\n\nKnown for: His sock business, being MIA for most part of the series, and most recently getting together with his sister's ex-boyfriend's mother’s child (Yep, you've read that right).Robert Kardashian Jr. is the youngest member of the Kardashian clan and has famously stayed out of the limelight - in comparison to his sisters. In fact, he was MIA for most of the family's show seasons, due to his struggles with anxiety and depression. The star gained weight while beating his demons, but has been on a path to a healthier lifestyle since. Aside from being featured in 'Keeping up with The Kardashians', Rob was a finalist in 2011's 'Dancing With The Stars', and was a judge in the 2012 Miss USA pageant. He also runs his own socks company, Arthur George - the label's name is a combination of his middle name, Arthur, and his father's, George. Rob returned to telly next to his ex-fiancé, Blac Chyna, who is also his sister's ex-boyfriend's baby mama (do keep up).\n\nIf this sounds complicated, it's because it is. The situation couldn't get any more reality series worthy. Let us explain: Blac Chyna is Tyga's ex-girlfriend, Blac and Tyga have a son together, King Cairo. Tyga split from Kylie Jenner in 2016, Rob's youngest sister with whom she had been in an on-off relationship for two years.\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna started dating in January 2016, and became Instagram-official with a post captioned 'The beginning'. In April that year, they got engaged, and in May they welcomed a baby girl together, Dream Renée Kardashian. Although there's been plenty of drama in between their engagement and pregnancy, the biggest fall-out of the couple came after their daughter's birth. Blac Chyna's Instagram account was hacked and messages about Rob and his family, sent by the video-vixen, were made public. In the texts Chyna called Rob \"lazy,\" \"fat\" and \"insecure\", and mentioned trademarking her newfound Kardashian last name after matrimony. Rob recently posted naked pictures of Blac on Instagram in a revenge porn scandal.\n\nAfter the couples' social media spat, Rob took to Snapchat to show that Chyna had left his house with their baby. It was later confirmed that they were living in separate homes. The couple engaged in an on-off relationship and officially broke up in February, calling off their engagement. Chyna was then spotted without her ring. But the couple are still co-parenting their daughter, Dream. There seems to be some bad blood between Chyna and the entire Kardashian family as she currently has a lawsuit against them.\n\nKhloe confirmed on the Keeping Up reunion that Rob is dating at the moment, but offered up no specifics.\n\nWho: The eldest Jenner sister, the supermodel.\n\nKnown for: Her top modelling career, her model-esque figure, her model off-duty style (did you get the hint that she is a model, yet?), and her skills in front of and behind the camera.\n\nKendall has taken her career in quite a different direction from her older and younger sisters, encouraged to pursue modelling by her mum. Kendall has now fronted the runways and campaigns of major haute couture labels, like Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada and Fendi. The model tops the list of new faces taking the fashion scene by storm, along with her best friends Gigi and Bella Hadid.\n\nKendall's modelling career has kept her away from the Keeping up with The Kardashians ' cameras, as she is constantly travelling for work. Kendall keeps her social life more private than her sisters, but loves using her Instagram to share one of her other passions - being behind the camera.\n\nRomantically, Kendall has been linked to the likes of Justin Bieber, Harry Styles, A$AP Rocky, Anwar Hadid, Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons but most recently she has gone official in a relationship with basketball player Devin Booker.\n\nWho: Youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner family, first billionaire of the family, founder of Kylie Cosmetics\n\nKnown for: Her beauty empire, her lips, almost dethroning Kim as the queen of social media and her daring outfits.\n\nKylie Jenner may be the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenners but at 19 years old, the star has already built a beauty empire based on her signature look (plump pouts are now a big thing because of her). Her USP, the lip kit, which consists of a lip pencil and lip paint, consistently sells out in seconds. The same goes for everything she launches. Don't believe us? Ask Forbes. Kylie is the youngest celeb to make the Forbes 100.\n\nKylie has been in an on-off relationship with rapper Tyga, in her late teens. The couple then split up for good and she was then spotted dating Travis Scott and the parents have been seen going on-and-off ever since. It appears they’re on at the moment.\n\nE! News had almost broken the internet when they announced they had inside sources telling them Kylie and Travis were expecting their first baby - not long after the Kardashians confirmed Kim's and Khloé's baby news.\n\nKylie and Travis welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Stormi on February 1, 2018. Not long after Kylie released a makeup collection inspired by her first born's name.\n\nForbes announced Kylie had overtaken Mark Zuckerberg as the world's youngest ‘self-made billionaire’.\n\nWho: Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott, Stormi Webster\n\nTheir story:Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott had been dating since April 2017. Rumours swirled around the couple after a series of loved-up courtside pictures, Miami struts and Instagram posts.\n\nAfter two months of dating, the pair were seen getting matching tattoos, all before revealing they were expecting their first baby together.
