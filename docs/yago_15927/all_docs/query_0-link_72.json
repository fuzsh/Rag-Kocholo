        "text": "Do we hear wedding bells?\n\nKris Jenner teased her marriage plans with boyfriend Corey Gamble — and it seems as though we could be seeing the “momager” walk down the aisle soon.\n\nDuring the latest episode of “The Kardashians” Thursday, the matriarch, 68, revealed that she’s not ruling out saying “I do” for a third time in her life during a conversation with Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton.\n\nWhile filling in her gal pals on her upcoming hysterectomy surgery, Jenner was overcome with emotion as she told them that she was losing her ovaries.\n\nBut the news seemingly caught Hilton off-guard.\n\n“I thought you were gonna tell me you’re getting married,” the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” guest star told Jenner, who has been dating Gamble for a decade.\n\n“I mean, not right this very second,” she responded.\n\n“I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I’m like, ‘That’s a little early for me to be…'” Hilton said.\n\n“Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,” Jenner quipped. “I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I’m 70!”\n\nJenner and the music manager, 43, first sparked romance rumors after they connected at a mutual friend and fashion designer Riccardo Tisci’s 40th birthday party in Ibiza, Spain in 2014.\n\nGamble has since stayed by Jenner’s side appearing in several episodes of the family’s Hulu reality show and trotting the globe with her.\n\nThe couple recently sparked engagement rumors after Jenner was seen flashing a $1.2M diamond ring on social media in honor of Valentine’s Day 2023.\n\nStill, up until this point Jenner had claimed that she’d likely not walk down the aisle again after two failed marriages.\n\n“You know you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” she said on a September 2018 podcast episode of “Divorce Sucks!” with host Laura Wasser.\n\nJenner wed Robert Kardashian Sr. in 1978 and welcomed four kids — daughters Kourtney Kardashian, 45, Kim Kardashian, 43, and Khloé Kardashian, 40, and son Rob Kardashian, 37 — together before they called it quits in 1991."
