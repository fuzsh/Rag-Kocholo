        "text": "Kris Jenner opened up about saying “I do” to Corey Gamble.\n\nThe 68-year-old matriarch of the Kardashian family has been dating her longtime love for a decade now. Are they thinking about heading down the aisle anytime soon?\n\nShe provided a tentative schedule and even asked two people if they would be bridesmaids during the most recent episode of her family’s reality show The Kardashians.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nKris broached the topic of marriage while filling her friends Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick in on having her ovaries removed.\n\nAfter she broke the news, Kathy revealed that she’d been expecting wedding news, via People.\n\nWhile that’s definitely an option, Kris made it clear that they wouldn’t be getting married “right this very second.” When would she be interested? She teased “maybe when I’m 70.”\n\nKris did tell her friends that they could stand with her at the altar when the big day comes!"
