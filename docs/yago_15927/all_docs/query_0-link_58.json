        "text": "Kris Jenner has some mighty fabulous genes, that much we know. The mother of six children from two marriages, the 'Momager' doesn't just raise children, but moguls too. Now her babies are having babies at a staggering rate, and, to be quite honest, we're struggling to keep count of the Kardashian and Jenner kids.\n\nAfter the family ended their long-running hit show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians and launched The Kardashians, we're constantly finding ourselves in need of a refresh when it comes to remembering who makes up the famous brood.\n\nWhile staying in the loop with the family has been made easier now that Mason Disick has joined Instagram and Kim and her eldest daughter North West are on TikTok, as are Kourtney and daughter Penelope, not all the troupe are so forthcoming about posting pictures of their kids. For example, Kylie Jenner typically tends to keep her youngest, Aire, away from the spotlight.\n\nIf you're looking to the matriarch for answers, Kris Jenner's Instagram page is filled with the sweetest posts of all of her 14 grandchildren, yet 'keeping up' with them all can still get confusing, which is why we've put together a 'little' list of which Kardashian and Jenner child has had what baby and when. Going from eldest Kourtney Kardashian's four offspring to youngest Kylie Jenner's children Stormi and her son Aire.\n\nHere's the who's who of Kris' grandkids:\n\nIn a recent interview with the mother-of-two revealed that she had changed her son's name twice, before settling on Aire. Shortly after he was born in 2022, Kylie Jenner announced that she and the child's father, Travis Scott had named the child Wolf Jacques Webster. Then, in October 2023 she first revealed that she had changed his name to Aire, and dropped his middle name, Jacques.\n\nWhat was not previously known, was that after they had publicly announced his name as Wolf, the name Knight was also in the mix for a while, however, like Jacques, they have dropped this name.\n\nIn August 2022, a rep for Khloé Kardashian confirmed to People that she and Thompson had welcomed their second baby, a boy, via a surrogate, but a name had not yet been decided.\n\nIn May 2023, during The Kardashians season three premiere, Khloé confirmed that her and Thompson had named their son, Tatum.\n\nIn March 2023, Kardashian shared the first photos of her son's face to mark the occasion of ex-parter Thompson's birthday.\n\nPosting a heartfelt message to her 'baby daddy' on Instagram, Khloé shared various snaps of the 32-year-old NBA player with his children – 4-year-old True, 6-year-old Prince (who he shares with ex Jordan Craig) and the latest addition to the family, who is less than a year old.\n\nKhloé and Tristan's son can be seen wearing a sweet ghost-covered onesie in the photos, looking lovingly at his father in one snap and enjoying time with his siblings in the other."
