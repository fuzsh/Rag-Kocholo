        "text": "Does Kris Jenner have plans to walk down the aisle sometime soon? That could be the case after she hinted at a possible future where she marries her longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble, even going so far as to choose a couple bridesmaids.\n\nThe famed momager teased wedding plans in Thursday's (July 11) episode of The Kardashians, telling Faye Resnick and Kathy Hilton that she hasn't completely ruled out the possibility of another marriage, per Page Six. The hints come in the same episode where Jenner was \"sad\" about a surgical procedure she needed to undergo after doctors discovered a tumor. While sharing the emotional news with her friends, Hilton said she \"thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married.\"\n\nAfter the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch quipped, \"I mean, not right this second,\" Hilton continued, \"I thought you were gonna say six in the morning [tomorrow]. I'm like, 'That's a little early for me to be...\"\n\n\"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,\" Jenner continued, before recruiting her friends for the hypothetical big day, \"I mean, you guys can totally be bridesmaids when I get married. So maybe when I'm 70!\"\n\nJenner, 68, and Gamble, 43, have been dating for a decade, first sparking romance rumors after meeting through mutual friend and fashion designer Riccardo Tisci at his birthday party in 2014. The pair even sparked rumors of an engagement in 2023 after Jenner was seen sporting a massive diamond ring."
