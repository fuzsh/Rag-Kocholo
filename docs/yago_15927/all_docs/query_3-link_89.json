        "text": "It all started with a sex tape—and then grew into a multi-million dollar socialite-status empire, complete with a slew of lavish weddings. While Kim Kardashian's wedding to Kanye West was extremely over-the-top, she was just following in the lavish footsteps of her fellow siblings and parents.\n\nFrom opulent affairs to intimate family ceremonies, there's one thing that's for certain: the Kardashian clan certainly knows how to throw a wedding party—and momager Kris Jenner will always be there for it. Here, in chronological order, are the Kardashian weddings throughout the years.\n\nKris Houghton and Robert Kardashian\n\nFlight attendant Kris Houghton married 36-year-old attorney Robert Kardashian on July 8, 1978, at the young age of 22. During their marriage, they had four children: Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob. While not many details are available about their wedding, we do know a few things: it was a big wedding, everyone wore hats, and OJ Simpson was a groomsman, the Daily Mail reports. Speaking of the bridal party, pictures clearly show that the Kardashian matriarch started the white bridesmaid dresses trend—one that Kim Kardashian has emulated in each of her weddings—all the way back in the '70s.\n\nKris and Robert divorced in 1991, four years before the murder trial of O.J. Simpson (who Robert Kardashian represented in 1995). The famous lawyer died of esophageal cancer in 2003.\n\nKris Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner\n\nOne month after her divorce to Robert was finalized, Kris married former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, who was then known as Bruce Jenner, on April 21, 1991, with their respective children as the bridal party. Kris shared with the Daily Mail, \"It was a very intimate, small wedding—I had such a big wedding the first time and we just really wanted close family and friends [the second time].\" The two went on to have two girls, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, while raising their large, blended family of eight.\n\nAnd just like their wedding, the proposal was pretty low key. \"We were at a restaurant and he just dropped to a knee. We had been house-hunting all day and we were thinking about moving in together, and then I thought to myself, driving to the restaurant that we were going to, I must be out of my mind that we're house-hunting. We're not even married, we're not even engaged! And that night he just busted out a move. He said, 'I am totally in love with you and would you marry me?' I was very surprised,\" Kris shared. So surprised in fact that she didn't even need a ring. Caitlyn gave her a ring a mere 22 years later while the two were on vacation together in Bora Bora.\n\nThe couple's 23-year marriage ended seven years ago, with the pair separating in June 2013 and finalizing their divorce in December 2014.\n\nKim Kardashian and Damon Thomas\n\nWhile this union is a little-discussed marriage from Kim's past, Damon Thomas needs to be discussed. The music producer was 10 years older than the reality star, and the two tied the knot in Las Vegas when she was only 19. Kim was working as a sales assistant in the Los Angeles store Body when she decided to elope in Vegas with Thomas in 2000. After four years, the couple called it quits in 2004, according to Yahoo, with Kim accusing her ex of abuse. \"I got married because I clearly was young and it wasn't the best choice. I definitely learned a lot from it and I don't have regrets ever.\"\n\nKim Kardashian and Kris Humphries\n\nWhile not the shortest marriage ever on record, Kim's 72-day marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries was on major gossip column radar. The couple married in a lavish Montecito wedding back in August 2011, and even though they split soon after, their wedding was forever recorded on television, courtesy of E!. The socialite walked down a 196-foot long custom white runner which featured a black border, damask-like flourish details inspired by the pattern on the couple's invitations, and two Swarovski crystal monograms. Bridesmaids were decked out in white Vera Wang mermaid-style wedding gowns, which doubled as bridesmaid dresses in this case.\n\nKim and Kris got the party started with a costume change, with Kim ditching her first Vera Wang gown for an ivory mermaid Vera Wang—and Kris trading in his white Ermenegildo Zegna tux jacket for a black one. Kim shared that this wedding gown was her favorite of the three, according to Popsugar.\n\nIn her third outfit change (Vera Wang gown #3 of the bunch), the couple cut their lavish wedding cake—an 8-tier black and white creation. The newlyweds took a spin to \"Angels,\" performed live by Robin Thicke.\n\nUnfortunately, after just 72 days, the two divorced. Kim's dreamy diamond engagement ring—an emerald-cut, 16.21-carat center stone flanked by 1.8-carat diamonds on each side, sold for only $600,000 post-divorce (even though Humphries bought it for over $2 million). Luckily for Kim, she made out pretty well in the divorce—with over $2 million in wedding gifts and a whopping $1 million to host her wedding on live TV, according to the Daily Mail. So we're assuming she wasn't exactly broken up over her ex getting the rights to sell the ring.\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom\n\nAfter just one month of dating, the youngest Kardashian sister married Los Angeles Laker Lamar Odom on September 27, 2009. The event was hosted at family friend Irving Azoff's home on a Sunday evening. This lavish black-tie affair was televised (shocker!) in front of triple arches of white roses created by celebrity florist Mark Garden, People reports. Khloe was wearing a strapless, figure-hugging Vera Wang gown and lavender sash.\n\nThe celebrity guests at the lavish wedding included Laker Kobe Bryant, Chelsea Handler, and Lala Vazquez. Caitlyn Jenner walked her stepdaughter down the aisle, and her father-of-the-bride speech at the wedding televised on E!—regarding Robert Kardashian Sr.—gets us every time.\n\nBeing the breakout star of the Kardashian white bridesmaid trend, Khloe's bridesmaids were decked out in purple, while the tented reception had a Hollywood nightclub-themed vibe—complete with white carpeting, silver mirrors, and chandeliers. As far as entertainment, Babyface performed during the reception, and the couple flew in a DJ from Manhattan to keep the dancing happening until late in the evening.\n\nBut, in 2015 the couple signed divorce papers, and the divorce was finalized the following year.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West\n\nKim Kardashian tied the knot with Kanye West at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy on May 24, 2014. Donning a custom Givenchy bridal gown, the bride was walked down the aisle by her stepfather, Caitlyn Jenner, and her sisters—Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie, and Kendall—were close by during the ceremony.\n\nA source told E! News about the 2014 wedding, \"There are only 100 guests invited. It is only their closest friends and family. The couple had to be very selective and cut it off at no work friends no matter how close or cherished.\" But don't let the \"small\" wedding size fool you; the affair will go down in history as one of the most over-the-top celebrity weddings of all time, costing a grand total of $2.8 million.\n\nWhile they didn't get to get married in their top venue pick (oh you know, just the Versailles Palace), they did have their rehearsal dinner there, complete with a Lana del Rey performance, much to the surprise of the bride. Some of the celeb guests included Serena Williams, NeNe Leakes, Alexander Wang, and Andrea Boccelli, who serenaded the ceremony with \"Ave Maria\" as the bride walked down the aisle. Kim shares about the opera star, whom Kanye surprised her with on their big day, saying, \"My dad [Robert Kardashian] loved him too. It felt like I was walking down the aisle with my dad as [Bocelli] sang.\"\n\nOfficiated by Rich Wilkerson Jr., a pastor from North Miami, the ceremony vows took place in front of a stunning wall made entirely of white flowers. After, the bride and groom accompanied by their guests headed into a reception decked with marble tables and gold toilets. The newlyweds danced to their first dance with John Legend sang \"All of Me,\"—live, of course.\n\nThe one who started it all, momager Kris Jenner, describes the wedding to E!, \"Such a magical, romantic wedding. I feel blessed to have my new son and his family as part of ours.\"\n\nThe couple has four children together: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. But after six years of marriage, their love story may soon come to an end, with Kim expected to file divorce papers soon, according to rumors that surfaced on January 5, 2021."
