        "text": "Kris Jenner has been dating Corey Gamble for four years but don’t expect them to announce an engagement anytime soon.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star is reportedly not ready “to get married again,” according to a source via Hollywood Life.\n\n“Kris is content with where she’s at in her life with Corey and doesn’t ever see the need to get married again to Corey or anyone,” the source said. “She’s happy with the way things are and Corey doesn’t need a label, either. These two have no plans to marry.”\n\nThe insider added, “Corey is really close with all of her kids. He’s been really helpful with checking in on Rob [Kardashian] as well and is a real rock for Kris when she needs emotional support. Kanye [West] and Corey especially are really close.”\n\nJenner, 64, and Gamble, 39, first met in August 2014 at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci’s 40th birthday party, Cosmopolitan reports.\n\nGamble then appeared on his first episode of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” on E! in 2015, shortly after Jenner got divorced from Caitlyn Jenner, who was formally known as Bruce.\n\nIn the episode, Jenner and Gamble’s new relationship was revealed. In the installment of the reality series, Kim Kardashian West also told her sister Khloe Kardashian and Scott Disick how she warned her mom about taking it slow with Gamble.\n\nDisick then joked to Kim, saying, “Didn’t you get married both times after a couple of months?”\n\nLike every family, there were fights between Gamble and Jenner’s daughters featured on later episodes of “KUWTK,” but the family has now accepted Gamble as a major part of their lives.\n\n“[Corey] helps her a ton around the house and he’s there when she needs him and gives her her space when she wants it, too,\" the source said. \"Kris is very independent but her daughters like that Corey is around to help look after Kris and help with things.\""
