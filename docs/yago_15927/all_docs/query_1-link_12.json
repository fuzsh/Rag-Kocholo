The couple had four children together: Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Kardashian Jr.\n\nKRIS JENNER SAYS SHE HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY BILLS AFTER ROBERT KARDASHIAN SPLIT: 'I WAS EMBARRASSED'\n\nThe businesswoman and \"mom-ager\" then married Caitlyn Jenner and the pair welcomed two children — Kylie and Kendall Jenner. They announced their separation in October 2013.\n\nJenner continued to open up about her marriage with her ex-husband Kardashian.\n\n\"I’m not proud of the way I behaved during that time… Everything happens for a reason. I really do live my life by thinking God has a plan and without that whole thing happening there never would’ve been Kendall and Kylie,\" Jenner pointed out.\n\nKardashian died at age 59 on Sept. 30, 2003, less than eight weeks after he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He was lauded as a stout member of O.J. Simpson’s legal defense \"dream team\" after the former football star was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman in June 1994. Simpson was acquitted after what many still consider the \"trial of the century.\"\n\nJenner is currently dating Corey Gamble, 42, and the couple have been public with their relationship since 2015, shortly after she divorced Caitlyn Jenner. Gamble was previously Justin Bieber's tour manager.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe conversation about Kris cheating on her ex-husband was brought up as Khloe sought advice on her own tumultuous relationship.\n\nKHLOE KARDASHIAN WAS SECRETLY ENGAGED TO TRISTAN THOMPSON WHEN HE GOT ANOTHER WOMAN PREGNANT: REPORT\n\nThe 39-year-old was previously in a relationship with NBA star Tristan Thompson before she discovered he had fathered a child with Maralee Nichols while the pair were engaged.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThompson and Kardashian share two young children: daughter True, 5, and a son, Tatum, whom they welcomed via surrogate in August 2022."
