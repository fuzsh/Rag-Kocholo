        "text": "Kris Jenner is baring it all.\n\nThe Kardashians star—who was married to ex Robert Kardashian, Sr. for 12 years until their 1991 divorce—is opening up about why she was unfaithful to the late attorney. After daughter Khloe Kardashian asked her mom why she cheated in her past relationship during the latest episode of The Kardashians, Kris chalks up her decision to the mindset she had in her early 20s.\n\n\"I think being really young and dumb is something that plays into it,\" Kris—who also shares kids Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian with Robert—said during the Oct. 26 episode, \"because you don't really understand the consequences of your actions.\"\n\nAs for the exact reason she thinks she stepped outside of her relationship? Kris admitted that all these years later she's still not sure if she has a concrete answer.\n\n\"I don't know, because he was such a great husband and such a great dad,\" the mom of six explained to Khloe. \"And I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else and I made a huge mistake. That's like my life's biggest regret.\""
