        "text": "Long before she became the most famous momager in the world and built an empire, Kris Jenner (nee Houghton) married an attorney named Robert Kardashian Sr. in 1978. The couple had four children together — Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, and Robert Kardashian Jr. Their marriage though did not last.\n\nRobert caught Kris cheating with soccer player Todd Waterman and filed for divorce. That was finalized in 1991 and fans always had questions about how much O.J. Simpson’s lawyer paid his ex when they ended their marriage.\n\nHere’s the answer to that, plus how much Kris had to pay Caitlyn Jenner when they separated.\n\nKris did not get the amount she asked for when she divorced Robert Kardashian\n\nWhen he filed for his divorce from Kris, Robert also canceled her credit cards. Kris admitted that she had no money and couldn’t buy food.\n\n“I didn’t have anything,” she previously told Harvey Levin on the show OBJECTified. “I went to the market one day and my credit card didn’t work. I had a market credit card and I’m like, ‘I can’t even buy a tomato.'”\n\nOne of her friends comedian and actor Heather McDonald remembered what Kris told her about that time.\n\n“She said Robert didn’t want to be generous and didn’t want to keep her in the lifestyle that she’d been accustomed to,” McDonald recalled. “There was no prenup to protect her, and I think he was a very smart lawyer. It was not pleasant. He threatened her, like, ‘Wait until you’re in an apartment in the Valley.’ And she was like ‘How ugly is this gonna get and how can I continue on?’ That time was scary for her.”\n\nAccording to the documentary House of Kardashian, Kris sought $37,189 a month from Robert in child and spousal support. However, a judge awarded her just $4,000 a month.\n\nRobert went on to marry two more times. He died of esophageal cancer in September 2003.\n\nHow much Kris Jenner had to pay out in her divorce from Caitlyn Jenner\n\nFollowing her divorce from Robert, Kris married Caitlyn Jenner. They had two children, Kendall and Kylie.\n\nIn 2013, they announced their separation. Two years later, their divorce was finalized and this time it was Kris who had to pay up."
