        "text": "Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble have been inseparable ever since they met at a party hosted by Kanye West back in 2014.\n\nKris was in the middle of her split from Caitlyn Jenner when they met, but that didn't stop Corey from introducing himself to the momager. It didn't take long for the pair's relationship to heat up, despite their 25-year age gap.\n\nWhile Kris and Corey have gone from strength to strength, the momager has no plans to marry her boyfriend following her previous two divorces. Here, we've taken a look back at Kris and Corey's relationship timeline.\n\nAugust 2014: First meeting\n\nREAD MORE: Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny's relationship timeline in full after whirlwind romance\n\nKris and Corey's romance story first started in August 2014. They met while both in Ibiza to celebrate the 40th birthday party of their mutual friend, fashion designer Riccardo Tisci.\n\nThe party had been set up by Kris' then-son-in-law Kanye. At the time, the momager was in the middle of her divorce proceedings from Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nOctober 2014: First date\n\nIn early October 2014, Kris and Corey enjoyed their first public date together. They were spotted out to dinner in Sherman Oaks, California, with a fan snapping several pictures of them together.\n\nKourtney was asked about the outing by a fan and said he was excited for the relationship to take \"its course on a deeper level\". Later that month, they were spotted together while attending the Life Is Beautiful music festival in Las Vegas.\n\nKris and Corey enjoyed a set by Kanye at the festival before later being seen at Kim Kardashian's 34th birthday party at Tao Las Vegas.\n\nNovember 2014: Kris' 59th birthday\n\nJoin the Mirror's SMS news service to get the biggest breaking stories delivered straight to your phone. Click here to subscribe.\n\nIn the lead up to Kris' 59th birthday, Corey treated her to a quick getaway to Mexico. They then spent Kris' actual birthday in Las Vegas, enjoying dinner at Stack and a night out at 1 OAK.\n\nThe pair were joined in Las Vegas by Scott Disick. \"She [Kris] and Corey were very smitten with one another,\" a source told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nMarch 22, 2015: Corey's KUWTK debut\n\nThe couple took the next step in their relationship on March 22, 2015, when Corey made his debut appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. During the episode, Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian shared some spicy details about the couple.\n\nKim, who was living with the pair at the time, said she overheard the duo getting intimate, and complained about the \"moaning\" sounds she heard when Corey stayed over. Kim and her sisters also expressed their concerns that their mom was rushing into things.\n\n\"I'm worried about mom a little bit. She doesn't listen to me when I'm like, 'You know, you should really take it slow' â€¦ I just hope that my mom really thinks things through because I don't want her to rush into anything,\" Kim said.\n\nKris, however, wasn't happy with Kim's comments. She said: \"I can't do anything without getting criticized. It's uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's like everybody wants answers, everybody wants to know what the title is. It's like you're a bunch of haters.\"\n\nOctober 15, 2015: Kris talks sex\n\nDuring the season 10 finale of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kris called Corey her boyfriend for the first time. Speaking to her daughter Khloe Kardashian, she then got very candid about her sex life.\n\n\"I literally probably have too much sex. I'm exhausted,\" Kris said. Khloe was left visibly disgusted by her mom's comments.\n\nMay 2, 2016: Met Gala debut\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nKris and Corey put their romance on full display when they appeared at the 2016 Met Gala. The couple wore matching all-black ensembles, with Kris wearing a floor-length sequin gown. Corey went for a smart blazer and accessorized with a chunky silver necklace.\n\nOctober 2017: Split rumors surface\n\nKim Kardashian accidentally sparked split rumors between Corey and Kris when she shared a seemingly innocent snap of her mom. Captioning the post, Kim wrote: \"Caption this.... mine is SWF.\"\n\nSWF stands for \"single white female\". After seemingly realizing her mistake, Kim changed her caption and removed the SWF.\n\nJanuary 2018: Children's concern\n\nKris' children were skeptical when she first started dating Corey, who is 25 years her junior. While her sisters warmed to the romance, Khloe Kardashian remained worried.\n\nIn an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Khloe quizzed Corey on why he was standoffish with her. He replied: \"I like all of y'all, but y'all are girls. I'm a dude and I know how that s**t can go. I'm a young dude dating your mom. Y'all are not really my f***ing kids. We are technically peers.\"\n\nAugust 2018: Diamond ring appears\n\nIn August 2018, Kris and Corey sparked engagement rumors after the momager was spotted with a huge diamond ring. She avoided speaking about the bling on The Late Late Show With James Corden and when playing a game of Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts, Kris chose to eat a cricket instead of answering any questions.\n\nSoon after, she insisted she has no plans to marry again. Appearing on Laura Wasser's podcast, Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser, Kris said: \"You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past.\n\n\"I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up. I don't have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I've done that. I've had the big wedding, I've had the babies and the kids.\"\n\nKris continued: \"I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I'm looking forward to my future and I just don't think that I want to go there.\"\n\nMarch 2021: Gushing tribute\n\nKris shared a gushing tribute about Corey in early 2021, describing him as an incredible support system. Speaking to WSJ Magazine, she said: \"He's the greatest guy, and he's just an amazing support system for me, and he really gives me a lot of strength and insight. He's a great sounding board. And he loves my kids and my mom, and they love him.\"\n\nMay 22, 2022: Wedding absence\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner clan had a lot to celebrate in 2022, when Kourtney Kardashian tied the knot with Travis Barker. The pair said \"I do\" in front of their friends and family in Italy.\n\nKourtney was walked down the aisle by her mom Kris and the matriarch was seen getting emotional as her eldest daughter tied the knot. However, boyfriend Corey was nowhere to be seen.\n\nFans became convinced the pair had split, but a source later explained the reason for Corey's absence. \"He is still very much private and prefers low-key celebrations where there aren't a lot of photographers.\n\n\"He doesn't like being in the spotlight. The whole affair would have been too much for him,\" the source told Us Magazine at the time.\n\nJuly 15, 2022: Career support\n\nIn July 2022, Kris launched her new personal branding MasterClass. Speaking to People, Kris opened up about how Corey has supported her throughout her career.\n\n\"I think Corey is super. He's an amazing guy. He's really supportive and he's really dialed into a lot of the different things,\" she said.\n\nKris added: \"He's very knowledgeable about a lot of the things that I work on, and he really helps me in trying to think through some of the decisions I make. He's such a great person to bounce things off of.\"\n\nSeptember 8, 2022: Husband material\n\nYears after sparking wedding rumors, Kris admitted she could walk down the aisle again. During an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, she took a lie detector test and was asked about her relationship goals.\n\nJames asked: \"Is Corey husband material?\" Instantly, Kris replied: \"Yes, he is. He's the best.\" The lie detector showed she was telling the truth.\n\nJuly 11, 2023: Friends on holiday\n\nKris and Corey have enjoyed a number of luxury holidays throughout their relationship. In July 2023, the couple were seen spending time on a yacht off the coast of Spain.\n\nThey weren't alone for the holiday, with pals Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi joining them. \"Life was meant for good friends and great adventures,\" Kris wrote on Instagram under a picture of the group."
