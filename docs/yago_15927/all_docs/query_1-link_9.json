        "text": "Kris Jenner and Robert Kardashian may have been divorced at the time of his death in 2003, but that didn't stop them from confessing their love on Robert's death bed.\n\nThe former flames tied the knot in 1978 and welcomed four children together - Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Jr. Robert and Kris divorced in 1991 after Kris' affair with Todd Waterman was exposed, but they managed to establish a close friendship after their split.\n\nTragedy sadly struck the Kardashian family in September 2003 when Robert died just two months after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. In the latest episode of The Kardashians, it was revealed Kris managed to share a loving moment with her ex-husband before he died.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Kanye West and Bianca Censori 'split up after her friends stage an intervention'\n\nIn the episode, Kourtney Kardashian sat down to interview her dad's first cousin Cici Bussey. The pair spoke about Kris and Robert's divorce, with Cici explaining how Robert's mother Helen Kardashian didn't want the family to speak to Kris following the divorce.\n\nCici said Kris was essentially kicked out the family, but she was determined to have a relationship with the momager so she could still see the Kardashian kids. Cici told Khloe: \"And when your mom went over there before he passed away, remember Kim snuck her in?\n\n\"Urgh, donâ€™t even get me started.\" Khloe asked what happened and Cici explained: \"Well, they said their goodbyes. I think they professed their love and she said, 'You're the love of my life' and he said the same thing and he died.\"\n\nDescribing Robert and Kris' relationship, Cici said: \"It just, it was fabulous and amazing until it wasn't and that's the truth. It was magical until it wasn't. And that one day, it ended.\"\n\nShe became upset as she told Khloe that Robert was still angry at her until the day he died. She said he taught her that \"the lesson is family first\".\n\nCici explained: \"When your mom and dad were getting a divorce, the phone would ring, Helen calling me, 'What's she doing? You've gotta fix it'. She thought I could fix it.\n\n\"And your dad got mad at me - because your grandma said, 'Nobody can talk to her [Kris],' and I said, 'I can't do that because then I wouldn't be able to talk to Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe and Rob'. So I was outed.\" She continued: \"Nobody talked to me and your dad didn't talk to me and he was furious at me till he died and that's my biggest regret.\"\n\nNew episodes of The Kardashians S4 stream weekly on Disney+"
