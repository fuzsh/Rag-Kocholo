        "text": "KRIS Jenner and Corey Gamble's relationship status has been confirmed amid rumors that they're headed for marriage.\n\nThe Kardashians star recently sparked engagement rumors after sharing a snap showing off a massive diamond ring.\n\nWhile it appeared wedding bells may be in Kris, 67, and Corey's future, it's since been reported that the Hulu star has no plans to wed her longtime love.\n\nA source close to the business mogul told The Daily Mail that Kris' massive rock is 'definitely' not an engagement ring.\n\nIn fact, she \"has had that ring for three years and has worn it out countless times.\"\n\nThe insider maintained: \"Kris is not engaged to Corey, and she has no plans to be. She really has no need to marry him because she has exactly what she wants with him right now.\"\n\nAccording to the source: \"Kris does not want to put anything on paper regarding their relationship because she knows that, if their relationship does end, God forbid, it would not end well if they were married.\"\n\nKris has been with Corey since 2015.\n\nShe was married two times before: once to Caitlyn Jenner and, prior to that, to Robert Kardashian.\n\nKris has spoken about her relationship to Corey several times, as well as her desire for marriage.\n\nDuring a 2018 interview on esteemed attorney Laura Wasser's podcast, Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser, she said that she would probably not marry Corey.\n\nAt the time, she revealed: \"You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past.\n\n\"I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up.\"\n\nMASSIVE ROCK\n\nMarriage rumors began swirling earlier this month after Kris was spotted rocking an enormous ring on her left hand.\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner matriarch posted a photo of a large diamond ring on her wedding ring finger around Valentine's Day.\n\nKris shared a sweet but simple tribute to Corey on her Instagram Story.\n\nShe followed that post up with a close-up show of the ring on her left ring finger.\n\nIt featured a simple band with an enormous shining stone sitting in the center.\n\nShe placed her hand over Corey's as he sat next to her in the romantic photo.\n\nA small portion of her Valentine's outfit could be seen, with a bright red cuff peeking into the image, and she added a starry filter over the top.\n\nDue to the size and placement of the ring, fans were quick to wonder whether Kris and Corey had taken their relationship to the next phase.\n\nOn Reddit, Kardashian followers had mixed opinions about what the ring could mean.\n\nThe original poster posed the question: \"Did you see Kris’ latest Instagram story? A new ring from him? Engaged?\"\n\nOne commenter stated: \"I was thinking engagement\"\n\nAnother fan was less sure: \"Would Kris even want to get married again though?\n\n\"This is partially me kinda wishing she wouldn’t lol since business arrangement or not I find it cute they’ve stuck together without feeling the need to tie the knot.\n\n\"Either way, a Kris wedding sounds like fun content for the show,\" they concluded.\n\nIt is not known if Kris' ring is an engagement ring from Corey.\n\nIn photos as early as December last year it looks like the same ring may have sat on Kris' hand.\n\nLong before that, the mother-of-six would regularly wear rings on her engagement finger.\n\nBREAKUP BUZZ?\n\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that Kris may have split from Corey after fans noticed that he was missing from photos of big family events.\n\nHowever, rumors were laid to rest when the momager shared a series of throwback snaps, including one of her music producer beau.\n\nThe couple has been together for the best part of the last decade, having started dating years ago after meeting in Ibiza.\n\nSince then, the couple has been open with their admiration of each other on social media, with Corey becoming a key family member.\n\nWhat's more, this isn't the first time speculation about the couple's relationship status has grown, with fans previously thinking that the duo might be secretly married.\n\nLast year, photos of Kris in a stunning white dress with Corey in a sharp suit made many think that the pair tied the knot while vacationing in Italy."
