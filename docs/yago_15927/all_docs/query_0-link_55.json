        "text": "Kris Jenner has had a well-documented life. Now, she’s opening up about the biggest regret she has.\n\nIn Thursday’s episode of The Kardashians, the matriarch of the extended Kardashian-Jenner clan revealed that her “life’s biggest regret” was cheating on her first husband, the late Robert Kardashian Sr. She had four children with Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Robert Jr. It was in a conversation with Khloé, discussing her daughter’s on-again, off-again relationship with Tristan Thompson, with whom she has two children, that the subject of Kris’ past came up.\n\nKris and Robert Sr. were married from July 1978 to March 1991. Kris said that she cheated with Todd Waterman, a former soccer player and animator, while still married and after giving birth to the four children. “Being really young and dumb is something that plays into it because you don’t really understand the consequences of your actions,” she said. She called Robert “such a great husband and such a great dad.”\n\n“I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else, and I made a huge mistake,” she said. “That’s my life’s biggest regret.”\n\nKris met Caitlyn Jenner in 1990, a year before her divorce from Robert was finalized. They married in April 1991. They had two children together, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and divorced in 2015.\n\n“I'm not proud of way I behaved during that time, but you know what? Everything happens for a reason,” Kris told her daughter of her past. “I really do live my life by thinking God has a plan, and without that whole thing happening, there never would’ve been Kendall and Kylie.”\n\nIn a 2012 interview with the Mail Online, Waterman said that they began their affair in 1990, and that it ended when Kris caught him in bed with someone else.\n\n“The love swept us away,” he said. “We made our own different reality. It was special, it was a little crazy, a little wild—we didn’t exercise caution or self-restraint. I think we were both very much in love.”\n\nIn the same interview, he admitted to regrets of his own.\n\n“There’s several things I regret and it’s definitely the pain that it did cause Robert and the children specifically,” he said. “I think it affected Kourtney the most. I know she was definitely affected and I always felt bad about that.”\n\nA representative for Kris Jenner declined to comment."
