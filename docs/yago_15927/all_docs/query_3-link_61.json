You think I'm gonna get married and not have a big-ass party? I'm not secretly married. I swear to God on all my kids and Daddy.\" Watch the clip above.\n\nKris was referring to her first husband, the late Robert Kardashian, who is the father of her four eldest children: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob. The reality star also shares daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner with ex Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nREAD MORE: Johnny Depp's surprise move following trial\n\nAs for Gamble, Kris began dating him shortly after they met at a party in 2014 when she was fresh from her split from Caitlyn. However, they didn't go public with their romance until 2015.\n\nAlthough the pair have yet to marry, Kris did reveal Corey, 41, has moved into her new Calabasas home in California.\n\nREAD MORE: Mum shocked by 'little white grains' on daughter's toenail\n\n\"He's been so amazing moving into the house because he really handles everything,\" she says on the show. \"There's so much security. I love that side of him because he's always really protective.\"\n\nAs for her children, they have always approved and welcomed Corey into the family, despite having reservations about the couple's 25-year age gap.\n\n\"I'm worried about Mum a little bit,\" Kim said on their reality show when the pair first started dating. \"She doesn't listen to me when I'm like, 'You know, you should really take it slow.' … I just hope that my mum really thinks things through because I don't want her to rush into anything.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
