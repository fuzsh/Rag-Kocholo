        "text": "“Rob! What do you think is the perfect girl for Scott?” Kris was seen asking her son. Rob took a moment before responding with an annoyed answer that had to be bleeped out, according to Us Weekly.\n\nHe wasn’t always so camera shy though. Rob was once a mainstay on KUWTK, not only showcasing his love life – from relationships with The Cheetah Girls’ Adrienne Bailon to Blac Chyna – and joining in the family feuds, but was also seen sharing sweet moments with his sisters Kim, Kourtney and Khloé, half sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner and mum Kris.\n\nSo where is Rob Kardashian now and what has he been up to in 2023?\n\nRob Kardashian has been a busy dad\n\nUnlike his famous sisters, Rob has opted to shield his daughter from the public eye. Most of the time anyway. She does make occasional appearances on his Instagram.\n\nKardashian shares one child with his controversial ex girlfriend Blac Chyna. The couple welcomed their daughter Dream Renée Kardashian in 2016.\n\nThe doting dad shared in a post about his daughter, “I love her so much and I thank God every day for her cuz she is the best and she is my best friend.”\n\nAfter a bumpy start, Kardashian and Blac Chyna have said they are now dedicated to co-parenting, according to People.\n\nWhat does Rob Kardashian do for a living now?\n\nAs reported by Hello!, Kardashian, 36, continues to pursue his business ventures. The same article states that the Kardashian sibling runs Grandeza hot sauce, sock company Arthur George and clothing label Halfway Dead.\n\n“My income now is insufficient to pay for my expenses. As of January 17, 2018, I am short nearly US$300,000 … I no longer own a home. I now live in my mother’s home,” added Rob. Per Entertainment Tonight, Rob’s Instagram account is now run by Jenner Communications.\n\nNevertheless, things might be looking up, as Kardashian still has an impressive net worth of US$10 million as of 2023, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nDoes he still make public appearances?\n\nThese days, Rob is rarely seen at events. In fact, he didn’t even go to his sister Kourtney and drummer Travis Barker’s star-studded Italian wedding last year, per E! News.\n\nNor did he go to (now exes) Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s wedding in 2014. “I was doing my suit fittings in Paris right before the wedding and I just wasn’t comfortable,” he told People in 2016. “I’m six-foot-one [185cm] and at my most I probably weighed 300lbs [136kg]. There were cameras at the airport on our trip there and I was very unhappy with the person I saw in all the pictures. I’m upset I missed my sister’s wedding, but it was a personal decision.”\n\nWill Rob ever rejoin the reality TV world?\n\nSources close to Kardashian say he’s trying to avoid more drama, and prioritising his own health and the well-being of his daughter, Distractify reports. But it might not be the end of reality TV for the only Kardashian brother.\n\nIn the last episode of The Kardashians’ third season, Khloé – founder of clothing brand Good American – responded to a question about whether she thought her brother would return to the show.\n\nShe said, “I do think Rob would come to the show. He talks about it a lot; he does. But I do know Rob has been through a lot personally, but he’s literally the best dad I know, and I’m so proud of him for that. And I know that he’s just feeling really good about himself, and I’m happy for him. So I have faith that soon he’ll be back on the show.”"
