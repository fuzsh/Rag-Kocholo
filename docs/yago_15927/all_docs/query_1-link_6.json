        "text": "Synopsis\n\nCaitlyn Jenner discusses her open talk with the late Robert Kardashian Sr. during his contentious divorce from Kris Jenner.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner has revealed additional details about her relationship with the late Robert Kardashian Sr.\n\nIn fact, the former Olympian said that during Robert Kardashian's ugly divorce from Kris Jenner in 1991, Caitlyn went to bat for her ex-wife.\n\n\"She was having a rough time with Robert in the divorce when I came into the picture,\" Caitlyn says in the new documentary House of Kardashian that was produced by Peacock and is now accessible to view on Netflix. \"He did everything he could to make her life miserable.\" As I observed what was taking place from a distance, I remarked to myself, \"This is crazy.\" Then I got out my phone, called Robert, and said, \"Hey, how about we go out to dinner?\"\n\nThe 74-year-old continued by saying, \"We met at Hamburger Hamlet on Sunset Boulevard, just the two of us in a booth in the back,\" describing the setting of their first encounter. And she further said that she basically told him that she (Kris) is moving on. She told him, \"I can take over from here,\" and he agreed. Therefore, let's keep this final paper signature as straightforward and uncomplicated as we possibly can.' And he did.\n\nCaitlyn and Kris married one month after their divorce was finalized at a friend's residence in Bel-Air.\n\n\"We had been together for five months and were having a wonderful time,\" Caitlyn said of their relationship. \"I wanted to get the wedding over with so we could get back to normal life, even though we have four kids and four step-kids.\" \"As normal as we can make it.\"\n\nEven though Kris and Robert broke up badly because she cheated on him while they were married, Robert stayed in Kris's life and helped raise her kids, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian. Besides Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Caitlyn had four other children from previous relationships. Their names are Burt Jenner, Cassandra Jenner, Brandon Jenner, and Brody Jenner.\n\nThe I Am Cait actress even disclosed the last private discussion she had with Robert only days before he died of esophageal cancer in 2003.\n\n\"He was really hurting,\" she remembered, \"and I told him, 'Hey, remember, if I were in your situation, my only concern would be for my kids.'\" That the kids will get through this. I just want you to know that I will be there for the kids at all times.' 'Oh, you didn't have to say that,' he says. 'I knew you'd do it.' And he died a week later.\"\n\nHouse of Kardashian is now available on Peacock.\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ1: Who are Caitlyn Jenner's ex wives?\n\nAns. Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner.\n\nQ2: Who are Caitlyn Jenner's children?\n\nAns.
