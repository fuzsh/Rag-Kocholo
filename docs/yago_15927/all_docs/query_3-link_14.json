        "text": "Kris Jenner's love life became one of the biggest storylines on the reality TV show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nFollowing her split from her ex Caitlyn Jenner, with whom she shares daughters Kendall and Kylie, the 68-year-old momager started dating talent manager Corey Gamble, 43. Not only has he made several TV and red carpet appearances with Kris, but he has also developed a bond with her six children.\n\nFrom their first meeting in Ibiza to sparking engagement rumors, here's everything you need to know about Kris and Corey's love story…\n\nFirst meeting\n\nThe couple reportedly first crossed paths at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday party in Ibiza in August 2014. Kris had not yet finalised her divorce from Caitlyn, but that didn't stop the pair from growing close.\n\nIn October, they were spotted on dinner dates, while Kris later admitted that they spent time in Paris together during their early relationship.\n\n\"I love being in Paris with Corey, because Corey and I started dating in Paris,\" she said during an episode of The Kardashians. \"So he always plans a really special night for us while we're here.\"\n\nGoing public\n\nAfter keeping their romance low-key for seven months, Kris and Corey went public with their relationship in March 2015 when the actor and producer joined the Kardashian-Jenner clan on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nHowever, Corey was not initially welcomed into the family by Kourtney, Kim and Khloe.\n\n\"I'm worried about mom a little bit. She doesn't listen to me when I'm like, 'You know, you should really take it slow' … I just hope that my mom really thinks things through because I don't want her to rush into anything,\" Kim confessed, causing her mother to become defensive of her relationship.\n\n\"I can't do anything without getting criticized. It's uncomfortable. It's like everybody wants answers, everybody wants to know what the title is. It's like you're a bunch of haters,\" she responded.\n\nOne month later, Corey went Instagram official with Kris by posting a photo of a double date with Billy Ray Cyrus and his now ex-wife Tish.\n\nBy May 2016, the pair had begun walking the red carpet together, making their debut at the Met Gala.\n\nAge gap\n\nKris' eldest children initially described the couple's age gap as \"creepy\", and she admitted she also struggled with the idea of dating someone 25 years her junior.\n\nThe dynamics created distance between Corey and Khloe, who confronted him about being standoffish with her in January 2018.\n\nHe replied: \"I like all of y'all, but y'all are girls. I'm a dude and I know how that [expletive] can go. I'm a young dude dating your mom. Y'all are not really my [expletive] kids. We are technically peers.\"\n\nLooking back at her relationship in May 2024, Kris said she had come to terms with their age difference.\n\n\"I used to say to Corey all the time when I first started dating him, like, 'Why do you want to date somebody who is older than you?' I didn't get the age gap, and then he taught me that age is just a number,\" she said.\n\n\"Listen, I can't explain someone's chemistry, or why people fall in love, but it's been an amazing almost 10 years, and we have a great time!\"\n\nEngagement rumors\n\nKris and Corey first sparked engagement rumours in August 2018 when she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand.\n\nHowever, she shut down any possibility of them walking down the aisle during an appearance on the Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser podcast.\n\nSpeaking about weddings, Kris – who was married to the late Robert Kardashian before she wed Caitlyn – said: \"You know, you never say never, but I often say it's just not what I think I need to do again based on my past.\n\n\"I'm in a really great relationship right now, and I'm happy and I don't want to mess that up… I don't have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I've done that. I've had the big wedding, I've had the babies and the kids.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I'm looking forward to my future and I just don't think that I want to go there.\"\n\nFour years later, Kris sparked the rumor mill once again by calling her partner \"husband material\".\n\nDuring a lie detector test on The Late Late Show with James Corden, the comedian asked: \"Is Corey husband material?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is. He's the best,\" she answered truthfully, according to the lie detector.\n\nFamily comments\n\nDespite their initial reservations, the Kardashian-Jenner family have been largely supportive of Kris and Corey's relationship.\n\n\"Corey was over last night and he's great. I love him,\" Khloé told E! News in November 2014, shortly after the pair started dating. \"He's so sweet and my mum is really happy. I like to see her in such a positive, happy state.\"\n\nKris' youngest child Kylie said on the reality TV show: \"I love Corey. I think that he's just an amazing person, I think he treats my mom amazing, and he's just helped me navigate through life, and I really appreciate his advice. He's just always been a good, good guy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall admitted their relationship had been tumultuous in the past.\n\n\"Corey and I, we were close for a while, and then Kylie and I had a big sister fight, and he tried to intervene, and that caused a little problem between us,\" she said.\n\nAfter addressing their problems during a trip to Mexico, Kendall added: \"I think sometimes that's what makes these family trips really important. It gives Corey and me the opportunity to slow down and actually spend some time together.\"\n\nKris and Corey now live in a $20 million mansion in Hidden Hills next door to her daughter Khloe. They share the sprawling home with their puppy Bridgette, which they adopted from The Wagmor Pet Hotel & Spa in Los Angeles in January 2020.\n\nHe later joked that he is the one who takes on most of the \"parenting\" duties. \"Kris is the one that wanted a dog, but I'm doing like, 99.7 percent of all dog duties. So what I think I've got to do now, is all the attention that I used to give Kris, I've got to just give it all to Bridgette.\n\n\"Maybe this could actually get her attention and she'll start giving me a little support and help on the parenting side,\" Corey said."
