        "text": "Background\n\nBorn on February 22, 1944, in Los Angeles, California, Robert Kardashian grew up in the wealthy View Park area. He studied at the Susan Miller Dorsey High School and graduated with a B.S. degree in business administration from the University of Southern California in 1966. Kardashian pursued his J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced law for less than a decade before venturing into business.\n\nIn 1973, Kardashian and his partners founded “Radio & Records,” a trade publication, which was sold for a significant profit in 1979. He also spearheaded playing music between films in theaters. He then parlayed the idea into a business, starting an organization called “Movie Tunes.” Kardashian filled in as president and C.E.O. of the firm. Later, he invested in a frozen yogurt organization called “Juice Inc” and “Concert Cinema,” a music video business.\n\nRobert had four children: Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Rob. Not long after separating from Kris Jenner in 1991, Kardashian was engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, his third cousin, but they were never married. Kardashian married Jan Ashley in 1998, but after 30 days, the marriage ended. Kardashian dated Ellen Pierson for three years, and they got married six weeks before his death.\n\nAt the age of 59, Robert Kardashian was diagnosed with cancer. On September 30, 2003, he passed away at his home in Los Angeles. Kardashian was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in California."
