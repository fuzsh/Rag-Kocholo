        "text": "Kris Jenner is reflecting on her enduring love for Corey Gamble on ‘The Kardashians.’\n\nThe latest episode features the longtime couple enjoying a romantic getaway in Paris, where their love story began 10 years ago.\n\nDuring a luxurious, moonlit dinner overlooking the Eiffel Tower, Kris reminisces about their first date in the City of Lights. She playfully compares the scene to ‘The Bachelorette,’ highlighting the intimacy and child-free atmosphere.\n\nIn a confessional, Kris opens up about the initial reservations she had regarding their 25-year age gap. She playfully quotes Corey's response, “Age is just a number. It's a f***ing big number, but it's a number!”\n\nDespite initial doubts, Kris acknowledges their undeniable chemistry and the joy they've shared over nearly a decade together.\n\nKris and Corey met in Ibiza in 2014 and have been inseparable ever since. While they maintain a private romance, they occasionally share sweet sentiments on social media and even released a family holiday card together in 2022.\n\nCorey has also been a regular on ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ and continues to appear on ‘The Kardashians.’\n\nKris has consistently praised Corey for his unwavering support both personally and professionally. In a 2021 interview with WSJ. Magazine, she called him an “amazing support system.”\n\nIn July 2022, she described him to PEOPLE, “I think Corey is super. He's an amazing guy,” she said, adding, “He's such a great person to bounce things off of. I really love his point of view on things.”\n\nNew episodes of ‘The Kardashians’ drop Thursdays at 12 a.m. ET on Hulu."
