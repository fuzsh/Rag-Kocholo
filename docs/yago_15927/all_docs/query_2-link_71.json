        "text": "Kris Jenner and longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble have had an unshakeable bond ever since the pair began dating in 2014. But are Kris and Corey still together today?\n\nKris and Corey appear to still be a blissful couple as of August 2023. That month, Kris’ daughter Kim Kardashian gushed over their romance by sharing a throwback photo from the night they met to her Instagram Stories, writing, “My mom met @coreygamble this night! So happy for that and happy for our tans and lots of make up! LOL #2014.”\n\nCorey sent split rumors flying in January 2023, though, when he was spotted out to dinner in Los Angeles with LA Rams coach Sean McVay and his wife, Veronika Khomyn. Kris was not present for the evening. Fans also speculated whether Kris and Corey were still together after the talent manager didn’t attend Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker‘s wedding in Italy on May 22, 2022. Nevertheless, Kris and Corey enjoyed their own European getaway one month later, proving that their love was still going strong while setting sail on the Amalfi coast.\n\n“Beautiful week sailing the Amalfi Coast with @coreygamble,” Kris wrote in the caption of a photo of the pair on a boat, with both rocking floral patterns.\n\nPrior to Kourtney and Travis’ wedding, they were the picture of happiness during a Valentine’s Day party on February 14, 2022, where she hosted pals Lori Loughlin, Kym Douglas and billionaire Tammy Hughes Gustavson for dinner at her home. Corey posed along with the ladies for an Instagram photo, smiling as he could be seen behind Kris’ left shoulder.\n\nThe momager has mused in the past about why she hasn’t tied the knot with Corey. In a 2017 appearance on close pal Ellen DeGeneres‘ daytime talk show, Kris said about marriage, “You know, I’ve done that twice and it didn’t work out so well. So, I don’t know. You never know … I’m going to take a page out of Goldie [Hawn] and Kurt’s [Russell] book … You know, I just think as long as things are going so well, why ruffle it up?” Kris and her husband of 22 years, Caitlyn Jenner, announced their split in October 2013, a year before she began dating Corey.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians alum opened up about her longtime romance with Corey during a March 2021 interview with WSJ Magazine. “He’s the greatest guy, and he’s just an amazing support system for me,” Kris gushed.\n\nEven her daughter Kylie Jenner has had kind words about her mom’s partner. “I love Corey. I think that he’s just an amazing person, I think he treats my mom amazing,” the Kylie Cosmetics founder shared during an episode of KUWTK. “And he’s just helped me navigate through life and I really appreciate his advice. He’s just always been a good, good guy.”\n\nCorey raved about “decades of love” ahead between himself and Kris in a November 2021 Instagram post while wishing the Kar-Jenner family matriarch a happy 66th birthday. Next to a photo carousel featuring some of their most fashionable date nights he wrote, “Happpppppy Birthday my beautiful queen!! Love you deep babe. Cheers to the best mother and more decades of love and good health with u @krisjenner.”\n\nIn September 2022, the famous momager agreed that Corey is “husband material” during an appearance on The Late Late show With James Corden.\n\n“Yes, he is. He’s the best,” Kris said."
