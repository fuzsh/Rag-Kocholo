        "text": "Kris Jenner has sparked rumors she’s engaged to longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble after flashing a massive diamond ring on social media.\n\nThe momager posted a photo of her ring finger adorned with the huge sparkler on her Instagram Story earlier this week in honor of Valentine’s Day, and let the picture do the talking instead of adding a caption.\n\nRushing over to Reddit, confused fans had mixed reactions to the meaning of the ring.\n\nOne person wrote, “Did you see Kris’ latest Instagram story? A new ring from him? Engaged?”\n\n“I was thinking engagement,” another wrote, before a third added, “A Kris wedding sounds like fun content for the show.”\n\nThe mom of six has yet to speak out on the speculation.\n\nPage Six has reached out to the pair’s reps for comment. Jenner, 67, who has worn massive diamonds on her hands before, shared a series of snaps from her romantic Valentine’s Day with her beau, consisting of flowers and Champagne.\n\nThe ring, which featured a simple band with clear-cut stone sitting proudly in the center, is estimated to be worth over $1.2 million, Kyron Keogh, Managing Director and Co-founder of ROX tells Page Six Style.\n\nThe jewelry expert says the ring is a heart cut of approximately 10 carats.\n\n“Fit for Kardashian royalty, Kris Jenner’s ring is the picture of romance, and looks like a heart cut of approximately 10 carats, with baguette diamonds on either side,” the expert adds.\n\n“Heart-cut diamonds are one of the most sought-after diamond shapes and are becoming increasingly popular amongst fiancés-to-be who are not afraid to stand out.”\n\nMike Fried, CEO of The Diamond Pro, agrees that Jenner’s “enormous” sparkler must be “close to 10 carats.”\n\n“A heart diamond in this carat weight is incredibly rare and comes with an enormous price tag,” he tells Page Six Style.\n\n“What stands out the most, though, is the unique cut and carefully designed ring. Most celebrities choose a round-cut or an oval-cut stone. This ring is a true nod to Kris as a trendsetter and someone who doesn’t mind standing out from the crowd. Heart-shaped diamonds also represent endless love and dedication in a relationship.”\n\nThe duo, who have been dating since 2014, were last year rumored to be secretly married after her daughter Khloé Kardashian noticed her wearing a diamond ring on that finger.\n\n“I’ve heard from so many people that you’re secretly married,” Khloé, 37, tells her mom in an episode of Hulu’s “The Kardashians,” to which Jenner replied with a giggle, “No, I’m not secretly married.”\n\nAfter noticing Jenner with a massive ring, Khloé pressed her mom more.\n\n“Stop,” Jenner added. “You think I’m gonna get married and not have a big ass party? No, Khloé, I’m not secretly married. I swear to God, on all my kids and daddy.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear if the pair are engaged at this time, Jenner and Gamble, 42, do live together in a lavish Calabasas mansion, located next door to Khloé’s.\n\nJenner previously gushed over her man’s “protective side,” saying he “takes care of everything” at the house and essentially acts as the “head of security.”"
