        "text": "Kris Jenner has hinted she will soon be making her way down the aisle as she admitted she's open to getting married to Corey Gamble.\n\nThe 68-year-old, who has been divorced twice, previously insisted she has \"no marriage plans\", but it seems a recent health scare has caused her to have a change of heart. Kris was told she would have to have her ovaries removed after doctors found a tumor.\n\nAs she shared the scary news with her pals Kathy Hilton and Faye Resnick, Kris admitted she's open to getting married when she turns 70. The women sat down for a heart-to-heart in the latest episode of The Kardashians after a visit to Saks Fifth Avenue as Kris explained: \"Tomorrow morning at six o’clock in the morning, I'm gonna have a hysterectomy.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Kylie Jenner fans call her 'out of control' and beg Kardashian star to 'lay off face tune'\n\nREAD MORE: Kendall Jenner poses completely nude in racy snap after rekindling Bad Bunny romance\n\nKris added: \"It started out as just getting some ovaries removed and then today I got a phone call. Dr A, she goes, 'Listen, I really think the best thing for you is to remove the whole thing, do the complete hysterectomy and not give anything a chance to grow anywhere, so no ovarian cancer'.\"\n\nKathy and Faye were very supportive of their friend as they insisted she had nothing to worry about. They then joked they thought she was going to drop an even bigger bombshell.\n\nKathy said: \"I thought you were gonna tell me you're getting married!\" Kris laughed as she replied: \"I mean, not right this very second.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nKathy joked: \"I thought you were gonna say, 'At six in the morning...' like, that's a little early for me to be dressed. What are we wearing?\" Kris then revealed she would want her friends to be her bridesmaids.\n\n\"Dressed and ready to go as a bridesmaid,\" she said. Kathy was delighted by the offer as she replied: \"As a bridesmaid, for sure.\" Kris then settled things as she said: \"I mean, you guys could totally be bridesmaids when I get married. Okay, so maybe when I’m 70.\"\n\nIf Kris married Corey, it wouldn't be her first wedding. She was married to Robert Kardashian for 13 years until her affair with Todd Waterman was exposed and ended their romance. Kris later married former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner in 1991 before they split in 2013."
