        "text": "Kris Jenner spends much of her time problem-solving her children's non-stop drama and single-handedly managing pretty much every member of her family. But when she's not dealing with all those shenanigans, Kris spends time with her long-time boyfriend Corey Gamble! Korey (a shipper name I just invented because no one bothered to do it before me) goes back all the way to 2014, a simpler time when the words \"dolce vita wedding\" didn't make us shudder in fear. Let's get into it.\n\nAugust 2014\n\nOtherwise known as the fateful month Kris and Corey met. The place? Ibiza. The time? Who knows, but probably true love o'clock. The location? Fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday party, where all fairytale love stories begin.\n\nNovember 7, 2014\n\nCorey pops up at Kris' birthday party, and this truly outstanding photo—nay, work of art—is taken:\n\nMarch 23, 2015\n\nNext, Corey shows up on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and he and Kris basically spend an entire episode making sweet love all over the house—completely traumatizing Kim Kardashian in the process. \"The bed, like, bangs up against the wall,\" she tells her family in horror. \"And I was literally trying to pass out and I, like, woke up and I swear I thought I heard moaning.\"\n\nApril 5, 2015\n\nCorey and Kris are spotted attending an Easter church service together. You know what they say: The couple that prays together, stays together. Or something.\n\nApril 23, 2015\n\nCorey and Kris make their relationship Instagram official when they post pics from their double date with (LOL) Billy Ray and Trish Cyrus:\n\nMay 2, 2016\n\nKris brings Corey as her date to the Met Gala! And they look very fancy!\n\nJune 26, 2017\n\nPeople publishes claims from a source alleging that \"Kris is basically [Corey's] sugar mama,\" the \"relationship is more business than romantic,\" and finally, that \"they will never get married.\" All of which is, wow, RUDE, and clearly untrue considering their vibes keep on keeping on.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nRumors surface that Kris and Corey have broken up thanks to the below Instagram from Kim, which she originally captioned, \"Caption this.... mine is SWF.\" (She then changes the caption to \"Caption this...\")\n\nJanuary 15, 2018\n\nAn episode of KUWTK airs where Kris is caught between Corey and Khloé Kardashian, who apparently aren't getting along super well. \"I like all of y’all, but y’all are girls,\" Corey says. \"I’m a dude and I know how that shit can go.

I’m in a really great relationship right now, and I’m happy and I don’t want to mess that up. I don’t have the need to put on a long, white dress and walk down an aisle. I’ve done that. I’ve had the big wedding, I’ve had the babies and the kids—six of them, by the way. It’s not like we need to do that again; my body wouldn’t cooperate if I wanted it to. I think that I just feel really grateful and blessed for my past experiences and I’m looking forward to my future and I just don’t think that I want to go there.\"\n\nNovember 5, 2018\n\nKris and Corey celebrate her birthday with a cuddly Instagram photo.\n\nMay 6, 2019\n\nIt's the Met Gala and the theme is CAMP, bb:\n\nOctober 1, 2019\n\nKris and Corey hit up Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber's wedding (obviously, celeb photo booths were absolutely peaking during this era).\n\nNovember 10, 2019\n\nAnd then they arrive looking v fancy at the People's Choice Awards:\n\nNovember 5, 2020\n\nCorey celebrates Kris' birthday, writing in part, \"I LOVE U so much young sexy ❤️ 💜 it’s your day my lady.\" Ooookay!\n\nApril 1, 2021\n\nKris and Corey's extreme horniness has Kourtney Kardasian attempt to get them to do a celibacy trial.
