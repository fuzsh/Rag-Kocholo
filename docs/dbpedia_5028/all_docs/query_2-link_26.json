        "text": "Eskişehir, Turkey, Tuesday 9 April 2022\n\nPsychology, not one of my strengths, is a topic on my mind these days.\n\nI find myself from time to time in the midst of psychological conflict with a wife who cannot comprehend that my search for personal happiness cannot revolve around being with her constantly, that I must be fulfilled in all the roles a man must do, besides husband.\n\nI am engaged in mental battle with a colleague at work in Eskişehir who desires me to humble myself and apologize to her for a wrong I neither meant nor directed at her.\n\nI am reading Orhan Pamuk’s The Museum of Innocence slowly and minutely, finding myself disturbed by the plot therein.\n\nI find myself remembering an evening meeting at the school with a student who is a psychiatrist by trade.\n\nI had great difficulty in sticking to the script of my Encounter (the Wall Street English name for the language elicitation sessions we have) and found myself quizzing her as to the nature of her profession:\n\nWhat was most difficult about her job?\n\nWhat was most fulfilling about her job?\n\nHow did her job affect her personal life?\n\nAs a father figure to most of the people with whom I am acquainted with in Eskişehir I find myself a witness and councillor to the relationships they are engaged in.\n\nSomehow they equate age with wisdom.\n\nThough it is true that I know a thing or two because I have seen a thing or two, this does in no way negate the application of the adage “no fool like an old fool” to my character.\n\nA friend has confessed to me their struggle between the desires of the day and the longings for tomorrow.\n\nThere is a romance here, but is there a future here?\n\nThere may be a future out there, but will there be romance over there?\n\nTough call.\n\nTough decision.\n\nA hard choice between two uncertainties.\n\nThe “out there” is presently focused on Vietnam where potential employment awaits.\n\nAll I know of Vietnam is that which I read.\n\nMy experience with the ‘Nam is limited to the perspective of my friend Swiss Miss (Heidi Hoi) and her time spent there.\n\nBut perhaps the experience of my Swiss friend might be instructive for my Eskişehir friend?\n\nThus I return to Heidi‘s story…..\n\nSa Pa, Vietnam, March 2019\n\nSa Pa is a mountain town – home to a great diversity of ethnic minority peoples.\n\nIf you were expecting a quaint alpine town, recalibrate your expectations.\n\nModern tourism development has seen Sapa’s skyline continually thrust upwards.\n\nBut you’re not here to hang out in town.\n\nThis is northern Vietnam’s premier trekking base, from where hikers launch themselves into a surrounding countryside of cascading rice terraces and tiny hill-tribe villages that seem a world apart.\n\nOnce you’ve stepped out into the lush fields, you’ll understand the Sapa area’s real charm.\n\nMost of the ethnic minority people work their land on sloping terraces since the vast majority of the land is mountainous.\n\nTheir staple foods are rice and corn.\n\nRice, by its very nature of being a labour-intensive crop, makes the daily fight for survival paramount.\n\nThe unique climate in Sa Pa has a major influence on the ethnic minorities who live in the area.\n\nWith sub-tropical summers, temperate winters and 160 days of mist annually, the influence on agricultural yields and health-related issues is significant.\n\nThe geographical location of the area makes it a truly unique place for many interesting plants and animals, allowing it to support many inhabitants.\n\nMany very rare or even endemic species have been recorded in the region.\n\nThe scenery of the Sa Pa region in large part reflects the relationship between the minority people and nature.\n\nThis is seen especially in the paddy fields carpeting the rolling lower slopes of the Hoàng Lién Mountains.\n\nThe impressive physical landscape which underlies this has resulted from the work of the elements over thousands of years, wearing away the underlying rock.\n\nOn a clear day – (it does happen) – the imposing peak of Fan Si Pan comes into view.\n\nThe last major peak in the Himalayan chain, Fan Si Pan offers a real challenge to even the keenest walker, the opportunity of staggering views, and a rare glimpse of some of the last remaining primary rain forest in Vietnam.\n\nGeology, climate and human activity have combined to produce a range of very distinct habitats around Sa Pa.\n\nEspecially important is Sa Pa’s geographic position, at the convergence of the world’s 14 “biomes” (distinct biographic areas), producing an assemblage of plant and animal species unique in the world.\n\nIn 2014, Sa Pa ranked #9 in the top 10 rice terrace destinations of the world by Spot Cool Stuff.\n\nThe best time to take great photos of the yellow rice terraces in Sapa is September.\n\nOccasionally, thick white snow is recorded in Sapa in winter (December to February), giving adventurous travellers a rare chance to admire snow-capped mountains.\n\nIt is a one-of-a-lifetime experience in a tropical country like Vietnam.\n\nThe Hoàng Lién Mountains are home to a rich variety of plants, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects, many only found in northwestern Vietnam.\n\nFor this reason, the Hoàng Lién Nature Reserve was made a National Park in 2006.\n\nHoàng Lién covers much of the mountain range to the immediate south of Sa Pa.\n\nForest type and quality change with increasing altitude.\n\nAt 2,000 meters the natural, undisturbed forest begins to be seen.\n\nAbove 2,500 meters dwarf conifers and rhododendrons predominate in the harsh “elfin forest“, (so called because a lack of topsoil and nutrients means that fully mature trees grow to measure only a few meters in height).\n\nHigher still, only the hardiest of plant species are found.\n\nAt over 3,000 meters, Fan Si Pan’s summit can only support dwarf bamboo.\n\nAround 7 million minority people (nearly 2/3 of Vietnam’s total minority population) live in the northern uplands, mostly in isolated villages.\n\nThe largest ethnic groups are Thai and Muong in the northwest, Tay and Nung in the northeast and Hmong and Dao dispersed throughout the region.\n\nHistorically, all these peoples migrated from southern China at various times throughout history:\n\nThose who arrived first, notably the Tay and Thai, settled in the fertile valleys where they now lead a relatively prosperous existence, while late arrivals, such as the Hmong and Dao, took to living on the higher slopes.\n\nDespite government efforts to integrate them into the Vietnamese community, most continue to follow a way of life that has changed very little over the centuries.\n\nFor an insight into the minorities’ traditional cultures and highly varied styles of dress, visit Hanoi’s informative Museum of Ethnology before setting off into the mountains.\n\nTo get in shape for a trek through the valley, try taking a short but steep hike to the top of Ham Rong Mountain, which overlooks the town from an elevation of around 2,000 metres.\n\nStone steps lead up to the peak where there are fine panoramic views on a clear day.\n\nThe pathway is lined with potted orchids, landscaped gardens and depictions of cartoon characters like Mickey Mouse.\n\nTo find the entrance to the park, follow Ham Rong to the north of the church in the town centre.\n\nVietnam’s highest mountain, Fan Si Pan (3143m) lies less than 5 km as the crow flies from Sa Pa, but it’s an arduous three- to five-day round trip on foot.\n\nThe usual route starts by descending 300 metres to cross the Muong Hoa River and then climbs almost 2,000 metres on overgrown paths through pine forest and bamboo thickets before emerging on the southern ridge.\n\nThe reward is a panorama encompassing the mountain ranges of northwest Vietnam, south to Son La Province and north to the peaks of Yunnan in China.\n\nAbove: Mount Fan Si Pan\n\nAlthough it is a hard climb, the most difficult aspect of Fan Si Pan is its climate:\n\nEven in the most favourable months of November and December it is difficult to predict a stretch of settled clear weather and many people are forced back by cloud, rain and cold.\n\nSetting on top highlight destinations in the Sapa travel guide for adventurous travellers, Fansipan Mount is not only the highest peak in all of Vietnam but also the “roof of the Indochina peninsula”.\n\nThe actual trek boasts breathtaking panoramic views of majestic mountains, lush valleys and dense forests, challenging both amateur and professional hikers.\n\nAbove: The roof of Indochina\n\nThe pristine and rustic beauty of the Cave of Fairies enchants thousands of travellers from the very first glimpse of an eye.\n\nThe emerald waters of the Chay River surrounded by high cliffs turns this limestone cave into a heavenly corner on earth with charming scenery.\n\nThe Cave of Fairies looks like something straight out of a Brothers Grimm fairy tale.\n\nPerching on the peak of Tram Ton pass on the Hoang Lien Son mountain range is Heaven’s Gate.\n\nAbout 18 kilometers to the north of Sapa, it boasts a great view looking over the valleys between Fansipan, the roof of Indochina Peninsula.\n\nAs its name reveals, this destination brings a little feeling of Heaven with a sublime scenery featuring majestic mountains and extreme abyss.\n\nSetting foot on Heaven’s Gate to grasp the beautiful scenery of the winding pass roads below will be an unforgettable memory for newcomers to Sapa.\n\nA guide is essential to trace indistinct paths, hack through bamboo and locate water sources if climbing Mount Fan Si Pan.\n\nHmong guides are said to know the mountain best.\n\nSa Pa hotels and tour agents can arrange guides and porters as required.\n\nA popular, hassle-free way to visit minority villages is to join one of the organized trips offered by tour agencies in Hanoi, Sa Pa, Bac Ha and Ha Giang.\n\nGenerally, you are better off going with local companies as they are more familiar with the villages visited.\n\nWhile it is possible to go alone to places like Cat Cat near Sa Pa, independent trekking is generally frowned upon and locals may not be as welcoming as they are to groups.\n\nWith typical wooden houses, flowing streams, elaborate brocades, and hospitable ethnic people, the enchanting Cat Cat is the most beautiful ancient village in Sapa.\n\nBeing the home to the Hmong ethnic group, this little hamlet is where local inhabitants retain the cultivation of flax and cotton with a long-standing tradition of weaving beautiful brocade fabrics.\n\nDrop by the village, you can learn about one-of-a-kind customs and practices of Hmong through their local life as well as get an insight into their traditional culture while enjoying the local hospitality.\n\nAbove: Cat Cat, Vietnam\n\nBehaviour that we take for granted may cause offence to some ethnic minority people –\n\nRemember that you are a guest.\n\nApart from being sensitive to the situation and keeping an open mind, the following rules should be observed when visiting the ethnic minority areas.\n\nDress modestly, in long trousers or a skirt, in a T-shirt or shirt.\n\nBe sensitive when taking photographs, particularly of older people who are generally suspicious of the camera – always ask permission first.\n\nOnly enter a house when you’ve been invited, and be prepared to remove your shoes.\n\nSmall gifts, such as fresh fruit from the local market, are always welcome, and it’s also a good idea to buy craftwork produced by the villagers – most communities have some embroidery, textiles or basketry for sale.\n\nAs a mark of respect, learn the local terms of address, either in a dialect or at least in Vietnamese, such as chao ong, chao ba.\n\nTry to minimize your impact on the fragile local environment: take litter back to the towns with you and be sensitive when using wood and other scarce resources.\n\nHiking and enjoying nature is the name of the game in Sapa.\n\nThe most prominent attraction in the area around Sapa is Fan Si Pan, which is the highest mountain in Vietnam.\n\nIt’s only 19km from town.\n\nThis may seem like a short distance, but the trek is not easy.\n\nThe rough terrain and unpredictable weather present some difficulties.\n\nTourists who are fit and have mountain climbing experience will enjoy this attraction the most as the peak is accessible all year round.\n\nTechnical climbing skills are not necessary, but endurance is a must.\n\nTowering above Sapa are the Hoang Lien Mountains, once known to the French as the Tonkinese Alps and now a National Park.\n\nThese mountains include the often-cloud-obscured Fansipan (3,143 metres), Vietnam’s highest peak, regularly dubbed ‘the Roof of Indochina‘.\n\nFansipan’s wild, lonesome beauty has been somewhat shattered with the opening of a 6,292-metre-long cable car, taking people across the Muong Hoa Valley and up to near the summit in 15 minutes.\n\nBuy tickets at the ticket office in Sapa’s main square, from where a funicular train (50,000 VND return) shuttles passengers to the lower cable-car station.\n\nAfter the cable-car ride you still face 600 steps to the summit, or you can take another funicular (70,000 VND one way) from Do Quyen, passing a series of pagodas and Buddhas to the summit.\n\nExpect crowds or clouds, depending on the weather.\n\nFan Si Pan can be found in Hoàng Lién National Park, which is an attraction in itself.\n\nThe park covers a picturesque mountain landscape and several forests, and serves as the habitat for a diverse set of animals.\n\nSome species can only be found in northwest Vietnam and are highly endangered.\n\nNature lovers will truly appreciate this park.\n\nOther attractions that are part of the Hoang Lien National Park include the Cat Cat Village and the Ta Phin Village and cave.\n\nTrekking is the main activity in Sapa.\n\nTrekking maps are available from the Tourist Information Centre on Fansipan Street.\n\nThese maps are invaluable if you want to trek around the area without a guide.\n\nThey show the walking trails and trekking routes around town.\n\nMost hotels in Sapa offer tourists guided half-day and day long treks, but the best places to inquire about these treks are the Cha Pa Garden, Auberge Hotel, Cat Cat View Hotel and Mountain View Hotel.\n\nWhile it is possible to go hiking around Sapa on your own, it is better to have the assistance of a guide to guarantee a more enriching experience.\n\nWhen it comes to longer treks or overnight stays in the villages, the knowledge of a local will come in handy.\n\nRegardless of being on a walking tour or not, tribal women will walk with you and try to assist you in any possible way hoping for a tip.\n\nThe road between Sapa and Lai Chau crosses the Tram Ton Pass on the northern side of Mount Fan Si Pan, 15 km from Sapa.\n\nAt 1,900 metres it is Vietnam’s highest mountain pass and acts as a dividing line between two climatic zones.\n\nThe lookout points here have fantastic views in clear weather.\n\nOn the Sapa side it is often cold and foggy, but drop a few hundred metres onto the Lai Chau side and it can be sunny and warm.\n\nSurprisingly, while Sapa is the coldest place in Vietnam, Lai Chau can be one of the warmest.\n\nMost people also stop at 100-metre-high Thac Bac (Silver Waterfall, admission 20,000 VND), 12 km from Sapa.\n\nA one-way/return xe om here costs 80,000/150,000 dong.\n\nTourists who want to learn something new can go on community-based tours to Sin Chai, a Hmong village.\n\nOn most tours, overnight stays are arranged so people can learn about textiles, or tribal music and dance.\n\nThis is what they came for.\n\nMost visitors come to Sa Pa to trek to minority villages in the Muong Hoa Valley, which separates Sa Pa from Mount Fan Si Pan.\n\nUntil 2016, only a few hardy trekkers each year were successful in scaling Vietnam’s highest peak, but thousands now head there each day thanks to the completion of a controversial 7km, three-wire cable car from Sa Pa to the top.\n\nStretching 6,292 metres, Fansipan Legend is the longest three-wire cable car in the world.\n\nIts altitude gain of 1,410 metres is also the world’s highest for a three-rope cable car.\n\nThough this enormous project (costing $210 million) was strongly criticized by environmentalists for threatening the continued existence of rare species of flora and fauna, most visitors find it an exciting experience.\n\nGondolas hold up to 30 people.\n\nThe journey up takes around 20 minutes and offers eye-popping views of rice terraces in the valley, churning rivers, waterfalls and dense woodland near the summit.\n\nUnfortunately, the summit itself is cloaked in cloud more often than not, but there is still no shortage of visitors queuing to snap a selfie at the top.\n\nThere are souvenir shops and restaurants at the lower and upper terminals.\n\nTake a couple of layers to put on when you get out of the cable car at the top.\n\nAllow a few hours at the top and be prepared to stand in long queues to get on board at weekends.\n\nBut I don’t recommend this.\n\nInstead, walk.\n\nFor walking has a multitude of amateurs.\n\nEveryone walks.\n\nIt is an activity that requires openness, engagement and few expenses.\n\nWhile walking, the body and the mind work together, so that thinking becomes almost a physical rhythmic act.\n\n“Isn’t it really quite extraordinary to see that, since Man took his first step, no one has asked himself why he walks, how he walks, if he has ever walked, if he could walk better, what he achieves in walking – questions that are tied to all the philosophical, psychological and political systems which preoccupy the world.”\n\n(Honoré de Balzac, Theorie de la Demarche)\n\nFor Heidi, there was a joy to finding that her body was adequate to get her where she was going.\n\nIt was a gift to develop a more tangible, concrete relationship to her neighbourhood and its residents.\n\nOn the trail there is a more stately sense of time one has afoot.\n\nOn public transit, where things must be planned and scheduled beforehand, everything feels rushed and ruined.\n\nThere is a sense of place that can only be gained on foot.\n\nToo many people nowadays live in a series of interiors – home, car, gym, office, shops, cable car – disconnected from one another.\n\nOn foot everything stays connected, for while walking one occupies the spaces between these interiors in the same way one occupies these interiors.\n\nOne lives in the whole world rather than in interiors built up against it.\n\nFrom Rebecca Solnit’s Wanderlust: A History of Walking:\n\n“I had told Sono about an ad I found in the Los Angeles Times a few months ago that I had been thinking about ever since.\n\nIt was for a CD-ROM encyclopedia and the text that occupied a whole page read:\n\n“You used to walk across town in the pouring rain to use our encyclopedia.\n\nWe are pretty confident that we can get your kid to click and drag.“\n\nI think it was the kid’s walk in the rain that constituted the real education, at least of the senses and the imagination.\n\nIt is the unpredictable incidents between official events that add up to a life, the incalculable that give it value.\n\nThe random, the unscreened, allows you to find what you don’t know you are looking for.\n\nYou don’t know a place until it surprises you.\n\nWalking is one way of maintaining a bulwark against this erosion of the mind, the body, the landscape.\n\nEvery walker is a guard on patrol to protect the ineffable.\n\nWhen you give yourself to places, they give you yourself back.\n\nThe more one comes to know them, the more one seeds them with the invisible crop of memories and associations that will be waiting for you when you come back, while new places offer up new thoughts, new possibilities.\n\nExploring the world is one of the best ways of exploring the mind.\n\nWalking travels both terrains.“\n\nCertainly, Heidi could have ascended in comfort, speed and predictability up to the summit of Mount Fan Si Pan.\n\nCertainly, she could have gazed upon the ground below like some Olympian goddess, but doing so the senses are denied forests of huge trees that rise above, plants and animals caressing the Earth that gave them life, all things that are beautiful about existence.\n\nIf you are looking for a true adventure in Sapa, skip the cable car and venture into the lush forests of Fan Si Pan.\n\nA good traveller has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving.\n\nLao Tzu, Tao Te Ching\n\nMy advice to the younger generation is:\n\nLearn to relax and find meaning in the experience.\n\nWhen you let go of the haste of normal life, it teaches you truths about yourself you had no idea you longed to know.\n\nAmble out into the world at the whim of your curiosity, search for meaning, and follow whatever sparks your sense of adventure along the way.\n\nLife is boundless and therefore fragmentary.\n\nIt is our imagination that brings meaning to these fragments, that gives these fragments a unity called Life.\n\nAll days are difficult.\n\nThe point is to find enough hope to get through the day.\n\nHope must be sought, discovered.\n\nWalking is that quest for hope.\n\nWriting is my expression of that quest for hope.\n\nWhile it is possible to wander into the Muong Hoa Valley, pass through a couple of minority villages and return to Sa Pa in a day, for the full-on Sa Pa trekking experience you will want to overnight in a home-stay and get to know something about your hosts.\n\nThe cost to enter most villages is 50,000 dong, though this is included in the price of organized treks.\n\nExpect to pay $60 per day per person for these, depending on the number of people in the group.\n\nIt is important to wear the right clothing when walking in these mountains:\n\nStrong ankle support are the best footwear, though you can get away with training shoes in the dry season.\n\nChoose thin, loose clothing.\n\nLong trousers offer some protection from thorns and leeches.\n\nWear a hat and sunblock.\n\nTake plenty of water.\n\nCarry a basic medical kit.\n\nIf you plan on spending a night in a village, you will need warm clothing as temperatures can drop to around freezing.\n\nYou might want to take a sleeping bag, mosquito net and food, though these are usually provided on organized tours.\n\nFinally, aggressive dogs can be a problem when entering villages, so it is a good idea to carry a strong stick when trekking.\n\nAlways be watchful for the venomous snakes that are common in this area.\n\nThe French first developed Sa Pa town, the gateway to the region, as a hill station and cool summer escape from Hanoi’s oppressive heat.\n\nTheir dominance in the area didn’t last long, though.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Vietnamese independence fighters drove the colonists from the region, but not before the French bombed Sa Pa town, leaving nothing but ruins behind them.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1990s that redevelopment began in earnest and tourists started to flock back to the region.\n\nNow, trekking in Sa Pa is one of the biggest tourist activities in Vietnam.\n\nSa Pa town is the very definition of “tacky tourist town”, with hotels, happy hour signs and souvenir shops obliterating anything real, but Heidi has enjoyed waking up this morning to the quiet beauty of Sa Pa.\n\nSa Pa town is a crazy tourist trap with hundreds of guest houses offering happy hour cocktails and $5 beds.\n\nA great place if drinking cheap cocktails with hordes of other tourists is your idea of a good time.\n\nWalk along the maze of streets.\n\nVenture into the Sa Pa Market to try fried banana, corn or sweet potato cake, or grilled fresh sweet potato or grilled corn sold by street vendors as an appetizer.\n\nIf you are brave enough, try a grilled balut (put one balut on a cup, make a hole on top of the balut, add marinade and enjoy.\n\nWalk further through small alleys where you can try different kinds of grilled sticks and rolls (beef, fish, pork or seafood on a stick or roll in mustard greens) and several glasses of inexpensive draft beer.\n\nOr get a seat in a local restaurant, order a fresh salmon from local salmon farms in Sapa or sturgeon and let your chef to perform his skill.\n\nSalmon hotpot is perfect on a cool evening.\n\nAlthough still beautiful and highly recommended visiting, Sa Pa is no longer the peaceful hill town it once was.\n\nMany local stores have been replaced by stores selling items visitors need and want because it is more profitable for the local store owners.\n\nThe streets are narrow, with many vans carrying visitors in and out, those same visitors walking the streets, and construction of new hotels contributing to the congestion.\n\nIt can be a bit chaotic.\n\nSo in Sa Pa town don’t expect unspoiled wilderness.\n\nAt the Sa Pa market, a tiny Hmong woman dressed in traditional clothing is waiting for Heidi.\n\nShe is the trekking guide, Mama of the Mountains.\n\nThe Hmong, known in China for centuries under the name Miao, used to be called Méo in Southeast Asia.\n\nTheir number is about three million and they are scattered over a vast territory stretching from southwest China (2 million) to North Vietnam (600,000), Laos (about 250,000), Thailand (150,000) and Myanmar (formerly Burma) (about 30,000).\n\nThey have been members of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2007.\n\nThe Hmong are easy to identify because of their red costume.\n\nIn the market food court, Heidi is given a bowl of tofu noodle soup for breakfast.\n\nIt is possibly vegetarian, though the piles of mystery meat on every table in the market do make visitors wonder.\n\nNourishment being the priority, Heidi slurps up the salty sour soup while her tour companions arrive in small, yawning groups.\n\nAfter breakfast, the gang who had gathered to go trekking in Sapa splits into two groups and they set off up the backstreets and alleyways rising out of Sapa town.\n\nAfter five minutes of hill climbing in the searing heat, everyone is drenched in sweat and panting hard.\n\nAfter half an hour, everyone is questioning their life choices.\n\nHeidi views her guide with great scepticism.\n\nMama – that’s what the guide insists her group calls her – is half Heidi‘s height, her English broken, her back slightly bent, her tone that will not suffer fools, but her smile is infectious.\n\nTo give the guide her credit, she knows exactly when to stop to prevent fainting or major heart trauma.\n\nAs they reach the day’s first real rest break, exposing a dramatic view of Sapa town far below, the clouds roll in and rain starts to drip out of the sky.\n\nNobody minds.\n\nEveryone is hot and sticky and happy for the free shower.\n\nThe shower turns into a proper rain storm.\n\nSapa is home to Vietnam’s highest peak, Fan Si Pan, which tickles the clouds 3,143 metres above sea level, keeping watch over the terraced rice paddies that line Sapa’s steep valley walls.\n\nHome to several ethnic minorities, chiefly the Hmong, the Dao and the Dai, Sapa has been attracting trekkers since the early 1900s.\n\nThey walk slowly along a small local path leading into the bottom of the valley, where some stalls are available that serve tea and fruits:\n\nA perfect spot to take a rest and have lunch.\n\nAbove: The village of Lao Chai\n\nAfter lunch, they visit the Tay people of Ta Van, which lies in the middle of the Muong Hoa Valley.\n\nThe Tay, who have been present in Vietnam from the beginning, are a branch of the Tay-Thai group.\n\nIn Sa Pa, the Tay ethnic group is concentrated in some southern communities, such as Ho village, Nam Sai village and Thanh Phu village.\n\nIt is easy to distinguish the Tay from other ethnic groups because their clothing is very different and has only one colour, dark indigo.\n\nThey check in a local homestay for overnight.\n\nThe local hostess prepares dinner.\n\nDuring dinner, Heidi tries to talk with them to understand more about their local life and thought.\n\n“More rice?\n\nMore rice?\n\nHave more rice?\n\nHave more rice!”\n\nIt wasn’t a question so much as a command — a very forceful command from their homestay host.\n\nShe had been around the entire table of trekkers twice already, wielding her plastic rice paddle like a sword.\n\nAfter a meal that consists of great mountains of tofu, pumpkin, green beans, bean sprouts, mushroom stir fry and, for the carnivores in the group, fried pork, more rice is exactly what Heidi didn’t want.\n\nWhen it was her turn to get third helpings, Heidi stretched her arms as far away from the tiny hostess and her plastic rice paddle as she could get.\n\n“No,” Heidi laughs.\n\n“No, I won’t eat it!”\n\nA minute later, after she thought had escaped, another half-cup of rice has been plopped it into her bowl.\n\nAt each meal, local women come around to sell their handmade bags, scarves and jewelry.\n\nEven though Heidi isn’t interested, it doesn’t hurt to be friendly, make eye contact, and smile.\n\nThe vendors persist in showing her each item they have in their bags, so whether Heidi is friendly or not — she might as well make it a pleasant experience for everyone involved.\n\nThe native hill tribe women have learned that following trekkers and city walkers selling local crafts is a great business model.\n\nSo it is best to expect and embrace it as part of the culture, while politely declining if you are not interested, or purchasing/donating if you are inclined.\n\nThe local people are genuine and very friendly if you get to know them beyond their sales.\n\nLocal hill tribe women wear traditional dress, not as much for tourists as it has been their tradition to wear it outside the home for centuries.\n\nIt is not the tradition for men to do so.\n\nAcres and acres of rice paddies line the hillsides, passed down through the family for generations and still cultivated as a primary source of income.\n\nOnce the rice is finally eaten, the rice wine comes out in a much-used plastic 1.5L water bottle.\n\nOnce again, the hostess will not be denied.\n\nThe trekkers and their enthusiastic hostess down shot after shot of the fiery clear liquid, each drink being preceded by a group chant of “Một hai ba, yo!” or “One, two, three, cheers!”.\n\nA messy, drunken evening ensues.\n\nBut the thing about messy drunken evenings at the end of a full day of trekking is that they invariably end early.\n\nEveryone is snugly encamped under mosquito nets by 8:30 pm.\n\nBefore 11 pm, even the most foolhardy drinkers have turned out the lights and snored themselves to sleep.\n\nDreaming of the road ahead.\n\nNot so early the next morning, they gather for a breakfast of thin pancakes with fresh local honey, bananas and fried eggs.\n\nHeidi eats as much as her stomach can hold, knowing another day of heavy exertion lies ahead.\n\nThe large group sets off together, winding their way down through the village and out along a narrow muddy track onto the sparsely forested slopes of the mountain.\n\nThey pass tiny wooden houses where piglets, baby chicks, and puppies play in the dirt.\n\nThere are plenty of village children to meet, too.\n\nSome kids are shy or indifferent to our passing.\n\nOthers shout “Hello!” or come running out for a high five.\n\nSlightly ahead of the group, Heidi spots an adorable girl.\n\n“Xin chao!”, she shouts with a grin.\n\nThe little girl returns Heidi’s smile and her greeting.\n\nWith her mother and brother watching over her, Heidi bends down to say hello again and asks to take her picture.\n\nThe little girl strikes a perfect pose.\n\nThe streamlined group of long-term travellers falls into an easy rhythm as the rice fields and endless purple mountains spread out before them.\n\nToday’s trek is much less hilly and far more satisfying than yesterday’s.\n\nFor a start, the clouds have rolled away and they enjoy spectacular views of the rice fields and orchards along the mountainside.\n\nThey are also further from Sa Pa town, meaning that they meet more locals and fewer tourists.\n\nFinally, Heidi manages to have real conversations.\n\nBetween the quiet minutes of meditative walking, they share their most remarkable travel experiences, their embarrassing moments, their favourite music and their best travel tips.\n\nThey chat about the various study- and volunteer-abroad experiences each of them has had, how they handle pressures from family and friends back home, and their plans (or lack thereof) for the future.\n\nThough Heidi enjoys the occasional party, this is what she was looking for on a group tour:\n\nMeeting like-minded people with interesting observations about the world and their unceasing desire to explore it.\n\nThe village of Giang Ta Chai is the next stop, which we will reach by following a path over a bridge.\n\nLunch is provided near a waterfall, just before arrival at the village.\n\nEventually, the trek returns to the hill above Hau Thao village.\n\nThey continue to trek to the next village of Ban Ho.\n\nThere lives the Tay tribe with their special wooden houses on stilts.\n\nThey overnight in Ban Ho village.\n\nIn the morning after breakfast the group walks around Ban Ho village and then trek to Love Waterfall to relax.\n\nThe final day’s trek is all about making fast tracks back to Sa Pa town.\n\nThey follow a steep road that winds up out of the valley floor, taking them back the way they came.\n\nBeing on the road in a small group means they make quick time, though they still take plenty of breaks to high five the local kids, attempt to cuddle the large puppy population, and have at least one close encounter with a buffalo.\n\nOnce again, they are under the blistering sun for their climb.\n\nA sticky layer of sunscreen, sweat, and rich red dirt envelops them all.\n\nClouds roll in, threatening more rain, but do little to cool the group.\n\nThey stop in a village café near their first night’s homestay for our final lunch of the trip.\n\nIt is a hub for people coming and going from Sapa, so once again Heidi is part of a noisy gang of tourists.\n\nMama shows up to herd the entire café full of trekkers to their various destinations:\n\nSome are getting the 4 pm bus to Hanoi.\n\nOthers are taking the sleeper bus or the train.\n\nStill others are hopping on a bus to Lao, while some are staying another night at the homestay.\n\nThe efficiency and humour Mama displays while arranging this frenzy of activity is a minor miracle.\n\nThe Hmong grow watermelons, oranges, dragon fruit and bananas in orchards around Fan Si Pan.\n\nTourism provides them with new opportunities to earn sustainable salary.\n\nWith that income, they can help their families and their communities.\n\nPut on your trekking boots and step out into the lush green fields of Sapa in Vietnam.\n\nExperience amazing nature brushed with every palette of green.\n\nMeet and engage with the local minority people and immerse yourself into their culture.\n\nPeople often use “Sapa” to describe the entire region, not only the smaller Sapa town of 7,000, a hillside town overlooking the green surrounding ​valleys with views of Fan Si Pan, Vietnam’s highest peak, and the dozens of surrounding villages where 29,000 mostly native minorities have lived for hundreds of years.\n\nThe area saw very few tourists before 1993, when both Vietnamese and foreign tourists started to come to see the beautiful terraced rice paddies, corn fields clinging to the sides of the valleys, the clouds rolling in and out, and to stay and relax in the beautiful countryside.\n\nOf course, in conversations with Mama, Heidi wondered what it must be like to be a woman in Vietnam.\n\nWomen occupy both the domestic and outside sector in contemporary Vietnam.\n\nWomen’s participation in the economy, government, and society has increased.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, little progress has been made to improve gender relations.\n\nTraditional Confucian patriarchal values values have continued to persist, as well as a continued emphasis on the family unit.\n\nThis has comprised the main criticism of Vietnam Women’s Union, an organization that works towards advancing women’s rights.\n\nFurthermore, recent shifts in Vietnam’s sex ratio show an increased number of men outnumbering women, which many researchers have stated to in part be caused by the two-child policy in Vietnam.\n\nConfucianism’s emphasis on the family still impacts Vietnamese women’s lives, especially in rural areas, where it espouses the importance of premarital female virginity and condemns abortion and divorce.\n\nAccording to a 2006 study, over the past decades, little progression in gender relations have been made.\n\nHousehold chores and labour are still primarily performed by Vietnamese women.\n\nHowever, women in Vietnam have shown increased influence in familial decisions, such as household budgets and the education of the children.\n\nIn terms of childcare responsibility, men have shown an increased participation at the earlier ages of childcare, though women overall still bear the main responsibility.\n\nWomen are seen primarily as mothers, and are considered to have shown “respect” to their husband’s lineage if they give birth to a boy.\n\nWhile patrilineal ancestor worship shows girls as “outside lineage” (họ ngoại), it consider boys to be “inside lineage” (họ nội).\n\nVietnamese society tends to follow the ancestral line through males, pushing women to the periphery.\n\nAs aforementioned Vietnam has a two child policy.\n\nSome families want at least one boy, but would prefer two boys to two girls, so they use ultrasound machines to determine the baby’s sex to later abort female offspring.\n\nThe main religion in Vietnam are traditional folk beliefs.\n\nThis is not an organized religion, however it does adopt many Confucian views.\n\nOne of the main views that it takes from Confucius is the Patrilineal Society.\n\nMen are the head of the family and more their lineage is to be protected.\n\nAs it pertains to motherhood, Vietnam women are seen as and used primarily as mothers.\n\nFemale virginity is of extreme importance, especially in rural areas, and the Society condemns abortion and female divorce.\n\nAs said, if a woman wants to show respect to her husband, the best way she can do that is to bear him a son.\n\nThe issue of domestic violence has faced scrutiny in Vietnam.\n\nIn 2007, Vietnamese legislation passed the Law on Prevention and Control Domestic Violence, which reported that 32% of Vietnamese women have suffered sexual violence from their spouses, while 54% of women in Vietnam have suffered from emotional violence.\n\nSpeculation has rose on the viability of divorce as a solution to those in situations of domestic violence.\n\nThis is due to the prevalent local attitudes and measures taken towards preventing divorce in order to preserve the family unit, rather than helping victims escape domestic abuse.\n\nAdditionally, surveys have indicated that 87% of domestic violence victims in Vietnam do not seek support for their situation.\n\nIn a study comparing Chinese and Vietnamese attitudes towards women, more Vietnamese than Chinese said that the male should dominate the family and a wife had to provide sex to her husband at his will.\n\n(From this male blogger’s point-of-view, I am not suggesting that a wife must provide sex to her husband at his will, but it is the hope that she wants to have sex with her partner with the same desired frequency.)\n\nViolence against women was supported by more Vietnamese than Chinese.\n\nDomestic violence was more accepted by Vietnamese women than Chinese women.\n\nSome Vietnamese women from Lào Cai who married Chinese men stated that among their reasons for doing so was that Vietnamese men beat their wives, engaged in affairs with mistresses, and refused to help their wives with chores, while Chinese men actively helped their wives carry out chores and care for them.\n\nVietnamese women travelling to China as mail order brides for rural Chinese men to earn money for their families and a rise in the standard of living, matchmaking between Chinese men and Vietnamese women has increased and has not been effected by troubled relations between Vietnam and China.\n\nVietnamese mail order brides have also gone to Taiwan and South Korea for marriage.\n\nThe main human rights issue in Southeast Asia is human trafficking.\n\nAccording to one study, Southeast Asia is a large source of human trafficking, with many individuals who fall victim to human trafficking being sent to Australia.\n\nVietnam, as well as other countries such as Cambodia, Laos, and the Philippines, are major source countries for human trafficking.\n\nWhile many of the victims that are a part of human trafficking are forced/kidnapped/enslaved, others were lured in under the assumption that they were getting a better job.\n\nAccording to a policy brief on human trafficking in Southeast Asia, although victims include girls, women, boys, and men, the majority are women.\n\nWomen tend to be more highly targeted by traffickers due to the fact that they are seeking opportunity in an area of the world where limited economic opportunities are available for them.\n\nUnskilled and poorly educated women are commonly led into human trafficking.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) report, women are trafficked the most.\n\nThe main causes of human trafficking in Southeast Asia are universal factors such as poverty and globalization.\n\nIndustrialization is arguably also another factor of human trafficking.\n\nMany scholars argue that industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore, created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries.\n\nThese migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders.\n\nA high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive.\n\nThe sex industry emerged in Southeast Asia in the mid 20th century as a way for women to generate more income for struggling migrants and locals trying to support families or themselves.\n\nSex industries first catered to military personnel on leave from bases, but as military installations began to recede the industry turned its attention to growing tourism.\n\nEven as the industry is looked down upon today there is still a large underground market that is demanding from traffickers.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, 6,000 women, as well as younger girls, were found to be in the human trafficking statistic.\n\nThe majority of the women and girls are trafficked to China, 30% are trafficked to Cambodia, and the remaining 10% are trafficked to the destinations across the world.\n\nSeveral cases have occurred where Vietnamese women were abducted or deceived to be sold to Chinese men.\n\nTotalling several thousands, in a significant number of cases the victims were underage.\n\nOverall literacy rates across Vietnam are high, with access to education being relatively equal between males and females.\n\nHowever, regional differences are still apparent, especially amongst the mountainous northern regions.\n\nFor example, in one study, the region of Lai Chau was found to have a literacy rate for men double that of the women’s literacy rate in the region.\n\nThere is a gender gap in education, with males being more likely to attend school and sustain their education than females.\n\nWomen and men tend to be segregated into different jobs, with more women serving in educational, communications, and public services than men.\n\nIn contemporary Vietnam, there has been significant economic advancement for women, especially for middle-class Vietnamese women.\n\nMiddle-class women have increasingly become more involved in the workforce sector outside of the house, with 83% of “working-age women” being involved in the labour force.\n\nThese women have been taking on professions dealing with a variety of fields such as sales, marketing, and advertising.\n\nFurthermore, women in the contemporary workforce and economy experience much higher wages than the generations before them.\n\nHowever, research has shown that many inequalities for women still exist, with women still receiving uneven employment benefits compared to their male counterparts.\n\nAccording to one study, 76% of women in the labor force are concentrated in the agricultural sector.\n\nAnd although under 10% of women in the labour force work in the textile industry, 80% of labourers in the textile industry are women.\n\nLocal credit associations do not feel secure giving loans to single mothers, which has resulted in a poverty increase for households that are led by a woman.\n\nThe average wage in the country of Vietnam was US$1,540 in 2012.\n\nIn 2011, studies showed “that women earn 13% less than men“.\n\nThe 2012 survey on workers’ salaries carried out by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) in enterprises nationwide revealed that female workers’ salaries are only 70-80% of their male colleagues’.\n\nThe global average gender pay gap is hovering around 17%.\n\nAccording to Nguyen Kim Lan, ILO national project coordinator, the only two occupational fields where pay is equal is in logistics, and household care.\n\nOne reason for the disparity is that companies view women as wanting to stay at home and perform more gender role duties.\n\nMore than 70% of labourers in Vietnam are women.\n\nThe International Labour Organization recently stated that the gender pay gap has started to increase, according to the ILO Global Wage Report during the 2012 – 2013 period, compared to 1999 – 2007.\n\nA 2% increase in the gap was recorded in Vietnam in the period.\n\nIn recent decades, Vietnam has stressed the importance of gender equality.\n\nTo address this goal, the Vietnam Women’s Union, an organization founded in 1930 under the Vietnam Communist Party, has pursued the advancement of women in many arenas.\n\nHowever, they also stress many aspects of Confucian doctrine that keeps a male-dominated hierarchy in place.\n\nAs of 2000, their membership has expanded to 11 million, which compromises for 60% of the female population in Vietnam over the age of 18.\n\nBecause of their large membership, the Vietnam Women’s Union has frequently been regarded as the representative for women in politics.\n\nTherefore, the VWU frequently advises during the policy-making of gender-related or women’s issues.\n\nHowever, their role has been disputed due to its shortcomings in promoting women’s right effectively.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Vietnam Women’s Union increased paid maternity leave and received a promise that they would be asked before the government implemented any policies that could potentially affect the welfare of women.\n\nHowever, the increased maternity leave was restored to its original length a few years later.\n\nWhile there are limits in the Vietnam Women’s Union that prohibit gender change in certain areas, there does not seem to be other organized civil society groups that are fighting for women’s rights.\n\nTwo areas that have seen little change throughout recent decades are the roles women play in the family, specifically motherhood, and the human rights problems women traditionally face in the region.\n\nIn 2001, the Vietnam Women’s Union was appointed to head the planning of a new legislation, a Law on Gender Equality, which set out to equalize conditions between both genders.\n\nThe legislation included several stipulations, including laws pertaining to retirement age for both men and women.\n\nThe law went into effect mid 2007.\n\nTheir focus on Confucian values which uphold a male-dominated hierarchy has received criticism.\n\nIn numerous studies, the VWU has been criticized for its lack of action against gender norms while placing too much emphasis on family structure.\n\nFurthermore, while their efforts have worked towards improving women’s status, the VWU faces criticism for their lack of advocacy towards women’s power.\n\nInvariably, Heidi thinks of her life as a woman in Switzerland by comparison.\n\nTradition dictates that the place of Swiss women is in the home in charge of housework and child care.\n\nBeing in a society with strong patriarchal roots, Swiss tradition also places women under the authority of their fathers and their husbands.\n\nSuch adherence to patriarchal domination changed and improved when the women of Switzerland gained their right to vote at the federal level on 7 February 1971.\n\nHowever, despite of gaining status of having equal rights with men, some Swiss women still have to be able to attain education beyond the post-secondary level, thus they earn less money than men, and they occupy lower-level job positions.\n\nAccording to swissinfo.ch in 2011, Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) were encouraging business companies to “appoint more women to top-level positions“.\n\nThose who are already working in business companies, according to same report, mentions that “women earn on average 20% less than men” in Switzerland, and the ratio was 6 out of 10 women were working part-time.\n\nProminent Swiss women in the fields of business and law include Emilie Kempin-Spyri (1853 – 1901), the first woman to graduate with a law degree and to be accepted as an academic lecturer in the country, and Isabelle Welton, the head of IBM Switzerland and one of few women in the country to hold a top-level position in a business firm.\n\nAbove: Logo of International Business Machines (IBM)\n\nFamily life has been traditionally patriarchal, following the model of a male breadwinner and a female housewife.\n\nIn Europe, Switzerland was one of the last countries to establish gender equality in marriage:\n\nMarried women’s rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, came into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favour with 54.7% of voters approving).\n\nAdultery was decriminalized in 1989.\n\nIn 1992, the law was changed to end discrimination against married women with regard to national citizenship.\n\nMarital rape was criminalized in 1992.\n\nIn 2004 it became a state offense in Switzerland.\n\nDivorce laws were also reformed in 2000 and 2005.\n\nIn 2013, further reforms to the Civil Code followed, removing the remaining discriminatory provisions regarding the spouses’ choice of family name and cantonal citizenship law.\n\nUntil the late 20th century, most cantons had regulations banning unmarried cohabitation of couples.\n\nThe last canton to end such prohibition was Valais in 1995.\n\nAs of 2015, 22.5% of births were to unmarried women.\n\nWomen face significant struggles with regards to work for pay.\n\nAlthough most women are employed, many are so on a part-time basis or in marginal employment.\n\nThe view that women, especially married women, should not work full-time remains prevalent.\n\nAmong the OECD, only the Netherlands has more women working part-time.\n\nAlthough the law no longer requires the husband’s consent for a wife’s work, in job interviews women are often asked for it.\n\nTaxation penalizing dual-income families exists in some cantons.\n\nThe OECD has stated that:\n\n“The lack of family-friendly policy and workplace support makes it very difficult for many Swiss parents, usually mothers, to combine work and family life.”\n\nThe OECD has also urged Switzerland to end the practice of irregular and interrupted school hours which makes it difficult for mothers to work, and to revise its tax and supplementary benefits policies.\n\nDespite all these, women have a legal right to work and to not be discriminated in the workforce, under the 1996 equality law.\n\nIn 2005, paid maternity leave was introduced in Switzerland, after voters approved it in a referendum.\n\nFour previous attempts to secure it had previously failed at the ballot box.\n\nAs in other Western countries, the 1990s and the 21st century saw reforms with regard to laws on domestic violence.\n\nMarital rape was made illegal in 1992, and since 2004 marital rape is prosecutable ex-officio (meaning it can be prosecuted even if the victim does not file an official complaint).\n\nSwitzerland also ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 2012, and the Istanbul Convention in 2017.\n\nEskisehir, Turkey, Tuesday 10 May 2022\n\nThe Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, is a human rights treaty of the Council of Europe against violence against women and domestic violence which was opened for signature on 11 May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nThe Convention aims at prevention of violence, victim protection and to end the impunity of perpetrators.\n\nAs of March 2019, it has been signed by 45 countries and the European Union.\n\nThe Convention came into force on 1 August 2014.\n\nIn a press release in November 2018, the Council of Europe stated:\n\n“Despite its clearly stated aims, several religious and ultra conservative groups have been spreading false narratives about the Istanbul Convention.”\n\nThe release stated that the Convention does not seek to impose a certain lifestyle or interfere with personal organization of private life.\n\nInstead, it seeks only to prevent violence against women and domestic violence.\n\nThe release states that:\n\n“The Convention is certainly not about ending sexual differences between women and men.\n\nNowhere does the Convention ever imply that women and men are or should be ‘the same’ and that the Convention does not seek to regulate family life and/or family structures:\n\nIt neither contains a definition of ‘family’ nor does it promote a particular type of family setting.”\n\nAccording to Balkan Insight, criticism of the Convention, strongest in Central and Eastern Europe and mainly by the far right and national conservatives, has little foundation in its actual content.\n\n“Using disinformation, populist rhetoric, and appeals to Christian and Islamic morality, critics have managed to reframe what is essentially a set of guidelines that creates ‘a comprehensive legal framework and approach to combat violence against women’, into a sinister attempt by Western Europeans to foist their overly-liberal policies on reluctant societies further east.“\n\nIn 2021, Turkey became the first and only country to withdraw from the Convention, after denouncing it on 20 March 2021.\n\nThe Convention ceased to be effective in Turkey on 1 July 2021, following its denunciation.\n\nOn 20 March 2021, Turkish President Erdoğan announced his country’s withdrawal from the Convention by a presidential decree published in the official government gazette.\n\n(From The Guardian, 24 November 2014:\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been accused of blatant sexism after declaring that women are not equal to men and claiming feminists in Turkey reject the idea of motherhood.\n\nThe devoutly Muslim president said biological differences meant women and men could not serve the same functions, adding that manual work was unsuitable for the “delicate nature” of women.\n\nHis comments ignited a firestorm of controversy on Twitter and one well-known female TV news anchor even took the unusual step of condemning the remarks during a bulletin.\n\n“Our religion Islam has defined a position for women: motherhood,” Erdoğan said at a summit in Istanbul on justice for women, speaking to an audience including his own daughter Sumeyye.\n\n“Some people can understand this, while others can’t.\n\nYou cannot explain this to feminists because they don’t accept the concept of motherhood.”\n\nHe recalled:\n\n“I would kiss my mother’s feet because they smelled of Paradise.\n\nShe would glance coyly and cry sometimes.“\n\n“Motherhood is something else,” he said, claiming that it should be a woman’s priority because Islam exalts women as mothers.\n\nHe went on to say that women and men could not be treated equally “because it goes against the laws of nature”.\n\n“Their characters, habits and physiques are different.\n\nYou cannot place a mother breastfeeding her baby on an equal footing with men.\n\nYou cannot make women work in the same jobs as men do, as in Communist regimes.\n\nYou cannot give them a shovel and tell them to do their work.\n\nThis is against their delicate nature.”\n\nErdoğan was apparently referring to the practice during and after the Second World War for women in Communist states such as the USSR to do heavy manual work in factories or in roles such as tram drivers.\n\nHe complained that in previous decades in Turkey women in Anatolian villages had done the back-breaking work while their menfolk idled away the time.\n\n“Wasn’t it the case in Anatolia?\n\nOur poor mothers suffered immensely and got hunchbacks while the men were playing cards and rolling dice at teahouses,” he said.\n\n“What women need is to be able to be equivalent, rather than equal.\n\nBecause equality turns the victim into an oppressor and vice versa.”\n\nErdoğan has been married since 1978 to his wife Emine, with whom he has two sons and two daughters.\n\nAylin Nazliaka, an MP from the main opposition Republican People’s party said Erdoğan “ostracised” women by portraying them as delicate, weak and powerless and limiting their role to motherhood.\n\n“Erdoğan has publicly committed a hate crime.\n\nBut I will continue to fight this man who sees no difference between terrorists and feminists,” she said in a written statement.\n\nSule Zeybek, an anchorwoman at the Turkish broadcaster Kanal D, hit back at Erdoğan’s comments live on television during a news bulletin.\n\n“I am a feminist and thank God I’m a mum.\n\nI wouldn’t kiss my mother’s feet but I have great respect for her,” she said.\n\nThe Islamic-rooted government of Erdoğan has long been accused by critics of seeking to erode the country’s secular principles and limiting the civil liberties of women.\n\nErdoğan has drawn the ire of feminist groups for declaring that every woman in Turkey should have three children and with proposals to limit abortion rights, the morning-after pill and caesarean sections.\n\nSeen by critics as increasingly authoritarian, he has repeatedly lashed out personally at female journalists who displeased him.\n\nBut the government’s attitude towards women came under even greater scrutiny after the Deputy Prime Minister, Bülent Arinç, caused a furore in August by suggesting women should not laugh loudly in public.\n\nActivists also say that government officials’ remarks about women and how they should be treated leave them exposed to violence.\n\nAccording to non-governmental organisations, more than 200 women in Turkey died as a result of domestic violence in the first six months of 2014.)\n\nThe notification for withdrawal has been reported to the Secretary-General by Turkey on 22 March 2021 and the Secretary-General has announced that denunciation will enter into force on 1 July 2021.\n\nThe withdrawal has been criticized both domestically and internationally, including by the opposition parties in the country, foreign leaders, the Council of Europe, NGOs and on social media.\n\nThe COE Secretary-General Marija Pejčinović Burić described the decision as “devastating news” and a “huge setback” that compromises the protection of women in Turkey and abroad.\n\nA CHP spokesperson claimed that the agreement cannot be withdrawn without parliamentary approval, since it was approved by Parliament on 24 November 2011.\n\nAccording to the CHP and various lawyers, the right to approve the withdrawal belongs to the Parliament according to Article 90 of the Constitution.\n\nHowever, the government claims that the President has the authority to withdraw from international agreements as stated in Article 3 of the Presidential Decree #9.\n\nThe decision sparked protests across Turkey and comes at a time where the domestic violence against women and femicides in the country are soaring.\n\nUS President Joe Biden described the move as “deeply disappointing“.\n\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged the authorities to reverse the decision.\n\nIn an official statement, the Turkish Presidency blamed the LGBT community for the withdrawal from the Convention, arguing that:\n\n“The Istanbul Convention, originally intended to promote women’s rights, was hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalize homosexuality – which is incompatible with Turkey’s social and family values.\n\nHence, the decision to withdraw.“\n\n(Homosexual activity is legal in Turkey.\n\nHowever, LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination, harassment and even violence from their relatives, neighbors, etc.\n\nThe Turkish authorities have carried out many discriminatory practices.\n\nDespite these, LGBT acceptance in Turkey is growing.\n\nIn a survey conducted by Kadir Has University in Istanbul in 2016, 33% of respondents said that LGBT people should have equal rights, which increased to 45% in 2020.\n\nAnother survey by Kadir Has University in 2018 found that the proportion of people who would not want a homosexual neighbour decreased from 55% in 2018 to 47% in 2019.\n\nA poll by Ipsos in 2015 found that 27% of the Turkish public was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and 19% supported civil unions instead.\n\nIstanbul Pride was held for the first time in 2003.\n\nTurkey became the first Muslim-majority country to hold a gay pride march.\n\nIt was also the first gay pride in the Middle East and the Balkans.\n\n(In 2002, Erdoğan said that:\n\n“Homosexuals must be legally protected within the framework of their rights and freedoms.\n\nFrom time to time, we do not find the treatment they get on some television screens humane.“\n\nHowever, in 2017 Erdoğan has said that empowering LGBT people in Turkey was “against the values of our nation“.\n\nIn 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey’s top Muslim scholar and President of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbaş, said in a Friday Ramadan announcement that the country condemns homosexuality because it “brings illness“, insinuating that same sex relations are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan backed Erbaş, saying that what Erbaş “said was totally right“.)\n\nThat view is shared by conservative groups and officials from Erdoğan’s Islamic-oriented ruling party, the AKP, who claim that the agreement is promoting homosexuality, encouraging divorce and undermining what constitutes a “sacred” family in their view.\n\nAnswering to criticism over the legality of withdrawal by the Presidency instead of Parliament, Erdoğan insisted that the withdrawal was “completely legal“.\n\nOn 29 June, Turkey’s top administrative court rejected a motion for stay of execution regarding Erdogan’s sole decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention on violence against women and ruled that it was legal for Erdoğan to withdraw the country out of the Convention since the authority to ratify and annul international agreements was among the president’s powers, according to Article 104 of the Constitution.)\n\nFrom Rebecca Solnit’s Wanderlust: A History of Walking:\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau remarked in his Confessions:\n\n“I can only meditate when I am walking. When I stop, I cease to think. My mind only works with my legs.“\n\nIn 1749 the writer and encyclopedist Denis Diderot was thrown into jail for writing an essay questioning the goodness of God.\n\nRousseau, a close friend of Diderot’s at the time, took to visiting him in jail, walking the six miles from his home in Paris to the dungeon of the Château de Vincennes.\n\nThough that summer was extremely hot, Rousseau walked because he was too poor to travel by other means.\n\n“In order to slacken my pace, I thought of taking a book with me.\n\nOne day I took the Mercure de France and, glancing through it as I walked, I came upon this question propounded by the Dijon Academy for the next year’s prize:\n\nHas the progress of the sciences and arts done more to corrupt morals or improve them?\n\nThe moment I read that I beheld another universe and became another man.“\n\nRousseau won the prize and the published essay became famous for its furious condemnation of such progress.\n\nIn his Discourse on Inequality, Rousseau portrays Man in his natural condition “wandering in the forests, without industry, without speech, without domicile, without war and without liaisons, with no need of his fellow men, likewise with no desire to harm them.”\n\nIn this ideology, walking functions as an emblem of the simple man and as, when the walk is solitary and rural, a means of being in nature and outside society.\n\nThe walker has the detachment of the traveller but travels unadorned and unaugmented, dependent on his or her own bodily strength rather than on conveniences that can be made and bought.\n\nWalking is, after all, an activity essentially unimproved since the dawn of time.\n\nRousseau walked extensively throughout his life.\n\nHis wandering life began when he returned to Geneva from a Sunday stroll in the country, only to find that he had come back too late:\n\nThe gates of the city were shut.\n\nImpulsively, the 15-year-old Rousseau decided to abandon his birthplace, his apprenticeship and eventually his religion.\n\nHe turned from the gates and walked out of Switzerland.\n\nIn Italy and France he found and left many jobs, patrons and friends during a life that seemed aimless….\n\nUntil the day he read the Mercure de France and found his vocation.\n\nEver after, he seemed to be trying to recover the carefree wandering of his youth.\n\nHe writes of one episode:\n\n“I do not remember ever having had in all my life a spell of time so completely free from care and anxiety as those seven or eight days spent on the road.\n\nThis memory has left me the strongest taste for everything associated with it, for mountains especially and for travelling on foot.\n\nI have never travelled so except in my prime and it has always been a delight to me.“\n\nHe continued to walk at every opportunity.\n\nElsewhere he claimed:\n\n“Never did I think so much, exist so vividly and experience so much.\n\nNever have I been so much myself as in the journeys I have taken alone and on foot.\n\nThere is something about walking that stimulates and enlivens my thoughts.\n\nWhen I stay in one place I can hardly think at all.\n\nMy body has to be on the move to set my mind going.\n\nThe sight of the countryside, the succession of pleasant views, the open air, a sound appetite and the good health I gain by walking, the easy atmosphere of an inn, the absence of everything that makes me feel my dependence, of everything that recalls me to my situation – all these serve to free my spirit, to lend a greater boldness to my thinking, so that I can combine them, select them and make them mine as I will, without fear or restraint.“\n\nIt was, of course, an ideal walking that Rousseau described – chosen freely by a healthy person amid pleasant and safe circumstances.\n\nIt is this kind of walking that would be taken up by his countless heirs as an expression of well-being, harmony with nature, freedom and virtue.\n\nRousseau portrays walking as both an exercise of simplicity and a means of contemplation.\n\nDuring the time he wrote the Discourses, he would walk alone in the Bois de Boulogne after dinner, “thinking over subjects for works to be written and not returning till night“.\n\nA solitary walker is in the world, but apart from it, with the detachment of the traveller rather than the ties of the worker, the dweller, the member of a group.\n\nWalking seems to have become Rousseau’s chosen mode of being, because within a walk he is able to live in thought and reverie, to be self-sufficient, and thus to survive the world.\n\nWalking provides him with a literal position from which to speak.\n\nAs a literary structure, the recounted walk encourages digression and association.\n\nA century and a half later, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf would, in trying to describe the workings of the mind, develop the style called stream of consciousness.\n\nIn their novels Ulysses and Mrs. Dalloway, the jumble of thoughts and recollections of their protagonists unfolds best during their walks.\n\nThis kind of unstructured, associative thinking is the kind most connected to walking.\n\nWalking is not an analytical act but an improvisational one.\n\nSoren Kierkegaard is the other philosopher who has much to say about walking and thinking.\n\nHe chose Copenhagen as his place to walk and study his human subjects.\n\nThe streets of Copenhagen were his reception room.\n\nKierkegaard’s great daily pleasure seems to have been walking the streets of his city.\n\nIt was a way to be among people for a man who could not be with them, a way to bask in the faint human warmth of brief encounters, acquaintances’ greetings and overheard conversations.\n\nA lone walker is both present and detached from the world around, more than an audience but less than a participant.\n\nWalking assuages or legitimizes this alienation:\n\nOne is mildly disconnected because one is walking, not because one is incapable of connecting.\n\nWalking provided Kierkegaard, like Rousseau, with a wealth of casual contacts with his fellow humans and it facilitated contemplation.\n\nKierkegaard wrote:\n\n“In order to bear mental tension as mine, I need diversion, the diversion of chance contacts on the streets and alleys, because associations with a few exclusive individuals is actually no diversion.“\n\nHe proposes that the mind works best when surrounded by distraction, that it focuses in the act of withdrawing from surrounding bustle rather than in being isolated from it.\n\nHe revelled in the turbulent variety of city life.\n\n“This very moment there is an organ grinder down in the street playing and singing.\n\nIt is wonderful.\n\nIt is the accidental and insignificant things in life that are significant.“\n\nAlthough his extensive walks were perceived as signs of idleness, they were in fact the foundation of his prolific work.\n\nThe city strolls distracted him so that he could forget himself enough to think more productively, for his private thoughts are often convolutions of self-consciousness and despair.\n\nIn a journal passage from 1848, he described how on his way home, “overwhelmed with ideas ready to be written down and in a sense so weak that I could scarcely walk“, he would often encounter a poor man.\n\nIf he refused to speak with him, the ideas would flee.\n\n“And I would sink into the most dreadful spiritual tribulation at the idea that God could do to me what I had done to that man, but if I took the time to talk with the poor man things never went that way.”\n\nLike Rousseau, Kierkegaard is a hybrid, a philosophical writer rather than a philosopher proper.\n\nTheir work is often descriptive, evocative, personal and poetically ambiguous.\n\nIt has room for delight and personality and something as specific as the sound of an organ grinder in a street or rabbits on the island of Saint Pierre on the Lake of Bienne where Rousseau lived on the estate of Ermenonville.\n\nWalking is a way of grounding one’s thoughts in a personal and embodied experience of the world that lends itself to writing.\n\nEdmund Husserl described walking as the experience by which we understand our body in relationship to the world.\n\nThe body, he said, is our experience of what is always here.\n\nThe body in motion experiences the unity of all its parts as the continuous “here” that moves toward and through the various “theres“.\n\nIt is the body that moves but the world that changes, which is how one distinguishes the body from the world.\n\nTravel can be a way to experience this continuity of self amid the flux of the world and thus to begin to understand each and their relationship to each other.\n\nTravel is about being utterly mobile, but the postmodern body is shuttled around by airplanes and hurtling cars, not even moving around by any apparent means muscular, mechanical, economic or ecological.\n\nThe body has become nothing more than a parcel in transit, a chess piece dropped on a square.\n\nIt does not move.\n\nIt is moved.\n\nWalking returns the body to its original limits again, to something supple, sensitive and vulnerable.\n\nWalking itself extends into the world.\n\nThe path is an extension of walking, the places set aside for walking are monuments to that pursuit.\n\nWalking is a mode of making the world as well as being in it.\n\nI find myself from time to time in the midst of psychological conflict with a wife who cannot comprehend that my search for personal happiness cannot revolve around being with her constantly, that I must be fulfilled in all the roles a man must do, besides husband.\n\nA friend has confessed to me their struggle between the desires of the day and the longings for tomorrow.\n\nHeidi was in turmoil having just ended a relationship and finding herself wondering why she was travelling and what would happen if she stopped.\n\nFrom Dan Kieran’s The Idle Traveller – The Art of Slow Travel:\n\nSlow travel rarely goes according to plan.\n\nEverything you encounter in your life, whether you consider it to be real or imagined, ultimately resides in thoughts and concepts in your brain.\n\nThe “real” world is far larger and more complicated than the one we are aware of.\n\nWe are all planning for tomorrow at the expense of today, which stops us from living in the moment and having to accept the imperfect nature of things as they are.\n\nBy the time we get to tomorrow, our life experiences mean what we thought we wanted has changed.\n\nSlow travel and you are rewarded with serendipitous delights.\n\nWe can control our own image of perfection and escape the tyranny of the real world not living up to what we want it to be, but we achieve this not by trying to conquer the world we live in, but by redesigning the focus of our lives internally.\n\nThis is achieved by travelling through a landscape, being passionately in love, not falling for the ambition of “tomorrow” and accepting the lifetime pursuit of expressing your own sense of creativity.\n\nWhen to comes to travel, this falling out of control beyond the comprehension of your own imagination, this is the source of everything.\n\n“Man’s real home is not a house, but the Road.\n\nLife itself is a journey to be walked on foot.“\n\nBruce Chatwin\n\nSo, my advice to Heidi, my advice to my Eskişehir friend, my advice to myself, is clear.\n\nGo for a walk.\n\nSources: Wikipedia / Google / The Rough Guide to Vietnam / Dan Kieran, The Idle Traveller / Rebecca Solnit, Wanderlust / “Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Women not equal to men“, The Guardian, 24 November 2014)\n\nEskişehir, Turkey, Saturday 13 November 2021\n\nWe are more connected than ever.\n\nOr so we are told.\n\nWe can travel to other continents in just a few hours.\n\nAnd so I have.\n\nWe can speak to friends and family whenever we want.\n\nWhether we want to or not.\n\nAt any time of day.\n\nWhether it is convenient or not.\n\nWe see their faces, beaming out of our laptop screens and mobile phones.\n\nWe need never be alone again.\n\nBut is solitude a choice?\n\nFor we have never felt more lonely.\n\nOn the train or bus on our daily commutes we avoid eye contact with those around us.\n\nWe pass the time with eyes glued to screens, listening to everything, anything, but our own thoughts.\n\nWe ponder the lives of others, yet adrift in the human ocean, we feel permanently alone.\n\nThe paradox is that the closer we have moved to other people – crammed into sprawling cities and permanently connected via the Internet – the lonelier we have become.\n\nThe history of modernity is also the history of loneliness.\n\nWe could counteract this loneliness by making more meaningful connections, by playing active roles in our communities or by taking more seriously the links we already have.\n\nWe could also learn to be comfortable on our own – to be happy, even to thrive alone.\n\nThe cure for loneliness is solitude, for instead of feeling deprived of the company of others, we should feel satisfied within ourselves, with the boundless world each of us contains and inhabits.\n\nAfter all is said and done one can feel utterly alone in a crowd of people, but completely content, solo, at the top of a mountain.\n\nWhat does it mean to be alone?\n\nWhy would anyone wish to pursue solitude?\n\nCan solitude find a balance with sociability?\n\nDo we need solitude or is it a thing best avoided?\n\nMy colleagues do not comprehend me.\n\nWhy do not wish to join them in taverns and restaurants and caf’és more regularly than I do?\n\nOn my days off, unfettered by wife or girlfriend demanding my attention, why do I not seek out the company of my companions of common circumstance?\n\nThey cannot understand it is not any dislike for them that I possess, but rather a love of solitude that I seek.\n\nWhether that solitude finds me walking along the river which though it bisects the city of Eskişehir they are resolutely uninterested as to whence it began or whither it ends, or whether I quietly explore alone a city quarter heretofore I had not yet visited, my colleagues view me askance as someone they can’t quite categorize, can’t quite accept nor reject.\n\nAnd this suits me fine.\n\nI do not feel the need to explain to them that which is difficult to define for myself beyond the stirrings that lie within me.\n\nAbove: Eskişehir, Turkey\n\nI walk because it is healthy for body, mind and soul.\n\nI travel because I wish to see what I have not yet seen, in the hopes that seeing will grant me more understanding of the society in which I reside.\n\nThe complex compulsions that propel me to do these simple acts are for those trained in the science of psychology to decipher.\n\nI am uninterested in such an analysis.\n\nRepulsed by the corruption of the world, tired of its limitless greed, certain devout men and women elected a life of solitude.\n\nSome chose to be hermits, separating themselves entirely from the society around them.\n\nSome formed small self-sufficient communities where they could be alone.\n\nTogether.\n\nIn solitude they pursued rigorous programmes of prayer and introspection.\n\nTheir writings influenced centuries of thought on what it meant to be human.\n\nAh, to pay attention to individuals – to their unique qualities and capacities, to their inner lives as separate from religious considerations!\n\nAh, to understand what can be discovered about yourself and the world in solitude, with only a library, curiosity and, perhaps, a cat!\n\nAh, what we could discover and prove for ourselves, to truly doubt what we had been taught to believe, to be free of recycled wisdom, to discover the truth, if any, about our world!\n\nAh, to focus instead on our emotions, charting and describing their shifting states, contrasting their various sentiments and sensibilities!\n\nAh, to seek solitude in the beauty and splendour of the natural world as an aid to poetic introspection, to explore our inner lives by reading from the book of nature or by reflecting on the latest novel!\n\nAh, to pursue solitude in places which have, miraculously, remained untouched by industrial progress, uncorrupted by society or by the mechanization of the world!\n\nIt is said that solitude is the school of genius.\n\nPerhaps that is why there are so few geniuses, so few writers, too few artists, for solitude is necessary to create art.\n\nPerhaps solitude can teach us how to think in freedom, how to enjoy a profound inner life.\n\nFreedom is considered to be one of the benefits of solitude.\n\nThe constraints of others will not have any effect on a person who is spending time in solitude, therefore giving the person more latitude in their actions.\n\nWith increased freedom, a person’s choices are less likely to be affected by exchanges with others.\n\nA person’s creativity can be sparked when given freedom.\n\nSolitude can increase freedom and moreover, freedom from distractions has the potential to spark creativity.\n\nIn 1994, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi found that adolescents who cannot bear to be alone often stop enhancing creative talents.\n\nAnother proven benefit to time given in solitude is the development of the self.\n\nWhen a person spends time in solitude from others, they may experience changes to their self-concept.\n\nThis can also help a person to form or discover their identity without any outside distractions.\n\nSolitude also provides time for contemplation, growth in personal spirituality, and self-examination.\n\nIn these situations, loneliness can be avoided as long as the person in solitude knows that they have meaningful relations with others.\n\nAbove: “One is the Loneliest Number“, Harry Nilsson\n\nWe surround ourselves with noise, chaos, the bright and shiny, to help us cope with the grim reality that we, in truth, live as we dream.\n\nAlone.\n\nSolitude is a state of seclusion or isolation, i.e., lack of contact with people.\n\nIt can have both positive and negative effects, depending on the situation.\n\nShort-term solitude is often valued as a time when one may work, think or rest without being disturbed.\n\nIt may be desired for the sake of privacy.\n\nUndesirable long-term solitude may stem from soured relationships, loss of loved ones, deliberate choice, infectious disease, mental disorders, neurological disorders, or circumstances of employment or situation.\n\nA distinction has been made between solitude and loneliness.\n\nIn this sense, these two words refer, respectively, to the joy and the pain of being alone.\n\nSolitude does not necessarily entail feelings of loneliness, and may in fact be one’s sole source of genuine pleasure for those who choose it with deliberate intent.\n\nSome individuals seek solitude for discovering a more meaningful and vital existence.\n\nFor example, in religious contexts, some saints preferred silence and found immense pleasure in their perceived uniformity with God.\n\nSolitude is a state that can be positively modified utilizing it for prayer allowing to…..\n\n“Be alone with ourselves and with God, to put ourselves in listening to His will, but also of what moves in our hearts, let purify our relationships.\n\nSolitude and silence thus become spaces inhabited by God, and ability to recover ourselves and grow in humanity.”\n\nThe Buddha attained enlightenment through uses of meditation, deprived of sensory input, bodily necessities, and external desires, including social interaction.\n\nThe context of solitude is attainment of pleasure from within, but this does not necessitate complete detachment from the external world.\n\nThis is well demonstrated in the writings of Edward Abbey with particular regard to Desert Solitaire where solitude focused only on isolation from other people allows for a more complete connection to the external world, as in the absence of human interaction the natural world itself takes on the role of the companion.\n\nDesert Solitaire was eventually recognized as an iconic work of nature writing and a staple of early environmentalist writing, bringing Abbey critical acclaim and popularity as a writer of environmental, political, and philosophical issues.\n\nBased on Abbey’s activities as a park ranger at Arches National Monument (now Arches National Park) in the late 1950s, the book is often compared to Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (see below) and Aldo Leopold’s A Sand County Almanac.\n\nA Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There is a 1949 non-fiction book by American ecologist, forester, and environmentalist Aldo Leopold.\n\nDescribing the land around the author’s home in Sauk County, Wisconsin, the collection of essays advocate Leopold’s idea of a “land ethic“, or a responsible relationship existing between people and the land they inhabit.\n\nThe book is considered a landmark in the American conservation movement.\n\nThe book has had over two million copies printed and has been translated into at least fourteen languages.\n\nIt has informed and changed the environmental movement and stimulated a widespread interest in ecology as a science.\n\nA Sand County Almanac is a combination of natural history, scene painting with words, and philosophy.\n\nIt is perhaps best known for the following quote, which defines his land ethic:\n\n“A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.\n\nIt is wrong when it tends otherwise.”\n\nThe book begins with a set of essays under the heading “Sand County Almanac“, which is divided into twelve segments, one for each month.\n\nThese essays mostly follow the changes in the ecology on Leopold’s farm near Baraboo, Wisconsin.\n\n(There is, in fact, no “Sand County” in Wisconsin.\n\nThe term “sand counties” refers to a section of the state marked by sandy soils).\n\nThere are anecdotes and observations about flora and fauna reactions to the seasons as well as mentions of conservation topics.\n\nThe second section of the book, “Sketches Here and There“, shifts the rhetorical focus from time to place.\n\nThe essays are thematically organized around farms and wilderness in Canada, Mexico and the US.\n\nSome of these essays are autobiographical.\n\n“Red Legs Kicking“, for example, recounts Leopold’s boyhood experience of hunting in Iowa.\n\nThe seminal essay “Thinking Like a Mountain” recalls another hunting experience later in life that was formative for Leopold’s later views.\n\nHere Leopold describes the death of a she-wolf killed by his party during a time when conservationists were operating under the assumption that elimination of top predators would make game plentiful.\n\nThe essay provides a non-technical characterization of the trophic cascade where the removal of single species carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem.\n\nThe book ends with a section of philosophical essays grouped together under the heading “The Upshot“.\n\nHere Leopold explores ironies of conservation: in order to promote wider appreciation of wild nature and engender necessary political support, one encourages recreational usage of wilderness that ultimately destroys it.\n\nMusings on “trophies” contrasts the way that some need a physical specimen to prove their conquest into the wilderness, though photographs may be less damaging than a trophy head to be mounted on the wall.\n\nHe suggests that the best trophy is the experience of wilderness itself, along with its character-building aspects.\n\nLeopold also rails against the way that policy makers need to find an economic motive for conservation.\n\nIn the concluding essay, “The Land Ethic“, Leopold delves into a more appropriate rationale for conservation.\n\nIn “The Ecological Conscience” section, he wrote:\n\n“Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.”\n\nLeopold felt it was generally agreed that more conservation education was needed.\n\nHowever quantity and content were up for debate.\n\nHe believed that land is not a commodity to be possessed.\n\nRather, humans must have mutual respect for Earth in order not to destroy it.\n\nHe philosophizes that humans will cease to be free if they have no wild spaces in which to roam.\n\nDesert Solitaire is written as a series of vignettes about Abbey’s experiences in the Colorado Plateau region of the desert southwestern United States, ranging from vivid descriptions of the fauna, flora, geology, and human inhabitants of the area, to firsthand accounts of wilderness exploration and river running, to a polemic against development and excessive tourism in the national parks, to stories of the author’s work with a search and rescue team to pull a human corpse out of the desert.\n\nThe book is interspersed with observations and discussions about the various tensions – physical, social, and existential – between humans and the desert environment.\n\nMany of the chapters also engage in lengthy critiques of modern Western civilization, US politics and the decline of America’s natural environment.\n\nOne of the dominant themes in Desert Solitaire is Abbey’s disgust with mainstream culture and its effect on society.\n\nHis message is that civilization and nature each have their own culture, and it is necessary to survival that they remain separate:\n\n“The personification of the natural is exactly the tendency I wish to suppress in myself, to eliminate for good.\n\nI am here not only to escape for a while the clamor and filth and confusion of the cultural apparatus but also to confront, immediately and directly if it’s possible, the bare bones of existence, elemental and fundamental, the bedrock which sustains us.“\n\nAbbey’s impression is that we are trapped by the machinations of mainstream culture.\n\nThis is made apparent with quotes such as:\n\n“Yet history demonstrates that personal liberty is a rare and precious thing, that all societies tend toward the absolute until attack from without or collapse from within breaks up the social machine and makes freedom and innovation again possible.“\n\nHe also believes the daily routine is meaningless, that we have created a life that we do not even want to live in:\n\nMy God!\n\nI am thinking, what incredible shit we put up with most of our lives – the domestic routine (same old wife every night), the stupid and useless degrading jobs, the insufferable arrogance of elected officials, the crafty cheating and the slimy advertising of the business men, the tedious wars in which we kill our buddies instead of our real enemies back in the capital, the foul diseased and hideous cities and towns we live in, the constant petty tyranny of automatic washers and automobiles and TV machines and telephone!\n\nAbbey displays disdain for the way industrialization is impacting the American wilderness.\n\nHe scolds humanity for the environmental duress caused by man’s blatant disregard for nature:\n\n“If industrial man, continues to multiply his numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural, and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making.“\n\nMan prioritizes material items over nature, development and expansion for the sake of development:\n\nThere may be some among the readers of this book, like the earnest engineer, who believe without question that any and all forms of construction and development are intrinsic goods, in the national parks as well as anywhere else, who virtually identify quantity with quality and therefore assume that the greater the quantity of traffic, the higher the value received.\n\nThere are some who frankly and boldly advocate the eradication of the last remnants of wilderness and the complete subjugation of nature to the requirements of–not man–but industry.\n\nThis is a courageous view, admirable in its simplicity and power, and with the weight of all modern history behind it.\n\nIt is also quite insane.\n\nI cannot attempt to deal with it here.\n\nAnother example of this for Abbey is the tragedy of the commons:\n\nA civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild, the spare, the original, is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself.\n\nIf industrial man continues to multiply its numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making.\n\nHe will make himself an exile from the Earth.\n\nHe also criticizes what he sees as the dominant social paradigm, what he calls the expansionist view, and the belief that technology will solve all our problems:\n\n“Confusing life expectancy with lifespan, the gullible begin to believe that medical science has accomplished a miracle—lengthened human life!“\n\nAbbey takes this theme to an extreme at various points of the narrative, concluding that:\n\n“Wilderness preservations like a hundred other good causes will be forgotten under the overwhelming pressure, or a struggle for mere survival and sanity in a completely urbanized completely industrialized, ever more crowded environment, for my own part I would rather take my chances in a thermonuclear war than live in such a world.”\n\nAnother major theme is the sanctity of untamed wilderness.\n\nAbbey states his dislike of the human agenda and presence by providing evidence of beauty that is beautiful simply because of its lack of human connection:\n\n“I want to be able to look at and into a juniper tree, a piece of quartz, a vulture, a spider, and see it as it is in itself, devoid of all humanly ascribed qualities, anti-Kantian, even the categories of scientific description.\n\nTo meet God or Medusa face to face, even if it means risking everything human in myself.“\n\nThere is no hidden meaning in the wilderness for Abbey:\n\nHe finds it beautiful because it is untainted by human perspectives and values.\n\nHe also concludes that its inherent emptiness and meaninglessness serve as the ideal canvas for human philosophy absent the distractions of human contrivances and natural complexities.\n\nAs such, Abbey wonders why natural monuments like mountains and oceans are mythologized and extolled much more than are deserts.\n\nThat emptiness is one of the defining aspects of the desert wildness and for Abbey one of its greatest assets – and one which humans have disturbed and harmed by their own presence:\n\nI am almost prepared to believe that this sweet virginal primitive land would be grateful for my departure and the absence of the tourist, will breathe metaphorically a collective sigh of relief – like a whisper of wind – when we are all and finally gone and the place and its creations can return to their ancient procedures unobserved and undisturbed by the busy, anxious, brooding consciousness of man.\n\nMidway through the text, Abbey observes that nature is something lost since before the time of our forefathers, something that has become distant and mysterious which he believes we should all come to know better:\n\n“Suppose we say that wilderness provokes nostalgia, a justified not merely sentimental nostalgia for the lost America our forefathers knew.\n\nThe word suggests the past and the unknown, the womb of the earth from which we all emerged.“\n\nHe quite firmly believes that our agenda should change, that we need to reverse our path and reconnect with that something we have lost – indeed, that mankind and civilization needs wilderness for its own edification.\n\nAbbey is not unaware, however, of the behaviour of his human kin.\n\nInstead, he realizes that people have very different ideas about how to experience nature.\n\nSome like to live as much in accord with nature as possible, and others want to have both manmade comforts and a marvelous encounter with nature simultaneously:\n\n“Hard work.\n\nAnd risky.\n\nToo much for some, who have given up the struggle on the highways, in exchange for an entirely different kind of vacation- out in the open, on their own feet, following the quiet trail through forests and mountains, bedding down in the evening under the stars, when and where they feel like it, at a time where the Industrial Tourists are still hunting for a place to park their automobiles.“\n\nHis process simply suggests we do our best to be more on the side of being one with nature without the presence of objects which represent our “civilization“.\n\nAbbey also was concerned with the level of human connection to the tools of civilization.\n\nHe was in favor of returning to nature and gaining the freedom that was lost with the inventions that take us places in this day and age:\n\nA man could be a lover and defender of the wilderness without ever in his lifetime leaving the boundaries of asphalt, power lines, and right-angled surfaces.\n\nWe need wilderness whether or not we ever set foot in it.\n\nWe need a refuge even though we may never need to go there.\n\nI may never in my life go to Alaska, for example, but I am grateful that it is there.\n\nWe need the possibility of escape as surely as we need hope; without it the life of the cities would drive all men into crime or drugs or psychoanalysis.\n\nThe wilderness is equal to freedom for Abbey, it is what separates him from others and allows him to have his connection with the planet.\n\nBut he wants others to have the same freedom.\n\nHis only request is that they cut their strings first.\n\nWhen Abbey is lounging in his chair in 110-degree heat at Arches and observes that the mountains are snow-capped and crystal clear, it shows what nature provides:\n\nOne extreme is able to counter another.\n\nThat a median can be found, and that pleasure and comfort can be found between the rocks and hard places:\n\n“The knowledge that refuge is available, when and if needed, makes the silent inferno of the desert more easily bearable.\n\nMountains complement desert as desert complements city, as wilderness complements and complete civilization.“\n\nAbbey makes statements that connect humanity to nature as a whole.\n\nHe makes the acknowledgement that we came from the wilderness, we have lived by it, and we will return to it.\n\nThis is an expression of loyalty:\n\n“But the love of wilderness is more than a hunger for what is always beyond reach.\n\nIt is also an expression of loyalty to the Earth which bore us and sustains us, the only home we shall ever know, the only Paradise we ever need if only we had the eyes to see“.\n\nHe continues by saying that man is rightly obsessed with Mother Nature.\n\nIt is where we came from, and something we still recognize as our starting point:\n\nStanding there, gaping at this monstrous and inhuman spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space, I feel a ridiculous greed and possessiveness come over me.\n\nI want to know it all, possess it all, embrace the entire scene intimately, deeply, totally, as a man desires a beautiful woman.\n\nAn insane wish?\n\nPerhaps not – at least there’s nothing else, no one human, to dispute possession with me.\n\nFinally, Abbey suggests that man needs nature to sustain humanity:\n\n“No, wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit, and as vital to our lives as water and good bread.“\n\nIn this context, the individual seeking solitude does so not strictly for personal gain or introspection, though this is often an unavoidable outcome, but instead in an attempt to gain an understanding of the natural world as entirely removed from the human perspective as possible, a state of mind much more readily attained in the complete absence of outside human presence.\n\nIn psychology, introverted individuals may require spending time away from people to recharge.\n\nThose who are simply socially apathetic might find it a pleasurable environment in which to occupy oneself with solitary tasks.\n\nPerhaps it is only in dreams do we truly connect with ourselves.\n\nPerhaps it is only in solitude can we meaningfully connect with those around us, including the Earth itself.\n\nSolitude inward and outward, from self out towards the cosmos.\n\nThe cure for loneliness is, in the end, the art of solitude.\n\nFrom Notes from a Ten-Foot Square Hut, Kamo no Chomei:\n\nFor reasons that remain somewhat mysterious he decided to leave the pleasures of courtly life behind.\n\nHe took vows and became a hermit, living the rest of his life in solitude.\n\nFirst, at the foot of a mountain and then in the hills outside a city in a ten-foot-square hut, such was the life of Kamo no Chomei (1153 – 1216).\n\nOf the flowing river the flood ever changes, on the still pool the foam gathering, vanishing, stays not.\n\nSuch too is the lot of men, of the dwelling of men, in this world of ours…..\n\nOne year a house is burnt down, the next it is rebuilt.\n\nA lonely mansion falls into ruins and one day a mere cottage replaces it.\n\nThe fate of the occupants is like that of their abodes.\n\nDeath in the morning, birth in the evening.\n\nSuch is man’s life – a fleck of foam on the surface of a pool.\n\nMan is born and dies.\n\nWhence comes he?\n\nWhither goes he?\n\nFor whose sake do we endure?\n\nWhence do we draw pleasure?\n\nNow since first he had conscious knowledge of the world about him had some 40 springs and summers gone by.\n\nAnd of many strange events had he had experience.\n\nOn the 28th day of the 4th month of 1177, while a violent storm was raging, a fire broke out in the southeast quarter of the city and extended to the northeast quarter.\n\nIn the course of that one night the whole was reduced to ashes.\n\nFolks say the fire began in a cottage used as a temporary hospital situated in the lane.\n\nFavoured by the wind the conflagration spread fanwise.\n\nDistant houses were smothered in the smoke, the nearer spaces were enveloped in coils of flame.\n\nThe air was filled with clouds of dust, which reflected the blaze, so that the whole neighbourhood was steeped in a glow of fire amid which tongues of flame darted over the adjoining streets.\n\nAmid such horrors who could retain a steady mind?\n\nSome, choked by the smoke, fell to the ground.\n\nOthers in their bewilderment ran straight into the flames trying to save their property, and were burnt to death.\n\nGreat stores of wealth were utterly destroyed.\n\nIn truth, the loss was incalculable.\n\nSixteen mansions of high court officers were consumed along with innumerable smal"
