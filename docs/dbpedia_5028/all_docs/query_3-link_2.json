        "text": "A ny proposal for an entirely new trans-portation mode requires a thorough system analysis that must address, among others, the following questions: 1. Is there a demand for the new mode? 2. Is the proposed new mode feasible, and shown to be operationally ready for implementation? 3. What is the current state of existing modes serving this demand? 4. Does the proposed mode as a package of benefits and costs improve upon the cur-rent modes? The purpose of this article is to analyze a proposed new mode of guided high speed ground transportation (HSGT), Maglev, and evaluate its technical, economic, social and other aspects. The need for high speed ground transportation modes is discussed in the following section. To provide the relevant background and needed understanding of issues involved in introducing a new mode of High speed rail (HSR) systems have a proven record of efficient services in about a dozen coun-tries. Recently, Magnetic Levitation (Maglev) technology for high speed gr...\n\nTransportation has become an integral part of our lives. In the modern era there is a saying – “Life runs on wheels”; which is very much true. People want to travel farther and faster these days. This calls for a potent transportation system with high performance and high reliability. When we hear the words “transportation” and “reliability” a picture of Train appears in our mind. As the world knows, railways have been extensively used for quite some time now. Although railways have proved to be the most reliable mode of transportation, it takes a back seat when it comes to high speed travel. Therefore we need to design a rail system which can achieve high speeds to reduce the duration of travelling of commuters without affecting the reliability. This very requirement gave birth to “MAGLEV trains”. A typical MAGLEV train works on the principle of “magnetic levitation”. Unlike conventional trains which rely extensively on internal combustion engines, MAGLEV trains rely on electromagnets for propulsion. MAGLEV trains are one of the applications of “high voltage engineering”\n\n\"With their Shinkansen trains, the Japanese once inaugurated a renaissance of the railway. Now, the Swiss Federal Railways are the first railway to upgrade an entire rail network at one swoop” (Benedikt Weibel, NZZ, 19.10.2004). With these words, Benedikt Weibel, then the CEO of the Swiss Federal Railways, summed up a forty-year history of modern railway development: The beginning of the railway highspeed era in 1964 thanks to Shinkansen, and the opening of Rail 2000, the biggest railway enhancement project in Switzerland up to the 1990s. This paper is about a three-fold story: 1st about the international transfer of ideas, 2nd about the Swiss way of dealing with high speed, and 3rd about institutional change. In the sum, it is the story of the Swiss Federal Railways path to the “Railway of the Future”, as it was internationally planned and realized since the 1950s/1960s. This is the English version of a paper that was translated into Japanese by my dear colleague Ayumu Banzawa, Osaka University, who had it published in: TETSUDO SHIGAKU (“Japan Railway History Review”), No. 31, October 2013, p. 33-40.
