I have gathered you here to announce that this is the end of the line. Circulation of ß as a currency will cease and all accounts and assets will be terminated.\n\nDamdred: -_-*\n\nRace Bannon: How could we have been so blind, that we didn't recognize what this would do to the community, the corruption of our games. We take cheating for granted. There's nothing we can do about it to repair it now, but I REFUSE to celebrate it!\n\nDamdred: *sigh*\n\nRace Bannon: Among those present here are the creme de la creme of cheats, who have it down to a fine art .. the rest of you simply adapted to the situation. You wouldn't stop the racketeering if you could\n\nRace Bannon: It's time to grab you fuckers by the balls and rip out the root of evil. I didn't want to have to do this but you leave me no choice.\n\nDamdred: wait for it\n\nRace Bannon: I just wish we would've quarantined this Diquidia and its tainted influence away to isolated, designated threads. Clone a virgin Liquidia, seed it with The Act and let it evolve to fruition with bragons and ®league and rantQT BUT WITHOUT GAMBLING on game outcome and player alignment during N1, persistent §killsets from having played games as scum PR and § to ß laundering\n\nDamdred: wait for iiit..\n\nRace Bannon: what on earth were we thinking Damdred?! 48h cycles and instant majority.. as if to get on with it already\n\nDamdred: hey if you know the outcome why stretch it, amirite? Look, no offense but the paradigm has shifted. This is bigger than it has ever been, more complex and intricate interactions is what you wanted. So what if there's the occasional match-fixing to feed the open market. It's realism in ways we couldn't have dreamt of, forget about it! You of all people rb should know better than to go holier-than-thou on us, Mr. Race Attorney. Those role blocker §kills came in handy, you have more ß than the rest of us combined\n\nRace Bannon: But we let it run wild, now we ave to face the consequences and bury this beast and start anew before it's too late, before all credibility in the fairness of TL mafia is lost. I won't blow the whistle and go public with this yet, but if I hear of any more bs going on I'm pulling the plug on this cesspool.\n\nP-EDIT you and your speakeasy contact network of degenerates are the only ones feeding on it. I never should have passed the torch to you let alone stand idly by as you permanently kept the position of trustee for yourself.\n\nHe types \"#backtothegoodolddays Good night gentlemen!\", clicks send and a message appears stating he may only PM staff and never post here again.\n\nDamdred: aand, he's gone.\n\nUpon refreshing, the attendants of the meeting notice: a nuke icon preceding his name has taken the place of the battlecruiser.\n\nDamdred: Well I'm glad that went smoothly\n\nDamdred: Apparently our beloved ®eserve governor has been withholding information about his true identity and history on this site, or not, who cares. Fact is your pal damy entertains good relations with a moderator. Yes, fear me.\n\nDamdred: Now, what to do with this massive vacuum? I know, let's play some good old and fair mafia; a prerogative in scarce supply nowadays it's true.\n\nI've been rolecop so many times I know each and everyone of you and your noble and dirty little secrets enough to generate the perfectly fitting setup and role distribution\n\nDamdred: To make it a little more interesting and since this will pretty much lay bare your cards it's clear that the members of the losing faction will have to be disposed of, exiled from our community. I, as your host and trusted bookie, will fill the recent vacancy for the position of governor and take 20÷ of the ß π , while the winner folk can split up the rest among themselves.\n\nHere's to a new chapter!\n\nThe mood lightens and the celebration regains its vigor as if nothing had happened.\n\nRace Bannon, the Reserve Banker, was nuked on N0.\n\nwill happen.

What else is a brother to do around here anyway.\n\nI admit I've had difficulty figuring out what a Grandfather's §kill entails. All I knew is it has to do with coming up with odor to infuse posts with, and communicate olfactory intentions and repell reason, on multiple levels and layers of the ban thread in order to dodge having to explain themselves. It was neglectable until one of the 5 founding fathers of The Pact got the hang of it and turned against the others. While the original mob kept losing muscle due to breaking hosting conduct rules, Bean's farts kept the danger stalling, keeping discussion from reaching conclusions about his unruly deeds by creating pungent buffers, inhanced with baseless accusations and lies about supposed modchecks, followed up with random links of supposed trolling, which proved to be the contrary more often than not but who has time, and will to check.

Finding out if someone is a trader, and who he is trading with is a skill, that can be trained, same as hiding, deceiving and incriminating others. Which means traders can slip if vi, noobs usually do when pressured,\n\nand pros can get framed and extorted if they lack at least one buffer level of profilactic, defensive evidence of their own framing.\n\nTictock is the designated hydra for initiating gfswitcheroo / Substance D requests, one has to earn the privilege of access to first, by talking to \"made\" ex-scummates, and successfully lobbying for a forum mafia game setup merger[/ancho®§]\n\ntrade HQ.

Various mind tricks are used (tests), he gets isolated and chaperoned nto a fake government agency building (meeting is staged, all attendants are informed), to work on spying on himself and fed fictitious drama scenarios for demoralization nd separation from his sanity zone (Barris letting Luckman choke to death? all scripted and acted; weird shapeshifting artifacts? brought forth by the monitoring camera feeds being tampered with, loss of focus? drugged, made to believe is stupid, physical sabotage, driven to rehabilitation by Donna, who later discusses deal with New-Path representative), so then finally he brings the \"flower\" to the dealers.. (luckman / barris / donna / freck) because that's the only behavioral programming that hasn't been invalidated by the conditioning.. it has been rewarded instead, with brain damage.

My awesomeness-sense is tingling, telling me you should totally fuse your game with Rels'.\n\nHear me out: Star wars and ghosts.. they go together perfectly. Where does the force come from. Consider the Yoda arc from the final 3 episodes of Clone Wars, where he meets and gets tested by the 5 transcended faces.\n\nHere's what itches me to persuade you to host day 1 of your game and use Rels' game thread for vote counts, and then Rels uses yours during night 1 / his day 1 and so on, Archon Mode.. I'd pay money to play in that.\n\nOk ok. Take a deep breath and tell me you totally botched those tags OR subconsciously .. you knew it, just the way it is, would set in motion a sequence of events that would result in you and rels, hosting TL Mafia LXXV, as equals.. and make it the most notable game ever.\n\nNo? That's alright.. I'll finish my presentation in loyal servitude to awesomeness itself, if you're not a believer that's fine. So .. hypothetically speaking.. yeah why not let's go all the way and introduce the forum mafia world to bragons. Here's what's meant by it.\n\nFact: your game setup as it is, is [M][N], because it has 13 afai can tell. But here's the thing.. the same player list would play in Rels' game as well, independent of each other. Nights would last 48 because they're basically the day of the parallel dimension, or whatever representing the other game. Hence, the [T] AND lack of [M], because 2 × [M] makes it disappear and turns the two into an unprecedented, but orthodox, singular TL Mafia game.\n\nTo make it even more of a revolution, I suggest you take up lunatic's offer of at least 4 man a scumteam, who can't communicate .. or have to guess their teammates first, or idk, die if they get it wrong, by analysing the bragon count, which gets issued at night after 24 hours have passed, and the timetags show exact dates instead of x hours.. and then simply PM it to the members of the scumteam come daystart.\n\nAnd before you get upset by how hard it is to calculate bragons, smply have someone else do it, a designated banker. I'd happily do it but I'd rather play in this epic game. It's really not that hard, just seek help and outsource it.\n\n=========\n\nAh Rels, glad you could join us. Jk, actually I haven't sent this to beentherdonethat yet because he pissed on your rug and you're entitled to make this decision to cooperate with him first.\n\nThink about it.. the scumteam communicates with ghosts via OUIJA board or something, to find out who their combatants are (researching black mathemagic = bragons ). You know you like where this is going, please don't let what I may or may not have done in 72 bias and make you auto-discard this, you know you can make it work with your setup... I'm lobbying for them to be similar, but if you add stuff like testaments and vengeful kills etc. I'd still totally play.\n\nBro?

Effortlessly he leads the exodus out of the choking silence aboard the ship, with an uplifting anecdote which the dauntless anthropologist recited to a recording droid, in a moment of booze-induced sentimentality. It's the story of the social genius of an outer rim tribe of humanoids, initially a hotchpotch of refugees from an ancient war. They've built a flourishing culture, strong with the force, from the ground up:\n\nWhen someone does something hurtful and wrong, the K-PAXians from the binary star system Agape - Satori, take the person to the center of town, and the entire tribe comes and surrounds him. For two days they’ll tell the man every good thing he has ever done.\n\nAll work ceases, and every man, woman and child gathers in a large circle around the accused individual. Then each person begins to talk to him out loud, about all the good things, every incident. Every experience that can be recalled, with any detail and accuracy is recounted. All his positive attribute, good deeds, strengths and kindnesses are recited carefully and at lenght.\n\nNo one is permitted to fabricate, exaggerate or be facetious about his accomplishments or persona.\n\nThe tribal ceremony does not cease until everyone is drained of every positive comment he can muster about the person in question.\n\nAt the end the tribal circle is broken, a joyous celebration takes place and the person symbolically and literally is welcomed back into the tribe.\n\nThe tribe believes that every human being comes into the world as GOOD, each of us desiring safety, love, peace, happiness.\n\nBut sometimes in the pursuit of those things people make mistakes. The community sees misdeeds as a cry for help.\n\nThey band together for the sake of their fellow man to hold him up, to reconnect him with his true Nature, to remind him who he really is, until he fully remembers the truth from which he’d temporarily been disconnected: “I AM GOOD”\n\nHe proceeds in wrapping up the attempt to boost his crew's morale.\n\nThe empire's strenght is intimidation on the individual level, and meticulous, profilactic defence against the coming together of individuals, on a mob level. That is why they fear brave souls like Leonard, who actively seek out the binding elements which make us come together and overcome their tyranny. Now that we are together the relevance-force will point us towards the empire's weaknesses.\n\nSW:R1H Mafia §core: 5 - 0\n\nMushrooms Badgers\n\nKoshi: 13.89 53.05\n\n1.77 π l 0.10 Rels l 0.12 Tumblewood l 0.04 Rels l 45.88 Tumblewood l 0.08 Rels ll 12.12 π l 29.25 Palmar l 6.43 Tumblewood lll\n\nHolyflare: 19.85 47.39\n\n1.63 π l 19.27 disformation l 27.02 Tumblewood l 0.08 Rels ll 18.22 π l 25.82 Palmar l 3.05 scott l 0.92 Tumblewood lll\n\nscott: 4.71 47.28\n\n0.80 π l 26.70 Rels l 20.50 Tumblewood ll 0.08 π l 4.35 Vivax l 3.93 π l 39.40 Vivax lll\n\nTictock: 47.48 45.22\n\n2.75 π l 27.37 Rels l 17.85 Tumblewood l 0.03 Rels ll 44.73 π l 3.37 scott lll\n\ngeript: 36.9 33.82\n\n4.68 π l 19.16 disformation l 0.15 DanelerH ll 32.22 π l 13.38 Vivax l 1.83 scott l 0.34 Tumblewood lll\n\nPalmar: 42.85 18.69\n\n0.45 π l 13 Rels l 24.45 geript l 5.66 Tumblewood l 3.70 geript l 0.03 Rels ll 42.40 π l 5.60 Holyflare lll\n\nDanelerH: 24.63 0.68\n\n4.18 π l 14.68 Koshi l 28.88 geript l 0.25 scott ll 20.45 π l 0.68 Tumblewood lll\n\n? ?

For every misslynch scum get 1 eel each, same for nightkills. For every scum lynch they lose (#T-1)÷#S each; in a 13p game on d1 that would be -3§.\n\nHow to keep live game §core: for the former scenario, upon successfully nightkilling a townie the §core would be 2 to 0 (mafia always first), while for the latter, plus same nk, 1 to 3 would be true.\n\nHow to count badgers: Same as bragons but limited to the flip information at hand, and instead of adding everything up, they are displayed separately\n\n\"They\" implies of course badgers: timeframes players managed to vote for scum as opposed to town.\n\nFor example in a 13p game with 3 scum if you vote scum for 4 hours on day1 you get 9/3 x 4 = 12 (town - 1 to scum ratio x timeframe in hours; minutes get converted by × 1.666).\n\n..but also snakes: if you vote for a townie instead you get 1 snake per hour\n\n..and mushrooms: you accumulate 1 for every hour you spent not voting.\n\nWhat's more, you ask? The realization that punishment for bannable offences is far too lax.\n\nTherefore:\n\nwhen sitting out games, there should be links to the relevant posts, which lead to bans. It's preferable if they get satirized somehow, using smileys as hyperlink fronts for example.\n\nthe sitoutee should get busy and provide accurate §core, every day, badgers every other day, bragons and eels at conclusion.\n\nbanned folk should use their timeouts and their slots in this topic to get creative and concoct setups and flavor for ongoing, or if masochistic past games, and suggest connector nodes to intertwine them with upcoming games, and provide advertisment and background lore.\n\nhttp://socialnumber.com/discussion/what-do-internet-and-primordial-soup-have-common\n\nWHAT IF I TOLD YOU\n\nthat this never stopped being a [T] game\n\n+ Show Spoiler [Do you believe in fate] + Leo?\n\nLeo: No.\n\nKang ®§: Why not?\n\nLeo: Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.\n\nKang ®§: I know exactly what you mean.\n\nI've watched you, Leo.

Keep it comprehensive and the sub-games (elements) neatly separated using two line breakers. Keep votes on top, separated with 3 line breakers from the rest of your post.\n\n3] Do not screenshot-post or directly quote any of the PMs that I send you. Doing so will result in a mod-kill. Pretending to break this rule is the same as actually breaking it. You may paraphrase, but use caution. When in doubt, run it by me first.\n\n4] Do not use encrypted text, hidden text, small text, or any other hard-to-read text when posting..\n\n5] Upon having been lynched or killed, you are out of that sub-game only. Do not post there anymore until the game is over, however you may post whatever in the games where you're still alive, including \"Bah!\" posts + Show Spoiler [details] +\n\nUsually you do not talk about ongoing games. But since this is part of a 4 game bundle, you may freely discuss the other ongoing sub-games.\n\n6] Do not talk about this game with anybody else outside of the designated threads unless your role PM explicitly says that you can.\n\n7] Aspire to good sportsmanship. Please don't be a jerk to your fellow players. + Show Spoiler [My subjective take] +\n\non personal attacks is that on the internet, especially in games about lynching, shooting and stabbing where you have to put in considerable effort just to participate let alone deliver an astute performance, obnoxious and poorly argued discrediting of intellectual investment is way more detrimental to enjoyment than derogatory names, insults and flaming. Bearing anonymity in mind I wouldn't censor expression to shield impressionable people from taking vulgarity too personal. But I refrain from imposing my way of seeing it.\n\nHeated discussion is fine, but vehement personal attacks, insults and flaming are not. If I feel that your behavior is preventing other players from enjoying the game, I reserve the right to force-replace, mod-kill or simply issue you a warning.\n\n8]\n\nDay, Night, and Twilight:\n\n9] There are 4 games in total. With regard to the order in which they start the first 3 have Day phases lasting for 2 days apiece, while silent Nights kick in after deadline, and the last one will last for 24 hours + twilight from the others. Night phases will last for the duration of the other games' dayphases. I will post specific deadlines in the game thread at the start of every Day / Night phase.\n\n10] When someone gets hammered (a majority is reached) Twilight is in effect until the deadline of that dayphase (regardless of time of hammer the flips get announced then). Players may continue to talk during Twilight, including the player that has been lynched, but consider it part of the Wind game's dayphase after the first week.\n\n11] If you do not send me your Night action before the specified deadline, I will assume that you are not performing an action on that Night.\n\n12] If you know you will be unavailable during a Night phase, you may send me your night action during the preceding Day phase if you so desire.\n\n13] Deadline extension requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nVoting:\n\n14] There will be a voting thread. Votes should look like this: Vote: N, using the bold tag, preferably linked to an anchor for the relevant game thread post's location, and highlighted on the top of the post (preferably linked to the anchor as well). This is the only exception from the hidden text rule. Nicknames are fine, as long as I can understand them.\n\n15] If you don't want your vote to count for bragon calculation, PM me within 3 minutes of your vote with the subject \"void vote\". Unvotes are helpful but not necessary.\n\n16] Please refrain from engaging in any kind of voting trickery. If it looks like a vote, I'm counting it as a vote.\n\n17] A quicklynch will occur when a majority (more than 50% of all possible votes) is reached. The number of votes needed to hammer will be included with every vote count.\n\n18] If a majority is not reached by the deadline then the person with the earliest, most votes eats rope.\n\n19] Once a hammer occurs, no votes or unvotes will prevent the lynch from happening.\n\n20] You may VOTE: No Lynch to end the Day with no lynch (which will also require a majority). You may VOTE: Draw to end the game in a draw (which will require 100% agreement from all living players) if you wish to insult me.\n\nActivity:\n\n21] You will be expected to post at least thrice every 48 hours. If you go more than 48 hours without posting 3 times, you will be prodded. If you receive a prod, you will have 24 hours to post in the game thread. If you do not respond to your prod within 24 hours, you will be replaced. Additionally, if I have to prod you more than two times, you will be replaced.\n\n22] I will keep a record of voting bragging rights for townies, aka bragons, which should be incentive enough for you to vote.\n\n23] If you know that you will have limited access to the game for more than a few days, please let me know via PM, not in the thread!\n\nCommunication with the Moderator:\n\n24] Ideally you should consider me perfect and the \"mistakes\" I make as my way of empathizing with stupidity. Nevertheless I will correct any errors you might notice regarding vote counts, deadlines, or anything else related to the game.\n\n25] Once the game commences I will not answer any role-related questions in the game thread, and I don't respond well to criticism there either. Nevertheless should you need to get my attention, include @Mod in your post. Also, bolding will help catch my eye, but I repeat: if you have any questions about your role, the (theoretical implications of the) roles of any other players in the game, or (theoretical) role interactions, send me a PM. Do not try to trick me into confirming a player's role. I will not be amused.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n26] If you have any problems with another player, send me a PM and I will do my best to resolve the issue. If you like me take my personal views in the spoiler of the seventh rule to heart.\n\n27] If a player is mod-killed during the Day phase, either the game freezes until a replacement is found or the day ends immediately and the game transitions into twilight.\n\n28] Don't post like this!\n\n29] The flavor text is for entertainment purposes only. Analyze it at your own risk.\n\n30] Do not ask me to mod-kill, force-replace, or discipline any other player in the game. That is my decision to make, not yours.\n\n31] As the moderator, my word is final. Please respect my instructions and my decisions.\n\n32] I reserve the right to change these rules during the game if necessary. If this happens, I will inform everybody of the rule change in the thread.\n\n33] In addition to these rules, some site-wide rules also apply.\n\n34] If you catch a glimpse of someone breaking the rules, be sure to accumulate evidence before you make accusations.\n\n35] Probably will prove to be the most problematic rule of all, but for me it's common sense: while the games are afoot, and you are eligible to post, you may not influence others' perception of you by invoking anything from your personal life outside the overarching game context, like plans, excuses or even reasons for mood shifts. Off-topic talk is not only ok, I encourage it. + Show Spoiler [details] +\n\nInteresting facts, opinions, humor, performance in other fields etc., bring it, so don't get me wrong, I want you to manifest your personality as much as you like, and talk about really anything except the thing I just mentioned. Some things that compromise your anonymity you should think twice about posting, is all. It's not even about your anonymity, don't get me right but then wrong again, it's about the reading experience. There are 7 billion+ people with real life stuff going on, and mafia can fabricate lies about it, therefore I want none of it in bannon games, ever. There are other threads for you to be all you are; in bannon game threads you basically died, and your death/physical-plane-transcendence/ascension induced this very selective type of amnesia.. pretty much for the same reason actors don't start yapping about their issues, or at least it doesn't wind up in the final take, which makes for a better viewing / reading / hosting experience.\n\nSetup:\n\n36] Flavor for roles will be revealed upon death, anywhen post-death, post-game or not at all; never via role PM.
