Ravel scholar Aroie Orenstein introduces the book with an overview of Ravel’s career, personality, aesthetics, and oeuvre. The book is then divided into four sections. The first provides introductory documents including an autobiographical sketch, a statement on aesthetics, and Ravel’s formal lecture, ‘““Contemporary Music,” delivered in Houston, Texas in 1928. The next section contains Ravel’s correspondence —a selection of some 350 letters, most of which are published here for the first time in English. Also included are letters sent to Ravel by Cocteau, Colette, Fauré, de Falla, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, and others. Section Three is a compilation of articles by Ravel, who was a brilliant critic. Ravel discusses many compositions, with particular attention given to the works of his colleagues, among them Debussy, Fauré, de Falla, and Stravinsky. The final section is made up of Ravel’s press interviews, originally published between 1911 and 1933, in which his musical views are further clarified. All of the above documents are fully annotated. In addition to sixteen plates, there are nine appendixes which contain a diversity of valuable information, from Ravel’s analyses of his own music to Jean Touzelet’s “Historical Interpretations, 1911-1988,” a unique discography which traces recordings made by Ravel (Continued on back flap)\n\n“RAVEL READER Correspondence : Articles : Interviews\n\nGOMPIISE\n\nDEAND.

Manuscript of Ravel’s analysis of a passage from the Valses nobles et sentimentales\n\nPreface\n\nhis book is a natural outgrowth of my first study, Ravel: Man and Musician, published by Columbia University Press in 1975. In preparing that study, one point became increasingly clear: among the most perceptive comments about Ravel’s life and art were those made by the composer himself. The focus of this book, therefore, is on Ravel in his own words, both written and spoken. The most important writings to come from Ravel’s pen are of course his music manuscripts, which constitute his ultimate legacy. The documents in this book will shed much light on that legacy, and on a host of related matters. The composer’s written words have been divided into two parts, letters and articles, the latter including replies to several inquiries; the spoken words consist of press interviews. Three documents have been selected which offer a survey of Ravel’s career and musical thought: an autobiographical sketch drawn up by his colleague and biographer Roland-Manuel, a brief statement on aesthetics entitled “Some Reflections on Music,” and Ravel’s formal lecture, “Contemporary Music,” delivered in\n\nHouston, Texas, on April 7, 1928. Finally, a number of appendixes are included whose titles are self-explanatory; of particular importance are Ravel’s analyses of his own music, and Jean Touzelet’s “Historical Interpretations (19111988),” a fresh approach to discography which future authors may wish to imitate. The largest part of this book is devoted to Ravel’s correspondence. It appears that he wrote about 1500 letters in the course of his lifetime, and these documents, like those of other creative artists, form an inner diary of his career. One may observe Ravel’s personal interests and train of thought, his joys and sorrows, frustrations and quirks, his battles with critics, travels and concert tours, his period of military service during World War I, advice to young musicians, and a wealth of observations about the vibrant Parisian musical\n\nscene. His earliest known letter was written at the age of twenty-three, while a student at the Conservatoire, and the last one was signed in October 1937, some eight weeks before his death at the age of sixty-two. With the exception of one letter copied out in English, which he did not understand, all of his letters are in French, the only language in which he was fluent. He knew some Basque, ° and would occasionally use a Basque phrase, but no complete letter in this language has yet come to light. Ravel was proud of the French language and wrote with care and skill. His letters are almost always dated, often with a x1\n\nxii:\n\n: : Preface\n\nprinted return address, and, in the postwar years, his monogram. If the formal letters bespeak a personal blend of simplicity and sophistication, politeness, modesty, clarity, and polish, the colorful notes written to friends reveal a joie de vivre, tender warmth, playfulness, and ironic humor. There are also touching letters of condolence, and moments of despair, particularly during the upheaval of World War I. The vocabulary includes some esoteric terms, colloquialisms, slang, and on rare occasion, vulgarity. As one might expect, the largest number of letters were sent to close friends. There were about 250 letters to the Godebski family, and some 150 to Roland-Manuel and Maurice Delage. But there was practically no correspondence with colleagues such as pianist Ricardo Vifies and mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori. In an interview with this writer, Madame Bathori explained why this was so: “There was no need to write. We saw each other all the time.” Like many in his generation, Ravel held a writing instrument between the second and third fingers of his right hand, pulling it toward himself as he wrote, and the result in this case was an angular and sharply chiseled handwriting. Over the years, there were two noticeable changes in his penmanship: at age twenty he began to form the letter a as “ ” (rather than “ @”), and during the last few years of his life, owing to a debilitating disease, his handwriting became smaller and withered. A number of letters were typewritten in the postwar years, and in 1926 Ravel had a telephone installed in his home. Despite these ultramodern conveniences, old habits prevailed, and the volume of his hand-\n\nwritten letters continued unabated. The only book until now dealing with Ravel’s correspondence, Chalupt and Gerar’s Ravel au miroir des ses lettres (Paris, 1956), presented some 190 letters. Unfortunately, a study of the holographs indicates that many letters were printed with omissions, perhaps in order to “protect” Ravel or other individuals. This is certainly unnecessary today, more than half a century after the composer’s death. Of the 350 letters in this book, some 200 have remained unpublished until now, 80 have been partially printed in French, and 70 have previously appeared in French in their entirety. (Only a handful have ever appeared in an English translation.) These letters are addressed to some 100 correspondents, who can be identified in almost every case. Also included are some letters sent to Ravel, and several letters written about him. One may thus observe the composer as a son, brother, nephew, friend, and colleague. Letters are fragile documents, and some letters and even entire collections have already been lost or destroyed. Thus, a “complete” edition, although a desirable goal for the future, will in fact prove to be an impossibility. If the choice of letters is highly selective, all of Ravel’s articles that could be traced have been included. The total comes to nineteen articles (and three replies to inquiries), which appeared between 1909 and 1933. Ten articles are\n\nPigface\n\n+ 2 2 sit\n\nconcert reviews that Ravel wrote as a professional critic for La Revue musicale de la S.I.M. (three reviews from February to April, 1912), and Comedia illustré (seven reviews from January 1913 to June 1914). His critical observations reflect a strong desire for impartiality, clear aesthetic priorities, and keen artistic intuition. Moreover, when he reviews works by Falla, Fauré, or Stravinsky, among others, Ravel speaks not only as a critic, but as a close friend of the artist in question. A few remarks will undoubtedly raise some eyebrows:\n\nBeethoven’s Missa Solemnis is curtly dismissed as an “inferior” work, and there is some harsh criticism of Brahms’ Second Symphony. One need not agree with all of Ravel’s views in order to appreciate his brilliant insights, razor-sharp clarity, probity coupled with gentle irony, and some vivid descriptions of theatrical productions, which make the reader feel that he is also sitting in the audience. Other articles are scattered singly in various publications, and their topics range from Debussy’s /mages and Fauré’s songs to Nijinsky’s choreography and the importance of jazz. Ravel’s last article, published in November 1933, deals sympathetically with the plight of the young generation of composers. The choice of press interviews is once again selective: the thirty which have been chosen are presented in their entirety, and originally appeared between 1g1i and 1933 in American, Argentinian, Austrian, British, Danish, Dutch,\n\nFrench, Spanish, Swedish, and Swiss publications. Other important interviews, no doubt, have yet to be traced. (A detailed list of articles and interviews\n\nis found in the bibliography.) In a letter to Cipa Godebski (see letter no. 82), Ravel admitted that he once wrote back “nothing but fibs” in reply to an interviewer’s questions, and on another occasion he complained to a Dutch journalist about being misquoted. Despite these problems, the interviews are usually frank and revealing. They not only complement the letters and articles, but often deal with important issues that are not raised elsewhere. In 1975, the centenary celebrations of Ravel’s birth included many special concerts, recordings, and exhibitions on both sides of the Atlantic, and in 1985 the first issue of a new journal, Cahiers Maurice Ravel, provided further evidence that Ravel has entered the pantheon of twentieth-century composers. In a brief necrology, “Homage to Ravel, 1875-1937,” which appeared in Modern Music (January—February 1938), a young American composer, Elliott Carter, perceptively summarized the importance of Ravel’s art as follows:\n\nMaurice Ravel was an exponent of that careful, precise workmanship, elegance, and grace he so admired in the music of Mozart, of whom he\n\nwas not an unworthy descendant. The type seems to grow rarer as this troubled century progresses. His work, however, was a monument to the dignity and precision that even now all worthy musicians should strive for\n\nwr\n\nSk\n\nSP eae\n\nand that French music has at its best always captured. Combined with an extraordinary sense of style and infallible ear was a refinement of taste and a unique inspiration that made every work he wrote right and final in its own category. All his life he shunned cheapness and facility, yet his style and manner of orchestration have already left their mark on all music, from the simplest jazz to the most elaborate works of Stravinsky. His music will always be a great glory to the art he practiced so long and so well. We should idolize neither the man nor his extraordinary epoch, in which, French music, literature, and painting stood at the forefront of European cultural life. Rather, let us recall Kierkegaard’s dictum: “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” Ravel’s life and thought have already receded into history; we may perhaps best understand them as they unfold in the composer’s own words.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nt is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance of institutions and many individuals in preparing this book. Many others were previously acknowledged in Ravel: Man and Musician. Six months of full-time research in Paris were made possible by a grant from the Fondation Singer-Polignac, Dr. Etienne Wolff, president, to whom I express my deep gratitude. I am also pleased to acknowledge a City University of New York PSC-BHE Research Award. This book could not have been published without the kind cooperation of Madame Alexandre Taverne, the present inheritor of the estate of Maurice Ravel. The insights of the late RolandManuel and Manuel Rosenthal, two of Ravel’s distinguished disciples, will be found in these pages, along with those of some fifty other colleagues of the composer whom I have interviewed over the past two decades. To all of them I owe a special debt of gratitude. In addition, I wish to thank Jean-Michel Nectoux for his devoted reading of the manuscript and his many helpful suggestions; Jean Touzelet, for his excellent discography found in Appendix F, and for his many kindnesses over the years; Bruno Sébald, who catalogued Ravel’s personal record collection (Appendix G); Francois Lesure and the music staff of the Bibliothéque Nationale for their generous assistance; J. Rigbie Turner (the Pierpont Morgan Library) and Wayne Shirley (Music Division of the Library of Congress) for their prompt replies to my inquiries. In addition to the individuals who are cited in the text, I am also grateful to all of the private collectors and public institutions who kindly provided me with photocopies of Ravel’s autograph letters in their collections. Their names appear in appendixes H and I. I am indebted to the following individuals who translated parts of this book: the interviews in Dutch, Ludi P. Kerman; those in Danish and Swedish, Asa Hornfeldt; passages in Basque, Pierre Courteault. My English translation of the French texts was reviewed with Micheline Weisbroat, to whom I am\n\nparticularly grateful.

In 1928, the Aeolian company, a firm specializing in player pianos, inaugurated a series ofrecordings on specially perforated rolls, which would also contain autobiographical comments drawn up by the composer. Monsieur Henri Dubois, the artistic director of the company, asked Ravel to participate in the project. Rather than write his own commentary, the composer in turn asked Roland-Manuel to act as his secretary in an interview. Although M. Dubois rejected the interview format, it was agreed that Ravel would dictate an autobiographical statement which he would later retouch. For whatever reason, he never corrected his colleague’s notes and withdrew from the project. Thus, the following article is based on Roland-Manuel’s uncorrected draft.3 was born in Ciboure, a township in the Lower Pyrenees next to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, on March 7, 1875.* My father, originally from Versoix, on the shore of Lake Geneva, was a civil engineer. My mother belonged to an old Basque family. At the age of three months, I left Ciboure for Paris, where I have lived ever\n\nsince. Even as a child, I was sensitive to music—to every kind of music. My father, who was much better versed in this art than most amateurs, knew how to develop my taste and stimulate my zeal. Instead of solfeggio, the theory of which I never learned, I began to study the piano about the age of six. My teachers were Henri Ghys,° followed by M. Charles-René,° from whom I took my first lessons in harmony, counterpoint, and composition. In 1889 I was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire in the preparatory piano class of M. Anthidme,’ and two years later I was in the class of Charles de Bériot.®\n\nFirst Compositions My first compositions, which have remained unpublished, date from about 1893.2 I was then in M. Pessard’s!? harmony class. Emmanuel 29\n\n30\n\n: : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\nChabrier’s!! influence was apparent in the Sérénade grotesque for piano, and that of Satie!? in the Ballade de la Reine morte d’aimer. In 1895, I wrote my first published works: the Menuet antique and the “Habanera” for piano. I believe that the “Habanera” contains the germ of several elements which were to predominate in my later compositions.’\n\nIn 1897, while studying counterpoint and fugue with André Gédalge,'* I entered Gabriel Fauré’s!> composition class. I am pleased to acknowledge that I owe the most valuable elements of my technique to André Gédalge. As for Fauré, his advice as an artist gave me encouragement of no less value. My unfinished, unpublished opera Shéhérazade dates from this period; it was rather strongly influenced by Russian music. I competed for the Prix de Rome in 1901 (when I received third prize), in 1902, and in 1903.!° In 1905, the jury excluded me from the final round of the competition. Jeux d'eau, which appeared in 1901, marks the beginning of all the pianistic innovations which have been noted in my works. This piece, inspired by the sound of water and the musical sounds made by fountains, cascades, and streams, is based on two themes, like the first movement of a sonata, without\n\nhowever submitting to the classical tonal scheme.\n\nMy String Quartet in F (1902-03) reflects a preoccupation with musical structure, imperfectly realized, no doubt, but which appears much clearer than in my previous compositions. Shéhérazade, in which Debussy’s influence, at least spiritual, is rather evident, dates from 1903. Once again, I\n\nsuccumbed to the profound fascination which the Orient has exerted upon me since childhood. The Miroirs (1905) form a collection of piano pieces which mark a rather considerable change in my harmonic evolution; this disconcerted musicians who until then had been thoroughly accustomed to my style.!7 The earliest of these pieces—and, it seems to me, the most characteristic—is “Oiseaux tristes,” the second composition. In this work, I evoke birds lost in the torpor of\n\na very somber forest, during the hottest hours of summertime.\n\nAfter the Miroirs, |composed a Sonatine for piano and the Histoires naturelles. The direct, clear language and the profound, hidden poetry of Jules\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 31\n\nRenard’s works tempted me for a long time. The text itself demanded a particular kind of musical declamation from me, closely related to the inflections of the French language. The first performance of the Histoires naturelles at the Société Nationale de Musique in Paris provoked a genuine scandal, followed by lively polemics in the musical press of the time.!8 The Histoires naturelles prepared me to compose L’Heure espagnole, a comic opera with a libretto by M. Franc-Nohain,!? which is itself a sort of conversation in music. It affirms my intention of renewing the tradition of opera buffa. Ma Mere !’Oye, children’s pieces for piano, four hands, dates from 1908.?° My intention in these pieces was to evoke the poetry of childhood, and this naturally led me to simplify my style and restrain my writing. I extracted a ballet from this work which was produced at the Théatre des Arts; the work was written at Valvins for my young friends Mimie and Jean Godebski. Gaspard de la nuit, piano pieces after Aloysius Bertrand,”! are three romantic poems of transcendental virtuosity.\n\nThe title Valses nobles et sentimentales sufficiently indicates my intention of composing a series of waltzes in imitation of Schubert. The virtuosity which forms the basis of Gaspard de la nuit gives way to a markedly clearer kind of writing, which crystallizes the harmony and sharpens the profile of the music. The Valses nobles et sentimentales were first performed amid protestations and boos at a concert of the Société Musicale Indépendante, in which the names of the composers were not revealed. The audience voted on the probable authorship of each piece. The authorship of my piece was recognized—by a slight majority. The seventh waltz seems to me the most characteristic.\n\nDaphnis et Chloé, a choreographic symphony in three parts, was commissioned by the director of the Ballet Russe, Serge Diaghilev. The argument is by Michel Fokine, then choreographer of the celebrated company. My intention in writing it was to compose a vast musical fresco, less concerned with archaism than with faithfulness to the Greece of my dreams, which is similar to that imagined and depicted by French artists at the end of the eighteenth century. The work is constructed symphonically according to a very strict tonal scheme by means of a few motifs; their development assures the\n\nwork’s symphonic homogeneity. Sketched in 1907,22 Daphnis was reworked several times, particularly the finale. First performed by the Ballet Russe, it is now in the repertoire of the Opéra.\n\n32\n\n: : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\nTrois Poémes de Mallarmé: 1 wished to transpose Mallarmé’s poetry into music, especially that preciosity so full of meaning and so characteristic of him. “Surgi de la croupe et du bond” is the strangest, if not the most hermetic of his sonnets. In this work, I used approximately the same instrumental ensemble that is found in Schoenberg’s Pierrot lunaire. The Trio, whose first theme has a Basque flavor, was composed entirely in 1914, at Saint-Jean-de-Luz. At the beginning of 1915 I enlisted in the army, and because of this my musical activities were interrupted until the autumn of 1917, when I was discharged. I then finished Le Tombeau de Couperin. The homage is directed less in fact to Couperin himself than to French music of the eighteenth century.” After Le Tombeau de Couperin, poor health prevented me from composing for some time. I resumed composing with La Valse, a choreographic poem, which I had first thought of even before the Rapsodie espagnole. | conceived of this work as a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling. I situated La Valse in an imperial palace, about 1855. Although essentially intended to be danced, it has only been staged until now in the Antwerp theater and at Madame Rubinstein’s** ballet performances. The Sonata for Violin and Cello dates from 1920, when I settled in Montfort Amaury. I believe that this Sonata marks a turning point in the evolution of my career. In it, thinness of texture is pushed to the extreme. Harmonic charm is renounced, coupled with an increasingly conspicuous reaction in favor of melody. On a different level, L’Enfant et les sortiléges, a lyric fantasy in two acts, also conforms to analogous preoccupations. The predominant concern with melody derives naturally from the story, which I took the liberty of treating in the spirit of an American operetta. Madame Colette’s?> fairy tale libretto justifies this liberty. The vocal line must dominate. The orchestra, though not renouncing virtuosity, is nevertheless of secondary importance. Tzigane is a virtuoso piece in the style of a Hungarian rhapsody. The Chansons madécasses seem to me to bring a new element, dramatic— indeed erotic, resulting from the subject matter of Parny’s poems.?° The songs form a sort of quartet in which the voice plays the role of the principal instrument. Simplicity is all-important. The independence of the part writing is pronounced, and it will be even more conspicuous in the Sonata for Violin and Piano. I asserted this independence in writing a sonata for violin and piano, instruments which are in my opinion essentially incompatible. Far from balancing their contrasts, the Sonata reveals their incompatibility.\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 33\n\nIn 1928, I composed a Boléro for orchestra at the request of Madame Rubinstein. It is a dance in a very moderate tempo and absolutely uniform with regard to the melody, harmony, and the rhythm, which is marked unceasingly by the snare drum. The only element of variety is provided by the orchestral crescendo. This is my essential work until now; in a future which I cannot foresee, I plan to write a concerto for piano and orchestra?’ and a large vocal work based on Joseph Delteil’s Jeanne d’Arc.28\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Roland-Manuel, “Une Esquisse autobiographique de Maurice Ravel,” La Revue musicale (December 1938), pp. 17-23. 2. The pseudonym of Alexis Manuel Lévy (1891-1966), French musicologist, composer, and critic. Introduced to Ravel by Erik Satie in 1911, he studied composition with Ravel and soon became one of his closest associates (see plate 2). 3. Following the publication of the Autobiographical Sketch, Roland-Manuel made two additions to the text, which are inserted in the copy of La Revue musicale in the Music Division of the Bibliothéque Nationale. These revisions (on the “Habanera” and Miroirs) will be found in notes 13 and 17 below. 4. A copy of the birth certificate is reproduced in Orenstein, Ravel: Man and Musician, plate 1, following page 218. It states that on March 8, 1875, at noon, Gracieuse Billac, aged 50, an illiterate fishmonger, appeared at the Town Hall of Ciboure. She declared that Marie Delouart, the wife of Pierre Joseph Ravel, presently living in Ciboure at 12 rue du Quai, gave birth to a male infant at 10:00 P.M. the previous evening, and wished to name him Joseph Maurice. 5. In May 1882, shortly after his seventh birthday, Maurice took his first piano lesson with Henry Ghys (1839-1908), who observed that his young pupil appeared to be “intelligent.” Emile Decombes, a professor at the Conservatoire, was the young musician’s second piano teacher. On June 2, 1889, twenty-four of his pupils, among them Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot, performed excerpts from various piano concerti in a recital at Salle Erard. Maurice played an excerpt from Moscheles’ Third Concerto, thus marking his earliest known public performance. 6. In a letter to Roland-Manuel, Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes, wrote about the coherence and melodic originality found in Ravel’s earliest compositions: ““There was a genuine unity in his artistic development; his conception of music was natural for him, and not, as with so many others, the result of effort” (Roland-Manuel,A la gloire de Ravel, Paris: Editions de la Nouvelle Revue Critique, 1938, p. 27). 7. Professor Eugéne Anthiéme observed that his pupil was “rather gifted” and would progress well with serious effort. In July 1890, Maurice received second prize in the final competition of the academic year, and in July 1891 he was awarded first prize, thus enabling him to advance to the class of Charles de Bériot. Ravel’s first prize—the\n\n34\n\n: : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\nsecond prize went to none other than Alfred Cortot—turned out to be the only one he would ever receive at the Conservatoire. 8. In the fall of 1891, Maurice entered the piano class of Charles de Bériot (18331914) and the harmony class of Emile Pessard (1843-1917). Because of his repeated failures to win a prize, as required by the bylaws of the Conservatoire, he was dismissed from both classes inJuly 1895. On the basis of Professor Bériot’s reports, it appears that Ravel played a wide variety of nineteenth-century music in a spirited, highly emotional manner. He was capable of performing well when he practiced, but when he did not, which was often the case, his playing appears to have exasperated his teacher. g. Most of Ravel’s early works written in the 1890s, which were long considered lost, were recovered by this writer and published by Salabert in 1975. In addition to the Sérénade grotesque (piano, c. 1893), and the Ballade de la Reine morte d’aimer (voice and piano, poem by Roland de Marés, c. 1893), other compositions include Sites auriculaires (two pianos, 1895-97, consisting of “Habanera” and “Entre cloches”), a Sonata for Violin and Piano (in one movement, 1897), Chanson du rouet (voice and piano, poem by Leconte de Lisle, 1898), Si morne! (voice and piano, poem by Emile Verhaeren, 1898), and the Overture to Shéhérazade (orchestra, 1898). Sites auriculaires and the Overture to Shéhérazade were performed but once in Ravel’s lifetime and promptly retracted. All of the other works were given their world premiére at Charles S. Colden Auditorium in Queens College, Flushing, New York, on February 23, 1975, in a concert which was recorded live by the Musical Heritage Society (MHS 3581). 10. At first, Professor Pessard found his student to be “a rather good harmonist,” who had some “natural ability.” Soon after, however, it appears that Maurice arrived late to class, and although “very gifted,” he was also “somewhat heedless” with regard to his work. Reading between the lines of Professor Pessard’s reports, one gets the impression that Ravel quickly assimilated everything the good professor had to teach and was captivated by harmonies which were far in advance of those taught in class. Nevertheless, he thoroughly assimilated Henri Reber’s Traité d’harmonie (which was approved by the Conservatoire in 1862) and its supplement by Théodore Dubois (1889). 11. In February 1893 Ravel and Ricardo Vifies performed the Trois Valses romantiques for Chabrier (1841-1894). The meeting made a lasting impression on Ravel, who maintained a lifelong interest in Chabrier’s music. 12. In the early 1890s, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie (1866-1925), who was leading a Bohemian life in Montmartre and playing the piano at the Café de la Nouvelle Athénes. Satie’s colorful personality and unorthodox music made a strong impression on the young musician, who would later take pleasure in furthering his colleague’s career. In the postwar years, Satie aligned himself with the younger generation and turned against his former benefactor. Despite this, Ravel continued to treat him with deference. 13. Additional statement by Roland-Manuel: “I believe that the ‘Habanera,’ with its ostinato pedal point and its chords with multiple appoggiaturas, contains the germ of several elements which were to predominate in my later compositions.” Among these elements, one may note the influence of Spain and of dance rhythms. Furthermore, a\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 35\n\nsimilar type of harmonic language is found in “Noctuelles” (Miroirs) and “Le Gibet” (Gaspard de la nuit). 14. Gédalge (1856-1926) joined the faculty of the Conservatoire in 1905, and his Traité de la fugue was used as the standard text for the study of counterpoint. A distinguished pedagogue, he taught many composers, among them Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, and Florent Schmitt. Upon learning of Gédalge’s death, Ravel wrote the following brief homage: I heard the news in Oslo; it was a severe blow. You may not understand everything that Gédalge meant to me: he taught me to realize the possibilities and structural attempts which may be seen in my earliest works. His teaching was of unusual clarity: with him, one understood immediately that technique is not simply a scholastic abstraction. Friendship was not the only reason that I dedicated the Trio to him: the homage goes directly to the teacher. (La Revue musicale, March 1, 1926, p. 255.) 15. The cordial, liberal atmosphere of Fauré’s class has been compared to that of Mallarmé’s salon. Fauré (1845-1924) followed Ravel’s career with keen interest, and Ravel reciprocated this affection, dedicating Jeux d’eau and the String Quartet to his “dear teacher” (see plate 3). Fauré’s final class report, written in June 1900, offers a perspicacious description of his twenty-five-year-old student: “Very good student, hardworking and punctual. Musical nature very taken with innovation, with a disarming sincerity!” Despite this encouragement, Ravel was expelled from his composition class in July 1go00, as he failed to win a prize in two consecutive fugue competitions. (One fugue was given a zero by the director of the Conservatoire, Théodore Dubois, with the following comment: “Impossible, owing to terrible inaccuracies in writing.”) Nevertheless, Ravel continued to participate in Fauré’s class as an auditor. Listed in the Conservatoire’s registry as a “former student,” he remained an auditor until 1903, when he left the Conservatoire for the last time. 16. Actually, Ravel entered the Prix de Rome competition for the first time in May 1900. After submitting a fugue and a choral piece, Les Bayaderes, he was eliminated in the preliminary round. (The autographs of all his Prix de Rome essays are found in the Music Division of the Bibliothéque Nationale.) 17. Additional statement by Roland-Manuel:\n\nThe title Miroirs (Mirrors), five piano pieces composed in 1905, has authorized my critics to consider this collection among those works which belong to the impressionist movement. I do not contradict this at all, if one understands the term by analogy. A rather fleeting analogy, moreover, since impressionism does not seem to have any precise meaning outside the domain of painting. In any case, the word Mirror should not lead one to assume that I wish to affirm a subjectivistic theory of art. A sentence by Shakespeare helped me to formulate a completely opposite position: . . . ‘the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things.’ (u/ius Caesar, act I, scene 2.)\n\n36\n\n: : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n18. The Journal of Jules Renard (1864-1910) contains the following entry for January 12, 1907: M. Ravel, the composer of the Histoires naturelles, dark, rich, and elegant, urges me to go and hear his songs tonight. I told him I knew nothing about music, and asked him what he had been able to add to the Histoires naturelles. He replied: I did not intend to add anything, only to interpret them. But in what way? I have tried to say in music what you say with words, when you are in front of a tree, for example. I think and feel in music, and should like to think and feel the same things as you. There is instinctive, sentimental music, like mine—naturally you must learn your craft first—and intellectual music, like [Vincent] d’Indy’s. The audience this evening will consist mainly of d’Indys; they don’t recognize feeling and don’t wish to explain it. I take the opposite view, but they must find my work interesting since they are willing to program it. This test tonight is very important for me. In any case I can rely on my interpreter [Jane Bathori]: she is excellent. (Jules Renard, Journal, edited by Léon Guichard and Gilbert Sigaux, Paris: Librairie Gallimard, 1960, pp. 1100-01.) 19. The pen name of Maurice-Etienne Legrand (1873-1934). Nohain is the name of a river near Corbigny, the author’s birthplace. His work often contains curious rhymes, humorous situations, and charming buffoonery, all of which abound in the libretto of L’Heure espagnole. This one-act comedy was first performed in 1904 at the Odéon theater with marked success. Ravel wrote to Franc-Nohain, requesting permission to adapt the play. The author, like Jules Renard, was amazed that anyone would consider setting his work to music, but willingly gave his permission. 20. Inadvertently dated 1918 in the text. 21. The reputation of Aloysius Bertrand (1807-1841) rests entirely upon Gaspard de la nuit, which was written about 1830 and published posthumously in 1842. The complete texts of “Ondine,” “Le Gibet,” and “Scarbo” appear in the Durand edition, and the hauntingly evocative Romanticism of Bertrand’s visions are remarkably interpreted in these descriptive tone poems. 22. Much ink has been spilled over this date. Roland-Manuel wrote in a footnote: “Ravel is mistaken by two years. The inaccuracy is indisputable as the Ballet Russe appeared for the first time in 1909.” Indeed, Ravel’s letter to Madame René de SaintMarceaux indicates that initial work on the ballet libretto began in June, 1909 (see letter no. 64). However, Serge Lifar claimed that Diaghilev and Ravel met in 1906, and it was thus possible that some work on Daphnis—perhaps not as yet conceived of as a ballet— might have been carried out before 1909. (Serge Lifar, “Maurice Ravel et le Ballet,” La Revue musicale, December 1938, p. 75.) 23. Nevertheless, in 1914, while working on Le Tombeau de Couperin, Ravel returned to the world of eighteenth-century French music by writing a piano transcription of a forlane by Francois Couperin (1668-1733), taken from the chamber music entitled Concerts royaux. (The transcription has been printed in my article “Some Unpublished Music,” pp. 330-31.)\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 37\n\n24. The Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein (1885-1960) began her career in Diaghilev’s Ballet Russe and later formed her own company. She was also a generous patroness of the arts. Among the ballets she introduced were Debussy’s Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien (1911), Schmitt’s La Tragédie de Salomé (1919), d’Indy’s Istar (1924), Honegger’s L'Impératrice aux rochers (1927), and Stravinsky’s Le Baiser de la fée (1928). 25. The celebrated author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (1873-1954) frequently wrote about life as she had experienced it, from her childhood in Burgundy to her career as a mime dancer in the music halls of Paris. The enchanting world of animals, particularly cats, is another important motif in her work, and herein lies an important link between the librettist and the composer of L’Enfant et les sortiléges. The work was introduced at the Monte Carlo Opera in March, 1925, some twenty-five years after Colette and Ravel first met. 26. The Chansons madécasses, twelve poems in prose by Evariste-Désiré de Parny (1753-1814), appeared in 1787. Although Parny claimed to have collected and translated several songs of the Madagascan natives, the fact is that he never set foot in Madagascar and did not speak Malagasy. Ravel considered his cycle of three songs to be one of his most important postwar compositions, as it achieved a maximum of expression while utilizing a marked economy of means. 27. Following the Boléro, Ravel completed three works: two piano concerti, one for the left hand and the other in G Major, and the song cycle Don Quichotte a Dulcinée, based on the poems by Paul Morand. 28. Although Jeanne d’Arc was not even partially sketched, Ravel discussed it at length in an interview printed in Excelsior on September 24, 1933 (see p. 499). Ravel and Delteil (1894-1977) were on cordial terms, and the composer’s library contains several personally dedicated books by the author, including two copies of Jeanne dArc (Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1925 and 1926).\n\nSome Reflections on Music’\n\nhave never felt the need to formulate, either for the benefit of\n\nothers or for myself, the principles of my aesthetic. If I were called upon to do so, I would ask to be allowed to identify myself with the simple pronouncements made by Mozart on this subject. He confined himself to saying that there is nothing that music can not undertake to do, or dare, or portray, provided it continues to charm and always remains music.” I am sometimes credited with opinions which appear very paradoxical concerning the falsity of art and the dangers of sincerity. The fact is I refuse simply and absolutely to confound the conscience of an artist, which is one thing, with his sincerity, which is another. Sincerity is of no value unless one’s conscience helps to make it apparent. This conscience compels us to turn ourselves into good craftsmen. My objective, therefore, is technical perfection. I can strive unceasingly to this end, since I am certain of never being able to attain it. The important thing is to get nearer to it all the time. Art, no doubt, has other effects, but the artist, in my opinion, should have no other aim.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Roland-Manuel, “Lettres de Maurice Ravel,” p. 53. According to Roland-Manuel, this statement concluded the interview which resulted in the Autobiographical Sketch. 2. It is fitting that Ravel turned to Mozart for aesthetic counsel, as he revered the Austrian master above all other composers. Indeed, throughout his career, Ravel emulated Mozart’s clarity of expression, perfection of workmanship, and his unique ability to balance classical symmetry with the element of surprise. Ravel once observed that his own music was “quite simple, nothing but Mozart,” a statement which contains a goodly element of truth. In a letter to his father dated September 26, 1781, in which he discussed The Abduction from the Seraglio, Mozart wrote about Osmin’s aria in act 1 as follows:\n\nFor just as a man in such a towering rage oversteps all the bounds of order, moderation, and propriety, and completely forgets himself, so must the music too forget itself. But as passions, whether violent or not, must never be expressed in\n\n38\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 39\n\nsuch a way as to excite disgust, and as music, even in the most terrible situations, must never offend the ear, but must please the hearer, or in other words must never cease to be music, I have gone from F (the key in which the aria is written), not into a remote key, but into a related one, not, however, into its nearest relative D minor, but into the more remote A minor. (Alfred Einstein, Mozart, His Character, His Work, New York: Oxford University Press, 1962, pp. 384-85.)\n\nContemporary Music'\n\nOn April 6 and 7, 1928, at the invitation of the Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, Ravel participated in two recitals devoted to his music.” As he had previously done during his four-month tour in North America, the composer played several of his piano pieces (among them the Sonatine, “La Vallée des cloches” from Miroirs, and the “Rigaudon” from Le Tombeau de Couperin), and assisted in performing various vocal and chamber works (Shéhérazade, and the recently completed Sonata for Violin and Piano). The recital on April 7 was preceded by a lecture entitled Contemporary Music. /t is paradoxical but true that this lecture—apparently the only one Ravel ever gave—has come down to us in an English translation.* The translator is still unknown and the French text has yet to be recovered.* All of this notwithstanding, the lecture itself is of extraordinary interest. Stressing the importance ofnational and individual consciousness in the creation ofa work ofart, Ravel discusses the contemporary European musical scene, evaluating the achievements of a number of his colleagues, among them Debussy, Satie, and Les Six, interspersed with revealing observations about his own compositions and creative process. He touches upon the musical relationship ofLiszt and Wagner, the work ofBartok and Kodaly, the influence of Schoenberg, the poetry ofMallarmé, and concludes by urging his hosts to return to their roots—yjazz, blues, Negro spirituals, and so on—in order to create a genuinely American school of music. Ravel presents an optimistic survey of the contemporary scene in concise, dignified language. A personal blend of impartiality, candor, and modesty is evident throughout this remarkable lecture. tis of course impossible to offer any adequate survey of contemporary music or even of one of its phases within the space of a single lecture; moreover, I hasten to admit that there is only one thing which I should find still more difficult, and that would be to explain my own music or comment upon it; indeed, were I in position fully to explain my music, I should then be inclined to doubt its worth and value. The reasons which lead me to this conclusion are, perhaps, different from those generally cited by lecturers on art. For instance, it is often said that music defies analysis, whereas other fine arts, such as painting, sculpture, and architecture, have not a\n\n40\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 41\n\nmedium of manifestation so intangible, elusive, and evanescent as the vibration of sound. On this point I differ somewhat, because I am under the impression that current progress in acoustical science makes possible dimensional measurements of sound as many and as varied as are those of other means of artistic expression, employed, for example, in architecture. I would even say that since the young Russian scientist, Theremin, has perfected his original instruments, and can now transform ethereal vibrations into tonal vibrations of any pitch, intensity, or quality that he may desire, the sound part of music would seem to have come quite within the reach of analysis. So it is not because of the elusiveness of sound vibrations that I consider it impossible to explain or judge a work of musical art; indeed, I have the same feeling about other works of art whether in painting, sculpture, or architecture. Would it be, then, that I do not accept the so-called classical laws of harmony, counterpoint, and so on? Whether I recognize their validity or not is of little importance to me in judging contemporary compositions, for these classical laws originated in works of the past; they have been formulated and adopted by teachers in their efforts to find a permanent basis, solid and suitable, for their courses of instruction; and this\n\nbody of doctrine has undergone change after change in accommodating itself to new laws peculiar to new compositions appearing from time to time. No academic attempt to establish permanent laws, however, ever helped or hindered the advancement of work in art. The matter might be summed up by saying that in musical treatises there are no such laws as would be of any avail in judging a contemporary musical work of art. Apparently the uselessness of all such arguments must come from the fact that such would-be laws are dealing only with the obvious and superficial part of the work of art without ever reaching those infinitely minute roots of the artist’s sensitiveness and personal reaction. The elusive roots, or sources, are often sensed as two in character:\n\none might be called the national consciousness, its territory being rather extensive; while the other, the individual consciousness,\n\nseems\n\nto be the\n\nproduct of an egocentric process. Both defy classification and analysis as well, yet every sensitive artist perceives the value of their influence in the creation of a real work of art. The manifestation of these two types of consciousness in music may break or satisfy all the academic rules, but such circumstance is of insignificant importance compared with the real aim, namely, fullness and sincerity of expression. We have here to do, perhaps, with that inner motion which purposely sets our intelligence and perception to seek its own development in its own atmosphere and tradition—not its historical tradition, but the tradition which heredity makes one feel to be true to one’s nature. Such search may be intensively selective, and then becomes a clearing process applied to our natural gifts and supervised by our individual consciousness. Here, again, I insist that no stated laws can be given whereby to judge the degree of perfection\n\n42\n\n: : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\nattained in this process on the part of the individual, inasmuch as what we are attempting to discover is only sensed and as yet unknown. So were I able to explain and demonstrate the value of my own works, it would then prove, at least from my personal point of view, that they are constructed altogether of obvious, superficial, tangible elements within easy reach of formal analysis, and, therefore, that these works of mine are not perfect works of art. The difficulty remains when one attempts either to classify or to state definitely relative estimates of one’s contemporaries in music, not excepting those among one’s own countrymen. Indeed, from this point of view, any attempt to arrive at a definite judgment with respect to a work of art seems to me to be folly. On the initial performance of a new musical composition, the first impression of the public is generally one of reaction to the more superficial elements of its music, that is to say, to its external manifestations rather than to its inner content. The listener is impressed by some unimportant peculiarity in the medium of expression, and yet the idiom of expression, even if considered in its completeness, is only the means and not the end in itself, and often it is not until years after, when the means of expression have finally surrendered all their secrets, that the real inner emotion of the music becomes apparent to the listener. Thus, for example, if we consider present-day reviews of the compositions of Arnold Schoenberg and Darius Milhaud, it often seems as though chromatism and atonality on the one hand, and diatonism versus polytonality on the other, were the only significant traits of these two artists; nevertheless, in either case, it often seems as though such a judgment would reveal but the garb concealing or adorning their emotional sensitiveness, and we should always remember that sensitiveness and emotion constitute the real content of a work of art. Furthermore, the acute and subtle perception guiding the artist in his creative work is itself in continuous evolution, for, just as any of the ordinary\n\nsenses may be trained and made to perceive better to-day than yesterday, so this perception within the individual and national heritage of atmosphere and tradition may become keener and keener year after year, leaving no place for standardized and permanent classification. I may be able to express my thought more perfectly if we consider briefly these ideas of nationalism and individualism in their relations to music. And what I hazard to express in this connection is my individual understanding of the more striking characteristics of contemporary music as exhibited in the works of some of my friends. At all events, I hope in this way to illustrate my thought more adequately. For example, in the works of Darius Milhaud, probably the most important of our younger French composers, one is frequently impressed by the vastness of the composer’s conceptions. This quality of Milhaud’s music is far more individual than his use, so frequently commented upon, and often criticised, of\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 43\n\npolytonality (a conception of the simultaneous use of several tonalities, of which we may find embryonic examples as early as the chorals ofJ.S. Bach, in certain passages of Beethoven, and in the definite use thereof by Richard Strauss). If we consider broadly one of his larger works, the “Choéphores,” we soon discover that on attaining the climax of a series of utterances tragic in character, in the course of which the most sweeping use is made of all the resources of musical composition, including polytonal writing, Milhaud nevertheless reaches still profounder depths of his own artistic consciousness in a scene where a strong pathetic psalmody is accompanied only by percussion. Here it is no longer polytonality which expresses Milhaud, and yet this is one of the pages where Milhaud most profoundly reveals himself. Of similar significance is the fact that in one of his latest works, Les Malheurs d’Orphée, in its recent American premiére at one of the New York concerts of Pro Musica, Milhaud’s occasional use of polytonality is so intricately interwoven with lyric and poetic elements as to be scarcely distinguishable, while his acknowledged artistic personality reappears clothed with a certain clarity of melodic design altogether Gallic in character. Again, we might note the singularly dramatic qualities of Delannoy, the facile and popular musical content of works of Poulenc, the accuracy of form and elegance of orchestration in Roland-Manuel, and the peculiar tendency on the part of G. Auric to etch his music sharply, often to the point of an acute and satiric vein. Such inherent and widely divergent traits appertain to different individuals rather than to a single school; and this could also be said of the genial music of Germaine Tailleferre. In Arthur Honegger, still another member of what a French critic has labeled the Groupe des Six, we find, not only individual traits, but hereditary and racial characteristics altogether different from those of the four composers just mentioned, and this racial consciousness of Honegger he expresses without reserve. From his musical education, received at the hands of French teachers on French soil, Honegger seems to have conserved a facility in writing which he uses for self-expression along the lines of German expansiveness, and his music remains true to his racial consciousness—that is to say, the German consciousness, for he was born of German-\n\nSwiss parentage. The latter statement is meant neither in a derogatory sense, nor in one of praise; it simply says that, while we can reconcile the various tendencies expressed by Milhaud, Poulenc, and Auric, as being all equally rooted in French national consciousness,\n\nit is from the German\n\nnational\n\nconsciousness that the art of Honegger springs. If we should consider still other young French musicians, we should find this phase of racial consciousness again in evidence; for we should not find the German character in the curiously dramatic qualities of M. Delannoy’s music, or in the refined and\n\nintimate music of Roland-Manuel. This national consciousness of musicians distinctively German is expansive,\n\n44:\n\n: : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\nwhile our French consciousness is one of reserve. In virtue of the indissoluble ties binding each to his respective national consciousness, it is, of course, inconceivable that either one should be able to express himself adequately in the language of the other. Nationalism does not deprive the composer either of his personal soul or of its individual expression, for each creative artist has within him laws peculiar to his own being. These laws, peculiar to the artist himself, are, perhaps, the most momentous elements at play in the whole process of musical creation; they seem to be determined through an interplay of national and individual consciousness; and they can be imparted to the artist by no teacher, for they spring from his own heritage, and are first perceived only by himself. Such laws in the course of years may become those of a school, of pupils, or imitators, or of followers, but whenever a real artist appears, he evolves from his own consciousness new laws peculiar to himself. Incidentally, I should like to remark that musicians who are true alike to their national consciousness and to their own individuality often appreciate compositions altogether different from their own, but a Germanized French musician or a Gallicized musician of Germany will have a tendency to fail in understanding the musical works of others—the hybrid failing to recognize other personalities because of the loss of its own individuality. If we should now consider our lawful portion of inheritance from other musicians, the evident value of such a heritage, and the eventual danger of plagiarism, I should place on the legitimate side exchanges in emotional expression, the influence of experimental or incomplete compositions, which may be absorbed or assimilated without loss either of individual or of national consciousness; while, on the opposite side, I would put all efforts, either through imitation or plagiarism, to conceal absence or weakness of personality. It may sometimes be extremely difficult to decide these questions with respect to a particular work, but here again, the keen perception of the artist is the only dependable guide. Perhaps one of the most curious cases of exchanges of influence is that of Hérold, Weber, and Rossini; these three composers were strongly influenced in turn by a common characteristic of their respective works—namely, their romanticism; but each of the three held these interchanges of influence subservient to his own respective national consciousness. It was French romantic music that Hérold wrote, Rossini’s romanticism was obviously Italian, while Weber remained to the end a German romanticist. Such influences enlarge the horizon of the aspiring artist without contracting either his personality or his heritage. Relations of this sort in works of some of my predecessors or contemporaries I shall be pointing out later on in this lecture. It is very important to estimate these influences carefully, inasmuch as they may be of good or ill effect, depending upon the\n\nquality of the influence and even more upon the strength of the personality subjected to them. For example, the influence of Liszt on Wagner was al-\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 45\n\ntogether considerable, and yet the personality of the latter was in no way impaired, despite the generous way in which he used the artistic heritage of his father-in-law. The thematic influence of Liszt on Wagner is certainly more than obvious, but the zsthetic of Wagner, however extensive, is essentially individual. Another significant influence, somewhat unique, and deriving at\n\nleast partially from Chabrier, is that of Erik Satie, which has had appreciable effect upon Debussy, myself, and indeed most of the modern French composers. Satie was possessed of an extremely keen intelligence. His was the inventor’s mind par excellence. He was a great experimenter. His experiments may never have reached the degree of development or realization attained by Liszt; but, alike in multiplicity and importance, these experiments have been of inestimable value. Simply and ingeniously Satie pointed the way, but as soon as another musician took to the trail he had indicated, Satie would immediately change his own orientation and without hesitation open up still another path to new fields of experimentation. He thus became the inspiration of countless progressive tendencies; and while he himself may, perhaps, never have wrought out of his own discoveries a single complete work of art, nevertheless we have to-day many such works which might not have come into existence if Satie had never lived. This influence of his was not in the least dogmatic, and, for this reason, of all the greater value to other musicians. Debussy held him in the highest esteem. Influences such as his are as fertile soil, propitious to the growth of rare flowers, wherein the individual consciousness, the indispensable seed, nourished in better surroundings thus provided, may still unfold according to its own essential nature, national, racial, or individual.\n\nAs often as not, the national consciousness is the creative artist’s original source of inspiration. For example, the objectivity and clarity of design exhibited by our earliest composers furnished a rich heritage to our incomparable C. A. Debussy, the most phenomenal genius in the history of French music. Does this mean to say that Debussy was only an imitator? Certainly not! Again, is the symbolism of Debussy, his so-called impressionism, at variance with the Gallic spirit? Quite the contrary, because beneath the fine and delicate lacework of atmospheric surface, one may easily discover a refined precision of design, characteristically French. His genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition. For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy, and while I consider that Debussy may not have been altogether alien to my personal inheritance, I should identify also with the earlier phase of my evolution Gabriel Fauré, Emmanuel\n\nChabrier, and Erik Satie. The exsthetic of\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, your great American, has been of singular importance to me, and also the immaterial poetry of Mallarmé—unbounded visions, yet precise in\n\n46 : : : Ravel’s Career and Musical Thought design, enclosed in a mystery of sombre abstractions—an art where all the elements are so intimately bound up together that one cannot analyze, but only sense, its effect. Nevertheless I believe that I myself have always followed a direction opposite to that of Debussy’s symbolism. Let us now turn to another aspect of my own work which may be of more immediate interest to you. To my mind, the “blues” is one of your greatest musical assets, truly American despite earlier contributory influences from Africa and Spain. Musicians have asked me how I came to write “blues” as the second movement of my recently completed sonata for violin and piano. Here again the same process, to which I have already alluded, is in evidence, for, while I adopted this popular form of your music, I venture to say that nevertheless it is French music, Ravel’s music, that I have written. Indeed, these popular forms are but the materials of construction, and the work of art appears only on mature conception where no detail has been left to chance. Moreover, minute\n\nstylization in the manipulation of these materials is altogether essential. ‘To understand more fully what I mean by the process to which I refer, it would be sufficient to have these same “blues” treated by some of your own musicians and by musicians of European countries other than France, when you would certainly find the resulting compositions to be widely divergent, most of them bearing the national characteristics of their respective composers, despite the unique nationality of their initial material, the American “blues”. Think of the striking and essential differences to be noted in the “jazz” and “rags” of Milhaud, Stravinsky, Casella, Hindemith, and so on. The individualities of\n\nthese composers are stronger than the materials appropriated. They mould popular forms to meet the requirements of their own individual art. Again— nothing left to chance; again—minute stylization of the materials employed, while the styles become as numerous as the composers themselves. In my own work of composition I find a long period of conscious gestation, in general, necessary. During this interval, I come gradually to see, and with growing precision, the form and evolution which the subsequent work should have as a whole. I may thus be occupied for years without writing a single note of the work—after which the writing goes relatively rapidly; but there is still much time to be spent in eliminating everything that might be regarded as superfluous, in order to realize as completely as possible the longed-for final clarity. Then comes the time when new conceptions have to be formulated for further composition, but these cannot be forced artificially, for they come only of their own free will, and often originate in some very remote perception, without manifesting themselves until long years after. For the last fifteen or twenty years musicians and critics alike have taken great interest in the two divergent tendencies I have already mentioned: atonality and polytonality. And in the impassioned discussions of partisans we have\n\nRavel's Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 47\n\noften heard or read that atonality is a blind alley leading nowhere, but I do not accept the validity of this opinion; because, while as a system it may be so, it certainly cannot be as an influence. In fact, the influence of Schoenberg may be overwhelming on his followers, but the significance of his art is to be identified with influences of a more subtle kind—not the system, but the esthetic, of his\n\nart. 1am quite conscious of the fact that my Chansons madécasses are in no way Schoenbergian, but I do not know whether I ever should have been able to write them had Schoenberg never written. On the other hand, it has often been said that my music has influenced many of my contemporaries. In particular it has been claimed with some insistence that the earlier appearance of my Jeux d'eau possibly influenced Debussy in the writing of his Jardins sous la pluie, while a coincidence, even more striking, has been suggested in the case of my Habanera; but comments of this sort I must leave to others. It could very well be, however, that conceptions, apparently similar in character, should mature in the consciousness of two different composers at almost the same time without implying direct influence of either one upon the other. In such case, the compositions may have numerous external analogies, but we can feel the difference in individuality of the two composers, just as no two human beings are ever altogether identical—considering of course at the moment only those composers who have actually sought and discovered their own personality. Again, if under apparently similar outward expression we fail to find dissimilar inner manifestations, it is likely that one of the two composers is a plagiarist of\n\nthe other.\n\n;\n\nBut we have been wandering somewhat from the subject of our lecture, and,\n\nperhaps, for no better reason than that I am unable to say much more about my own compositions and the methods by which they have been brought into being. When the first stroke of a work has been written, and the process of elimination begun, the severe effort toward perfection proceeds by means almost intangible, seemingly directed by currents of inner forces, so intimate and intricate in character as to defy all analysis. Real art, I repeat, is not to be recognized by definitions, or revealed by analysis: we sense its manifestations and we feel its presence: it is apprehended in no other way. Before closing this short address I wish to say again how very happy I am in visiting your country, and all the more so because my journey is enabling me to become still more conversant with those elements which are contributing to the gradual formation of a veritable school of American music. That this school will become notable in its final evolution I have not the slightest doubt, and I am also convinced that it will realize a national expression quite as different from the music of Europeans as you yourselves are different from them. Here again, for the nurture of the most sensitive and imaginative of our young composers we should consider national heritage in all its entirety. There are always self-\n\n48 : : : Ravel's Career and Musical Thought appointed promoters of nationalism in plenty, who profess their creed with a vengeance, but rarely do they agree as to the means to be employed. Among these nationalists in music we can always distinguish two distinct clans constantly waging their warfare of criticism. Now criticism is easy, but art is difficult. Most of these nationalists are painstaking enough in criticism, but few of them are sufficiently so in self-examination. One group believes that folklore is the only requisite to national music; the other predicts the birth of national music in the individual of to-day. Meanwhile, within the first clan itself dissension goes on: “Folk-lore? But what in particular is our folk-lore? Indian tunes? But are they American? . . . Negro spirituals? Blues? But are these American?” and so on, until nothing is left of national background. And the field is at last wide open for those musicians whose greatest fear is to find themselves confronted by mysterious urges to break academic rules rather than belie individual consciousness. Thereupon these musicians, good bourgeois as they are, compose their music according to the classical rules of the European epoch, while the folk-lorists, apostles of popular airs, shout in their purism: “Can this be American music if inspired by Europe?” We are thus caught up in a vicious and unproductive circle, unless we turn once more to the past and consider how certain works, held to be essentially national in character, were produced. Wagner is generally regarded as purely Germanic and yet, as we have already remarked, a great deal of his thematic material was derived from the highly imaginative Franz Liszt, a Hungarian whose own works often and indubitably exhibit a rich flavor of Hungarian folk-lore. It is quite certain that Wagner’s remarkable achievement depended upon his success in formulating his own style of manifestation, yet one may doubt that he would ever have written as he did if the abundant wealth of material accumulated by Liszt had not been more or less at his disposal. For example, to the completion of such a work as Tristan und Isolde, Wagner’s extraordinary skill in construction, Liszt’s\n\nunusual thematic genius, and folk-lore as well—all made contribution. Folklore and individual consciousness are alike necessary; and, in nations that are still young from a musical point of view, persistent fidelity of search in these two directions seems to be the greatest lack on the part of composers. With respect to individual consciousness let us not deceive ourselves: its discovery and development is more often than not a lifelong process. Nor should individuality ever be confused with eccentricity. Now, as to collecting the popular songs of which the national folk-lore is made up, I could do no better than cite the remarkable record of two distinguished Hungarian musicians, Béla Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly, in personality altogether unlike, but mutually interested in folklore. These gentlemen, from 1905 to 1918, collected more than twelve thousand such songs of Hungary and adjacent countries. Of this number at least six thousand are Hungarian, and Bart6k says that he could easily collect an\n\nRavel’s Career and Musical Thought\n\n: : : 49\n\nadditional thousand every year. Moreover, while assembling in tangible form this incomparable national heritage of Hungarian musicians, Messrs. Bartok and Kodaly have with equally painstaking care preserved the quality of its material in accurate documentary form by recording the songs on gramophone disks, which are capable of catching and holding permanently the most elusive of folk-lore characteristics, including small variations in pitch, intensity, and quality of sound, for which the cruder medium of our ordinary written musical notation is utterly inadequate. In conclusion I would say that even if negro music is not of purely American origin, nevertheless I believe it will prove to be an effective factor in the founding of an American school of music. At all events, may this national American music of yours embody a great deal of the rich and diverting rhythm of your jazz, a great deal of the emotional expression in your blues, and a great deal of the sentiment and spirit characteristic of your popular melodies and songs, worthily deriving from, and in turn contributing to, a noble national heritage in music.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

Give my kind regards to Mme and Mlle Marnold, and believe me, dear Monsieur Marnold, Very sincerely yours,\n\nMaurice Ravel 1. Cofounder of the Mercure musical and critic for the Mercure de France, Jean Marnold (1859-1935) was an ardent supporter of Ravel and soon became a trusted friend. 2. The Jntroduction and Allegro, for harp, accompanied by string quartet, flute, and clarinet, was dedicated to Albert Blondel, the director of the Erard Company, which supplied the Conservatoire with its harps and pianos. 3. During the stormy events surrounding the Prix de Rome competition, Ravel accepted an invitation from his friends Alfred and Misia Edwards to join them aboard their luxurious yacht Aimée for an extended vacation in Belgium, Holland, and Germany. (The monogram of Misia Edwards, seen above, is similar to Ravel’s ITA, which is often found on his personal stationery and printed scores.)\n\n4. In an article entitled “Le Scandale du Prix de Rome” (Mercure de France, June 1, 1905, pp. 466-69), Marnold attacked the Prix de Rome jury’s decision to eliminate Ravel in the preliminary round of the competition. Is it possible, he asked, that the composer of Jeux d’eau and the String Quartet was incapable of writing an academic fugue and a choral piece, after having been a finalist in three previous competitions?\n\nCorrespondence\n\n: : : 69\n\nFurthermore, he explained, all of the six finalists were pupils of the same professor of composition, Charles Lenepveu, who was concomitantly a member of the Prix de Rome jury! Marnold wrote: “We must know, if, for now and all time, awards are to be extorted by intrigue or conferred by imbeciles. . . . For the future of our music, it is high time to sweep away this clique of pedants, equivocators, and spiteful cads.” As a result of this scandal, Ravel was catapulted to fame, Théodore Dubois resigned as director of the\n\nConservatoire and was replaced by Gabriel Fauré, and the curriculum of the Conseryatoire underwent considerable revision. 5- In 1905, the Ravel family moved to the Parisian suburb of Levallois Perret.\n\n17. to Maurice Delage Maastricht June 15, 1905 First impression of Holland.

The bridge is being caulked and something—I don’t know what—is being prepared in anticipation of the next few crossings. We have been here 3 days and I still haven’t been to the museums. There are so many things to see. Amsterdam is completely different than I imagined it: a mass of multicolored houses with figured gables; palaces and modern monuments which are peculiar in color and architecture. There are canals everywhere. The entire city is built on piles, which give it terrific character, but in fact make a horrible stench. Upon arriving, I hurried to the zoo and the aquarium. I feel that I will return there several times. Yesterday, an excursion to Alkmaar: a cheese market with carillons ringing ceaselessly. En route, a most magnificent sight: a lake bordered by windmills, and in the fields, windmills as far as the horizon. No matter where you looked, you saw nothing but revolving vanes. Viewing this mechanical landscape, you could end up believing yourself to be an automaton.\n\n70\n\n: : : Correspondence\n\nWith all that, I don’t need to tell you that I’m not doing a thing. But I am storing things up, and I believe that a lot will come out of this trip. In any case, I am perfectly happy for the moment, and it was very wrong of me to alarm you in a moment of despair. You know how capable I am of taking the most tragic things, and, good heavens, there are worse things than that! Write to Amsterdam. We’re supposed to remain here one more week. I shake your paw affectionately. Maurice Ravel 1. Referring to the Prix de Rome fiasco.\n\n1g. to Maurice Delage On the Rhine, towards Diisseldorf\n\nYACHT\n\namée\n\nJuly 5, 1905\n\nMy dear friend,\n\nSince yesterday we have been in Germany, on the German Rhine. It isn’t the tragic and legendary Rhine I imagined at all: lacking are water nymphs, gnomes, and Valkyries, with castles! on steep cliffs amidst pine trees, Hugo,” Wagner, and Gustave Doré.? It’s rather like that a bit farther down, towards Cologne, it seems. For the moment, it is as interesting, perhaps even more so. What I saw yesterday will remain embedded in my memory, as will the harbor in Antwerp. After a lazy day on a very wide river between hopelessly flat banks devoid of character, we came upon a city of chimneys and domes spewing forth flames as well as reddish and blue fumes. It was Ahaus, a gigantic foundry in which 24,000 men work night and day. As Ruhrort was too far, we went ashore here. So much the better, or else we would have missed an extraordinary sight. We went down to the mills at nightfall. How can I tell you about these smelting castles, these incandescent cathedrals, and the wonderful symphony of traveling belts, whistles, and terrific hammerblows which envelop you? And everywhere the sky is a scorching, deep red. Then, a storm broke out. We returned horribly drenched, in different moods. Ida* was terrified and wanted to cry. So did I, but for joy. How much music there is in all of this! —and I\n\ncertainly intend to use it.5 We left this morning in rainy weather. The sun was very pale and high up. Blue masses continually broke through the yellow fog. Then, we perceived something like huge, enchanted palaces, which turned out to be the monumental factories which dot the region. The landscape is now becoming more peaceful, with river banks flat once\n\nCorrespondence\n\n: : : 71\n\nagain, and small forests appearing from time to time. We expect to sleep at Diisseldorf tonight. Write to me in Frankfurt, it will be safer. We should be there in 5 or 6 days. I shake your paw affectionately. Maurice Ravel We are in sight of Diisseldorf. 1. Ravel used the German word “Burg,” which means a castle. 2. Victor Hugo wrote about a trip through the Rhineland in his work Le Rhin (1842). 3. The gifted nineteenth-century French painter and sculptor Gustave Doré was a prolific illustrator of books. 4. Ida Godebska. See letter no. 22, note 1. 5. Ravel’s unfinished opera, La Cloche engloutie (The Sunken Bell), based on the play by Gerhardt Hauptmann, was described by its translator and librettist André Ferdinand Hérold as follows: The scenes which occur in the factory of Henry the founder were to have been of striking power. Ravel did not envision a small artisan’s workshop; he imagined a huge factory, equipped like the most grandiose one sees today, and he would have utilized the innumerable sounds of hammers, saws, files, and sirens. (A. Ferdinand Hérold, “Souvenirs,” La Revue musicale, December 1938, p. 198.)\n\n20. to Maurice Delage Frankfurt\n\nJuly 12 [1905]\n\nWe arrived last night. I’ve already seen the museum, which contains a wonderful Rembrandt, some Cranachs, and above all, a Velazquez! As for the\n\nold city, it’s incredible. It’s so well preserved that it seems faked. A host of memories: the birth houses of Goethe, Rothschild, and Luther; the house in\n\nwhich the 1870 peace was signed. I had lunch in a magnificent garden. In brief, a day which could have been exceptionally splendid, but for my preoccupation with letters from you and Sordes.! Come now, old chap, both of you, and you especially, who know the slightly ridiculous aspect of my personality—my sensibility—how could you have thought of playing such a cruel joke on me about the mission?* Couldn’t you sense the palpitation which would jolt me upon reading the news? Yes, in spite of everything, I’m accepting, I’m even accepting it terribly. The insane desire which I have for such a thing makes me believe in its reality. For after all, there is nothing impossible about it. The appointment of my teacher to an important\n\n72\n\n: : : Correspondence\n\nofficial post,? and above all, the customary worthiness of the people to whom these missions are confided, give me some hope. No, old chap, one doesn’t joke about these things, and besides, I’m sure—I would stake my life on it—that you aren’t the instigator of this hoax. Write quickly. I’m in such a state that I no longer savor anything about me. I will only be completely reassured in Cologne, where I will receive your reply if you send it immediately. We won’t stay more than 2 days in Frankfurt. [fit were true (I’m an idiot, I know), but if it is so, send me a telegram here. I know that\n\nyou won’t be angry with me for my reproaches, right? Kind regards, Maurice Ravel 1. The painter Paul Sordes, a member of the Apaches. 2. Details of this proposed mission to the Orient are found in letter no. 22. 3. Gabriel Fauré’s directorship of the Conservatoire.\n\n21. to Maurice Delage Middleburg\n\nJuly 20, 1905\n\nThis is the last city in Holland in which we spend the night, old chap. Tomorrow, we stop at Vlissingen and pick up a pilot for the crossing. Tomorrow night Ostend, where we will stay one or two days (perhaps a visit to Bruges), and we will arrive at Le Havre by sea. Thus, I will be in Paris in a few days. We’ll be together in less than a week, speaking of everything we wrote about, and then everything we didn’t write but thought about, and then, damn! I can’t conceal my joy at returning. That’s my greatest joy, despite the nostalgia of a dazzling voyage whose marvelous memories will remain with me a long time. For our farewell to Holland, the weather turned fair once again. The crossing from Dordrecht to Veere was splendid, and we again saw schools of seals in the North Sea. We took a rapid trip to Veere, formerly a majestic town, today a village with opulent remains. Middleburg concludes this series of Dutch towns, which are so curious. It is one of the most typical, with a sumptuous town hall and, above all, an unforgettable abbey. I don’t need to tell you how happy I will be to see you when I arrive. Write back immediately to Le Havre and let me know where you are. I’ll send you a telegram just as soon as I arrive. See you soon, my dear friend. Kind regards, Maurice Ravel\n\nCorrespondence\n\n: : : 73\n\n22. to Ida Godebska! August 9, 1905\n\nMy dear friend, I found your card upon returning to Paris for the second time. In fact, as soon as I returned, I left again in order to spend several days in Marysur-Marne.” For a change, this visit was devoted to numerous outings in canoes, rowboats, sailboats, and sculls. Oh, the nostalgia for water! ’'m now back on land, alas!, and almost all alone. All of our friends, except for the Benedictuses, are on vacation. The Edwardses are in Trouville, and I’ve seen them only once since my return. I’m really bored! So, I got back to the grind. Moreover, I'll have to move at top speed, as I will be going to Brittany for the third time next month. The mission? Oh yes! it still torments me. I’ll try to expose my “state of mind” to you without rambling too much. You recall what I said following the memorable and ridiculous scene with the telegram: a moment like this, so profound, so perfect, would almost suffice for me, and would console me by itself, even if nothing were to come of it. Well, it wasn’t as Platonic as it seemed. I thought of the many separations—from family, friends, perhaps, who knows? definitive. So, Iwas tempted to rejoice when Calvocoressi informed me of the Minister’s intentions concerning me, if I may venture to put it that way. The plan was as follows: the first opportunity would be taken to entrust me with the pretense of a mission, which would allow me to remain in Paris, or at least not too far away. Through that simple pretext, I would be put on the payroll. Thereupon, I went to see Gaveau, who, as you know, had urged me to come back from Amsterdam to see him. At that point, I learned that the abovementioned Gaveau, an attaché in the Ministry of Fine Arts, was the one who had this brilliant idea, and had communicated it to the Minister. Needless to say, when I found that out, I couldn’t resist telling him of my desire to go to the Orient, which he took note of. Naturally, on the way home, I began to regret having spoken so thoughtlessly. But everything seems to be ganging up against me. Last night, I visited Madame Benedictus, whose brother was recently appointed a counselor to the court of appeals of . . Pondicherry!! That set off ecstatic epistolary impressions: an exotic atmosphere, motley crowds, palaces, elephants, monkeys, gazelles, Ceylon, Jakarta, darn it! The effect was soon felt: this morning Iemerged from the train station in Constantinople, on to a terrace overlooking the Bosporus, and as I was leaning over to gaze upon a marvelous site, Iwas awakened. I uttered some inhuman grunts, and wanted to go back to sleep, but that proved impossible. Well, that’s where things stand.’ What I\n\n74:\n\n: : Correspondence\n\nwould like is a formal order enjoining me to leave right now. Long live autocracy! There, 8 pages in which I have bored you with my tergiversations. Don’t be angry with me. Being so talkative makes the distance between us seem shorter. I’m beginning to be sentimental, and that won’t do at all. It’s time to stop. Tell Jean that I’m preparing some extraordinary folded paper hens for him, and kiss the delicate fingers of my fiancée.* Affectionate regards to Cipa, and, dear friend, believe in the sincere friendship of yours truly, Maurice Ravel 1. In June 1904 Ravel was introduced to Xavier Cyprien (Cipa) Godebski (1864— 1937) and his wife Ida (1872-1935), who soon became two of the composer’s closest friends (see plate 5). A frequent guest at their modest Paris apartment on rue St. Florentin, and later on rue d’Athénes, Ravel also enjoyed staying at their country home “Ta Grangette” (The Little Barn) at Valvins, near Fontainebleau. Here, he composed Ma Mere I’Oye for the Godebski children Mimie and Jean. The Sonatine was dedicated to Ida and Cipa Godebski, and “Le Cygne” from the Histoires naturelles as well as La Valse were dedicated to Cipa’s half sister Misia. Married three times, her salons continually attracted the most talked-about personalities of the day. Her first husband was Thadée Natanson, cofounder of La Revue blanche; her second husband was Alfred Edwards, the wealthy and influential publisher of Le Matin; finally, she married the Spanish painter José Maria Sert. Some 250 letters to various members of the Godebski\n\nfamily have been preserved. 2. The Delages had a summer home there. 3. Ravel’s mission never did materialize. 4. A gentle reference to Jean’s sister Mimie, then five years old. On occasion, Ravel was their baby-sitter.\n\n23. to Madame René de Saint-Marceaux Hotel de la Plage Morgat!\n\nAugust 23, 1905\n\nDear Madame,\n\nYour kind letter arrived with some delay. I had already left Ostend when it arrived there. A change of itinerary was the reason it remained at the general delivery in Trouville. It was then sent to Paris, and finally to Morgat, where I have been for some time already, in this splendid region which almost makes me forget the marvelous trip that I took over a period of two months. I see from your questions that the letter I wrote to you from Dordrecht shared the fate of many others. In it, I told you about the beginning of a magnificent voyage through Belgium, Holland, and the banks of the Rhine up to Frankfurt, through rivers, canals, and seas, in the yacht of my friends the Edwardses. I saw unforgettable things in this marvelous situation. During all of\n\nCorrespondence\n\n: : : 75\n\nthis time, I didn’t compose two measures, but I was storing up a host of impressions, and I expect this winter to be extraordinarily productive. I have never been so happy to be alive, and I firmly believe that joy is far more fertile than suffering. It’s an opinion as valid as any other. We’ll see this winter if I was mistaken. While awaiting the pleasure of bringing you the fruit of these considerable labors, I would be very happy to hear from you. Please remember me to M. de Saint-Marceaux, and, dear Madame, believe in the respectful friendship of yours truly, Maurice Ravel 1. A seaside resort in Brittany (see plate 7).\n\n24. to Madame Jean Cruppi' H6tel des Bains de Mer August 27, 1905 Roscoff? Dear Madame, It has been a long time since I’ve given you any sign of life—since Dordrecht, I believe, where I replied to your kind letter with a few ecstatic words. It was, however, only the beginning of this unforgettable voyage. I had only begun my visit to Holland, that charming, childlike, and somewhat baroque country. I knew absolutely nothing about the banks of the Rhine, which are so diverse, with their wooded hills, their old-fashioned castles,’ their gigantic and magnificent factories. I don’t have to tell you that I didn’t attempt to compose anything during this time, but I was storing up so much! I have a host of projects, more or less grandiose, with which to occupy my winter. I spent only a few days in Paris, during which I finished the Sonatine, and finally began the symphony which I have been thinking about for two years.* Then, in order to rest from this labor, I set out again for Brittany, which I will explore until midSeptember. It is delightful to come back to unusual regions, pleasurably revisiting those districts which are so varied, with desolate landscapes of such subtle coloration, dramatic boulders, and, above all, the sea! For the first time in my life, Idon’t want to return to Paris, that city of snares,\n\nhate, and slander, all of which await you when you have been away for several months. Yet, I have lived in this deceitful atmosphere for a long time, and I am still naive enough to be disillusioned about friends and even about indifferent acquaintances. Please forgive me for pestering you with my idiotic mood. It comes over me sometimes—fortunately it doesn’t last very long. The weather is turning fair again, and I’m going to go boating. I don’t have to tell you how happy I would be to hear from you. Please send my kind regards to Monsieur Cruppi, your\n\n76 : : : Correspondence\n\ndaughter, and your young friends. Dear Madame, believe in the respectful friendship of yours truly, Maurice Ravel If you would be kind enough to write, address your letter to 11 rue Chevallier, Levallois Perret, and it will be forwarded. 1. Ravel dedicated Noél des jouets and L’Heure espagnole to Mme Jean Cruppi, whose husband would become an influential minister in the French government. Her personal intervention was largely responsible for securing the first performance of L’Heure espagnole (see letter no. 46, note 7). 2. This seaside resort in Brittany is near Morgat. 3. Ravel used the German word “Schloss,” which means a castle. 4. Ravel’s comments about this little known symphony are found on p. 497.\n\n25. to Ida Godebska Thingvellir September 2, 1905 Iceland For heaven’s sake, yes! I took a short trip to Iceland. But I will soon be returning to Brittany, from where I'll write again. Kind regards, Maurice Ravel\n\n26. Hubert Pernot' to Michel Dimitri Calvocoressi’ Fontenay-sous-Bois (Seine) 7 rue de Clos d’Orléans\n\nDecember 28, 1905\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhile looking over the program of your lecture, I almost regretted having moved; I personally hope that you will give it again, as it has been a very long time since I have heard Greek folk melodies—I almost should say pure Greek folk melodies—even though I still spend a good part of my time with the dialects of Chios. I am pleased that you find certain parts of my collection worthy of being harmonized, and I am very happy to grant you the authorization that you desire. If you wish to publish them for voice and piano, don’t you think (in case you include the Greek words) that it would be a good idea for us to talk a bit about it? Idon’t wish to interfere with your publication, but I might be able to give you some useful information, either by explaining the words in my collection more precisely, or by pointing out more suitable words which might be adapted\n\nCorrespondence\n\n: : : 77\n\nequally well. But you will decide for yourself. If by chance you need me, I am at your disposition. Although Fontenay is outside the fortifications of Paris, it can be reached easily and quickly, and is only 15 minutes from the Bastille train station. Just drop me a note to be sure to find me at home. Very cordially yours, H. Pernot Please give my best regards to Skiadoressi. 1. Pernot spent the summers of 1898 and 1899 collecting folk melodies on the island of Chios, off the western coast of Asia Minor. Three of Ravel’s Five Greek Folk Songs were taken from his collection. The entire song cycle was first performed by soprano Marguerite Babaian at a lecture-recital presented by Calvocoressi during the 1905-06 season. (See Hubert Pernot, Mélodies populaires grecques de I’ile de Chio, Paris: Imprimerie Nationale, 1903. Pernot recorded the folk melodies, which were later transcribed by Paul Le Flem.) 2. Ravel and Calvocoressi (1877-1944) met in 1898 and became lifelong friends. A gifted critic and translator, Calvocoressi wrote articles and books in English and French; his fluent knowledge of Greek led to the creation of the Five Greek Folk Songs, and his expertise in Russian assisted Ravel in dealing with the Ballet Russe. His book of recollections, Musicians Gallery, contains much important insight into Ravel’s career.\n\n27. to Déodat de Séverac’ L’Ermitage January 31, 1906 [Draveil (S. & O.)]? My dear Séverac, I thought I would see you yesterday at the Cruppis, and tell you of my keen regret at not being able to go to the home of Mme de Saint-Marceaux. I didn’t know that Le Coeur du moulin would be performed there, but I console myself in thinking that I will hear it in a better situation, that is, on stage.* I would also have wanted to excuse myself for plagiarizing you (as Lalo would say). But that’s really not my fault. Besides, how could I have suspected that there would be such a close relationship between a boat on the ocean and a festive southern country house?!!* I trust that you won’t be too angry with me. Till next Saturday, an affectionate handshake. Maurice Ravel 1. Although Déodat de Séverac (1873-1921) studied in Paris at the Schola Cantorum, most of his life was spent in southern France, his birthplace. His music frequently reflects his native region, and has been called “Mediterranean.” 2. A suburb south of Paris. (S. & O. refers to the Seine and Oise rivers.)\n\n78 : : : Correspondence 3. Séverac’s opera in two acts, Le Coeur du moulin (The Heart of the Mill), with libretto by Maurice Magre, was introduced at the Opéra-Comique on December 8, 1909. 4. Ravel was playfully exaggerating. Writing in Le Temps on January 30, 1906, Pierre Lalo observed that two pieces from the Miroirs, “Une Barque sur l’océan” and “La Vallée des cloches,” exhibited in a “completely different manner, a very distant and transposed echo of the feeling which inspires En Languedoc, M. de Séverac’s most important work.” The piano suites Miroirs and En Languedoc each contain five pieces. Composed about one year apart, they were introduced by Ricardo Vifies. Despite their many differences, “Une Barque sur l’océan” and “Vers "
