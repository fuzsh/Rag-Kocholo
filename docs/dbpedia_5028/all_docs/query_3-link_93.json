After having desperately, for hours on end, with their eyes closed, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the preceding minute has been weighed down by a line of reasoning in strict contradiction to the laws of logic and the reality of the present, this brief “absence” signifying that the door is now open through which they may perhaps presently be able to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote from it, which will mean their having a more or less “good” night. marcel proust2\n\n∵ It was not an occasion for sleep. I was driving from central South Carolina ­toward Charleston and had accelerated to the excessive velocity that has become the de facto limit on Interstate 26, an east–west artery stretching from the Appalachians to the Atlantic. It was an entropic afternoon in late November or early December, the genre of dull chilly day that qualifies for winter in few locales other than almost flat and nearly winterless eastern South Carolina. Shortly before, I had exited a typically raucous composition class and now was driving to a retinal examination that, requested on short notice because\n\n1 The Complete Works of Shakespeare, ed.

Turning on the radio with much in mind, I happened to tune in to the l­ ocal npr affiliate, just in time to hear a scholarly-sounding rendition of some exquisite verses: I woke in the night to see your diminished bulk lying beside me– you on your back, like a sarcophagus as your feet held up the covers … . (ll. 16–19)3 As the program continued and then closed, it became clear that the reader to whom I had listened was the poet Donald Hall, who alternately was interviewed and was reading selections from the poetry of his late wife, Jane Kenyon. Not having caught the title of the poem from which such intriguing lines had been drawn, I later spent a busy hour or so browsing through Kenyon’s work before I located the full text of “Pharaoh” (1993), a brilliant and ­confessional-sounding piece depicting a woman’s difficult experiences during her companion’s recuperation after surgery. Strange yet also typical that this brief masterpiece of sleep-poetry was previously unknown to me. Nor was I then at all familiar with Kenyon – even though I had at that point already researched the topic of sleep for a decade or more with abundant accumulations of source material. (And during her tragically curtailed career, Kenyon engaged the topic of sleep with stellar results on several occasions.) Reflecting on this poem and the incident that introduced me to it, I have come to perceive the whole episode as nearly emblematic of the placement and experience of sleep in postmodern culture (or in contemporary culture if one shies away from that so frequently invoked term, the postmodern, the “p” word). Ubiquitous as well as elusive, sleep may not be attainable when longed for, may be excluded by crowded agendas or impinged upon by insomnia, or can be heavily tinged with such unfavorable insinuations as those of illness, anaesthesia, mortality, or neglect of duty. This is not to deny that the entire gamut of sleep-experiences (e.g., dreams included) has been imbued with these and similar associations during other eras. Yet there seems to be a heightening, an accentuation of such aspects – at least in the realms of visual 3 Jane Kenyon, “Pharaoh,” Collected Poems (St. Paul: Graywolf, 2005), 265.

Germane here also is the factor of narrative resistance, a nearly inseparable accompaniment of sleep yet, again, often particularly detectable during the postmodern era. This phenomenon is discussed in detail below. But for now, it may suffice to point out that unmistakably resonant in these verses from “­Pharaoh” is the insinuation that this sleeper’s dormancy retards and ­thickens – and could well entail an indefinite postponement of – awakening. It is also relevant to call attention to the poem’s seemingly innocuous opening line, a quotation culled from the so often apt solipsisms of Yogi Berra: “The future ain’t what it used to be,” said the sage of the New York Yankees … . (ll. 1–2) As a naive paradox, the assertion amuses and is non-threatening. But in a complex literary context such as “Pharaoh,” there may be something to worry about. If the future has deteriorated, the past may have done so as well, and likewise for the present. And with no past, present, or future, there is little likelihood that any sort of narrative can develop. Hence this carefree opening ties in with the ominous scenario depicted in the final lines. Kenyon’s already lowkeyed narrative is stymied, is sluggish, yet without depicting a state of easeful repose at the same time. How different from the anxious watching of Kenyon’s speaker and her ­sleeper’s leaden quiescence is the implied wholesomeness of sleep in the ­otherwise atrocious situation that unfolds in the closing moments of Richard Connell’s intense short story, “The Most Dangerous Game” (1924). A noted hunter, traversing the Caribbean on a ship, falls off and then swims to a nearly deserted island. Barely escaping a briny grave, he reclines at the edge of a ­jungle and tumbles “headlong into the deepest sleep of his life.”4 The worst is to come, however, for the island is controlled by a demented Russian general, Zaroff. The latter insists that, as in the case of all previous individuals stranded on the island, Rainsford must submit to being hunted for a three-day period (or being murdered by the general’s enormous henchman). At the conclusion of this interval, if the hunted one has not been slain, the survivor will have won the contest. It seems a foregone conclusion that Rainsford will succumb as well, yet he somehow evades the various ruses and snares 4 Richard Connell, “The Most Dangerous Game,” 101 Years’ Entertainment: the Great Detective Stories 1841–1941, ed. Ellery Queen (New York: Modern Library, 1946), 819.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nthat have customarily enabled Zaroff to finish off his victims. In the end, it is Rainsford who triumphs and, having killed his tormenters, he slumbers deliciously – after three nearly sleepless days – in the luxurious bed that Zaroff has unwillingly left at his disposal. “The Most Dangerous Game” is emphatically modernist in its portrayal of sleep though clearly without the subtlety of, say, Proust or the provocations of (for instance) Baudelaire or Mann (whose relevant works are examined in the discussions that follow). Yet for Connell as for so many modernist verbal and visual artists, there are appropriate intervals and locales for restorative repose as determined by events, well-ordered time-schemes, and natural or architectural settings. Sleep under the wrong circumstances can indeed be dangerous or even lethal, but in this absorbing tale, sleep is relatively unproblematic and unambiguous throughout. Thus Connell and his protagonist manage to stave off and manipulate its resistances so that this steadily unfolding narrative can prance masterfully to its close. Whatever else this study undertakes to demonstrate and clarify, it begins with the observation that the representation of sleep, even in its elemental dreamless form, performs aesthetic functions, delineates the individual psyche, and reveals cultural values. Such representations, in addition, often indicate a discursive ground via the linear posture of a reclining figure or figures. For modernism, sleep indeed tends to establish an existential baseline, a lower threshold of lived human experience. With the ambience of fragmentation often apparent during the postmodern era, however, the dorsal line harboring the central nervous system is frequently restive as depicted individuals imply desire for–rather than acquisition of – equilibrium in dormancy. While dreams, sleeping nudes, and other facets of dormancy were very popular among modernist writers and visual artists, sleep-phenomena of every type have given rise to an even greater abundance and range of postmodern artwork. Indeed, there are grounds for detecting a postmodern quasi-genre, the hypnoglyph, that exploits the many enigmatic and evocative qualities of dormancy. Quite diverse in its manifestations, this representational type is widespread in contemporary verbal and visual culture. A starting point for this project is found in the existence of shared views, across time-periods and cultures, regarding the characteristics and the value (or lack thereof) of a fundamental human experience. The argument is also made that likenesses and trends in the representation of sleep are tied to recurring cultural and ideological factors as well as to cognitive processes held to be universal. With a vast range of material and approaches available, a degree of proportion is sought via an Aristotelian perspective. In his treatise on the subject, “On Sleep and Waking” (a segment of the Parva naturalia), Aristotle\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\ndefines sleep as a state experienced by all intelligent life and characterized by inactivity of the senses as well as by potential for awakening. And in contrast to later commentators who emphasize dreaming as the only significant stage of dormancy, Aristotle has presented sleep (through contrasted throughout with the waking state) as a distinct corporeal experience in its own right (453b–458a:33).5 Following the Aristotelian avenue further and adapting the notion of plot (muthos) set forth in the Poetics, this project argues for a four-phase sequence involved, in a variety of ways, in visual art and literature. To be sure, the sleepwaking cycle here at issue invokes a coherence at variance with the traditional notion of plot as a synthesis of all that is done or a “construction of events” (“synthesin ton pragmaton” [Poetics 1450a:3–4]).6 The overarching theater that encloses both sleep and the waking state is physiological as well as cognitive. Intentions, agency, and performative capacities are often mediated and, above all, in flux within an inclusive, corporeal matrix. In addition, the circadian cycle, if apprehended as a plot-like sequence, is hardly an imitation or representation (mimesis) although it has given rise to an immense representational outgrowth – and continues to do so. Despite the discrepancies between Aristotelian muthos and the circadian cycle, something resembling peripeteia is surely often found in the latter. And there are experiences resembling anagnorisis as well, at awakening if not at other times. Christopher Dewdney has eloquently commented that “it is always night inside the body. Bright sunlight passes through the skin and on into deeper tissues to a depth of approximately three centimeters, but past that it is pitch dark.”7 Yet it can also be argued that somehow within, amid synapses, neurons, enzymes, and the mechanisms of memory, there is twilight as well, in addition to nightfall, dawn, even arrant daylight. In the context of this discussion, it may be best to conceive of the circadian or sleep-waking cycle as beginning with an initiatory phase that often entails an appreciation of sleep’s qualities or a succession of images that mimics a process of artistic creation. The second stage, sleep itself, can provide narrative transition, an opportunity for depiction – or surveillance – of the sleeper, or an occasion for intervention 5 Aristotle devotes a section as well to the study of dreams (458a:34–462b:12).

Third is dream, and, if it occurs, it may reveal the life trajectory or other basic traits of a sleeper; dream can also fashion a layer of narrative that interacts with the main narrative of a text. The final phase, awakening, often presents a new world characterized by immediate contact with an individual’s destiny or inner nature.8 In its most evolved form, awakening is depicted as a resurrection or final judgment. In conjunction with this framework that, broadly speaking, is narratival, it should also be pointed out that – very often and for a very long period of time–, the sleep segment of the cycle has been apprehended as a form of resistance to narrative. Building on a hypnophobic trend in Greek culture that dates from the Iliad, Plato forges a strong case against slumber in Book 7 of the Laws, where sleep’s incompatibility with the constructive activities of the polis is brought to the fore. While such reservations have alternated with a longing for and, indeed, a love of sleep in many social and historical contexts, negative views have tended to predominate. Also, between Plato and the present day, a theological dimension is often implicated in these denigrating assessments. Way-stations in this regard can be located in René Descartes’s concept of a vigilant cogito and in a widely read pair of works entitled Christian Directory, one by Robert Persons (1582, 1622) and the other by Richard Baxter (1678), wherein sleep is sharply censured. These discursive sites are among those that have contributed substantially to a “cognitive ethic” that is, along with the work ethic, much a part of Euro-American culture. I should also make clear that this book is not exclusively a foray into the interpretation of dreams in the arts. The approach here is somno- and somatocentric as well. Dreams are of course grounded in the body, but scholarly discussions have tended to examine oneiric experiences from the standpoints of symbolism and of narrative. Dreams are analyzed in the present study to insure that the commentary deals adequately with the facets of sleep that each work brings into play. For the most part, however, attention is slanted toward what the presence – or absence – of dreams may imply about the overall sleep situation conveyed in a given work of visual art or literature. Sleep experiences may facilitate hermeneutic narratives in instances when, in addition to the content of a certain dream, the posture of the dreamer and related details may be primary contributors to whatever resistances are communicated by an artwork. There is debate as to whether postmodernism has concluded, but in any case, the new sleep-centered work embraces such postmodern goals as endeavoring 8 For overviews of circadianism that are informative and even entertaining as well, see ­Dewdney, 136–41, and J. Allan Hobson, The Dreaming Brain (New York: Basic Books, 1988), 109–33.\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nto portray what is unpresentable and problematizing prior genres. Accepted literary forms (especially allegory or the diary), if detected in these ambiguous works, are likely to appear residual. The hypnoglyph is, moreover, often characterized by a general flattening traceable to visual techniques of the ­nineteenth-century. But probably the most significant trait is the foregrounding of narrative resistance, usually in tandem with a frustrated diaristic ­impulse. The diary with its recording of circadian transactions is the main prior genre that the hypnoglyph complicates. Scanning the Hypnoglyph examines in detail the modernist paradigm, within which sleep-states, typically, are serenely aestheticized. The work identifies and interprets, also, key monuments in a chronicle of a postmodern representational “kind.” Interrogating paintings as well as poetry and other texts from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and onward to the turn of a millennium, Scanning the Hypnoglyph assembles a wide-ranging exhibition-withoutwalls. Along the way, ideological and aesthetic contexts are sought out for a varied group of restive sleepers as the artworks that house them are scrutinized and critiqued. In the substantial first chapter, “From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph,” I ­address theoretical concerns and provide historical background. Among other ­issues, the involvement of the diaristic model is charted in relation to H ­ eidegger’s concept of an idealized “everydayness” that “is not to be understood calendrically.”9 In the arts, key passages in Proust are found to reveal a similar perspective. Proust is especially relevant because of his frequent employment of sleep-states in constructing a privileged temporality. However, with the passage into late modernism and beyond, Heidegger’s remarks (with Proust as literary counterpart) are found to indicate an edifying moment i­mpossible to maintain. As the hypnoglyph begins to emerge, the calendrical dimension (held by Heidegger to be of minor importance) is rather salient. But soon this ancillary temporal mode becomes difficult to detect. Thus the second chapter begins with observation that, when modernism wanes, the diary manages on many literary occasions to alleviate some of the era’s perceived defects, such as over-optimism regarding the possibilities of individual subjectivity. For poet ­Elizabeth Bishop, the diary as implied pre-text helps reconfigure the self by calling forth a basic, circadian paradigm. Even when the usual alternation of activity and rest is disrupted – as in her somewhat bizarre “Sleeping Standing Up”–, diaristic overtones point in the direction of a stabilizing “log” of 9 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time (Sein und Zeit), trans. John Macquarrie and Edward ­Robinson (London: scm Press, 1962), 422.\n\nxvi\n\nPreface\n\nimmediate sensations. For further focus on the factor of temporal compromise discovered in Bishop, discussion turns to Robert Lowell’s “Man and Wife,” a confessional text in which time is seemingly transcendent. But while Lowell indeed evokes an idealized or Heideggerian everydayness, his poem also leaves ample room for slippage that frustrates the emergence of an adequate or authentic present. As the chapter continues, the discussion assesses the phenomenon of v­ ertical slumber as a seeming representational aberration that becomes nearly emblematic, during the postmodern era, of the hypnoglyph’s tendency to encapsulate a fascination with sleep together with an implicit awareness of the resistances that the condition of human dormancy entails. Two substantial paintings by contemporary New York artist Vincent Desiderio are examined as characteristic visual texts. Chapter 3 of this study of the hypnoglyph looks further at sleeping postures and at what the material and other contexts of sleep may reveal about the individual who slumbers (or wishes to do so). Assessed here are correlations between – on the one hand – the details of varied representations and–on the other–what is implied in each case regarding the size of the dormant ego. The centerpiece of the chapter is Richard Wilbur’s “Walking to Sleep” (1969), an impressive poem that ostensibly offers remedies for insomnia resulting from conflict between the body’s claim for deep repose on the one hand and pressing agendas on the other. Two alternative “therapies” are set forth, both requiring the prospective sleeper – in lieu of simply counting sheep – to engage in image-forming processes that resemble aesthetic programs. The first major section of the poem advances a cure for insomnia that fails because the mode of image-formation recommended to the would-be sleeper is controlled and ratiocinative. Scrutiny of this ill-conceived “treatment” reveals a number of parallels with postmodernism, which was unfolding during this time-period. The second therapy, on the other hand, culminates in the dormant figure of the Hindu god, Vishnu, who contentedly dreams in a cosmic setting. Wilbur’s interjection of this exotic image is ingeniously apt as “Walking to Sleep” closes. For the apparition of Vishnu tends to revitalize a decaying modernist poetics in which sleep is valuable as a purveyor of dreams. Wilbur’s artistically recuperative innovation is striking, with both sleep and a global cartography constrained to serve a modernist poetics. He was not, however, a pioneer in attempting such an inclusive construct. More than thirty years previously, in an extraordinary essay, “Sleep, Sweet Sleep” (“Süßer Schlaf”), the master modernist Thomas Mann conjured up a similar confederation of apparently incompatible elements. Mann is on this occasion not involved in a polemics within the arts, or at least less clearly subscribed to one than is the case for Wilbur. Mann’s interest is exploring the capacities of sleep,\n\nPreface\n\nxvii\n\nwhich is for Mann both a mysterious and rejuvenating physiological process. In “Sleep, Sweet Sleep” Mann also reveals links between sleep and artistic capacities. Filling out this chapter, there are assessments of significant visual works by two mixed-media artists – one German (Anselm Kiefer) and the other American (Fran Gardner) – and by an American painter, David Yaghjian. Chapter 4, entitled “Latter-Day Ariadnes: From Hypnoglyph to Somnoscript,” is centered on Marguerite Duras’s The Malady of Death (La maladie de la mort). A mere fifty-odd pages of large print, The Malady of Death manages to blur distinctions between poetry and prose, book and pamphlet, novella and tale, fantasy and reality, pornography and “high” art. Beyond the typical resistance to narrative, there is an ambience of resistance to representation as well. Duras splices the imprecisions of sleep into her textual program with mischievous deftness. The focal point for the varied concerns of this ambivalently narrational document is the recurrent image of a sleeping female nude. The author exploits this historically well-endowed image within a critique of the conventions of gender domination. The Malady of Death tells of a sexual encounter of several days between a nameless young man of ambiguous sexuality, who is referred to only as “vous,” and an anonymous woman who has allowed herself to be hired. The two individuals remain pronouns without antecedent, characters desirous of self-authorship. Whether the relationship even transpires as fictional actuality is never totally clear. Also examined in this chapter is Duras’s adept incorporation of a pre-text originating in a non-European narrative tradition. At issue is the “House of the Sleeping Beauties” by Japanese writer Yasunari Kawabata, a work with its own sense of the impasses inherent in a dialectic of desire. So subtly effected is the intertextual absorption of this Japanese text that the term “somnoscript” is an appropriate designation for the resultant text. At the same time, it is reasonable to propose that a similar, subdued borrowing has contributed to ­Kawabata’s narrative. His comely women, confined to slumber for a contracted period of time, can be assumed to have their source in European folklore. “House of the Sleeping Beauties” takes place in an unusual bordello, a haven for old men where intercourse is prohibited. Here senescent clientele (who are presumably past the age of virility) pay for the privilege of passing the night in the company of a young and beautiful nude woman who has been submerged for the occasion in a drug-induced slumber. Striking similarities of “action” and of splintered, refracted libido establish an intertextual link between the decayed psychic landscapes of Kawabata and those of Duras. Chapter 5 is a necessarily lengthy one that treats of the abundant modernist and postmodern representations of sleep in gay, lesbian, and androgynous\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\ncontexts. Discussion begins with Courbet’s arresting Sleep (The Two Friends); this provocative rendition of a somnolent nude female (and presumably lesbian) couple is a landmark in the representation of gender. An inquiry into the nexus of sleep and homoeroticism – so intriguingly depicted by C ­ ourbet – leads to consideration of a motif of late-classical sculpture, the sleeping hermaphrodite. Lost in general oblivion after the collapse of ancient Rome, the sleeping hermaphrodite as artistic – and cultural – dynamism underwent a virtual resurrection during the mid-1400s when an example of this type of statuary was unearthed in Rome. From the rear, the statue ostensibly represents a nude female figure that is reclining in calm repose on the right side, but tilted toward the abdomen. Frontal inspection reveals an unlikely combination – and confrontation – of male genitalia and enticingly conical female breasts. With the rediscovery of classical statuary during the mid-fifteenth century, the term “hermaphrodite” in its various forms becomes a signifier of erotic attraction and behavior involving individuals of the same gender. At the same time, the variant eroticism now tied to this figure in her/his dormant condition establishes a secondary or “satellite” connection with the condition of sleep. Hence from the mid-1400s onward, representational sites are evident in which homoeroticism and somnolence co-exist. With Courbet’s Sleep established as a connector to an Early Modern representational trend tying together sleep and the homoerotic, focus turns to a series of verbal and visual texts of the twentieth century in which this linkage is significant. As varied examples are considered, it turns out that there is no ­single pattern of rebellious or odd “queerness” that authors and visual artists have pursued. Included in this examination of alternative pathways – through sleep – to the erotic are some problematic attempts at androgyny, representational efforts to coordinate and blend gender-based determinations and alterities. Scanning the Hypnoglyph closes with an overview of the status of sleep at a millennial divide. A broad cultural dynamics is implicated, a perilous junction of work and leisure, agendas and repose. What persists is the observation that sleep, more often than not, is fraught with negative associations, whatever the context. Yet the cultural status of dormancy has also risen during the postmodern era, due in part to advances in sleep research. This reassessment has helped launch a new cult of dreams. Empirical studies, also, have documented the ill-effects of insomnia and have resulted in more lenient protocols regarding indulgence in sleep. urls for internet pages are valid as of the time of final editing (August 2016). And a general comment on the translations: Those of literary texts and critical commentaries in languages other than English of course have varied origins.\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\nA number are my own. In every case, my intent has been to provide an Englishing that captures the basic significations of the source text. The nuances and ­elegance of the results at times may be subject to question. With regard to works of art known by more than one title – and where more than one ­language may be involved –, I have tended to use only the most widely circulated English title. The works by Anselm Kiefer are an exception since the artist, in the pieces discussed in this study, has inscribed each with a title.\n\nAcknowledgements About midway through Rabelais’s extended comic novel, one of the world’s key picaresque characters – Panurge – exclaims with his usual hyperbole that mankind was created solely for the sake of generating debts. That this statement may contain some truth is reflected in the fact that this project is indebted for its completion to numerous individuals, funding agencies, and institutions. To select one or even a few as preeminent out of many is a challenge, but I should probably begin with mention of the late Phyllis Bober of Bryn Mawr College and her encouragement of this undertaking when it was in its early stages. The period was the early 1990s; the setting was a Summer Seminar (of which Professor Bober was one of the directors) sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and held at the American Academy at Rome. It was a time when I was persuaded that the discourse of sleep in visual art in literature, as I then referred to my topic, could be adequately dealt with in a single volume. That view changed as the project advanced and as the manuscript grew substantially during a year-long fellowship funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and later during a half-year residency fellowship at the Camargo Foundation in Cassis, France. (A companion volume on the representational role of sleep in Early Modern Europe awaits completion.) Michael Pretina, then-Director of the Camargo, deserves a special acknowledgment for his mentoring of my project and for his able management. Final writing was carried out at the University of Bergen in Norway during the course of a Fulbright lectureship while I was also pursuing another research agenda. I am very grateful to Aleida Assmann for having invited me to teach a prosem­inar on the literature of sleep and dreams at the University of Konstanz. ­Miriam Frendo, Bettina Hahn, and other students made this experience a particularly worthwhile one as I sifted through major texts and sought engagement with the theoretical problems that my topic raised. Valuable, too, was an opportunity to present my findings at a joint Konstanz-Hebrew University of Jerusalem conference in Israel. I was also a participant in the Konstanz English ­Section’s ongoing lecture series. Christopher Norris kindly invited me to give two ­lectures on the modern and postmodern dimensions of sleep at the University of Cardiff. Chris’s comments as well as those offered by other attendees were insightful and helpful. Similarly useful lecture opportunities materialized at the University of Antwerp and the University of South Carolina. At the University of Bergen, Erik Tonning was supportive of the project and had me give a lecture as part of his Modernism and Christianity Lecture Series. The\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxxi\n\nlibrary resources at Bergen were distinctly useful as revisions neared conclusion. I also wish to thank Dr. Christa Stevens and Gert Jager, Editors at Rodopi/ Brill, who took an interest in the manuscript and have been attentive to its progress toward publication. Professor Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, Editor of the Series Consciousness, Literature and the Arts, has been similarly helpful in ensuring that the results of the project are optimal. I am quite grateful to him for providing his own translation of a small but difficult and crucial passage from Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde. And certainly, I am thankful that an anonymous outside reader at Rodopi/Brill responded favorably to my work. At South Carolina State University, three successive Chairs – Don Powell, Calvin Hutson, and Ghussan Greene – assisted with lightening my teaching load at key points. And certainly, all of my colleagues in the English Department of scsu deserve my gratitude for having shouldered additional instruction at those times. Administrators Barbara Hatton, Leroy Davis, James Arrington, John Simpson, Learie Luke, Joyce Blackwell, and George Cooper provided encouragement and helped with academic leaves and travel ­money. Enda Wade, inter-library loan specialist extraordinaire, strove indefatigably to fill each of my requests for source materials, no matter how obscure. Westinghouse/scsu Faculty Development grants over two successive summers enabled me to move the project forward when much of the basic work was still underway. Also valuable were grants provided by Beth Thomas and the Orangeburg (South Carolina) Arts Council that supplemented the travel money awarded by my university. Among colleagues at scsu, Stan Harrold gave invaluable advice early on with regard to structuring the inquiry and ­organizing my earliest findings. Frank Martin was helpful in commenting on the visual sector of the project; Al Fleming was unflagging in his interest and support. Photographer Susan J. Smith helped with images. Heather Hahn of Columbia College assisted with my readings of texts in German. Very deserving of mention are some of the many colleagues at other institutions who were met at conferences and elsewhere and who expressed – in a ­generally favorable way – curiosity about this rather non-conforming undertaking and who offered insights. Larry Rhu of the University of South Carolina called my attention to Richard Wilbur’s “Walking to Sleep.” Janet and Steven Walker of Rutgers University have long offered their support. I am s­ imilarly grateful to Dudley Marchi (North Carolina State University), Daniel Russell (Pittsburgh), Wendy Faris (ut-Arlington), Endi Poskovic (Whittier) – whom I met at the Camargo –, and Wenying Xu (Jacksonville U), a long-ago seniorthesis advisee turned advisor. To be mentioned as well – and perhaps of greatest import – are the contemporary artists who consented to interviewing and hence advanced invaluable\n\nxxii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\ninsights with regard to just what is signified when there are representations of sleep. It was thus of much benefit for this project that I was able to meet and briefly interview the poet Richard Wilbur at a reception sponsored by the South Atlantic Modern Language Association (samla) on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday. Among the visual artists, my communication and friendship with the painter Vincent Desiderio has been inestimable. Beyond the considerable space devoted to this artist’s work in this volume, something of Vincent’s comments on the significations of sleep are reflected on nearly every page. Other relevant discussions have transpired between the author and painters David Nevins and David Yaghjian, ceramicists Jeri Burdick and Sara Legvoldt, fiber-artists Fran Gardner and Jon Eric Riis, and especially Janet Kozachek, painter, mosaicist, and this writer’s conjugal sleeping partner. In addition to the lectures already mentioned, portions of this book were presented as conference papers at the annual meetings of the American Comparative Literature Association (acla), the Modern Language Association (mla), and samla. Parts of the second chapter appeared in my article, “Vertical Slumber, the Hypnoglyph, and the Outs and Ins of the Postmodern” in Comparative Literature 53.3 (Summer 2001): 233–61. Though then published at the University of Oregon, the journal is currently a Duke University Press publication. Comparative Literature as well as the Marlborough Gallery in New York were generous in their subvention of the color illustrations accompanying the article.\n\nList of Figures 1 Oskar Kokoschka, The Tempest (1913).

Caligula and Andy Warhol are among the exceptions. Caligula was a notorious insomniac who slept for about three hours nightly and would wander through spacious porticos invoking the day.4 As an artist, Warhol was fascinated with the muted consciousness evident during sleep, yet he also desired to reduce his own dormancy to a bare minimum and took amphetamines to lengthen his workday.5 Such exceptions to the general acceptance of sleep constitute rather extreme examples, but at the same time, unequivocal eulogies of the dormant state are also infrequent. Until rather recently, of all the universal elements of human life – such as death, love, violence, or sex –, sleep as a spacious discursive rubric (of which the dream is only one aspect) has been less likely than any other to become a topic of extended commentary. Sleep is indeed a recognized specialty of scientific research, and medical advice disseminated via the internet and other media affirms that adequate sleep is indispensable. At the same time, apart from the critique and interpretation of dreams, this physiological sine qua non has tended to receive little direct attention in the reflective discourse of such fields as psychoanalysis, philosophy, and literary criticism. Hence while the dominion of sleep is obvious in that a third or more of the typical human life is consumed in what is basically a 3 Either/Or (1843), Vol. 1, trans. David F. and Lillian Marvin Swenson (Garden City: Anchor, 1959), 27. 4 “Gaius Caligula,” Suetonius, trans. J.C. Rolfe (Cambridge: Harvard up, 1998), 1:490–93. Suetonius characterizes the tyrannical Caligula as a mentally deranged insomniac, but there is also a manifestly hypnophobic sentiment in the emperor’s “crying out from time to time for daylight and longing for its coming” (1:493). 5 David Bourdon, Warhol biographer and critic, records that the artist “speculated that he and his friends were more productive during the 1960s because … amphetamines provided them more ‘awake time.’ Warhol claimed to need only two or three hours of sleep a night during the mid-1960s … . Warhol liked to think that sleep was becoming obsolete … ” (Warhol [New York: Abrams, 1989], 166).\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n3\n\nnon-activity, this ever-recurrent phenomenon has often endured low prestige (again, until recently) in academic discussions and other cultural arenas.6 Yet it is hardly the case that sleep never qualified as a topic of reflective consideration at variance with the diatribic pronouncements of hypnophic preachers, rulers, and philosophers as well. In the wake of Plato’s cogent articulation of a pejorative outlook on sleep (to be examined below), Aristotle’s relatively benign view in the Parva naturalia very early on established an alternative precedent that, if sometimes overlooked, also spawned thoughtful responses. Hegel’s Anthropology, for instance, contains an infrequently read yet provocative sub-treatise on the condition of dormancy. Human consciousness is therein framed as a product of the proddings brought by the awakened senses and reason upon the ongoing données and habits of the unactuated, dormant self. Freud’s “Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams” (1916) and Ferenczi’s “Sleep and Coitus” (a chapter in Thalassa: A Theory of Genitality [1924]) are necessary inclusions in any conceivable reading list on the subject of sleep. Portions of Emmanuel Levinas’s Existence and Existents (De l’existence à l’existent [1947]) are similarly essential along with a succinct sequel by Maurice Blanchot in L’espace littéraire (1955). The lucid and penetrating commentaries of Millard Meiss (“Sleep in Venice” [1966]) and Leo Steinberg (“Picasso’s Sleepwatchers” [1968]) are distinguished early breakthroughs during an era of widespread scholarly myopia regarding the aesthetic capacities of the dormant state.7 6 Exemplary instances of what is now a flourishing trend are cited below, but it is also worth pointing out that it is not unusual for major scholarly assessments of visual art or literature to sidestep core issues of sleep (and dream as well) almost entirely. This observation applies to W.J.T. Mitchell’s splendid What Do Pictures Want? The Lives and Loves of Images (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2005) even as Mitchell briefly refers to a suggestively multi-layered sculpture by Andrew Gormley, entitled Bed (259–60). Mitchell also looks at the tale of the Maid of Corinth, who – in fable at least – invented drawing when she sketched the shadow of her beloved’s visage on a wall, shortly before he embarked on a journey. In Wright of Derby’s pictorial rendition of the legend, the beloved has lapsed into sleep, providing the young woman an occasion – while the man is temporarily reduced to a shadowy, cognitive outline – to record his profile and hence preserve it during his absence. Yet Mitchell bypasses this stellar depiction of sleep to discuss a lesser-known engraving of the incident, a work in which the young man remains awake (60–68). Similarly illustrative of this trend are the infrequent if cogent references (190–95, 682, 683) to the intersections of dream and representation in art since 1900: modernism antimodernism postmodernism, a vast, encyclopedic chronicle authored by Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, YveAlain Bois, and Benjamin Buchloh (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2004). 7 To a degree, Aristotle’s theory of sleep preserves the negative Platonic perspective to be explored below. Aristotle defines sleep as first of all a “privation of waking” (453b:27–28). ­(Citations of the Parva naturalia are drawn from the Loeb text with translation by W.S. Hett\n\n4\n\nchapter 1 [Cambridge: Harvard up, 1995].) While Aristotle thus perceives dormancy as not simply an absence of the conscious state but as a deprivation of that state, his position is also a primary source for the “rest” theory, a view that welcomes sleep because of its putative powers to restore and revitalize both physical and mental capacities. To the extent that sleep is an intermission of the ongoing labors of existence (and preeminently those of a presumed higher or “common” faculty of perception [455a:13–28]), Aristotle contends that sleep is “necessary and beneficial” (455b: 20) and that its object is “to preserve animal life” (455b: 22–23). But along with the relative approbation conveyed in the term anapausis or “letting up” of daily narratives, a less sanguine view emerges as well: Aristotle comments that “in a sense sleep is an epileptic fit” (457a: 9–10); such a seizure could hardly be welcome relief from life’s labors. For Aristotle and his tradition, sleep is also tightly linked to the processes of digestion, during the course of which “sleep is a sort of concentration (sunodos) or natural recession (antiperistasis) inwards of … hot matter” (457b: 1–3). Awakening takes place as the conclusion of the digestive sequence. Aristotle thus construes the sleep-cycle as in toto a salubrious one (458a:30–33). But there are also insinuations of undesirability not only in the parallel drawn with the disease of epilepsy, but also in the use of the term antiperistasis, which implies a regression, a going backwards, a vague sense of contrarian circumstances. The “rest” theory eventually receives very favorable treatment in Hegel’s Anthropology. Hegel reworks and synthesizes Aristotle’s notions of anapausis, sunodos, and antiperistasis with notable ingenuity in order to stage sleep as an “undifferentiated universality” (127) (“ununterschiedenen Allgemeinheit,” [104]; “unterschiedslose Einheit,” [107]) of the self out of which the being-for-itself (Fürsichsein [104]) of conscious life can derive distinctiveness and vitality. Hegel observes with approbation that dormancy allows a “withdrawal from the world of determinateness” and “into the universal essence of subjectivity” (127). (Citations are drawn from the German edition with English translation by M.J. Petry, Hegel’s Philosophy of Subjective Spirit, Vol. 2 [Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1978].) Examining passages in the Parva naturalia and elsewhere in Aristotle, Alfredo Ferrarin concludes that Hegel “shares with Aristotle a teleological interpretation of sleep” (Hegel and Aristotle [Cambridge: Cambridge up, 2001], 267). Hegel in any case locates in sleep an abiding background for reflective consciousness, arguing that it is ultimately in itself that “the waking soul finds the content-determinateness of its dormant nature … ” (Subjective Spirit, 147). The senses, according to Hegel, form a bridge between the “organic” or vegetative mode of life associated with the dormant state and the “animal” mode evident when an organism is awake. What the entity senses, internally or externally, is in some sense dormant because it is divorced from the appropriating, reflecting, and deciding processes of the optimized waking self. Perpetually acting upon the dormant side of the self and offering it up to the intentional operations of the awake soul, the sentient system synthesizes the two sides of the self and prompts the waking consciousness or “being-for-itself” to advance in its individuation. The Hegelian view dovetails with the notion (explained below, note 18) that the experience of sleep can be regarded as a cognitive horizon. While a fuller exposé of the central commentaries on sleep is at this point not feasible, it may suffice for now to consider, along with Aristotle and Hegel, Freud’s “Metapsychological Supplement,” in which the notion of sleep as rest again receives endorsement – or at least apparently so, with rather strongly implied reservations. Together with love and grief, sleep\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n5\n\nGiven a record of criticism and commentary that is relatively thin in comparison with the amount of writing devoted to – for instance – dreams, death, or sex, it is not without paradox that the postmodern era (which begins at least by the 1960s and has perhaps not yet concluded) becomes the age of the hypnoglyph.8 For sleep becomes implicated – if not always acknowledged – in virtually every form of discourse: in advertising, in the sober commentary of scholars, in news stories of sleep cafés and of drowsy personnel in nuclear power plants, is for Freud among the “normal prototypes of morbid affections” (Collected Papers, trans. Joan Riviere [New York: Basic Books, 1959], 4:137). Freud then famously proceeds to assert that “somatically, sleep is an act which reproduces intra-uterine existence, fulfilling the conditions of repose, warmth and absence of stimulus; indeed, in sleeping, many people resume the foetal position” (137–38). Yes, this is rest that may be indispensable for the survival of the human organism, but it is also a condition typified by “an almost complete withdrawal from the surrounding world” and by regression of the libido or pleasure principle “to the point of restoring the primitive narcissism” (138). Sleep is thus for Freud, it seems, a pause or pausis that, if inevitable, has gone kata instead of ana. Yet it is anything but devoid of clinical interest because of the intervention of iridescent dreams prompted by submerged psychic encumbrances that intriguingly frustrate the ego’s desire to temporarily obtain “an absolute narcissism” (141) during episodes of dormancy. 8 The temporal boundaries of postmodernism are subject to much debate. The present study is in overall agreement with the view of Charles Jencks and others that the postmodern is “in its infancy in the 1960s” (What is Post-Modernism?, 2nd edition [New York: St. Martin’s, 1987], 9). Data relevant for this study suggest that it is reasonable to push the first promptings of the postmodern back a little further, into the ’50s and to concur with John Storey’s assessment that “it is in the late 1950s and early 1960s that we see the beginnings of what is now understood as postmodernism” (“Postmodernism and Popular Culture,” Routledge Companion to Postmodernism, ed. Stuart Sim, 2nd ed. [London: Routledge, 2004], 133). This perspective can be said to correlate with Fredric Jameson’s pronouncement that “the postmodern begins to make its appearance wherever the modernization process no longer has archaic features and obstacles to overcome and has triumphantly implanted its own autonomous logic” (Postmodernism, or, the Logic of Late Capitalism [Durham: Duke up, 1991], 366). The notion that modernism can almost mysteriously outdo itself is illustrated, for instance, in the case of the 1957 Sputnik launch, an event also quite suggestive of the surveillance and enhanced watchfulness that have become deeply embedded in the comings and goings of contemporary life – and that ultimately affect the sleep situations of most global citizens. As for the conclusion of postmodernism, the question is once more a challenging one. Steven Connor finds the postmodern continuing through the 1990s, its “rate of expansion” slowing, and the movement becoming more associated with academic discourse than a “condition of things in the world, whether the world of art, culture, economics,” etc. (“Introduction,” The Cambridge Companion to Postmodernism, ed. Steven Connor [Cambridge: Cambridge up, 2004], 4). And as for the post-’90s scenario, Connor also proposes that “postmodern discourse may now be entering a new phase of productive dissipation, in which some of the very cultural themes and phenomena that it has made its concern are now themselves achieving a kind of autonomy” (11–12).\n\n6\n\nchapter 1\n\nin studies of fatigue experienced by commercial airline pilots, in reports of crime as well as in the alibis of the accused, in political campaigns when there is concern over which candidate can best handle 3 a.m. crises, in film and other art forms, in tales of insomnia, and in an array of sleeping paraphernalia. One such accessory is the eye pillow, available from an internet merchandiser, the Barefoot Yoga Company.9 And when one wishes to awake, the alternatives are numerous, with varied devices rendering natural sounds and sunlight simulations instead of the predictable buzzers, bells, and melodies. Then there are the “bio-alarm” devices engineered to monitor the sleeper’s movements or even cerebral electrical discharges with the aim of arousing the user during light sleep; that is, when the individual can be awakened – presumably – with minimal stress or aggravation.10 The critical, theoretical accompaniment of the exploding representational interest in sleep during postmodernism has been relatively tardy in developing. The thoughtful commentaries cited above by Meiss and Steinberg in fact evoke a fully intact modernism even as its premises are eroding. A special issue of the Jungian journal Parabola: Myth and the Quest for Meaning, published in 1982 and entitled Sleep, is groundbreaking yet is a compendium of traditional religious and other statements about sleep-states and eschews provocative critique in the areas of, for instance, sexuality or ideology. An analogous yet, overall, a more venturesome selection of critical and literary texts is found in Le sommeil, (1983) a special issue (edited by Béatrice Didier) of the French journal Corps Écrits. The next year, postmodern sleep-theory indisputably emerges with Visages du sommeil, an anthology of essays edited by Michel Covin for another French journal, Revue des Sciences Humaines. Covin and his collaborators detect, delineate, and inhabit a multi-purviewed sleep-cosmos; herein the discourses of philosophy, the novel, poetry, Christian iconography, autobiography, railway travel, monastic life, and military combat are all brought into play.11 9\n\nInformation is provided by the company at http://www.barefootyoga.com/meditation/ eye-pillows. For a brief discussion, see the Wall Street Journal, “A Silky Pillow for Slipping into Sleep,” 3 Feb. 1995, B1. 10 The “Travel Sleep Sound Machine,” for instance, offers several natural sounds for awakening–or as an aid to falling asleep (www.sharperimage.com). The bio-alarm is handled by Sleep Cycle (http://www.sleepcycle.com). At least one literate user, however, found the latter device unworthy of the expense. See Dean Skylar’s “Apptitude: Sleep Cycle didn’t help him wake refreshed – or at all” (Washington Post, 17 July 2014 https://www .washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/apptitude-sleep-cycle-didnt-help-him-wake -refreshed--or-at-all/2014/07/14/daf2ba22-faed-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html. 11 The Corps écrit collection is attention-worthy especially because of its inclusion of an astute essay by Jean Starobinski, “Rêve et immortalité chez Baudelaire” (45–56), and even more so\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n7\n\nCloser to the present, the trickle of monographs on sleep has become a r­ivulet, some of them popularized medical studies of sleep and dreams.12 Along with works on the physiology of sleep and related topics, a modest number have engaged issues of significance for visual art and literature. Among the most notable, Paul Martin’s Counting Sheep: The Science and Pleasures of\n\n12\n\ndue to a wide-ranging phenomenological foray by Louis Marin, “À l’éveil des métamorphoses: Poussin (1625–1635)” (31–43). (The essay eventually became a chapter in Marin’s monograph, Sublime Poussin, trans. Catherine Porter [Stanford: Stanford up, 1999].) Marin here gives himself up to “a vagabondage of thought and imagination on the motif of the sleeping body” (Porter, trans., 165) (“ … un vagabondage de la penseé et de l’imagination sur le motif du corps endormi” [39]). Depictions of sleep in several of Poussin’s paintings lead Marin to conclusions that cut across the full spectrum of artistic discourses. With painting seen as the premier art form, he discovers that representation typically accomplishes “the transmutation of the flesh of things into the fragile surface of colors and the fiction of their presence … : an awakening of the thing from the sleep of being where it burrows down” (Porter, trans. 168) (“ … la transmutation de la chair des choses dans la fragile surface des couleurs et la fiction de leur présence … : éveil de la chose du sommeil de l’être où elle s’enfouit … ” [41]). With regard to the Revue des sciences humaines collection, editor Michel Covin’s opening essay, “Un moment difficile à passer, mais vite oublié” (7–30), is particularly incisive and farreaching. A problem is identified and pursued with energy, if at times with a tinge of overstatement. Covin takes issue with the “hypnophobic drift of civilisation” (“la tendance hypnophobe de notre civilization” [8]), a phenomenon tied to “the multiform applications of a moral code of vigilance” (“les applications multiformes d’un code moral de la vigilance” [29]). Covin finds that the code is apparently universal; “there is no civilization where sleep is cultivated as a strength, nor sought after as an end in itself”; (“ … il n’est aucune civilisation où le sommeil soit cultivé comme valeur, ni recherché comme fin en soi” [29–30]). The root of this troubling dynamic, argues Covin, is Christianity, for “in its representational system … one will find the concrete doctrines that this denial of sleep has instigated and those which are its more or less deformed reflection in the field of philosophy.” (nw, trans.) (“C’est donc dans son système de représentations qu’on trouvera les doctrines concrètes que ce déni du sommeil a suscitées et celles qui en sont le reflect, plus ou moins déformé, dans le champ philosophique” [30].) Covin’s insights and arguments often overlap, if they do not coincide, with those of this study, especially with regard to the religious dimension in general and Descartes in particular. (For an expanded exposition of Covin’s perspective, see Une esthétique du sommeil [Paris: Beauchesne, 1990].) Benjamin Reiss brings forward the valuable point that the expanded interest in sleep as a subject of scientific research does not directly correlate with enhanced cultural understanding and/or tolerance of sleep experiences. Reiss comments as follows: The factory bells and moral reformers of the nineteenth century positioned sleep as a vehicle for or an obstacle toward productivity, alienable from the social life of the sleeper. In the twenty-first century, the sleep clinician hovering over the electroencephalograph monitor studies not the person but the isolated “sleep-as-thing,” concretized by a set of waving lines. See “Sleeping at Waldern Pond: Thoreau, Abnormal Temporality, and the Modern Body,” American Literature 85.1 [March 2013], 20.\n\n8\n\nchapter 1\n\nSleep and Dreams (2002) is a wide-ranging and informally written examination of sleep pathology and the cultural locus of sleep, a project in the course of which the author frequently calls attention to literary anecdotes and parallels. A. Roger Ekirch’s At Day’s Close: Night in Times Past (2005) is a meaningful and astute historical consideration of sleep and nighttime behavior, mostly prior to 1900. In another thoughtful study, Sleep and Society: Sociological Ventures into the (Un)known (2005), Simon J. Williams admirably mediates and qualifies the perception that “sleep, by and large, was something of a blind spot as far as sociologists were concerned.”13 The French philosopher JeanLuc Nancy’s Tombe de sommeil (2007) is a witty and often convoluted inquest into some of the most basic issues awakened by this recurring, ubiquitous experience.14 In the visual arts, dormir/sleep (edited by Alexis Fabry et al., 2000) is extraordinary, and though subtitled photography literature design, it is primarily a cascade of photographic images chronicling the nuances, données, and elusive coordinates of sleep in a global context. Inter-art criticism on the resources of sleep has been minimal, a lack that the current study aims to alleviate.15 13 14\n\n15\n\nS.J. Williams, Sleep and Society: Sociological Ventures into the (Un)known (London: Routledge, 2005), 2. Thus Nancy writes with an eloquence that is both cryptic and insightful – and as if in response to Louis Marin’s apprehension (see above, note 11) that sleep so often entails metamorphosis: … sleep is not a metamorphosis. At most, it can be understood as an endomorphosis, as internal formation or as the formation of an interiority where the interior, sealed up, might appear entirely projected within the intentions and extensions of waking existence … . This endomorphosis is provisional and always suspended at the limits of form, the formation of a substance that is amorphous and poorly identified and of which the most common and best conceived of onset is nothing other than one of falling, collapse, and disconnecting … . (nw, trans.) ( … le sommeil n’est pas métamorphose. Tout au plus pourrait-il être compris comme une endomorphose, comme la formation interne ou comme la formation d’une ­intériorité là où l’intérieur, scellé, paraissait tout entier projeté dans les intentions et dans les e­ xtensions de l’existence vigile … Endomorphose provisoire et toujours suspendue aux limites de la forme même, formation d’une substance amorphe et mal identifiable dont l’allure la plus commune et la mieux dessinée n’est autre précisément que celle de la chute, de l’affaissement et de la déliaison … ” Tombe de sommeil [Paris: Galilée, 2007], 16–17). Among the varied antecedents for this project, to be noted also are the intriguing rapprochements of sleep-related visual art and literature scattered throughout Jacqueline Risset’s Puissances de sommeil (Paris: Seuil, 1997) and Jacqueline Kelen’s Les barques du sommeil (Coursegoules: Reyne de Coupe, 1997).\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n9\n\nDuring postmodernism and the early third millennium ce as well (again, arguably an era marked by a continuing postmodern aesthetics), verbal and visual texts featuring sleep form, if not a genre in the usual sense, at least a semiotic alliance. In any case, works of the sort here considered – that is, hypnoglyphs – reveal traits that Marjorie Perloff has cogently argued are relevant in identifying postmodern genres.16 The sleep-centered work of art or hypnoglyph undertakes to present the unpresentable and problematizes prior genre distinctions; a traditional genre suggested in such a work may acquire a residual or even simulacral aura. A literary or visual text of this type usually portrays a confrontation with the other as sleep, an unsayable dimension of psychic life. And in nearly every instance, there is a blurring of boundaries, not only between visual and written representational modes, but between such areas as “high” and popular art forms, sleep and its psychic antonym (wakefulness), and sleep and its cultural antonym (work). In addition to such features that are unmistakably postmodern, several other common elements are nearly pandemic in these highly diverse contemporary verbal and visual texts. The sleep-centered work usually exhibits a representational pattern of disguise or camouflage that covers complex significations beneath a seemingly unproblematic exterior. Beneath an apparently placid surface, tokens of deception or illusion may lurk, or perhaps memoirs of sacred narrative (mythic or religious), or a mélange of allegoresque tracings, or there may be a confirmation of a transdiscursive flattening derived primarily from modernist visual techniques. Gender polemics are frequently intense, and in all cases, desire, especially erotic desire, is ambiguously projected or implicitly thwarted. Such works, in the act of invoking one or more pre-texts, tend to exploit a passé and clearly modernist context in which sleep assists in developing a stable configuration of meaning. Especially at issue is the modernist conception of time as a relatively unified, predictable, and ultimately fulfilling phenomenon, now disunified or “multi-perspectival” and susceptible to troubling dislocation within the contemporary framework of the hypnoglyph.17 16\n\n17\n\nGeneric possibilities for postmodernism are explored in Postmodern Genres, edited by Marjorie Perloff (Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 1989), who outlines the possible coordinates of such genres (most notably on pages 7–8). The term “multi-perspectival” has been usefully employed to describe postmodern temporality by Peter Carravetta, Prefaces to the Diaspora: Rhetorics, Allegory, and the Interpretation of Postmodernity (West Lafayette: Purdue up, 1991), 158. In Chronoschisms: Time, Narrative, and Postmodernism (Cambridge: Cambridge up, 1997), Ursula K. Heise invaluably anatomizes the splintering of a transcendent durée during the postmodern era. Among other points, Heise remarks that “the simultaneity of disparate geographical spaces and historical periods in the virtual space of the tv screen has been accompanied\n\n10\n\nchapter 1\n\nIn many of the examples discussed below, a discursive ground can be located in the linearity of a reclining figure or figures. For the postmodern, this horizontal line is no longer an implicitly apprehended horizon as it was for modernism, when it often indicated a baseline, the bottom threshold of human experience. It is relevant to recall Heraclitus’s view that breathing was the sole observable phenomenon that distinguished the dormant individual from the corpse. And without much risk of overstatement, it can be argued that depictions of sleep from antiquity through modernism tended to exploit this singular condition – along with its neighbor, awakening – as alternate horizons in the sense of vantage points or expansions of representational space, hence also discursive gambits or openers for exploration of one or more aspects of lived experience. (Death is here included, for in the wake of Plutarch, it has been often held that sleep is best understand as a prefiguring of death, of whatever lies on the other side of life.) In the era of the hypnoglyph considerably more so than previously, the reclining and somnolent human figure is a locale of unrest at a time when the notion of an horizon – a set of premises or the presumed space of discourse – has receded from traditional (e.g., circadian) rhythms of life and reappeared, very broadly, in the mechanisms of sign-production as well as in the ebulliencies of capital. Or it could also be said that, instead of either sleep with its languors or awakening with its quickenings as possible foci for perusing the life and times of the highest of primates, postmodernism has adopted a distinctive mentational stance, a sense of having always already awakened.18\n\n18\n\nby another and closely related feature of the postmodern experience of temporality: the expectation of and desire for instant availability” (25). Also worth endorsing is Heise’s perspective on computerized communication in such forms as email and bulletin boards. Heise comments that, bringing about an “acceleration of normal temporality, computer use immerses the individual in a ‘hyper-present’ of sorts, a hyper-intensified immediacy that focuses the user’s attention on a rapid succession of micro-events and thereby makes it more difficult to envision even the short-term past or future” (26). According to Sextus Empiricus – an ancient polemicist on behalf of scepticism–, Heraclitus believed that during sleep, “when the channels of perception are shut, our mind is sundered from its kinship with the surrounding, and breathing is the only point of attachment to be preserved, like a kind of root” (G.S. Kirk, J.E. Raven, and M. Schofield, eds. and trans., The Presocratic Philosophers: A Critical History with a Selection of Texts, 2nd ed. [Cambridge: Cambridge up, 2002], 205). Plutarch’s frequently cited and modified comments are found in a treatise entitled the “Consolation to Apollonius”: “Neither hath [anyone] spoken much amiss who calls sleep the lesser mysteries of death; for sleep is ­really the first initiation into the mysteries of death” (Plutarch’s Morals Translated by Several Hands, ed. William W. Goodwin [Boston: Little, Brown, 1870], 1:311). The notion of “horizon” here entertained is mostly Heideggerean. John D. Caputo points out that, for Heidegger, “horizon” indicates “the ‘look’ or the ‘sight’ (Aussehen) in terms of which we line up or sight objects, thereby making the objectivity of things possible.” At the same time, as Caputo points out, “Beyond the object-with-horizon, there\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n11\n\nIt is in any case likely that the most significant trait of the hypnoglyph is that narrative resistance is here foregrounded, typically vis-à-vis a frustrated or at least mediated diaristic impulse. The diary, a recording of internal and external circadian transactions, is the counter-text that the hypnoglyph wishes to write, the primary prior genre that it problematizes. Prior to hermeneutic inspection of the hypnoglyph, however, it is necessary to consider the notion of narrative resistance and its relation to the phenomenon of sleep.19 And certainly, other topics require consideration as well, including the bedrock of modernist representation of sleep and dream, a matrix offering numerous precedents that the postmodern era has frequently violated as well as reflected upon with seeming regret.\n\nSleep and Narrative Resistance\n\nA full history and exposition of the notion of narrative resistance have yet to be written. A provocative preliminary sketch has been rendered by S­ vetlana\n\n19\n\nis the open itself of which the horizonal view or circle of vision is but a perspectival or partial view. If the horizon lets the object be … it remains true that something lets the horizon be, and that is the ‘open’” (Radical Hermeneutics: Repetition, Deconstruction, and the Hermeneutic Project [Bloomington: Indiana up, 1988], 99. It is thus not unreasonable to claim that modernist verbal and visual arts typically construe sites of dormancy as horizonal, perspective-granting scenarios within a larger cognitive expanse. See also, for well-framed and lucid comments on Heidegger’s horizonal thinking, Søren Overgaard, Husserl and Heidegger on Being in the World (Dordrecht: Springer, 2004), 126–130. The hypnoglyph as here described neither coincides with nor is totally disconnected from an object of the same name that is the focal point of John Ciardi’s science fiction fable, “The Hypnoglyph” (1953) (published under the pseudonym, John Anthony, in Portals of Tomorrow: The Best Tales of Science Fiction and Other Fantasy, ed. August Derleth [New York: Rinehart, 1954], 1–9). In Ciardi’s narrative, the hypnoglyph is a large extraterrestrial seed – similar to an avocado’s – in which a slight depression or groove has been carved. A character in the story begins rubbing the hypnoglyph, cannot extricate himself from doing so, and is eventually hypnotized. At this point the narrator’s plump wife prepares to enter. She has been imported from the distant planet that has engendered the hypnoglyph and which is a pays de cockaigne where most of the women “lounge about on delicately arranged hill terraces and just lie motionless soaking up sun energy or working up a little voodoo mostly based on hypnotism and tactile gratification” (Ciardi, 7). It seems certain that the narrator’s wife will slaughter the victim and harvest his flesh, which will apparently serve as her food. Ciardi does not here inaugurate a postmodern genre or sub-genre, but “The Hypnoglyph” as cautionary narrative harbors some of the negative associations, traditionally tied to sleep, that continue in the hypnoglyph as representational kind. Hypnotism in Ciardi’s tale – not at all a vehicle for amelioration and truth – simply leads to a sleep-state that is shot through with lassitude, peril, and resistance to wholesome narratives.\n\n12\n\nchapter 1\n\n­ lpers and Michael Baxandall, who, in a study of the eighteenth-century A ­Venetian painter Tiepolo, observe that “some artists can be described as resisting narrative. The stilled, muted figures staring out of Manet’s pictures stop our conversation and make it difficult for us to tell their tale.”20 Narrative resistance is thus not a factor inherent in all visual art; instead, this resistance is tied to how a representation is conceived and executed. In tandem with narrative resistance in pictorial formats, a related version – and one that emerges from what is arguably a more basic, less premeditated cognitive stratum – is found in the discourse of resistance to psychoanalytic processes. Resistance to the analyst’s efforts to induce self-insight is a foundational concept in Freudian theory, and Roy Schafer reminds us that inescapable blockage in the narrative of a psychoanalytic treatment “is often sly, hidden, secretive, obdurate … .”21 Schafer discovers a factor of poorly articulated selfhood or disclaimed agency at the heart of the resistance dynamism.22 He calls attention to the high degree of vigilance of which the analyst must be capable if the resistance dynamism is to be effectively confronted and countered.23 The emergent hermeneutic topic of narrative resistance also has an intriguing precedent in the theory of electrical resistance, first enunciated by Georg Ohm. The flow of electricity is retarded in varying degrees by virtually all substances that can serve as conductors.24 From here, no great hermeneutic audacity is required to inquire or search after an analogy between a general theory of electricity and one of the human psyche. Indeed, it is worth recalling that in his early Project for a Scientific Psychology (1895), Freud posited two kinds of nerve cells: perception-consciousness neurons that offer no resistance to stimuli, and less excitable cells susceptible to memory inscription.25 And 20\n\nTiepolo and the Pictorial Intelligence (New Haven: Yale up, 1994), 41–42. Alpers and Baxandall also note “an alternative to narrative intelligibility” in ancient Assyrian reliefs of battle scenes. 21 “Narration in the Psychoanalytic Dialogue” in On Narrative, ed. W.J.T.

James Strachey et. al (London: Hogarth, 1953), 298–300. See also Appendix C, 392–97, in the same volume. Also worth recalling are Jacques Derrida’s comments on this Freudian aperçu in one of this wizard of French philosophy’s most respected and seminal essays, “Freud and the\n\nIntroduction: From Hypnos to the Hypnoglyph\n\n13\n\njust as resistance is a key component in Freud’s pioneering hypothesis of the flow of neuronal energy, it can be suggested that this broad and widely applicable notion of resistance undergoes substantial revision – in effect, a metamorphosis – to account for a significant amount of the psychic energy expended during the psychoanalytic transaction.26\n\n26\n\nScene of Writing” (Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass [U of Chicago P, 1978], ­196–231). Endorsing Freud’s claim that there could be a very basic neuronal foundation for the resources of memory, Derrida submits that “memory, thus, is not a psychical property among others; it is the very essence of the psyche: resistance, and precisely, thereby, an opening to the effraction of the trace” (201). From resistance to memory and back again – and with resistance for the moment a psychic sine qua non –, it may well be relevant to correlate the resistance of sleep with that of memory. These two manifestations of resistance can surely be apprehended, in divergent ways, as indispensable cognitive functions. It can also be argued that memory is a bivalent dynamism: it is both active and passive, both process and archived psychic fact. Along with whatever else is involved in memory, it requires an energy that inscribes information, residua of perception and other experiences that resist removal; whatever is remembered remains embedded and dormant until suitable circumstances intervene and activate or awaken it. Freud’s thoughts on the nature of nerve cells were likely contemporaneous with his formulation of the notion of resistance. Kenneth Levin notes that “Freud’s earliest published comments on resistance appear in Studies on Hysteria (1895), but it seems that he first recognized the phenomenon about two years earlier” (Freud’s Early Psychology of the Neuroses: A Historical Perspective [Pittsburgh: U of Pittsburgh P, 1978], 101). Levin also refers (103) to patients “first seen by Freud late in 1892, and it seems certain that his observations of resistance in the ensuing months were a major stimulus to his shift to the defense concept and to his preparation of ‘The Neuro-Psychoses of Defence’ (1894).” It should be pointed out, of course, that the dynamism of resistance that Freud theorizes differs in key dimensions from the notion of resistance as a factor in the formation and retention of specific memories. Resistance for Freud becomes a psychic capacity (usually unacknowledged by the analysand who demonstrates it) to oppose the raising to consciousness of “pathogenic” material (Freud, quoted by Levin, 102). For a representative discussion of resistance in the context of present-day psychotherapeutic practice, see Jerrold R. Brandell, Psychodynamic Social Work (New York: Columbia up, 2004), especially 187–88, 190–91, 197–98, and 205–19. Brandell frames resistance as a manifestation of psychic concerns seemingly removed from neurological determinations. At times, however, intimations of an underlying or “archaic” model of nerve-based resistance creep through. Brandell specifies, for instance, that “excessive compliance, emotionality, undue emphasis on reality considerations, somatization, and dreams and fantasies used in the service of resistance are among … clinical manifestations reported in the literature” (190). Brandell also refers to the client’s “habitual mode of relating” to others as a factor in the dynamics of resistance (213). On such occasions, the distressed\n\n14\n\nchapter 1\n\nThe view that sleep is distinguished by its resistance to narrative is of impressive antiquity. The Old Testament Book of Proverbs, for instance, contains an injunction indicating an antinomy (to be discussed below) between sleep and narratives of economic advancement: Do not love sleep, or else you will come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread. (20: 13)27 The second book of the Iliad opens with another terse but foundational example. Zeus maintains a vigil while Agamemnon sleeps, and the king of the gods sends a dream in the form of Nestor to the king of men. The venerable Nestor speaks as follows: Son of wise Atreus breaker of horses, are you sleeping? He should not sleep night long who is a man burdened with counsels and responsibility for a people and cares so many. (2: 23–25)28 The relaxation and retreat of sleep are set against a compelling agenda of cultural goals epitomized in the apparent opportunity presented to the Achaeans to effect the destruction of Troy. The dream is in fact misleading and provokes the demise of many of the Greeks, but the basic values it utilizes are not questioned; the dream is plausible precisely because its format and its assumptions are unimpeachable. The issue receives elaboration in Book 7 of Plato’s Laws, where the incompatibility of sleep with the ongoing, constructive activities of the polis is brought to the fore. The capacity to reject sleep is here by no means a virtue particularly expected of rulers; vigilance is now everyone’s concern. Drawing perhaps upon the exhortation to martial alertness sounded in the Iliad, the Athenian stranger who dominates the dialogue argues that: … everyone should be up during the night performing a good part of the business of politics as well as of the household … . A great deal of sleep\n\n27 28\n\nindividual would appear to have become “hard-wired” – conditioned by long-dormant stimuli – in a way or ways that unpleasantly complicate his or her daily life.

For while a person sleeps he is worth nothing – no more than one who isn’t living. But whoever among us cares for living and thinking to a special degree stays up the longest time, reserving only so much time as is useful for his health, and that isn’t much, once a fine habit has been established. (808b: 1-c: 3)29 The sagacious Athenian thus discovers a dissonance in dormancy that excludes it from the intrinsic harmonies that establish the excellence of the individual, the family, and the polis. Unlike the many activities that can be incorporated into subtly nuanced cultural narratives, sleep resists any overall social coordination. Also, in interrupting consciousness, sleep undermines the intellective processes of – and perhaps even the very concept of – an independent, thinking subject. Alongside these objections to sleep on the basis of its resistance to narrative, countless narratives can be cited in which sleep is significant or salient. The passage from the Iliad in which Nestor chides the sleep of Agamemnon is, certainly, one such example. Also to be acknowledged are the very numerous occasions, obvious or not, when sleep is condoned or even appreciated. For instance, sleep has been referred to as “sweet” with cloying frequency, and it is pertinent that the practice is already evident, again in Homer (e.g., Iliad 1.610, where “hupnos” is accompanied by the epithet “glukus,” hence seems to be of equal standing with nectar [gluku nectar, 1.598]).30 Yet despite an attendant ameliorative trend, it is a central tenet of this study that a depreciation of sleep has generally had the upper hand in a spectrum of discourses, across cultures and periods of history. For now, it is quite relevant to consider how an element apparently incompatible with narrative can contribute to its strength. And aspects of sleep that constitute its quarrel with narrative should be isolated. But to begin with, what are some of the basic requirements for the forward march of narrative to which dormancy fails to conform? How is sleep diegetically deficient? In the interests of locating a focal point amid a welter of narrative theories, it is useful to revisit the familiar and often contested distinction b­ etween ­description 29 30\n\nThomas L. Prangle, trans. (New York: Basic Books, 1980), 198. John Miles Foley presents an astute analysis of the Homeric phrase “glukus hupnos” within a broader discussion of sleep as a double-pronged sign in both the Iliad and the Odyssey (Homer’s Traditional Art [University Park: Pennsylvania State up, 1999], 229–35). Among points, he underscores “the double reality of sleep as both welcome release and problematic vulnerability” (231).\n\n16\n\nchapter 1\n\nand narration. W.J.T. Mitchell has maintained that “it is really a phantom distinction, with no really clear boundary between narrative and description.”31 Yet a difference between the two is generally salient when sleep is involved. In literature, depictions of dormant individuals can be readily linked to description, which can be defined as a necessary aspect of verbal representation that focuses on details and parts of objects at the expense of their wholeness.32 The writer who energetically describes must also take measures to shore up his text’s illusion of integrality. Amid the welter of narrative theories, it is helpful to briefly revisit Lessing’s familiar argument in the Laocoön (as conveniently phrased by Alexander Gelley): “ … succession of time is the province of the poet just as space is that of the painter.”33 This dichotomy apparently makes depictions of sleeping individuals more appropriate for visual than for verbal art. At the same time, in visual art, especially in classical Greece, there may well be a narrative drift; “still-life” painting is a specific genre that occurs rather late in the history of Western art. Thus in painting and sculpture – yet not as much, it would seem, as in the more temporally-dependent verbal text–, the immobile body of the sleeper tends to retard the flow if not the rush of temporal progression. For the present discussion, what is perhaps the central significance of narrative discourse emerges in a comment on Lessing by David Wellbery: “Narrative alleviates the problem of dissolution that confronts us in description … . Narrative fulfills the aesthetic function because it maintains the structure of perception, the totalizing regard within the present instant.”34 The suspended consciousness and perception of the sleeper in the verbal or visual text are thus in conflict with the totalizing drift of the narrative elements. A temporal element is detectable in Wellbery’s argument when he implies that there is an optimal present moment, an altogether coherent and cohesive “now.” And among the many narrative theorists who address the question of time, Paul Ricoeur with particular directness develops as his central position the view that “narrative composition, taken in its broadest sense, constitutes\n\n31 32 33 34\n\nPicture Theory: Essays on Verbal and Visual Representation (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1994), 191. On this debate, see also Gérard Genette, “The Frontiers of Narrative,” Figures of Literary Discourse, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York: Columbia up, 198), 127–44. Narrative Crossings: Theory and Pragmatics of Prose Fiction (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins up, 1987), 11.

Her assertion is based on what Lessing called the “pregnant moment.” This phrase refers to the key instant on which the visual rendition of an action-sequence typically focuses, and which, Steiner explains, is – in its temporal and spatial isolation – all but static. These suggestive moments, instead of furthering narrative, attenuate but do not eliminate it, Steiner concludes.37 Lessing’s concept of the “pregnant moment” no doubt deserves to be considered further in the present context.38 Perhaps what most stands out is the view (shared by Lessing and Steiner) that the aura of a decisive juncture, of an essential moment that the visual artist attempts to recreate, tends to be minimally narrational. It is appropriate, therefore, to find another locution that might more reliably convey (given what typically amounts to a demand, on the part of narrative, for a fulfilled or complete temporality) the impression of what narrative is and what it entails. An adequate term is perhaps “parturitional,” which apprehends and carries through Lessing’s trope. What “parturitional” implies is that, if the representation of a single instant (however momentous or “pregnant”) restricts narrative, then a full-blown narrative segment must convey temporal articulation. Just as parturition in the ordinary sense signif"
