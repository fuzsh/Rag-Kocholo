        "text": "The proliferation of digital technology requires from us to think about images in a new way. We should no longer refer to them only as Greek eikon, that is, reflection or representation, but as experiences, events and special kind of appearing. In contemporary digital culture pictorial appearing is the symptom of the most recent turn towards images, the one that is happening after the “original” pictorial turn that was described by W. J. T. Mitchell and Gottfried Boehm almost three decades ago as the epoch-making new kind of relationship between images and language. Today we witness a different kind of urgency: the one that will exemplify the relationship between analogue images and digital images, representations and post-representations, reality and virtuality, semiotics and phenomenology. In this article I will propose a “transitional” theory of the image that takes into account the wide gap between objects and perceptions, that is, between eikon and pure sensuousness. To this end, I will introduce the four basic modalities of pictorial appearing: temporality, transparency, mediality and referentiality.\n\nThis paper starts from a presumption that the concepts of iconic difference by Gottfried Boehm and immersion by Oliver Grau should be understood as two opposing ways of understanding the nature of images today. The first one aims at making visible all the differences that exist between image and non-image, while the other considers immersion to be the reason for making images undistinguishable from physical reality and thus shifting the discourse on images from signs to phenomena and experiences. Contemporary media images, televisuality, surveillance and manipulation with electronically produced images lead us to a completely new situation where images are not-anymore-distinguishable still not-yet- immersive. In order to explain images which are neither representations nor phenomena of virtual reality I will propose the concept of iconic simultaneity.\n\nThe curious anecdote in Karel van Mander’s biography of Bruegel, where the artist is said to have swallowed all the mountains and rocks during his crossing of the Alps and spat them out again onto canvas and panels upon returning home, has been quoted by almost every Bruegel scholar. Yet it has never been given a full explanation. In this study, it is proposed that the passage, echoing on one level Bruegel’s frequent depiction of overindulging peasants, disguises a highly cultivated reference to the theory of imitation as a digestive process, or innutrition theory, which was widely used by humanist writers of the time to champion vernacular expression.\n\nPublished in California Italian Studies, 6.1 (2016): 1-34. Weblink: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2519f0xw Dante Alighieri, as we understand him and read his poetry, is a construct crafted from posthumous portraiture. Dante's famous profile appears at a pivotal transition point from icon to image, where the aura of saint is transferred to the poet. In this aesthetic creation of identity, portraits and visual representations of Dante are influenced by, and in turn influence, commentaries, translations, and biographies of the poet. This visual and textual synergy is called textual physiognomy, and it reaches an important juncture point in the 19th century, when Dante Gabriel Rossetti--as both artist, critic and translator of Dante--creates a new and influential alternative to the traditional Dantean identity. Rossetti challenges the Dante the 19th century had taken for granted as fact: the divine \"poet saturnine,\" with \"hatchet\" profile, aquiline nose, austere face, and laurel crown. Through his iconoclastic approach to the Dantean portraiture tradition, Rossetti gives Dante a new life by emphasizing the human Dante, the pre-exile Dante before the Divine Comedy.\n\nTo say that the pictorial turn, proclaimed by Mitchell in 1994, is actually more about animals than it is about humans would certainly be an exaggeration. However, the role that three types of animal ‒ dinosaur, calf and sheep ‒ have played in Mitchell’s understanding and explanation of the development of modern visual culture may prove to be extremely revealing and shed new light on how humans have made sense of images throughout history. Even so, one important clarification has to be made at the outset: the species that Mitchell continually refers to are presented and discussed theoretically in his books primarily as incarnations in images of cultural symptoms that go beyond their purely symbolic or iconic meaning. I will start by considering them more like figures of the current state of images and of our relation to them, not as theoretical terms per se. Only as their meaning gradually unfolds will it be possible to discern in them some of the (in)disciplinary logic that broadly characterizes Mitchell’s image theory. I will accordingly conclude that Mitchell is less concerned with theory that preconceptualizes its objects of inquiry and more with the knowledge that deliberately escapes being shaped into a theory in a strict sense. Using different disciplines in order to arrive at different kinds of insight, the American scholar both de-ideologizes older humanistic epistemologies and, simultaneously, creates a foundation for the general study of visual culture that is now largely known as visual studies.\n\nThis art practice-based research aims to rediscover Gilles Deleuze’s theory of art as an aesthetics of Transcendental Realism through the process of Korean Bunche painting. Bunche painting, which I have been working on for twenty years, refers to a thousand-yearold traditional Korean painting technique which uses powder pigments mixed with water glue (Agyo) on Korean paper (Hanji) in multiple layers. By means of an action research methodology, a series of my Bunche paintings’ processes were documented with digital photography and film, and reinvented as an independent video art piece which I call Documentation Art. This Documentation Art project challenges the conventional understanding of modern Korean Bunche painting in relation to the influence of Japanese Nihonga and Western abstract painting, and produces a new experimental potentiality, by means of interdisciplinary studies of Deleuze’s theory of art and the Korean art movement of Trueview (Jingyeong) realism. Throughout this research project, I explore how Deleuze’s process ontology and ‘virtuality’ give form to Documentation Art through ‘becoming’ and ‘desubjectification’ associated with transcendental time. Deleuze’s concept of the transcendental field of immanence, as a condition of real experience, radically recasts Plato’s Idea and subverts the notion of representation derived from Kantian transcendental aesthetic. This is the basis of the aesthetics of Transcendental Realism which integrates Deleuze’s ‘transcendental aesthetics of sensation’ with the aesthetics of ‘view from Tao’, based on Deleuze’s ontological position of the univocity of being. As a result, the Documentation Art is provisionally defined as Agencement machines, which operate by connecting different fields, and giving the connected assemblages entirely new sensesthrough the experimental process. In Deleuze’s aesthetics of Transcendental Realism, the Documentation Art project searches for the real in the deepest of Deleuze’s ontological layer, where transcendental time is encountered, underneath conceptual representation and interpretation."
