        "text": "This article provides an analysis of a public protest by the far-right group Pegida-Netherlands, where the participants attempted to demonstratively eat pork near a mosque in Eindhoven on 26 May 2019. This led to fierce responses: hundreds of young Muslim counter-protesters prevented the Pegida supporters from reaching the mosque, shouting insults at them and throwing stones at the police. Based on field notes from the event and a variety of other research material, this article shows how pork becomes a means of provocation in a larger entanglement between people and their perceived intentions, other objects, times and places. Furthermore, the author argues that the clash between protesters and counter-protesters can be seen as a theatrical performance set up by Pegida to share its worldview with a wide audience, and critically analyzes the role of pork in Pegida's attempt to 'reclaim Dutch territory' that has been 'lost to Islamization'. Last but not least, this article discusses how provocations bring about counter-provocations. As such, this article shows the value of a material approach to the study of conflicts, and critically evaluates Pegida-Netherlands' official stance of non-violence vis-à-vis the implications of its protest language.\n\nIn modern Iran and throughout their entire history, the majority of Persian Shiite visual arts in which one can observe the depiction of the Prophet Muhammad, his Ahl-i Beyt (Imam ‘Ali, Fatimah Zahra, Imam Hassan and Imam Hoseyn) and other saints are deeply connected to the folk narration (rivayat-i ‘amiyanih) and popular literature (adabiyat-i ‘amiyanih) of the history of the Iranian version of Twelver Shiism (Ithna‘ashari).[2] One of the main functions of these illustrations, which appeared for the first time in royal books (Gruber 2008) during the Timurid Dynasty (1370–1506) and were seen up to the Qajar period (1785–1925), in the popular Shiite lithograph books of the period (1785–1925), was to depict visually related religious events and stories. These series of illustrations (tasvirsazi) are mostly decorative (taz’ini) and function as a bridge between the text and the reader and, as far as we know, were never used as devotional devices.\n\nThis article analyses the short performances of Drag Sethlas at the yearly Gran Canaria Drag Queen Contest in Spain (2017–20) from the perspective of religious studies and gender studies, following on from an earlier article in which this case was explored in light of the severe blasphemy accusations (by local and national bishops and lay organisations) against the 2017 show. These short performances consist of remarkable representations of Roman Catholic texts, saints, symbols and rituals acted out as prize-winning drag-queen shows that were aired on national television. At the same time, these acts are situated, by reference to famous earlier controversial acts by the pop artists Madonna, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, in a genealogy of provocations and blasphemy accusations that are currently made in North American and Western European countries. In exploring the forms of ritualisation (cf. Bell 1989) in the provocation that this type of popular artistic performance with strong rel...\n\nMy argument in this paper departs from the suggestion that the winged creature that Eilish embodies is Lucifer, [originally] a biblical figure who is said in Isaiah 14:12-17 to have ‘’exalted his throne above the stars of God’’, intending to ‘’be like the most High’’. (...) This initial suggestion brings about two related questions: How, and, more importantly, why is Eilish employing text [lyrics] and imagery evoking this figure? This paper approaches these questions through the lens of the cultural and religious context(s) in which all the good girls go to hell was created. My aim is to explain why Eilish’ performance as Lucifer neatly fits the (counter-)cultural environment in which both the song and the music video originate. I do so by means of establishing an explicit connection between the literary construction of Lucifer as a romantic hero and the countercultural position of the [revolting] artist as genius. My argument is that Billie Eilish’ music video displays a performance of what I call expressive individualism (following Robert Bellah [1985] and Charles Taylor [2007]), an ideology that she subsequently embodies through the figure of Lucifer.\n\nConstructed between 1909 and 1912, the Elephant House is one of the highlights of Budapest Zoo, an iconic monument enjoyed by a significant number of visitors every day. However, Muslims living in Hungary at the time of its completion – including the Ottoman consul-general – raised concerns about its oft-noted resemblance to a mosque. Their criticism targeted the minaret-like tower in particular, initiating a dispute that led to the decision of its demolition in 1915. The peculiarity of this case emerges from the fact that although various earlier buildings, both in Hungary and elsewhere in Christian-majority Europe, had incorporated towers that imitated the forms of minarets, none of those seems to have sparked such an outcry. In addition, when the Elephant House underwent restorations in the 1990s, the tower’s reconstruction again raised more than a few eyebrows. Although the debate has partly faded away since, critical voices are occasionally heard still today. The apparent ‘minaret problem’ may thus give various food for thought, not to mention that the architectural language of this building has hitherto received inadequate scholarly attention.\n\nFor the entire In Conversation, see Patterns of Prejudice's \"A Conversation on Tariq Modood’s Essays on Secularism and Multiculturalism\", published in 2021: The four articles that make up this symposium on Tariq Modood's recent collection, Essays on Secularism and Multiculturalism (2019), are based on a public conversation and research colloquium held at Utrecht University on 18 February 2020. In the first article, Modood introduces the conversation with a statement of his thinking over two decades on the subjects of secularism and multiculturalism. This is followed by responses by Pooyan Tamimi Arab and Ernst van den Hemel and, in the fourth and final article, Modood has the last word."
