        "text": "For the first time since 2012 – the last time it was in a sensible time zone – I found myself attending the Summer Olympics. This time in Paris, not London, which made it the first holiday in a while where I only had to travel for half a day rather than spending all day messing around on trains. So I hopped on the TGV from Lausanne to Paris and arrived without problem at Gare de Lyon. I then encountered my first problem: my Olympics travel pass didn’t work. For reasons best known to the French, attending the Olympics required you to download three separate apps to your phone : a main Olympics one that I never actually used or looked at after initially opening it when I installed it , a tickets app to store your event tickets in, and a public transport app to do routefinding between destinations and buy your Olympics travel pass. If you actually wanted to buy said travel pass, you then had to download a further app to link in with Navigo, the ticketing system used in Greater Paris. So that’s four apps, which was a bit much. But you did want to buy the pass, because the French government in their omnibenevolence doubled the price of all the normal tickets during the games, so it was the cheapest option and also the most convenient as it was valid in all zones for however many days you bought it for. But it didn’t work, so I walked over to one of the helpful Olympics munchkins and explained the problem. He then took me over to the – lengthy – queue for the ticket office as they were the people to talk to. Whilst waiting, I looked through all the instructions for using the pass to make sure I hadn’t done anything wrong. Screen on. Tick. NFC on. Tick. Pass bought and apps installed. Tick. And then I found hidden away at the bottom of the purchase confirmation – in a manner somewhat reminiscent of being hidden in a locked filing cabinet in a stairless and lightless basement with a sign saying ‘Beware of the leopard’ on – ‘use phone screen up’. I had, of course, been holding my phone screen down. So I decided to have one last go at the ticket gates, because I’d barely moved in five minutes and only one other person had joined the queue, so I wasn’t losing much, and lo! it worked . Which meant I could actually get on the RER and head over to the Airbnb we’d rented for the five days we were there.\n\nYes, ‘we’, because of course I wasn’t going on holiday on my own – something I dislike intensely – and also because it’s the Olympics. It’s not really a solo thing. Though mostly as an excuse to see people in person. I was going to be joined by Adam, my friend from Barcelona who I’ve been round a decent chunk of Spain with by now, and John, Olivia and Airlangga, my former badminton team and current videogaming consortium. This did mean I was doing the potentially ill-advised thing of combining two different groups of friends into one, with all the potential for embarrassment and social awkwardness that creates, but I was fairly confident everyone would get on. I was, however, arriving first, which was probably for the best as I was the only one of the group who spoke French well, so it made sense for me to deal with our host. We’d booked a house in St Denis, to the north of Paris proper, and famous for being somewhat poor and violent. And also for being the burial place of over a millennium’s worth of French monarchs, more on which later. The reason we’d done so was that the events we were seeing – rugby sevens, field hockey and, of course, badminton, were all in the northern reaches of Greater Paris, so it made sense to be up there too. We’d booked it almost 18 months in advance, as soon as we had the tickets, which also meant it wasn’t horrendously expensive, despite having four bedrooms and plenty of space. I got to the address about 17:00 and was shown round by Sophie, our host. The house was, it’s fair to say, eclectic. If I say ‘old French jazz-musician couple with one child who’s also a jazz musician’ and you imagine the sort of house they’d have, it was that house. Lots of musical instruments, posters from various events and festivals, and objets d’art galore. So that was a bit different.\n\nAt this point, I had a couple of hours to wait before Team UK showed up – Adam wasn’t arriving until midnight, owing to the Barcelona-Paris TGV schedules – so I looked round the house a little bit, including exploring the music-studio basement that Sophie had mentioned but hadn’t been part of the tour. And while it was a basement with a music studio in, it was also very definitely a murder basement of the kind you usually see in a horror movie. I didn’t feel the need to go back down there again. Otherwise, I did a bit of planning for the coming week and waited for my friends to arrive. Which turned out to be three hours, because John’s travel pass also didn’t work, leading to them being stuck at Gare du Nord whilst trying to figure it all out. To be fair to the organisers, I think this was a case of user error, rather than app error, but it all got sorted out eventually, and then things were mostly OK on that front for the rest of the week. Though there always seemed to be one of us who’d have a minor problem at any given set of gates, so I reckon there was some underlying code jankiness going on.\n\nOnce John, Olivia and Airlangga had arrived and settled in, we headed over to the basilica – the nice bit of St Denis as Sophie had informed me – to get dinner, which we had at a brasserie. I had steak frites, thus hitting one of the main French food targets of my trip. We were also able to observe the general ambience of St Denis on the 10-minute walk over there, which I’d sum up as ‘a bit sketchy’. Lots of people just sort of randomly hanging around, though nothing too offputting. This may have been helped by what I can only describe as an overwhelming police presence: when I’d got out of the St Denis RER station, there had been three police cars and a load of officers standing around, and throughout the week, we saw plenty of municipal and national police, gendarmes and army soldiers stationed on trains, at stations, around venues, or just generally patrolling. The French were clearly taking it all very seriously. So a difficult couple of weeks for any petty criminals that might be tempted to go after some tourists. I think, generally, St Denis is mostly fine if you’re sensible, but probably not somewhere to wander around on your own after dark.\n\nWhen we got back, we put the TV on – the house had a very good AV system with a projector and some decent speakers – and, this being the evening of the 24th July, before anything had really got started Olympically speaking, we instead found ourselves watching The Last Sharknado whilst waiting for Adam to arrive. We missed the first half, and then I went and had a shower, so I can’t give it a fair review, but based on what I saw, ‘utter batshit’ would probably cover it. It was very bad, though amusingly so. Adam then turned up just after midnight, having had no ticket problems, so we were at last all present and correct, which we celebrated by immediately going to bed.\n\nWe did not rise early the following day – Thursday 25th – as we had nothing particular to do until our rugby sevens session at 14:00 and everyone was tired from travelling. Once we were ready to go, we headed over to the basilica, which is pretty much the only thing to actually see in St Denis. It’s a very fine Gothic church and, as I said, is where all the Capetian kings of France are buried, along with a decent chunk of the Merovingians and Carolingians. However, rather annoyingly, while you could have a look round the church, the museum-necropolis bit was ‘exceptionally closed’ for the 25th and 26th, because of stuff to do with the opening ceremony. Unfortunately, those were the only two days we’d have the opportunity to visit, which meant I did not get to see it. Adam managed to go on the final morning, as he had a late flight to catch, and said it was pretty decent, so I’ll make sure I go next time I’m in Paris. The basilica itself was worth seeing, too, at least. But this did leave us with a good couple of hours to kill before the rugby, so we looked round the nearby park and then went to Carrefour to pick up some provisions for lunch and breakfast. And then it was rugby time: this was being held in the Stade de France, the main national stadium, also conveniently located in St Denis , so we walked over to find the other 80,000-odd people also going there. It’s a big stadium. Getting in was very smooth – the Olympic tickets app was not as prone to malfunctions as the public-transport one – and we found our seats without trouble. Conveniently, for it was a very sunny day, we were nicely shaded by the stadium roof in what were nominally our worst seats of the trip – for badminton and hockey, we had category A seats, here we were only category B – but they were still very good. We were behind and a little off to the side of one of the goals, towards the front of the middle tier of seats, so we had a very good view of everything going on. We saw six matches, including a very close Ireland-New-Zealand tie, France losing, and Japan getting absolutely kerbstomped by South Africa, and had a lot of fun. The stadium was probably 80% full, so the atmosphere was good too. Adam found his colleague Ed, who was coincidentally also around, and all six of us went for a drink afterwards. Ed departed, and we had dinner at the place next door to the one from the previous night: this time I had magret de canard, another key French dish.\n\nThe Friday, the 26th, we chilled. We had no event tickets for that day and pretty much every cultural thing we wanted to see was shut because of the opening ceremony. The one thing we – John, Olivia, Airlangga and me – did was go play badminton for an hour very near to where the actual Olympic badminton was happening on some bookable courts Airlangga had found. Adam, meanwhile, headed off to hang out with Ed and watch the opening ceremony in central Paris. I am pleased to report that, unlike when they visited Lausanne, this time no one ended up with a racquet in their face, no blood was shed, and everyone was OK. I was also pleased that my rib – broken nearly 3 months previously – gave me no particular trouble, as this was the first time since then I’d dared to do something really strenuous. We even achieved a moderate degree of competence on occasion. The four of us then went back to the house to cook dinner – masterminded by Airlangga – and watch the opening ceremony. We’d been considering going to a fan zone or similar to watch it, but the rather damp weather forecast combined with the good AV and a general inertia once we’d got home and showered, meant we watched it in the house. Given the subsequent weather, this was definitely the right choice. So, we enjoyed the opening ceremony over a very tasty meatball bolognese. I will however say that ‘bucatini grande’ is the least practical pasta to eat in the world – it’s long, but also very thick, so you can’t suck it up like spaghetti or fettucine, but it’s also impractical to consume any other way.\n\nThis means it’s time to talk about the opening ceremony: overall, the group feeling was that it was very French, really playing up to a lot of stereotypes – threesome, anyone? – but also just very bizarrely French. We generally enjoyed the first couple of hours, but it felt as if it went on a bit too long with lots of what we collectively felt could be described as loading screens with some pretty artwork to keep you entertained while the main event was being prepared. We thought the guy on the mechanical horse coming up the river was cool, for instance, but he just kept going and going. Five minutes of him was cool, fifteen was too much. Our favourite bit was Gojira, the metal band, and we were all very confused by the naked Smurf version of Dionysus . Overall, perhaps, we felt there were a lot of good ideas in there, but the execution was lacking for some of them. And none of us understood why Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams, and Celine Dion were involved because none of them are remotely French? OK, sure, Celine Dion speaks French, but she’s Canadian: it would be like the UK claiming Bruce Springsteen was British because he speaks English. It just felt a bit of a weird choice. And we were all really disappointed that Ezzio – as we decided the masked guy with the torch who clearly had dropped in from an Assassin’s Creed game was called – wasn’t dramatically revealed to be, say, Macron or Zidane or anyone at all. And where on earth were Daft Punk? All that lightshow on the Eiffel Tower and they didn’t pop up on the balcony? Missed opportunity there. Using the river was also interestingly different, but it reduced the acts performing to (river)sideshows, which detracted from the spectacle a bit. Don’t get me wrong: on balance, we enjoyed it, but don’t think it counts as an unalloyed success.\n\nThe 27th, we had an early start to get over to the hockey stadium for 10:00 – the advice was to arrive 90 minutes before a session started, which we’d done for the rugby to test whether it was necessary, and decided it really wasn’t, so we were happy with 30-60 minutes beforehand – which took the best part of an hour, meaning we had to leave the house before 08:30. The hockey was at the Yves-du-Manoir stadium to the northwest of central Paris, which was the only venue that had been used in 1924, the last time Paris held the Olympics, when it was the scene of the opening ceremony and several events, so that was quite fun. We saw two men’s matches: GB vs Spain and Netherlands vs South Africa. As it turned out, this meant we saw the top two teams in the world at the moment – Netherlands and GB – and there was some very good hockey. We were also very happy GB won 4-0, and developed a minor obsession with one of the players, Gareth Furlong, because we thought his name was very silly . The weather was also perfect, as we were sitting in an uncovered stand: completely grey skies with some occasional light rain.\n\nWhen our session was over, we headed into central Paris – via a cafe where we got to witness the traditional Parisian pastime of beating up drunks – to visit the Sainte-Chapelle – also very enjoyably gothic, though disappointingly the Crown of Thorns isn’t on display there whilst Notre Dame is still being rebuilt – and then the Catacombs. The Catacombs are the product of centuries of uncontrolled quarrying for limestone under the city, followed by 150 years of engineering from the mid-18th century onwards to stop the city collapsing into the resulting maze of tunnels. And also 150 years of clearing out overfilled graveyards and stashing the bones in the newly available space. The visit takes you down to tunnel level with an audioguide, and then through a section of tunnels, bones and all. There’s some exposition at the start about the site’s history, and further audioguide stations and information panels throughout. It’s very good and very different – Rome is probably the only other city with a comparable feature – and also really rather spooky. I was definitely a bit freaked out by the time I got out the other side, though the others maybe less so. And it was a bit sobering to see how keen the staff were to check that we hadn’t stolen any bones – seemingly, lots of people indulge in a bit of graverobbing. Very much worth a visit, overall. I then abandoned everyone for the evening to meet up with one of my friends from Grenoble who now lived in Paris, and ticked off the third main French food group by having a big sausage of actual meat. The others tried to acquire steak frites, but were daunted by a long queue, and went instead to a Lebanese place down the road, before heading back to the house. I arrived back a bit later, towards 23:00.\n\nWhich was a bit unfortunate, because the following day, the 28th, our last full day in Paris, we had the badminton at the terribly early time of 08:30 at the end of a 45-minute journey, so we had to be out of the house by 07:15. This was collectively the one we enjoyed most of our three sporting occasions: the arena was very nice and comfortable – being indoors helped there on what was a hot and sunny morning – and it was easily the best value for money in terms of total amount of sport seen. We were near the front of the stand, just above one of the end courts – there were three in total – which meant we had an excellent view of one court, a good view of the central one, and an OK view of the other end court. And, for the next three hours, there was always at least one match going on at any given time across men’s and women’s singles, and men’s, women’s and mixed doubles. We lucked out that the one GB match – a men’s doubles against the top Chinese seeds – was on ‘our’ court, as such, which, even though GB lost, was very good, going to three games . It was a bit of a shame the Chinese mostly won – no upsets there – and there were also some very one-sided singles matches, but there was almost always one very good match on one of the three courts, so we were never bored. The large contingent of French fans just cheering for random underdogs also really built the atmosphere.\n\nOnce we were out, we again went into central Paris, had some very nice crepes for lunch – another key French food group – and then hit up the Louvre. We did try to get into the Tuileries to kill some time before our scheduled slot, but it was taken over by Olympics stuff and was practically inaccessible, so we didn’t. Once we got into the palace itself, we all dispersed to do our own thing, agreeing to recongregate a couple of hours later, just before closing time. On my previous visit, I’d done the top two floors of the Richelieu wing , along with some of the top two floors of Sully, so this time I finished the job and did the ground floor of Richelieu and half of Sully. This was because this was where all the ancient Near- and Middle-Eastern collections were and, as I was currently reading a history of Assyria, I was in the mood for some colossal winged bulls and cylinder seals. Additional commentary is in the photos, but I had a good time, though I was definitely ready to leave a couple of hours later. Much as I like the British Museum – and it possibly has a better set of Assyrian bas-reliefs and sculpture – the Louvre does make it look rather pokey. Upon leaving, we immediately went for dinner at a nearby brasserie, where I managed to have the only major French food left: seafood, in the form of some delicious spicy squid. We then went back to the house to pack and chill.\n\nThe following morning – the 29th – John, Olivia and Airlangga had an early start to get their Eurostar, so had to leave by 07:30. Adam and I had a more relaxed morning, not needing to leave till the checkout time of 10:00, and spending the time clearing the house up a bit. I also popped over to the nearest pharmacy, because, while I’d managed to not break any bones this time, I had picked up a rather nasty ear infection that was very painful and also making me half-deaf. I should have done something about it earlier, but didn’t. I got some ear drops, though, and I’m relieved to say that, after spending most of the week hopped up on painkillers, I’m now pretty much cured. As a result, though, it wasn’t the most comfortable train journey I’ve ever had back to Lausanne. Adam, meanwhile, as I mentioned a long time ago, had enough time to properly visit the basilica and then get a flight from Paris Beauvais, the London Luton of Paris. Apparently it wasn’t as bad as he’d feared. And there ends the tale: we’d all very much enjoyed our Olympic experience and I’d been right that everyone would get on. Personally, I really appreciated being able to see my friends and I’d certainly consider getting Olympic tickets again, next time it’s somewhere close enough to make it a sensible thing to do.\n\nFor the first time in a few years, I’ve sat down to re-read Tolkien’s works and, as I was making my way through The Silmarillion, I noticed something rather odd:\n\n‘Fingolfin and Fingon his son held Hithlum, and the most part of Fingolfin’s folk dwelt in Mithrim about the shores of the great lake; to Fingon was assigned Dor-lómin’\n\n– The Silmarillion, Ch. 14\n\n‘Now Hador Lórindol, son of Hathol, son of Magor, son of Malach Aradan, entered the household of Fingolfin in his youth, and was loved by the King. Fingolfin therefore gave to him the lordship of Dor-lómin’\n\n– The Silmarillion, Ch. 18\n\nIf we take these two statements at face value, they seem to directly contradict each other. When the Noldor arrive in Beleriand, Fingon is made responsible for Dor-lómin by his father, the High King of the Noldor at this point, which we can assume easily enough, I’d argue, meant Fingon was the lord of the region. Then, a few hundred years later, Fingolfin declares Hador to be lord of Dor-lómin. To put this into some sort of modern context, this would be a bit like if Chaz the Great and Mighty suddenly turned round and told William that he was giving the title of Prince of Wales to some random parvenu from, for the sake of argument and rhyme, darkest Peru. I mean, sure, he’s the king, he can do that, but it would create one hell of a stink and William would be at the very least rather put out. Fingon, however, registers no objection – at least none that is recorded – which seems odd for a prince of the Noldor, a proud race at the best of times, especially given Fingon is earlier described as ‘bold and fiery of heart’. This is not an Elf that is likely to take this sort of treatment lying down, to say the least.\n\nSo what’s going on? We can immediately discount any sort of authorial slip in the statement about Hador for Fingolfin instead of Fingon: Hador, as a 60-year-old, predeceases Fingolfin in the Dagor Bragollach (only by a few days), so Tolkien definitely meant to write Fingolfin. Nor, for the reasons outlined above, can we blithely accept that Fingon was completely disinherited and was totally OK with this. The key, I think, is in this passage, almost immediately preceding the one about Hador above:\n\n‘But after a time the Elf-kings, seeing that it was not good for Elves and Men to dwell mingled together without order, and that Men needed lords of their own kind, set regions apart where Men could live their own lives, and appointed chieftains to hold these lands freely.’\n\n– The Silmarillion, Ch. 18\n\nClearly, we’re meant to assume that Dor-lómin had been designated as a Human Settlement Region and to see Hador’s elevation to lordship in the context of that. OK, fair enough. But then, this poses a further problem: why Dor-lómin and, if Dor-lómin, what was Fingon doing? To deal with the first part first, the other two Houses of the Edain (the people of Bëor and the Haladin) end up settled in what might be reasonably called marginal regions. The people of Beör settle down in Ladros, part of Dorthonion, which is in the territory of Angrod and Aegnor. We are told earlier that Dorthonion is ‘barren’ and that the people of Angrod and Aegnor are ‘few’, so we can assume that making space for a few thousand humans is hardly a big deal. Also, let’s be honest, Angrod and Aegnor are very much supporting characters in the House of Finwë , so even if they’re not best-pleased – there’s no reason to think this, but let’s assume they were for the sake of argument – the A-listers can overrule them. The Haladin, meanwhile, end up in Brethil, which Thingol claims, but is outside the Girdle of Melian, which means his claim to it is about as effectual as the British claim to the USA. So after a bit of a sulk and Finrod telling him to stop being an eejit , the Haladin are allowed to settle there. Presumably, there are a few Sindar who are a bit narked, but, again, they’re easily overruled and the Noldor bigwigs are certainly not going to care – they mostly think Thingol, let alone any other Sinda, is an irrelevance . In both cases, we have regions being allocated to Men that are very much not core Elvish lands and which the Noldorin leadership are not overly bothered about. But Dor-lómin is neither of these things: it’s core, presumably relatively densely populated Noldorin territory – though we do know that most of Fingolfin’s people live around Lake Mithrim – and Fingon is the heir apparent to the king, so is not someone you can just fob off. Now, clearly, Tolkien wanted it such that Fingolfin and Fingon had ‘their’ pet House of the Edain, just as Finrod and his brothers had Bëor’s house, and there’s not anywhere else in Hithlum – the territory of Fingolfin and Fingon – that would obviously suit. But, right next door you have Nevrast, which at this point is totally empty because Turgon and all his subjects have buggered off to Gondolin centuries ago. A perfect place to stick a load of Men and still close enough to easily support Hithlum, you’d think?\n\nSo it is perhaps not entirely obvious why Dor-lómin was picked for the House of Hador to shack up in. But, even if we accept there is some reason, what is Fingon doing instead? He only has Dor-lómin, and now that’s chocka with Men under their own chief, so what’s he filling his time with? None of the other Princes of the Noldor are disinherited in this way – Angrod and Aegnor lose a bit of land, but not their whole lordship, and Thingol has to give up some land he doesn’t really control anyway – so why does Fingon, probably the biggest dog of the three in real power terms, draw the short straw? As it turns out, Fingolfin gets offed in the Bragollach a few years later and Fingon becomes High King, so he’s not unemployed, as it were, for long, but no one on the Eldarin side could have foreseen that at the time the decision was made. It’s all very odd and I don’t know how to explain it. We’re at the end of the long period of peace between the Dagors Aglareb and Bragollach, so it’s not as if he’s off on a side-quest or anything: pretty much, everyone’s just chilling out and wondering when the other shoe is going to drop. Does Fingon actively shadow his dad and learn something about Practical Kinging? Seems unlikely, given he’s very much grown up, a competent ruler in his own right, lives next door anyway, and that there’s no indication this ever happened among the Noldor or Elves more generally. Presumably, he just mooches around Eithel Sirion, which seems to have been where him and dad hung out most of the time anyway, training horse archers on Ard-galen or something, but it just does seem as if this is a loose end Tolkien nor Christopher never properly tidied up.\n\nWhich leaves us with a bit of a poser: Dor-lómin is an odd choice for human settlement in the first place when there’s a literally empty bit of nice habitable territory right next to it, and the former Lord of Dor-lómin, the Noldorin Crown Prince, now has no territory and is not offered anything in recompense. But, as the narrative stands, both of these things have to be accepted. So, for once, I have no clever solution, but if anyone thinks of one, do let me know !\n\nLa Sarraz\n\nThis castle is 10 minutes from where I live and yet I only found out about it when someone at work casually mentioned it on the assumption I’d already been there[1]. It’s also on the European Cultural Heritage register, which ranks it a notch above the average castle. La Sarraz is unusual, because it was passed down in the hands of (various branches of) and lived in by the same very extended family from its initial construction in 1049 until 1948, when the widow of the last owner died, and the castle became fully a museum owned by the trust he had set up[2]. As such, it’s definitely got a more lived-in feel than a lot of castles, and the mish-mash of restorations and renovations over the years makes it part stately home and part defensive structure. Two of the (slightly trimmed) original towers remains, but the curtain walls were knocked down in the 18th century, with the very last defensive remnants making it to the 19th century, and the interiors of the buildings are presented in a range of decors covering the 16th-20th centuries. So there’s a lot of variety to see!\n\nTo rewind to the beginning, the castle was originally built by the de Grandson family as it overlooks a strategic narrow defile on the main medieval route between France and Italy. A cadet branch of the family held it until 1269, when it passed through marriage of a surviving daughter to the Montferrand (now Montferrand-La Sarraz) family, who stuck around until 1505 (surviving the Burgundian Wars when the castle was set on fire and subsequently substantially rebuilt), when the last member, Barthelemy II, died and left two wills: one passing the castle to his cousin, one to his nephew, who was still a minor. After some amount of argie-bargie, the castle being set on fire again, and general disputatiousness, this mess was resolved in 1541 when the nephew died and his widow married the nephew of the cousin, causing the castle to pass to the de Gingins family. This was a Protestant noble family that, unusually, managed to keep its position and wealth after the Bernese invaded in 1536 and that eventually managed to gain entry to the Bernese patricianate. The castle remained in the family, lived in by successive members and relatives, many of whom were frequently away being mercenaries, until the last member died in 1902, after which it passed to a nephew who was the last owner mentioned above.\n\nAll this is retraced in the permanent exhibition in the castle – which is all new and fancy with an interactive keycard in a way that’s quite well done – as it takes you through the rooms and you get to see artefacts and interiors from throughout the castle’s history. It’s quite interesting and also taught me something surprisingly new: the Swiss did do colonialism. I’d always been under the impression that, while individual Swiss nationals got involved in colonial enterprises of other countries as soldiers, merchants and administrators, there had never been any state-sponsored official colonial projects. But, there sort of was. One[3]. In 1853, Napoleon III gave a company based in Geneva[4] 20,000 hectares of land in the Kabylie region of Algeria at Setif, on which the company proceeded to set up the only official Swiss colonial venture, only finally folding in 1958. One of the de Gingins was the administrator for a period, hence why this was mentioned in the castle, but this is clearly something the Swiss don’t like to talk about or is just obscure. I’d never even seen it hinted at anywhere else. So there we go: the Swiss Empire briefly was a thing, though not much of a thing.\n\nThe castle grounds, in the former stable block, also host the Horse Museum. Thematically appropriate, if nothing else. This is a separate venture to the castle itself and requires a separate ticket – there’s a combi-ticket available – and is an older-school museum. There’s a lot of horse paraphernalia, bits on equid evolution, sections on all the various uses humanity has put horses to, all scattered around in no particular order. It’s moderately interesting, but no more than that, unless you actually care about horses. I got round it in 20 minutes and didn’t feel as if I’d missed anything I was at all interested in.\n\nChillon\n\nChillon is possibly one of the best-known castles in Switzerland, sitting just outside Montreux at the eastern end of Lake Geneva on the way from Lausanne to the mountains, and therefore bang on the tourist and day-tripper trail. It certainly has a spectacular setting, built on an islet just offshore, framed against the Dents du Midi as you approach it from the north. The fact it’s built on an islet also means it’s a different shape to all the other Savoyard castles of Vaud: a sort of pointy ellipse, rather than the square form the Savoyards built everywhere else. So there’s a reason it’s well-known.\n\nI have been to Chillon before, on a family holiday nearly 15 years ago, hence why I took a while to get round to seeing it, despite it being only 45 minutes away by train. I can’t say I remembered anything much from said holiday, though, so I was effectively going round the castle for the first time. This intent was slightly hampered by me going on a Sunday in early December, however: the weather was absolutely perfect – cold, sunny, with snowy mountains all around – and I had consequently reckoned on people being keen on a day out, but what I hadn’t anticipated was that the castle would, of course, be doing a load of family-oriented Christmas activities, so was overrun with screaming children. Fortunately, they were mostly confined to the courtyards and specific rooms, so once I’d fought my way in, following the well-signposted route through the various bits of the castle wasn’t quite the scrum I’d feared.\n\nThe route takes you round all the courtyards and castle buildings, in the process giving you a thorough grounding in the relevant history and plenty of spectacular views of the lake and mountains. The earliest parts of the castle date to the 11th century, though the majority of the building is 13th-century with some later additions[5], and, as with the case for most of Vaud’s Savoyard castles, is largely the brainchild of Peter II of Savoy. As the 7th of 8 brothers, not a man who was lined up to be Count of Savoy, but who proved a very adept one when chance nobbled his older brothers and any nephews, to the point that he was called ‘the little Charlemagne’, which one feels is perhaps a little overdoing it, given Savoy wasn’t that big. But, he did introduce a load of administrative reforms, based on English models picked up while he was merely a younger brother hanging around in the court of Henry III of England (who married one of Peter’s nieces, Eleanor of Provence), and was the count most responsible for the medieval power of Savoy. A ruler of some import, in other words, and the man who really spotted Chillon’s strategic potential, sitting slap-bang across the Via Francigena, the main trade route over the Simplon Pass between France and Italy in the Middle Ages. The castle itself was also notably never taken by siege until the Bernese conquest of Vaud in 1536, owing to its formidable natural defences. It was also the last castle in Vaud to fall to the Bernese. The castle isn’t just a pretty face, let’s put it like that, and very much worth a visit, though I might suggest not going in the run-up to Christmas on a weekend….\n\nOne other point to note is that opposite the castle, dug into the cliff-face on the far side of the road and railway, is the fort of Chillon, the 19th-century strongpoint constructed to control the modern infrastructure. This is also a museum, seemingly very up-to-date and whizzy, based on their website, and aimed at families, with advance booking recommended. Given the hordes of kiddies milling around, and the fact I hadn’t booked, I didn’t attempt to visit on this occasion, but I may try to go back and see what it’s like at some point in the future. There is also, of course, Montreux itself, three minutes away by train, which, when the Christmas market isn’t on, is quite a nice place to wander around, especially if you like Freddie Mercury and/or gambling. Chillon is therefore somewhere you could comfortably spend a day.\n\n[1] It is perhaps true that I have a reputation for being the historico-cultural attractions person. I don’t know why.\n\n[2] It’s use as a family museum with some rooms open to the public dates to 1911, but Helene de Mandrot, the widow of Henri, continued living in the castle until her death, and using it as a location to host artists. It’s because of her activities – at some point, basically everyone who was anyone in the European art world of the interwar years seems to have been a guest; Eisenstein, for instance, even shot a short film in the castle, now lost – that the castle is on the European Cultural Heritage register.\n\n[3] Subsequent use of Google seems to suggest this number should be revised to three: there was also an official Swiss colony in the late-19th century in El Salvador, mainly because coffee, and another one in Morocco. Strictly speaking, none of these were state-sanctioned – the federal government never got involved – but one imagines there was some level of cantonal support, which puts them into the state ballpark. They seem to have been driven by business interests who tried to piggyback on other countries’ full-on colonialism. Morally, it’s unclear if this is better or worse.\n\n[4] One of whose founders was none other than Henri Dunant, who would go on to found the Red Cross.\n\n[5] And, of course, there’s the usual story of heavy restoration from the 19th century onwards after the castle had been turned into a prison and left somewhat derelict by the government. However, almost uniquely in the Francophone world, Eugene Viollet-le-Duc does not seem to have been involved at any point in its restoration. I did not think this was possible.\n\nIn what was possibly my last exploratory weekend in Switzerland – there might be one more, there might not – I elected to go to Biel/Bienne, the only officially bilingual town in the country[1]. Bienne – I’ll stick with the French version of the name, because that’s the one I know better[2] – lies on the eastern end of the lake of the same name, the easternmost of the three lakes – Neuchatel, Morat and Bienne – that make up the Swiss Seeland at the foot of the Jura mountains. Despite frequently passing through the town on my way on the train to points eastward, I’d never considered stopping because, frankly, the general impression I got from people was that it was a bit of a dump with nothing much to see.\n\nAnd this is somewhat true: Bienne is probably the least picturesque town I’ve been to in Switzerland. The Jura are a decent-enough backdrop, but the town itself leaves quite a lot to be desired, lacking any of the usual accoutrements of Swiss towns – no walls, no quaint old town, no big Rathaus, nothing – and generally feeling slightly run-down. This is by Swiss standards, admittedly, so not actually dilapidated or anything, but definitely less des-res than other places I’ve been. You might justifiably thus be wondering why on earth I finally decided to visit after nearly two years of ignoring the place. Partly, the answer is that I’ve basically run out of anything bigger than a very small town to visit within a two-hour radius and I wanted to do something. But mostly, it’s because Bienne – well, technically Nidau, the town immediately abutting it to the south – is the place where the museum – in Nidau castle – on the correction of the waters of the Jura is housed[3]. I’d seen references to this in various other museums and exhibitions throughout northwestern Switzerland, and had gleaned that it was some sort of big engineering project that had been undertaken in the region to control the lake levels, but I’d never found out much more about it. So I was quite keen to finally visit something that explained what had actually happened.\n\nThe castle – as far as I can tell, pretty much another default Savoyard square from the late 13th century – is a five-minute walk from Bienne station and, as well as hosting the museum, houses the local prefecture. It’s free to enter and my impression is that not many people do – I was in there for a good hour on a Saturday morning and no one else appeared – which is a shame, because it was really interesting. Whilst reading the next bit, by the way, refer to the two maps I’ve stolen off French Wikipedia below and which are much more legible than my photos of the exhibition maps, because otherwise, nothing will make sense. The general thrust of what happened is this: after the ice had retreated following the Last Glacial Maximum ~21,000 years ago, the whole area, from Solothurn (Soleure on the maps below) in the east all the way to the Orbe in the west (quite a long way off the western edge of this map) was covered by Lake Solothurn, which drained catastrophically through a breached glacial moraine dam in prehistory, leaving the three current lakes of Neuchatel, Morat and Bienne behind with their attendant rivers. Downstream of Aarberg, the hydrological gradient on the Aar becomes very slight, so sediment deposition on the plain led to it switching between flowing westward into Lake Bienne or eastward in the course depicted on the maps. But everything was basically fine throughout the Roman period and into the high medieval period. From the 14th century onwards, though, the climate got colder and wetter, and the whole region (highlighted in blue on the second map) became prone to devastating floods every few years. The result was the formation of Le Grand Marais – the Great Swamp – in the triangle between Bienne, Aarberg and Soleure, and the loss of valuable agricultural lands, impoverishing the whole region, a situation made worse by constantly having to rebuild after each flood. In a very literal sense, the whole place became a rural backwater that everyone left as soon as they could. The fundamental problem was that, the whole region being so flat, small changes in land and water levels could radically alter flow regimes. Typically, what happened was that high water levels in the Aar caused by snowmelt and/or rainfall led to the Thielle running backwards into Lake Bienne, because the Aar was now uphill, leading to the lake level rapidly rising, which then led to the upper Thielle also reversing to flow into Lake Neuchatel and then the Broye reversing into Lake Morat, turning the whole region into a big puddle. This is analogous to what happens today on the Mekong, which at high water levels flows into the lake of Tonle Sap. This was all made worse by the particularly tortuous route the Aar took around Büren and the presence of a big sediment ridge restricting the Aar’s downstream flow around the inflow of the Emme, just past Solothurn.\n\nTherefore, from the 17th century onwards, there was a general feeling that someone should really do something about all of this, because everyone was fed up of dying of floods, malaria and malnutrition. But nothing happened, despite various schemes, both sensible and crackpot, being proposed. Nothing, in fact, continued to happen for 200 years. This was not due to a lack of means or ability – the 17th century saw the Fens in England being largely regulated and drained by Dutch engineers, as well as the construction of the Canal du Midi in France. And the Dutch had, of course, been messing around with this sort of engineering for centuries already – but due to politics. The affected area covered five cantons – Vaud, Bern, Neuchatel, Fribourg and Solothurn – and despite all being nominally friends, they weren’t terribly motivated to work together to pony up the quite large sum of cash that was needed, because, well, this was someone else’s problem, with that someone else mostly being a load of poor peasants without much political sway. So it wasn’t until 1848 and the founding of the Swiss Confederation in its modern form, such that there was actually a meaningful central government, that anything started to be seriously likely to happen. The fact that the issue was on the government’s radar at all was largely due to the work of one man – Johann Rudolf Schneider – a local doctor who held various cantonal and federal governmental posts from the 1820s through to the 1870s and pretty much refused to stop agitating. But, even then, the confederation took 20 years to do anything[4], meaning that the first correction des eaux du Jura was only completed in 1868, leading to the situation in the map below.\n\nPretty much, the Broye and both the Upper and Lower Thielle were canalised to allow the water to flow faster. The Aar was diverted to flow into Lake Bienne, thus removing the bottleneck upstream of Büren, and dams were built to regulate the whole thing. The result was the Great Swamp turned back into very productive arable land – it supplies something like a quarter of Swiss fruit and vegetables to this day – and a reduction of a few metres in the water levels of the lakes, back to near what they were before the 14th century. Which led to a veritable smorgasbord of archaeological sites suddenly being uncovered, though, as this was the 19th century, there was rather more looting by excited peasants than actual archaeology that happened, which was a bit unfortunate.\n\nThis all worked very well until about 1944 when there was a really big flood that overwhelmed the infrastructure, followed by several more floods in the 50s, made worse because the peaty soils had subsided as they dried out over the last century. Consequently, the second correction des eaux du Jura was undertaken between 1962 and 1973 – the Swiss again not being overly hasty – which mostly consisted of deepening and widening the existing canals, building a better dam at Nidau to control the overall outflow – this had actually happened in 1939, but wasn’t enough on its own – restoring the meanders on the Aar between Büren and Solothurn to stop the banks eroding like billy-o, and finally removing the sedimentary constriction at the inflow of the Emme. That’s been the setup for the last 50 years, all regulated from a fancy control centre in Bern, and it seems to work for the moment.\n\nSo that’s what it was all about. Quite an impressive amount of hydrological engineering. Though they were also very keen to point out in the museum that they cared about nature and had made it sustainable and so on, which I’m sure was a great relief to all the spirits of all the frogs who used to live in the Great Swamp. I mean, yes, it’s obviously important to try to reduce the environmental impacts of these sorts of schemes and take opportunities to make them more nature-friendly where you can, but don’t go pretending that what amounts to wholesale dredging and digging a lot of very big holes is in some way good for the environment. People did it to benefit people first and foremost. But, definitely a very worthwhile exhibition to visit, particularly as it’s free! After some lunch, I also popped in to the New Museum Bienne – it’s unclear what the Old one was – which was a pretty standard Swiss provincial museum. Some moderately crap local art, a lot of very granular detail about the local area, and a reconstruction of a historical dwelling. The main thing I picked up was that the reasons for Biel/Bienne’s bilingualism was 19th-century immigration. Historically, the town was very much German-speaking, but then a load of French and Italian speakers arrived in the 19th century to work in the watchmaking industry[5] and turned it bilingual. Otherwise, I browsed through quickly, and headed back to the station. I avoided the local art gallery, because my experience of Swiss provincial art galleries is that they’re usually quite bad and I couldn’t see any reason this one wouldn’t be, and fought my way through the city-centre crowds – there was some sort of annual local festival on that had turned the city centre into a market-cum-fairground, which rather slowed me down. I’m not sure I can particularly recommend Bienne as somewhere to visit in general, but in the very specific case of hydrological engineering, it’s definitely worth it.\n\nThe moral of this story is possibly that localism is great provided all you have to deal with is local issues, but more likely is that you just shouldn’t live in a swamp.\n\n[1] I think people outside Switzerland sort of tend to assume that everyone in Switzerland speaks four languages and lives in some sort of international cosmopolitan merry-go-round. Actually, the language border is pretty fixed, very few of the French speakers speak German, very few of the German speakers speak French, no one outside Ticino and the Italian border speaks Italian, and the three people who speak Romansch don’t leave their valley. Most (younger) people do speak English pretty well though.\n\n[2] The name was actually the same – Bielna – in both languages until about the 11th century, then French dropped the -l- and German the -n-. The name itself is ultimately Celtic, deriving from Belenos, a Celtic war god.\n\n[3] I’m literally translating the French correction des eaux du Jura here. A more natural way of putting it in English would probably be ‘regulation of the Jura lakes’ or similar.\n\n[4] By Swiss standards, this is quite quick.\n\n[5] At no point did the museum explain why there was a watchmaking industry in the town. There was a lot of very dull detail about random factories, Swiss labour laws and so on, but nothing on what to me seemed the obvious why question that I actually wanted to know the answer to.\n\nMore films. More thoughts. There are just always more films.\n\nJoker\n\nOr Send Off The Clowns. I am going to start by saying that Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as the eponymous psychotic clown is, undoubtedly, very good. This does not save what is otherwise a pretty derivative film, in that it’s a mash-up of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, but somehow less interesting than either of them, because it turns out that trying to do two films’ worth of sociopathic character arc in the space of one film doesn’t work so well. And, as The Lego Batman Movie correctly pointed out, the Joker without Batman is a bit lost. It is an interesting exploration of what happens to someone who falls through the gaps and just wants to make people laugh, but both of those angles have been better explored by Robert de Niro before. And, boy, is it bleak.\n\nSnowball rating: 2.5/5\n\nTotal Recall\n\nOr The Great Oxygenation Event On Triple Speed. The original, with Arnie, not the remake with Colin Farrell. This is certainly a cut above the default Arnie movie, in that in addition to the expected gratuitous violence, corny one-liners and token female characters, there’s an actual plot that’s thought-provoking and keeps you guessing. Because it’s based on a Philip K. Dick novel rather than Boys’ Own Magazine. Arnie comes dangerously close to having to act on occasion too. But, within the above-mentioned limitations set by it being a 90s action film starring Arnie, this is about as good as it gets.\n\nSnowball rating: 5/5\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\n\nOr Plot? We Don’t Need Plot Where We’re Going! I knew most of the cultural references from the film, but I’d never actually seen it, so I thought I should rectify that. I see immediately why it’s a cult classic. I also see why audiences normally watch it drunk. Because, frankly, it’s not a very good film. Nothing makes any sense and stuff just happens for no rhyme nor reason. I get this isn’t the point of the film, but it is very much something you want to watch in a group all of whom are several sheets to the wind, and not sober with one other friend. Tim Curry is clearly enjoying himself immensely, however, and the song-and-dance numbers are fun.\n\nSnowball rating: 2/5 (sober); 4.5/5 (drunk)\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part 1\n\nOr The Cruise Of A Lifetime. The latest in the long-running action saga sees Tom Cruise pretending he’s a much younger man, and, frankly, pulling it off. So he’s a bit puffier about the face and there’s a suggestion that the hair’s not jet-black any more, but he’s still doing all the stunts and, boy, are they impressive. The action just keeps coming, and is interrupted only by some genuinely funny lines and some genuinely touching emotional bits. The cast work well together and it didn’t feel anywhere near as long as it’s 2h 43 minutes running time would suggest. An extremely accomplished action film. Even if one could say that Tom moves on quicker than Thrust SSC.\n\nSnowball rating: 5/5\n\nMortal Engines\n\nOr Mad Trax: Juvie Road. After the near-perfection of the trilogy of The Lord Of The Rings and the subsequent series of unfortunate events that was The Hobbit trilogy, Peter Jackson turned his attention to Phillip Reeves’s young-adult SFF series. I did read the books, but a very very long time ago, and, beyond the basic premise of municipal Darwinism – still one of the best phrases invented by any author – I couldn’t remember much. But, I think this may be the one occasion PJ should have made a longer film (OK, OK, he’s not actually the director, but he was definitely the driving force): I remember the books being compelling, but the film, while looking very nice, reduces it all into two hours of screentime and thus ends up being Mad Max for kiddies with a bit of Han and Leia thrown in for good measure. Hugo Weaving is great fun as the baddy, though. Solidly fine, but no more than that.\n\nSnowball rating: 3/5\n\nOppenheimer\n\nOr How I Learned To Start Worrying And Hate The Bomb. Christopher Nolan’s unsurprisingly non-linear biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the Manhattan Project, is certainly a cinematic tour de force. I felt genuinely tense at several points, and the soundtrack and visual effects really keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole three hours. The portrayal of Oppenheimer himself is nuanced and lets you make up your own mind about him and, with an all-star cast, the acting is uniformly superb, even if the female characters are a bit wasted. However, it does feel long, especially once you get past the Trinity test, and it’s very much focused on Oppenheimer himself, as you might expect, so other major figures, such as Fermi, can get some degree of short shrift. It’s also, fundamentally, a political-legal thriller more than anything else, so don’t watch it thinking you’re going to learn much about science.\n\nSnowball rating: 4/5\n\nSpiderman: Into the Spiderverse\n\nOr Peter Parker Picked A Peck Of Pickled Peters. Much as with the most recent MCU outing for the Boy In The Spidey pyjamas (which this pre-dates), and in a similar style to the Lego Batman Movie, it turns out Spiderman is a lot better when you play off all of the various versions of the character, rather than trying to create yet another definitive one. The animation is fun and I was a particular fan of Film Noir Spiderman (voiced by, I was surprised to discover, Nicholas Cage), and the whole thing passed very enjoyably, despite being, fundamentally, the same Spiderman story I’ve seen three (now four) times in movie franchises in my lifetime. Which says something about the energy, emotional depth and gags of the film. The only slight drawback is that the first half hour or so, before all the interdimensionality gets going, feels a little dull because it is the same starting point as every other (first) Spiderman movie, even if the main character has a different name.\n\nSnowball rating: 4/5\n\nThe Lego Batman Movie\n\nOr No Batman Is An Island. Following on from the above, I wanted to rewatch the best of the Batman movies. It manages to cram a load of references to all the previous exploits of the Caped Crusader, a genuinely good plot, comic timing and emotional beats into its 1h 44 minutes running time, which is something of a tour de force. You can’t not have fun whilst watching it. If you’re not familiar with the other Batman films, I suspect it loses a little something as an adult, but I think you’d still be entertained.\n\nSnowball rating: 4.5/5\n\nDas Boot\n\nOr Sleepless in Sea Battles. This film has the reputation of being one of the most consummate war movies ever made, but I’d never got round to watching it, what with the runtime being a somewhat daunting 3 h 30 minutes. I finally made myself sit down and watch it, however, and, well, it deserves its reputation. Once the crew get on that submarine, it’s unremittingly tense until the very very end. Even though you’re watching what most people would consider to be the Bad Guys and you should therefore be rooting for them to be blown out of the water, you somehow don’t. Also, I never ever want to go on a submarine now. I can’t say it was high up my list of priorities, but now I really don’t.\n\nSnowball rating: 5/5\n\nThe Continental\n\nOr Mel Gibson’s Apochotello. Now, this is not strictly a movie. It’s a three-part mini-series, but each episode is 90 minutes long, so I think it just about qualifies. The series is a prequel to the John Wick films, giving the backstory to how Winston (a lot taller as a young man) and Charon (a lot shorter as a young man) ended up managing the New York Continental hotel. I’m not sure the movies needed this, I’m not sure I needed this; in both cases because the films are not really majoring on plot as their USP. It’s moderately entertaining and Mel Gibson is a splendid choice as the psychotic baddie because he can just play himself, but it’s nowhere near as good as the films it’s trying to ape because half or more of the runtime does not involve anyone doing gun-fu, which is what the movies do so well. Still, when it does stop doing plot and gets to some action, it’s pretty good.\n\nSnowball rating: 3/5\n\nIn the second week of June, I found myself on holiday once more, this time not precisely going anywhere new, but heading back to the UK, principally to attend the wedding of Emma and Alan, two of my friends from my time as an undergraduate at Cambridge. Alan is Scottish and Emma is from the Lake District, with the wedding being held in the latter location at the church at which Emma used to sing as a child and teenager. Specifically, in the Eden Valley in the northeast corner of the Lakes. Which gave me the opportunity to take the train from Switzerland to the northwestmost bit of England in one day. A somewhat long day, unsurprisingly, but one free of any transport issues, thankfully. Beyond the unfortunate presence of some aggressively drunk Scots on the train from London up to Penrith, the relevant Lakeland stop[1].\n\nGiven there was a group of us from undergraduate all going to the wedding, we’d rented a big cottage in the vicinity of the venue, to which I made it late on the Friday, having left home at 07:00 that morning. We all passed a convivial evening and then turned in fairly early as the wedding was the following day. Saturday morning was a sort of weird dead zone where we had loads of time – the ceremony wasn’t till 13:00 – but none of us needed remotely that long to get ready. I did, however, have to drive a manual-transmission car for the first time in about 4 years – my parents now have an electric car where gears are not something the driver need concern themselves with – to drop a couple of us off early at the church, as they were singing in the choir[2], in one of my friends’ cars[3]. I may have bunny hopped on the clutch a bit, and underestimated the width of the car on the narrow roads a couple of times, but I only stalled once and no damage beyond a bit of muddiness was sustained, which I call a win. Eventually, the waiting was over, and we piled into the taxi we’d booked to take us to the church in Morland. It turned out to be a very nice church: it has the oldest tower in northwest England – it’s Saxon – and was all in all very pretty. Possibly I spent more time looking at the church than at the things one is supposed to observe in a wedding ceremony. The service passed off without a hitch, it was all very joyful and everyone had a good singsong. Though the sermon was a little odd: if I were to sacrilegiously sum it up, it would be 1) the Trinity is really simple, which is not so much burying the lead as dumping it into long-term geological storage, and 2) the Song of Solomon – phwoarrrr – amirite??? – which isn’t strictly wrong, just not something the church – or the Church of England, at least – likes to admit usually, as they tend to find it a bit embarrassing. But, hey, it was entertaining.\n\nThen we retired to the grounds of the local country pile, immediately adjacent to the churchyard, and proceeded to have the reception-cum-garden-party. All very English and only spoiled by the fact that, despite it staying dry and mostly sunny, the temperature topped out at about 11 degrees. Even in northern England, that’s a bit on the chilly side for June. Dinner was in a marquee in the garden, during which I began to regret not wearing a jumper with my suit, but the food was very good and I even spoke to someone on my table I didn’t already know, which is something I try to avoid at all costs usually. Dinner was followed by a ceilidh, which I sat out, partly because of my strong aversion to participating in public dancing, but mainly because I still wasn’t fully healed in the rib department after my misadventure in Madrid, and wasn’t about to risk aggravating it by doing something I didn’t really want to do anyway. Consequently, I got the earlier of the two taxis we’d booked back, along with my pregnant friend, and ended up in bed at a pretty sensible time. Clearly, I needed it, because I slept through the others all coming back a couple of hours later and getting the whisky out in the kitchen.\n\nSunday featured an organised post-wedding walk, to which about 30 of the guests turned up. It was consequently a rather slow walk up one of the local wainwrights[4] – High Pike, in the Skiddaw massif – but it again stayed dry, though the wind was something fierce, especially on the peak itself. We did have some fun on the drive over, as there was a big hole in the road at one point – especially adverse camber, as I called it – that required some careful driving to get around. We then headed back to the cottage and vegged out for the rest of the afternoon, until we went to the pub over the road for dinner. The Monday, we then all went to Lowther Castle, just round the corner: it’s a big estate owned by the eponymous family, with some very pretty grounds. The castle – actually, a big country house following 18th and 19th-century remodellings – is largely a ruin, as the interiors were taken out by the then-Earl in the 1950s, and the shell and estate were largely left to their own devices for several decades. The ruin has now been mostly stabilised, with a café in the stable block and a short exhibition on the history of the family and estate in another renovated part, and the grounds are about two-thirds of the way through a 20-year restoration project. They are still very nice to wander around, however, with some great views and lovely flowers. There’s also a very substantial children’s play area that we definitely didn’t spend an unreasonable amount of time in, there being no children on a school day, and the café does good food. It was then time for me to leave – we had the cottage for the whole week, and the others were all staying on, but I needed to go and visit some other friends and family.\n\nSo it was down to the southern end of the Lake District to visit my friend David in his new house in Ulverston – Tuesday was dedicated to another walk, this time up Pike-a-Blisco – before heading down to Sheffield to see my parents, sister and nephew, which was very pleasant. I left Sheffield on the Friday morning, spent the day in Cambridge seeing some more friends – mostly of the Tolkien sort – and then was in London Saturday. My main activity was to see the Michelangelo and Roman army exhibitions at the British Museum[5], and then to go play some board games with my friend Frederic and his partner, Clare, Souffff of the River. Sunday, it was then back to Switzerland, ready to be back in the office Monday. So, I fitted a lot in, but I spent at least two nights everywhere I stayed, so it wasn’t too bad. I do wish I’d been able to pass the whole week in the cottage in the Lake District, though! I should also note the weather remained unseasonably cold throughout: for once, I was quite looking forward to heading back to something a bit warmer and sunnier in Switzerland! But, a good holiday: hopefully, future visits should be less rushed, as I’ll be able to be a bit more flexible with my time once I start my new job in Germany.\n\n[1] If I were feeling unkind, I might suggest this is identical with Scottish people generally. But, given some of the other Scottish passengers told them to shut up, this would have to be very unkind.\n\n[2] A salient fact here is that Emma studied Music and so did several of the group. As someone with barely a hemidemisemiquaver of musical ability myself, I’ve never quite worked out how I ended up with so many musical friends.\n\n[3] Another salient fact is that, what with us all having become or having already been liberal metropolitan elites, only a couple of us could actually drive, so I was the best option to drop the one person who actually does drive a lot off at the church.\n\n[4] Wainwrights are the peaks in the Lake District that have elevations of 1000 feet – 330ish metres – or higher. There are a couple of hundred of them, all numbered, and you can try to do all of them. I must have done 20 or 30 so far, I think. The name comes from the man – AJ Wainwright – who published a series of guides in the 60s to the Lake District, giving all his favourite routes to ascend all of them.\n\n[5] Both good, as far as they went. The Michelangelo one focused on the last 30 years of his life, when he was contracting out work to other artists – he’d do the sketch and then they’d do the painting – and really showed the transition to Baroque art in the latter half of the 16th century, as well as just how many pies Angel Mike had his fingers in. There was some very good art – principally Michelangelo’s sketches – but I feel they missed out on a key salient point, which is that Michelangelo was famously crotchety and, generally, a bit of a knob. I mean, he could afford to be, but the exhibition rather gave the impression he wasn’t, which painted a somewhat false portrait of the man. The Roman army exhibition, while not telling me anything I didn’t already know, was very well done, being organised around the life of Claudius Terentianus, a real legionary recruit whose letters home have survived, and using that to explore all the different facets of army life in the Roman world. There was also a strong offering for kids, based on following Claudius Terattus, a cartoon rat, which worked really well. The one thing that was knew/I didn’t believe was that, for the kids, they had a height chart, with 172 cm (the minimum height for legionary recruits) marked on it, as well as various other things. This chart topped out at 240 cm, with the legend ‘Tallest Roman ever: Maximinus Thrax’. Now, good old Thracian Max, one of the first of the third-century soldier-emperors, was canonically a big guy, but he was also one of the prime contenders for Person Most Hated By All Available Sources In The Third Century, so there was a certain tendency to overplay his monstrousness for rhetorical effect. Moreover, once I looked it up afterwards, the 240 cm figure is from the Historia Augusta, which is essentially a work of fiction more interested in ‘orrible murders and sensationalism than sober reality. It should therefore be taken with a whole wagonload of salt. So I’m a little surprised the BM used it. I suppose it doesn’t matter for kids, but still.\n\nI spent another weekend visiting my friends Claire and Matthias and their two toddlers, Anna and Marta, recently. This making a large chunk of Switzerland that I hadn’t previously been to considerably more accessible, I convinced everyone that what they wanted to do on the Saturday was visit Schwyz, capital of the canton of, uh, Schwyz, one of the three OG Swiss cantons all the way back to about 1300[1]. This also means I have now visited – as in stayed the night and/or visited an attraction within – 15 of the 26 cantons[2]. This is likely to be my final tally on leaving Switzerland, unless I make it to something in Jura, which is the only one of the 11 remaining cantons that is an easy day-trip from Vaud – Basel-Landschaft, Obwalden and Nidwalden are all at the outer limit of my 3-hour-train-travel-time threshold for a day trip, but I’m not sure I can really be bothered. This may also be the case for Jura, because there’s not much there, apart from walking, which requires more organisation. But still, 60% of the country isn’t a bad endpoint to finish on.\n\nSchwyz itself is a bucolic Mitteleuropean town near, though not on the shores of, two different lakes and surrounded by mountains, of which the two most prominent are the twin Mythen peaks (the ‘y’ is pronounced like the ‘u’ in French ‘lune’). We’re not quite talking full-on Alps here, but still decent-sized mountains. In many ways, it is the picture-postcard image of Switzerland everyone has in their minds reified. The weather was verging on the damp and cloudy, however, so we were only treated to intermittent, partial views of most of the local terrain. Not that we were really here for that: my chief object was visiting the third branch of the Swiss National Museum – the other two being in Prangins and Zürich – and the Bundesbrief museum, which charts the foundation and formation of Switzerland through the charters between the various cantons. I will also note here that, in canton Schwyz, as in much of Switzerland, history stopped round about 1500 – it’s a rural, Catholic canton – hence its continued tweeness.\n\nThe Swiss National Museum – this branch focuses very much on the history of the founding and consolidation of the country – was perfectly fine. It was up-to-date, there were plenty of things for the toddlers to do, and some interesting things for the adults to look at. But it’s all pitched at a very high level for the person with very little knowledge. I can’t say I learned anything hugely new, let’s put it like that. As a side note: entry to one branch of the Swiss National Museum allows you to get into the others for free if you go in the next week. This may be useful if you’re a tourist travelling across Switzerland, but was not an offer I was able to make any use of yet again, because I’d already been to the other two.\n\nWhat I found more interesting was the Bundesbrief Museum – we’d gone for some lunch beforehand, and I’d left my friends to do some shopping while I indulged my own proclivities, so I was wandering around this one on my own. Now, this is a museum fundamentally about charters and treaties, so nearly all the exhibits are bits of parchment with variously illegible handwriting on them, so it is not perhaps the most visually arresting museum to visit. But it is quite interesting. What the museum chiefly deals with is the hagiography surrounding the foundational elements of Switzerland: the 1291 Federal Charter, the Rütli Oath of 1307, William Tell, and the Battle of Morgarten in 1315. It then proceeds to deconstruct said hagiography and explain why it exists.\n\nThe narrative of the founding of Switzerland derives almost entirely from two sources: the 1470 White Book of Sarnen and the 1570 Chronicon Helveticum of the 16th-century chronicler Aegidius Tschüdi, who was from Glarus and largely based his account on the material in the White Book. Tschüdi confidently dated the beginnings of Swissness to when the three founding cantons – Schwyz, Uri and Unterwalden[3] – sent representatives – the one for Uri was Tell in some later depictions – to the Rütli meadow to swear an oath of mutual assistance and confederation in 1307. It is perhaps worth noting that no contemporary source records the event. He also dated the events of the William Tell legend to about the same time, which we know isn’t true, because it really is just a local version of a northern European legend. The Swiss Confederation was then cemented by victory over the Habsburg forces of Duke Leopold III at the Battle of Morgarten a few years later, a battle that is not overly well-represented in contemporary sources either. Not to the extent that Tschüdi made it up, but the consensus seems to be that he bigged up what was otherwise a fairly unremarkable small medieval battle. No one’s even entirely sure where the battle took place, beyond that it was somewhere near Schwyz, in and around the Lauerzerzee.\n\nOne thing Tschüdi makes no mention of is the 1291 Federal Charter, the document that is now considered to mark the first formal agreement between the three founding cantons, and that has pulled the Rütli Oath 16 years backwards in time, as well as defining Swiss National Day as the 1st August. This is because he didn’t know about it, or, if he did, didn’t think it worth mentioning. This was in fact true of basically everyone in the world for 450 years after the charter was written: the document was only (re-)discovered in the mid-18th century in an archive, and subsequently bigged up. Subsequent to this, historians have found a few mentions of the document in other records, but it seems fairly clear that no one at the time or for centuries afterwards placed any great import on it. There is also some controversy over whether it was actually written in 1291 and whether it describes something that actually happens. The parchment has been carbon-dated and is from about the right period, but that says nothing about the writing. It’s in a hand found on no other document, no place of signing is named, and it’s generally unusually vague. The most convincing theory put forward to explain this is that the charter was actually written in about 1309 by the local Imperial bigwig to demonstrate to the newly crowned Emperor Henry VII that he’d been doing a good job of keeping order in the region and should therefore definitely keep his job. And what better way to demonstrate that than to produce a charter between three of the major local powers, showing them being all chummy?\n\nSo, in one sense, the Federal Charter is possibly a near-contemporary forgery. In another sense, this doesn’t really matter, and the museum takes great pains to explain this. For a start, there are plenty of other similar agreements about the same time – before the discovery of the 1291 charter, the 1315 Pact of Brunnen between the same three cantons immediately following the Battle of Morgarten was regarded as the beginning of Switzerland – so exactly which one is the first one is something of a hair-splitting exercise. But people do like to celebrate anniversaries, and this is why the 1291 charter matters. In the 19th century, as the Swiss were trying to construct a modern nation-state, they realised that the usual markers of the nation couldn’t be relied upon: they had neither a language nor a religion in common. So they had to fall back on a shared national history of struggle against the oppressive Habsburgs in the name of peasant freedom. Which is why the symbolic value of the first treaty of association between the cantons, and the subsequent story of the oath and the battle really matter: they’re the Swiss founding myth and bind the country together. The reality of the Federal Charter is therefore almost entirely irrelevant besides its symbolic value. And 1st August is a nice time for a public holiday. The 1291 date also conveniently lines up very well with the 1191 founding of the city of Bern, so the Federal Council picked that particular charter as the one that marked the start of Switzerland. So, even if it’s not exactly from then, everyone believes it is and so it is. After all, there’s no solid proof it isn’t anyway, so if you want to believe it’s from 1291, sure, why not?\n\nIn other words, it was quite an interesting glimpse into the Swiss psyche and the process of nation-building in Switzerland. Not bad for 5 CHF. We subsequently did a short walk around the town centre to fully capture the bucolicity and then went home because toddlers. I think I can say Schwyz is definitely worth visiting, and there are plenty of nice walks to do as well in better weather and minus relcacitrant kiddies.\n\n[1] The lack of a precise date is a clue, dear reader, that there’s going to be some amount of explanation about a historical controversy in a couple of paragraphs.\n\n[2] For those keeping track, these 15 are, alphabetically, Aargau, Basel-Stadt, Bern, Fribourg, Genève, Luzern, Neuchâtel, Schwyz, Solothurn, St Gallen, Ticino, Valais, Vaud, Zug, Zürich. Leaving me with the two Appenzells, Basel-Landschaft, Glarus, Grisons, Jura, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Thurgau and Uri unvisited.\n\n[3] Now split into the demi-cantons of Obwalden and Nidwalden for reasons that date back to the late medieval period and no one seems entirely clear on.\n\nThis term, I’ve been teaching the third-year undergraduate course on Quaternary Environmental Change. This has mostly gone fine – my Cambridge-supervision-trained ability to waffle plausibly about almost anything, regardless of any (lack of) actual knowledge turned out to be once again useful. This is because, in my group, I’m probably the least qualified to teach anything on the Quaternary, as I’m the only person whose research is wholly contemporary with no palaeo-glaciological element. But hey, I was taught about it in the first year of my undergraduate degree[1] and my memory’s definitely that good. Definitely. Though I did also teach it in Cambridge, so I’m overstating quite how clueless about it I am.\n\nThe way the course is assessed is that the students, in groups of two to three, have to make a five-minute video about one of the topics covered in the course, in a sort-of pop-science style that would be accessible to the general public. The university has a whole video-filming-and-editing suite with a green screen and everything, which the students get some time in, so they have the possibility to make something really quite professional[2]. Now, in my heart, I will always believe that making students write an essay or sit a written exam is the only real way to properly assess them – that’s also a legacy of Cambridge and also a result of the fact that I was always very good at doing them – but I’m not unaware that there are problems with doing that and that it takes a lot of effort for you as the lecturer to organise and mark. ChatGPT also makes setting coursework-type essays a somewhat fraught venture at the moment and forever more. So I was quite interested to see how setting a video-based assessment worked. There’s no real way to stop them outsourcing the writing of the script to the chatbot, but they still have to put the time in on recording and formatting the resulting videos, so it’s difficult for them to totally circumvent the process.\n\nThe mark scheme is split 60-40 content-format. The students need to cover all the main points relevant to their chosen theme, say stuff that’s correct, provide appropriate references, not just rehash the lecture material, and generally speak clearly. They also need to have a sensible structure, good use of visuals – it’s a video, after all – no big sound quality or editing fails, and some degree of creativity.\n\nIt’s fair to say the results were mixed. There were six groups this year and no one failed. But there was quite a lot of meh. Four of the groups basically did what we might term ‘we filmed a presentation’: they had slides that they were standing in front of, reading out a script. A couple of them did this quite badly – standing in front of graph axes, not much of a structure, no real visual flair or engagement with their slides – and a couple did it really rather well[3]. What were more interesting were the two groups who’d really tried to use the freedom of the video format to do something a bit more creative. One group did an excellent video, with interesting visuals, superbly clear narration and professional-level production values that was only really let down by the fact that they’d chosen to present a particular method and then forgot to say anything about what the problems with said method were, so they lost a few marks on the science side. The other group did what was still essentially ‘we filmed a presentation’, but rather than appearing in the video themselves, they’d created a little animated man to fill that role, which was quite a fun take on the concept. The problem was the narration. The group had asked me whether the videos had to be done in French or if they could do it in English, and I’d said it didn’t matter: there’s nothing in the mark scheme specifically on the language, just that they need to communicate effectively, and, for a science video, English is perhaps a better choice than French anyway. And then I’d not thought any more about it. Until I played the video, when it turned out the underlying reason they’d been asking me whether this was OK was because they’d fed their script into a text-to-speech voice synthesiser. Now, synthesised voices have come a long way in the last 20 years, but the sort of ones that are freely available on the internet are still not the most, hm, natural-sounding. And this was one of those. It was monotonous. The stresses were all wrong. It sounded like Marvin the Paranoid Android when he was having an off day and lacking his usual joie de vivre.\n\nThis was deeply unfortunate, because it was otherwise a good video that would have got a very good mark. Personally, I was very tempted to flat out fail them for being lazy bastards, though, strictly speaking based on the mark scheme, I could only knock off the 10% for clarity of communication, which meant they still got a pass. I don’t even see how doing this saved them much effort: they’d written the script, done all the animations and slides, put it all together and everything. That’s the time-consuming bit: just reading the script out and adding it over the top as a soundtrack would have taken them another quarter of an hour, tops. So I’m rather puzzled: much as with the previous term’s numerical modelling exam, it’s not so much that they adopted a minimum-effort approach that bothers me, it’s that they did a really bad job of it. I can understand that some students are always not going to be very interested and just want to cruise through on low-effort mode, doing the minimum needed to pass, and, in a weird way, I can sort of respect that. But they put all the effort in to do a decent video and then skimped on the last little bit that was barely any extra effort at that point, nullifying all the work they’d already done. Which is just silly.\n\nAnyway, the last session of term was the film night, where we screened all the videos and got all the students to vote on a few awards: best picture, best actor, best animation, best voiceover, people’s choice. The results were…\n\n[1] This actually meant I was provided something of a contrast: this was a 10-week lecture course taught in third year, with 90 minutes per lecture. When I learnt it, we were taught in 8 weeks in one-hour lectures in first year and covered the first nine lectures of the course I’ve just taught, and did them in more detail. So, to be honest, my memory didn’t have to be that good.\n\n[2] When I said ‘mostly gone fine’ at the start, this was the bit where the wheels came off. The team in charge of the video suite had had some sort of reorganisation since the previous iteration of the course, so getting the recording slots for the students organised proved very hard for reasons I don’t understand and which were never explained. The upshot was that the recordings twice got cancelled at very short notice, the students got stressed and I was left looking like an utter chump.\n\n[3] In fact, the highest-marked group were in this category – maybe not the most original video format, but they gave an excellent presentation scientifically."
