        "text": "1879\n\nAlfred Hugh Harman begins making Gelatine Dry Plates in the basement of his house in Cranbrook Road, Ilford, Essex.\n\nHis business was named 'Britannia Works'. 1880 The business expands to houses purchased in Grove Terrace (later Uphall Road, Ilford). 1883 New factory built adjacent Grove Terrace on a site that would subsequently have the address of Roden Street (maybe called Roding Street at the time) and become the premises of Ilford, Ltd.\n\nIn 1883 Harman introduced the paddle steamer trade mark 1884 Introduction of Bromide & 'ALPHA' paper 1885 Introduction of 'ORDINARY' Plate (4.5ASA) 1886 Britannia Works is now Britannia Works Co.\n\nPrices of dry plates reduced to penalise the Marion plate company after a dispute with them.\n\nRenaming of products to 'Ilford' Dry Plates \"known prior to February 1886 as 'Britannia'.\" 1889\n\nSeptember 1889, a monthly news sheet was introduced called 'Photographic Scraps'. Harman's first business manager, whom he appointed in 1889, was John Howson, a salesman with quiet charm, great originality and considerable initiative. Immediately on joining, Howson started to write and publish Photographic Scraps (Ref: Silver by the Ton, p.112).\n\nDoug Mckee has copies from No.35, July 1893 to No.50, October 1893. He also has a copy dated March 1899. The July 1893 issue No.47 shown alongside has the foreword \"The monthly issue is now over 29,000 and copies can be had from photographic stock dealers throughout the world, from China to Peru. Any dealer who does not get a sufficient supply, should drop us a postcard stating his wants.\" By June 1908, the circulation had reached 40,000 monthly, see bottom of p8 of the pdf here. A web page devoted to 'Photographic Scraps', where copies can be downloaded as pdf files, is available by clicking here.\n\n\"Photographic Scraps\" ceased publication in 1914 and didn't restart after World War 1.\n\nIlford Alpha Lantern Plates, box image see here. 1890 'The Ilford Manual of Photography', originally 'The Manual of Photography', was first published in 1890. Mr C H Bothamley was the principal writer of the the Manual and it was published by the Britannia Works Co. (which became the Britannia Works Co., Limited in December 1891). The Ilford Manual of Photography continued in production to a 5th edition in 1958 (see below) which was reprinted eight times to 1968. Thereafter it was taken over by the Focal Press and its title reverted to simply \"The Manual of Photography\". The book reached its 10th Edition in 2011 published by Taylor & Francis (my thanks to Gavin Ritchie for this information)\n\nDespite the use of Ilford's name in the title of the earlier editions, it was not dedicated to describing the use of ilford equipment and chemicals, but was a generic description of how to use cameras, process film and make prints. 1891\n\nThe company (still privately owned) was registered as 'Britannia Works Co. Ltd' on 17th December. First Board Meeting was held on 2nd December.\n\nGeorge Eastman (of Kodak fame in the USA) first set up business in the UK in 1885, as the \"Eastman Photographic Materials Company, Limited\", a wholesale importing company. They began manufacturing photographic materials (film and printing papers) in Harrow, Middlesex, UK around mid-1891, becoming future competitors to the Britannia Works Co. and Ilford. Subsequently, \"Kodak, Limited\" was formed in November 1898 when they acquired the business of the Eastman Photographic Materials Company, Limited. Kodak's Managing Director was Mr.William H. Walker.\n\nIntroduction of Printing Out Paper; P.O.P., see here.\n\n1892\n\nIn 'Photographic Scraps' for 1st August 1892, there is an announcement of 'The ILFORD Year Book, Diary, and Register of Exposures'.\n\n\"Full particulars, specimen pages, and woodcut next month; 180 pages, bound in French morocco, 1/-. The issue for 1893 (must have been the first issue) will be ready on 1st November next (i.e.1892), and it is proposed to make it an annual volume. To ensure prompt publication it is now in the printer's hands, and export orders will be executed on and after the 1st October next.\"\n\nRon May owns an 1895 copy of 'The ILFORD Year Book' (the title seems to have been abbreviated since the 1892 announcement, above) and has provided scans of its cover and a few of its 180 pages. To view these, click here.\n\nPage 169 announces that 32,000 copies of 'The Ilford Manual of Photography' had been sold by the time this 1895 Year Book had been published (around November 1894).\n\n1895\n\nIntroduction of 'EMPRESS' (9ASA) Plates, see here.\n\nIntroduction of SPECIAL RAPID (13ASA) Plates, see here.\n\nIntroduction of PROCESS (0.55ASA) Plates.\n\n1897\n\nIntroduction of 'CHROMATIC' Plate (4.5ASA)\n\nIn 1897 and again in 1903, Eastman Kodak approached the company with a view to a take-over or an amalgamation, but nothing came of these proposals.\n\nBromide Platinomatt Surface paper  (PMS paper) introduced. See packet cover image alongside, courtesy of Michael Talbert. See here.\n\n1898 10th March; meeting to discuss going public.\n\n17th May; first Board meeting of The Britannia Works Co.(1898), Ltd.\n\n7th June; Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held. A vote re: 'Going Public' was put to shareholders and 'carried'.\n\n19th July; The name of The Britannia Works Company (1898), Limited changed to The Britannia Works Company, Limited\n\nThe reference to 1898 in the company title was soon dropped (Companies House shows 10th August 1898; my thanks to Gavin Ritchie for this information).\n\n14th Sept; the (private) company 'Britannia Works Co.Ltd ceased to exist and the (public) 'Britannia Works Co.(1898) Ltd. came into being with a nominal share capital of £380,000.\n\nAlfred Harman (then aged 50) retired from active control of the company at that time but continued to provide his expertise and experience for several more years. 1899 Platona printing paper introduced. Still in production in 1908. See pdf of a Platona instruction leaflet here.\n\nA Platona 'ILFORD Platinum Paper' tin, used by the Britannia Works Co. Ltd, Iford, London, for the supply of Platona paper around 1899. This tin measure some 170mm in length and 65mm diameter. The lid has an air tight seal ring which seals against the body of the tin when the lid is securely screwed on. The paper has to retain a trace of moisture in order for the development process to work, so presumably the air-tight lid prevented the paper from completely drying out. To see closer views of this tin, plus a smaller tin (in better condition), click on the image alongside or here. 1900 In October, the company made representations to change their name to Ilford Ltd, but the Ilford Urban District Council objected.\n\nThe Ilford Urban District Council finally approved the name change from Britannia Works Co. Ltd. to 'Ilford Ltd' provided there was a comma inserted after the name 'Ilford' and Ltd was spelt in full i.e. Ilford, Limited.\n\n(The change of name to Ilford, Limited was finally registered on 24th December 1900; my thanks to Gavin Ritchie for this information).\n\nThe comma continued in use, officially at least, until 1951 (maybe there was a 50year agreement with the Council?) but in practice it was dropped from advertising literature around 1935 (possibly the result of the area becoming the 'Municipal Borough of Ilford' in 1933 ?). (Ref: D.M) 1901\n\nA box of Ilford Special Lantern Plates, photographed by Rab Egerton.\n\nClick here, or on the image to see an enlarged view.\n\nThe box is marked H1 = August 1901. 1902\n\nIlford market their first camera, the Falling Plate magazine cut film camera (though records suggest it was in the process of being commercialised from 1899). This quarter plate magazine 'box' camera was advertised as able to be loaded in less than a minute with sufficient cut film to take 40 exposures before reloading. Ilford manufactured their own special film with a cardboard backing. The illustrated camera is within the collection of the National Museum of Science & Industry, Bradford & London, inventory number 1976-537 (now the National Media Museum).\n\nThe 1903 & 1904 BJPA gives the price of the camera as £5 with the Bausch & Lomb Rapid Rectilinear f8 lens in Unicum Shutter (T,B, 1-1/100s; as in the NMSI collection) or £8.8s (£8.40p) for the Ross Symmetric Anastigmat lens in Lopa Shutter. Ilford Special Rapid Films, in boxes of 20, cost 3s/4d (16.5p) postage extra. A camera price of £5 is equivalent to around £620 in 2020 money, based upon a comparison from this site (thanks to Gavin Ritchie) http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1633409/Historic-inflation-calculator-value-money-changed-1900.html\n\n1903 Ilford 'MONARCH' Plate (3.5ASA ~ or maybe 35ASA as is stated in \"Silver by the Ton\" for Monarch Flat Film introduced in 1906). 1907 Ilford X-Ray Plate 1908\n\nThe 'Photographic Scraps' monthly news sheet (now \"post free for 12 months for 6d\" - 2.5p) which started in August 1889 (see above) was still in circulation and had reached a monthly circulation of 40,000, see bottom half of p8 of the pdf here. It finally ceased publication in 1914.\n\nSee pdf here for a 1908 (F.8) leaflet that includes Platona, Bromide paper & rolls of the time, Plates & films, Kalona self-toning paper, GasLight paper, P.O.P, Bromona & announcement of the 205th thousandth Ilford Manual of Photography.\n\n1912 Ilford 'KING'S OWN' Plate (20ASA) 1913 Alfred Hugh Harman died in the 2nd quarter of 1913. The death was registered in the district of Hambledon (which spans the boundaries of the counties of Surrey and Sussex) and appears in the General Register Office (GRO) Index as Page 211, Volume 2a. 1914-18 Information from Harman Technology, emailed to me by Brett Killington, is that the following 19 Ilford employees lost their lives serving their country during the 1st World War.\n\n\"Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn\".\n\nH.G.Bailey; T.Bell ; H.W.Bones; W.W.J.Christmas; J.

The scan of the instructions was emailed by \"David\".\n\n\"Imperial Handbook for 1919\", produced by The Imperial Plate Co. Ltd, Cricklewood, London, NW2.\n\nScanned and sent by Paul Godfrey. To see the booklet as a PDF file, click the image or here. A small part of the overall text is written on the inside of the front and back, red, covers and is difficult to read, but can be deciphered by zooming the PDF image to around 200%.\n\nImperial was already under Ilford Limited influence by 1919, and was possibly already owned by Ilford Ltd. (see the chronology 1928-1930 'slot' below). Paul tells me, based upon information from the book \"Silver By The Ton\" (see text under 'Ilford Chronology' above), that Imperial produced one of these books each year until 1927. However, Richard W Holzman has e-mailed (March 2020) with the news that he has acquired a collection of Imperial Handbooks spanning 1914-1934 (though missing the 1915 & 1922 issue). The 1934 issue was the 40th edition and (despite the 1927 date in Silver by the Ton) this edition is believed to actually be the last. Since this was the 40th edition, the publication must have spanned 1894-1934. Content relating to Selo roll films increased 'year on year' in the 1930s until, by 1934, all the adverts related to roll film.\n\nRichard's guess is that by 1935 Imperial Plates had been discontinued. The complete 1934 edition can be viewed as a pdf, here. My thanks to Richard W Holzman for providing this.\n\nThe 'Foreword' explains \"our aim in producing this booklet year after year is to demonstrate the wide applications of amateur photography and to suggest to users of our products the best means by which to get the maximum benefit from them\".\n\nTo view the covers of the 1907 and 1910 issues, click here.\n\n1920 - 21\n\nThe 'Selo' company was formed with the purpose of carrying out the joint R&D and sensitising of roll films, for all of the companies now falling under the Ilford company \"umbrella\". Ilford at this time imported its film base material, first from the Celluloid Corporation (USA) and later from Gevaert (Belgium).\n\nSelo was initially formed by an amalgamated group consisting of Ilford, Imperial and Gem plus (in 1928) a consortium of four other UK manufacturers that had originally (in 1921) combined (with three others) under the name of APM (Amalgamated Photograhic Manufacturers Ltd; London).\n\nAPM was formed in 1921 (as APM 1921) and at that time consisted of the seven British companies, viz: Kershaw Optical Co Ltd; A Kershaw & Son Ltd; Marion & Foulgar Ltd; Rotary Photographic Co Ltd; Rajar Ltd; Paget Prize Plate Co. Ltd. and Marion & Co Ltd. In 1928, four of these seven i.e.Rotary Photographic Co Ltd; Rajar Ltd; Paget Prize Plate Co. Ltd and Marion & Co. Ltd, all being the ones who made sensitised materials, became APeM Ltd (Amalgamated Photographic Equipment Manufacturers) and subsequently became part of Ilford, Ltd (though Rotary had already joined with Rajar in 1917).\n\nThe remaining three i.e. Kershaw Optical Co Ltd, A Kershaw & Son Ltd and Marion & Foulgar Ltd, then became Kershaw-Soho Ltd. They later became part of the J Arthur Rank Organisation.\n\nSelo films were sold by these companies under their own labels. The 'Selo' company was situated in Woodman Road, Warley, Brentwood, Essex. Although the name 'Selo' was officially dropped in 1946 (see below) the Brentwood factory continued to be known as 'The Selo Factory' until it was sold and the site subsequently levelled in the early 1980s.\n\nSharon Ellis has sent me a picture showing her Great Uncle, James Charles Emberson, as a member of a 'gang' of workers constructing (or extending) the Selo Factory in May 1921.\n\nBelow that picture is another sent by Sharon, of Selo employees in the 1960s and, especially, Sydney Bourdon, the father of a friend of Sharon.\n\nWhat is the derivation of the name 'Selo' ?? No one seems to know. Could it stand for 'Sensitised Celluloid' film? Or maybe it just refers to its purpose to 'Sensitise Roll Films'.\n\n1923\n\nFirst appearance of Ilford Iso-Zenith plates, speed 700 HD originally = around 50ASA (ISO) in the post-1960 speed rating system.\n\nThe text on this box label gives formulae and development times for recommended ID-2 Metol-Hydroquinone (M.Q) and ID-11 M.Q Borax developers. Also, there is a formula for the recommended fixing bath.\n\nBUT, the illustrated label is dated July 1938 (G38). Ian Grant (October 2020) has e-mailed to me a copy of an Iso-Zenith label from October 1930 (J30), and there is no mention of ID-2 or ID-11. This leads to consideration of when Ilford's ID-11 developer first became available.\n\nEdwin Garcia (in May 2009) pointed out that Kodak's D-76 and Ilford's ID-11 are identical formulations, and that D-76 was devised by a gentleman named Capstaff in 1926. Ian Grant has supplied a link, which suggests that D-76 was originally a motion picture developer and appeared at a slightly later date than Edwin Garcia mentions, perhaps 1927-28.\n\nIan Grant tells me that Kodak's D-76 formula began with a body of research based upon the Wellington Fine Grain M.Q. Borax developer, as appears in the 1922 Wellington Photographic Hand Book, though may well have been available much earlier. Kodak's own research eventually led them to D-76. By the time Wellington & Ward (W&W) were taken over by Ilford around 1930, Wellington was aged 71 & his brother-in-law Ward was probably of similar age. Wellington had been a manager within Kodak for a short time before setting up W&W in 1895.\n\nA February 1934 booklet \"Ilford Plates and Films\" (see below) has no mention of the ID-11 formula, and doesn't use the ID naming system. On the other hand, a January 1937 booklet entitled \"Ilford Book of Formulae\" (see below) does use the ID naming system and provides the formulae for both ID-2 and ID-11. Hence it seems the ID naming system was introduced between 1934 and the end of 1936. The 1934 booklet states an identical formula to ID-2, but refers to it as simply Metol-Hydroquinone. Since there is no equivalent ID-11 formula in the 1934 booklet, it seems neither ID-11, nor any developer of that formulation, was recommended by Ilford until sometime post-1934, confirming that Kodak's D-76 pre-dates ID-11 by at least 7 years.\n\nFurther information from Ian Grant is that Kodak eventually published their D-76 formula, and it became the basis of not only ID-11 but also Dupont/Defender 6, M&B 320, Forte FD20, Foma FV5, Agfa 19 and Gevaert 206.\n\nIlford Cinematograph Film first distributed. 1924 Ilford 'UNIVERSAL' Film.\n\nIn June, George Herbert Leigh Mallory of Mobberley, Cheshire (subsequently home to ILFORD Imaging UK and now ILFORD Photo), and Andrew \"Sandy\" Irvine, set out to conquer Everest. Both men were lost and it remains a mystery whether they reached the summit. 1928 First attempt at manufacturing a subtractive type of negative-positive colour 'tri-pak' roll film in conjunction with a small concern called Colour Snaps (1928) Ltd. The film was called Colorsnap film. The process proved difficult and was wound up in 1930.\n\nIntroduction of Ilford Soft Graduation Panchromatic Plates, 28ASA - would have been 56ASA in 1960 revision - reflected in the plates having an Ilford speed rating Group E.

The exact chronology and commercial details are somewhat obscure and the following should only be taken as a simplified guide to events.\n\nIlford acquired the Mobberley site (owned by Rajar Ltd since 1903), in the take-over of the various companies within the Selo organisation formed in 1920. APM, a part of Selo from 1921, was split and a new organisation formed, called APeM (Amalgamated Photographic Equipment Manufacturers ). APeM subsequently (maybe by 1929) became part of Ilford, consisting of Rotary Photographic Co Ltd; Rajar Ltd; Paget Prize Plate Co. Ltd (see picture, courtesy of John Wyllie), and Marion & Co Ltd. The other part of APM (camera manufacturers Kershaw Optical Co Ltd; A Kershaw & Son Ltd. and Marion & Foulgar Ltd) became Soho Ltd.\n\nA history of the Paget Prize Plate Co.Ltd, taken from the book 'Silver by the Ton', can be downloaded here.\n\nWellington & Ward (based at Elstree, near London) joined Ilford by 1930. Ilford had already (by 1920) some commercial involvement with other old-established UK photographic businesses, viz: The Imperial Dry Plate Co.Ltd; Thomas Illingworth & Co.Ltd and The Gem Dry Plate Co.Ltd, but possibly the merger with APeM lead to Ilford exercising more direct control over all these previously small independents.

The best brains of the companies concerned became at once concentrated in the research and production of one company's products, with the result that many important new products were produced and improvements effected in various existing grades\".\n\nTo download, view and read this supplement, click here.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1939 Ilford acquired directly or through subsidiaries some dozen businesses engaged in the manufacture of photographic goods of various descriptions. During the 1930s a number of distribution centres were set up in different parts of the country and factories or branches were established in five European countries and in India and Australia.\n\nDuring the next 30 years, Ilford's Mobberley site began to concentrate on the manufacture of photographic paper. The large rolls of paper were transported to the Essex factory for cutting, packing and distribution.\n\n1929-30\n\nThis 8-page leaflet of Ilford products has been extracted from the 1930 BJPA Almanac. Although dated 1930, the Almanac has information on goods and events from the previous year, so represents products from Ilford that were on sale in 1929 (see footnote). Click here, or the image, to download the leaflet as a pdf file. Made available by David Muggleton.\n\nInterestingly, there is no mention of Selo products at this time. Ilford roll film is still named, simply, Ilford Roll Film, speed H&D350 suitable for \"Snapshots, all subjects all weathers.\" The H&D350 speed is equivalent to around 25ASA (ISO) on the post-1960 rating basis.\n\nThe marketing name Selo, for roll films, must have first appeared in 1930 (for confirmation, see below).\n\n1930\n\nThe first commercial release of Selo roll film, and the Selo Soldier, has been traced to the 8th April 1930, via an advertisement in The Chemist and Druggist magazine for 29th March 1930; see here for the advertisement page in the The Chemist and Druggist, or click on the image shown alongside.\n\nAddressing town centre chemists, who were the predominant source of photographic goods to the amateur photographer in the 1930s, Ilford encouraged them to apply for advertising material to display in their shop windows and (presumably) for stocks of the new 'Fast' Selo film.\n\n\"The SELO soldier will 'Fire his First Shot' on April 8th. It will be one of great power and range - a whole page announcement in the Daily Mail. Issue your orders now! Be certain that you will have the 'SELO' soldier saluting in your windows when the great campaign opens\".\n\nBy being a joint product of previously independent film suppliers viz: IMPERIAL, ILFORD, ILLINGWORTH, RAJAR (Apem, Ltd.), GEM and WELLINGTON, the single SELO Film product, distributed by all these companies, promised to simplify the handling of stocks by High St chemists i.e. one film from all six suppliers rather than different films from each.\n\nBy the 17th May 1930 issue, within the pages of The Chemist and Druggist magazine, Ilford were notifying chemist shops of the availability of eye catching display materials to attract public attention and assist the sales drive for Ilford Selo film. To see some Ilford advertisements at that time, plus a very early SELO 127 size roll film, and magazine descriptions of visits to the SELO factory, click here and scroll down.\n\nThe Selo company had effectively already come under Ilford control by 1925 but the name 'Selo' was not adopted by Ilford as their film brand name until 1930 (see above).\n\nOnce in use, the name Selo survived in the film name 'Selochrome' until around 1968. Click here, or the advert alongside, to see how Selo film was being advertised in Amateur Phographer magazine in September 1930.\n\nThe 1930 AP advert shows that Ilford size No.20 'Selo' film cost 1/- for 8 exposures.\n\nIlford Panchromatic Film (32ASA) introduced.\n\nlford's advert suggests \"Still Time for Daylight Printing - Finish off those Summer Prints with INTONA, the Ilford Self-Toning P.O.P (printing out paper). It prints right out so that progress may be watched. The paper with the minimum trouble and the most artistic results. Tones ranging from beautiful browns to photographic purple, obtained at will with Hypo (fixer) only. No other chemical required.\"\n\nP.O.P paper was used in contact printing frames to produce positive images merely by the action of light through the negative; it required no developer. When the image looked to have reached the desired density, it just required to be fixed to be made permanent. P.O.P was the fore-runner to 'gaslight' paper that later became known as 'contact' paper. These latter papers did require development as well as fixing but were much 'faster' than P.O.P so needed to be exposed to strong light for just a few seconds before development. P.O.P was very slow and required an exposure of several minutes to daylight - hence Ilford suggesting, in their September advert (click here for an enlarged image), that there was still time for Daylight Printing.\n\nAn early 116 size (6 exposures each 2½\"x4¼\") roll of Selo Orthochromatic film, dated \"Develop Before July 1933\".\n\nThis roll was presumably exported to the continent as it's labelled \"Importe d'Angleterre\" (French for \"Made in England\").\n\nImage from Charlie Kamerman.\n\n1931 Debut of Hypersensitive Panchromatic (initially for Plates), later to become known as HP (as in HP3 etc) Ilford issued, probably for free distribution to amateur photographers via High St chemist shops, a booklet that can be downloaded as a pdf here. The cover image alongside can be seen at larger scale by clicking here.\n\nThis booklet has been made available by Gavin Ritchie. It was issued by Ilford to coincide it with being 12 months from the first commercialisation of Selo roll film on 8th April 1930 (see above).\n\nThe opening reads:\n\nThe Triumph of Selo Film\n\n\"This booklet forms the second chapter in the history of the Selo Film. Its predecessor, \"The Story of the Selo Film,\" written just before the film was placed on the market, was chapter one. Although twelve months only have elapsed, the Selo Film has become an established success, in fact a phenomenal success, for never before within such a short period has any roll film achieved such enormous popularity\".\n\nAt the end it reads:\n\n\"Watch for the Selo Soldier in dealers' windows, on the walls, and in the newspapers, and let every Selo Soldier remind you to load up with Selo Films for successful snapshots. Remember the name SELO\". 1932 Ilford Infra-Red Plate An entry in the 1937-38 Motion Picture Almanac::\n\nRichard S Liddle joined the photographic industry as a salesman of celluloid base and became a Salesman for Selo Film Stock in 1928 and joined Ilford Ltd in 1932.\n\nBy 1937 he was London Sales Manager within Ilford's Cinematograph Department. Selochrome, a higher speed version of the original SELO film, was marketed. Selochrome was around 100ASA, compared to 64ASA for the original SELO(chrome) film. These speeds are relative to post-1960 speed ratings.\n\nSee a 1934 advertisement in Amateur Photographer magazine for the new Selochrome and also read the Lidy Haremaker story, immediately below. 1933 An interesting e-mail (August 2005) from Frank Philipse in the Netherlands, gives extracts from the diary of his relative, Lidy Haremaker (1905-1984), who became a teacher of English in the Netherlands. Lidy was Dutch and lived in the Hague, but she visited Ilford's Selo factory in early 1933 while on a trip to London. Lidy was an intelligent women with broad interests, including photography. On Saturday 7th January she writes \"I wandered a little about Mansion House and came into Cheapside where are many shops, and I saw the newest kind of film to make photographs in the evening.\" She visited the \"factory in Brentwood, which the Ilford people had arranged for me. I had rung up Mr Davidson, manager of Selo Ltd. - Woodman Road - Warley - Brentwood, Essex (tel. 631).\" Lidy visited Selo on Thursday 12th January 1933 ,\"I was back in London by three and went to Cheapside to buy the new kind of film.\" Lidy is clearly referring to a higher speed film than had previously been available.\n\nAn entry in the book 'Silver by the Ton' on page 119, describes Ilford's decision at that time 'to attack' the amateur market seriously. It reads \"Roll films had been sold for some years under a variety of labels, but in 1932 Selochrome film was produced with higher speed, good orthochromatic sensitivity, anti-curl and anti-halo characteristics.\"\n\nThis film caught on well in the UK and the continent and grew to considerable proportions. Hence, \"It was decided ... to produce a Selo panchromatic film. This led to Hypersensitive Panchromatic films.\"\n\nIt seems likely that the higher speed Selochrome film, which was eventually (1935, see below) called Hypersensitive Panchromatic film, was the new film Lidy was excited to try out. Ilford Clorona paper introduced in 1933 (?). Scan sent by \"David\". To see an enlarged version of the illustration, click on the thumbnail or here.\n\nMichael Talbert reports that warm tones on Ilford Clorona paper were popular in the 1930s. The Ilford Manual for 1935 gives two print developers, ID-23 and ID-24, suitable for producing warm-black to sepia to red tones on Clorona paper. The Ilford Manual also states that Clorona paper required a negative of Fair contrast when brown-sepia to red tones were desired. As the tone of the print changed from brown-black to sepia and finally to red, the visual contrast decreased, so a negative of fairly high contrast usually gave the best results. This is exactly what Michael found in the 1960s using Kodak's equivalent, Royal Bromesko paper. 1934\n\nThis red & black covered 36 page booklet is entitled \"ILFORD Plates and Films\" and bears Ilford's steamer logo above the words \"Ilford Limited, Ilford London\". It is presumed to date to February 1934 from the B34 footnote on the back cover.\n\nIt describes the various plates, flat film and roll films available at that time, with useful information relating to their H&D speed rating, exposure and development (tank and dish). It concludes by considering negative defects and describes reduction and intensification techniques, plus how to avoid dichroic fog, 'frilling', halation and coloured patches.\n\nSelo panchromatic (see entry above) is rated at H&D (Hurter & Driffield) 1,200; perhaps 100ASA, barely medium speed by modern standards. Possibly it was this film which was improved and became Hypersensitive Panchromatic (HP) - see below.\n\nThe Ilford Courier, No.3 Volume 2, for June 1934. The front cover shows the Selo soldier leading a Selo girl riding a beach donkey. Click the image or here to download a pdf copy.\n\nThe Courier was a 215mm by 135mm, 14 page, marketing booklet to convey Ilford company strategy to the trade. It was particularly concerned with encouraging good marketing by the trade in their direct contact with customers. This particular issue was wishing the trade to offer the new Selo Rayon printing paper, with 3½\"x2½\" prints costing 'only' ½d (old pence) more, at 2½d (1p) per print, instead of 2d for the long established glossy paper. Selo costumes, to imitate the Selo girl and the Selo soldier, were available on hire to the trade free of charge and carriage paid, \"use them for your local hospital carniivals, fetes etc\".\n\n(See 1939, below, for another issue of the Courier, celebrating 60years of Ilford).\n\nAlongside is an Ilford advert for Selochrome roll film from the rear cover of a June 20th, 1934 issue of the UK magazine \"The Amateur Photographer & Cinematographer\" which subsequently became Amateur Photographer (AP) magazine, still on weekly UK sale.\n\nThe scan was sent to me by Marc Akemann, a US member of the APUG internet forum.\n\nClick here or on the thumbnail to see a larger image.\n\n1935\n\nIlford Hypersensitive Panchromatic (HP) 160ASA and Fine Grain Panchromatic (FP) 28ASA roll films introduced.\n\nThese HP and FP roll films were the fore-runners to the famous HP and FP roll and 35mm film series which culminated in HP5+ (1989) and FP4+ (1990).\n\nIlford Ltd acquired an interest in Dufay-Chromex Ltd. (14-16 Cockspur Street, London; later Dufay Ltd.) for whom it started to manufacture a reversal colour film of the additive type under the brand name Dufaycolor. Dufaycolor had previously (from 1932) been available in England only as 16mm & 9.5mm ciné film, but Ilford's expertise and finance enabled it to be marketed for still photography in 35mm, roll, sheet and film pack forms. Although processing was relatively simple (and instructions were published), Ilford offered a service for roll films.\n\nA 120 size roll film, for 6 exposures, cost 3s/4d (16.5p), over three times the cost of an 8 exposure b&w film (see 1936, below) and developing (to colour transparencies) cost another 1s/6d (7.5p). Hence, 6 Dufaycolor transparencies cost a total of 4/10d (24p), around £17.42p in year 2020 money.\n\nSee some Dufaycolor examples taken about 1936 by John Daly's father, Melvin.\n\nThe Dufaycolor film had a speed rating of around 10ASA (some sources say 8ASA, 21Sch), a third of a conventional b&w film of the day. (Ref: Brian Coe, \"Colour Photography, The first hundred years 1840-1940\", page 72).\n\nAccessories for Viewing Dufaycolor roll film transparencies were available - see the 1938 leaflet sent to me by Brian Wilkinson.\n\nIlford came under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production at the outbreak of war in 1939 and post-1945 it didn't resume an interest in additive colour (prior to WW2, Ilford had already started R&D into subtractive colour). However, Dufay Ltd survived into the 1950s and Dufaycolor film was still being disposed through Amateur Photographer 'small ads' in the early 1960s; viz. a 100ft 35mm bulk roll is priced at £1 and a 50ft roll at 12/6d (62.5p). Processing kits for four films are priced at 12/6d (62.5p) or processing vouchers (presumably for one film) at 6/- (30p).\n\nTo watch a 9minute Dufaycolor film featuring the Selo Film Laboratory, at Brentwood, Essex, click here (catalogue No.6947 of the East Anglian Film Archive within the University of East Anglia ~ UEA)\n\nOther films relating to the Selo Factory, viewable at the East Aglian Film Archive, are:\n\nCatalogue No.2843, being a 19minute film made by well-known amateur cinephotographer George Sewell, featuring 16mm film processing (developing and subsequent printing to a positive) of Ilfords Selo amateur film stock.\n\nPrinting the 16mm negative film to a positive for projection was done using a Schustek printer, that is reported was also capable of reducing 35mm film size down to a 16mm positive.\n\nCatalogue No.7980, being an 8minute film showing aerial footage of the Selo factory and the nearby town of Brentwood and surrounding areas.\n\nThis 32 page 180mm by 120mm booklet explains techniques for making lantern slides from existing negatives, by contact or reduction printing. \"Of all the fascinating bypaths of photography it is doubtful whether any gives such complete satisfaction and permanent pleasure as the making and exhibition of lantern slides. ...it enables the photographer to see his pictures at their very best, and to share his pleasure with a large or small circle of friends. The amateur photographer with scientific or artistic inclinations.....can producer lantern lectures of the utmost educational value.\"\n\nRecommended Ilford lantern plates are 'Special' for brilliant black tone, 'Warm Black' for warm image tone, 'Alpha' for slide making by contact and 'Gaslight', which can be handled in subdued artificial light and especially suitable for weak negatives. The rear page shows the booklet to be printed in England with a J35 footnote, indicating October 1935.\n\nAmateur films are listed as Selochrome, the extra fast roll film for fine grain, Selo Fine Grain Panchromatic roll film, fully colour corrected and of extreme speed and fine grain, and Selo Hypersensitive Panchromatic Roll Film, \"the fastest panchromatic roll film made\".\n\nA photograph of an attractive young lady whose dress is bedecked with many Selochrome film boxes.\n\nSent by Paul Knudsen of Phoenix, Arizona, USA but the picture was actually found by a lady named Angel Burke from Prescott Arizona who procured it in an estate sale. It had been pasted in a scrap book at one time.\n\nPaul writes that he is not sure whether its an Ilford advertisement or more likely it was a models print as it has a pebble surface not suitable for print reproduction.\n\nI have dated the picture by (possibly) identifying the camera the lady is holding - a Kodak Junior 620 of 1935 vintage.\n\nClick here, or on the thumbnail image, to see an enlarged version.\n\nSelochrome 'Super Speed' film pack, containing 12 flat films size 4¼\" x 3¼\" (Size No.18).\n\nIntroduced in 1935, with a speed rating (ref: Silver by the Ton) of 50ASA (using the post-1960 speed rating standard).\n\n\"Highly ortho, anti halo, multi coated.\"\n\nThe pack illustrated bears a 'develop before September 1939' instruction and is Batch No.75C6B-F876.\n\nThe instruction leaflet with this film pack was printed in April 1934 (D34) but is presumably an instruction leaflet appropriate to all contemporary Ilford Film Packs so may not have been printed for this specific film. 'Silver by the Ton' lists the Selochrome 'Super Speed' film pack's first appearance to 1935.\n\nA cardboard box that originally contained 16 quarter plate size (3¼\"x4¼\") Ilford Process Plates.\n\nI believe their use was in high contrast copying. The recommended developer was ID13, which was Ilford's developer for 'photomechanical work' resulting in 'screen' or 'line' negatives or positives. After the plates were developed & fixed the resulting image could be cleared (using Farmer's reducer which increases contrast) or bleached and intensified.\n\nAll the relevant formulae appear on the front of the box, beneath the title 'ILFORD PROCESS PLATES', and the box has the footnote D35, indicating its selling date was probably April 1935.\n\nAn Ilford Limited souvenir book for the George V Silver Jubilee on 6th May 1935 is known to exist, presumably of similar format to that of the 12th May 1937 (see below) souvenir booklet produced by Ilford Ltd for the Coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth (Queen mother to Elizabeth II). One YouTube video of the Jubilee event is viewable here. By 1935, Ilford was marketing Selo 16mm 'safety' cine film (positive, negative and reversal).\n\nMat Simpson has sent me a link to a sequence of films shot by his grandfather, believed around the time 16mm cine film was first introduced by Ilford. Although Kodak introduced the monochrome 16mm format in 1923, it would have been expensive and so may not have been widely used in the UK. Mat's grandfather's film is a wonderful record of happy middle class family life in the mid to late 1930s and a credit to Mat's grandfather's skill with a cine camera. Confirmation of the use of Selo film can be found at the points 6m 58s into the film and again at 16m 41s.\n\nThe 'End' title 'shot' shown at 6m 58s was probably a cardboard 'still' made available by Ilford for the convenience of their film users but also it made sure that films included an advert (that would be viewed by the audience) of their Selo product.\n\nMat believes his grandfather was working in management for Ilford during the time the film sequences were shot. 1936 An Ilford Selo print envelope shows that developing a Selo film cost 6d (2.5p) and each print cost 2½d (1p). Around this same time in the UK a loaf of bread cost 1.4p, a pint of milk cost 1.3p and the average cost of a house was £515.\n\nWith Ilford size No.20 'Selo' b&w film costing 1/- (5p), taking 8 exposures and having the film developed and printed would have cost around 3/2d (16p), or the equivalent of over £11 in 2020. In 2009 a pint of milk cost around 45p and a loaf of bread 65p, all around a 40x increase over the mid-1930s.\n\nBut house prices are up over 300x.\n\nA copy of \"The Ilford Message\" magazine [volume 1 number 3] was auctioned through ebay January 2006. I've no information on this publication, so anyone who recognises it, I'd be interested to learn more. The ebay vendor described it as being supplied FREE by Ilford to various photographic shops & distributors, to promote Ilford products. This particular edition contains a centre spread on the 'new' Dufaycolor film (probably an announcement relating to Ilford's involvement in this technology which began in 1935, see above).\n\nAn Ilford Graphic Arts materials catalogue dated September 1936. Its rather nice cover shows sheet films and plate boxes from 1936. To view it in more detail and also three of its pages, click the image or here.\n\nThe fastest material in those days was Ilford Hypersensitive plates, rated at 2500 H and D, or about 100 ISO. The sheet film version was rated at 2000 H and D, or about 80 ISO.\n\nInformation and images courtesy of Michael Talbert.\n\n1937 Ilford FP1, FP2 (125ASA) and HP2 Plates introduced.\n\nIn July 1937 Ilford stopped marketing Dufaycolor (announcement in Miniature Camera Magazine) and the responsibility reverted to Dufay-Chromex Ltd of Elstree, Hertfordshire (could this be the previous Wellington & Ward premises ?). At that time, Mr George H Sewell, ARPS (a well known amateur cinephotographer and author) was Sales Manager at Dufay. This change possibly coincided with the start of Ilford's R&D into its own subtractive colour film process. Despite this, there is an Ilford 4-page colour advertisement promoting Dufaycolor in the British Journal Photographic Almanac (BJPA) for 1937. Ilford Selochrome Plates, speed rating Ilford E = 64ASA pre-1960 speed revision. Afterwards 125ASA.\n\nA 28 page booklet entitled \"ILFORD book of Formulae\", footnote A37, hence presumed January 1937.\n\nIt lists formulae for Ilford Developer (ID) 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11 (i.e. the famous ID-11, same as Kodak's D-76), 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, and 36, and advises on their specific uses. There is also much other chemical information on toning prints, hypo eliminator, emulsion hardening, rapid drying, desensitization, intensifiers and reducers, fixing baths, developer stain removing etc etc.\n\nCezar Popescu has kindly provided me with a scanned version of this booklet, which he has made word searchable by using OCR software.

The miniature Compass Camera was manufactured by a Swiss watch-making firm and introduced by its British owner/distributors in spring 1937. It was designed by Noel Pemberton-Billing (see Readers Write, AP, 9Sep64). It sold for £30 and was originally intended to use miniature 2\"x2¼\" plates, giving 24x36mm images, but by September the design owners and distributors, Compass Cameras Ltd, 57 Berners Street, London W.1, introduced a roll film back. Negatives were the same size as 35mm, but were placed transversely on unperforated film of width 1.5\" (38mm). Each spool enabled the taking of 6 pictures on a film 9.25\" long, with a 7\" paper leader and a 4\" paper trailing length. Hence, the film did not have full length paper backing. This saved on spool thickness, a similar idea to 220 roll film introduced by Kodak around 1966.\n\nThese roll films weren't popular as any attempt to process them revealed that the film had been rolled so tightly that their inherent curl made processing difficult, while their short length was difficult to handle.\n\nThe Compass camera went out of production during the 2nd World War. It never really caught on as a Leica with an f3.5 interchangeable lens could be purchased for about the same price.\n\nBut it was a precision instrument and, post-WW2, the many that survived, probably having had relatively little use since new, were given a new lease of life by the introduction of a roll film back taking the 828 \"Bantam\" film size, giving 8 exposures 24mmx36mm. To read a 1958 article from Modern camera Magazine (MCM) describing this new (in 1958) roll film back, click here.\n\nIn celebration of the 12th May 1937 Coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth, Ilford Limited produced a souvenir book of photographs taken by photographers working for Newspapers and Press Agencies. All original negatives were on Ilford Hypersensitive Panchromatic Plates and Ilford Double-X-Press Plates.\n\nClick here or on the image to download a pdf of the book. Be patient as it is a 10MB file.\n\nBook made available by courtesy of David Muggleton.\n\nThe 22nd edition of 'Panchromatism', price 6d (2.5p) by ILFORD Ltd. Pictures courtesy of Roy Hammans. A letter from Ilford (letter heading shown 1940, below) was contained within the book when Roy purchased it. The letter was in response to questions about information in the book. The book has no date and so it has been assumed to date to 1937, as the 23rd edition (see below) is known to date to May 1938.\n\nThe book contains the separate Ilford 'colour' test chart, illustrated alongside.\n\nThe text below the colour test chart can be read here. \"If a photograph (of the chart) is taken using a (b&w) panchromatic plate and a filter giving full (colour) correction, the two halves of the test chart should approx. match.\n\nThis copy of 'Night Photography ~ Picture making at night - indoors and out', was owned by Charles Read, ARPS, who was a founder member of the Great Yarmouth & District Photographic Society and collected items of photographic nostalgia. Sadly, Charles died in August 2008, whereupon some GYDPS members were given the task of sorting out his collection.\n\nPaul Godfrey, who was a member of the GYDPS in his youth (he left in 1968) keeps in touch with friends who are still members. It was through that connection that Paul was able to send me the scan of the cover of the booklet and also a pdf file of the book's contents. Click here or on the thumbnail of the cover (left) to download the pdf. It extols the virtues of Selo Hypersensitive Panchromatic roll film and plates (35mm users had to wait until 1938 for the release of HP2).\n\nPaul points out the similarity between this booklet (dated November 1937; K37) with the booklet 'Winter and Night Photography ~ Indoors and Out' which is shown below in the (August) 1938 'slot'. The difference seems to be that the 1938 booklet includes mention of HP2 film for the 35mm user.\n\nMy thanks to Murray-Rust for sending me the following link, http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3071805, which shows a wall painted advertisement for Selo and Selochrome films. Presumably the wall was once part of a chemist's shop, when chemists were the normal source of photographic films, equipment, chemicals and developing&printing. Its exact date is unknown, but is believed to date before WW2. Although defaced by time and building modifications, it can be clearly seen to say \"SELO FILMS. GET YOUR SELO AND SELOCHROME FILMS HERE. THE FILMS FOR BEST RESULTS.\" Then underneath it advertises \"DEVELOPING & PRINTING\". Notice that the background colour appears to be the usual Ilford yellow (ochre), used on their film packaging until the mid-1960s. For an example of this yellow, see the Selo film packaging in my 1930 'slot', above. 1938\n\nIn autumn 1938, Ilford started the free distribution of an 8 page News Sheet called 'Ilford News - for Photographic Societies' to subscribing photographic clubs.\n\nIssue (Series 1 No 2) alongside carries the information:\n\n\"We should indeed be ungrateful did we not publicly express our thanks for the many hundreds of congratulatory letters which we have received on the first number of \"Ilford News\" and also for the many excellent suggestions sent us. We shall endeavour to make use of these suggestions as it is our desire to make this journal of the utmost use to all society and club members. It has been made clear to us from your letters that \"Ilford News\" has received a spontaneous welcome and we shall spare no effort to maintain the standard of the first number for all issues of the journal.\"\n\nIssue 2 must have been published in December 1938 as it carries the holly framed message \"A Happy Christmas to all Photographers; Ilford Limited\".\n\nClick the links to download and read issues No.1 and No.2, believed to date to November 1938 and December 1938.\n\nThe subsequent four issues can be accessed below, in the 1939 section.\n\nIssues Nos 1, 3 and 4 are available courtesy of Keith Walker.\n\nIlford Anti-Halo Fine Grain Ordinary Flat Film. Speed rating unknown. Ilford Ordinary Plates introduced. Very slow speed, Ilford Group A, Weston 3; equivalent to maybe 8ASA / ISO in the modern speed rating system.\n\nThe film pack image shown here courtesy of Bernard Rose.\n\nAlthough plates bearing the name 'Ordinary' were first marketed in 1885, the name was revived for use in 1938. But this package must date from much later again - compare it with the earlier packaging of Fine Grain Flat Plates, shown above. Since it does not bear the paddle steamer trade mark, it likely dates from post-WW2. Ordinary Plates were still being sold in 1950. A leaflet scanned by Paul Godfrey describing the use of Selo 'GasLight' paper, though ILFORD write in the leaflet \"we prefer to call it the paper for perfect print-making by artificial Iight, since any form of artificial light may be used although electric light, gaslight, or the light of oil and pressure spirit lamps are preferable. This independence of daylight and the comfort of printing in normal surroundings renders printing on Selo Paper a very pleasant, and companionable evening occupation for the winter\".\n\nClick here on on the cover image alongside, to view the complete leaflet as a PDF file.

Ilford used this booklet to appeal to amateur photographers who might otherwise put their camera away from October to April, expecting the winter light to be too dull for picture-making. Ilford stressed that this reason was now made obsolete with the introduction of Selo Hypersensitive Panchromatic roll film and Hypersensitive Fine Grain Panchromatic (H.P.2) film for 35mm users. In both cases the film speed had recently been increased to H&D 3,500; 31° Scheiner (maybe 200ASA in modern terms).\n\nThe Selo films 'family' at the time consisted of Selo Ortho (26°), Selo Chrome (29°), Selo F.P (27°) and Selo H.P. (31°), all being roll films, and Selo Chrome (27°), Selo F.P (24°) and Selo H.P.2 (31°) for 35mm cameras.\n\nRoll film H.P.2 and F.P.2 were introduced in 1939, see entry below.\n\nA cassette of 35mm 36 exposure Selo H.P.2 fim for \"Leica etc\". Speed rating = Ilford Group F = 32 DIN. Thus, the film was rated at 125ASA, equivalent to a 250ASA emulsion after the 1960 'universal' speed rating revision, (see notes at the end of my Chronology Introduction web page). 1939 Ilford News issue No.3 for January, No.4 for February, No.5 for March and No.6 for April 1939 can be downloaded by clicking the links or the thumbnails alongside.

Issues Nos 1, 3 and 4 are available courtesy of Keith Walker.\n\nSeries 1 Volume 6 of 'Ilford News' carries a Supplement with the heading \"Sixty Years of Progress\".\n\n\"Sixty years of applied research and strenuous work in the service of photography is the proud record of Ilford Limited whose Diamond Jubilee is celebrated this year.\"\n\nApart from the Chairman (see left) Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps, K.C.B; D.S.O, others named are Mr F.F.Renwick (research dept); Dr.Olaf Bloch (photographic emulsions); Dr.Kendall (sensitizing dyes in the Rodenside laboratory - see the 1940 entry for his contribution to replacing the developing agent Metol with Phenidone); Dr.G.B.Harrison & Dr.S.O.Rawling (Selo Laboratories).\n\nSir Ivor Philipps died 14th August 1940 (Ref: BJPA, 1941).\n\nThe Ilford Courier, Vol.8 No.2 for June 1939. (see above, 1934, for an earlier copy). Click here, or the image, to download a copy as a pdf file.\n\nAs in Ilford News (above) the Chairman Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps authored a 3 page account of the company's technology progress since it started 60 years previously.\n\nAn interesting article on the exposure latitude of Selo film, where the film was subjected to exposures of the same sunny outdoors subject over an exposure range of 3,000:1, and claiming all negatives gave acceptable prints. From ten times under-exposed to 300 times over-exposed. Such latuitude was claimed to be good for film sales as snapshot success was virtually guaranteed.\n\nIlford launched it's 'PLASTIKA' photographic paper (warm black image colour and wide exposure latitude - 9 paper surfaces) and a range of films. H.P.2 (100ASA, equivalent to 200ASA post-1960) replaced the original Hypersensitive Panchromatic rollfilm (see 1935, above)\n\nF.P.2 (40ASA, equivalent to 80ASA post-1960), Selo brand roll film launched.\n\nBooklet produced in June 1939 detailing the production of Lantern Slides from negatives. \"Of all the fascinating bypaths of photography, it is doubtful whether any gives such complete satisfaction and permanent pleasure as the making and exhibition of lantern slides\".\n\nSpecial Lantern plates in 3 degrees of contrast for slide making by contact or reduction methods. Warm Black Lantern plates yield beautiful warm black tones. Alpha Lantern plates for slide maiing by contact, give a wonderful variety of colour by varying exposure and development. Gaslight Lantern plates for use in subdued artificial light. Specially suitable for making slides from weak negatives.\n\nFor similar, see 1935. Thanks to David Muggleton for the loan of this booklet.\n\nAnother Ilford booklet, courtesy of David Muggleton.\n\nDated H39, so August 1939, this booklet encourages the taking of pictures by artifical light, Photofloods and flash powder, so that photography can continue throughout the winter months.\n\nTo view the complete booklet as a pdf, click the image or here.\n\nA 9.5mm metal cine film spool, clearly embossed with the brand name SELO.\n\nIt is owned by Christine Ellis and interestingly is of the less common 9.5mm format. Christine says \"...taken in Warwickshire...The Selo reel is about 1939 (maybe 1940) as it contains film of my husband and his older brother .......\"\n\nAlso embossed onto the film spool are the words \"FOR PROJECTOR USE ONLY\".\n\nAn orbituary for James Booker Blakemore Wellington (aka J B B Wellington) appeared in the BJPA for 1940. He died 8th October 1939. Free BMD suggests he died aged 81 in Eastbourne.\n\n\"Founder of the famous firm of Wellington & Ward, J.B.B. Wellington was probably most widely known as a pictorial photographer of outstanding merit and high artistic attainments; yet his real work lay in his many contributions to technical and industrial photography. First manager of the Kodak works at Harrow, he later went to Elliott & Sons, and was scientific and technical director of Wellington & Ward until the amalgamation with Ilford, Ltd. In 1935 he received the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society (FRPS).\"\n\nTo view some Wellington & Ward packaging, click here.\n\nThe picture alongside, from this website, is believed to have been taken in the early 1900s.\n\n1940 Ilford launched the world's first true 'MULTIGRADE' photographic paper, but it wasn't an immediate success. The time was not yet right. Users were not equipped with filter-drawer enlargers and the print quality was insufficiently consistent. It was withdrawn by the end of the war. An entry in the British Journal Photographic Almanac (BJPA) for 1941 reads \"The revolutionary new Ilford Development Paper 'Multigrade' is, as is now fairly generally known, a material on which the contrast of the print can be varied at will by altering the colour of the printing light.\"\n\nFor further Multigrade history, click here.\n\n'Phenidone', Ilford's trademark for l-Phenyl-3-Pyrazolidone, was first prepared in 1890, however it was not until 1940 that Dr.J.D.Kendall, in the laboratories of Ilford Limited, discovered the photographic reducing properties of this chemical as an alternative to 'Metol'.\n\nA packet Selo Gas Light contact printing paper, sent to me by Michael Talbert. To see a larger version of this image, click here or on the image.\n\nMichael believes the packet dates to about 1940.\n\nHe says: Its got a code on the back S31P meaning Selo, (grade) 3, 1 (glossy), P (single weight).\n\n1941 Ilford Micro Neg Microfilm.\n\nIlford HP3 Roll and 35mm Film first appeared. Initially 125ASA (equivalent to 250ASA in the post-1960 rating method). In 1955 they became 200ASA. Post-1960 the 200ASA emulsion was revised to 400ASA but there was no actual speed increase, it was in recognition that with better exposure determination methods at that time, there was no longer need for film manufacturers to include an exposure safety margin. This 2x speed increase applied to all black&white films of all makes.\n\nFor early HP3 packaging, view here.\n\nOrion Bromide paper, sold in a hermetically sealed metal tube, possibly for war-time use in tropical countries.\n\nThis example was an e-bay purchase by Leon Bren, in Australia.\n\nHe found the tin still had its original seal intact. When opened (in his darkroom) he found the paper was still able to produce very acceptable images after 71 years of uncertain 'storage'.\n\nClick the image to see more pictures and to read comment by Leon. 1942 Ilford launched FP3 and HP3 plates. FP3 is rated at 125ASA and HP3 at 200ASA, the latter higher than the 125ASA rating of HP3 film released in 1941.\n\nThe picture of the box of FP3 plates by courtesy of Michael Talbert who says \"...box of Ilford FP3 plates dating from 1942 to about 1946. They have an H & D speed of 4500, approximately 32 Scheiner or 125 ISO; quite a fast plate for those days. HP3 plates were only two thirds of a stop faster!\n\nFP3 became available as FP3 film about 1946; 35 mm at first but with a drastic speed reduction to 40 ISO.\n\nAll above speeds refer to values prior to the re-rating which occurred in 1960.\n\nTo see a larger version of this and other FP3 (and the later FP4) packaging, view here.\n\nTo see a larger version of this and other HP3 (and later HPS) packaging, view here. Selochrome roll film with a 1942 expiry date.\n\nDuring the war years Ilford were proud of their Lecture Team 'which carried on'.\n\n\"Throughout the war many photographic societies carried on as usual and the Ilford team of lecturers kept their dates and fulfilled their obligations. This is a service Ilford maintained throughout the war to foster and maintain enthusiasm.\"\n\nLancelot Vining, FRPS (Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and Member of the Council), FIBP (Fellow of the Institute of British Photographers), was one of the Ilford Team of Lecturers. Mr Vining was still providing this Ilford service to photographic clubs in 1952/53, together with Donald Allen, Karl Pollak and D S Moran.\n\nLancelot Vining worked as a Daily Mirror press photographer before the First World War. Called up in 1916 he joined what was then The Royal Flying Corp. They sent him to Farnborough Photographic School where he was given the rank of Wing Photographic Officer and based at Netherhaven (information from John Coathup, PCCGB).\n\nLancelot Vining spent 40 years in Fleet St as Art Editor and Press Photographer. He was also author of the famous book 'My Way with a Miniature', first published in 1941 and reprinted in 1942, '43 and '44. He had a regular column in Amateur Photographer from 1941 entitled 'Miniature Camera Gossip' to do with all things 35mm. He was a 'prickly' character who spoke his mind !\n\nAnother member of the Ilford lecture team throughout the war and afterwards, was Henry G. Russell A.R.P.S. F.R.S.A. Known as Harry to his family and friends. Anthony (Tony) Russell, his son, provided me with this insight.\n\nHenry Russell wrote a feature called \"Between Ourselves\" under the pseudonym \"Minicam\" in Miniature Camera Magazine (MCM) from (almost) its inception until the mid-1950s. MCM first appeared around December 1936 and Henry's first contribution (6 pages) appeared in the October 1937 edition (Vol.1 No.11). The photograph is from the 'banner' at the top of the early editions. He ran his own company, handling advertising for Ilford, Photax and Johnsons. From 1938, until he died in 1960, Henry was responsible for 80% of Ilford's advertising copy. He also authored a considerable number of books on \"miniature\" photography. He was a respected Exhibition Judge and wrote articles under his own name for the monthly magazine 'Camera World' during the mid-1950s.\n\n1943\n\nHP3 Sheeet Film (also known as Cut Film or Flat Film) first appeared in 1943, at a speed rating of 125ASA i.e. Ilford Speed Rating 'F' (equivalent to 250ASA in the post-1960 speed rating system)\n\nAlongside is shown an early box of HP3 Matt Sheet Film that was manufactured pre-1955, as the speed is shown as 125 Weston (=ASA=ISO). Ilford increased the speed of all HP3 film emulsions to 200 Weston (=ASA=ISO) around 1955 to bring the speed in line with HP3 plates. Experienced photographers could expose HP3 at 400 ASA (ISO) when developing in most of the Ilford film developers, with ID-48 being the exception but Microphen giving a slightly higher speed increase to 650 ASA (ISO).\n\nThis box contained HP3 Matt Film, which had a matt finish on the non-emulsion side, giving the processed negatives a soft, flat appearance, although the contrast was not altered by the matt finish. The purpose of the matt finish was to give a surface for re-touching of the negative in pencil or dye, as might be required for portrait negatives. It was much easier to re-touch in pencil onto a matt surface than onto a surface that would have otherwise been glossy.\n\nHP3 films and plates were widely used for portrait photography in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nFor this, and other, HP3 packaging, view here.\n\nHP3 Cine and Aerial Film also first released.\n\nTo view some Ilford Bromide and Selo Gaslight printing papers for this era, click here.\n\nImages supplied by Michael Talbert\n\n1944\n\nRed Seal Acetate Medical & Dental X-Ray Film.\n\nThe image alongside, sent by Mike Ratcliff, is believed to illustrate the type of box used to supply this product.

It shows its war time heritage by saying ILFORD LONDON 'Contractors to His Majestys Government'.\n\nThe 'Paddle Steamer' trademark is on the LHS and the SELO trademark is on the RHS.\n\nBeneath the Paddle Steamer it says 'Manufacturers of Ilford and Selo Photographic Materials'.\n\nJohn Alexander has emailed with recollections of working in the original Ilford factory site at Roden Street, Ilford, Essex, when he was a teenager.\n\nClick here to read his account of those times. Stan Scholes has e-mailed to say \"My first job after leaving school in 1944 was at Dufay Chromex, Borehamwood, near Elstree, Hertfordshire., as a lab assistant earning £1 17s 6d. (£1.88p). .........of the 2 or 3 years I was at Borehamwood, I can only remember the name of my boss, Dr Walters. As laboratory assistant I was mainly involved in trying various dyes to find their stability to light and their colour spectrum for better cut off, ie blue that would not transmit any red etc. They had some of the processing tanks etc in some of the buildings but these were standing empty. The site at Borehamwood is now the Boulevard Shopping Centre.\" (Theobald Street, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 4PR). 1945\n\nThe paddle-steamer trademark, used since 1886, was dropped and the new advertising slogan \"Ilford films, for Faces and Places\" was coined.\n\nIlford's Lecture Service, which operated throughout the War (see 1942 above) announced \"Today, with calm restored, we are more eager then ever to provide the services of our qualified team of lecturers, so if you have a vacant date, drop a line to the Ilford Lecture Service, Ilford Ltd, London.\"\n\nIn AP for 5th September 1945, John Milner, the Hon. Sec. Petersfield Photographic Society writes \"I feel the time has come to thank Messrs. Ilford, Ltd, publicly and wholeheartedly for the wonderful way in which they have helped photographic societies to carry on during the last five or six war years, by sending their lecturers and demonstrators all over the country, and at no cost whatever to the societies concerned. The Petersfield Photographic Society acknowledges that it owes this fine firm a great debt, and it is to be hoped that clubs and their members will bear in mind that the products of this company are second to none, when the market becomes flooded with foreign merchandise.\"\n\nA V-2 rocket landed on Ilford's original Roden Street factory one day (this site, suggests 20th February 1945). The emulsion laboratories were in an old building with the windows permanently blocked out. The explosion blew the windows in so that light could enter, and this interrupted manufacturing. See the end of this web page for more details.\n\nAlso, see the following paragraph for the more serious consequences of this air attack.\n\nThanks to David Mittelstadt for pointing the following out to me, and to Martin Reed of Darkside for its source.\n\nA leaflet (here in pdf format) entitled \"The Remarkable Achievements of Photography in the War ~ A Story of the War Effort of ILFORD, Ltd, Ilford, London\". It records that in the above V-2 rocket attack, 3 emloyeees were killed and 12 wounded.\n\n1946\n\nBefore the war Ilford imported all its requirements of film base, first from the Celluloid Corporation (USA) and later from Gevaert (Belgium). Imports continued during the war, mainly from Du Pont (USA). In 1946, at the suggestion of the Government, Ilford and B.X. Plastics Ltd. set up a jointly owned company, Bexford Ltd., at Lawford, near Manningtree, Essex, to manufacture cellulose acetate film base.\n\nA February 1953 article on B.X. Plastics ltd can be downloaded as a pdf here.\n\nBy 1955 Ilford had ceased to import film base and relied wholly on Bexford for its requirements of this material. The B.X. Plastics factory in Manningtree was known locally as \"the BX\" and their most famous product was the Bex Bissell Carpet Shampooer. BX also made hard rubber 3 gallon tanks like the Kodak ones but were branded as Ilford and were slightly narrower and would not take Kodak racks. Following her graduation, Margaret Thatcher worked for a short time as a research chemist for BX Plastics in the late 1940s.\n\nChristopher Webbe, in an e-mail July 2017, tells me \"E.G. Couzens, my grandfather, was managing director of BX Plastics at the time that Bexford was established and who I understand had a hands-on role in solving the not insignificant problems of setting up a film casting operation. As an aside, Gordon Couzens was Research Manager at BX Plastics when Maggie Thatcher was engaged as a research chemist in the 1940s. Gordon Couzens wrote a number of books about plastics together with V E Yarsley. He also wrote a book called A Short History of the Film Casting Process in which Bexford has a somewhat prominent position and there are, of course, a number of mentions of Ilford\".\n\nThe company was acquired by Xylonite in the 1980s. Paul Godfrey reports that the BX factory complex is/was right beside the NorwichLondon Liverpool Street railway and viewing from the train its possible to see that demolition contractors have nearly flattened the factory (Aug 2009). The site is now up for re-development.\n\nIlford FP3 Fine Grain Panchromatic Safety Film introduced, initially with a speed of 40ASA (Ilford speed group D), but around 1951 it became Weston Meter (ASA) 64, Ilford Meter 29º and Ilford Speed Group E. In 1960 the same emulsion speed was revised to 125ASA.\n\nThe film box illustrated contains an 8 exposure roll of FP3 on an 828 spool. The 828 'Bantam' format was introduced by Kodak in 1935, giving negatives 28mm x 40mm (30% bigger than 35mm). This particular roll of film passed its expiry date in February 1960. The diminutive 828 film box is only some ²/3 the size of a 120 in all dimensions and is noticeably smaller even than 127 film.\n\nTo view a larger image and other FP3 packaging, click on the image or here.\n\nThis image was sent to me by Jim Fisk of the Great Yarmouth Photographic Society (see the bottom of this web page) and a friend of Paul Godfrey. He says \"It came from the Charlie Read collection\".\n\nIt shows a box of six Selo H.P.3 35mm refills. \"Ilford Speed Group F: Specially cut and numbered for use in Leica Cameras\".\n\nClick on the image, or here, to see an enlarged view.\n\nThe expiry date of these films was July 1948. The packaging lacks the Paddle Steamer trademark, which (as stated in the 1945 'slot' above) was 'dropped' in 1945, so it seems this pack was made around 1946, meaning it was one of the last packs of film refills made with the 'Selo H.P.3' name. Shortly after 1946 the name 'Selo' seems to have been dropped by Ilford and the film became just H.P.3. In another couple of years it was named simply HP3, i.e. no stops between the letters.\n\nThe original instruction booklet for the Ilford Exposure Meter Model B (on its page 8) shows that, even at the time the booklet was produced (March 1938), the Ilford Speed Group range had already increased to include the letter 'F', necessitated by \"the recent increase in speeds of Ilford Hypersensitive Panchromatic Plates and Films\". This presumably refers to H.P.2 becoming available in the 35mm format in 1938.\n\n6 exposure Selochrome film with an August 1946 expiry date.\n\nIlford speed rating 'E', B.S.I. Scheiner 29°. Equivalent to ASA 64 (same speed as the FP3 film above).\n\nAn Ilford Selochrome print of the entrance to the newly opened HMP Falfield, later to become Leyhill Prison in Tortworth Court, between Gloucester and Bristol. It was taken by a (then) 10 year old Tony Cunnane whose father was a prison officer. Tony has an extensive web site describing his life and RAF career, including 11 years as the Red Arrows Public Relations Officer.\n\nTony quotes the Ilford advertising slogan \"Focus right then gently press: Ilford Selo spells success\". It was widely used in newspaper and magazine adverts of the time and certainly during the latter years of the war. He recalls it was often associated with an attractive girl posing provocatively, a camera to her eye, taking a snap of her boy friend or scenic view.\n\n1947 Ilford announce a sophisticated 35mm interchangeable lens rangefinder camera called the \"Witness\", but it was slow to reach the market for various reasons, including a shortage of high quality lenses (see 1950 & 1953). The Witness was conceived by Werner Rothschild, who had worked in the German camera industry during the 1930s and, after the war, started the UK photographic company Daroth (an abbreviation in part derived from the surname Rothschild) and similarly used Daron as a lens name. Robert Sternberg was a working colleague of Rothschild who played the major role in designing the Witness (see 1991).\n\nManufacture of the Witness was later taken over by Peto Scott Electrical Instruments.\n\nA 42 page booklet, priced at 2s/6d (12.5p), describing the use of Ilford contact and enlargement print materials through all stages of their use including choice of developers, print toning, presentation & choice of border and finally titling the finished exhibition print. A footnote on the last page shows PE/C.47, presumably meaning it was published in March 1947. The printers are Lund Humphries who give a number 18677.3.47, which again indicates March 1947.\n\nA small pocket in the rear cover of the booklet contains \"Specimen Surfaces of Ilford Bromide, Plastika and Contact papers\".\n\nSome images of Ilford Bromide printing paper from around this time can be seen here, courtesy of Simon Spaans.\n\nMy thanks to Emma Fuell (see her 'Blitz and Pieces' website) for keeping me informed of information from Peter Amos (Miles Aircraft) and from Ken Fostekew (Reading Museum).\n\nThe Miles Copycat (of which little is now known) was an early form of Xerox copier. The device was originally invented by the Miles technicians to copy the huge amount of technical drawings needed when manufacturing aircraft, a great improvement over the old 'blueprints'. They used the same electrostatic principles later patented by Xerox. Pictures of the Ilford branded version can be viewed here, courtesy of Emma Fuell.\n\n1947 British Industries Fair Advert as Manufacturers of the Copycat Non-optical Facsimile Copying Machines, complete developing process and print driers. No dark room. \"Copylith\" Reflex copying dyeline prints and preparation of Lithographic Plates .\n\nIn November 1947, Miles Aircraft ceased trading. There were many reasons for their financial problems, not all of the company's making and questions remain about the behaviour of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, the company's bank and certain of its financial advisors. In fact, when the company was restructured, many non-aircraft activities prospered in other hands, notably the Biro pen, the Copycat photocopier and its range of electric actuators.\n\n1947 Listed Exhibitor - British Industries Fair. Manufacturers of Photographic Plates, Papers, Films, Accessories, Apparatus, Chemicals, X-Ray Films, Paper, Intensifying Screens, X-Ray Accessories, Apparatus, Materials and Apparatus for document Copying, Materials for Cathode Ray Recording, Glazing and Drying Machines (Olympia, Ground Floor, Stand No. E.1783).\n\nIlford made an Ilford Reflex Document Paper No.50 for use with the Miles Copycat and apparently put their name to the Reflex Printer itself, though the printer was manufactured by Miles Aircraft Ltd of Reading, England.\n\nIlford claimed their paper was suitable \"For all Reflex Copying Machines. With Ilford Reflex Document Paper No. 50 you can obtain perfect copies from every type of original, including manuscript, typescript, pencil notes, plans and drawings containing fine detail\".\n\n1948 ILFORD launched its first Colour Film \"D\" 10 ASA. (and in 1956 Type \"F\" for clear flashbulbs) This was (unusually) a non-substantive reversal film, as was Kodachrome.\n\nTo read a full account of Ilford's attempts over the following 20 years to move into the field of colour film photography, click here.\n\nWork started on a silver dye-bleach process for making prints directly from colour transparancies, pioneered by Dr Bela Gaspar in the 1930s but mainly used for motion pictures (Gaspar based his work on that started by Austrian, Karl Schnitzel, in 1905). The process, which eventually became Cibachrome (see 1963), produced the first successful prints around 1949. This work lead to the launch, in 1953, of a service to provide colour prints from transparencies\n\nTake a look at THE PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA site where there is a page devoted to Alf Pyner, who joined Ilford after his time in the RAF during WW2 and had a long association with Ilfords experiments to develop colour materials.\n\nPan F b&w film first appeared, initially as 35mm and a short time later as 16mm cine film stock. At that time it was rated at the lower (than later Pan F) film speed of 23° Scheiner (Ilford Exposure Meter C; ASA 16).\n\nIn November 1956 (ref: Camera World magazine) Pan F speed was increased to Scheiner 25°, ASA 25 (ASA 16 in tungsten light). Post-1960 Pan F became 50ASA in daylight, when the same emulsion was re-rated in speed (as were all b&w films at that time). The Borough of Ilford presented Princess Elizabeth with a specially commissioned ILFORD Advocate Camera, costing £340.\n\nThe camera was stolen, but later recovered, when it was sent to be repaired.\n\nStarting (perhaps) from the 60th year (hence 1939) after the founding of the Ilford photographic company (by Alfred Harman in 1879, as 'Britannia Works'), Ilford Limited held formal Dinners to celebrate their milestones of existence. The book 'Silver by the Ton' tells us (p68) Ilford Limited celebrated its Diamond Jubilee on 28th January 1939 with a Dinner at the Trocadero Restaurant in London.\n\nThe 70th year Anniversary was held on 12th November 1948 at the Cafe Royal, Regent Street, London, W.1.\n\nI have generously received (April 2023) one of the actual invitations to that Dinner and it can be seen here or by clicking on the image alongside.\n\nThe 75th anniversary celebration was held in May 1954.\n\n1949\n\nGeneral release of 'Advocate' Series 1 camera with 35mm f4.5 Dallmeyer bloomed lens, shutter 1/25, 1/50, 1/100, 1/200 and B. £22.11s.6d (£22.58p).\n\nIlford Colour Film Type \"A\" introduced. Amateur Photographer magazine for 30th November has a Wallace Heaton advert which prices 35mm Ilford daylight Type 'D' colour film in 18 (half length) exposure cassettes at 16s/4d (82p) and 20 exposure Type 'A' cassettes at 18s/6d (92.5p), including processing. Postage extra 4d (1.5p). By 1955 both films were sold in 20 exposure cassettes for 21s/6d (£1.8p), inclusive of processing.\n\nThe 1949 BJPA (p239) carries an announcement of 'Ilford Sellotape'. \"Sellotape is a self-adhesive, clear cellulose tape which adheres firmly to almost any surface. It is strong and pliable, and thus suitable for many sealing purposes, and other darkroom and studio uses. Sellotape is supplied in rolls, 8½yds in length by 5/8inch wide, in a metal dispenser which can be carried in the pocket and into which refill rolls can easily be loaded. The top of this container allows the required length of Sellotape to be torn off with either a straight or a saw toothed edge. The price of the dispenser, complete with a roll of Sellotape, is 2s.(10p), plus purchase tax; refill rolls cost 1s.(5p) each, plus purchase tax.\"\n\nMy thanks to D.M for pointing out this entry.\n\nRelease of the Ilford 'Craftsman', a simple 120 or 620 roll film reflex finder roll film camera, with 1/25th, 1/75th sec & 'B' shutter + f9 & f18 apertures.

Between Ourselves, December 1955. Between Ourselves, September 1959. 1951 14th March, the company formally changed its name from Ilford, Limited to Ilford Limited (omitting the comma) although in practice the comma had been omitted frequently over many years (my thanks to Gavin Ritchie for this item).\n\nThe Ilford 'Prentice' first appeared, a basic 120 Roll Film folding camera very similar to the Kershaw Penguin.\n\nThe Prentice cost £3.13s.6d plus £1.11s.1d purchase tax (£5.23p).\n\nAt this time, a 120 roll film cost around 2s/7d (13p).\n\n'Picture Beautiful Britain' leaflet describing the Ilford Film range in the run up to the 'Festival of Britain' May to September 1951. Recommended films were HP3, FP3 and PanF for 35mm cameras (125, 64 and 16ASA respectively) and Selochrome orthochromatic roll film (80ASA).\n\n\"This year, when more people than ever will be taking photographs of places visited and of the friends with whom they will share the enjoyment of the Festival celebration, increasing numbers of discriminating amateur photographers will be putting their trust in Ilford films.\"\n\n\"Pageantry, in which this country excels, will play an important part in the Festival of Britain celebrations and will provide a photographic story of tremendous interest.\"\n\nIn 1951, Ilford Australia Pty Ltd, was set up in West Melbourne, Australia, originally with a staff of about 10.\n\nBy 1955 (see below) the company had expanded and was relocated to a site 3 or 4 miles from Mount Waverley called Notting Hill. The Notting Hill factory was occupied until 2003. 1952\n\nThis 20 page booklet entitled Ilford Colour Films was published by Ilford Limited, Ilford, London, around February 1952 (?, based upon the rear cover printer's number ICF/B52/PLH). It describes the principles of additive and subtractive colour processes and determination of exposure under daylight & artificial light for the 10ASA Ilford Colour Films type D and A.\n\nThe text predates the 1953 announcement of an Ilford service to provide colour prints from transparancies as the end-note in italics says \"Ilford Ltd does not undertake the preparation of colour prints or black & white prints from transparencies, or the preparation of duplicate transparencies.\" To view a PDF scan of a leaflet describing Colour Films A & D, see the 1956 chronology 'slot'.\n\nIn 1952 Ilford and Geigy set up Gyl Chemicals Ltd to manufacture Hydroquinone.\n\nIlford introduce high speed HPS plates in time for press work during the 1953 Coronation Year. HPS was introduced as the fastest plate in the world. They were rated at 400 ASA including a speed safety factor (printed on the box) or 800 ASA if you ignored the factor\n\nMichael Talbert comments \"In 1973, when I was working for as an assistant to a photographer in Canterbury as his B/W printer, he happened to mention that he used HPS plates from the time of their 1952 introduction. At that time, he told me, the first boxes of plates came with a label advising, because of their very high speed, that the plates had to be used within a certain time, ( I forget how long, maybe it was around 3 months), or the speed of the plates would gradually diminish. . Later on Ilford managed to hold the speed at 800 ASA for the normal keeping time\", as with their HPS film emulsions.\n\n.I believe this story is true because the early 1960s instruction sheets for Ilford ID 11 and ID 48 developers contained a note re: the developing times of HPS plates, recommending that they should be developed in Microphen. If ID 11 was used, the exposures should be doubled, and with ID 48 the exposures should be trebled. This only applied to HPS plates and not the HPS film emulsions introduced in 1954. ID 48 was the same kind of developer as Kodak Microdol X, not identical but gave extremely fine grain.\n\nThe same Canterbury photographer thought that HPS plates were HP3 plates which had been hypersensitized, a technique dating back to the 1930s for increasing the speed of any emulsion.\n\nAbout a year later Kodak introduced Kodak Press Special, P 2000 plates, rated at 500 ASA incl. a speed safety factor, with 1000 ASA a workable speed. I am sure they had the same trouble as Ilford in maintaining the speed of these plates as D76 wasn't the recommended developer. Kodak Press Contrast or D 61A gave the full 1000 ASA. By the early 1960s P 2000 had quietly disappeared; Kodak's Royal X Pan film took its place from autumn 1958 with an official daylight speed of 650ASA, but Kodak encouraged its use at 1600ASA and even higher with extended development.\n\nThe box of 12 off 4\" x 5\" HPS plates illustrated probably dates from after 1956 because the three speed ratings are:\n\nIlford Meter 37°, Ilford Speed Group H, Weston meter 400. These three speeds are compatible with the speed of 400ASA, but prior to 1956 the Weston meter calibration was not the same as ASA; it would have been 320 Weston (see here). The box shows 400 Weston which indicates the package dates post-1956, after Weston came into line with ASA (now ISO).

He started by working in commercial and industrial fields and then spent some time in the motion-picture and photofinishing industries before joining Ilford Limited to establish a colour processing laboratory. Subsequently he became Head of Technical Services for the Ilford Group and then Technical Advisor to the Head of Marketing. He authored 'The Focal Guide to Colour Printing from Negatives & Slides', 'Colour Prints', 'Focal Guide to Cibachrome' and 'Monochrome Darkroom Practice', as well as being an occasional contributor to Amateur Photographer magazine. Paul Godfrey tells me Jack also authored 'The Illustrated History of Colour Photography' in 1994, a good read which describes various processes including Autochrome and Dufay and continuing through Agfa, Kodak and Ilford.\n\nIlford Photographic Materials General Catalogue. Contents are arranged as a series of booklet sections, in a loose-leaf binder cover, enabling the indivdual sections to be replaced and updated. Probably for use by dealers, as in the back are pages entitled \"Terms of business in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland\".\n\nApparently produced regularly during the 1950s and into the 1960s for trade distribution (e.g see 1955). Thanks to David Muggleton for the loan of this copy.\n\n1953 The Ilford 'Witness' camera finally reaches the mass market, but only some 350 are ever produced. It failed against competition from the newly released Leica M3 and problems with its mass production. In April 1953 the Witness was priced at £121.16s.8d (£121.83p) with a f1.9 lens.\n\nIlford PIM (Photographic Instrument Manufacturers) Monorail professional plate camera with a triangular-section rail marketed by Ilford Ltd (see picture).\n\nComing from the work started in 1948, the year of 1953 saw the launch of a service to provide colour prints from transparencies, both from Ilford's Colour \"D\" transparency film (launched in 1948) and also from Kodachrome. This was the operation that Jack Coote had been hired to manage (see 1952 'slot', above) and was based in Richmond (Surrey, UK). Ciba independently chose to use the same process to formulate the eventual industry leading Cibachrome process. Cibachrome enabled professionals and home workers to make excellent colour prints directly from colour transparencies.\n\nBased upon a reversal process yielding a positive print direct from a positive transparency, print production quickly rose to more than a million prints per annum. The service was only available to 35mm slide film users. Prints 5½\"x3¾\" with a white border. Price per print was 2/6d (12.5p) with a minimum order of four prints from one or more transparencies.\n\nRelease of Envoy Box, Series 1 (?not sure of this year date?) Release of Ilford 'Advocate' camera Series 2, with 35mm f3.5 Dallmeyer bloomed lens and flash synchronised, priced at £26.17s.6d (£26.88p). In this Coronation Year of Princess Elizabeth as Queen Elizabeth II, Mount Everest was finally conquered. The exploration team used Advocate cameras to record their climb, a ready made scoop for Ilford's advertising department.\n\n'Multigrade' variable contrast printing paper re-introduced May 1953.\n\nThis third version of Multigrade had 3 filters, all yellow. Two paper sufaces were available, glossy and velvet stipple.\n\nDated March 1953 but perhaps not printed until Nov 1953 (K53 on end page), this 68 page Ilford textbook was the 14th Edition of the \"Ilford formulae book\", presumably following the tradition set by the 1937 example, shown above. This version was titled \"Formulae & Packed Chemicals\" to reflect the change from photographers mixing their own solutions from basic chemicals to the use of pre-packaged chemical mixtures, merely requiring to be dissolved into stock, or working strength, solutions before use.\n\nPhenidone (see 1940 entry above), \"a remarkable new developing agent produced in the Ilford research laboratories, is mentioned in the book for the first time.\" Although first prepared in 1890 and its developing properties discovered in 1940, large scale manufacturing of the compound did not become feasible until 1951.\n\nDevelopers are now ID-1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 19, 20 (Phenidone & Metol versions), 22, 33, 34, 36 (Phenidone and Metol versions), 42, 46, 47, 48, 55, 60, 61, 62 & 66. Pre-packaged developers include Contrast FF, Document paper (ID-55), Formalith, PFP (ID-62) and PQ Universal. Book also describes various fixers, hardeners, stop-baths, reducers, intensifiers, toners and packed chemicals.\n\nTo view the first 25 pages, which cover the Ilford Developers, click here or on the image. Booklet owned by David Muggleton.\n\nTo view an instruction sheet on the use and processing of FP3 and HP3 roll films, dated October 1953, click here.\n\nBooklet similar to that shown in the 1955 'slot' (below) but unlike the later booklet, this one is clearly identifiable as November 1953 by the normal Ilford dating system on the back cover (J53).\n\nIntended for use by retailers to show the general public the range of Ilford items available. Each booklet would bear the name of the dealer and no doubt dealers would give copies away to regular customers for them to browse at home. Packed with information within its 74 illustrated pages. Note the cover has the Ilford text logo of the time \"for faces and places\".\n\nMy thanks to David Muggleton for this copy.\n\nHPS Sheet Film (Cut Film) box dating from the mid-1950s.\n\nHPS sheet film was introduced in 1953, a year after HPS plates, making it the fastest sheet film in the world at that time at 400 Weston (=ASA=ISO; but only after introduction of the Weston Master III in 1956). The 400 Weston included a Safety Factor of one stop, and experienced photographers processing their own films could safely expose HPS at 800 ASA (ISO) when using the Ilford developers ID-2 or ID-11, but not ID-48. ID-48 was an Extra Fine Grain developer, and its extra fine grain development decreased the emulsion speed by half a stop. A further gain in speed was possible by developing the film in Ilford Microphen developer when the film speed could be increased to 1,200ASA (ISO). Some photographers found they could expose at even higher speeds with extended development times in Microphen depending on the amount of shadow detail required.\n\nTo view an enlarged image, click here or on the image.\n\nManufacture of HPS film in all formats ceased by 1971, but it was still possible to find out dated boxes of HPS sheet film offered for sale at surplus photographic material dealers, such as A.W. Young, Marston and Heard, plus others, in the late 1970s.\n\nIt is believed the highest speed film on the market prior to HPS was Eastman Kodak's Super Panchro Press  Sports Type, a sheet film with an ASA (ISO) speed of 250. The 250 rating included the usual (for the time) Safety Factor of one stop, such that its true speed was 500ASA (ISO). \"Super Panchro Press - Sports Type\" was only made in sheet film format and was only available in the USA.\n\n1954\n\nIlford HPS roll film (120 size) and 35mm film introduced \"the fastest film in the world\" (plates had been introduced in 1952 & Cut Sheet Film in 1953 - see above).\n\nFast panchromatic, 400ASA in daylight, 320ASA in tungsten light. The speed revision of 1960 raised the speed to 800ASA.\n\nPrice; 127 film 3s/1d (15.5p; equivalent to £4.34 in 2020), 120 & 620 film 3s/5d (17p; equivalent to £4.81 in 2020) & 36exp 35mm cassette 9s/2d (46p; equivalent to £12.90 in 2020).\n\nTo view more HPS packaging images, click here.\n\nHPS was still available as conventional still camera film stock (roll & 35mm) up to the late-1960s. Processing details for roll and 35mm versions last appear in the Johnsons Year Book for 1969. After 1969, HPS only appears in the Johnson Year Book as 'narrow gauge cine film'. It continues to appear as cine film up to 1971, when the Year Book was last sold.\n\nKodak's equivalent 'no compromise fast film' Royal X Pan, was available (in the UK) from 1958 (speed up to 1600ASA) as 120 roll film. It was still available retail into the early 1970s. This site shows a roll of Royal X Pan with an expiry date of 1976, suggesting it was still being made in, say, 1972-73. In 1970 it was priced around 6s.9d (34p) per roll, nearly double the price in 1958.\n\nThanks to Roger Gittins for directing me to a copy of the Ilford House Magazine for May 1954.\n\nIt was found on Martin Reed's previous Silverprint website. Martin now runs a website called Darkside.\n\nThe picture illustrates the type of card slide mount used by Ilford for their Colour D transparency film in 1954. Plain white on the reverse.\n\nThe picture was taken on the beach at Weston-Super-Mare in the summer of 1954.\n\nBJPA publishing arrangements: In Amateur Photographer magazine for 24th March 1954 there is an announcement, within the advertisement by R.G.Lewis Ltd. (125 Strand, London, W.C.2.), saying:\n\n\"Every year, the B.J.Almanac is published in a limited edition and it contains in its 600 pages interesting articles by renowned experts, descriptions of new methods, materials, processes, formulae etc. In both professional and amateur photographic circles it is regarded as the book of the year. Every page, even the coloured advertisements, is covered with useful information that sooner or later needs to be referred to. Publication is expected at the end of this month and in view of the usual heavy demand we shall be glad to reserve your copy now, upon receipt of remittance. Linson Board Covers, 5/- (25p); Cloth Bound, 7/6d (37.5p). Postage 8d. (3p) each.\"\n\nThis indicates that (in 1954 at least) publication was in early spring, but it contained information relevant to the previous 12 months. Hence, the 1954 B.J.P.A held information relevant to 1953.

A scan of a June 1955 Ilford leaflet describing their \"colour prints from transparencies\" service is available here (courtesy of Paul Godfrey). It predates the black and white negative service and duplicate slide service.\n\nIlford Photographic Materials General Catalogue; a substantial 233mm x 157mm hard backed 328 page book, apparently produced regularly during the 1950s and into the 1960s for trade distribution. Doug McKee tells me that his 1956 copy has 336 pages.\n\nAround 1955 (see AP Jan 1956, article by J.Rufus), HP3 film speed increased to 200ASA (post-1960 to 400ASA). This speed increase was fortunate because in 1955 the famous Kodak Tri-X roll film appeared - first on the Continent, later in the UK. It subsequently also became available as 35mm.\n\n\"Tri-X was once one of the most popular films used by photojournalists and many amateurs.\"\n\nIn 1955, Ilford Australia Pty Ltd was relocated to a site called Notting Hill. This factory was occupied until 2003. The site may have been purchased around 1953 (see p81: Silver by the Ton).\n\nNotting Hill is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 19 km south-east of Melbourne's central business district.\n\nAlexander Paterson Downie was the Managing Director of Ilford Australia Pty Ltd from early in the formation of the Notting Hill laboratory site (perhaps from 1955) until his retirement in 1966 (my thanks to Alex Downie's daughter, Mary Hildebrandt, for this information). After Alex Downie retired, it is possible the Managing Director was W.J.Kemp (ref: p83; \"Silver by the Ton\").\n\nMary Hildebrandt tells me:\n\n\"Notting Hill is not far away from Mount Waverley (about 3 or 4 miles). The area where the factory was located, on the corner of Forsters and Ferntree Gully Roads was appropriately opposite a local icon The Notting Hill Hotel, run by the wonderful Kath Byer. This meant it was an excellent situation to build a factory of any sort. Monash University is very nearby and the Nott has been part of the academia of that university for a long time. They walked across a paddock to get to the bar. Old Charlie Forster owned a lot of land in the area and was a successful orchardist. He and Dad (Alex Downie) were great friends and some of Charlies staff worked at Ilford for many years. He would be amazed if he knew how much that land is worth now, millions !!!\"\n\nClick here to view some pictures of the Notting Hill site in Australia, sent to me by David J Arnold, who works for the Australia and New Zed Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), which is located on a site adjacent to where Ilford, Notting Hill, used to be situated. David's pictures date back to the time when Ilford first began to operate from there, through to the site's demolition in 2006.\n\nMarc Payet, who used to be National Sales Manager of the Australian ILFORD subsidiary, has told me it actually closed in 2005 and a distributor was appointed - CR Kennedy & Company Pty Ltd.\n\nMarc now (2014) works as National Sales Manager for CR Kennedy & Company Pty Ltd at 300 Lorimer Street, Port Melbourne 3207, Victoria, Australia.\n\nA 2nd edition version of the Printing and Enlarging booklet shown previously (see 1947). This version includes mention of Multigrade paper. Multigrade had been temporarily withdrawn from sale before the time of the 1947 booklet but was marketed again from 1953, in time to appear in this 1955 booklet.\n\nAs with the 1947 version, there is enclosed within the rear cover fold, a separate sample 'book' of paper surfaces from the Bromide, Plastika, Contact and Multigrade paper ranges.\n\nInterestingly, the price charged for this 1955 booklet (now slightly larger at 52 pages) remained at 2s/6d (13.5p).\n\nThe booklet has been donated to me by Cezar Popescu, who lives in Romania. Thanks to Cezar for sending me the booklet and also for making available a pdf of all its contents; Click the image or here.\n\nA similar set of Bromide, Plastika and Contact paper samples can be see here, courtesy of Michael Talbert.\n\nThis 96 page 120mm x 185mm booklet entitled Ilford Photographic Materials & Accessories 'for faces & places', is undated, but is believed relates to late 1955 (maybe early 1956) as it predates the release of Colour Film Type F in 1956, but post-dates the release of HPS roll & 35mm film in 1954.\n\nIt was perhaps aimed more at the amateur market than the hard back General Catalogue illustrated above. The back cover has a space for a retailer to stamp his shop's name & address (though the example shown bears no such stamp) and such a retailer might have given copies to regular customers to encourage them to browse at home and select further purchases from his shop.\n\nThe name FP4 first appeared as a plate emulsion (a name"
