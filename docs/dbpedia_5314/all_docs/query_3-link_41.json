From the moment you arrive, you’ll be immersed in a full slate of experiences and exclusive events that reflect an expansive expression of theater within the breathtaking natural beauty of the Berkshires.\n\nYou’ll start your time with a welcoming experience that will both ground and orient you for what’s to come. Depending on when you arrive, you then may find yourself at a dining experience, or a show. Or both. Either way, you’ll end your night with a Night Cap. Over the course of the weekend, you may find yourself at an outdoor concert, a live taping of a popular podcast, a world-premiere play, an outdoor community happening, a burlesque-inspired variety performance – a full schedule of expansive programming. No matter what, we won’t send you home without a proper sendoff and an understanding of what you can come to expect from the Festival as it transforms into its next chapter. You’ll have to experience it to know it.\n\nWTF IS NEXT PROGRAMMING:\n\nKICKOFF:\n\nSarah Kay\n\nThursday, August 1 at 4:00 PM & Friday, August 2 at 4:00 PM\n\nat The Festival Stage at ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance (1000 Main St, Williamstown,\n\nMA 01267)\n\nSarah Kay has shared her poems in cornfields in Iowa, an orthodontist’s office in Nepal, a ship on a fjord in Norway, a nightclub in Singapore, the Royal Danish Theatre in Denmark, Carnegie Hall in New York City, the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, the back rooms of dive-bars, middle school gymnasiums and once on top of someone’s dining room table. Now, she’s electrifying the Festival stage with a spoken word performance that blends the heart with the mind and brings poetry to life.\n\nDINNER EXPERIENCE:\n\nStoryCourse\n\nBy Adam Kantor\n\nThursday, August 1 at 5:30 PM & Friday, August 2 at 5:30 PM\n\nat The Williams Inn Ballroom (101 Spring Street, Williamstown, MA 01267)\n\nStoryCourse is where theater and food come together. A multi-chapter, multi-course, interactive, and narrative dining experience where the story informs the menu and the menu informs the story, StoryCourse breaks down the walls between the kitchen and the dining room, between strangers sitting together at a table, between chefs and the mouths they feed, between experience and possibility. Created for and with the Williamstown community by Adam Kantor (The Band’s Visit) with special collaborators, this is a StoryCourse experience you won’t be able to have anywhere else.\n\nStoryCourse is included for WTF IS NEXT Passholders. Buy individual tickets to StoryCourse here.\n\nNIGHT CAP:\n\nOpen Mic Night\n\nCreated and Performed by Peter Mills Weiss and Julia Mounsey\n\nThursday, August 1 at 10:00 PM & Friday, August 2 at 10:00 PM\n\nThe Directing Studio at ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance (1000 Main St, Williamstown,\n\nMA 01267)\n\nAn experimental theater piece about the end of an experimental theater. As one-time proprietors of Brooklyn’s late and much-lamented DIY space Life World, Peter Mills Weiss and Julia Mounsey have already lived through the artist’s pain of building up and then losing a scene. A long goodbye to an imaginary experimental theater, Open Mic Night’s (New York Times Critic’s Pick) recursions and subversions reveal the easy fellowship that comes from mixing dark rooms, cheap beer, and a small crowd facing the same direction.\n\nOpen Mic Night is included for WTF IS NEXT Passholders. Buy individual tickets to Open Mic Night here.\n\nMORNING SHOW:\n\nBritton & The Sting Unplugged\n\nFriday, August 2 at 10:00 AM\n\nThe Reflecting Pool at The Clark Institute (225 South St, Williamstown, MA 01267)\n\nThrough the testimony and mesmerizing grooves of gospel, alternative rock, and soul, Britton & The Sting creates an intimate, sacred gathering to uncover just how tethered we are to the element of water. Like water, in what ways do we boil, flood, rain, and renew ourselves?\n\nThis 45-minute experience features original music, personal testimony, and dialogue about the creation process, vision, and future of the full-length piece, MAMA. Why is a funk liberation band writing music about water? What is the relationship between spirituality and this work? How does Britton’s identity as a Black, queer Southerner living in Brooklyn influence this new creation?\n\nBritton & The Sting Unplugged will be a standing event; it is included for WTF IS NEXT Passholders.

Water. For billions of years, she has reigned as our planet’s most essential element of life. Across our differences, she is MAMA.\n\nThrough testimony and mesmerizing grooves of gospel, alternative rock, and soul, Britton & The Sting creates a sacred gathering of community to uncover just how tethered we are to Mama and why. In what ways do we boil, flood, rain, and renew ourselves like her? In this era of great divide, oppression, empathetic drought, what does Mama want to remind us as we reach towards evolution and salvation?\n\nThis 70-minute experience invites its audience to participate as a unique congregation of seekers. Britton & The Sting creates an environment of joy, reflection, and curiosity so that we may each experience the benefits of radical sanctuary to align with the purpose of this sacred element within ourselves and each other.\n\nOriginally commissioned, developed, and produced by Little Island. www.littleisland.org.\n\nMAMA is part of the WTF IS NEXT 4-Day Pass.
