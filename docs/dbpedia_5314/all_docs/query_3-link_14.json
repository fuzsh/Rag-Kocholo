But it is Flask-WTF (maybe we need a synonym?).\n\nDon't confuse it with WTF ORMs.\n\nIt appears to be a Python library:\n\nWTForms is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for python web development.\n\nOf course, the name may be the source of some of these questions. You need to have:\n\nfrom wtforms import Form, BooleanField, StringField, validators\n\nnot:\n\nfrom wtfforms import Form, BooleanField, StringField, validators\n\nWhile we can all mock them for their poor name, the tag is perfectly on-topic for Stack Overflow.\n\nLike any other spelling mistake (java script is a particularly annoying one), the posts should be edited to fix the errors. You have 2k+ rep, so you are as able as anyone to do so."
