When people say \"the FAQ\", they are generally referring to a list of answers to Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nFTFY\n\nFixed that for you; often accompanied by a correction\n\nFTW For the win FWIW For what it's worth FYI For your information HTH Hope this helps IANAL I am not a lawyer IIRC If I recall correctly IMHO In my humble opinion IMNSHO In my not so humble opinion IMO In my opinion IOW In other words l33t or 1337\n\nFrom \"elite\". This has become a term used to describe the informal communication of Internet gaming.

The question you have asked is clearly answered in the manual and you are wasting time asking people to read it to you.\" It's good netiquette to mail this type of answer to another user rather than post it in public messages.\n\nTBH To be honest TLA Three letter acronym TTFN Ta ta for now W/E Whatever w00t An expression of joy WFN Wrong forum, noob WTF What the heck WYSIWYG YMMV Your mileage may vary {g} Grin"
