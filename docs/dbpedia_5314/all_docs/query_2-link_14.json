        "text": "By Amy Westfeldt | Associated Press\n\nThe Freedom Tower is out. One World Trade Center is in.\n\nThe signature skyscraper rising at ground zero to replace the fallen twin towers was first named the Freedom Tower in the first master plan to rebuild the site of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. State officials said the name of the tallest, most symbolic of five planned office towers would demonstrate the country's triumph over terrorism.\n\nOfficials heading the agency that owns the site confirmed Thursday that the name had long ago taken second place to its official title: One World Trade Center.\n\n\"As we market the building, we will ensure that the building is presented in the best possible way,\" said Anthony Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \"One World Trade Center is its address. It's the one that we're using. It's the one that's easiest for people to identify with and frankly, we've gotten a very interested and warm reception to it.\"\n\nOne World Trade Center - which was once the name for the north trade center tower - has been the 1,776-foot tower's legal name for the past few years, although officials more commonly called the building the Freedom Tower.\n\nThe first 25-ton steel column for the building was installed in 2006, emblazoned with the words \"Freedom Tower.\" The name was also on a granite cornerstone set into place at the tower's first groundbreaking in 2004, though it has since been taken off the site.\n\nA release announcing the first corporate tenant to sign a lease in the tower referred to the building as \"One World Trade Center (the Freedom Tower).\"\n\nThe agency's executive director, Chris Ward, suggested that the building's true name wouldn't be decided until well after it opens in 2013.\n\n\"There are a lot of buildings that have popular names,\" he said. \"If the Freedom Tower is a popular name, as people think about this that will be the choice.\"\n\n×\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCopyright License\n\nUse of this Website is subject to the terms of this disclaimer and by using the Website, you agree to these terms.
