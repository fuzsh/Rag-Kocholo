        "text": "Hi, our team has been working on a private project in Roboflow and this weekend I logged in to take a peek and export the data locally and we can’t as we don’t have enough export credits?\n\nWe’re not asking for resizes, nor generations, nor anything besides source images and annotations… but it won’t let us export the dataset as we’re over the undisclosed 5,000 generated image limit? Our dataset is 637 images labeled. How is this no where on the pricing page?\n\nThere is very little chance of us upgrading even thought the budget is approved. We’ve been relatively happy users of Roboflow (the lack of image rotation is silly) but this is the deal that breaks the camel’s back.\n\nWe can’t get our data out. We played with the augmentations (which don’t work for our needs) and somehow that was against our 5,000 generated image credits that are disclosed nor displayed nowhere in the interface.\n\nIf you are evaluating Roboflow, just know there is 0 chance you’ll speak to support and they just direct you here.\n\nAll of the good will they build via their youtube channel, tools, and very aggressive SEO strategy are thrown out the window for us by not disclosing a limit and forcing you to use an export tool. Serious WTF moment.\n\nHow do we know this sort of data hostage won’t be pulled on us as soon as we upgrade… is there another undisclosed limit?"
