        "text": "WTF is a profane slang expression that teenagers use to express exasperation, irritation, or incredulity. The abbreviation is considered less offensive than saying the actual words that it stands for. Another way to express the thought in a manner that is milder is to use the military code, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.\n\nExamples of how your teen might use the slang term WTF:\n\n-Mark said the bridge is open and he’s going to be really late.\n\n-wtf man? Everybody knows the bridge opens on the hour during the summer.\n\n-Mr. Brown assigned a four-page essay plus we have to have our Reader’s Notebook ready to upload.\n\n-WTF!!!\n\n-Red Springs beat Loganville by 46 points!\n\n-wtf\n\n-Michael said he “lost” ALL the broccoli.\n\n-WTF?\n\nYou might learn your child is using this slang term by chance when a text pops up on the phone screen. But while the slang term WTF is usually harmless, other teenage slang terms could indicate that your teen is talking about risky behaviors or communicating with potentially dangerous people.\n\nHaving a parental control app on your child’s phone will give you peace of mind by alerting you to your child’s exposure to risks encountered on their phone. With a parental control app installed on your child’s phone, you have the control to set alerts to help your teen avoid the pitfalls of predators, drug dealers, and other negative influences. Having the ability to vary the level of monitoring gives you the power to choose what is right for your child, and these levels can easily be adjusted at any time."
