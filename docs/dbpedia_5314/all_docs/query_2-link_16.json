        "text": "The Oculus is home to 12 subway lines, the World Trade Center PATH station, and dozens of retailers, serving over a million people every week.\n\nThe main floor bustles with commuters, shoppers, and visitors, plus weekly programs, from farmers' markets and art exhibits to musical performances and retail events.\n\nThe Oculus has access points across the entire 16-acre World Trade Center campus, including private entries into commercial office towers (One World Trade Center, 3 World Trade Center, and 4 World Trade Center) and connects to Brookfield Place through the West Concourse.\n\nCheck out our Getting Here page for more information on traveling to and through the Transportation Hub.\n\nThe Oculus and Transportation Hub are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. World Trade Center retail is leased and operated by the private entity Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield. Learn more about Shopping and Dining at the Oculus.\n\nThe Oculus was positioned as part of the World Trade Center masterplan by Daniel Libeskind and designed by Santiago Calatrava. The structure’s white metal-clad steel ribs reach up and out in a monumental move symbolic of a hand releasing a dove.\n\nThe structure's orientation serves as a lasting reminder of the attacks of September 11, 2001. It is in alignment with the sun’s solar angles on each September 11, from 8:46 am, when the first plane struck, until 10:28 am, when the second tower collapsed. Its central skylight fits this alignment and washes the Oculus floor with a beam of light."
