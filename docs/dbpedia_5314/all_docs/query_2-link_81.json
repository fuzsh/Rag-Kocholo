Points are given based on a team's performance in a Test rather than a series. If a match is 'dead rubber' where the result of a series match is predecided, points are evenly split between playing teams.\n\nIn a five-match series, 20 per cent of the points would be accessible each match, whereas 50 per cent of the points would be available each match in a two-match series. The ICC also agreed that a tie is worth half a victory, and a draw is worth a third of a win. According to the points system of the ICC World Test Championship:\n\nA team receives 12 points and 100% in case of a win.\n\nA team receives 4 points and 33.33% in case of a draw.\n\nA team receives 6 points and 50% in case of a tie.\n\nA team receives 0 points if they lose the match\n\nMore Current Affairs Topics\n\nCricket World Cup Winners ListMost International CenturiesCSK Players ListAsia Cup Winners ListSyed Mushtaq Ali TrophyT20 World Cup Points TableRanji Trophy Winners ListDouble Century In ODIMost Double Centuries In Test CricketMost Centuries In T20\n\nFAQs on World Test Championship Winners\n\nQ1.
