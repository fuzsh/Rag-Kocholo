        "text": "I heard somewhere that LOUD went more for ''chemestry'' with the team when picking players rather than actual big impact duelists names in the scenario, and QCK had a good result and because saadhak already knew that 3 years ago qck was a decent duelist and could do flex too now, fucking unlucky for us i guess.\n\nIndeed they did. But to be fair they were at least better with dgzin. He was the carry for them, and now they suck even more without a \"carry\" type of player.\n\nFuria 2023 was decent, they were 1 match away from qualifying for the masters and champs but they lose to Loud\n\nthey didnt suck ass tho, looking back now FURIA games in americas league was pretty decent last year, they at least won alot of maps and played way better together. Shame what happen after LCQ."
