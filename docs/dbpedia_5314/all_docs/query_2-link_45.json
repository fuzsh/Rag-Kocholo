        "text": "On May 7, BCCI announced a 20-man squad for Team India's forthcoming Tests assignments, i.e. the ICC World Test Championship final versus New Zealand, which will be followed by five Tests against England in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile the squad comprised a good balance with all-rounders, spinners and pacers, what surprised many that Virat Kohli-led India picked up as many as four spinners for the English conditions, generally more akin to pace and swing. R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar and Axar Patel have been named as the four frontline spinners for the long and gruelling English summer, whereas Hanuma Vihari can also bowl some off-spin if needed.\n\nDecoding the reason and thinking behind having four spinners in the squad, former all-rounder Reetinder Singh Sodhi feels captain Kohli's thought process changed with regards to his spinners after the Australia tour.\n\n\"I feel Virat Kohli's thinking changed after the Australia tour. The theory that if your bowler can bat has proved effective\" said Sodhi during an interaction with India News. \"If we talk about Washington Sundar and Ashwin's batting in Australia, I think they were pivotal there. They changed the match there and we created history. So, somewhere or the other we are seeing in this selection that the selectors have given weightage to the bowlers who can bat and are all-rounders,\" Sodhi added.\n\nMoreover, India will play England during the second half of the year, which can see more turn on the English surfaces. Also, a four-month-long tour of the United Kingdom, starting with the WTC final, may have forced the team management to add more to their spin and pace department in order to manage their players' workload.\n\nIn the India-England home series, it was Ashwin and Axar who ran riot and combined to account for 59 scalps in the four Tests. While not exactly the same conditions can be expected in England and Wales, India will still like to attack with their spinners knowing England's weakness against them.\n\nIndia play New Zealand in the WTC final, in mid-June at The Rose Bowl, Southampton, before their five-match Test series versus England, from August-September.\n\nSquad: Virat Kohli (C), Ajinkya Rahane (VC), Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Umesh Yadav\n\nKL Rahul and Wriddhiman Saha's inclusion is subjected to fitness"
