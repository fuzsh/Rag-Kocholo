        "text": "Bonsoir !\n\nI've often come across wtf and I've seen that it means what the freak or what the fuck.\n\nMore generally, I've seen what the freak/fuck are you doing ? but what does it mean ? I think it might be translated by qu'est-ce que tu fais/fous ? but I've seen it in so many situations that I believe it might have other meanings.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nBonsoir !\n\nI've often come across wtf and I've seen that it means what the freak or what the fuck. This is a very vulgar form of zut alors\n\nMore generally, I've seen what the freak/fuck are you doing ? but what does it mean ? I think it might be translated by qu'est-ce que tu fais/fous ? but I've seen it in so many situations that I believe it might have other meanings.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nThis is considered very foul language.\n\nIt's actually not VERY foul language, especially online. It's less vulgar than \"what the fuck\" in speech. Acronyms and spelling changes tend to de-vulgarize things to an extent.\n\nSometimes it can mean \"qu'est-ce que tu fais\" but it really depends on the context. Other things it can possibly mean that I can think of:\n\n- why the fuck (are you doing this)?\n\n- that's stupid\n\n- I can't believe it\n\n- I don't understand\n\n- you don't make sense\n\n- you're wrong\n\n- etc.\n\nyes but bordel ou merdier relate to something physical sur as a teenagerr's room that had been ranksacked by an infernous tribe from another galaxy …\n\nWhereas \"what the fuck is this …\" depends of what you add after this syntagm : for instance \"what the fuck this argument means ?… \" would most probably be translated by \"c'est quoi cet argument foireux / argument de merde ?…\" … Hence \"what the fuck is this … \" is more open than \"bordel\" ou \"merdier\" … All depends on the context.\n\nWhat the fuck? stands by itself as an interjection. While it is obviously an abbreviation of \"What the fuck is this?\", \"What the fuck is going on?\" etc, by itself it expresses a state of bewilderment and/or exasperation, but not necessarily a question. In other words the person who says it may already know full well what is going on, but may be struggling to adjust their world view to accommodate it.\n\nThe phrase is very much a North American one, although I imagine it is spreading into British English (particularly as \"wtf\") due to its use on the Internet. It is one of the few North American English expressions I brought back with me from Canada because I really don't think British English has an equivalent.\n\nIn Québec the English expression is sometimes used (I don't know how popular it is) and is sometimes (I'm not sure how often) spelled playfully \"ouate de phoque\" (seal cotton wool/seal cotton).\n\nthat's why (I'm answering to the argument that wtf stands by itself as an interjection) it cannot be always translated by \"c'est quoi ce bordel / ce merdier…\" etc…)\n\nactually it's really close to \"what the hell…\"\n\nIn itself I would translate it by an interjection such as : \"oh ! … merde … \"\n\n\"ah ben ça alors … \" on simply as \"hein ???…\" \"quoi ?…\" (althouth this has an english equivalent : \"whaaat ???…\")\n\nAll other feedback are most welcomed as, at this very moment, I have very little imagination for translating into slang …\n\nThis is definitely true! In English you can be offensive with one word - in French the words themselves don't offend as much, so you have to be creative...\n\nI disagree with that. I find French quite richer on that matter. Indeed, the word \"fuck\" seems omnipresent in English offenses while there's no such an obviousness in French.\n\nAnyway, I think what has been proposed \"c'est quoi ce bordel?\" or \"c'est quoi ce merdier,\", and I would add \"c'est quoi ces conneries?\" are great translations.\n\nIn Québec the English expression is sometimes used (I don't know how popular it is) and is sometimes (I'm not sure how often) spelled playfully \"ouate de phoque\" (seal cotton wool/seal cotton).\n\nI confirm its fairly frequent use; stand up comics have riffed on the ouate de phoque theme, so most everybody would be familiar with its use.\n\nIn Québec, we swear using church-related words, so we can definitely be offensive with a single word. Personally, crisse has the same short quick punch of fuck, but emphasizing every syllable of ta-bar-nak yields great satisfaction, too.\n\nBut, acronym-wise, we'd stick with wtf.\n\nI have been teaching myself French and had the privilege of spending the greater part of a year with a French Exchanged student. Whenever we wanted to say \"What the f**k?\" we would say, \"Quoi le phoque?\"(pronounced k-wah le fo[like the french word faux for false]-k) This literally means what the seal(furry animal) but since you wanted something that sounded harshed I think this is the best way for you to say WTF. Ciao. !\n\nWhat the fuck? stands by itself as an interjection. While it is obviously an abbreviation of \"What the fuck is this?\", \"What the fuck is going on?\" etc, by itself it expresses a state of bewilderment and/or exasperation, but not necessarily a question. In other words the person who says it may already know full well what is going on, but may be struggling to adjust their world view to accommodate it.\n\nThe phrase is very much a North American one, although I imagine it is spreading into British English (particularly as \"wtf\") due to its use on the Internet.

I can confirm that yes, in the UK, we do just say 'what the fuck...'\n\nHi, what the fuck is indeed an interjection but depending on the punctuation and context going from, an agressive incomprehension, a quiet soliloquy of incomprehension, and another way saying why not?, the translations can vary widely.\n\nC'est tout à fait vrai, et je me demandais ce qui serait l'équivalent français dans ce sens-ci.\n\nPar exemple la chanson rap de easy e ('easy does it'): \"A dice game started, so I said, 'what the fuck'. So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck\"\n\nEn l'occurrence, peut-on dire, \"donc j'ai dit, et puis merde.\"?\n\nmerci\n\n\"Fuck\" being closest to \"Putain\" in French, I would try to insert it in most occurences of wtf and am surprised hardly anyone used it in their own suggestions, though I have to admit that \"et puis merde\" in the above example works perfectly\n\nSo instead of saying \"C'est quoi ce bordel/merdier ?\" for instance, I would go with \"C'est quoi ce putain de bordel ?\" or \"C'est quoi ça, putain ?!\" Note that you can move \"putain\" at the beginning of the sentence: \" 'Tain c'est quoi ce truc ?!\"\n\nThe often shortened \"What the\" could probably be rendered by \"Oh, putain...\"\n\nAs a interjection \"Putain de merde !\" would work quite well too ^^\n\nI am French. Quebec French, and how we say it is \"ce qui la baise\". I do not know how France does it. But I don't live there. *laughs*\n\n\"Putain\" is \"Slut\" Trust me. Don't go around calling anyone in Quebec that! You'll get beat!!\n\n-English is second language.\n\nI am from Quebec too and Putain and Bordel is said to avoid the more offensive use of religious terms.\n\n\"Putain\" is \"Slut\" Trust me. Don't go around calling anyone in Quebec that! You'll get beat!!\n\nIn France at least, in 99% of cases \"putain\" is not an insult but merely an interjection (like \"damn\" or probably \"crisse\" in Québec), while \"pute\" would be the insult.\n\nI confirm that the use of WTF is commonplace in writing among people under 30.\n\nIn France at least, in 99% of cases \"putain\" is not an insult but merely an interjection (like \"damn\" or probably \"crisse\" in Québec), while \"pute\" would be the insult.\n\nI confirm that the use of WTF is commonplace in writing among people under 30.\n\nJe suis d'accord avec vous - Maudit, putain, bordel - sont des expressions jugées plus ou moins convenables par certains, plutôt comiques par d'autres. Mais ce n'est pas jurer.\n\nEt on dit aussi - C'est une pute! pour insulter quelqu'un - ou fils de pute! (et non putain).\n\nQuestion de culture - les Anglais utilisent le sexe pour jurer. Les Québécois utilisent la religion. Les tabous diffèrent d'une culture à l'autre et devraient être considérés quand on traduit!"
