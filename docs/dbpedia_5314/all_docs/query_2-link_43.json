But beware: too much knowledge on WTF can give the unworthy reader both plaid colored pinkies and rocket diarrhea; a condition in which the afflicted individual fires powerful flames with every act of flatulence sending him or her flying into the air like a rocket.\n\nAbout WTF[]\n\nThe higher power behind all things random and ridiculous is shrouded in mystery, but its devotees are many and hail from powerful races including the TimRexes, the Big Smelly Willies, the Sean Men, The Boogers, the Bootyheads, the Weses, and much more. Many brave buffoons and noble nincompoops from each of these races all traverse the seven WTF Realms in their quest to cause silly shenanigans in the name of WTF itself."
