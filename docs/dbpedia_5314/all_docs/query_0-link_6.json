The NPN is a network of health care providers across the country under contract with the Program to provide care for members who live outside the NY metropolitan area.\n\nOutreach to Potential Members\n\nThe Program performs ongoing outreach to those that may be affected by the 9/11 attacks and may not be aware that the Program is available to them. Outreach is performed by outreach and education partners engaged with the 9/11 community and New York City neighborhoods. We assist our partners through coordination efforts, social media, and communication material development.\n\nOutreach and Education Partners\n\nProgram Videos\n\nOutreach Materials\n\nAbout the Administrator\n\nJohn Howard, MD, serves as Administrator of the WTC Health Program.
