        "text": "Learning a new language isn’t easy, and there is unfortunately no Duolingo Owl for social media acronyms (Duo, if you’re reading this, I’m totally going to practice my Japanese later, please stop texting me). But proper, clever use of internet abbreviations is part of a successful social media strategy — so if your brand is using social media for business, you’re going to want to study up.\n\nImproper use of acronyms online can be confusing at best and embarrassing at worst. You don’t want your company to sound like someone’s great aunt Margy:\n\nSo we’ve put together the ultimate guide to social media acronyms. Read on for a crash course in internet lingo.\n\nNetwork-specific abbreviations\n\nNetwork names\n\nFB: Facebook\n\nG+: Google +\n\nIG: Instagram\n\nLI: LinkedIn\n\nTW: Twitter\n\nYT: YouTube\n\nDM: Direct message\n\nThis is a private form of communication, seen only between the sender and the recipient. On Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, users can “slide into” someone’s DMs by sending a private message.\n\nMT: Modified Tweet\n\nTweets that begin with MT indicate that the Tweeter has edited the content they’re retweeting for brevity or other reasons. This is also called a Quote Tweet.\n\nPM: Private message\n\nPrivate messages are the same as direct messages. If someone asks you to PM them, they’re essentially asking to move a public conversation into the private realm.\n\nPRT: Partial Retweet\n\nThis is very similar to a RT, but is used to show that you’re only quoting part of what the other Twitter user said originally. Maybe you’re condensing to save space for your own commentary, for example.\n\nRT: Retweet\n\nInstead of hitting the retweet button, or retweeting with a comment, some Twitter users repost a tweet and use “RT” plus the user’s handle for attribution.\n\nPopular social media acronyms and abbreviations\n\nAFAIK: As far as I know\n\nUsed when sharing facts or stating something that you believe to be true, but typing AFAIK shows that you aren’t completely sure. You’re not an expert, after all.\n\nAKA: Also known as\n\nThis is a useful abbreviation when referring to folks who literally go by two names (Stefani Germanotta AKA Lady Gaga) or referencing a common nickname (Simone Biles aka the GOAT). Also, see “GOAT.”\n\nAMA: Ask me anything\n\nAMAs are social question-and-answer sessions. Companies, influencers, brand representatives and everyday folks might post AMAs on Twitter, Reddit, or in a Facebook or Instagram live stream.\n\nASAP: As soon as possible\n\nFor when you need something, right now.\n\nBRB: Be right back\n\nThis is one of the original social media abbreviations, first used in the late 1980s or early 1990s. It’s from the chat forum era, but finds its way back on social when the right occasion calls for it.\n\nBTS: Behind the scenes\n\nNope, not the Korean boy band. This abbreviation is used to offer followers a behind-the-scenes look at your brand.\n\n@balletexcelohio\n\nPeter Pan ✨magic✨ #bts #peterpan #flying #balletflex #behindthescenes #fyp\n\n♬ GOOD TIME – Niko Moon\n\nBTW: By the way\n\nThis social media acronym is used to add extra info, go on a tangent, or throw some shade.\n\nCMV: Change my view\n\nYou’re sharing an opinion, but are aware that your opinion might be flawed. You’re open to having a civil conversation. In fact, there’s an entire subreddit dedicated to CMV discussions.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nDYK: Did you know\n\nDid you know the DYK abbreviation is a great way to share a fun fact with your social media audience? Write in your social media caption or include it as a hashtag.\n\nELI5: Explain (it to me) like I’m five\n\nThis social media abbreviation is popular on Reddit, and is a way to request a simple explanation for a complex topic or concept.\n\nFBF: Flashback Friday\n\nA way to throw it back to the past on a Friday.\n\nFOMO: Fear of missing out\n\nIf you haven’t heard of FOMO, you’ve been missing out. This social-bred phobia expresses the anxiety of absence. For the homebodies there’s the antonym acronym JOMO, which means Joy of Missing Out.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JordanDoww/status/1515335522381701147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nFTW: For the win\n\nA sometimes sincere, sometimes sarcastic, sometimes full-of-genuine-excitement acclamation. (And on the other side of the coin, FTL means for the loss.)\n\nFWIW: For what it’s worth\n\nThis social media acronym is commonly used to express one’s opinion, but in a way that isn’t rude or overbearing. It shows you’re not intentionally trying to call someone out if they share something you don’t think is correct. You’ll most often find this on Twitter or message boards.\n\nFYI: For your information\n\nThis social media acronym is an informative abbreviation, sometimes delivered with a hint of sass.\n\nH/T: Hat tip\n\nSometimes just HT, a hat tip is a virtual nod that credits an original source for intel or an image. It can also stand for heard through.\n\nICYMI: In case you missed it\n\nA way to highlight content or news that might have been missed in the everlasting blitz that is social media.\n\nIMO/IMHO: In my opinion / In my humble opinion\n\nA disclaimer that someone is sharing their opinion, not facts, about something. Opinions are divided on whether the H stands for humble or honest.\n\nIRL: In real life\n\nIRL is used to distinguish when something happens in reality, not on social media, in games or anywhere else on the internet.\n\nJSYK: Just so you know\n\nThis acronym is used when delivering useful info.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PiperMad_duck/status/1535517904069963776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nLMK: Let me know\n\nWhen someone uses this social media abbreviation, they’re waiting for feedback or information.

Think twice before using it — and sharing any NSFW content — on a corporate account.\n\nNYT: Name your trade\n\nUsed in groups and forums where exchanges are made. Has misled many to assume The New York Times is in very high demand.\n\nOC: Original content\n\nAnother way of showing that you are sharing your own content, not someone else’s ideas or words. Basically the opposite of RT. For example, sharing a photo over Twitter that you took would be OC. Sharing someone else’s photo wouldn’t.\n\nWFH: Working from home\n\nUnsurprisingly, this acronym gained a lot of traction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Often used in online chats with colleagues, but this can be useful for social media as well.\n\nSMH: Shaking my head\n\nFor the times when it’s necessary people know that you’re unimpressed or incredulous, and possibly literally shaking your head behind that screen.\n\nTBH: To be honest\n\nMuch like IMO, this social media abbreviation is used to show vulnerability, as a humble flex, to share an opinion or show you agree or disagree with something.\n\nTBT: Throwback Thursday\n\nLike FBF, this is another social media-designated day of nostalgia.\n\nTFTF: Thanks for the follow\n\nTwitter slang. This social media abbreviation is a way to interact in a positive way with someone who recently started following you on social.\n\nTFW: That feeling when\n\nPrecedes an often relatable experience, and is usually accompanied by a meme.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nTGIF: Thank God it’s Friday\n\nBecause everybody’s working for the weekend.\n\nTL;DR: Too long; Didn’t read\n\nUsually used to offer a pithy summary on something too lengthy for Internet attention spans. Or it’s the summary typed out before or after the long explanation, kind of like the Coles Notes version of a social media caption.\n\nWBW: Wayback Wednesday\n\nWayback Wednesday takes a trip down memory lane on hump day.\n\nWCW: Woman crush Wednesday\n\nA day of the week to celebrate a self-identifying woman, usually on Instagram, for whatever reason! There’s also MCM: Man Crush Monday.
