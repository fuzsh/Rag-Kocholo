Actively listening to their response gives me a chance to help find relevant solutions that enables them to reach their goals.\n\nDuring a recent conversation with writer Michael Simmons, I mentioned that my teams actually look forward to getting feedback.\n\nI attribute that to the culture I’ve grown, where failing isn’t frowned upon. This “willing to fail” (WTF) policy gives employees permission to take risks that differentiate our company in a competitive marketplace.\n\nA “WTF” culture also ensures that feedback is provided with a constructive spirit that ensures employees feel validated in their role.\n\nConnect with Brian Scudamore on Twitter @brianscudamore"
