        "text": "The slang abbreviation ATM indicates that the person sending the text or message is busy. This slang expression is similar to the slang initialisms AFK (away from keyboard) and RN (right now).\n\nExamples of how your teen might use the slang term ATM:\n\n-Want to play Valheim?\n\n-Walking the dog atm.\n\n-I’ll text you later. We’re at the checkout atm.\n\n-Can I come over?\n\n-Sorry ATM I’m babysitting.\n\n-We’re having a Stranger Things watch party. Want to join?\n\n-I’m at work atm.\n\nYou might learn your child is using this slang term by chance when a text pops up on the phone screen. But while the slang term ATM is harmless, other teenage slang terms could indicate that your teen is talking about risky behaviors or communicating with potentially dangerous people.\n\nHaving a parental control app on your child’s phone will give you peace of mind by alerting you to your child’s exposure to risks encountered on their phone. With a parental control app installed on your child’s phone, you have the control to set alerts to help your teen avoid the pitfalls of predators, drug dealers, and other negative influences. Having the ability to vary the level of monitoring gives you the power to choose what is right for your child, and these levels can be adjusted easily at any time."
