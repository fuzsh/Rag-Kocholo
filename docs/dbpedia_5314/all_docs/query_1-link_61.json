        "text": "Bought a pair of Castelli lightness gloves last Fall and the seams burst inside 3 or 4 rides. Not great but no biggy, the wife sewed them up for me a treat. Figured I had been unlucky and gotten a bad pair.\n\nCouple weeks ago I treated myself to a pair of Castelli Espresso gloves. 3 rides later and the stitching has indeed burst and the gel pads are falling out. If I’m being honest I was\n\nalready pretty underwhelmed when they first arrived at my door.\n\nSo the latest ones are in the process of being returned and I start looking for better replacements, I figure I’d be silly at this point to buy castelli again so I’m looking at Assos and Gripgrab but one glance at buyers reviews on Wiggle is all it takes to see people are having the same issues with these gloves too - they are falling apart after 1 or 2 rides!\n\nI have two other pairs of gloves which were absolute bargain basement territory - a pair of no names I bought from Ali express for £6 that I use on the trainer and a pair of Cevapro padded gloves I bought from Amazon for £14 a year ago. Both these cheapo gloves have done thousands of miles and not a single frayed stitch anywhere so why the hell are premium brand name gloves falling to bits?"
