        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIndia's Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has discussed new venues for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final with the International Cricket Council (ICC). The final will be held in June 2025, following a series of losses in England. India currently holds the top spot in WTC rankings with 74 points and 68.52 per cent, while Australia holds second with 90 points in 12 matches and a point percentage of 62.50.\n\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah indicated that the BCCI has spoken with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to decide the new venues for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final.\n\nShah acknowledged that it would be difficult to locate a different time slot or another location that could hold the World Test Championship (WTC) final in June, but he also mentioned that the BCCI had discussed potential new locations with the ICC.\n\nIndia lost the first two finals, which were held in England. While the third WTC Final will be played in June 2025 the last two WTC Finals were held in England.\n\n\"We have spoken to the ICC about it. They will consider changing the venue,\" Shah said during a media interaction at the BCCI headquarters as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.\n\nIndia claimed the top spot in WTC rankings with 74 points and 68.52 per cent. While Australia continue to breathe down India's neck as they tightly hold onto the second spot with 90 points in 12 matches and a point percentage of 62.50.\n\nThe Asian side will look to bolster their position in the WTC standings as they still have two home series in the ongoing cycle.\n\nSo far, India has advanced to the WTC Finals two times. In 2021, New Zealand defeated India by 8 wickets while in 2023, the strong Australia handed India their second finals setback at the Oval.\n\nRohit Sharma's India leads the latest World Test Championship (WTC) standings. This followed an easy 4-1 home win against England earlier in January. On the other hand, Australia is ranked second in the standings.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWatch out for these 3 things if you’re holding Unicommerce stocks\n\nA list of 15 stocks that FPIs are buying amid an expensive market\n\nAs markets are not immune from cycles, what should investors do?\n\nThese cars aren’t really Toyota’s own, but account for 50% of its India sales\n\nIs India’s influence in the subcontinent waning?\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage?
