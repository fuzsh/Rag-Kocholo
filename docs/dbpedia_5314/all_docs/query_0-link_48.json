        "text": "India and Australia are clashing with one another in the World Test Championship Final at The Oval in England, London, from Wednesday onwards until June 11, Sunday.\n\nOver the last two years, various countries have battled it out with one another in multiple Test series, now two remain to decide who will win this year's WTC Final.\n\nAustralia qualified for this match by leading the WTC table with 152 points, while India qualified for their second consecutive WTC Final by finishing just below the Aussies on the table with 127 points.\n\nWhile both players and supporters will be focused on the pitch and on every ball their side faces, in the back of their mind the coveted Championship will also be in their thoughts.\n\nMORE: Bet on the World Test Championship in India here\n\nHere's what the WTC Final prize is and how it looks!\n\nWhat is the WTC Final trophy?\n\nThe WTC Final trophy in fact isn't a trophy at all, with the prize shifting away from the conventional designs used for International Cricket Council (ICC) Championships go for.\n\nIt is instead a mace similar to those prizes handed out to winners of Test series over the years.\n\nHow does the WTC Final trophy look?\n\nDesigned by English luxury brand Thomas Lyte, the mace pays tribute to Test cricket played over the years. The central point of the mace is the cricket ball, with the idea being that at it's core cricket is about the ball through which action takes place irrespective of by which side of the pitch. Around the ball is a globe to show how Test cricket is spread all around our world and leaves no space untouched.\n\nThe original mace was designed all the way back in 2000 by famed trophy designer Trevor Brown, who was inspired when he saw a bowler collect a wicket stump as a price for himself. That visual gave him the idea of making a mace as the prize for Test cricket and differ from usual trophies.\n\n\"One of the moments that inspired the design...was seeing a cricketer grab a stump as a souvenir after a particularly close match. As the stump was waved aloft it occurred to me that a maceâ€¦could stand out against a typical cup design and be something quite different,\" said Brown."
