        "text": "The Global Tourism Economy Forum (“GTEF” or “the Forum”)will convene in Macao under the theme “Tourism and Leisure: Roadmap to a Beautiful Life” on 13 - 15 October. Centred on the concept of “Beautiful Life” raised by President Xi Jinping, the Forum will lead forward-thinking discussions on global tourism economy. This year, GTEF will deepen its collaboration with the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) by bringing the finale of the “UNWTO Tourism Tech Adventure: SportsTech” to Macao for the first time. The first “GTEF ∙ World Tourism Investment and Financing Conference” will also be launched in this edition.\n\nThe organizer, the Secretariat for Social Affairs and Culture, held a pre-event press conference today (24 September). Chief of Office of the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, Ip Peng Kin, Director of Macao Government Tourism Office (MGTO) and Vice Chairman of GTEF, Maria Helena de Senna Fernandes, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of GTEF, Pansy Ho, unveiled the event program of GTEF 2019.\n\nIn his remarks, Ip Peng Kin underlined that Macao stands as a major hub along the Belt and Road and one of the core cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, strengthened by the Central Government’s strong support to become “One Centre, One Platform and One Base”. With the myriad of significant opportunities, Macao’s tourism industry is reaching a new development milestone. “The Forum is a locally-established international tourism brand that has been delivering Macao’s unique constitutional, cultural and geographical advantages. It demonstrates our city’s resolve to steer the global tourism economy towards sustainability,” he pointed out.\n\nExpressing her gratitude to different circles of the society for their ardent support to GTEF, Pansy Ho emphasized that it is vital for Macao’s tourism and economy to progress forward as an integral part of national development, deepen strategic cooperation and stimulate innovation in the industry. She stated, “GTEF has established itself asa fixture of Macao. Through our platform, we strive to strengthen the connections betweenthe globaltourism industry andits related industries to embrace China’s ‘holistic tourism’ and tourism plus strategies and to promote the sustainable development of the tourism economy.”\n\nThe Forum is dedicated to radiating an increasingly far-reaching impact as an advanced platform for international tourism exchange and cooperation. Capitalizing on Macao’s role as a bridge that connects different peoples and enhances cooperation between China and the world, as well as a strategic tourism hub in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Forum is committed to enhancing the sustainable development of the global tourism industry with a special focus on China, and guiding global tourism stakeholders to unlock new opportunities across China and the Greater Bay Area. At this high time that marks the dual celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Republic of China and the 20th anniversary of the Establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region, as well as the launch of the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, delegates will join hands to explore and shape a new landscape for the tourism ecosystem.\n\nFeaturing Argentina and Brazil as the Partner Countries and Jiangsu as the Featured Chinese Province, the 8th edition of GTEFwill bring together ministers of sports, culture and tourism, corporate leaders and experts from worldwide to discuss the latest tourism policies and trends, unveil vast opportunities for new growth in cultural, sports and wellness tourism, as well as explore in depth the interplay potential between the tourism markets of China and Latin America.\n\nDeepen collaboration with UNWTO\n\nThe Forum will incorporate new elements to expand new possibilities for tourism innovation and investment. This year, the Forum will deepen its collaboration with UNWTO to stage the finale of the “UNWTO Tourism Tech Adventure: SportsTech” for the first time, set to foster reform and innovation in the tourism value chain.\n\nIn collaboration with UNWTO, the signature “Face to Face, Ministers and Private Sector CEOs” session will return with a high-level dialogue between ministers and global private-sector CEOs around the topic of cultural, sports and wellness tourism. In addition, UNWTO and the Global Tourism Economy Research Centre (GTERC) will co-launch the sixth edition of the UNWTO/GTERC Asia Tourism Trends. The report will present not only the tourism trends and outlook for the Asia-Pacific region, but also a feature analysis on the vast development potential of Argentina and Brazil as tourism markets, as well as a window into the potential of the cultural, sports and wellness tourism markets in Asia-Pacific in moving towards sustainability.\n\nLaunch of first World Tourism Investment and Financing Conference\n\nAnother new highlight in the Forum is the “GTEF ∙ World Tourism Investment and Financing Conference”. Three round-table discussion panels will unfold to explore the topics of “Tourism Investment and Cooperation in the Global Multilateral System”, “Potential of Chinese Tourism Investment & Cooperation Opportunities in ‘Belt and Road’ Projects” and “Valuation of Tourism Project: Investment & Financing Strategy”, Some of the world's top investment experts and tourism leaders will share their latest investment insights and inspire delegates to explore new opportunities in the tourism markets along the Belt and Road and across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nThe program of GTEF 2019 will also feature collaborative panels with the Forum’s supporting units once again, including “The Role of Chinese Private Enterprises in the Building of the Greater Bay Area: Pioneering Diversified Tourism Offerings for a Beautiful Life” in cooperation with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), “Smart Cities to Smart Tourism Destinations: Towards Wellness and Happiness” in cooperation with the World Tourism Cities Federation (WTCF) and “Travel Lab Asia: Challenges and Opportunities of Bringing Tourism Sustainable Technology to Asia Pacific” in cooperation with the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), among other sessions.
