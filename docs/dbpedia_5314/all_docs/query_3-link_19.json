        "text": "I'm curious about the reason for calling these acronyms \"elitist,\" but a general answer to your question is\n\nyes, these acronyms are being assimilated into more general use, but\n\nno, these acronyms are not becoming words with significantly different meaning.\n\nRegarding the reference to SNAFU, FUBAR and OK, the argument to be made is whether the original meaning, not the origins, is lost. \"OK\" is deceiving in that, while almost no one could state what the earliest-recorded expansion of the acronym is, we still use it in the same general meaning. The expansions of the other two can be sussed out with a bit of work, as they come from actual words rather than colloquial satire. These, too, are still used with the same general meaning, though we choose to ignore the masked vulgarity. Further, the expansion of shorter acronyms, such as FYI and BTW, will quite possibly remain in the common understanding until the words actually fall out of use.\n\nSnafu and Fubar have assimilated further than will \"FYI\", \"BTW\" and their ilk. \"FOO-bar\" and \"SNA-foo\" can be pronounced as words. Will people actually start saying \"FWEE\" or \"BE-twa,\" outside the ironic \"B-T-DUB\" that Tonza offers? I'm uncertain, but I have a feeling the answer is \"no.\"\n\n\"OK,\" IIRC, may be in the extreme minority as it has actually been turned into the word \"Okay.\" \"LOL\" is sometimes made \"LOLing\" or \"loling\" as it can actually be pronounced coherently as a word-construction, but I don't see the same fate for these other acronyms.\n\nRegarding stacker's opinion, I don't believe this to be a difference between acronyms and abbreviations. Acronyms are built using the initial letter of all or most of the non-articles in a phrase. An abbr. is a shortened version of a word, where a number of characters are lopped off from the end (and sometimes inside) the word.\n\nAnd, FYI, SCSI (Small Computer System Interface, pronounced \"scuzzy\") is an acronym.\n\nJust my personal opinion:\n\nThe difference between acronyms and abbreviation is that acronyms can be pronounced like a word and abbreviations are typically pronounced letter by letter.\n\nSometimes abbreviations have been extended in spoken English, like SCSI became \"scasi\".\n\nLaser (origin: acronym for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\") is a good example of an acronym which has been accepted as a word. I doubt that \"FYI\" or \"BTW\" can be accepted as a word.\n\nWhether the usage of these these abbreviations is appropriate depends on your readship.\n\nIn a user manual which is considered as a formal document you shouldn't use them at all (of course technical abbreviations would be OK).\n\nIn a non-technical blog you could probably use \"BTW\" and \"LOL\". But what's the point to use vulgar slang like \"WTF\"? This is rather a matter of how want to be perceived by your readers."
