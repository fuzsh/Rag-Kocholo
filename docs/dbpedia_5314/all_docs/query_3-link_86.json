        "text": "The WTF value is a game mechanic featured in OMORI. It is a number that is randomly generated upon entering VAST FOREST for the first time, and immediately after departing NEIGHBOR'S ROOM during the PROLOGUE.\n\nIt will notably cause a series of events to randomly occur depending on its value from the numbers 1 to 13.\n\nOVERVIEW[]\n\nAt the very beginning of the game when you first leave NEIGHBOR'S ROOM and before KEL pulls AUBREY out of the stump, a number from 1-13 is rolled. This roll determines the value of your 'WTF' variable. There are a few things that change depending on it; basically, the higher your 'WTF' value, the more random occurrences will happen.\n\nEVENTS[]\n\nThe amount of CLAMS given by TIFFANY DARLING when speaking to her in the LAST RESORT depends on the player's WTF value. These range from:\n\nIf WTF is set from 1 to 3 = 2,000 CLAMS\n\nIf WTF is set from 4 to 6 = 1,000 CLAMS\n\nIf WTF is set from 7 to 9 = 500 CLAMS\n\nIf WTF is set from 10 to 13 = 100 CLAMS.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 2, a photo of someone familiar will appear in the JUNKYARD TUNNELS 2 map. Interacting with it as any character will display the same text as the photo in NEIGHBOR'S ROOM. However, if OMORI is tagged as the leader, interacting will additionally result in the photo transforming into SOMETHING, making a creepy noise, and then disappearing.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 3, a HANGED BODY from FISH OUT OF WATER appears in the top right of the end of the LOST FOREST map. Going near it prompts it to play the sound SE_bs_creature2 before it disappears.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 4, a cockroach named SIMPLE ROACH appears in the top right of THE ROYAL KITCHEN. Interacting with it plays a line of dialogue before it fades away.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 5, a SEACOW named ROAMIN' COW will appear on the ENDLESS HIGHWAY, walking towards to the end of the map before vanishing. Interacting with it gives dialogue.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 6, an NPC named BLUEGIRL will appear in PINK BEACH in BLACK SPACE. Interacting with her gives dialogue.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 6, the STRANGER BASIL briefly appears when exiting the interior of an ABANDONED HOUSE in NORTH LAKE for the first time, during the screen transition.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 6, SOMETHING will appear in the bottom left corner of the telescope view of the NORTH LAKE within the LIGHTHOUSE located northeast of the MAIN CURRENTS map.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 6 and if the player has opened the door for MARI on the first night, HELLMARI can be found hovering on the bed in MOM'S ROOM for a total of 666 frames before vanishing. This event can be viewed by checking the room immediately after the jumpscare.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 7, RUNNING MELON appears in the to the right of the igloo in the map that leads to SNOWGLOBE MOUNTAIN. This melon runs away from the player, giving a TOFU if smashed.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 8, the SPELLING BEE appears in the EXPERIMENT 667 room inside HUMPHREY. It uses the same dialogue from the PROLOGUE and disappears after the chase sequence.\n\nIf WTF ≥ 8, in the CURRENT MAP (go to the left immediately on the dock with MARI and swim to the left) on the 2nd island to the right, a STRANGER NPC (BASIL'S GRANDMA) will appear with a line of dialogue. She will constantly turn around to face OMORI and MARI just like her grandson on THREE DAYS LEFT (SUNNY ROUTE).\n\nIf WTF ≥ 9, DADDY LONGLEGS appears in PYREFLY FOREST in the same map with the RARE BEAR. DADDY LONGLEGS will slowly vanish when the event is loaded in-game, without speaking any single line of dialogue.\n\nNote that this only happens if the player has not yet visited OTHERWORLD. Due to PYREFLY FOREST being accessible only after the player completes OTHERWORLD, the event itself is technically \"unused\".\n\nIf WTF ≥ 9, a SQUIZZARD appears in the bottom right of the SEACOW FARM map. It spins around and does nothing.\n\nIf WTF = 13, one of the HUMPHREY bumps in MEDUSA's sector says \"I fucking love air-conditioning\" if interacted with, then sets a self switch to say the normal dialogue.\n\nIf WTF = 13, on the OMORI ROUTE, sleeping until tomorrow results in the MOVERS becoming shadow sprites, much like the HEADSPACE STRANGER characters.\n\nGALLERY[]\n\nTRIVIA[]\n\nIn the game's data, the number assigned to the WTF value's variable is listed as \"143\", which appears to have been a deliberate choice as there are plenty of unused variables before this number. The number 143 also appears in a few other notable scenarios throughout the game.\n\nThere is also notably a specific detail behind the number '143', and SOMETHING is also noted to say \"I love you\" in one of the BLACK SPACE areas.\n\nSome of the events the WTF value generates correlates with the background behind the game's plot.\n\nThe hallucination of MARI's body that can be found near the sliding glass door in SUNNY'S HOUSE and at the bottom of the stairs during the SPIDERS hallucination was originally planned to only appear if the WTF value is greater than or equal to 6.\n\nThe overall premise of this mechanic works similar to that of Undertale's Fun Value.\n\nDespite being shown only if the WTF value is greater than or equal to 13, HUMPHREY's hidden dialogue of him swearing is the only time where the game text uses explicit profanity. This instance was also mentioned on the game's official ESRB ratings page.\n\nSITE NAVIGATION[]"
