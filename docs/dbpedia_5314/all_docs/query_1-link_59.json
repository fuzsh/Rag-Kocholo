Specifically, I have Flask-WTF version 1.0.0 installed in my Python environment, but PyCharm is showing a red line under from flask_wtf import FlaskForm.\n\nHere's a snippet of my requirements.txt file:\n\nblinker==1.7.0 Bootstrap-Flask==2.2.0 certifi==2024.2.2 charset-normalizer==3.3.2 click==8.1.7 colorama==0.4.6 Flask==2.3.2 Flask-WTF==1.0.0 idna==3.6 itsdangerous==2.2.0 Jinja2==3.1.3 MarkupSafe==2.1.5 packaging==24.0 pillow==10.2.0 python-dotenv==1.0.1 requests==2.31.0 urllib3==2.2.1 webdriver-manager==4.0.1 Werkzeug==3.0.0 WTForms==3.0.1\n\nI've already verified that Flask-WTF is installed correctly using pip list, and the package is indeed listed there. I've also tried the following troubleshooting steps:\n\nCleared PyCharm's cache using File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart.\n\nRe-imported the project into PyCharm.\n\nEnsured that PyCharm is using the correct Python interpreter and that it matches the one where Flask-WTF is installed.\n\nUpdated PyCharm to the latest version and checked for updates.\n\nDespite these efforts, the issue persists. I'm not sure what else to try, and any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!\n\nBest regards, Ruth Blossom"
