When I haven't heard back, I sent messages through Indeed expressing my interest and NOTHING.  I cannot take this job hunt anymore. Why do employers post jobs if they don't seem like they're intending to hire?\n\nWhat is going on with this job market? I heard September-October was the best time to apply.\n\nEdit: Just so no one thinks that I'm entitled, I have been looking for another job for 3 years. I should feel allowed to be frustrated. Yes, I have been getting interviews.",
