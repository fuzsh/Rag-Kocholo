        "text": "High-wire artist Philippe Petit this week is celebrating the 50th anniversary of his historic walk between the two World Trade Center towers with special performances at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, also in New York.\n\nOffered on August 7 and 8, the program, called TOWERING!!, will feature Petit on the high wire, artistically recreating his original World Trade Center walk on August 7 1974. The singer, Sting, a friend of Petit’s since the early 1970’s (Petit calls them “brothers”), will perform a world-premiere song written about Petit, plus two of his hits. Also performing will be Grammy-nominated jazz clarinetist Anat Cohen and Barbie whistler Molly Lewis.\n\nConceived and directed by Petit, the show, Petit said, “will unfold in a series of short scenes, many evoking what took place in 1974. The production takes full advantage of the visual and acoustic grandeur of the setting, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world.”\n\nIn an interview with Forbes.com last week, Petit called his upcoming programs “a unique celebration that will never be seen again,” and predicted they would be “the most beautiful, powerful and inspiring” performances of his “entire life.”\n\nHe will perform on a wire 20 feet high across the cathedral’s nave, allowing audience members to see his face, feet and choreography close up, as opposed to his being “a dot in the sky” 50 years ago.\n\nPetit, who lives near Woodstock, N.Y. and will turn 75 next week, suggested “most people see age as diminishing life, diminishing facilities. In my case, I believe dozens of years of practicing my art has made me a better actor. I’m not as strong and supple (as in the past), I have to edit myself if I want to continue performing.” However, he believes he is a stronger, “more majestic wire-walker” in his old age, which he said “forces my body to follow my mind.”\n\nPetit has been an artist in residence at the cathedral, which is located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, for over 40 years, previously performing 23 times to benefit it.\n\nThis week’s shows will support the cathedral’s programs and preservation of Petit’s archives, located in his home and in his office at the cathedral. The archives safeguard information about his hundreds of high-wire performances all over the world, plus his collections about the history of wire-walking, knot-tying, magic and languages (he is fluent in six, including his native French, English, Spanish, Italian, German and Russian).\n\nBoth shows will start at 8.30 and last approximately 75 minutes, with a champagne reception for patrons after each."
