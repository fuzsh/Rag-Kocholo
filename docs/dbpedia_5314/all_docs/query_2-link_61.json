        "text": "Hospitality businesses can send the relevant information to be part of a platform created on the 2023.pontevedra.gal website in order to set up a database which will be available to visitors who will come to Pontevedra during the competition.\n\nThe councilor for Sports and Economic Promotion, Anabel Gulías, appeared at a press conference to announce the creation of a specific area on the website in order to promote and make the local hospitality industry visible during the Grand Final of the Triathlon World Series.\n\nDuring the last meetings held between the two parties, the City Council and managers of the hospitality companies agreed on the need to create a platform that could make the gastronomic proposals of the Boa Vila visible during the days that the competition lasts.\n\n“We are launching a registration form so that all the establishments that are interested can register”, said the mayor. “It’s a simple form that collects information about the premises such as the name, logo, location in the city, menu, type of cuisine, opening hours, the languages in which they can serve customers, the possibility of offering vegan menus , gluten-free, etc., as well as the online menu”.\n\nOnce the City Council has the business’ information, it will be uploaded to the official website of the World Series Grand Final. Advertising brochures with the QR code on the website will be created and distributed to give access to all visitors arriving from everyone. These brochures will be available in hotels and hostels in the city and its sports facilities.\n\nRegistration will be open until 31st August. “This is a really important event for Pontevedra, an event that will generate a very significant economic return and we want the greatest part of that to remain in the city”, concluded Gulías."
