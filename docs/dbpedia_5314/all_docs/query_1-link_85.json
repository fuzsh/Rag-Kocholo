        "text": "I need to find out the typical price of two things - namely bottled water (ie: a plastic individual-size bottle of still drinking water), and, gas-station type road maps - around 1995, in the USA.\n\n(I was very much alive then, but I simply can't recall clearly.)\n\nI assumed I could just instantly search \"historic prices year by year, for item X\" but I am surprised to find that no such resource exists.\n\nThere's plenty of info on inflation as such, and price series for a few marker items (like \"butter\"), but, again, I was surprised there just does not seem to be, I could not find anyway, such data on this-or-that consumer item.\n\nThe bottled water fad had kicked in by then. (Example, Dasani, coke's bottled tap water, was released 1999; I thought I would be able to easily find the retail price of that on launch, but I couldn't even find that.)\n\nIn re road maps - the type which in the old days, you bought in a gas station en route - bizarrely I have a large collection of old ones myself, including many USA ones, but couldn't find one with a price; nor could I find an online pic of one, from the year, showing the price.\n\nWith bottled water it's further tricky in that, just as today, the supermarket price versus convenience store price versus gas station price is wildly different.\n\nFTR I'm interested in the price of \"cheap\" bottled water, not Perrier or such.\n\n(I really couldn't even find the price of a - say - \"cheap can of Coke\" in 1995, which would likely be similarly priced to a bottled water; and again I literally just can't recall how much a \"cheap can of Coke\" was in the 90s!)\n\nSomeone may know the info source I can't find, or indeed, someone with a plain good memory may have the facts!\n\nAgain, I was shocked you can't just instantly look up a list \"price of X, every year 1970 to present\" sort of thing - surprising.\n\n(*) Nowadays paper road maps, I see, are about 10 bucks (wtf!) if bought cheaply online, probably a fair bit more at gas stations. I'd say bottle of Aquafina or such is 3-4 bucks ? at a gas station (but only 1.00 - 1.50 at a supermarket).\n\nExamples of a \"gas station -type map\", aka a folding, single-sheet paper map in the very typical size. (I don't know a better nomenclature than \"gas station -type map\".\n\nMap prices will vary quite a bit based on the size, complexity, and quality of the map you're looking for. For example, a search on archive.org for \"1995 map cleveland\" turned up scans of this detailed map of Cleveland with \"$12.95\" on the cover. That was fairly standard price for a 100+ page, laminated, book-bound map with that level of detail. Your standard impossible-to-re-fold flimsy paper map is a bit harder to find since their size makes them difficult to scan. I found this city map of Newark from 2009 that was labeled \"$4.99\". That's about $3.50 in 1995 dollars, which seems about right to my memory for a map that size. Printing costs dominate the cost for these cheaper maps, so it's all a factor of overall size, paper quality, and number of ink colors.\n\nMost people didn't actually pay for maps, though (at least in my experience). Racks full of brochures and free maps were common sights in gas stations, hotel lobbies, and large rest stops. Chambers of commerce and other civic groups would publish city maps with local landmarks and tourist attractions marked on them. The state department of transportation would distribute free maps of the state's highway system, like this 1990 map of Montana. Gas stations would sometimes publish their own maps that had store locations marked on them. You could even send off for free travel guides from a state's transportation or tourism department. These were large atlases with high-level as well as detailed regional maps (example for Texas from 1996). There was a decent chance that a gas station on a highway would even have fairly nice maps posted on the wall inside the store for travelers to reference.\n\nAs far as bottled water goes, the price depends on how you buy it. Standard vending machine prices where I lived (per my memory, it's hard to find a source) were 50 cents for a 12oz can and 75 cents for a 20oz bottle. Buying from the cooler in a gas station was roughly the same price, and buying a multi-pack from a grocery store was (per unit) a bit less than half of the vending machine price. Around the same price ratios as today.\n\nanswered Aug 8 at 2:05\n\nbtabta\n\n18122 bronze badges"
