        "text": "PORTAGE, MI — A new burger joint coming to Portage is turning heads with its name — but that won’t be the only way it gets peoples’ attention.\n\nWhat the Flavor Burger, or “WTF Burger” for short, is expected to open this fall at 2046 W. Centre Ave. in West Centre Plaza.\n\nDon’t expect the restaurant to open quietly. Business owner Artist SinGh, of Kalamazoo, expects to enter the Guinness Book of World Records (again) by creating the world’s largest burger at the restaurant’s grand opening.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records, the current record was achieved in Germany in 2017 when six people created a burger weighing in at 2,566 pounds and nine ounces.\n\nSinGh plans to surpass that with the first official WTF burger.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun restaurant,” he said. “The response we’ve had just from ... our signs has been really humongous.”\n\nAs humongous as the record-setting burger he plans to make? Only time will tell.\n\nWhile his grand opening stunt may seem ambitious, SinGh is no stranger to ambitious feats — or the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nHe previously held the Guinness record for the world’s longest painting, for a 2.15-mile-long piece dubbed “The Transcendental” that took 38 days to complete and was entered into — and got him kicked out of — the 2013 Grand Rapids Art Prize.\n\nRelated: Guinness World Record awarded to 2-mile long painting booted out of ArtPrize 2013\n\nHe’s also been recognized for creating the world’s largest oil painting, largest easel and longest drawing. Then there is his feat of hanging upside down from a crane 70 feet off the ground and creating a painting while suspended in the air.\n\nWhen it comes to his new restaurant, the India native hopes to win fans over with a different type of art. Cooking.\n\n“The whole idea is to bring in flavor,” he said. “In America, we are more about salt and pepper. And that’s not how it is in India. My background is all Indian cuisine, which (uses) a lot of spices.\n\n“So, I figured we could do something different, and at the same time, give people what they want.”\n\nWhile he isn’t ready to share what the menu will look like entirely, there will be a signature burger called “The Ultimate WTF,” mixing true Indian flavor into an American classic.\n\nIn addition, WTF will serve build-your-own burgers and several kinds of fries, with at least one including multiple Indian spices.\n\nRaised mostly in Dubai, SinGh came to the U.S. after high school to go to college. After earning a bachelor’s in business at Emporia State University in Kansas, he moved to Kalamazoo to be closer to his brother. He later earned a master’s degree from Spring Arbor University and also took master’s courses in business at Western Michigan University.\n\nFor the past decade-plus, he has operated his own gallery on South Burdick Street, which he’ll continue.\n\nAfter opening his first WTF Burger in Portage this fall, SinGh plans to open two more in Grand Rapids, he said.\n\nThe Portage store, being built at a former Sheldon Cleaners on the corner of Oakland Drive and West Centre Avenue, was selected based on location.\n\nWith upward of 85,000 people living and working within a 5-mile radius, SinGh expects to stay busy with carryout and delivery orders. There will also be substantial seating for those who wish to eat inside.\n\nWTF Burger does not plan to serve alcohol, just pop. It will also offer “quality food at an affordable price,” he said.\n\nSocial media pages and the website are in the process of being built.\n\nAlso on MLive:\n\nArtPrize bans its first artist for good: Artist SinGh denied entry for past rule violations\n\nBanned ArtPrize artist creates his own ‘$1M’ counter-prize\n\nKalamazoo stunt artist Gurmej Singh believes he is redefining art"
