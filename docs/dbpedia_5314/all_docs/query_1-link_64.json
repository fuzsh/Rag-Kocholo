        "text": "I'm not a Jitter guy, so forgive possible wrongheadedness, but I don't see a \"varname\" attribute for these objects. I see a \"name\" attribute, though.\n\nThe actual name for this attribute (if you click the ampersand at the left of the toolbar in the bottom of an object's Inspector window to reveal the internal attribute names) is 'varname'. This is also the field of the Inspector that Max jumps to when you select an object and hit Cmd-apostrophe (') for the Object->Nameâ€¦ menu.\n\nThe Jitter matrix name is another animal. That, indeed, is simply called 'name'. Not the guy I'm lookin' for, though.\n\nSorry Peter, this is somewhat arcane, but varname and other \"box\" attributes aren't possible to set via object box text, or by direct message. In part this is to avoid potential naming conflicts and ambiguities that might arise from a box attribute and the underlying object's attribute.\n\nSo the simple answer is that this isn't possible due to the separation of a box and its contained object, and it won't be changed soon.\n\nAhh. Well, using the \"drag name out of inspector\" trick, it looks like the varname has to be sent using \"sendbox,\" which I don't know if it's possible to do with attributes.\n\nWas wondering about that, it seems like as the number of attributes grows, it makes one wonder why all attributes aren't settable in the same way that some are, using the @notation. That's fine, but it has been a bit confusing at times...which can be, and which not?\n\nGreat that the Jitter objects seem to be all (mostly?) on the same page, whereby one can set any listed attribute (from the popup, not the Inspector) using @.\n\nMaybe that's the confusion, the Inspector leads one to believe that one can set any of those, but in reality only a few are available using @.\n\nIn a new created patcher (with at least one inlet), it's not possible to set the scritpting name also using the external command (sendbox varname $1)... no way...\n\nIt seems more a bug!"
