        "text": "Introduction\n\nMobile devices connected to the internet such as smartphones and tablets have become the choice platform for the millennial generation engaged in various internet activities. There has been spectacular growth in the global mobile market with projection of increases in ownership and penetration rates (GSMA Intelligence Report, 2016). The estimate is to be at 5.8 billion subscribers and 71 per cent penetration rate by the year 2025.\n\nAdvances in technologies and ICTs have led to greater use of mobile technology in the education sector, and particularly at the university level. Many institutions worldwide have started to experiment with various learning methods and integrating mobile phone use to facilitate students’ learning. The higher education sector has become increasingly technology-driven. More developed countries are using modern advances in educational technologies and instructional design. These range from e-learning, distance education, Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD), use of online and social media, student response systems in classrooms, to now game-based learning, Web 2.0, simulation technology, three-dimensional apps and virtual classroom environments. These advances in conjunction with newer pedagogies such as adaptive, collaborative and hybrid learning styles are being used to enhance students’ learning experiences. This has created disruption in pedagogical structure and framework of learning institutions resulting in noticeable shifts from instructor led to more student-learner centered, self-lifelong modes of learning. Universities in Jamaica and the Anglophone Caribbean have also embarked on initiatives to increase the use of technologies in their institutions in response to the emergence of these educational technologies.\n\nFor instance, University of the West Indies, the region’s premier higher education institution in the English speaking Caribbean, with campuses located in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, through their Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning have accelerated ongoing drive to sensitize and train lecturers in how to use mobile and other ICT technologies in the class setting. Recent developments such as the “Inaugural Teaching with Technology Showcase” (2014), e-book access for incoming graduate students allow for real time, interactive online and group study, and support services provided by MITS, the university’s information technology services leverage technology use to drive students’ IT requirements during their course of study, via the UWI Triple A Strategy (2017-2022).\n\nMobile and ICTs, therefore, provide many opportunities to create, deliver and support innovative methods of learning. Research points to the use of such technologies in facilitating collaboration and communication, enhancing creative and interactive learning styles and the development of tools, applications to aid in the delivery of educational content. Institutions, therefore, have to carefully weigh investments made in technology against the benefits realized by students and administration in adopting such technologies in learning environment. Technology implementation can create its own set of challenges and issues specific to each institution. This can represent substantial costs and resources expended to acquire potential benefits.\n\nHence, a study of students’ perception, views and opinions about the use of cell phones as a learning tool in class setting is an important consideration for university administration decision-makers for mobile technology adoption. Students’ user acceptance of mobile devices in the learning environment is even more critical for Caribbean and developing world institutions in the context of significant infrastructural, institutional, socio-economic and financial resource constraints.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to examine students’ perception about the use of mobile phones in an educational setting in a higher education institution located in Jamaica. Research indicates that the study of various user acceptance models in developed countries is a useful technique in predicting successful adoption of technology in learning. Given our unique challenges and constraints, such studies on student receptiveness to mobile technology use in classroom scenario may better inform institutions how to integrate mobile phone usage into pedagogies and delivery modes to enhance student performance and learning outcomes.\n\nThis research embarked on an empirical approach by collecting data on a sample of undergraduate students and soliciting their perception about using cell phones in a class setting via survey instrument. To elaborate and investigate our main objective, we explored in further depth two areas:\n\nHow do students perceive/rate their own use of mobile phone technology use and impact on their learning and academic performance?\n\nHow do students perceive/rate their lecturers’ use of mobile phone technology use and impact on their learning and academic performance?\n\nIt is hoped that the results of this survey will provide useful insights of students’ views about mobile phone use in learning and benefit lecturers, facilitators and university administrators to craft suitable strategies for better implementation in the context of Caribbean challenges, with the ultimate objective of enhancing academic performance and ensuring region’s higher education standards are on par with developed countries. The ensuing sections contain the research methodology, analysis and discussion of the results along with recommendations for the future.\n\nLiterature review\n\nTechnology’s disruptive force has forced higher education institutions to rethink current cell phone policies and to spur innovative approaches to enhance student participation and involvement in the learning process. While much of contemporary literature seem fixated with the wide range of features and capabilities of these devices, others rightly focus on identifying those key properties and attributes, which can be incorporated and employed to learning delivery methods.\n\nUniversity students are especially heavy users of cell phones and this has implications for learning outcomes at the tertiary level. Institutions will have to place greater importance on using mobile technology resources efficiently to support learning. Research cites a number of common recurring themes regarding students’ positive perception of their devices’ capabilities in their educational pursuits. They offer more appeal to students with respect to the ease of access to search for information.\n\nInternet connection enables students to use mobile phones as modern tools to collect and acquire knowledge, which creates further opportunities for learning while attending lectures. Primary benefits are enhanced communication and collaboration, along with greater interaction and increased learning irrespective of time or location.\n\nMobile devices belong to six categories such as smartwatches, mobile phones, PDAs, web pads, tablets and laptops (Sharples and Beale, 2003). Others classify mobile phones as one variant of portable digital assistants (PDAs), which is defined as any handheld device equipped with computer capabilities, which can be used to support educational objectives (Churchill and Churchill, 2008). These mobile devices facilitate students’ ability to communicate, interact, engage in discussions, store and record material for later use, give lecturers affordances to use mind mapping tools to better gauge how students think and process information. More importantly, they also facilitate higher-level thinking and computational skills.\n\nIn terms of pedagogical frameworks, there is the view that mobile phone features and attributes can be of significant value in helping to create new learning styles and methods. For instance, such devices can be used to design “collaborative, contextual and constructionist” (Patten et al., 2006) forms of learning.\n\nThe increasing use of mobile phone technology within the higher education context represents a paradigm shift in thinking about teaching and learning strategies. Existing pedagogical frameworks tend to assume that learning occurs largely in the context of a classroom setting. Many contend that mobile technology integration in learning upsets this notion and is spawning new pedagogies integrating its use inside and outside the university environment (Martin and Ertzberger, 2013; Wong and Looi, 2011; Patten et al., 2006; Attewell, 2005; Sharples, 2000).\n\nMobile phones are enabling the “here and now” of mobile learning, i.e. the ability to practice authentic learning instantly irrespective of time or location. This type of ubiquitous learning has been shown to produce significant improvements in student performance, specifically with respect to higher enjoyment levels, greater “engagement, motivation, focus and enthusiasm” (Martin and Ertzberger, 2013). Others conceive its use in assisting with “seamless” learning styles, i.e. a type of smooth, unified integration of learning experiences spanning across many dimensions of the education experience, such as students’ exposure to formal/informal, social, physical and virtual learning context. Otherwise referred to as mobile-assisted seamless learning (MSL), it can be considered to an “all-in-one” approach, which produces benefits of context-based, personalized, socially engaged and multidisciplinary approaches to learning. In addition, with continued advances in technology, such methods are considered especially relevant for applications in virtual learning environments with the growing use of digital tools.\n\nThe literature also indicates the use of mobile phone device features to support more popular learning approaches in higher education, namely, lifelong learning and mobile learning (m-learning). The pedagogy of lifelong learning focuses on providing students with higher-order skills and competencies (i.e. critical thinking, adaptability, self-directed reflection, meta-learning, creativity and problemsolving), which are required over a lifetime to succeed in a dynamic changing world (Bolhuis, 2003; Fischer, 2001).\n\nSupporting mobile technology tools ideally suited to the advancement of lifelong learning strategies as enunciated by Sharples (2000) include students’ ability to engage in collaborative and situated type learning as a response mechanism to adapting to changing environment, immediate accessibility to information, portability and personalized features to react instantaneously anytime, anywhere.\n\nDirectly emerging from mobile technology advancements, mobile learning (m-learning) is viewed as perhaps offering potentially the most exciting, futuristic and technologically advanced possibilities in revolutionizing the delivery of higher education in the immediate future. This is because mobile phones are exceptional learning tools in various educational settings (Ahmad, 2015, 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2019b). The ubiquitous nature of mobile technology combined with advances in ICT and wireless internet technology is considered to be the future of education technology and learning (Moreira et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2009).\n\nEarly development of mobile learning frameworks\n\nMobile tools have become important factors contributing to the “social, collaborative and situated elements of human learning” (Roschelle and Pea, 2002). Mobile phone, in particular, smartphones are particularly suited for collaborative and augmented learning styles (Martín-Gutiérrez et al., 2015). Such devices are regarded as vital technology support tools, which facilitate rather than replace normal methods of communication and interaction during the learning process, and hence, are essential in the creation of innovative learning strategies for university students (Naismith et al., 2004).\n\nOthers view the return on investment, cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness approaches as more important determining factors in developing strategies around appropriate pedagogical approaches to mobile phone technology integration. It provides for “flexible pedagogies” (Gordon, 2014) by supporting and enhancing personalized, and blended learning methods. In terms of cost savings and long term benefits, it can also enable real value for all education stakeholders via mechanism such as virtual learning environments, peer and assessment tools without the requirement for additional amounts of resource outlays. Mobile phone technology carries with it certain unique technical features, which present real cost savings for existing educational models. In evaluating the pedagogical impacts, both “technical and non-technical factors” (Sarrab et al., 2016) needs to be incorporated in measuring the quality impact. The entire gamut of quality performance (QUPER) factors including “flexibility, scalability, usability, maintainability, functionality, reliability, connectivity, performance, user interface, security, flexibility, scalability, usability and maintainability” (Svensson et al., 2008) will affect mobile phone adoption rates and more importantly, the receptiveness of education stakeholders to integrate it into learning. Mobile technology advances also increase students’ expectations about the delivery and access to quality education. Given the level of technology with advances in networking, internet and digitalization, students have higher expectations regarding access to lower cost and just in time modes of learning. Mobile phone technology offers this extra value from a pedagogical perspective in terms of organizing teaching and learning “on the go”, providing instant communication, collaboration, knowledge and assessment support. It is considered by some as a means of better satisfying the demands of learners while balancing the needs of institutions to provide cost-efficient quality learning outcomes in “supporting existing self-directed, interactive and constructivist pedagogical frameworks” (Rajasingham, 2011).\n\nAlternative pedagogical frameworks\n\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of mobile phones and continued advances in technology, we have witnessed a gradual shift in thinking about the creation of new approaches to teaching and learning. Much of the discussion centers on the role of mobile phones in developing personalized, collaborative and authentic forms of learning to generate rather than enhance student learning experiences and raise higher education outcomes. The literature indicates a revolutionized approach to m-learning methodologies. There is increased recognition that mobile technology’s ubiquitous nature has led to learning inside and outside the class context, which has led to new learning opportunities. Some assert that both students and lecturers need to be receptive, aware and ready to adapt to this new dispensation to successfully implement new pedagogies surrounding mobile phone technology (Moreira et al., 2018).\n\nEarlier applications of m-learning, drawn from a sample of research studies during the 2010-2015 period in US and developing world institutions, examined frameworks using cell phone integration in creating innovative learning styles, which facilitate individualized learning, anytime, anywhere, but which also allow for “unstructured” and “customizable” styles suitable to the learner’s need in any “situated and context aware” learning atmosphere (Gikas and Grant, 2013; Compton, 2013).\n\nMore recent developments have seen the creation of alternative pedagogical frameworks such as technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), technology acceptance model (TAM) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models of mobile technology integration (Scherer et al., 2019).\n\nThe TPACK framework uses supporting mobile features together with three important knowledge domains, namely, technology (supporting tools), content (educational subject matter or materials) and knowledge pedagogies (best fit education methods) to deliver the desired learning outcomes. It is referred to as the three important knowledge domains, which requires teachers to be competent in all three areas in conjunction with the supporting tools to produce the best learning outcomes.\n\nTAM attempt to explain factors, which account for acceptance and adoption of digital and mobile technologies in education. It examines such factors as perceived usefulness, ease of use and attitudes as powerful influences for comparison with other models of technology integration.\n\nOne study conducted in a South African higher education institution applied this framework with the use of the popular mobile instant messenger (MIM) app, Whatsapp, in a learning context. This application affirmed a positive relationship between these factors and perceived usefulness of mobile learning. More importantly, the use of MIM enabled efficiencies with respect to accessibility, timeliness, quality and relevance of data, which are regarded as key factors in perceived usefulness and enhancement of flexible, collaborative learning environments (Bere and Rambe, 2016).\n\nThe UTAT framework are essentially theoretical models, which try to explain the mechanism behind determining the factors contributing to technology adoption, i.e. users intentions. These factors are heavily influenced by social, psychological and behavioral factors such as performance and effort expectations, social influence and facilitating factors, which, in turn, can also be affecting age, gender and experience levels (Taherdoost, 2018; Williams et al., 2015).\n\nThe literature points to the wide differences among institutions within regions and countries with respect to these acceptance factors. These may be impacted by technology factors (e.g. security, privacy, compatibility, etc.), institutional and organizational issues (e.g. readiness, resistance to change) and quality issues in institutions located in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America (Almaiah and Al Mulhem, 2019), to developing countries in the Caribbean (English speaking Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados), which identify specific cultural, social and country-level differences “moderating UTAT effects” (Thomas et al., 2014, 2013).\n\nUse of Smart Mobile Pedagogies in response to latest technology advances\n\nRapid and dynamic evolution of technology, particularly in the mobile space will continue to generate new theoretical frameworks and experimentation about integrating mobile technology in higher education. Latest literature attempts to predict how higher education institutions will respond in the near future with the advent of higher-level: “smart technologies” such as the pending implementation of 5 G wireless mobile internet services, edge computing, the internet of things, mobile cloud computing services, and the use of mobile support tools, such as wearables for application in augmented and virtual reality learning environments (Khan et al., 2019; Sergio For tes et al., 2019).\n\nThe result is a paradigm shift in thinking and approach to learning from prior traditional, lower technology integrated, teacher led models to use of more “highly adaptive, customizable ubiquitous, mobile learning technology supported tools and devices,” which empowers and affords learners to adapt their learning experiences to suit inside and outside the classroom environment.\n\nThis would need teachers to keep current with emerging mobile and digital technologies, but also to have the needed institutional and infrastructural support to enable adequate preparation and adjustment of pedagogical approach to support learner-centered styles.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, educational researchers are beginning to see glimpses of hands-on application of these smart pedagogical approaches with the development of “smart campuses” (Fortes et al., 2019) and “smart teaching platforms” (Xu et al., 2019) based on 5 G Mobile technology and other tech advances in Chinese and Spanish education systems.\n\nExperimentation with 5 G in the Chinese university and college system has seen an explosion of mobile and online teaching network models heavily supported by government and university administration. Such testing in Chinese higher education are producing benefits in terms of students’ ability to access to materials and instructions via mobile distance teaching, real-time impact monitoring and adjustment of teaching approaches, emergency communications and real-time access and navigation of learning databases (Xu et al., 2019).\n\nCaribbean and developing world response to technology advances\n\nThe big question is how will Caribbean and developing world HE systems respond to this new wave of tech advances? How will they adjust or revamp pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning with continuous tech disruptions in a dynamic twenty-first-century learning environment? Much has already been written about the constraints to technology adoption in higher education and the factors contributing the digital divide between developed and developed countries (Nye, 2015; West, 2015; Thomas et al., 2013).\n\nLatest research work conducted by International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the GSMA Digital Inclusion in Latin America and The Caribbean Report, 2016, speaks to the concerns about “digital inclusion” for developing country institutions with the incorporation of 5 G, IOT, cloud and edge computing in learning and other spheres of life (ITU Report, 2019; GSMA Intelligence Report, 2016).\n\nDigital inclusion is especially important for developing economies to meet vital sustainable development goals (SDGs) pertaining to the attainment of basic health, educational, social and economic objectives of lesser developed states. Concerns about access, affordability, pricing of more sophisticated and higher quality technology brings into sharper focus the challenges faced by developing states (Noll et al., 2018).\n\nOver the past five years, a number of innovative initiatives have been implemented by regional institutions to integrate mobile technologies at tertiary level. Many of these spearheaded by the UWI’s Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, which have deployed deliberate strategies to continually sensitize teachers to new “innovative pedagogical strategies incorporating twenty-first-century technology.” Recent focus has been on the use of collaborative and cooperative learning approaches to achieve higher learning outcomes.\n\nExamples of specific approaches to introducing technology tools include workshops, presentations, and round table discussions on the use of Skype and Google apps in teaching and group work monitoring, using Web 2.0 technologies (e.g. blogs, wikis, podcasts, social networking) and mobile learning techniques in classroom setting. In addition, there has been much sensitization by the university’s information technology services department (MITS) about the impact of new media technologies in higher education (UWI, Centre for Excellence T&L, 2014).\n\nFindings\n\nThe results of our study revealed a number of interesting findings. Students’ perception regarding cellphone use as a learning tool was generally positive. In 10 of the 12 (83 per cent) questions posed returned a more favorable than unfavorable rating regarding its adoption. A number of important patterns or trends emerged, which contributed to students’ views. We see from Figure 12 that students place the greatest premium on mobile phone use for collaborating (84 per cent), communicating (75 per cent) and seeking teacher assistance (79 per cent).\n\nThis finding confirms previous research studies, which attest that students view the adoption of cellphone in classroom environment as an important collaboration, communication, accessing and information sharing. Students place a high priority on its use as a source of greater interaction and encouraging higher levels of engagement. In addition, they leveraging cellphone technology features as a means to a complement and enrich the learning experience and collaborate outside the classroom (Biddix et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2015).\n\nAlthough less research has been conducted in developing countries, we find that the study confirms that students in this region are no different in displaying their worldwide affinity and comfort with the use of mobile technology. Also similar to findings in developed countries, we find that a strong awareness of the rules regarding restrictions on use of cellphones in class at 90 per cent with lesser support agreeing to the fairness of the policies and sanctions imposed for breaching the guidelines. The author is not surprised about students’ knowledge of the guidelines and policies while registering strong opposition with restrictions placed on the use of cellphones at any time.\n\nThis researcher was somewhat surprised to find more students returning unfavorable (55 per cent) response to the use of cellphone for submitting assignments to teachers. This author would have expected that as a student-initiated tool, it would have been perceived as a means of fostering greater levels of student-teacher engagement.\n\nHowever, this affirms earlier studies in developed countries that students in this part of the world also place greater priority on its use as a social connectivity, social networking and communication tool, which can be used in any context at any time, often “blurring the lines between formal and informal learning” (Pedro et al., 2018).\n\nFor Caribbean students and the majority of mobile phone users in the developing world, portability and affordability are especially unique advantages, and is vital for maintaining important business, customer and personal “linkups” (Horst, 2006; Horst et al., 2005).\n\nImplications and recommendations\n\nAdvances in technology will continue to unravel higher education systems. Education policymakers will have to continuously rethink their pedagogies and models in the age of technology and the digital revolution. We see from the survey results that students are more responsive to using cell phones along with learning methods, which enhance communication, collaboration and sharing of learning experiences.\n\nMore importantly, mobile technology is making demands on the system for learning styles, which are more highly personalized and customized to the learners needs. Learning is increasingly taking place outside formal learning environments, and hence, institutions will have to adjust to this new shift in delivery methods.\n\nCurrently, what also seems to be evolving are rapid shifts in the nature of the global economy with the emergence of “on demand, collaborative, sharing economies” along with advances in digital and mobile technologies (5 G wireless, mobile cloud computing, etc.), which is creating an intersection between learning, technology and economic systems.\n\nThere is the view that higher learning institutions will have to build strong educational ecosystems driven by technology to meet the needs of this “on demand economy” and specifically to cater to young millennial and Generation Z students’ demand for educational services, which are personalized and customizable. At one extreme end, is a vision of future learning pedagogies based on “platform learning” (Means, 2018) using mobile tech and other advances to integrate “on demand learning” and “on demand work” for this new economic system.\n\nOthers view the integrating newer advances in technology (smart technologies) with existing pedagogical frameworks but developed in a more seamless fashion (smart pedagogies) as the solution to deliver more student centric, socially collaborative, self-directed learning styles. For our purposes, regional higher institutions must have the ability to access and leverage advances in mobile technology irrespective of our economic, social or institutional strictures to reap the benefits of high-quality learning systems.\n\nIntegrating mobile technology with learning methods, which emphasize self- directed, lifelong and flexible learning while augmenting these with some degree of instructor led activities can lead to significant savings and value without compromising on quality educational outcomes if the following strategies are integrated (Cuesta Medina, 2018):\n\nEnsure that teachers acquire new teaching skills, which emphasize interaction and assessment of students.\n\nTeachers should adopt more the role of facilitator, and maintain effective “facilitator-student” metrics.\n\nInstitutions must have monitoring and assessment mechanisms to measure learning outcomes over time.\n\nWith respect to newer technologies, 5 G mobile wireless technology presents an especially pressing concern for developing countries. Some innovative initiatives to ensure greater digital inclusion and sustainable development goals with respect to education should be considered.\n\nFor instance, the “internet light” concept (Noll et al., 2018) introduced via a partnership between more developed western European counties and some African countries, uses network slicing of distributed network systems to share certain content (e.g. educational material). Caribbean institutions could also consider increasing using such partnership initiatives as cost-effective ways to ensure mobile digital inclusion with the advent of new technologies.\n\nThe future of higher education is changing where new methods are being used to engage Millennials in business (e.g. CSR) and in education (e.g. artificial intelligence and other technologies) (Ahmad, 2019c; 2020; forthcoming-a, b). I close with the thought that the future of “classrooms” would have students sitting from different departments trying to solve problems using their interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial approach."
