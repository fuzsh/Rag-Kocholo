        "text": "What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?\n\nThe Internet of Things, or IoT, is a network of physical devices. These devices can transfer data to one another without human intervention. IoT devices are not limited to computers or machinery. The Internet of Things can include anything with a sensor that is assigned a unique identifier (UID). The primary goal of the IoT is to create self-reporting devices that can communicate with each other (and users) in real time.\n\nInternet of Things examples\n\nYou likely use IoT devices every day. The list below outlines a few IoT devices that you may be familiar with:\n\nSmart home devices. Smart devices are interactive electronics that use wireless connections to understand user instructions. To an extent, smart home devices like thermostats and home security systems can work autonomously to assist with daily tasks. For example, you may program your smart thermostat to adjust automatically to a cooler setting before you arrive home from work. Or, you may receive a security camera notification to inform you that someone is at the door when you are not home.Â\n\nWearable technologies. One of the most common Internet of Things examples is smartwatches. Wearable IoT technology like Fitbits and Apple Watches connect to other devices (like your smartphone) to share data. They typically also connect to the internet to track GPS locations.Â\n\nPersonal medical devices. Personal medical devices like pacemakers are also IoT devices. Remote medical devices can help monitor and share a patient's vital signs or detect early signs of health issues for fast intervention.Â\n\nAutonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars and other connected vehicles rely on the internet to share real-time information. Sensors throughout the vehicle help map its surroundings, transmit camera footage, and respond to traffic signals.\n\nInterested in building your own IoT device? Try the University of Colorado Boulderâs online program, Hands-On Internet of Things.\n\n3 types of IoT applications\n\nBillions of devices are connected to the internet, collecting and sharing information with one another. They range from smart home setups like cooking appliances and smoke detectors to military-grade surveillance equipment. The list below outlines a few of the most common types of IoT applications.\n\n1. Consumer IoT\n\nConsumer IoT refers to personal and wearable devices that connect to the internet. These devices are often referred to as smart devices.\n\n2. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)\n\nThe industrial Internet of Things is the system of interconnected devices in the industrial sector. Manufacturing machinery and devices used for energy management are a part of the industrial Internet of Things.Â\n\n3. Commercial IoT\n\nCommercial IoT refers to the tools and systems used outside of the home. For example, businesses and health care organizations leverage commercial IoT for auditable data trails and consumer management.Â\n\nHow does IoT work?\n\nThe next few sections break down the components that make the Internet of Things work.\n\nInternet of Things platform\n\nAn IoT platform manages device connectivity. It can be a software suite or a cloud service. The purpose of an IoT platform is to manage and monitor hardware, software, processing abilities, and application layers.Â\n\nSensor technologies\n\nIoT sensors, sometimes called smart sensors, convert real-world variables into data that devices can interpret and share. Many different types of sensors exist. For example, temperature sensors detect heat and convert temperature changes into data. Motion sensors detect movement by monitoring ultrasonic waves and triggering a desired action when those waves are interrupted.Â\n\nUnique identifiers\n\nThe core concept of the IoT is communication among devices and users. Unique identifiers (UIDs) establish the context of a device within the larger network to enable this communication. Identifiers are patterns, like numeric or alphanumeric strings. One example of a UID that you might be familiar with is an internet protocol (IP) address. They can identify a single device (instance identifier) or the class to which that device belongs (type identifier).\n\nInternet connectivity\n\nSensors can connect to cloud platforms and other devices through a host of network protocols for the internet.Â This enables communication between devices.Â\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) in IoT devices makes it easier for users to input information and interact with devices. One common example of an IoT device that utilizes NLP technology is the Amazon Alexa. Machine learning also enhances the analytical capabilities of IoT devices.\n\nEdge computing\n\nEdge computing is a computing framework. It aims to conserve resources and speed up response time by moving computational resources like data storage closer to the data source. The IoT accomplishes this by utilizing edge devices like IoT gateways.\n\nBenefits of the Internet of Things\n\nBefore the introduction of the IoT, devices could only collect and share information with human interaction. Today, the IoT enables lower operational costs, increased safety and productivity, and overall improved customer experience. Here are a few notable pros of the Internet of Things:\n\nAutomation. Removing the need to perform mundane tasks like turning the thermostat on and off or locking doors increases efficiency and quality of life.\n\nConservation. Automation makes it easier to manage energy consumption and water usage without human oversight or error.\n\nBig data analytics. Information that was previously difficult to collect and analyze can be tracked effortlessly with the Internet of Things.\n\nYou can learn more about how the IoT benefits certain industries in the sections below.Â\n\nThe Internet of Things in health care\n\nThe IoT helps decrease the need for traditional record-keeping and protects patients with real-time alerts. For example, glucose monitors can alert the patient or caretaker when glucose levels become problematic and prompt the appropriate action.\n\nThe Internet of Things in business\n\nThe IoT is essential to business. It makes it possible to collect and analyze massive amounts of data in real time. IoT devices also enable automation. They allow people to gain more control over their environments, health, and even safety. For example, smart home security systems can automatically assess threats like burglary or carbon monoxide poisoning and call for help.\n\nPotential drawbacks of IoT\n\nManaging large amounts of data poses certain risks and disadvantages. For example, more IoT devices mean more human intervention through network and device monitoring. Some security researchers believe that cybersecurity professionals may face an increased workload as the IoT grows. Here are a few more potential drawbacks of the Internet of Things:\n\nPrivacy concerns. It can be challenging to protect the data mined by IoT devices. Increased tracking threatens the confidentiality of the information we share over the internet.\n\nSecurity issues. Individual device security is left up to the manufacturers. Wireless network security could become compromised if manufacturers do not prioritize security measures.\n\nBandwidth. Too many connected devices on a shared network results in slow internet speeds.\n\nIoT jobs\n\nMany different career paths exist for someone who wants to work with the IoT. You can learn about a few of the most common job titles with the list below.\n\nTechnical IoT project manager. Technical IoT project managers provide organizations with technical expertise and team leadership. They also design and implement new methods to increase efficiency.\n\nRead more: What is a Technical Project Manager + How Do You Become One?\n\nIoT architect. IoT architects design and create IoT solutions to solve business problems.Â\n\nRead more: What Are Embedded Systems (+ How to Work with Them)\n\nIoT engineer. IoT engineers develop and manage IoT hardware, software, platforms, and systems.Â\n\nDo you want to learn more about IoT development or prepare for a career in IoT?
