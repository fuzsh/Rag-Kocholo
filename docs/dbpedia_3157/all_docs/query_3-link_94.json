        "text": "Our pick\n\nThe most responsive of all the models we tested, the iQ3 uses geolocation technology (Bluetooth and GPS) to automatically open and close the door.\n\nBuying Options\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Control4, Crestron, Google Home, Home Assistant, Hubitat, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings\n\nHow it helps: An auto-close feature can automatically shut your garage door if it’s left open for too long (which you can adjust). You can bypass that option if you’re hanging outside for a short period of time, or just opt for Night Mode, which automatically closes the door at a set time every evening if it has been left open.\n\nWhy it’s a pick: The Tailwind iQ3 Smart Automatic Garage Controller combines a hardwired door sensor and geolocation technology to reliably open and close the door automatically whenever you approach or leave your home. It also works with many smart-home platforms, as well as all sorts of existing garage-door openers.\n\nAnother option to consider: We’re still looking for an off-the-shelf solution that can remotely open and close the door to your house, as well as doors in and around your home. A few people we spoke with recommended Open Sesame, which is a professionally installed system that we have not tested. “Just opening my damn door is probably one of the most important things in the world for me,” said Mackay, who is an avid outdoorsman. “Just being able to come and go [easily], that is the biggest thing for me.”\n\nSmart sensors\n\nSmart sensors are little gadgets that detect activity or conditions around your home, including movement, temperature, air quality, and the like, and then alert you (or tell other devices to trigger). A contact sensor on your window can notify you if it is opened or closed—and it could also tell a siren to sound. Motion sensors keep tabs on movement in and around your house and could be used to turn lights on or off, or they might trigger a camera or an alarm.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis tiny motion sensor is cheap and works well. It does require an Aqara Hub, not included.\n\nBuying Options\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, IFTTT\n\nHow it helps: Smart sensors can easily be placed just about anywhere in your home, and depending on their function, they can be an assistant or a sentry. A motion sensor will send an alert whenever it detects movement, whatever direction you point it at, and you can link it with other security-related devices, like an alarm system. But it can also be configured to trigger other non-security devices, making it singularly useful: Set one in the living room, and have the lights come on at night whenever someone enters (and then automatically shut off later). Or have the TV come on when you enter the den.\n\nWhy it’s a pick: If you’re planning to get a home security system, such as Ring, SimpliSafe, or Abode, buy the sensors that work with that specific system. Otherwise, the Aqara Motion Sensor P1 is a great all-around option because it works quickly and reliably, and its companion app makes it simple to set up and use. It’s also cheap enough that you can add more than one around the house.\n\nAqara’s sensors are especially reliable because they rely on Zigbee wireless, which adds range and reliability—so you never have to worry about Wi-Fi dead spots. (This also means you’ll need a hub like the Aqara Smart Hub M2.) Once you have the hub, you can connect additional sensors, including the Aqara Temperature and Humidity Sensor and the Aqara Door and Window Sensor.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis sensor is smaller and cheaper than a lot of other contact sensors, and it works reliably. But it does require the use of an Aqara Hub.\n\nBuying Options\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, IFTTT\n\nHow it helps: The Aqara Door and Window Sensor sends word whenever something is opened or closed, be it a medicine cabinet, a front door, a basement window, or an attach hatch. When something is opened, it will trigger a smartphone alert, and it can also set off a siren in the Aqara Hub (not included). Because this works with all of the major voice platforms, you can check on status via voice commands, or tie it into other smart-home devices to get visual and audio alerts from smart speakers and smart lights.\n\nWhy it’s a pick: The Aqara Door and Window Sensor is one of the smallest and cheapest contact sensors we’ve tested, so it is easier to mount on doors, windows, and drawers. It’s also very reliable, thanks to wireless Zigbee technology (this also requires installing an Aqara Hub, which can support up to 128 sensors).\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit (with a compatible base station), Google Home, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings\n\nHow it helps: Being able to keep a clear eye around your home—and share it with a caretaker or loved one—provides tremendous peace of mind. The Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera can accurately determine whether that motion is a person, animal, car, or package. Arlo also offers a 24/7 recording option, which ensures that you have a full record of anyone who comes by your home at any time (enabling requires a pricier subscription and extra equipment).\n\nWhy it’s a pick: The Arlo Pro 4 Wi-Fi camera combines clear 2K video and can record up to five minutes of continuous motion. Currently, it’s only sold in multi-packs, which are more expensive and also require a pricier Arlo Secure subscription as a result. For $13 per month, you’ll get support for unlimited cameras, the ability to record clips, and the cameras gain the ability to distinguish between people, pets, packages, and vehicles. It runs on a rechargeable battery, but if you live in a high-traffic area, you may find yourself charging it monthly. If that’s the case, consider buying an extra battery, a solar panel, or hardwiring the camera via an outdoor cable.\n\nHome security systems\n\nA home security system can help prevent break-ins. But it also includes sensors that remind you when a door or window has been left open, cameras that can notify you when a caretaker is coming and going, and smoke detectors that alert you if there’s a fire (or eggs are burning in the pan). Some systems also offer other helpful add-ons, including water sensors, keypads, key fobs, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons—all of which you can access via a single app (instead of juggling several).\n\nWe strongly recommend adding a professional monitoring plan to any security system, so that in the event of an alarm, a live person from a call center will alert you, your loved ones, and anyone else you deem an emergency contact. The call center can also contact the police or fire department if needed, or if no one can be reached.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis system works with almost every type of security accessory, offers options for power and internet backup, and has a built-in Wi-Fi 6 router.\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Works With Ring\n\nHow it helps: The Ring Alarm Pro includes a built-in Eero Wi-Fi 6 router, which should boost the speed and range of your home internet network. And the base of the Ring system has a battery that supplies 24 hours of backup power (which can be boosted for another 24 hours via add-on power packs).\n\nWhy it’s a pick: Ring’s sensors perform great, and the company offers more types of indoor and outdoor camera add-ons than any other system we’ve tested. It also offers the biggest bang for your buck when it comes to professional monitoring ($20 per month or $200 per year).\n\nThe monthly monitoring subscription includes internet backup, so if your power goes out or your home internet service goes down, you’ll continue to have access via a cellular connection. That lets you keep the system online and continue to have functioning security cameras, and you can also access the internet for email or services like Netflix (up to 3GB; otherwise it’s $3 per 1 GB).\n\nAlso great\n\nAbode has a number of useful accessories; it’s also compatible with a range of third-party devices, as well as all major smart-home platforms.\n\nBuying Options\n\nCompatible with: Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and others\n\nHow it helps: Abode Smart Security Kit takes a bit more technical know-how and requires Abode’s subscription plan (starting at $7 per month or $70 per year), but this DIY system is compatible with far more smart-home devices than any other.\n\nWhy it’s a pick: The Abode Smart Security Kit works with smart lighting, thermostats, voice control, and pretty much every other kind of smart-home device. Abode also offers a lot of add-ons, including several types of sensors, cameras, and a smoke-alarm monitor that works in conjunction with your existing UL-listed smoke detector.\n\nSmart water-leak detectors\n\nAbout one in 50 US households each year file an insurance claim related to water-damage incidents, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Those often happen in hard-to-reach areas like the basement, by the water heater, or behind the washing machine. Smart water-leak sensors can alert you the instant water is detected by sending an alert to your smartphone. And some also emit an audible alarm or can trigger lights and sounds so you can tackle small leaks before they become a big headache.\n\nOur pick\n\nThe plug-in hub has a loud (94 dB) siren and an optional sensor cable, and it can connect to up to 16 battery-powered remote sensors.\n\nCompatible with: Google Home, IFTTT\n\nHow it helps: A good leak sensor ensures you are made aware of detected water, even if you aren’t home or nearby. The best models have a loud alarm and the ability to integrate with smart-home platforms so you can receive smart alerts. We also prefer when alerts can be silenced in the app, so you don’t need to physically access the detector (or wade through water) to silence an alarm.\n\nWhy it’s a pick: With a 94 dB alarm built into the plug-in hub, the D-Link DCH-S1621KT is the loudest one of our picks. That hub includes an optional sensor cable to detect water around the hub, but the system can also monitor up to 16 other locations using add-on battery-powered sensors.\n\nWhen water is present, the alarm and smartphone alerts can be silenced in the app, but it can’t be turned off—so if water is still present, it will keep alerting you. If that’s a concern, opt for the Flo by Moen Smart Leak Detector, which can be turned off at the device or in the app. It can also detect temperature, but it doesn’t have a loud audible alarm and doesn’t integrate with any smart-home platforms."
