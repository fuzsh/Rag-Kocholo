        "text": "Read about aids that might help with different types of memory problems.\n\nPeople with memory problems have suggested some of the following aids to help remember things. You might think of them as different tools for tackling different problems. You may have already used some of them.\n\nLook for aids that fit with the skills you already have. For example, if you have never used a reminder function on your mobile phone, you may find it difficult to start using it now.\n\nAn occupational therapist can offer practical advice. For more expensive items, you might be able to ‘try before you buy’ – perhaps from an ‘assisted living’ shop on the high street or a disabled living centre. Contact your local authority for details of your nearest centre, or see the Disabled Living Foundation.\n\nIf you are not able to see a product before buying it, there might be online videos which show people using and reviewing the item. Whatever aids you use, people around you can support you to use them.\n\nCommon memory aids\n\nOther useful memory aids\n\nFree Helpcards\n\nOur free helpcards can make it easier to get help or assistance when you're out in the community.\n\nFind out more\n\nThink this page could be useful to someone?
