        "text": "Introduction:\n\nWe have seen tremendous progress in understanding cancer biology and this has led to record number of new drug approvals for cancer. Patients with cancer continue to experience high rate of symptoms from their tumor in the form of fatigue, pain, decreased appetite, low mood or disturbed sleep. Cancer treatments are also associated with toxicity, which can negatively impact outcomes. Clinicians and researchers have struggled to measure these symptoms, as existing tools do not reflect true patient experiences. Current clinical tools have two major limitations. They are 1) difficult to reproduce across different clinical scenarios, 2) unable to measure or report symptoms in real time. In recent years we have seen growth in mobile health technology in all fields of medicine including oncology. In this article, we look to describe how modern day mobile and wearable technology is changing the way we offer clinical care and perform clinical research. We discuss a new brand of multidisciplinary care that is evolving around mobile health devices and present a vision of up and coming technology in this space."
