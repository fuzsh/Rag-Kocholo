Measure speed, height and distance\n\nHave you wanted to get your hands on a radar gun, like the ones use by baseball scouts or the police?

Monitor your heart rate\n\nSome newer smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S 7, have integrated heart-rate monitors.\n\nBut there are also apps compatible with a number of smartphones that allow you to measure your heart rate.
