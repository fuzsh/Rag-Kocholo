Last month the Nerdio team got together for our annual kickoff meeting and I was surprised, humbled and honored to receive the Rookie of the Year award. This award means a lot to me - not just for the group recognition itself, but also because it reflects the relationships I’ve built with my peers and leaders throughout the company over the last nine months. A special shoutout to Michele Spirk for introducing me to Nerdio and to Carl Long, Kevin Murray, Tony Cai ☁, and Will Ominsky for being wonderful mentors and collaborators. Here’s to 2024🎉 - the name of the game is to keep the momentum going and to keep doing great things!
