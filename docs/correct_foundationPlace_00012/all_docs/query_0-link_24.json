        "text": "The New Cloud Provider Paradigm and Changes for Enterprise IT.\n\nWithin three years, many enterprises estimate as much as 50% of enterprise production workloads will migrate to top tier Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) hyperscale cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft (Azure) as well as speciality niche providers similar to Virtustream. Now that a few providers dominate the current consolidated ecosystem, enterprises and systems integrators (SIs) face new challenges from the growth of hyperscale clouds. Also, this article outlines details on the major cloud providers, their history, and why there are only a few major IaaS players left (see timeline from 2006–2017 below).\n\nSome Perspective\n\nAs the public cloud ecosystem consolidates, hyperscale cloud providers continue to advance the rapid migration, deployment, and management of advanced IT initiatives for enterprise organizations, their next frontier. Hyperscale cloud providers are spending heavily in data centers, networks, and products to scale globally and continuously innovate services targeted for enterprise customers. The top providers control 65% of the public cloud IaaS market share (AWS 42%, IBM, CPG, Azure 23%) and spent $31.5 billion on capital expenses and leases last year. Niche and speciality providers represent 35% of the market. The global hyperscale platforms, engineered for rapid auto-provisioning and auto-scaling of massive compute resources, now go far beyond traditional on-premises systems. Hyperscale computing is the key enabler of the mega cloud providers, developing new types of application platforms (Internet of Things — IoT, Machine Learning — ML) broadly deployed within larger pools of cloud infrastructures.\n\nEnterprise IT Will Not be Fired by Using a Hyperscale Provider\n\nRather than risking capital expense and development resources, enterprises are utilizing global hyperscale cloud providers at an increasing rate for their strategic “cloud first” and “multi-cloud” initiatives. The transition to public cloud by enterprises will be rapid. Survey data from a 2016 Cloud Comparison Index indicates enterprise customers expect over 30% of their workloads will move to hyperscale cloud providers by 2020. While these figures represent conservative projections by IT leaders, subsequent feedback after the survey indicates that the number could grow up to 50%.\n\nSIs are also experiencing changes in public cloud buying habits by enterprises. The high-growth of the As-a-Service segment continues to gain additional momentum as traditional sourcing is undergoing market changes. From a recent Q4 2016 Index Report for global combined full‐year annual contract value (ACV), Infrastructure-as-a-Service grew 54% over the 2015 performance. The high percentage gains further establish the ongoing enterprise workload shift happening from on-premises to hyperscale cloud providers.\n\nAs hyperscale cloud usage increases, enterprise IT leaders are now faced with continued decisions surrounding production workloads that will either be developed on or migrated to a selected hyperscale cloud provider or niche provider. Many companies are announcing “all in” programs related to their cloud migration strategy. For example, Time Inc. with an audience of 120 million subscribers is migrating five global data centers to eliminate the need to manage and provision infrastructure. Similarly, The New York Times plans to shut down three of four leased data center facilities as it shifts major production workloads to multiple hyperscale providers. In addition to the rapid move to public cloud, niche providers will remain utilized by enterprise organizations for their specialty application services, skills, contract flexibility, and support. Sabre, the travel data and analytics service, chose SAP focused enterprise cloud provider Virtustream to manage their internal SAP solution. AWS hosts all of Sabre’s customer-facing applications; however Sabre estimated costs of 15 additional full time staff to host and manage the SAP solution on the AWS platform.\n\nInitial drivers that pushed enterprises to public cloud included cost savings, improved service levels, ease of use, and other competitive firms utilizing these services. In today’s high volume, low margin environment, price cuts amongst the hyperscale cloud providers continues to drive IT adoption and provider consolidation. As cloud adoption increases, enterprises now seek to financially regulate and throttle cloud costs across multiple cloud services, especially where applications are designed and configured with virtually unlimited sizing capabilities. Companies similar to Cloudyn (recently acquired by Azure) and CloudHealth are trying to help solve this issue. IT leaders must consider and prepare for the new hyperscale cloud future relevant to their organization. Three key foundational components driving adoption include:\n\n· Innovation and Speed: In-house developers and shadow IT teams initially bypassed slower internal approval processes for DevOps by utilizing hyperscale cloud services for ease of use, provisioning, and billing. In order to compete with the speed of change by consumers requiring modern digital experiences and self-service, adoption of hyperscale cloud increased execution speed, agility, and ability to deliver innovation rapidly. As future hyperscale cloud services are implemented, IT organizations will increase their role as drivers of new technology and strategic innovation for their respective organizations.\n\n· New Technologies at Scale: Hyperscale cloud providers responded to developer needs and increasing requirements from enterprise organizations by scaling out their services. The amount of investment by hyperscale cloud providers in data centers, networks, and new disruptive services dramatically outpaces cloud spend by individual enterprises. Compute, storage, database, security, identity, compliance, migration tools, and cloud management tools are products and services receiving research and development dollars for continuous innovation. Analysts predict hyperscale cloud providers currently represent over 45% of total global compute capacity, which is likely to be closer to 65% in five years. Additionally, disruptive technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics, container systems, IoT, and mobile services enable enterprise organizations to quickly test new services with very low risk. Hyperscale cloud providers have a flywheel effect where enterprise organizations adopt additional services beyond IaaS once in the platform. Services include PaaS, data warehousing, serverless computing, and additional services offered by partners within the provider ecosystem.\n\n· Enterprise Talent Transformation: The adoption of cloud services has also increased the demand for talent experienced in provisioning and managing hyperscale cloud environments for the enterprise. With more compute power moving to hyperscale providers, enterprise IT teams are being restructured to account for the new talent required to manage and deliver current and future hyperscale cloud services. As the focus shifts to managing cloud-delivered capacity effectively across multiple clouds, IT teams are transformation into new roles. Additionally, Managed Service Providers (MSPs) are assisting organizations make the transition and supply staff where necessary.\n\nSIs and technology providers are also acquiring for talent while undergoing their own disruption. Accenture, Deloitte, and WiPro are all making moves to bring on board cloud native MSPs that do not have their own data center baggage.\n\n1) Deloitte Expands Cloud Services with Acquisition. 2) Wipro to acquire Appirio, A Global Cloud Services Company 3) Accenture Completes Acquisition of Cloud Sherpas, Strengthening Enterprise Cloud Capabilities 4) Datapipe Acquires AWS Consulting and Professional Services Expert DualSpark\n\nSome Advice\n\nAs the enterprise strategy shifts at a faster pace, IT leaders and decision makers will accelerate internal plans due to the business pressures to transform. Plans include the migration of on-premises production workloads as well as deployment of cloud-native applications. As the evolution continues within the enterprise, IT leaders must consider three key action items regarding hyperscale cloud services:\n\n1. Understanding hyperscale products and services. Getting up to speed on offerings from hyperscale cloud and niche providers and their associated ecosystems requires serious diligence to the rapid scale of innovation and product announcements. Internal strategic advisors need to understand the offerings due to the large opportunity in helping corporate divisions understand what is possible relevant to their products and transformational roadmaps. Moving beyond virtualization and hosting, enterprise organizations now use and test next wave technologies offered by top providers. These products and services include data analytics, machine learning, cloud APIs, cloud video intelligence, storage, containers, microservices, and management tools.\n\n2. Determine the applications that can benefit. As part of the IT roadmap, identifying the prioritized applications that can benefit from hyperscale cloud platforms, either from on-premises or cloud to cloud migration is a major step on the transformation journey. Cost comparison exercises and additional product understanding through the right providers and advisors can determine the respective product fit, service, or location. Determining the security capability by the provider for the targeted applications also reduces migration friction and leadership concerns. In short, the organization can move faster on their journey when the appropriate applications ready for transformation (security, cost, availability, location) are identified in the priority list. Select service providers and trusted cloud native advisors that are heavily invested in the success of the enterprise can build and execute application priority lists with IT managers.\n\n3. Compare the costs. As part of a transformation exercise and evaluation of current data centers, workloads, and applications, we recommend IT leaders continually compare costs for between on-premises and hyperscale cloud. New online pricing tools and cost comparison calculators are available to help organization estimate potential savings. Cloud Comparison Index research can assist decision makers with general understanding of workload costs between hyperscale cloud providers by sample small, medium, and large workload sizes. While not the key driver for public cloud adoption, once within a service, comparing pricing in collaboration with the CFO team is vital to cost management and transparency.\n\nBy undertaking these action items, IT managers will lead their organizational ability to transform and decipher security, compliance, privacy, and governance requirements unique to their large and complex organizations and match those requirements with hyperscale cloud providers best suited for their workloads. Additionally, hyperscale cloud adoption also plays a key role for IT leaders and their ability to drive relevancy and strategic innovation for customers and employees.\n\nThe Consolidated Ecosystem — How Did We Get Here?\n\nThere have been many entries and exits in the public cloud space, especially exits in the last three years. To provide context and commentary on the ecosystem, the below information provides background on some of the major players on the timeline from 2006–2017.\n\nAWS:\n\nLaunched in 2006, Amazon is the IaaS leader controlling 42% of the market. A recent interview with Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy sums up why they were able to gain such a huge lead. “I think there’s a second category of large technology companies that just took an ungodly long time to get there. These are companies like Oracle and IBM, some of those folks. I think for them the model that we were pursuing, in the cloud, was so disruptive to their core businesses. The margin structures are radically different.”\n\nThere is much published on Amazon’s rise and this article summarizes it well — “Amazon’s profitless path to world domination https://qz.com/987559/charted-amazons-amzn-profitless-path-to-world-domination-over-the-past-20-years/.\" To follow the AWS enterprise strategy, Steven Orban also does a nice job documenting the enterprise migration case studies related to the massive AWS product & services portfolio and the Cloud Adoption Framework.\n\nTakeaway: Simply stated, CB Insights profile of Amazon’s current HR staffing / open job listing by business unit (above) shows the AWS segment as their largest focus where they plan to hire. Look for all the new major announcement at AWS re:Invent 2017 November 27, Las Vegas https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\n\nAzure:\n\nCommercially released in 2010, in addition to public cloud offerings, Microsoft’s current strategy and focus is delivering the Azure Stack hybrid service designed to help organizations enable Azure services inside their own data centers. Bringing the cloud to the enterprise allows big companies to maintain control using on-premises network security, monitoring as well as solve for data sovereignty, privacy regulations, governance and regulatory compliance issues.\n\nTakeaway: Azure, IBM, and GCP combined account for 23% of the total market. As the second largest public cloud provider globally, Microsoft has big momentum and expectations with their Azure Stack product. This places them squarely in competition with VMware and AWS with the VMware Cloud Foundation partnership. Next announcements are planned at the Microsoft Ignite conference September 25, 2017 in Orlando. https://ignite.microsoft.com. Update: The Azure team just acquired Cloudyn, a multi-cloud management service based in Israel to help customers manage cloud costs with Azure, AWS, and also Azure Stack.\n\nDatapipe:\n\nIn 2010, Datapipe announced their Managed Cloud for Amazon Web Services. In addition to running their own cloud and data centers, Datapipe was one of the first cloud service providers to pivot to managed services with AWS, led by Partnerships and Strategy VP Ed Laczynski. Since then Datapipe has performed two acquisitions of AWS focused MSPs including Adapt UK Aug. 2016 and Dualspark Sept. 2015. Moving away from public cloud offerings, Datapipe works now on enterprise related specialty cloud services and GOV deals as well as managed services with Azure, Alibaba, and AWS. Datapipe is also focused on global cloud regulations and compliance for large cloud related projects. https://www.datapipe.com/blog/2017/04/13/navigating-the-muddied-global-compliance-waters/\n\nTakeaway: With their managed service focus, enterprise organizations will trust smaller organizations like Datapipe for independent guidance, global compliance, and multi-cloud coordination.\n\nDell:\n\nDell discontinued its OpenStack and VMware vCloud-based public cloud back in 2013 and Dell Cloud Manager, their multi-cloud management product in 2016. They smartly acquired EMC, the largest tech acquisition of all time ($67B in 2015). Inside the EMC family, Dell assumed Virtustream, VMware, and Pivotal, offering highly diverse cloud products. Virtustream has never deviated from their enterprise and federal niche cloud position, focusing on solving critical application needs for global enterprise organizations. With their SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud, they offer specific SLAs, global data centers, regulatory compliance, product expertise, and managed services to attract companies to their cloud. At the recent #DellEMCWorld conference in Vegas, Virtustream re-emphasized their SAP expertise message with CEO Rodney Rodgers and alliance with Deloitte. Virtustream is also now part of the Dell EMC Partner Program, extending their cloud and storage services to Dell partners.\n\nTakeaway: Dell’s numerous cloud strategies will take them in various directions including the Azure Stack business partnership with pre-configured Dell servers and EMC networking, VMware’s partnership with AWS, and Pivotal working closely with Google Cloud Platform. Look for Virtustream to be the steady service provider for enterprise cloud needs.\n\nIBM:\n\nIn 2013, IBM acquired SoftLayer to help them transform their cloud offerings. In 2017 it retired the SoftLayer brand and changed their cloud strategy to higher margin services, including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain where they are leaders. While still offering the Bluemix PaaS and public IaaS, the focus is cognitive computing and not to compete solely on price against AWS, Google, and Azure. IBM recently announced it is enforcing a new “No Work From Home” policy as a way to trim their workforce without having to officially announce a RIF.\n\nTakeaway: IBM will win where they perform best. Large customized speciality services for healthcare, manufacturing, and other industries. Better for them to focus on fewer meaningful/profitable deals vs transactional smaller margin IaaS services.\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform:\n\nIn 2013, Google announced their formal entry into the public cloud IaaS space. They drifted for a few years until Google re-invented its cloud platform sales and services organization under the leadership of former VMware CEO Dianne Greene. To attract more enterprise business and IT customers, Google now focuses on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) cloud solutions to compete with IBM and Microsoft. Additionally, Google is working hard to expand their global data centers and enhance their appeal to traditional enterprise buyers eliminating confusion with past offerings and branding. Bertrand Yansouni, formerly with VMware under Greene, is working to expand GCP’s global partner ecosystem to challenge Microsoft and Amazon. GCP has also partnered Nutanix to help them compete with Azure’s hybrid strategy. The new service will allow enterprise companies to move applications from private to the public cloud with their appliance.\n\nTakeaway: Google’s cloud marketshare will keep increasing as enterprises awaken to their machine learning capabilities. Trust will be their biggest obstacle as their younger, more inexperienced workforce tries to capture more lucrative and longer term deals. They are smart to partner with SAP (Announced in March at CloudNext 2017) and other enterprise related software providers as their teams become more proficient and application specific to compete with AWS. Look for a new data center campus next to Apple, Tesla, and Switch Supernap in Nevada by the Gigafactory.\n\nAT&T:\n\nAT&T sold their managed cloud services to IBM in 2015. In addition, AT&T offloaded their public cloud services and applications to Oracle. AT&T originally provided their Integrated Cloud (AIC) to their enterprise customers. Like the other major telecommunications providers, their exit confirms the competitive market share, global capital expense, and product depth of the hyperscale cloud leaders is extremely hard to keep up with.\n\nTakeaway: AT&T is better off partnering with IBM and others for cloud related services allowing them to focus on their core telecommunications competencies.\n\nRackspace\n\nIn 2014 Rackspace announced their pivot to focus on managed services rather than a sole strategy on IaaS offerings. Continuing on that path, they announced their AWS partnership at re:Invent 2015 and Google partnership at CloudNext 2017. For Rackspace, competing with AWS, Azure, or GCP on product and data center investments was no longer feasible. Aug. 2016, Rackspace was sold to Apollo Global Management for $4.3B and is now privately owned again. Taylor Rhodes, the former CEO resigned in May and is now with Chicago-based company, SMS Assist.\n\nTakeaway: Rackspace will continue to build their expertise with enterprise software through acquisitions and growth of their professional services organization. With their recent acquisition of Tricore, they can now focus on core ERP applications like SAP and Oracle. This provider trend for specialization is very popular currently.\n\nCentury Link:\n\nMay 2017, CenturyLink sold their data centers to Cyxtera in order to combine colocation services with enterprise security offerings. The entire Cyxtera management team is comprised of the former leadership of Terremark (Medina Capital), who sold the cloud service to Verizon in 2011. CenturyLink now owns 10% of Cyxtera. Prior to the sale to Cyxtera, CenturyLink had pivoted to offer multi-cloud management with AWS, Google, and others. CenturyLink previously acquired Tier3 and Savvis to build their strategy, but like other telecom providers, their plan going forward is centered on telecom related offerings.\n\nTakeaway: The Level 3 acquisition made the sale of their data centers necessary. Look for more details on where they are headed at this point but would follow the growth of Cyxtera who will do well at scaling their data center services.\n\nVerizon:\n\nIntertwined with the CenturyLink story, Verizon acquired Terremark in 2011 for $1.4B. Equinix then paid $3.6B for 24 of the telco’s data center sites in 2016. The remains of the Terremark cloud services were then sold to IBM in May 2017.\n\nTakeaway: Similar to AT&T, Verizon is better off partnering with IBM and others for cloud related services allowing them to focus on their core telecommunications competencies and acquisition of Yahoo. Verizon plans to cut 2,100 jobs at Yahoo after the merger with AOL.\n\nHP:\n\nOctober 2015, HP announced they were ending their HP Helion Public Cloud service to focus on interoperability with AWS, Google, and Azure. May 2016, HP and CSC announced a merger with HP Enterprise to create DXC Technology. With 170,000 global employees, US$25 billion in annual sales, and 6000 enterprise and public sector clients across 70 countries, they will continue to provide cloud related services, just not within the public cloud arena.\n\nTakeaway: The HP/CSC focus will be busy on integration, cost cutting, and staff reductions in 2017.\n\nJoyant:\n\nIn June 2016, Joyant sold to Samsung. To help back their Smarthings IoT acquisition and other services, Samsung was looking for the talent and service offerings to help with their next evolution. The Joyent team grew their Node.js public cloud services for the web.\n\nTakeaway: Renamed the Triton Cloud, Joyant still provides developer offerings but their focus now is on container systems and services.\n\nCisco:\n\nIn December 2016, Cisco announced the end of their $1B cloud service called Intercloud. In the announcement Cisco indicated they “evolved its cloud strategy from federating clouds to helping customers build and manage hybrid IT environments. Our cloud strategy centers on building and delivering secure hybrid cloud infrastructure, platforms, and services — with our partners.” The Economist recently stated relevant to the Cisco strategy, “On June 20th the firm announced a collection of new products which show how it is adapting: Cisco will focus on software and services, particularly the sort that automate the management of data networks.”\n\nTakeaway: Not actually sure on the current cloud strategy with Cisco as they are focused on network software and services and integration of AppDynamics and Viptela.\n\nVMware:\n\nIn April 2017, VMware announced the sale of their public cloud service vCloud Air to French cloud provider OVH. After their initial beta service in 2012, and the sale to Dell in 2016, VMware foreshadowed a move away from public cloud at the last VMworld. In October of 2016, VMware announced the VMware Cloud Foundation partnership with AWS. The Cloud Foundation also includes IBM, signaling the future direction of the company related to their cloud service offerings. vCloud Air was a network of 4,400 service providers originally started under the name vCloud Hybrid Service. As the service did not gain mass appeal and market share, EMC also widened their cloud bets on by acquiring Virtustream in 2015. Interestingly, Virtustream and VMware finally announced May 2017 better integration with the Enterprise Cloud Connector for VMware vRealize Automation. VMware customers can now extend applications and workloads to Virtustream’s Enterprise Cloud.\n\nTakeaway: With the exit of public cloud service and the pivot to partnerships with IBM and AWS, VMware says their focus is hybrid cloud, network virtualization, and multi-cloud enablement. I am sure AWS or IBM would love to acquire VMware in order to capture the migration of enterprise services to their infrastructure over time. The biggest future competitor to the VMware and AWS hybrid cloud partnership is Microsoft’s Azure Stack where Azure is enabling the public cloud experience behind the enterprise firewall.\n\nIntel:\n\nIn April 2017, Intel indicated that it cut funding for OpenStack projects with Rackspace. OpenStack was developed as a alternative to VMware to allow enterprise customers flexibility and their data centers costs. Intel and Rackspace ran the OpenStack Innovation Center since July 2015 and now Intel has exited the center. Employees at the Innovation Center were recently laid off. While OpenStack is still evolving, Intel’s participation and support is waning.\n\nTakeaway: Moving away from OpenStack, Intel announced November 2016 they are partnering with Google related to open-source container system Kubernetes as well as Google’s machine learning product TensorFlow to integrate with Intel’s architecture. This is part of Intel’s IoT hardware and cloud strategy.\n\nOracle:\n\nAnd lastly, when you think of cloud wars and attacks between competitors, Oracle is first on the list. Oracle’s stronghold on database customers is slowly being eroded by AWS, Microsoft, and SAP. Oracle, not going down easy, is fighting back with big rhetoric, acquisitions, and investments to counter the growing marketshare by the other providers. A late entrant in the cloud space, Oracle also announced recently the Cloud Machine product, touted to deliver public cloud service to enterprise data centers. Oracle will also install and manage their own gear in your data center with the Oracle Cloud at Customer Suite.\n\nTakeaway: You can expect more announcements at Oracle Openworld October 1–5, 2017 San Francisco https://www.oracle.com/openworld/. Linked from Oracle’s website, you read up on Larry Ellison’s 10-Point Plan: How Oracle Will Beat Amazon In The Cloud.\n\n=========\n\nUpdates since publication: ServerCentral has completed a strategic investment in Turing Group, a privately held company focused on the architecture, development, transformation, migration and management of applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n=========\n\nDouglas Pollei is currently an Advisor and Principle Analyst with responsibilities for research and technology related advisory services to enterprise and service providers.
