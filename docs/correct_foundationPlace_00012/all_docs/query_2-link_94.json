L.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nObservational results of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields are reviewed, including the fields in supernova remnants and loops, interstellar filaments and clouds, Hii regions and bubbles, the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web. A variety of approaches are used to investigate these fields. The orientations of magnetic fields in interstellar filaments and molecular clouds are traced by polarized thermal dust emission and starlight polarization. The field strengths and directions along the line of sight in dense clouds and cores are measured by Zeeman splitting of emission or absorption lines. The large-scale magnetic fields in the Milky Way have been best probed by Faraday rotation measures of a large number of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources. The coherent Galactic magnetic fields are found to follow the spiral arms and have their direction reversals in arms and interarm regions in the disk. The azimuthal fields in the halo reverse their directions below and above the Galactic plane. The orientations of organized magnetic fields in nearby galaxies have been observed through polarized synchrotron emission. Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium have been indicated by diffuse radio halos, polarized radio relics, and Faraday rotations of embedded radio galaxies and background sources. Sparse evidence for very weak magnetic fields in the cosmic web is the detection of the faint radio bridge between the Coma cluster and A1367. Future observations should aim at the 3D tomography of the large-scale coherent magnetic fields in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, a better description of intracluster field properties, and firm detections of intergalactic magnetic fields in the cosmic web.\n\nLOCAL INTERSTELLAR MAGNETIC FIELD DETERMINED FROM THE INTERSTELLAR BOUNDARY EXPLORER RIBBON\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZirnstein, E.

Invisible magnetic fields thread the Galaxy on all scales and play a vital but still poorly understood role in regulating flows of gas in the interstellar medium and the formation of stars. I will present highlights from my thesis work on magnetic fields in the diffuse interstellar gas and in accretion disks. At high Galactic latitudes, diffuse neutral hydrogen is organized into an intricate network of slender linear features. I will show that these neutral hydrogen âfibersâ are extremely well aligned with the ambient magnetic field as traced by both starlight polarization (Clark et al. 2014) and Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission (Clark et al. 2015). The structure of the neutral interstellar medium is more tightly coupled to the magnetic field than previously known. Because the orientation of neutral hydrogen is an independent predictor of the local dust polarization angle, our work provides a new tool in the search for inflationary gravitational wave B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background, which is currently limited by dust foreground contamination. Magnetic fields also drive accretion in astrophysical disks via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). I analytically derive the behavior of this instability in the weakly nonlinear regime and show that the saturated state of the instability depends on the geometry of the background magnetic field. The analytical model describes the behavior of the MRI in a Taylor-Couette flow, a set-up used by experimentalists in the ongoing quest to observe MRI in the laboratory (Clark & Oishi 2016a, 2016b).\n\nDeflection of the Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen Flow Across the Heliospheric Interface: an Interstellar Magnetic Compass\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLallement, R.; Eric, Q.; Jean-Loup, B.; Dimitra, K.; Risto, P.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nAnalyses of SOHO-SWAN observations show that the interstellar neutral H flow direction differs by about 4 degrees from the neutral He flow direction recently derived with an unprecedented accuracy using combined data sets (Mobius et al, 2004). The most likely explanation is a distortion of the heliospheric interface under the action of an inclined interstellar magnetic field, with imprints of the distorsion on the neutral H flow due to charge-transfer reactions between H atoms and ions. The direction of the ambient interstellar magnetic field and the heliospheric shape can be derived from the observed deviation. Implications for Voyager trajectories are discussed.\n\nMagnetized Neutron Stars in the Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nToropina, O. D.; Romanova, M. M.; Lovelace, R. V. E.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWe investigate the propagation of magnetized, isolated old neutron stars through the interstellar medium. We performed axisymmetric, non-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supersonic motion of neutron star with dipole magnetic field aligned with its velocity through the interstellar medium (ISM). We consider two cases: (1) where the accretion radius is larger than AlfvÃ©n radius, i.e. Racc>>RA and gravitational focusing is important; and (2) where Racc<magnetized star interacts with the ISM as a âgeorotatorâ, without significant gravitational focusing. In the first case we observe Bondi-Hoyle accretion onto an isolated magnetized neutron star. In the second case magnetic field lines are stretched downwind from the star and form a hollow elongated magnetotail. Reconnection of the magnetic field is observed in the tail which may lead to acceleration of particles.\n\nIMAGINE: Interstellar MAGnetic field INference Engine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteininger, Theo\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIMAGINE (Interstellar MAGnetic field INference Engine) performs inference on generic parametric models of the Galaxy. The modular open source framework uses highly optimized tools and technology such as the MultiNest sampler (ascl:1109.006) and the information field theory framework NIFTy (ascl:1302.013) to create an instance of the Milky Way based on a set of parameters for physical observables, using Bayesian statistics to judge the mismatch between measured data and model prediction. The flexibility of the IMAGINE framework allows for simple refitting for newly available data sets and makes state-of-the-art Bayesian methods easily accessible particularly for random components of the Galactic magnetic field.\n\nParamagnetic alignment of small grains: A novel method for measuring interstellar magnetic fields\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHoang, Thiem; Martin, P. G.; Lazarian, A.\n\n2014-07-20\n\nWe present a novel method to measure the strength of interstellar magnetic fields using ultraviolet (UV) polarization of starlight that is in part produced by weakly aligned, small dust grains. We begin with calculating the degrees of the paramagnetic alignment of small (size a â¼ 0.01 Î¼m) and very small (a â¼ 0.001 Î¼m) grains in the interstellar magnetic field due to the Davis-Greenstein relaxation and resonance relaxation. To calculate the degrees of paramagnetic alignment, we use Langevin equations and take into account various interaction processes essential for the rotational dynamics of small grains. We find that the alignment ofmoreÂ Â» small grains is necessary to reproduce the observed polarization in the UV, although the polarization arising from these small grains is negligible at the optical and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Based on fitting theoretical models to observed extinction and polarization curves, we find that the best-fit model for the case with the peak wavelength of polarization Î»{sub max} < 0.55 Î¼m requires a higher degree of alignment of small grains than for the typical case with Î»{sub max} = 0.55 Î¼m. We interpret the correlation between the systematic increase of the UV polarization relative to maximum polarization (i.e., of p(6 Î¼m{sup â1})/p{sub max}) with Î»{sub max}{sup â1} for cases of low Î»{sub max} by appealing to the higher degree of alignment of small grains. We utilize the correlation of the paramagnetic alignment of small grains with the magnetic field strength B to suggest a new way to measure B using the observable parameters Î»{sub max} and p(6 Î¼m{sup â1})/p{sub max}.Â«Â less\n\nSolar and Interstellar Magnetic Fields Artist Concept\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2012-12-03\n\nThis artist concept shows the different expected directions of the magnetic fields in interstellar space black lines and the magnetic field emanating from our sun white lines as NASA Voyager 1 spacecraft travels northward out of the heliosphere.\n\nCharting the Interstellar Magnetic Field causing the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) Ribbon of Energetic Neutral Atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, P.

J.; Fu, C.-W.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) near the heliosphere is a fundamental component of the solar galactic environment that can only be studied using polarized starlight. The results of an ongoing survey of the linear polarizations of local stars are analyzed with the goal of linking the ISMF that shapes the heliosphere to the nearby field in interstellar space. We present new results on the direction of the magnetic field within 40 pc obtained from analyzing polarization data using a merit function that determines the field direction that provides the best fit to the polarization data. Multiple magnetic components are identified, including a dominant interstellar field, {B}{POL}, that is aligned with the direction â, b = 36.Â°2, 49.Â°0 (Â±16.Â°0). Stars tracing {B}{POL} have the same mean distance as stars that do not trace {B}{POL}, but show weaker average polarizations consistent with a smaller column density of polarizing material. {B}{POL} is aligned with the ISMF traced by the IBEX Ribbon to within {7.6}-7.6+14.9 degrees. The variations in the polarization position angle directions derived from the data that best match {B}{POL} indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence, Ë9Â° Â± 1Â°. The direction of {B}{POL} is obtained after excluding polarization data tracing a separate magnetic structure that appears to be associated with interstellar dust deflected around the heliosphere. The velocities of local interstellar clouds relative to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) increase with the angles between the LSR velocities and {B}{POL}, indicating that the kinematics of local interstellar material is ordered by the ISMF. The Loop I superbubble that extends close to the Sun contains dust that reddens starlight and whose distance is determined by the color excess E(B - V) of starlight. Polarizations caused by grains aligned with respect to {B}{POL} are consistent with the location of the Sun in the rim of the Loop I superbubble.

The high-resolution, high-sensitivity, high-dynamic- range images show complex, tangled, extended filaments, and reveal that the fabric of the neutral interstellar medium is deeply tied to the structure of the ambient magnetic field. This discovery prompts an obvious question â how exactly is the interstellar {\\\\it neutral} hydrogen being affected by the galactic magnetic field? We look into this question by examining a set of GALFA-HI data in great detail. We have chosen a long, straight filament in the southern galactic sky. This structure is both close by and isolated in velocity space. Gaussian analysis of profiles both along and across the filament reveal internal structure â braided strands that can be traced through the simplest part, but become tangled in more complex segments. These braids do not resemble in any way the old spherical HI clouds and rudimentary pressure balance models that were used to explain the pre-GALFA- HI interstellar medium. It is clear that these structures are created, constrained, and dominated by magnetic fields. Like many subfields of astronomy before it, e.g., physics of the solar coronal, extragalactic radio jets, and pulsar environment, scientists are confronted with observations that simply cannot be explained by simple hydrodynamics and are forced to consider magneto-hydrodynamics.\n\nInteraction of the Local Interstellar Medium with the Heliosphere: Role of the Interior and Exterior Magnetic Fields\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarnes, Aaron; DeVincenzi, Donald (Technical Monitor)\n\n2000-01-01\n\nA complete model of the global interaction between the solar wind and the local interstellar medium must take account of interstellar neutral atoms, interstellar ionized gas, solar and galactic magnetic fields, galactic and anomalous cosmic rays. For now, however, in view of the many uncertainties about conditions in the interstellar medium, etc., all models must be regarded as highly idealized and incomplete. In the present review I concentrate on the role of magnetic fields of solar and interstellar origin. The former, the interior field, has negligible influence on the unshocked solar wind; the immediate post-shock solar wind is probably low-beta, so that the interior magnetic field is still unimportant, but this situation changes as the plasma flows through the heliosheath, and a ridge of strong magnetic field may form to separate materials of polar and equatorial origin. The exterior (interstellar) field is likely to play an important role in determining the global morphology of the system outside the termination shock. If the exterior field is strong enough, it can compress the heliosphere (although exterior neutral and/or ionized hydrogen may play the dominant role). Even if the interstellar magnetic field does not provide the dominant pressure, its orientation can substantially affect the configuration of the heliosphere, especially the location and orientation of the heliospheric discontinuities. The configurations can be quite different for the situations in which the field and flow are (a) aligned or (b) transverse. Obliquity of the field produces asymmetry in the geometry of the system; in particular the noses of heliopause and interstellar bow shock are shifted away from the interstellar flow direction, and in opposite directions, due to the asymmetric draping of the magnetic field.\n\nA Heliosphere Buffeted by Interstellar Turbulence?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJokipii, J. R.; Giacalone, J.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nRecent observations from IBEX combined with previous measurements from other sources suggest new, local, effects of interstellar turbulence. Observations of various interstellar parameters such as the magnetic field, fluid velocity and electron density, over large spatial scales, have revealed a broadband Kolmogorov spectrum of interstellar turbulence which pervades most of interstellar space. The outer scale (or coherence scale of this turbulence) is found to be approximately 10^19 cm and the inner cutoff scale is less than 1000 km. The root-mean-square relative fluctuation in the fluid and the magnetic-field parameters is of order unity. If this turbulence exists at the heliosphere, the root-mean-square relative fluctuations at 100 (heliospheric) AU scales is approximately 0.1. The recently published value for the change In observed velocity direction for the interstellar flow relative to the heliosphere (Frisch, etal, 2014)is consistent with this. Similarly, interpreting the width of the IBEX ribbon in terms of a fluctuating magnetic field also is in agreement with this picture. Observations of TeV cosmic rays can also be explained. Potential effects of these fluctuations in the interstellar medium on the heliosphere will be discussed.

J.; Meliani, Z.; Marcowith, A.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nContext. The winds of massive stars create large (>10 pc) bubbles around their progenitors. As these bubbles expand they encounter the interstellar coherent magnetic field which, depending on its strength, can influence the shape of the bubble. Aims: We wish to investigate if, and how much, the interstellar magnetic field can contribute to the shape of an expanding circumstellar bubble around a massive star. Methods: We use the MPI-AMRVAC code to make magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of bubbles, using a single star model, combined with several different field strengths: B = 5, 10, and 20 Î¼G for the interstellar magnetic field. This covers the typical field strengths of the interstellar magnetic fields found in the galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, we present two simulations that include both a 5 Î¼G interstellar magnetic field and a warm (10 000 K) interstellar medium (ISM) and two different ISM densities to demonstrate how the magnetic field can combine with other external factors to influence the morphology of the circumstellar bubbles. Results: Our results show that low magnetic fields, as found in the galactic disk, inhibit the growth of the circumstellar bubbles in the direction perpendicular to the field. As a result, the bubbles become ovoid, rather than spherical. Strong interstellar fields, such as observed for the galactic bulge, can completely stop the expansion of the bubble in the direction perpendicular to the field, leading to the formation of a tube-like bubble. When combined with an ISM that is both warm and high density the bubble is greatly reduced in size, causing a dramatic change in the evolution of temporary features inside the bubble such as Wolf-Rayet ring nebulae. Conclusions: The magnetic field of the interstellar medium can affect the shape of circumstellar bubbles. This effect may have consequences for the shape and evolution of circumstellar nebulae and supernova remnants, which are formed within the main wind-blown bubble\n\nEyes in the sky. Interactions between asymptotic giant branch star winds and the interstellar magnetic field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nvan Marle, A. J.; Cox, N. L. J.; Decin, L.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nContext. The extended circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of evolved low-mass stars display a large variety of morphologies. Understanding the various mechanisms that give rise to these extended structures is important to trace their mass-loss history. Aims: Here, we aim to examine the role of the interstellar magnetic field in shaping the extended morphologies of slow dusty winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in an effort to pin-point the origin of so-called eye shaped CSEs of three carbon-rich AGB stars. In addition, we seek to understand if this pre-planetary nebula (PN) shaping can be responsible for asymmetries observed in PNe. Methods: Hydrodynamical simulations are used to study the effect of typical interstellar magnetic fields on the free-expanding spherical stellar winds as they sweep up the local interstellar medium (ISM). Results: The simulations show that typical Galactic interstellar magnetic fields of 5 to 10 Î¼G are sufficient to alter the spherical expanding shells of AGB stars to appear as the characteristic eye shape revealed by far-infrared observations. The typical sizes of the simulated eyes are in accordance with the observed physical sizes. However, the eye shapes are transient in nature. Depending on the stellar and interstellar conditions, they develop after 20 000 to 200 000 yrs and last for about 50 000 to 500 000 yrs, assuming that the star is at rest relative to the local interstellar medium. Once formed, the eye shape develops lateral outflows parallel to the magnetic field. The explosion of a PN in the centre of the eye-shaped dust shell gives rise to an asymmetrical nebula with prominent inward pointing Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Conclusions: Interstellar magnetic fields can clearly affect the shaping of wind-ISM interaction shells. The occurrence of the eyes is most strongly influenced by stellar space motion and ISM density. Observability of this transient phase is favoured for lines-of-sight perpendicular to the\n\nTHE INTERSTELLAR MAGNETIC FIELD CLOSE TO THE SUN. II\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFrisch, P. C.; Andersson, B-G; Berdyugin, A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe magnetic field in the local interstellar medium (ISM) provides a key indicator of the galactic environment of the Sun and influences the shape of the heliosphere. We have studied the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) in the solar vicinity using polarized starlight for stars within 40 pc of the Sun and 90 Degree-Sign of the heliosphere nose. In Frisch et al. (Paper I), we developed a method for determining the local ISMF direction by finding the best match to a group of interstellar polarization position angles obtained toward nearby stars, based on the assumption that the polarization is parallel tomoreÂ Â» the ISMF. In this paper, we extend the analysis by utilizing weighted fits to the position angles and by including new observations acquired for this study. We find that the local ISMF is pointed toward the galactic coordinates l, b =47 Degree-Sign {+-} 20 Degree-Sign , 25 Degree-Sign {+-} 20 Degree-Sign . This direction is close to the direction of the ISMF that shapes the heliosphere, l, b =33 Degree-Sign {+-} 4 Degree-Sign , 55 Degree-Sign {+-} 4 Degree-Sign , as traced by the center of the 'Ribbon' of energetic neutral atoms discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission. Both the magnetic field direction and the kinematics of the local ISM are consistent with a scenario where the local ISM is a fragment of the Loop I superbubble. A nearby ordered component of the local ISMF has been identified in the region l Almost-Equal-To 0 Degree-Sign {yields} 80 Degree-Sign and b Almost-Equal-To 0 Degree-Sign {yields} 30 Degree-Sign , where PlanetPol data show a distance-dependent increase of polarization strength. The ordered component extends to within 8 pc of the Sun and implies a weak curvature in the nearby ISMF of {approx}0.{sup 0}25 pc{sup -1}. This conclusion is conditioned on the small sample of stars available for defining this rotation. Variations from the ordered component suggest a turbulent component of {approx}23 Degree-Sign .

Exact expressions and suitable approximations for the density and the flow velocity are derived and discussed. In addition to the stationary induction equation, these expressions also satisfy the momentum balance equation along stream lines. The practical usefulness of the corresponding, still exact, analytical magnetic field solution is assessed by comparing it quantitatively to results from a fully self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulationmoreÂ Â» of the interstellar magnetic field draping around the heliopause.Â«Â less\n\nTentative Identification of Interstellar Dust in the Magnetic Wall of the Heliosphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, P. C.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nData showing that light from nearby stars, <40 pc, is weakly polarized are consistent with the capture and alignment of dust grains in the magnetic wall of the heliosphere. These data, from Tinbergen (1982) and Piirola (1977), were acquired during the solar minimum of the mid-1970's when the magnetic wall was expected to form at negative ecliptic latitudes because the solar magnetic polarity was north-pole-positive. The polarization is seen primarily at negative ecliptic latitudes, consistent with the expected magnetic wall position. The interstellar magnetic field direction at the Sun is derived from these data. The small dust grains most likely to cause the polarization are also the grains excluded from the heliosphere by small gyroradii, <100 AU. The direction of maximum polarization is offset by Ë 20 --40 deg. from the inflow direction of the large grains that are gravitationally focused in the heliosphere tail. Interstellar dust grains in and near the heliosphere form a potential contaminant of the cosmic microwave background signal, which should then be identifiable because the spatial behavior of these grains depends on the phase of the 22 year solar magnetic activity cycle. The author would like to thank NASA for supporting her research.\n\nTentative Identification of Interstellar Dust in the Magnetic Wall of the Heliosphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, Priscilla C.\n\n2005-10-01\n\nObservations of the weak polarization of light from nearby stars, reported by Tinbergen, are consistent with polarization by small (radius <0.14 Î¼m), interstellar dust grains entrained in the magnetic wall of the heliosphere. The region of maximum polarization is toward ecliptic coordinates (Î», Î²)~(295deg, 0deg), corresponding to (l, b) = (20Â°, -21Â°). The direction of maximum polarization is offset along the ecliptic longitude by ~35Â° from the nose of the heliosphere and extends to low ecliptic latitudes. An offset is also seen between the region with the best-aligned dust grains, Î»~281deg-330deg, and the upwind direction of the undeflected large grains, Î»~259deg, Î²~+8deg, which are observed by Ulysses and Galileo to be flowing into the heliosphere. In the aligned-grain region, the strength of polarization anticorrelates with ecliptic latitude, indicating that the magnetic wall is predominantly at negative ecliptic latitudes. An extension of the magnetic wall to Î²<0deg, formed by the interstellar magnetic field BIS draped over the heliosphere, is consistent with predictions by Linde (1998). A consistent interpretation follows if the maximum-polarization region traces the heliosphere magnetic wall in a direction approximately perpendicular to BIS, while the region of best-aligned dust samples the region where BIS drapes smoothly over the heliosphere with maximum compression. These data are consistent with BIS being tilted by 60Â° with respect to the ecliptic plane and parallel to the Galactic plane. Interstellar dust grains captured in the heliosheath may also introduce a weak, but important, large-scale contaminant for the cosmic microwave background signal with a symmetry consistent with the relative tilts of BIS and the ecliptic.\n\nENERGETIC NEUTRAL HYDROGEN OBSERVATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT VOYAGER 1 IS NOT OBSERVING THE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG INTERSTELLAR MAGNETIC FIELD\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGloeckler, G.; Fisk, L. A., E-mail: gglo@umich.edu\n\nIt is generally believed that Voyager 1 ( V1 ) is now in interstellar space, having crossed the heliopause at a heliocentric distance of 121.58 au in late August of 2012. Here we use recently published spectra of energetic neutral hydrogen, and the magnetic field and energetic particles directly measured by V1 to find the average pressure in the inner heliosheath (termination shock to 122 au). This pressure turns out to be surprisingly large, (3.57Â Â±Â 0.71)Â ÃÂ 10{sup â12} dyn cm{sup â2}, and is completely dominated by pressures of pickup ions (PUIs), created in the inner heliosheath, and their suprathermal tails (43%), andmoreÂ Â» PUIs and their tails that are produced upstream of the termination shock and enter the heliosheath (46%). We compute the total particle pressure in the outer heliosheath near the heliopause from distribution functions of the interstellar plasma and locally created PUIs using profiles of proton density, proton temperature, and neutral hydrogen density from model 2 in Zank et al., and find it to be at most 7.7Â ÃÂ 10{sup â13} dyn cm{sup â2}. Balancing pressure across the heliopause, thus requires an unusually large magnetic pressure (2.8Â ÃÂ 10{sup â12} dyn cm{sup â2}). The resulting strength and 1 Ï uncertainty of the draped magnetic field in the outer heliosheath near the heliopause is 0.839Â Â±Â 0.106 nT. The 3 Ï lower limit field strength (0.52 nT) is greater than the field of â¼0.43Â Â±Â 0.02 nT measured by V1 , implying that there is less than 1% probability that V1 is measuring the interstellar draped field.Â«Â less\n\nInterstellar Dust in the Heliosheath: Tentative Discovery of the Magnetic Wall of the Heliosphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, P. C.\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe evident identification of interstellar dust grains entrained in the magnetic wall of the heliosphere is reported. It is shown that the distribution of dust grains causing the weak polarization of light from nearby stars is consistent with polarization by small charged interstellar dust grains captured in the heliosphere magnetic wall (Tinbergen 1982, Frisch 2005). There is an offset between the deflected small charged polarizing dust grains, radius less than 0.2 microns, and the undeflected large grain population, radius larger than 0.2 microns. The region of maximum polarization is towards ecliptic coordinates lambda,beta = 295,0 deg, which is offset along the ecliptic longitude by about 35 deg from the heliosphere nose and extends to low ecliptic latitudes where the heliosphere magnetic wall is expected. An offset is also found between the best aligned dust grains, near lambda=281 deg to 220 deg, and the upwind direction of the undeflected inflow of large grains seen by Ulysses and Galileo. In the aligned-grain region, the polarization strength anti-correlates with ecliptic latitude, indicating that the magnetic wall was predominantly at negative ecliptic latitudes when these data were acquired. These data are consistent with model predictions for an interstellar magnetic field which is tilted by 60 deg with respect to the ecliptic plane, and parallel to the galactic plane.

However, there is no universal diagnostic for the magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) and each magnetic tracer has its limitation. Any new detection method is thus valuable. Theoretical studies have shown that submillimetre fine-structure lines are polarized due to atomic alignment by ultraviolet photon-excitation, which opens up a new avenue to probe interstellar magnetic fields. We will, for the first time, perform synthetic observations on the simulated three-dimensional ISM to demonstrate the measurability of the polarization of submillimetre atomic lines. The maximum polarization for different absorption and emission lines expected from various sources, including star-forming regions are provided. Our results demonstrate that the polarization of submillimetre atomic lines is a powerful magnetic tracer and add great value to the observational studies of the submilimetre astronomy.\n\nMagnetic Field Fluctuations Observed in the Heliosheath and Interstellar Magnetic Field by Voyager 1 at 115.7-124.9 AU during 2011-2013\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurlaga, L. F.; Ness, N. F.; Florinski, V.; Heerikhuisen, J.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWe discuss microscale fluctuations of the hour averages of the magnetic field B observed on a scale of one day by Voyager 1 (V1) from 2011.0 to 2012.3143 (when it was within the distant heliosheath, where the average magnetic field strength langBrang = 0.17 nT) and during the interval from 2012.6503 to 2013.5855 (when it was within the interstellar plasma with langBrang = 0.47 nT). In both regions, the fluctuations were primarily compressive fluctuations, varying along the average B (âT direction in RTN coordinates). In the heliosheath, the average of the daily standard deviations (SDs) of the compressive and transverse components of B were langSDcrang = 0.010 nT and langSDtrang <= 0.005 nT (which is the limit of the measurement). In the distant heliosheath langSDcrang/langBrang = 0.06, and the distributions of SD were skewed and highly kurtotic. The interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) strength was B = 0.48 nT, but the fluctuations were below the limit of measurement: langSDcrang = 0.004 nT and langabs(SDt)rang = 0.004 nT. The distributions of these interstellar SDs have skewness and kurtosis consistent with a Gaussian noise distribution. We also discuss the fluctuations of 48 s averages of B on a scale of 1 day during a 30 day interval when V1 was observing the ISMF. For the fluctuations in all three components of B, SD = 0.010 nT, which gives an upper limit on the fluctuations of the ISMF on the scales observed by V1. This SD rules out the possibility that there is significant power in electromagnetic fluctuations generated by pickup ion ring instabilities at these scales, which strongly constrains models of the IBEX ribbon.\n\nProspects for Studying Interstellar Magnetic Fields with a Far-Infrared Polarimeter for SAFIR\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDowell, C. Darren; Chuss, D. T.; Dotson, J. L.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPolarimetry at mid-infrared through millimeter wavelengths using airborne and ground-based telescopes has revealed magnetic structures in dense molecular clouds in the interstellar medium, primarily in regions of star formation. Furthermore, spectropolarimetry has offered clues about the composition of the dust grains and the mechanism by which they are aligned with respect to the local magnetic field. The sensitivity of the observations to date has been limited by the emission from the atmosphere and warm telescopes. A factor of 1000 in sensitivity can be gained by using instead a cold space telescope. With 5 arcminute resolution, Planck will make the first submillimeter polarization survey of the full Galaxy early in the next decade. We discuss the science case for and basic design of a far-infrared polarimeter on the SAFIR space telescope, which offers resolution in the few arcsecond range and wavelength selection of cold and warm dust components. Key science themes include the formation and evolution of molecular clouds in nearby spiral galaxies, the magnetic structure of the Galactic center, and interstellar turbulence.\n\nMagnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTritsis, Aris; Tassis, Konstantinos\n\n2018-05-01\n\nStars and planets are formed inside dense interstellar molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds. Determining the 3D structure of interstellar clouds remains challenging because of projection effects and difficulties measuring the extent of the clouds along the line of sight. We report the detection of normal vibrational modes in the isolated interstellar cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D physical dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.\n\nInvestigating Systematic Errors of the Interstellar Flow Longitude Derived from the Pickup Ion Cutoff\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaut, A.; Berger, L.; Drews, C.; Bower, J.; Keilbach, D.; Lee, M. A.; Moebius, E.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nComplementary to the direct neutral particle measurements performed by e.g. IBEX, the measurement of PickUp Ions (PUIs) constitutes a diagnostic tool to investigate the local interstellar medium. PUIs are former neutral particles that have been ionized in the inner heliosphere. Subsequently, they are picked up by the solar wind and its frozen-in magnetic field. Due to this process, a characteristic Velocity Distribution Function (VDF) with a sharp cutoff evolves, which carries information about the PUI's injection speed and thus the former neutral particle velocity. The symmetry of the injection speed about the interstellar flow vector is used to derive the interstellar flow longitude from PUI measurements. Using He PUI data obtained by the PLASTIC sensor on STEREO A, we investigate how this concept may be affected by systematic errors. The PUI VDF strongly depends on the orientation of the local interplanetary magnetic field. Recently injected PUIs with speeds just below the cutoff speed typically form a highly anisotropic torus distribution in velocity space, which leads to a longitudinal transport for certain magnetic field orientation. Therefore, we investigate how the selection of magnetic field configurations in the data affects the result for the interstellar flow longitude that we derive from the PUI cutoff. Indeed, we find that the results follow a systematic trend with the filtered magnetic field angles that can lead to a shift of the result up to 5Â°. In turn, this means that every value for the interstellar flow longitude derived from the PUI cutoff is affected by a systematic error depending on the utilized magnetic field orientations. Here, we present our observations, discuss possible reasons for the systematic trend we discovered, and indicate selections that may minimize the systematic errors.\n\nCosmic Ray Proton Anisotropies Measured at Voyager 1 in the Local Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDecker, R. B.; Krimigis, S. M.; Hill, M. E.; Roelof, E. C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nVoyager 1 entered the local interstellar medium in August of 2012 at helioradius 121.6 AU and heliolatitude N35Â°, and is now about 15 AU (â12% the sun-heliopause distance at Voyager 1) upstream of the heliopause nose. Intensities of low-energy ions and electrons and of anomalous cosmic rays, all of which were routinely measured in the heliosheath, remain at background levels through July 2016. Galactic cosmic ray protons >211 MeV continue to show departures from isotropy, with broad (0.3-0.8 year) episodes of steady intensity depletions of ions gyrating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field. Percentage intensity decreases during these depletions, relative to intensities of cosmic rays propagating along the field, peak at -7% on 2013.35, -3% on 2014.50, and -10% on 2016.00. In the last case, the peak anisotropy was preceded by an intensity decline lasting at least 9 months. The 2016.00 peak (-10%) anisotropy of was followed by a recovery back toward isotropy. But this recovery was interrupted in mid-April 2016, when the anisotropy had reached -2%, at which time the anisotropy began to again increase and continued to do so through at least July 2016, when the anisotropy reached -3%. We note that during its 4-year propagation through the local interstellar medium, Voyager 1 has encountered mainly anisotropic cosmic ray distributions. The longest period of isotropy occurred during a 4-month period in the latter half of 2014. Gurnett et al. [Ap. J., 809, 2015; Fall 2016 AGU (this meeting)] suggested that the broad periods when cosmic ray intensities evolve away from isotropy are precursor signatures produced by weak magnetic disturbances driven by solar activity. These disturbances propagate through the interstellar medium where they produce the bursts of electron plasma oscillations and peak cosmic ray anisotropies that are measured at Voyager 1 just before the disturbances cross the spacecraft.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURE FUNCTION OF ROTATION MEASURE IN THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nXu, Siyao; Zhang, Bing, E-mail: syxu@pku.edu.cn, E-mail: zhang@physics.unlv.edu\n\n2016-06-20\n\nThe observed structure function (SF) of rotation measure (RM) varies as a broken power-law function of angular scales. The systematic shallowness of its spectral slope is inconsistent with the standard Kolmogorov scaling. This motivates us to examine the statistical analysis on RM fluctuations. The correlations of RM constructed by Lazarian and Pogosyan are demonstrated to be adequate in explaining the observed features of RM SFs through a direct comparison between the theoretically obtained and observationally measured SF results. By segregating the density and magnetic field fluctuations and adopting arbitrary indices for their respective power spectra, we find that when themoreÂ Â» SFs of RM and emission measure have a similar form over the same range of angular scales, the statistics of the RM fluctuations reflect the properties of density fluctuations. RM SFs can be used to evaluate the mean magnetic field along the line of sight, but cannot serve as an informative source on the properties of turbulent magnetic field in the interstellar medium. We identify the spectral break of RM SFs as the inner scale of a shallow spectrum of electron density fluctuations, which characterizes the typical size of discrete electron density structures in the observed region.Â«Â less\n\nMagnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension.\n\nPubMed\n\nTritsis, Aris; Tassis, Konstantinos\n\n2018-05-11\n\nStars and planets are formed inside dense interstellar molecular clouds by processes imprinted on the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the clouds.

Voyager 1 has been measuring interstellar plasma properties outside the heliosphere, including the galactic cosmic ray flux, (indirectly) the compressed interstellar plasma, as well as the compressed interstellar magnetic field draped around the heliosphere. Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) neutral atom observations complement the only in situ observations of the VLISM made by Voyager 1. IBEX is an Earth-orbiting spacecraft equipped with two single-pixel cameras that detect neutral atoms produced by the interaction of the solar wind (SW) with the VLISM, as well as neutral atoms flowing into the heliosphere from the VLISM itself. After its launch in 2009, IBEX discovered the unexpected existence of the \"ribbon,\" a nearly circular arc across the sky of enhanced hydrogen ENA fluxes observed at keV energies. The ribbon fluxes originate from look directions perpendicular to the local interstellar magnetic field draped around the heliosphere, and can be used to derive the VLISM magnetic field magnitude and direction far from the heliopause. Thus, IBEX observations of the ribbon complement Voyager 1 in situ observations of the VLISM magnetic field, and provide insight into what Voyager 2 will observe after it crosses the heliopause. This talk will review key IBEX observations of the VLISM environment related to the ribbon and the VLISM magnetic field observed by Voyager 1, and their implications for the VLISM environment.\n\nThe Origin of Compressible Magnetic Turbulence in the Very Local Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZank, G. P.; Du, S.; Hunana, P.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nVoyager 1 observed compressible magnetic turbulence in the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). We show that inner heliosheath (IHS) fast- and slow-mode waves incident on the heliopause (HP) generate VLISM fast-mode waves only that propagate into the VLISM. We suggest that this is the origin of compressible turbulence in the VLISM. We show that fast- and slow-mode waves transmitted across a tangential discontinuity such as the HP are strongly refracted on crossing the HP and subsequently propagate at highly oblique angles to the VLISM magnetic field. Thus, fast-mode waves in the VLISM contribute primarily to the compressible and not the transverse components of the VLISM fluctuating magnetic field variance < Î´ {\\\\hat{B}}2> since < Î´ {\\\\hat{B}}{fz}2> \\\n\nOptical Polarization as a Probe of the Local Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTinbergen, J.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe use of interstellar polarization as a tool for measuring interstellar dust is discussed. Problems resulting from dust and magnetic field configurations becoming mixed up are discussed, as is the availability of sufficiently bright stars to obtain the photons needed for precision measurements. It is proposed that: (1) on the scale of several hundred parsec, there is a preferential magnetic field direction, as evidenced by observations at the Galactic poles and selected longitudes in the Galactic plane; (2) the local (r 50 pc) region is devoid of dust, as evidenced by the mean square degree of polarization as a function of distance; and, less certainly, that (3) at a distance of less than 5 pc, there is a patch of dust which may be of interest in connection with cloud models.\n\nProperties of nearby interstellar hydrogen deduced from Lyman-alpha sky background measurements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThomas, G. E.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nFor a sufficiently rapid relative motion of the solar system and the nearby interstellar gas, neutral atoms may be expected to penetrate the heliosphere before becoming ionized. Recent satellite measurements of the Lyman alpha emission above the geocorona indicate such an interstellar wind of neutral hydrogen emerging from the direction of Sagittarius and reaching to within a few astronomical units of the sun. A detailed model of the scattering of solar Lyman alpha from the spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen in interplanetary space is presented. This asymmetric distribution is established by solar wind and solar ultraviolet ionization processes along the trajectories of the incoming hydrogen atoms. The values of the interstellar density, the relative velocity, and the gas temperature are adjusted to agree with the Lyman alpha measurements. The results may be interpreted in terms of two models, the cold model and the hot model of the interstellar gas, depending on whether galactic Lyman alpha emission is present at its maximum allowable value or negligibly small.\n\nIS VOYAGER 1 INSIDE AN INTERSTELLAR FLUX TRANSFER EVENT?\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchwadron, N.

J., E-mail: n.schwadron@unh.edu\n\nPlasma wave observations from VoyagerÂ 1 have recently shown large increases in plasma density, to about 0.1Â cm{sup â3}, consistent with the density of the local interstellar medium. However, corresponding magnetic field observations continue to show the spiral magnetic field direction observed throughout the inner heliosheath. These apparently contradictory observations may be reconciled if VoyagerÂ 1 is inside an interstellar flux transfer eventâsimilar to flux transfer events routinely seen at the Earth's magnetopause. If this were the case, VoyagerÂ 1 remains inside the heliopause and based on the VoyagerÂ 1 observations we can determine the polarity of the interstellar magnetic field for the first time.\n\nPlanck intermediate results: XXXII.

The Planck all-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353 GHz provide the required combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation between the structures of the Galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter over the whole sky, both in the diffuse ISM and in molecular clouds. The data reveal that structures, or ridges, in the intensity map have counterparts in themoreÂ Â» Stokes Q and/or U maps. In this paper, we focus our study on structures at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes, which cover two orders of magnitude in column density, from 10 20 to 10 22 cm -2. We measure the magnetic field orientation on the plane ofthe sky from the polarization data, and present an algorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensity map. We use analytical models to account for projection effects. Comparing polarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratio between the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magnetic field to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. We find that the ridges are usually aligned with the magnetic field measured on the structures. This statistical trend becomes more striking for increasing polarization fraction and decreasing column density. There is no alignment for the highest column density ridges. We interpret the increase in alignment with polarization fraction as a consequence of projection effects. We present maps to show that the decrease in alignment for high column density is not due to a loss of correlation between the distribution of matter and the geometry of the magnetic field.

We investigate four strengths of the LISM magnetic field, from 1 to 4 Î¼G, and adjust the LISM proton and hydrogen densities so that the distance to the termination shock (TS) in the directions of the Voyager spacecraft is just below 90 AU, and the density of hydrogen at the TS is close to 0.09 cm-3 in the nose direction. The orientationmoreÂ Â» of the magnetic field is chosen to point toward the center of the ribbon of enhanced energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux seen in the IBEX data. Our simulations show that the plasma and neutral properties in the outer heliosheath vary considerably as a function of the LISM magnetic field strength. We also show that the heliotail points downwind in all cases, though its structure is strongly affected by the external magnetic field. Lastly, comparison and consistency between the simulated ENA flux and the circularity of the ribbon as measured by IBEX are most consistent with a LISM magnetic field strength aligned with the center of the ribbon and a magnitude in the range 2.5-3 Î¼G.Â«Â less\n\nStardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination VII: Synchrotron X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis of Six Stardust Interstellar Candidates Measured with the Advanced Photon Source 2-ID-D Microprobe\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAllen, Carlton C.; Anderson, David; Bastien, Ron K.; Brenker, Frank E.; Flynn, George J.; Frank, David; Gainsforth, Zack; Sandford, Scott A.; Simionovici, Alexandre S.; Zolensky, Michael E.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe NASA Stardust spacecraft exposed an aerogel collector to the interstellar dust passing through the solar system. We performed X-ray fluorescence element mapping and abundance measurements, for elements 19 < or = Z < or = 30, on six \"interstellar candidates,\" potential interstellar impacts identified by Stardust@Home and extracted for analyses in picokeystones. One, I1044,3,33, showed no element hot-spots within the designated search area. However, we identified a nearby surface feature, consistent with the impact of a weak, high-speed particle having an approximately chondritic (CI) element abundance pattern, except for factor-of-ten enrichments in K and Zn and an S depletion. This hot-spot, containing approximately 10 fg of Fe, corresponds to an approximately 350 nm chondritic particle, small enough to be missed by Stardust@Home, indicating that other techniques may be necessary to identify all interstellar candidates. Only one interstellar candidate, I1004,1,2, showed a track. The terminal particle has large enrichments in S, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn relative to Fe-normalized CI values. It has high Al/Fe, but does not match the Ni/Fe range measured for samples of Al-deck material from the Stardust sample return capsule, which was within the field-of-view of the interstellar collector. A third interstellar candidate, I1075,1,25, showed an Al-rich surface feature that has a composition generally consistent with the Al-deck material, suggesting that it is a secondary particle. The other three interstellar candidates, I1001,1,16, I1001,2,17, and I1044,2,32, showed no impact features or tracks, but allowed assessment of submicron contamination in this aerogel, including Fe hot-spots having CI-like Ni/Fe ratios, complicating the search for CI-like interstellar/interplanetary dust.\n\nStardust Interstellar Preliminary Examination VII: Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence analysis of six Stardust interstellar candidates measured with the Advanced Photon Source 2-ID-D microprobe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFlynn, George J.; Sutton, Steven R.; Lai, Barry; Wirick, Sue; Allen, Carlton; Anderson, David; Ansari, Asna; Bajt, SaÅ¡A.; Bastien, Ron K.; Bassim, Nabil; Bechtel, Hans A.; Borg, Janet; Brenker, Frank E.; Bridges, John; Brownlee, Donald E.; Burchell, Mark; Burghammer, Manfred; Butterworth, Anna L.; Changela, Hitesh; Cloetens, Peter; Davis, Andrew M.; Doll, Ryan; Floss, Christine; Frank, David; Gainsforth, Zack; GrÃ¼n, Eberhard; Heck, Philipp R.; Hillier, Jon K.; Hoppe, Peter; Hudson, Bruce; Huth, Joachim; Hvide, Brit; Kearsley, Anton; King, Ashley J.; Leitner, Jan; Lemelle, Laurence; Leroux, Hugues; Leonard, Ariel; Lettieri, Robert; Marchant, William; Nittler, Larry R.; Ogliore, Ryan; Ong, Wei Ja; Postberg, Frank; Price, Mark C.; Sandford, Scott A.; Tresseras, Juan-Angel Sans; Schmitz, Sylvia; Schoonjans, Tom; Silversmit, Geert; Simionovici, Alexandre; Sol, Vicente A.; Srama, Ralf; Stadermann, Frank J.; Stephan, Thomas; Sterken, Veerle; Stodolna, Julien; Stroud, Rhonda M.; Trieloff, Mario; Tsou, Peter; Tsuchiyama, Akira; Tyliszczak, Tolek; Vekemans, Bart; Vincze, Laszlo; von Korff, Joshua; Westphal, Andrew J.; Wordsworth, Naomi; Zevin, Daniel; Zolensky, Michael E.\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe NASA Stardust spacecraft exposed an aerogel collector to the interstellar dust passing through the solar system.

V. The Bow Wave, Heliospheric Boundary Layer, Instabilities, and Magnetic Reconnection\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPogorelov, N. V.; Heerikhuisen, J.; Roytershteyn, V.\n\nThe heliosphere is formed due to interaction between the solar wind (SW) and local interstellar medium (LISM). The shape and position of the heliospheric boundary, the heliopause, in space depend on the parameters of interacting plasma flows. The interplay between the asymmetrizing effect of the interstellar magnetic field and charge exchange between ions and neutral atoms plays an important role in the SWâLISM interaction. By performing three-dimensional, MHD plasma/kinetic neutral atom simulations, we determine the width of the outer heliosheathâthe LISM plasma region affected by the presence of the heliosphereâand analyze quantitatively the distributions in front of the heliopause. ItmoreÂ Â» is shown that charge exchange modifies the LISM plasma to such extent that the contribution of a shock transition to the total variation of plasma parameters becomes small even if the LISM velocity exceeds the fast magnetosonic speed in the unperturbed medium. By performing adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we show that a distinct boundary layer of decreased plasma density and enhanced magnetic field should be observed on the interstellar side of the heliopause. We show that this behavior is in agreement with the plasma oscillations of increasing frequency observed by the plasma wave instrument onboard Voyager 1. We also demonstrate that Voyager observations in the inner heliosheath between the heliospheric termination shock and the heliopause are consistent with dissipation of the heliospheric magnetic field. The choice of LISM parameters in this analysis is based on the simulations that fit observations of energetic neutral atoms performed by Interstellar Boundary Explorer .Â«Â less\n\nEditorial: Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX): Direct Sampling of the Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcComas, D. J.\n\n2012-02-01\n\nabsorption (Redfield & Linsky 2008). Bzowski et al. also show evidence for a previously unknown and unanticipated secondary population of helium. Together, the MÃ¶bius et al. (2012) and Bzowski et al. (2012) results provide a new interstellar flow direction and a significantly lower velocity of the incoming gas and therefore significantly lower dynamic pressure on the heliosphere, which translates into a heliospheric interaction that is even less dominated by the external dynamic pressure and clearly lies squarely in the middle ground of astrospheres dominated by the external magnetic and dynamic pressures (McComas et al. 2009b). On another topic, Bochsler et al. (2012) report the first direct measurements of interstellar Ne and estimate the interstellar Ne/O abundance ratio, showing a gas-phase Ne/O ratio for the LISM of 0.27 Â± 0.10. This value agrees with results obtained from pickup ion observations (Gloeckler & Geiss 2004; Gloeckler & Fisk 2007) and is significantly larger than the solar abundance ratio, indicating that the LISM is different than the Sun's formation region and/or that a substantial portion of the O in the LISM is tied up (and thus \"hidden\") in grains and/or ices. Finally, Saul et al. (2012) provide the first detailed analysis of the new interstellar H measurements from IBEX. These authors confirm that the arrival direction of interstellar H is offset from that of He. They further show a variation in the strength of the radiation pressure and thus a change in the apparent arrival direction of H penetrating to 1 AU between the first two years of IBEX observations; these results are consistent with solar cycle variations in the radiation pressure, which works opposite to the Sun's gravitational force to effect the penetration of H into the inner heliosphere. Together, these six studies provide the first detailed analyses of the multi-component local interstellar mediumâa medium that both effects us by bounding and interacting with our heliosphere, and a\n\nChallenges in the determination of the interstellar flow longitude from the pickup ion cutoff\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaut, A.; Berger, L.; MÃ¶bius, E.; Drews, C.; Heidrich-Meisner, V.; Keilbach, D.; Lee, M. A.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R. F.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nContext. The interstellar flow longitude corresponds to the Sun's direction of movement relative to the local interstellar medium. Thus, it constitutes a fundamental parameter for our understanding of the heliosphere and, in particular, its interaction with its surroundings, which is currently investigated by the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX). One possibility to derive this parameter is based on pickup ions (PUIs) that are former neutral ions that have been ionized in the inner heliosphere. The neutrals enter the heliosphere as an interstellar wind from the direction of the Sun's movement against the partially ionized interstellar medium. PUIs carry information about the spatial variation of their neutral parent population (density and flow vector field) in their velocity distribution function. From the symmetry of the longitudinal flow velocity distribution, the interstellar flow longitude can be derived. Aim. The aim of this paper is to identify and eliminate systematic errors that are connected to this approach of measuring the interstellar flow longitude; we want to minimize any systematic influences on the result of this analysis and give a reasonable estimate for the uncertainty. Methods: We use He+ data measured by the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) sensor on the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory Ahead (STEREO A) spacecraft. We analyze a recent approach, identify sources of systematic errors, and propose solutions to eliminate them. Furthermore, a method is introduced to estimate the error associated with this approach. Additionally, we investigate how the selection of interplanetary magnetic field angles, which is closely connected to the pickup ion velocity distribution function, affects the result for the interstellar flow longitude. Results: We find that the revised analysis used to address part of the expected systematic effects obtains significantly different results than presented in the previous study.

A novel experimental approach for in situ atom detection, which has never been used earlier in space, is proposed. The technique is based on the conversion of neutral atoms to negative ions at a specially prepared sensitive surface. Negative ions are subsequently analyzed and detected in an essentially noise-free, multicoincidence mode. It is shown that interstellar hydrogen, deuterium, and oxygen atoms can be measured by the proposed technique. The experiment can be performed from a high-apogee Earth-orbiting satellite or from a deep space probe.\n\nElectromagnetic Forces on a Relativistic Spacecraft in the Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoang, Thiem; Loeb, Abraham\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA relativistic spacecraft of the type envisioned by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative will inevitably become charged through collisions with interstellar particles and UV photons. Interstellar magnetic fields would therefore deflect the trajectory of the spacecraft. We calculate the expected deflection for typical interstellar conditions. We also find that the charge distribution of the spacecraft is asymmetric, producing an electric dipole moment. The interaction between the moving electric dipole and the interstellar magnetic field is found to produce a large torque, which can result in fast oscillation of the spacecraft around the axis perpendicular to the direction of motion, with a period of Ë0.5 hr. We then study the spacecraft rotation arising from impulsive torques by dust bombardment. Finally, we discuss the effect of the spacecraft rotation and suggest several methods to mitigate it.\n\nA study of birefringence in the interstellar medium in the direction of the Crab Nebula\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMartin, P. G.; Angel, J. R. P.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe interstellar medium may be regarded as a weak wave plate, the linear birefringence arising from the aligned grains which produce interstellar linear polarization. Using the Crab Nebula as a background source of linearly polarized light we have investigated this birefringence by measurements of circular polarization. The circular component is found to vary with the intrinsic linear polarization in a sinusoidal fashion characteristic of a wave plate with the orientation expected from independent measurements of the interstellar linear polarization in the same direction. Measurements of the wavelength dependence, together with the sense and magnitude of the circular polarization are interpreted as evidence for the dielectric nature of the interstellar grain materials. These observations provide a firm basis for a similar interpretation of the circular polarization of reddened stars. The observations of the stars can then be used to study the grain composition and the structure of the magnetic field in many directions in the Galaxy.\n\nTopological signatures of interstellar magnetic fields - I. Betti numbers and persistence diagrams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMakarenko, Irina; Shukurov, Anvar; Henderson, Robin; Rodrigues, Luiz F. S.; Bushby, Paul; Fletcher, Andrew\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) is a magnetized system in which transonic or supersonic turbulence is driven by supernova explosions. This leads to the production of intermittent, filamentary structures in the ISM gas density, whilst the associated dynamo action also produces intermittent magnetic fields. The traditional theory of random functions, restricted to second-order statistical moments (or power spectra), does not adequately describe such systems. We apply topological data analysis (TDA), sensitive to all statistical moments and independent of the assumption of Gaussian statistics, to the gas density fluctuations in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the multiphase ISM. This simulation admits dynamo action, so produces physically realistic magnetic fields. The topology of the gas distribution, with and without magnetic fields, is quantified in terms of Betti numbers and persistence diagrams. Like the more standard correlation analysis, TDA shows that the ISM gas density is sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields. However, TDA gives us important additional information that cannot be obtained from correlation functions. In particular, the Betti numbers per correlation cell are shown to be physically informative. Magnetic fields make the ISM more homogeneous, reducing the abundance of both isolated gas clouds and cavities, with a stronger effect on the cavities. Remarkably, the modification of the gas distribution by magnetic fields is captured by the Betti numbers even in regions more than 300 pc from the mid-plane, where the magnetic field is weaker and correlation analysis fails to detect any signatures of magnetic effects.\n\nFirst Results from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) Mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcComas, David J.\n\n2010-03-01\n\nThe Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) is a Small Explorer mission designed to study the global interaction between the heliosphere and the local interstellar medium. IBEX does this by measuring energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) created by both solar wind ions and pickup ions in the solar wind when they charge exchange with cold interstellar neutrals drifting in from the interstellar medium. Because the ENAs are not magnetically confined, some of them propagate back into the inner heliosphere, where IBEX can detect them. IBEX was launched October 19th 2008, using a new launch technique that was also developed as a part of the IBEX project. The first scientific observations from IBEX were of ENAs coming from the Moon-these represented the first ever lunar ENA observations from any spacecraft and provided important information about the universal physical processes of backscatter and neutralization from complex planetary surfaces like the lunar regolith. Since then, IBEX has been collecting its first all-sky maps of heliospheric ENAs and initial direct, in situ observations of interstellar H, He, and O. At the time of this writing, these observations have been submitted and are under review for a special IBEX section of Science magazine nominally scheduled to be published in October 2009.\n\nThe physics of interstellar shock waves\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShull, J.

A.; Scheer, J.; Schwadron, N. A.; Witte, M.; Wurz, P.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nDue to the motion of the Sun relative to its neighborhood, the neutral gas of the local in-terstellar medium (LISM) flows through the inner heliosphere where it is subject to ioni-zation, the Sunâs gravity, and radiation pressure. Observing the resulting spatial distribu-tion and flow pattern of several interstellar gas species with UV backscatter, pickup ion, and neutral atom imaging techniques allows us to unravel the physical conditions of the LISM and its interaction with the heliosphere. Imaging of the neutral gas flow directly with energetic neutral atom (ENA) cameras yields the most accurate account of the ki-netic parameters of the interstellar gas, but so far this has been carried out only for He using Ulysses GAS. IBEX, which was launched in October 2008, provides the capability for simultaneous flow observations of several interstellar species with its triple-time-of-flight IBEX-Lo sensor. Because H and O are strongly affected by the heliospheric inter-face while He is not, a direct comparison between these species enables an independent assessment of the slowdown and heating processes in the outer heliosheath. Likewise, IBEX observations will constrain models of the heliospheric interaction and provide a test of the heliospheric asymmetry - recently inferred from Voyager and SOHO SWAN observations - that is seen as an indicator for the interstellar magnetic field direction. During the first half year of its mission IBEX has observed the interstellar He, O, and H flow. We will present an overview and preliminary analysis of these first interstellar mul-tispecies scans of the interstellar gas flow in spring and fall 2009.\n\nElectromagnetic Forces on a Relativistic Spacecraft in the Interstellar Medium\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHoang, Thiem; Loeb, Abraham, E-mail: thiemhoang@kasi.re.kr, E-mail: aloeb@cfa.harvard.edu\n\n2017-10-10\n\nA relativistic spacecraft of the type envisioned by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative will inevitably become charged through collisions with interstellar particles and UV photons.

Assuming the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) He flow parameters for the LISM, we obtain a strength of â¼2.7 Â± 0.2 Î¼G and a direction pointing away from galactic coordinates (28, 52) Â± 3Â° for the interstellar magnetic field as a result of fitting Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 in situ plasma measurements and IBEX energetic neutral atoms ribbon. When using UlyssesmoreÂ Â» parameters for the LISM He flow, we recently reported the same direction but with a strength of 2.2 Â± 0.1 Î¼G. First, we notice that with Ulysses He flow, our solution is in the expected hydrogen deflection plane (HDP). In contrast, for the IBEX He flow, the solution is â¼20Â° away from the corresponding HDP plane. Second, the long-term monitoring of the interplanetary H I flow speed shows a value of â¼26 km s{sup â1} measured upwind from the Doppler shift in the strong LyÎ± sky background emission line. All elements of the diagnosis seem therefore to support Ulysses He flow parameters for the interstellar state. In that frame, we argue that reliable discrimination between superfast, subfast, or superslow states of the interstellar flow should be based on most existing in situ and remote observations used together with global modeling of the heliosphere. For commonly accepted LISM ionization rates, we show that a fast interstellar bow shock should be standing off upstream of the heliopause.Â«Â less\n\nOn the cosmic ray diffusion in a violent interstellar medium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBykov, A. M.; Toptygin, I. N.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA variety of the available observational data on the cosmic ray (CR) spectrum, anisotropy and composition are in good agreement with a suggestion on the diffusion propagation of CR with energy below 10(15) eV in the interstellar medium. The magnitude of the CR diffusion coefficient and its energy dependence are determined by interstellar medium (ISM) magnetic field spectra. Direct observational data on magnetic field spectra are still absent. A theoretical model to the turbulence generation in the multiphase ISM is resented. The model is based on the multiple generation of secondary shocks and concomitant large-scale rarefactions due to supernova shock interactions with interstellar clouds. The distribution function for ISM shocks are derived to include supernova statistics, diffuse cloud distribution, and various shock wave propagation regimes. This permits calculation of the ISM magnetic field fluctuation spectrum and CR diffusion coefficient for the hot phase of ISM.\n\nA challenge for probing the statistics of interstellar magnetic fields: beyond the Planck resolution with Herschel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBracco, Andrea; AndrÃ©, Philippe; Boulanger, Francois\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe recent Planck results in polarization at sub-mm wavelengths allow us to gain insight into the Galactic magnetic field topology, revealing its statistical correlation with matter, from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), to molecular clouds (MCs) (Planck intermediate results. XXXII, XXXIII, XXXV). This correlation has a lot to tell us about the dynamics of the turbulent ISM, stressing the importance of considering magnetic fields in the formation of structures, some of which eventually undergo gravitational collapse producing new star-forming cores.Investigating the early phases of star formation has been a fundamental scope of the Herschel Gould Belt survey collaboration (http://gouldbelt-herschel.cea.fr), which, in the last years, has thoroughly characterized, at a resolution of few tens of arcseconds, the statistics of MCs, such as their filamentary structure, kinematics and column density.Although at lower angular resolution, the Planck maps of dust emission at 353GHz, in intensity and polarization, show that all MCs are complex environments, where we observe a non-trivial correlation between the magnetic field and their density structure. This result opens new perspectives on their formation and evolution, which we have started to explore.In this talk, I will present first results of a comparative analysis of the Herschel-Planck data, where we combine the high resolution Herschel maps of some MCs of the Gould Belt with the Planck polarization data, which sample the structure of the field weighted by the density.In particular, I will discuss the large-scale envelopes of the selected MCs, and, given the correlation between magnetic field and matter, I will show how to make use of the high resolution information of the density structure provided by Herschel to investigate the statistics of interstellar magnetic fields in the Planck data.\n\nInterstellar fullerene compounds and diffuse interstellar bands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOmont, Alain\n\n2016-05-01\n\nRecently, the presence of fullerenes in the interstellar medium (ISM) has been confirmed and new findings suggest that these fullerenes may possibly form from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM. Moreover, the first confirmed identification of two strong diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) with the fullerene, C60+, connects the long standing suggestion that various fullerenes could be DIB carriers. These new discoveries justify reassessing the overall importance of interstellar fullerene compounds, including fullerenes of various sizes with endohedral or exohedral inclusions and heterofullerenes (EEHFs). The phenomenology of fullerene compounds is complex. In addition to fullerene formation in grain shattering, fullerene formation from fully dehydrogenated PAHs in diffuse interstellar clouds could perhaps transform a significant percentage of the tail of low-mass PAH distribution into fullerenes including EEHFs. But many uncertain processes make it extremely difficult to assess their expected abundance, composition and size distribution, except for the substantial abundance measured for C60+. EEHFs share many properties with pure fullerenes, such as C60, as regards stability, formation/destruction and chemical processes, as well as many basic spectral features. Because DIBs are ubiquitous in all lines of sight in the ISM, we address several questions about the interstellar importance of various EEHFs, especially as possible carriers of diffuse interstellar bands. Specifically, we discuss basic interstellar properties and the likely contributions of fullerenes of various sizes and their charged counterparts such as C60+, and then in turn: 1) metallofullerenes; 2) heterofullerenes; 3) fulleranes; 4) fullerene-PAH compounds; 5) H2@C60. From this reassessment of the literature and from combining it with known DIB line identifications, we conclude that the general landscape of interstellar fullerene compounds is probably much richer than heretofore realized\n\nRADIO SYNCHROTRON FLUCTUATION STATISTICS AS A PROBE OF MAGNETIZED INTERSTELLAR TURBULENCE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHerron, C. A.; Gaensler, B. M.; Burkhart, Blakesley\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe investigate how observations of synchrotron intensity fluctuations can be used to probe the sonic and AlfvÃ©nic Mach numbers of interstellar turbulence, based on mock observations performed on simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We find that the structure function slope and a diagnostic of anisotropy that we call the integrated quadrupole ratio modulus both depend on the AlfvÃ©nic Mach number. However, these statistics also depend on the orientation of the mean magnetic field in the synchrotron emitting region relative to our line of sight, and this creates a degeneracy that cannot be broken by observations of synchrotron intensity alone. We concludemoreÂ Â» that the polarization of synchrotron emission could be analyzed to break this degeneracy, and suggest that this will be possible with the Square Kilometre Array.Â«Â less\n\nDeciphering the Local Interstellar Spectra of Primary Cosmic-Ray Species with HELMOD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoschini, M.

G.; Rozza, D.; Tacconi, M.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nLocal interstellar spectra (LIS) of primary cosmic ray (CR) nuclei, such as helium, oxygen, and mostly primary carbon are derived for the rigidity range from 10 MV to â¼200 TV using the most recent experimental results combined with the state-of-the-art models for CR propagation in the Galaxy and in the heliosphere. Two propagation packages, GALPROP and HELMOD, are combined into a single framework that is used to reproduce direct measurements of CR species at different modulation levels, and at both polarities of the solar magnetic field. The developed iterative maximum-likelihood method uses GALPROP-predicted LIS as input to HELMOD, which provides the modulated spectra for specific time periods of the selected experiments for modelâdata comparison. The interstellar and heliospheric propagation parameters derived in this study are consistent with our prior analyses using the same methodology for propagation of CR protons, helium, antiprotons, and electrons. The resulting LIS accommodate a variety of measurements made in the local interstellar space (Voyager 1) and deep inside the heliosphere at low (ACE/CRIS, HEAO-3) and high energies (PAMELA, AMS-02).\n\nFisk-Gloeckler Suprathermal Proton Spectrum in the Heliosheath and the Local Interstellar Medium\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCooper, John F.; Kasprzak, W. T.; Mahaffy, P. R.; Niemann, H. B.; Hartle, R. E.; Paschalidis, N.; Chornay, D.; Coplan, M.; Johnson, R. E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nConvergence of suprathermal keV-MeV proton and ion spectra approximately to the Fisk-Gloeckler (F-G) form j(E) = j(sub 0) E(sup -1.5) in Voyager land 2 heliosheath measurements is suggestive of distributed acceleration in Kolmogorov turbulence which may extend well beyond the heliopause into the local interstellar medium (LISM). Turbulence of this type is already indicated by interstellar radio scintillation measurements of electron density power spectra. Previously published extrapolations (Cooper et al., 2003, 2006) of the LISM proton spectrum from eV to GeV energies are highly consistent with the F-G power-law and further indicative of such turbulence and LISM effectiveness of the F-G cascade acceleration process. The LISM pressure computed from this spectrum well exceeds that from current estimates for the LISM magnetic field, so exchange of energy between the protons and the magnetic field would likely have a strong role in evolution of the turbulence as per the F-G theory and as long ago proposed for cosmic ray energies by Parker and others. Pressure-dependent estimates of the LISM field strength should not ignore this potentially strong and even dominant contribution from the plasma. Presence of high-beta suprathermal plasma on LISM field lines could significantly affect interactions with the heliospheric outer boundary region and might potentially account for distributed and more discrete features in ongoing measurements of energetic neutral emission from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission.\n\nThe Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe - A Mission to Discover the Origin of Particle Acceleration and its Fundamental Connection to the Global Interstellar Interaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchwadron, N.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nOur piece of cosmic real-estate, the heliosphere, is the domain of all human existence - an astrophysical case-history of the successful evolution of life in a habitable system. The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) was the first mission to explore the global heliosphere and in concert with Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 is discovering a fundamentally new and uncharted physical domain of the outer heliosphere. In parallel, Cassini/INCA maps the global heliosphere at energies ( 5-55 keV) above those measured by IBEX. The enigmatic IBEX ribbon and the INCA belt were unanticipated discoveries demonstrating that much of what we know or think we understand about the outer heliosphere needs to be revised. The global structure of the heliosphere is highly complex and influenced by competing factors ranging from the local interstellar magnetic field, suprathermal populations both within and beyond the heliopause, and the detailed flow properties of the LISM. Global heliospheric structure and microphysics in turn influences the acceleration of energetic particles and creates feedbacks that modify the interstellar interaction as a whole. The next quantum leap enabled by IMAP will open new windows on the frontier of Heliophysics and probe the acceleration of suprathermal and higher energy particles at a time when the space environment is rapidly evolving. IMAP ultimately connects the acceleration processes observed directly at 1 AU with unprecedented sensitivity and temporal resolution with the global structure of our heliosphere. The remarkable synergy between IMAP, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 will remain for at least the next decade as Voyager 1 pushes further into the interstellar domain and Voyager 2 moves through the heliosheath. IMAP, like ACE before it, will be a keystone of the Heliophysics System Observatory by providing comprehensive energetic particle, pickup ion, suprathermal ion, neutral atom, solar wind, solar wind heavy ion, and magnetic field observations to diagnose\n\nEffect of Supernovae on the Local Interstellar Material\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFrisch, Priscilla; Dwarkadas, Vikram V.\n\nA range of astronomical data indicates that ancient supernovae created the galactic environment of the Sun and sculpted the physical properties of the interstellar medium near the heliosphere. In this paper, we review the characteristics of the local interstellar medium that have been affected by supernovae. The kinematics, ma"
