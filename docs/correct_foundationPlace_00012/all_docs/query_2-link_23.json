Foreword Creating Value With Cloud In a reasonably short span of time, cloud computing has gained popularity and has become one of the most talked- about deployment models in the industry. One of the primary forces enabling the adoption of cloud computing has emerged from the enhancing interdependence of business and IT issues. Today, technology investments are more on improving business outcomes rather than traditional metrics of scope and speed. Driven by the pursuit of higher utilization of IT resources for cost reduction, organizations are experimenting with shared platforms operated by external service providers with higher levels of resource sharing. The internet has enabled IT related capabilities to be delivered as-a-service and the resources can be shared and interconnected between people, departments and companies. This highly flexible on-demand model holds particular importance for the telcos, not only because it depends on fast, efficient and dependable communication, but also because telcos can create value by leveraging their experience in offering IT centric managed services. Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam together encompass capabilities to roll out cloud leveraged next generation solutions through major investments in building cloud competency centre and partnering with pioneers in the field for joint research and development projects. We invite you to flip through the next few pages to gain further insight into this disruptive technology trend. Read on to find out a key partner, Oracle's approach and industry expert views on this emerging phenomenon, along with examples of how Tech Mahindra's solutions around cloud enablement create value!

Partner Speak: An In-depth Analysis: Oracle Cloud Computing Strategy Dhruv Singhal Director, Sales Consulting Oracle India It is interesting to see how cloud computing, a Oracle supports customers irrespective of model that has evolved from other utility and the type of cloud or non-cloud service distributed models like on-demand computing, they choose. grid computing, software-as-a-service, and Deliver most complete PaaS and IaaS virtualization will evolve further to deliver value product offerings Oracle provides the to both, the vendor and user organizations. most complete portfolio of software and Cloud encompasses the issues of both, the IT hardware products to enable and business worlds and has served to catalyze organizations build, deploy and manage the increasing realization of IT and business public and private PaaS and IaaS.

Its business model is built server based SDP solution to address the around the delivery of centralized and integration requirements of the client. The SDP standardized IT infrastructure services via the solution enabled the integration of client's BSS internet consumed as a simple subscription- system with various backend provisioning based service, as and when required. The client systems. needed a solution to automate provisioning of various products along with support around deployed products, and required the solution to Tech Mahindra's SDP platform is an integrated, provide a faster time to market for new products server-based software solution for building and and services. Tech Mahindra's SDP solution managing services using a service-oriented fetched rewarding returns to the client on the architecture (SOA). It is an extensible and above mentioned requirements. configurable framework which empowers on- boarding new services with minimal coding Business Needs of the Client efforts. This highly reusable solution provides The client required an integration solution for: facility for integrating third party services. Automated provisioning of various products like Exchange, Virtualization, Business Benefits: Software Provisioning, Network Sharing, SaaS software, etc., and deal with Improved SLA tracking leading to provisioning requirement of client's increased customer satisfaction. increasing number of customers.

Case Study 3 High End Server Migration Implementation for a Leading Tier 1 Operator Case Summary Tech Mahindra Solution and Business The client, a leading provider of Benefits telecommunication and ICT services in the To optimize the current environment, Tech Netherlands, offers wireline & wireless Mahindra enabled the client in scaling up telephony, TV and internet services to internally through virtualization. This required consumers and end-to-end telecom and ICT migration of the existing infrastructure to a new services to business to business customers. The consolidated and virtualized infrastructure. The provider has operations in 22 countries, and existing infrastructure was split into SUN and HP provides a sophisticated portfolio of IP and data servers and the task was to migrate from both services. The client needed a solution to these systems to the new unified SUN platform. optimize the current test environment, Client's existing infrastructure on the SUN consolidate old applications, minimize platform supported many disparate systems hardware footprint and cater to new business including systems running on SUN V880, SUN needs. Tech Mahindra implemented best E450, SUN V440, HP and Digital Compaq practices in consolidation & virtualization to platforms. The other systems were migrated serve the client needs thereby bringing about from DL 380 platform to SUN X Series platform active utilization of client's IT infrastructure. where all the features, for eg. XML builder, client Business Needs of the client accept module, mobile online activation etc. were bundled together. To optimize the current test environment by consolidation and virtualization. Business Benefits: To rebuild an environment to consolidate High performance of servers with old applications and also cater to new increased availability and scalability business needs. Attained 8:1 ratio on Windows The replication of testing requirement at system and 14:1 ratio on Solaris offshore required: server. Establishment of an environment to cater Seamless integration of disparate systems to production level testing. by using high level migration framework. Provisioning of equivalent computer power and setup. Minimization of hardware footprint via virtualization. To manage effective workforce for resolving customer/network problems. HOME 19\n\n22. Case Study 4 Performance Testing in Virtualized Environment Case Summary Tech Mahindra solution includes a set of baseline production user load scenarios in the The client, a leading provider of production environment to be identified with telecommunication services in Europe offers linear scaling behaviour by analyzing the daily wireline & wireless telephony, TV and internet traffic in production. services to consumers and end-to-end telecom services to businesses. The client needed a solution to optimize the current performance test environment, consolidate old applications, minimize hardware footprint and cater to new business needs. Tech Mahindra's role was to analyze and come up with the virtualization overheads in performance and system resource usage while using virtualized test environment for performance testing. The test environment findings were then extrapolated to production. Business Needs of the Client To optimize the current test environment by consolidation and virtualization. The same baseline production user load is Cost optimization on testing pumped to the test environment and environment. performance metrics gathered during the test To extrapolate performance results from run. virtualized test environment to the production environment. Tech Mahindra Solution and Business Benefits To come up with the virtualization overheads, the Tech Mahindra team chose CRM application and billing system for wireless customers. Performance testing criteria: The server configuration of the test environment needs to be similar to that of production environment. If this does not hold, the SPEC ratio* needs to be assessed. CPU resources need to be dedicated to particular platforms. Each tier though virtualized will use only CPUs assigned to them. 20\n\n23. To validate the similarity of the performance The CPU overhead for the virtualised behaviour between the two platforms, the environment is calculated from the above graph expected load on the scaled down production and the resultant factor is applied for the environment is calculated. subsequent performance test results on the virtualised environment. The same approach is adhered to come up with memory and I/O overheads. Business Benefits: Test server consolidation with significant reduction in OPEX and CAPEX costs. Reliable approach to extrapolate the virtualised environment results to non virtualised environments. Better scaling of per formance environment compared to production due to sharing of the underlying hardware in virtualised environment, and staggered testing timelines for different applications.
