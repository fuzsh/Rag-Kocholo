L.\n\n2000-11-01\n\nThe Î½12 band of trans-d2-ethylene (trans-C2H2D2) has been recorded with an unapodized resolution of 0.0024 cm-1 in the frequency range of 1240-1360 cm-1 by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This band was found to be relatively free from any local frequency perturbations. By fitting a total of 1185 infrared transitions of Î½12 with a standard deviation of 0.00043 cm-1 using a Watson's A-reduced Hamiltonian in the Ir representation, a set of accurate rovibrational constants for v12 = 1 state was derived. The Î½12 band is A type with a band center at 1298.03797 Â± 0.00004 cm-1.\n\nNear-infrared interferometry of Î· Carinae with spectral resolutions of 1 500 and 12 000 using AMBER/VLTI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeigelt, G.; Kraus, S.; Driebe, T.; Petrov, R.

The observations were performed with the AMBER instrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) using baselines from 42 to 89 m. The aim of this work is to study the wavelength dependence of Î· Car's optically thick wind region with a high spatial resolution of 5 mas (11 AU) and high spectral resolution. Methods: The observations were carried out with three 8.2 m Unit Telescopes in the K-band. The raw data are spectrally dispersed interferograms obtained with spectral resolutions of 1500 (MR-K mode) and 12 000 (HR-K mode). The MR-K observations were performed in the wavelength range around both the He I 2.059 Î¼m and the BrÎ³ 2.166 Î¼m emission lines, the HR-K observations only in the BrÎ³ line region. Results: The spectrally dispersed AMBER interferograms allow the investigation of the wavelength dependence of the visibility, differential phase, and closure phase of Î· Car. In the K-band continuum, a diameter of 4.0Â±0.2 mas (Gaussian FWHM, fit range 28-89 m baseline length) was measured for Î· Car's optically thick wind region. If we fit Hillier et al. (2001, ApJ, 553, 837) model visibilities to the observed AMBER visibilities, we obtain 50% encircled-energy diameters of 4.2, 6.5 and 9.6 mas in the 2.17 Î¼m continuum, the He I, and the BrÎ³ emission lines, respectively. In the continuum near the BrÎ³ line, an elongation along a position angle of 120Â°Â±15Â° was found, consistent with previous VINCI/VLTI measurements by van Boekel et al. (2003, A&A, 410, L37). We compare the measured visibilities with predictions of the radiative transfer model of Hillier et al. (2001), finding good agreement. Furthermore, we discuss the detectability of the hypothetical hot binary companion. For the interpretation of the non-zero differential and closure phases measured within the BrÎ³ line, we present a simple geometric model of an inclined, latitude-dependent wind zone.

T.; Yin, A.; Patthoff, D. A.; Schenk, P.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) recorded nine very high-resolution framesâeight at 12 m/pixel and one at 6 m/pixelâduring the E12 flyby of Europa in Dec. 1997. To understand the implications for the small-scale structure and evolution of Europa, we mosaicked these frames (observations 12ESMOTTLE01 and 02, incidence â18Â°, emission â77Â°) into their regional context (part of observation 11ESREGMAP01, 220 m/pixel, incidence â74Â°, emission â23Â°). The topography data, which was created from the image mosaic overlaps, is sparse and segmented over the high-resolution images but connected by the underlying regional resolution topography. The high-resolution topography (24 m/pixel) is among the best for the current Europan dataset. From this dataset we ascertain the root mean square, or RMS, slope for some of the most common Europan surface features in a new region. We also employ a Fourier Transform method previously used on Ganymede and on other areas of Europa (Patel et al., 1999 JGR), to derive common wavelengths for the subunits of the ubiquitous ridged plains terrain. These results have important implications for differentiating between possible formation mechanismsâextensional tilt blocks (Pappalardo et al., 1995 JGR) or folds (Leonard et al., 2015 LPSC Abstract)âand for potential future missions. We continue this method for another high-resolution region taken in the E12 orbit, WEDGES01 and 02, with the specific goal of investigating how the variations in ridged plains morphologies relate across the surface of Europa.\n\nA practical optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy prototype using a 300 mW visible laser diode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZeng, Lvming; Piao, Zhonglie; Huang, Shenghai; Jia, Wangcun; Chen, Zhongping\n\n2016-03-01\n\nOptical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is an emerging technique for microvasculature imaging at high spatial resolution and contrast. In this work, we present a practical visible laser-diode-based OR-PAM (LD-OR-PAM) prototype for vasculature imaging, which has the desirable properties of being portable, low-cost, and label-free. The prototype employs a 300 mW pulsed laser diode in a 3.8 mm diameter package, emitting 174 ns pulses at 405 +/- 5 nm wavelength and a pulse energy of 52 nJ. An aspheric objective with a numerical aperture of 0.60 is used to achieve microscope optical illumination. The laser diode excitation has a compact size of 4.5 Ã 1.8 Ã 1.8 cm3 assembled with a cooling block. The lateral resolution was tested to be 0.95 Î¼m on ~7 Î¼m carbon fibers. The subcutaneous microvasculature on a mouse back was label-free imaged ex vivo, which demonstrates the potential of the LD-OR-PAM prototype for in vivo imaging skin chromosphores such as hemoglobin. Our ultimate aim is to provide a practical and affordable OR-PAM system as a routine instrument for standard clinical applications.\n\nSpectroscopy of the novae M31N_2008-08a and M31N_2008-08b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDi Mille, F.; Ciroi, S.; Orio, M.; Rafanelli, P.; Bianchini, A.; Nelson, T.; Andreuzzi, G.\n\n2008-09-01\n\nWe obtained low resolution spectra of the two optical nova candidates in M31 (see ATEL #1654). The spectra were obtained with the 3.5-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo of INAF equipped with the DOLORES spectrograph and camera (spectral range 330-790 nm, resolution 1.2 nm) on Aug 17.13 for 2008-08a and on Aug 17.17 for 2008-08b (8 days after the discovery of both novae, which were below the detection limits 2 days earlier).\n\n3-D Spatial Resolution of 350 Î¼m Pitch Pixelated CdZnTe Detectors for Imaging Applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nYin, Yongzhi; Chen, Ximeng; Wu, Heyu; Komarov, Sergey; Garson, Alfred; Li, Qiang; Guo, Qingzhen; Krawczynski, Henric; Meng, Ling-Jian; Tai, Yuan-Chuan\n\n2013-02-01\n\nWe are currently investigating the feasibility of using highly pixelated Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) detectors for sub-500 Î¼ m resolution PET imaging applications. A 20 mm Ã 20 mm Ã 5 mm CdZnTe substrate was fabricated with 350 Î¼ m pitch pixels (250 Î¼ m anode pixels with 100 Î¼ m gap) and coplanar cathode. Charge sharing among the pixels of a 350 Î¼ m pitch detector was studied using collimated 122 keV and 511 keV gamma ray sources. For a 350 Î¼ m pitch CdZnTe detector, scatter plots of the charge signal of two neighboring pixels clearly show more charge sharing when the collimated beam hits the gap between adjacent pixels. Using collimated Co-57 and Ge-68 sources, we measured the count profiles and estimated the intrinsic spatial resolution of 350 Î¼ m pitch detector biased at -1000 V. Depth of interaction was analyzed based on two methods, i.e., cathode/anode ratio and electron drift time, in both 122 keV and 511 keV measurements. For single-pixel photopeak events, a linear correlation between cathode/anode ratio and electron drift time was shown, which would be useful for estimating the DOI information and preserving image resolution in CdZnTe PET imaging applications.\n\n3-D Spatial Resolution of 350 Î¼m Pitch Pixelated CdZnTe Detectors for Imaging Applications\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYin, Yongzhi; Chen, Ximeng; Wu, Heyu; Komarov, Sergey; Garson, Alfred; Li, Qiang; Guo, Qingzhen; Krawczynski, Henric; Meng, Ling-Jian; Tai, Yuan-Chuan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe are currently investigating the feasibility of using highly pixelated Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) detectors for sub-500 Î¼m resolution PET imaging applications.

M.; LMIRCam Instrument Team\n\n2013-06-01\n\nHST imaging of the famous red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris shows a complex circumstellar reflection nebula indicative of multiple asymmetric ejection episodes. Constructing a more complete picture of the mass loss mechanism compels extending high resolution imaging of massive stars such as VY CMa into the near-infrared, where the mechanism for emission from circumstellar ejecta transitions from scattering to thermal. We present LBT/LMIRCam observations of VY CMa at Ks (2.2 Î¼m), L' (3.8 Î¼m) and M (4.9 Î¼m) at sub-arcsecond resolution, comparable to the HST in the optical. The peculiar Southwest (SW) Clump, first identified as a highly reddened feature seen only at the longest wavelength (1 Î¼m) in the HST images, appears bright in the three LMIRCam filters. The SW Clump is found to be optically thick at all three wavelengths. A silicate grain model yields a lower limit mass on the order of 7E-4 Mâ\n\nThe structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of perovskite oxides PbM1/2Nb1/2O3 (M = Fe, Co and Ni)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErkisi, A.; Surucu, G.; Deligoz, E.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this study, the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of perovskite oxides PbM1/2Nb1/2O3 (M = Fe, Co and Ni) are investigated. The systems are treated in ferromagnetic order. The calculations are carried out in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) within the plane-wave pseudopotential method. The exchange-correlation potential is approximated by generalized-gradient spin approach (GGA). The intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion is also taken into account in calculations (GGA + U). We have considered two generalized-gradient spin approximation functionals, which are Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and PBE for solids (PBEsol) for structural parameter calculations when it included Hubbard potential. Although the spin-polarized electronic band structures of PbCo1/2Nb1/2O3 and PbNi1/2Nb1/2O3 systems exhibit metallic property in ferromagnetic phase, a bandgap is observed in spin-down states of PbFe1/2Nb1/2O3 resulting in half-metallic behavior. The main reason for this behavior is attributed to the hybridization between d-states of transition metal atoms and p-states of oxygen atoms. The stability mechanically and the calculated mechanical properties by using elastic constants show that these compounds are mechanically stable in tetragonal phase and have anisotropic character mechanically.\n\nAn all-electron density functional theory study of the structure and properties of the neutral and singly charged M12 and M13 clusters: M = Sc-Zn.\n\nPubMed\n\nGutsev, G L; Weatherford, C W; Belay, K G; Ramachandran, B R; Jena, P\n\n2013-04-28\n\nThe electronic and geometrical structures of the M12 and M13 clusters where M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn along with their singly negatively and positively charged ions are studied using all-electron density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation. The geometries corresponding to the lowest total energy states of singly and negatively charged ions of V13, Mn12, Co12, Ni13, Cu13, Zn12, and Zn13 are found to be different from the geometries of the corresponding neutral parents. The computed ionization energies of the neutrals, vertical electron detachment energies from the anions, and energies required to remove a single atom from the M13 and M13(+) clusters are in good agreement with experiment. The change in a total spin magnetic moment of the cation or anion with respect to a total spin magnetic moment of the corresponding neutral is consistent with the one-electron model in most cases, i.e., they differ by Â±1.0 Î¼(B). Exceptions are found only for Sc12(-), Ti12(+), Mn12(-), Mn12(+), Fe12(-), Fe13(+), and Co12(+).\n\n12 CFR 615.5356 - Notice of intent to issue a capital directive.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-01-01\n\n... 12 Banks and Banking 6 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Notice of intent to issue a capital directive. 615.5356 Section 615.5356 Banks and Banking FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION FARM CREDIT SYSTEM FUNDING AND FISCAL AFFAIRS, LOAN POLICIES AND OPERATIONS, AND FUNDING OPERATIONS Issuance of a Capital Directive...\n\nTracking: Conflicts and Resolutions.

An increasing number of studies has emphasized fair sensitivity values for the detection of tumors >1 cm, compared to XMM, particularly in situations where high glandular breast densities make mammographic interpretation difficult. In addition, SMM has demonstrated high specificity for cancer, compared to various functional and anatomic imaging modalities. However, large field-of-view (FOV) gamma cameras are difficult to position close to the breasts, which decreases spatial resolution and subsequently, the sensitivity of detection for tumors <1 cm. New dedicated detectors featuring small FOV and increased spatial resolution have recently been developed. In this setting, improvement in tumor detection sensitivity, particularly with regard to small cancers is expected. At Division of Nuclear Medicine, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, we have performed over 2000 SMM within the last 9 years. We have recently used a dedicated breast camera (LumaGEMâ¢) featuring a 12.8Ã12.8 cm 2 FOV and an array of 2Ã2Ã6 mm 3 discrete crystals coupled to a photon-sensitive photomultiplier tube readout. This camera is mounted on a mammography gantry allowing upright imaging, medial positioning and use of breast compression. Preliminary data indicates significant enhancement of spatial resolution by comparison with standard imaging in the first 10 patients. Larger series will be needed to conclude on sensitivity/specificity issues.\n\nRELAP5-3D Resolution of Known Restart/Backup Issues\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMesina, George L.; Anderson, Nolan A.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe state-of-the-art nuclear reactor system safety analysis computer program developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), RELAP5-3D, continues to adapt to changes in computer hardware and software and to develop to meet the ever-expanding needs of the nuclear industry. To continue at the forefront, code testing must evolve with both code and industry developments, and it must work correctly. To best ensure this, the processes of Software Verification and Validation (V&V) are applied. Verification compares coding against its documented algorithms and equations and compares its calculations against analytical solutions and the method of manufactured solutions. A form of this, sequentialmoreÂ Â» verification, checks code specifications against coding only when originally written then applies regression testing which compares code calculations between consecutive updates or versions on a set of test cases to check that the performance does not change. A sequential verification testing system was specially constructed for RELAP5-3D to both detect errors with extreme accuracy and cover all nuclear-plant-relevant code features. Detection is provided through a âverification fileâ that records double precision sums of key variables. Coverage is provided by a test suite of input decks that exercise code features and capabilities necessary to model a nuclear power plant. A matrix of test features and short-running cases that exercise them is presented. This testing system is used to test base cases (called null testing) as well as restart and backup cases. It can test RELAP5-3D performance in both standalone and coupled (through PVM to other codes) runs. Application of verification testing revealed numerous restart and backup issues in both standalone and couple modes. This document reports the resolution of these issues.Â«Â less\n\nMeasurement of the 115In(n,Î³)116 m In reaction cross-section at the neutron energies of 1.12, 2.12, 3.12 and 4.12 MeV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLawriniang, Bioletty Mary; Badwar, Sylvia; Ghosh, Reetuparna; Jyrwa, Betylda; Vansola, Vibha; Naik, Haladhara; Goswami, Ashok; Naik, Yeshwant; Datrik, Chandra Shekhar; Gupta, Amit Kumar; Singh, Vijay Pal; Pol, Sudir Shibaji; Subramanyam, Nagaraju Balabenkata; Agarwal, Arun; Singh, Pitambar\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe 115In(n,Î³)116 m In reaction cross section at neutron energies of 1.12, 2.12, 3.12 and 4.12 MeV was determined by using an activation and off-line Î³-ray spectrometric technique.

F.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCARMENES is a spectrograph for radial velocity surveys of M dwarfs with the aim of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting in the habitable zones of their host stars. To ensure an optimal use of the CARMENES guaranteed time observations, in this paper we investigate the correlation of activity and rotation for approximately 2200 M dwarfs, ranging in spectral type from M0.0 V to M9.0 V. We present new high-resolution spectroscopic observations with FEROS, CAFE, and HRS of approximately 500 M dwarfs. For each new observation, we determined its radial velocity and measured its HÎ± activity index and its rotation velocity. Additionally, we have multiple observations of many stars to investigate if there are any radial velocity variations due to multiplicity. The results of our survey confirm that early-M dwarfs are HÎ± inactive with low rotational velocities and that late-M dwarfs are HÎ± active with very high rotational velocities. The results of this high-resolution analysis comprise the most extensive catalogue of rotation and activity in M dwarfs currently available.

An emerging consensus from the three workshop series has been the identification of spatial discretization errors as a dominant error source in absolute as well as incremental drag prediction. This paper provides an overview of the collective experience from the workshop series regarding the effect of grid-related issues on overall drag prediction accuracy. Examples based on workshop results are used to illustrate the effect of grid resolution and grid quality on drag prediction, and grid convergence behavior is examined in detail. For fully attached flows, various accurate and successful workshop results are demonstrated, while anomalous behavior is identified for a number of cases involving substantial regions of separated flow. Based on collective workshop experiences, recommendations for improvements in mesh generation technology which have the potential to impact the state-of-the-art of aerodynamic drag prediction are given.\n\nEthical Issues in mHealth Research Involving Persons Living with HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLabrique, Alain B.; Kirk, Gregory D.; Westergaard, Ryan P.; Merritt, Maria W.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe aim to raise awareness and stimulate dialogue among investigators and research ethics committees regarding ethical issues that arise specifically in the design and conduct of mHealth research involving persons living with HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. Following a brief background discussion of mHealth research in general, we offer a case example to illustrate the characteristics of mHealth research involving people living with HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. With reference to a well-established systematic general ethical framework for biomedical research with human participants, we identify a range of ethical issues that have particular salience for the protection of participants in mHealth research on HIV/AIDS and substance abuse.

The telescope has a non-redundant, thinned-aperture array in a center-mount, single-structure space frame. It employs speckle interferometric imaging to achieve diffraction-limited resolution. The signal-to-noise ratio problem is mitigated by moving the wavelength of operation to the near-IR, and the image is sensed by a Silicon CCD. The steerable, single-structure array presents a constant pupil. The center-mount, radar-like mount enables low-earth orbit space objects to be tracked as well as increases stiffness of the space frame. In the preferred embodiment, the array has elemental telescopes with subaperture of 2.1 m in a circle-of-nine configuration. The telescope array has an effective aperture of 12 m which provides a diffraction-limited resolution of 0.02 arc seconds. Pathlength matching of the telescope array is maintained by an electro-optical system employing laser metrology. Speckle imaging relaxes pathlength matching tolerance by one order of magnitude as compared to phased arrays. Many features of the telescope contribute to substantial reduction in costs. These include eliminating the conventional protective dome and reducing on-site construction activites. The cost of the telescope scales with the first power of the aperture rather than its third power as in conventional telescopes.\n\nSpectroscopy of the nova candidate M31-2008-10b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDi Mille, F.; Ciroi, S.; Orio, M.; Rafanelli, P.; Bianchini, A.; Nelson, T.; Andreuzzi, G.\n\n2008-10-01\n\nWe obtained a low resolution spectrum of the nova candidate M31-2008-10b ( see CBAT M31 nova page) on 2008 October 26.12 UT.

DEMs are obtained from a variety of sources and generated in several ways. Nowadays, a few global-coverage elevation datasets are available for free (e.g., SRTM, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm; ASTER, http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/). When the matrix of a DEM is used also for computational purposes, the choice of the elevation dataset which better suits the target of the study is crucial. Recently, the increasing use of DEM-based numerical simulation tools (e.g. for gravity driven mass flows), would largely benefit from the use of a higher resolution/higher accuracy topography than those available at planetary scale. Similar elevation datasets are neither easily nor freely available for all countries worldwide. Here we introduce a new web resource which made available for free (for research purposes only) a 10 m-resolution DEM for the whole Italian territory. The creation of this elevation dataset was presented by Tarquini et al. (2007). This DEM was obtained in triangular irregular network (TIN) format starting from heterogeneous vector datasets, mostly consisting in elevation contour lines and elevation points derived from several sources. The input vector database was carefully cleaned up to obtain an improved seamless TIN refined by using the DEST algorithm, thus improving the Delaunay tessellation. The whole TINITALY/01 DEM was converted in grid format (10-m cell size) according to a tiled structure composed of 193, 50-km side square elements. The grid database consists of more than 3 billions of cells and occupies almost 12 GB of disk memory. A web-GIS has been created (http://tinitaly.pi.ingv.it/ ) where a seamless layer of images in full resolution (10 m) obtained from the whole DEM (both in color-shaded and anaglyph mode) is open for browsing. Accredited navigators are allowed to download the elevation dataset.\n\nEffect of fluoride exposure on mRNA expression of cav1.2 and calcium signal pathway apoptosis regulators in PC12 cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiao, Qiuxia; Zhang, Rui; Wang, Xiaoyu; Nian, Weiwei; Ke, Lulu; Ouyang, Wei; Zhang, Zigui\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis study investigated the effects of fluoride exposure on the mRNA expression of Cav1.2 calcium signaling pathway and apoptosis regulatory molecules in PC12 cells. The viability of PC12 cell receiving high fluoride (5.0mM) and low fluoride (0.5mM) alone or fluoride combined with L-type calcium channel (LTCC) agonist/inhibitor (5umol/L FPL6417/2umol/L nifedipine) was detected using cell counting kit-8 at different time points (2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 10, and 24h). Changes in the cell configuration were observed after exposing the cells to fluoride for 24h. The expression levels of molecules related to the LTCC were examined, particularly, Cav1.2, c-fos, CAMK II, Bax, and Bcl-2. Fluoride poisoning induced severe cell injuries, such as decreased PC12 cell activity, enhanced cell apoptosis, high c-fos, CAMKII, and Bax mRNA expression levels. Bcl-2 expression level was also reduced. Meanwhile, high fluoride, high fluoride with FPL64176, and low fluoride with FPL64176 enhanced the Cav1.2 expression level. In contrast, low fluoride, high fluoride with nifedipine, and low fluoride with nifedipine reduced the Cav1.2 expression level. Thus, Cav1.2 may be an important molecular target for the fluorosis treatment, and the LTCC inhibitor nifedipine may be an effective drug for fluorosis. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this research was to map irrigated agricultural areas and explain methods and protocols using remote sensing. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map irrigated agricultural areas as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify irrigated and non-irrigated areas. First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for irrigated areas. Second, surface water availability for irrigated areas is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern. A decision tree approach using Landsat 30 m one time data fusion with MODIS 250 m time-series data was adopted to classify, group, and label classes. Finally, classes were tested and verified using ground truth data and national statistics. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment for the irrigated classes varied between 67 and 93%. An irrigated area derived from remote sensing (32,421 ha) was 20-57% higher than irrigated areas reported by Ghana's Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA). This was because of the uncertainties involved in factors such as: (a) absence of shallow irrigated area statistics in GIDA statistics, (b) non-clarity in the irrigated areas in its use, under-development, and potential for development in GIDA statistics, (c) errors of omissions and commissions in the remote sensing approach, and (d) comparison involving widely varying data types, methods, and approaches used in determining irrigated area statistics\n\nPreparation of the CARMENES Input Catalogue: Low- and High-resolution Spectroscopy of M dwarfs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlonso-Floriano, F.

To achieve this, we obtained low-resolution (R Ë 1500) spectra of 752 M (and late K) dwarfs mostly fainter than J = 9 mag with CAFOS. For all of them, we derived spectral types with 0.5 subtypes accuracy. We also studied metallicity and surface gravity through spectral indices, and activity from pEW(HÎ±). Next, we observed over 600 M dwarfs at higher resolution (R = 30 000-48 000) with FEROS, CAFE and HRS. We determined rotational velocities, v sin{i} (Â±0.2-0.5 km s^{-1}), and radial velocities, V_r (Â±0.1-0.2 km s^{-1}), of the observed stars. From our observations, we identified high-activity, low-metallicity and low-gravity stars, single- and double-lined spectroscopic binaries and, specially, fast rotators, which should be discarded from any target list for exoplanet searches. Here we present preliminary results.\n\nCot/tpl2-MKK1/2-Erk1/2 controls mTORC1-mediated mRNA translation in Toll-like receptorâactivated macrophages\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLÃ³pez-PelaÃ©z, Marta; Fumagalli, Stefano; Sanz, Carlos; Herrero, Clara; Guerra, Susana; Fernandez, Margarita; Alemany, Susana\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCot/tpl2 is the only MAP3K that activates MKK1/2-Erk1/2 in Toll-like receptorâactivated macrophages. Here we show that Cot/tpl2 regulates RSK, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4E-BP phosphorylation after stimulation of bone marrowâderived macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly I:C, or zymosan. The dissociation of the 4E-BPâeIF4E complex, a key event in the cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation, is dramatically reduced in LPS-stimulated Cot/tpl2-knockout (KO) macrophages versus LPS-stimulated wild-type (Wt) macrophages. Accordingly, after LPS activation, increased cap-dependent translation is observed in Wt macrophages but not in Cot/tpl2 KO macrophages. In agreement with these data, Cot/tpl2 increases the polysomal recruitment of the 5Â´âTOP eEF1Î± and eEF2 mRNAs, as well as of inflammatory mediator geneâencoding mRNAs, such as tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and KC in LPS-stimulated macrophages. In addition, Cot/tpl2 deficiency also reduces total TNFÎ±, IL-6, and KC mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages, which is concomitant with a decrease in their mRNA half-lives. Macrophages require rapid fine control of translation to provide an accurate and not self-damaging response to host infection, and our data show that Cot/tpl2 controls inflammatory mediator geneâencoding mRNA translation in Toll-like receptorâactivated macrophages.

The technique involves measuring the spatial offset between all pairs of scans from their cross-correlation, converting the spatial offsets to relative wall motion through a global optimization, and finally translating from relative to absolute wall motion by interpolation over the M-mode image. The resulting detailed wall distension waveform has the potential to enhance existing vascular biomarkers, such as strain and compliance, as well as enable new ones.\n\nThe CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs.

R.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe CARMENES radial velocity (RV) survey is observing 324 M dwarfs to search for any orbiting planets. In this paper, we present the survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a resolution of at least R >80 000, and we measure its RV, HÎ± emission, and projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range 700-900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s-1 in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3-4 m s-1.\n\n55-mW, 1.2-V, 12-bit, 100-MSPS Pipeline ADCs for Wireless Receivers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIto, Tomohiko; Kurose, Daisuke; Ueno, Takeshi; Yamaji, Takafumi; Itakura, Tetsuro\n\nFor wireless receivers, low-power 1.2-V 12-bit 100-MSPS pipeline ADCs are fabricated in 90-nm CMOS technology. To achieve low-power dissipation at 1.2V without the degradation of SNR, the configuration of 2.5bit/stage is employed with an I/Q amplifier sharing technique. Furthermore, single-stage pseudo-differential amplifiers are used in a Sample-and-Hold (S/H) circuit and a 1st Multiplying Digital-to-Analog Converter (MDAC). The pseudo-differential amplifier with two-gain-stage transimpedance gain-boosting amplifiers realizes high DC gain of more than 90dB with low power. The measured SNR of the 100-MSPS ADC is 66.7dB at 1.2-V supply. Under that condition, each ADC dissipates only 55mW.\n\nHigh Resolution Melting Analysis for JAK2 Exon 14 and Exon 12 Mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRapado, Inmaculada; Grande, Silvia; Albizua, Enriqueta; Ayala, Rosa; HernÃ¡ndez, JosÃ©-Angel; Gallardo, Miguel; Gilsanz, Florinda; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nJAK2 mutations are important criteria for the diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. We aimed to assess JAK2 exon 14 and exon 12 mutations by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, which allows variation screening. The exon 14 analysis included 163 patients with polycythemia vera, secondary erythrocytoses, essential thrombocythemia, or secondary thrombocytoses, and 126 healthy subjects. The study of exon 12 included 40 JAK2 V617F-negative patients (nine of which had polycythemia vera, and 31 with splanchnic vein thrombosis) and 30 healthy subjects. HRM analyses of JAK2 exons 14 and 12 gave analytical sensitivities near 1% and both intra- and interday coefficients of variation of less than 1%. For HRM analysis of JAK2 exon 14 in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, clinical sensitivities were 93.5% and 67.9%, clinical specificities were 98.8% and 97.0%, positive predictive values were 93.5% and 79.2%, and negative predictive values were 98.8% and 94.6, respectively. Correlations were observed between the results from HRM and three commonly used analytical methods. The JAK2 exon 12 HRM results agreed completely with those from sequencing analysis, and the three mutations in exon 12 were detected by both methods. Hence, HRM analysis of exons 14 and 12 in JAK2 shows better diagnostic values than three other routinely used methods against which it was compared. In addition, HRM analysis has the advantage of detecting unknown mutations.

The production of moderate resolution (10 - 30 m) global burned area products would meet the needs of several user communities: improved carbon emission estimations due to heterogeneous landscapes and for local scale air quality and fire management applications (Mouillot et al. 2014; van der Werf et al. 2010). While the increased spatial resolution reduces the influence of mixed burnt/unburnt pixels and it would increase the spectral separation of burned areas, moderate resolution satellites have reduced temporal resolution (10 - 16 days). Fire causes a land-cover change spectrally visible for a period ranging from a few weeks in savannas to over a year in forested ecosystems (Roy et al. 2010); because clouds, smoke, and other optically thick aerosols limit the number of available observations (Roy et al. 2008; Smith and Wooster 2005), burned areas might disappear before they are observed by moderate resolution sensors. Data fusion from a constellation of different sensors has been proposed to overcome these limits (Boschetti et al. 2015; Roy 2015). In this study, we estimated the probability of moderate resolution satellites and virtual constellations (including Landsat-8/9, Sentinel-2A/B) to provide sufficient observations for burned area mapping globally, and by ecosystem. First, we estimated the duration of the persistence of the signal associated with burned areas by combining the MODIS Global Burned Area and the Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance Product by characterizing the post-fire trends in reflectance to determine the length of the period in which the burn class is spectrally distinct from the unburned and, therefore, detectable. The MODIS-Terra daily cloud data were then used to estimate the probability of cloud cover. The cloud probability was used at each location to estimate the minimum revisit time needed to obtain at least one\n\nA Positive Move: 12th Annual College M&O Cost Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAgron, Joe\n\n2006-01-01\n\nColleges placed more of an emphasis on maintenance and operations (M&O) this school year by increasing the amount spent on M&O as a percentage of total budget.

In order to map earthquake-triggered landslides, we provide details on the applicability and limitations of publicly available 3-day-post- and pre-earthquake imagery provided by GE from the FORMOSAT-2 (formerly ROCSAT-2; Republic of China Satellite 2). We interpreted landslides on the 8-m-resolution FORMOSAT-2 image by GE; as a result, 257 large landslides were mapped with the highest concentration along the Beichuan fault. An estimated density of 0.3 landslides/km2 represents a minimum bound on density given the resolution of available imagery; higher resolution data would have identified more landslides. This is a preliminary study, and further study is needed to understand the landslide characteristics in detail. Although it is best to obtain landslide locations and measurements from satellite imagery having high resolution, it was found that GE is an effective and rapid reconnaissance tool. ?? 2009 Springer-Verlag.\n\nLibraries of High and Mid-Resolution Spectra of F, G, K, and M Field Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMontes, D.\n\n1998-06-01\n\nI have compiled here the three libraries of high and mid-resolution optical spectra of late-type stars I have recently published. The libraries include F, G, K and M field stars, from dwarfs to giants. The spectral coverage is from 3800 to 1000 Ã , with spectral resolution ranging from 0.09 to 3.0 Ã . These spectra include many of the spectral lines most widely used as optical and near-infrared indicators of chromospheric activity. The spectra have been obtained with the aim of providing a library of high and mid-resolution spectra to be used in the study of active chromosphere stars by applying a spectral subtraction technique. However, the data set presented here can also be utilized in a wide variety of ways. A digital version of all the fully reduced spectra is available via FTP and the World Wide Web (WWW) in FITS format.\n\nHigh Resolution Infrared Heterodyne Spectroscopy: Ethylene bands at 10.5 MU m.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorozhenko, V.; Kostiuk, T.; Buhl, D.; Hewagama, T.; Livengood, T. A.; Kollyukh, A.\n\n1998-09-01\n\nHeterodyne Spectroscopy can make a significant contribution to remote studies of planetary atmospheres and other gaseous astronomical objects. Infrared heterodyne investigations of planetary atmospheres permit the determination of their composition, distribution of pressure and temperature with altitude, and the investigation of local physics and chemistry. This method is especially important for the investigation of atmospheric dynamics. It has a high spectral resolution ( lambda /Delta lambda ~ 10(7) ), which makes it possible to remotely determine the direction and speed of winds with an accuracy 2 m/s (J.Goldstein et al., 1991). However, in order to retrieve the atmospheric parameters from atmospheric line measurements, it is important to know the molecular parameters of the lines being measured. Ethylene (C_2H_4) is an important hydrocarbon present in atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan (e.g., T.Kostiuk et al., 1993). It is a product of methane chemistry in the stratospheres of these planets and has a complicated spectrum in the middle IR region. This makes it a very interesting and usable probe of physical-dynamical properties of these atmospheres. In this report we present initial results of laboratory investigations of absorption lines of ethylene in the nu_4 , nu {_7} and nu_ {10} bands near 10.5 mu m. The measurements were made using a laboratory infrared heterodyne spectrometer with the ethylene gas at temperatures 293-297K and pressures 0.05-50 Torr. Parameters of more than 150 lines were measured relative to lines in the P and R branches of the (12) CO_2 laser and in the P branch of the (14) CO_2 laser. Absolute frequencies of the stronger lines were determined to +/- 5.3*10(-5) cm(-1) . Their intensities were determined to ~10%. The dependence of the line width on pressure was determined. Comparison of our results with other experimental and theoretical results (J. Hillman et al.,1998) will be discussed.

In this context, Sentinel-1 radar images have made it possible to retrieve surface soil moisture with a high spatial and temporal resolution. This paper presents two methodologies for the retrieval of soil moisture from remotely-sensed SAR images, with a spatial resolution of 100 m. These algorithms are based on the interpretation of Sentinel-1 data recorded in the VV polarization, which is combined with Sentinel-2 optical data for the analysis of vegetation effects over a site in Urgell (Catalunya, Spain). The first algorithm has already been applied to observations in West Africa by Zribi et al., 2008, using low spatial resolution ERS scatterometer data, and is based on change detection approach. In the present study, this approach is applied to Sentinel-1 data and optimizes the inversion process by taking advantage of the high repeat frequency of the Sentinel observations. The second algorithm relies on a new method, based on the difference between backscattered Sentinel-1 radar signals observed on two consecutive days, expressed as a function of NDVI optical index. Both methods are applied to almost 1.5 years of satellite data (July 2015-November 2016), and are validated using field data acquired at a study site. This leads to an RMS error in volumetric moisture of approximately 0.087 mÂ³/mÂ³ and 0.059 mÂ³/mÂ³ for the first and second methods, respectively. No site calibrations are needed with these techniques, and they can be applied to any vegetation-covered area for which time series of SAR data have been recorded.\n\nExploiting MISR products at the full spatial resolution (275m) to document changes in land properties in and around the Kruger National Park, South Africa\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVerstraete, M. M.; Hunt, L. A.; Pinty, B.; Clerici, M.; Scholes, R. J.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nThe MISR instrument on NASA's Terra platform has been acquiring data globally and continuously for almost 10 years. A wide range of atmospheric and land products are operationally generated at the LaRC ASDC, at spatial resolutions of 1.1 km or coarser. Yet, the intrinsic spatial resolution of that sensor is 275m and 12 out of the 36 spectro-directional data channels are transmitted to the ground segment at that resolution. Recent algorithmic developments have permitted us to reconstruct reasonable estimates of the other 24 channels and to account for atmospheric effects at the full original spatial resolution. Spectro-directional reflectances have been processed to characterize the anisotropy of observed land surfaces and then optimally estimate various geophysical properties of the environment such as the fluxes of radiation in and out of plant canopies, the albedo, FAPAR, etc. These detailed products allow us to investigate ecological and environmental changes in much greater spatial and thematic detail than was previously possible. The paper outlines the various methodological steps implemented and exhibits concrete results for a region of moderate size (280 by 380 km) in South Africa. Practical downstream applications of this approach include monitoring desertification and biomass burning, documenting urbanization or characterizing the phenology of vegetation.\n\nTriggered O Star Formation in M20 via Cloud-Cloud Collision: Comparisons between High-resolution CO Observations and Simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorii, K.; Hattori, Y.; Hasegawa, K.; Ohama, A.; Haworth, T. J.; Shima, K.; Habe, A.; Tachihara, K.; Mizuno, N.; Onishi, T.; Mizuno, A.; Fukui, Y.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nUnderstanding high-mass star formation is one of the top-priority issues in astrophysics. Recent observational studies have revealed that cloud-cloud collisions may play a role in high-mass star formation in several places in the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Trifid Nebula M20 is a well-known Galactic H II region ionized by a single O7.5 star. In 2011, based on the CO observations with NANTEN2, we reported that the O star was formed by the collision between two molecular clouds Ë0.3 Myr ago. Those observations identified two molecular clouds toward M20, traveling at a relative velocity of 7.5 {km} {{{s}}}-1. This velocity separation implies that the clouds cannot be gravitationally bound to M20, but since the clouds show signs of heating by the stars there they must be spatially coincident with it. A collision is therefore highly possible. In this paper we present the new CO J = 1-0 and J = 3-2 observations of the colliding clouds in M20 performed with the Mopra and ASTE telescopes. The high-resolution observations revealed that the two molecular clouds have peculiar spatial and velocity structures, I.e., a spatially complementary distribution between the two clouds and a bridge feature that connects the two clouds in velocity space. Based on a new comparison with numerical models, we find that this complementary distribution is an expected outcome of cloud-cloud collisions, and that the bridge feature can be interpreted as the turbulent gas excited at the interface of the collision. Our results reinforce the cloud-cloud collision scenario in M20.\n\nMolecular oxygen adsorption and dissociation on Au12M clusters with M = Cu, Ag or Ir\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJimÃ©nez-DÃ­az, Laura M.; PÃ©rez, Luis A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work, we present a density functional theory study of the structural and electronic properties of isolated neutral clusters of the type Au12M, with M = Cu, Ag, or Ir. On the other hand, there is experimental evidence that gold-silver, gold-copper and gold-iridium nanoparticles have an enhanced catalytic activity for the CO oxidation reaction. In order to address these phenomena, we also performed density functional calculations of the adsorption and dissociation of O2 on these nanoparticles. Moreover, to understand the effects of Cu, Ag, and Ir impurity atoms on the dissociation of O2, we also analyze this reaction in the corresponding pure gold cluster. The results indicate that the substitution of one gold atom in a Au13 cluster by Ag, Cu or Ir diminishes the activation energy barrier for the O2 dissociation by nearly 1 eV. This energy barrier is similar for Au12Ag and Au12Cu, whereas for Au12Ir is even lower. These results suggest that the addition of other transition metal atoms to gold nanoclusters can enhance their catalytic activity towards the CO oxidation reaction, independently of the effect that the substrate could have on supported nanoclusters.\n\nSuper-resolution mapping using multi-viewing CHRIS/PROBA data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDwivedi, Manish; Kumar, Vinay\n\n2016-04-01\n\nHigh-spatial resolution Remote Sensing (RS) data provides detailed information which ensures high-definition visual image analysis of earth surface features. These data sets also support improved information extraction capabilities at a fine scale. In order to improve the spatial resolution of coarser resolution RS data, the Super Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) technique has become widely acknowledged which focused on multi-angular image sequences. In this study multi-angle CHRIS/PROBA data of Kutch area is used for SR image reconstruction to enhance the spatial resolution from 18 m to 6m in the hope to obtain a better land cover classification. Various SR approaches like Projection onto Convex Sets (POCS), Robust, Iterative Back Projection (IBP), Non-Uniform Interpolation and Structure-Adaptive Normalized Convolution (SANC) chosen for this study. Subjective assessment through visual interpretation shows substantial improvement in land cover details. Quantitative measures including peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity are used for the evaluation of the image quality. It was observed that SANC SR technique using Vandewalle algorithm for the low resolution image registration outperformed the other techniques. After that SVM based classifier is used for the classification of SRR and data resampled to 6m spatial resolution using bi-cubic interpolation. A comparative analysis is carried out between classified data of bicubic interpolated and SR derived images of CHRIS/PROBA and SR derived classified data have shown a significant improvement of 10-12% in the overall accuracy. The results demonstrated that SR methods is able to improve spatial detail of multi-angle images as well as the classification accuracy.\n\nSpectrophotometry of stars 9 - 12m north polar spectrophotometric sequence (NPSS) program.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSharipova, L.

Atmospheric extinction was controlled during the night by means of an energetically calibrated brightness standard. Absolute energy distributions of 12 stars, their synthetic magnitudes in the V band, and B-V color indices were obtained.\n\nAberration corrected 1.2-MV cold field-emission transmission electron microscope with a sub-50-pm resolution\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAkashi, Tetsuya; Takahashi, Yoshio; Tanigaki, Toshiaki, E-mail: toshiaki.tanigaki.mv@hitachi.com\n\n2015-02-16\n\nAtomic-resolution electromagnetic field observation is critical to the development of advanced materials and to the unveiling of their fundamental physics. For this purpose, a spherical-aberration corrected 1.2-MV cold field-emission transmission electron microscope has been developed. The microscope has the following superior properties: stabilized accelerating voltage, minimized electrical and mechanical fluctuation, and coherent electron emission. These properties have enabled to obtain 43-pm information transfer. On the bases of these performances, a 43-pm resolution has been obtained by correcting lens aberrations up to the third order. Observations of GaN [411] thin crystal showed a projected atomic locations with a separation of 44âpm.\n\nMRO's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE): Polar Science Expectations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcEwen, A.; Herkenhoff, K.; Hansen, C.; Bridges, N.; Delamere, W. A.; Eliason, E.; Grant, J.; Gulick, V.; Keszthelyi, L.; Kirk, R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is expected to launch in August 2005, arrive at Mars in March 2006, and begin the primary science phase in November 2006. MRO will carry a suite of remote-sensing instruments and is designed to routinely point off-nadir to precisely target locations on Mars for high-resolution observations. The mission will have a much higher data return than any previous planetary mission, with 34 Tbits of returned data expected in the first Mars year in the mapping orbit (255 x 320 km). The HiRISE camera features a 0.5 m telescope, 12 m focal length, and 14 CCDs. We expect to acquire approximately 10,000 observations in the primary science phase (approximately 1 Mars year), including approximately 2,000 images for 1,000 stereo targets. Each observation will be accompanied by a approximately 6 m/pixel image over a 30 x 45 km region acquired by MRO s context imager. Many HiRISE images will be full resolution in the center portion of the swath width and binned (typically 4x4) on the sides. This provides two levels of context, so we step out from 0.3 m/pixel to 1.2 m/pixel to 6 m/pixel (at 300 km altitude). We expect to cover approximately 1% of Mars at better than 1.2 m/pixel, approximately 0.1% at 0.3 m/pixel, approximately 0.1% in 3 colors, and approximately 0.05% in stereo. Our major challenge is to find the dey contacts, exposures and type morphologies to observe.\n\nSynergetic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Soil Moisture Mapping at 100 m Resolution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGao, Qi; Zribi, Mehrez\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe recent deployment of ESAâs Sentinel operational satellites has established a new paradigm for remote sensing applications.

Previous studies have shown that p53 is either mutated or defective in approximately 50% of human cancers; therefore restoring normal p53 activity in cancer cells might be an effective anticancer therapeutic approach. Herein, we designed a chimeric p53 protein flanked with the MyoD N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 1-62, called M3) and a poly-arginine (R12) cell penetrating signal in its N-and C-termini respectively. This chimeric protein, M3-p53-R12, can be expressed in E. coli and purified using immobilized metal ion chromatography followed by serial refolding dialysis. The purified M3-p53-R12 protein retains DNA-binding activity and gains of cell penetrating ability. Using MTT assay, we demonstrated that M3-p53-R12 inhibited the growth of K562, Jurkat as well as HL-60 leukemia cells carrying mutant p53 genes. Results from FACS analysis also demonstrated that transduction of M3-p53-R12 protein induced cell cycle arrest of these leukemia cells. Of special note, M3-p53-R12 has no apoptotic effect on normal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and leukocytes, highlighting its differential effects on normal and tumor cells. To sum up, our results reveal that purified recombinant M3-p53-R12 protein has functions of suppressing the leukemia cell lines' proliferation and launching cell apoptosis, suggesting the feasibility of using M3-p53-R12 protein as an anticancer drug. In the future we will test whether this chimeric protein can preferentially trigger the death of malignant cancer cells without affecting normal cells in animals carrying endogenous or xenographic tumors.

F.; Barba, M.; Jacquemart, M. F.; Willis, M. J.; GonzÃ¡lez, P. J.; McKee, C.; Samsonov, S. V.; Feng, W.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDifferential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) can measure surface deformation at the centimeter level and, as a result, has been used to investigate a wide variety of natural hazards since the 1990s. In general, short spatial and temporal baselines are selected to reduce decorrelation and the effect of incorrect removal of the topographic component in differential interferograms. The nearly global coverage of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEMs) significantly simplified and improved the modelling and removal of topography for differential interferometric applications. However, DEMs are produced today at much finer resolutions, although with varying availability and cost. SRTM DEMs are freely available at 30 m resolution world-wide and 10 m resolution in the US. The TanDEM-X mission has produced a worldwide DEM at 12 m, although it is not generally free of cost. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEMs can provide better than 1m resolution, but are expensive to produce over limited extents. Finally, DEMs from optical data can be produced from Digital Globe satellite images over larger regions at resolutions of less than 1 m, subject to various restrictions. It can be shown that the coherence quality of a DInSAR image is directly related to the DEM resolution, improving recovery of the differential phase by significantly reducing the geometric decorrelation, and that the number of recovered pixels significantly increases with higher resolutions, particularly in steep topography. In this work we quantify that improvement for varying resolutions, from 1 to 30 m, and slopes and investigate its effect on the characterization of landslides in different regions and with a variety of surface conditions, including Greenland, Alaska, California, and the Canary Islands.\n\nHigh-resolution IR Absorption Spectroscopy of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the 3 Î¼m Region: Role of Periphery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaltseva, Elena; Petrignani, Annemieke; Candian, Alessandra; Mackie, Cameron J.; Huang, Xinchuan; Lee, Timothy J.; Tielens, Alexander G. G. M.; Oomens, Jos; Buma, Wybren Jan\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn this work we report on high-resolution IR absorption studies that provide a detailed view on how the peripheral structure of irregular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) affects the shape and position of their 3 Î¼m absorption band. For this purpose, we present mass-selected, high-resolution absorption spectra of cold and isolated phenanthrene, pyrene, benz[a]antracene, chrysene, triphenylene, and perylene molecules in the 2950-3150 cm-1 range. The experimental spectra are compared with standard harmonic calculations and anharmonic calculations using a modified version of the SPECTRO program that incorporates a Fermi resonance treatment utilizing intensity redistribution. We show that the 3 Î¼m region is dominated by the effects of anharmonicity, resulting in many more bands than would have been expected in a purely harmonic approximation. Importantly, we find that anharmonic spectra as calculated by SPECTRO are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. Together with previously reported high-resolution spectra of linear acenes, the present spectra provide us with an extensive data set of spectra of PAHs with a varying number of aromatic rings, with geometries that range from open to highly condensed structures, and featuring CH groups in all possible edge configurations. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the comparison of these spectra on the interpretation of the appearance of the aromatic infrared 3 Î¼m band, and on features such as the two-component emission character of this band and the 3 Î¼m emission plateau.\n\nSeparation of Pygmy Dipole and M1 Resonances in Zr90 by a High-Resolution Inelastic Proton Scattering Near 0Â°\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIwamoto, C.; Utsunomiya, H.; Tamii, A.; Akimune, H.; Nakada, H.; Shima, T.; Yamagata, T.; Kawabata, T.; Fujita, Y.; Matsubara, H.; Shimbara, Y.; Nagashima, M.; Suzuki, T.; Fujita, H.; Sakuda, M.; Mori, T.; Izumi, T.; Okamoto, A.; Kondo, T.; Bilgier, B.; Kozer, H. C.; Lui, Y.-W.; Hatanaka, K.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nA high-resolution measurement of inelastic proton scattering off Zr90 near 0Â° was performed at 295 MeV with a focus on a pronounced strength previously reported in the low-energy tail of giant dipole resonance. A forest of fine structure was observed in the excitation energy region 7-12 MeV. A multipole decomposition analysis of the angular distribution for the forest was carried out using the ECIS95 distorted-wave Born approximation code with the Hartree-Fock plus random-phase approximation model of E1 and M1 transition densities and inclusion of E1 Coulomb excitation. The analysis separated pygmy dipole and M1 resonances in the forest at EPDR=9.15Â±0.18MeV with ÎPDR=2.91Â±0.64MeV and at EM1=9.53Â±0.06MeV with ÎM1=2.70Â±0.17MeV in the Lorentzian function, respectively. The B(E1)â value for pygmy dipole resonance over 7-11 MeV is 0.75Â±0.08e2fm2, which corresponds to 2.1Â±0.2% of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule.\n\nThe spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding in the perimenopausal years\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShapley, M; Blagojevic, M; Jordan, KP; Croft, PR\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To obtain estimates of the rate of spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding and to explore any association with specific menstrual symptoms. Design Two-year prospective cohort study. Setting Seven general practices, with 67 100 registered patients. Population All women aged 40â54 years on the practices ageâsex registers. Methods Baseline postal questionnaire, with follow-up questionnaires sent to naturally menstruating respondents at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Main outcome measures Rate of spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding in naturally menstruating women. Results A total of 7121 baseline questionnaires were sent out, with an initial response rate of 63%. We recruited 2051 naturally menstruating women for the prospective cohort study. The spontaneous rate of resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding varied from 8.1% (95% CI 5.3â12%) in women aged 45â49 years, who had resolution without recurrence for 24 months, to 35% (95% CI 30â41%) in women aged 50â54 years, who had resolution without recurrence for 6 months. Rates were lower in those who reported interference with life from heavy menstrual bleeding. There was a strong association between the spontaneous resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding and skipped periods in women aged over 45 years. The association with âcycle too variable to sayâ was significant, but weaker. Conclusion There is a high prevalence, incidence and significant spontaneous rate of resolution of heavy menstrual bleeding in naturally menstruating women during the perimenopausal years. The rates have potential use for individual women, clinical decisions, devising and implementing interventions and planning the care of populations.

However, intracellular information to distinguish live cells remains largely inaccessible. Here, we develop a method for high-resolution identification and separation of cell types by quantifying multiple microRNA (miRNA) activities in live cell populations. We found that a set of miRNA-responsive, in vitro synthesized mRNAs identify a specific cell population as a sharp peak and clearly separate different cell types based on less than two-fold differences in miRNA activities. Increasing the number of miRNA-responsive mRNAs enhanced the capability for cell identification and separation, as we precisely and simultaneously distinguished different cell types with similar miRNA profiles. In addition, the set of synthetic mRNAs separated HeLa cells into subgroups, uncovering heterogeneity of the cells and the level of resolution achievable. Our method could identify target live cells and improve the efficiency of cell purification from heterogeneous populations.\n\nInfluence of Human Factor Issues on Patient-Centered mHealth Apps' Impact; Where Do We Stand?\n\nPubMed\n\nWildenbos, G A; Peute, L W; Jaspers, M W M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses the preliminary results of a literature review on studies published in 2014-2015 concerning patient-centered mHealth applications' (apps) impact.

Nine studies reported a positive impact of the patient-centered mHealth app on patient care; 4 of these studies were randomized controlled trials. Measured impacts in the 17 studies focused on improving patients' physical activity, self-efficacy and medication adherence. Human factors issues potentially mediating these effects were discussed in all studies. Transitions in the interaction between healthcare providers and their patients were most often discussed as influencing the impact of the mHealth app. More research is needed, focussing on human issues mediating the effect of patient-centered mHealth apps to precipitate knowledge on the effectiveness of mHealth. This research should preferably be guided by socio-technical models.\n\nElectronic structure, stability and magnetic properties of small M1-2Cr (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloy encapsulated inside a (BN)48 cage\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Wenjuan; Jia, Jianfeng; Lv, Jin; Wu, Haishun\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe geometrical structure and magnetic properties of M1-2Cr (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) alloy clusters inside a (BN)48 cage were calculated at the BPW91/LANL2DZ level of theory. The doping with Cr significantly changed the magnetic properties of the transition-metal clusters. When M1-2Cr alloys were placed inside a (BN)48 cage, the alloy clusters interacted strongly with the cage, and the M1-2Cr@(BN)48 clusters showed high stability. Moreover, Cr-doped magnetic metal clusters preferably occupied positions off-center and near the hexagonal rings of (BN)48 cages. Thus, the (BN)48 cages can be used to increase the stability of M1-2Cr alloys, and retain their magnetic nature, except for CoCr and Ni2Cr clusters.\n\nDual mTORC1/2 inhibition in a preclinical xenograft tumor model of endometrial cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKorets, Sharmilee Bansal; Musa, Fernanda; Curtin, John; Blank, Stephanie V.; Schneider, Robert J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives Up to 70% of endometrioid endometrial cancers carry PTEN gene deletions that can upregulate mTOR activity. Investigational mTOR kinase inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic approach for these tumors. Using a xenograft tumor model of endometrial cancer, we assessed the activity of mTOR and downstream effector proteins in the mTOR translational control pathway after treatment with a dual mTOR Complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2) catalytic inhibitor (PP242) compared to that of an allosteric mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor (everolimus, RAD001). Methods Grade 3 endometrioid endometrial cancer cells (AN3CA) were xenografted into nude mice. Animals were treated with PP242; PP242 and carboplatin; carboplatin; RAD001; RAD001 and carboplatin. Mean tumor volume was compared across groups by ANOVA. Immunoblot analysis was performed to assess mTORC1/2 activity using P-Akt, P-S6 and P-4E-BP1. Results The mean tumor volume of PP242 + carboplatin was significantly lower than in all other treatment groups, P<0.001 (89% smaller). The RAD001 + carboplatin group was also smaller, but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.097). Immunoblot analysis of tumor lysates treated with PP242 demonstrated inhibition of activated P-Akt. Conclusions Catalytic mTORC1/2 inhibition demonstrates clear efficacy in tumor growth control that is enhanced by the addition of a DNA damage agent, carboplatin. Targeting mTORC1/2 leads to inhibition of Akt activation and strong downregulation of effectors of mTORC1, resulting in downregulation of protein synthesis. Based on this study, mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitors warrant further investigation as a potential treatment for endometrial cancer.

Men and women with renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 60â89 mL/min [mild, n = 8], 30â59 mL/min [moderate, n = 8], or <30 mL/min [severe, n = 8]) or demographically healthy matched (control) subjects (n = 24) received a single oral dose of apremilast 30 mg. Plasma apremilast and metabolite M12 concentrations were determined, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from samples obtained predose and up to 72 hours postdose. In subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment, apremilast pharmacokinetic profiles were similar to healthy matched subjects. In subjects with severe renal impairment, apremilast elimination was significantly slower, and exposures based on area under the plasma concentrationâversusâtime curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity and maximum observed plasma concentration were increased versus healthy matched subjects. Metabolite M12 pharmacokinetic profiles for subjects with mild renal impairment were similar to those of the healthy matched subjects; however, they were increased in both the moderate and severe renally impaired subjects. Dose reduction of apremilast is recommended in individuals with severe renal impairment, but not in those with mild to moderate renal impairment.

For this purpose, we present mass-selected, high-resolution absorption spectra of cold and isolated phenanthrene, pyrene, benz[a]antracene, chrysene, triphenylene, and perylene molecules in the 2950â3150 cm{sup â1} range. The experimental spectra are compared with standard harmonic calculations and anharmonic calculations using a modified version of the SPECTRO program that incorporates a Fermi resonance treatment utilizing intensity redistribution. We show that the 3 Î¼moreÂ Â» m region is dominated by the effects of anharmonicity, resulting in many more bands than would have been expected in a purely harmonic approximation. Importantly, we find that anharmonic spectra as calculated by SPECTRO are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. Together with previously reported high-resolution spectra of linear acenes, the present spectra provide us with an extensive data set of spectra of PAHs with a varying number of aromatic rings, with geometries that range from open to highly condensed structures, and featuring CH groups in all possible edge configurations. We discuss the astrophysical implications of the comparison of these spectra on the interpretation of the appearance of the aromatic infrared 3 Î¼ m band, and on features such as the two-component emission character of this band and the 3 Î¼ m emission plateau.Â«Â less\n\nComparative study of A-site order in the lead-free bismuth titanates M{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ag, Tl) from first-principles\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGrÃ¶ting, Melanie, E-mail: groeting@mm.tu-darmstadt.de; Albe, Karsten, E-mail: albe@mm.tu-darmstadt.de\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWe investigate the possibility of enhancing chemical order in the relaxor ferroelectric Na{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} upon substitution of Na{sup +} by other monovalent cations M{sup +} using total energy calculations based on density functional theory. All chemically available monovalent cations M{sup +}, which are Li, Na, Ag, K, Tl, Rb and Cs, are considered and an analysis of the structurally relaxed structures in terms of symmetry-adapted distortion modes is given in order to quantify the chemically induced structural distortions. We demonstrate that the replacement of Na{sup +} by other monovalent cations can hardly alter the tendency of chemical ordermoreÂ Â» with respect to Na{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3}. Only Tl{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} and Ag{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} show enhanced tendency for chemical ordering. Both heavy metals behave similar to the light alkali metals in terms of structural relaxations and relative stabilities of the ordered configurations. Although a comparison of the Goldschmidt factors of components (M TiO{sub 3}){sup â} reveals for Tl a value above the upper stability limit for perovskites, the additional lone-pair effect of Tl{sup +} stabilizes the ordered structure. - Graphical abstract: Amplitudes of chemically induced distortion modes in different ordered perovskites M{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} and visualisation of atomic displacements associated with distortion mode X{sup +}{sub 1} in the 001-ordered compounds Li{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} and Cs{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3}. Due to a substantial size mismatch between bismuth (green) and caesium (dark blue), incorporation of the latter leads to enhanced displacements of oxygen atoms (red) and suppresses displacements of titanium (silver) as compared to lithium (light blue) or other smaller monovalent cations. - Highlights: â¢ Lead-free A-site mixed bismuth titanates M{sub 1/2}Bi{sub 1/2}TiO{sub 3} are studied by first-principles calculations. â\n\nCoregistration of high-resolution Mars orbital images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSidiropoulos, Panagiotis; Muller, Jan-Peter\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe systematic orbital imaging of the Martian surface started 4 decades ago from NASA's Viking Orbiter 1 & 2 missions, which were launched in August 1975, and acquired orbital images of the planet between 1976 and 1980. The result of this reconnaissance was the first medium-resolution (i.e. â¤ 300m/pixel) global map of Mars, as well as a variety of high-resolution images (reaching up to 8m/pixel) of special regions of interest. Over the last two decades NASA has sent 3 more spacecraft with onboard instruments for high-resolution orbital imaging: Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) having onboard the Mars Orbital Camera - Narrow Angle (MOC-NA), Mars Odyssey having onboard the Thermal Emission Imaging System - Visual (THEMIS-VIS) and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) having on board two distinct high-resolution cameras, Context Camera (CTX) and High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). Moreover, ESA has the multispectral High resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) onboard ESA's Mars Express with resolution up to 12.5m since 2004. Overall, this set of cameras have acquired more than 400,000 high-resolution images, i.e. with resolution better than 100m and as fine as 25 cm/pixel. Notwithstanding the high spatial resolution of the available NASA orbital products, their accuracy of areo-referencing is often very poor. As a matter of fact, due to pointing inconsistencies, usually form errors in roll attitude, the acquired products may actually image areas tens of kilometers far away from the point that they are supposed to be looking at. On the other hand, since 2004, the ESA Mars Express has been acquiring stereo images through the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), with resolution that is usually 12.5-25 metres per pixel. The achieved coverage is more than 64% for images with resolution finer than 20 m/pixel, while for ~40% of Mars, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) have been produced with are co-registered with MOLA [Gwinner et al., 2010]. The HRSC images and DTMs\n\nHigh-resolution optical imaging of the core of the globular cluster M15 with FastCam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDÃ­az-SÃ¡nchez, Anastasio; PÃ©rez-Garrido, Antonio; VillÃ³, Isidro; Rebolo, Rafael; PÃ©rez-Prieto, Jorge A.; Oscoz, Alejandro; Hildebrandt, Sergi R.; LÃ³pez, Roberto; RodrÃ­guez, Luis F.\n\n2012-07-01\n\nWe present high-resolution I -band imaging of the core of the globular cluster M15 obtained at the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope with FastCam, a low readout noise L3CCD-based instrument. Short exposure times (30 ms) were used to record 200 000 images (512 Ã 512 pixels each) over a period of 2 h and 43 min. The lucky imaging technique was then applied to generate a final image of the cluster centre with full width at half-maximum Ë0.1 arcsec and 13 Ã 13 arcsec 2 field of view. We obtained a catalogue of objects in this region with a limiting magnitude of I = 19.5. I -band photometry and astrometry are reported for 1181 stars. This is the deepest I -band observation of the M15 core at this spatial resolution. Simulations show that crowding is limiting the completeness of the catalogue. At shorter wavelengths, a similar number of objects have been reported using Hubble Space Telescope (HST )/Wide Field Planetary Camera observations of the same field. The cross-match with the available HST catalogues allowed us to produce colour-magnitude diagrams where we identify new blue straggler star candidates and previously known stars of this class.\n\nDesign of a self-aligned, wide temperature range (300 mK-300 K) atomic force microscope/magnetic force microscope with 10 nm magnetic force microscope resolution\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKarcÄ±, ÃzgÃ¼r; Department of Nanotechnology and Nanomedicine, Hacettepe University, Beytepe, 06800 Ankara; Dede, MÃ¼nir\n\nWe describe the design of a wide temperature range (300 mK-300 K) atomic force microscope/magnetic force microscope with a self-aligned fibre-cantilever mechanism.
