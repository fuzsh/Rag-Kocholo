        "text": "ALL-INCLUSIVE ENGAGEMENT IN ARCHITECTURE\n\nPUBLICATION CALL FOR CASE STUDIES\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nEight projects on the topic of All-Inclusive Engagement in Architecture will be selected by peer-review and will be included in an upcoming publication edited by Farhana Ferdous and Bryan Bell.\n\nThe case studies sought should present socially engaged architecture as a broad project that demonstrate new innovative modes of architectural production that serve through architecture a multitude of “others” – those who live in poverty, are being victimized, forced into being refugees, suffering famine or homelessness. The book terms this work, taken as a whole, all-inclusive engagement.\n\nThe proposed book offers a framework of scholarship to understand various aspects of an emerging architectural culture broadly through critical discussion of theoretical, methodological and empirical evidence. Variously termed as public interest design, humanitarian architecture, pro-bono architecture, participatory architecture, and/or community architecture, the modernist utopia— architecture as an instrument of social change has returned to recent architectural discourse with a vengeance to the degree that it conceives a radical reformation of the profession and its relationship to society. While much of the available scholarship on social engagement in architecture is portrayed as a sheer pragmatic response to the economically divisive world, the proposed volume argues that this emerging trend requires a deeper theoretical analysis.\n\nCurrent literature presents a disjunction between action-based community-engaged projects and theoretically based scholarship as a major gap in knowledge in the education of Architecture and Public Interest Design. To fill this gap, we seek field-based case studies that also establish a theoretical foundation to assess the scope, limitations, diversities, and possibilities of their social engagement. Although there are a number of good books on this topic, which is evidence of the burgeoning market of readers of the subject, most focus on discussing the working methods, techniques, and various pragmatic aspects of socially engaged architecture. This book will fill the lacuna by giving an in-depth analysis of all-inclusive engagement from socio-cultural contexts that framed the practice, as well as address the inadequate theoretical discussion on the topic.\n\nTwo case study projects will be selected for each of the following four topics:\n\nI. Design Pedagogy\n\nII. Theory and Scholarship\n\nIII. Contemporary Practice and Digital Engagement\n\nIV. Community Health and Engaged Urbanism\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n10 January 2018: Submissions due by author including name, institution/organization, project title, 300 word abstract, 8-10 images (med/low resolution). Select one of the four topic areas from list above and include as first key word.\n\n5 February 2018: Editors shortlist the project, send the invitation to submit the draft chapters\n\n1 March 2018: Author submits 1500 words chapter with maximum 10 high-resolution images with copyright permission and release by each subject included\n\n31 March 2018: Editors send the chapters for the peer-review process\n\n15 April 2018: Editors send the reviewers comments to the authors\n\n30 May 2018: Author submits the final chapter to the editors\n\nSUBMITAL LINK: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=2018callforcasestudi\n\nCALL FOR PROJECTS INFORMATION:\n\nhttps://easychair.org/cfp/Publication_Call_for_Case_Studies_All_Inclusive_Engagement_2018\n\nSUBMISSION PROCESS INFORMATION: https://easychair.org/help/article.cgi?art=how_to_submit;a=16742638\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nDrawing Ambience: Alvin Boyarsky and the Architectural Association is the first public museum exhibition of drawings from the private collection of Boyarsky, arguably one of the most influential figures in 20th-century design education and the longtime chair of the Architectural Association in London. It also explores Boyarsky’s role as a collector of drawings and, metaphorically speaking, of the ideas and people that have come to define a key moment in architectural history. The exhibition is co-organized by the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum and the Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design (RISD Museum). It is curated by Igor Marjanovi_, associate professor of architecture in the Sam Fox School, and Jan Howard, curator of prints, drawings and photographs and curatorial chair at the RISD Museum. Marjanovic participated in numerous programs related to the exhibition, including gallery talks and a panel discussion with Chris Bardt, Jan Howard, and Lesley Lokko.\n\n–\n\nAssistant professor Derek Hoeferlin and associate professor John Hoal presented a MISI-ZIIBI workshop studying climate change issues in Brisbane, Australia, during the Deltas in Times of Climate Change conference. Hoeferlin and Hoal, were both instrumental in the redesign of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. In addition, the two faculty took a ride down the Mississippi River with KPLR’s Patrick Clark in an effort to encourage St. Louis residents to look towards the future. Work for MISI-ZIIBI: Living with the Great Rivers was also featured in an exhibit at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference. Their exhibit, funded in part by a WUSTL I-CARES grant, will display multidisciplinary research that deploys a workshop framework methodology and climate adaptation performance model for climate change scenario planning for multiuse “fluvial zones” along the Mississippi River basins and abroad. Lecturer Jonathan Stitelman produced the exhibit design.\n\n–\n\nAssociate professors Sung Ho Kim and Heather Woofter, co-founders of Axi:Ome, discussed ways urban spaces can connect through art at the CEL Center for Architecture + Design, as part of St. Louis Design Week.\n\n–\n\nAssociate professor Zeuler R. Lima, PhD, delivered the opening lecture for the exhibition 3 Sites, Lina Bo Bardi, organized in collaboration with the Johann Jacobs Museum in Zurich. He we also deliver a lecture on his book “Lina Bo Bardi” at the 4th Symposium of Museum Architecture at the University of Lisbon, Portugal. In addition, Lima traveled to Germany to help set up a video he produced for the exhibition Lina Bo Bardi, 100, on view November 13-February 22 at the Architekturmuseum at the Technische Universität München. Lima also delivered a November 14 lecture at the symposium that accompanied the launch of the exhibition catalogue. On December 11, Lima delivered a lecture in Paris on his book and presented “Lina Bo Bardi, curator,” the short pedagogical film he wrote and produced about the architect’s museological experience and thought-provoking proposals. Last, the curators of the Museum of Modern Architecture at MAXXI, Rome, recently interviewed associate professor Lima about “Lina Bo Bardi,” his biographic book on the Italian-Brazilian architect. The interview will be included in the museum’s exhibition about Bo Bardi’s Italian experience, along with a video documentary Lima prepared for the show, which is on view December 18-March 15.\n\n–\n\nRobert McCarter, the Ruth and Norman Moore Professor, discussed his new book on the work of Alvar Aalto in a lecture at the Saint Louis Art Museum. The Finnish architect and designer was one of the 20th-century’s most popular and accessible Modernist masters. A book signing will follow the lecture.\n\n–\n\nKelley Van Dyck Murphy and Lavender Tessmer, both lecturers in architecture, were among the winners of Sukkah City STL 2014: Between Absence and Presence. Presented by St. Louis Hillel and the Sam Fox School, the contemporary design competition challenged participants to reimagine the traditional Jewish sukkah through the lens of contemporary art and architecture. Ten cutting-edge sukkahs by architects and designers from around the nation were installed on campus.\n\n–\n\nSenior lecturer in architecture Pablo Moyano Fernández presented the abstract Self-sufficient Housing in St. Louis at the Housing Education Research Association conference. The abstract speculates about why and how the city of St. Louis lost an alarming part of its population and suggests possibilities for the future. The presentation showcases a selection of design studio projects that address emergent challenges for future generations of designers.\n\n–\n\nAssociate professor John Hoal, a founding partner of H3 Studio, is leading a team of local, national, and internationally known experts as finalists in a global design competition to improve river management and the rebuilding of the lower Mississippi River Delta. Titled Changing Course: Navigating the Future of the Lower Mississippi River Delta, the competition aims to halt land loss and restore the delta ecosystem while improving navigation and strengthening the resilience of local communities and industry. In addition to Hoal, WUSTL is represented with assistant professor Derek Hoeferlin, and several alumni serving on the H3 Studio design team, including project manager Matthew Bernstine (MUD14), as well as Laura Lyon (MArch00), Bryan Robinson (MArch04), Tim Breihan (MArch/MUD08), Courtney Cushard (MUD11), Colleen Xi Qiu (MArch/MUD12, MSAS13), and Junru Zheng (MLA14). In addition, Hoal sat down with a diverse panel of water experts and offered an important thought on “How we can reconstruct our neighborhoods, our cities, and our region to actually be water responsive, water-based cities” as part of Nine Network’s Stay Tuned.\n\n–\n\nVisiting assistant professors Ersela Kripa and Stephen Mueller collaborated with artist Wendy Mark on an installation that is featured in Mark’s exhibition Beginning with Square One. Cloudspace is a custom-fabricated spatial and optical device that interprets and expands Mark’s work. Kripa and Mueller designed, fabricated, and installed the project; their project team included MArch students Yu Xin and Bin Feng, who assisted with the digital design and production files. Other students assisted in the prototyping process in the School’s fabrication lab.\n\n–\n\nHUB: Hybrid Urban Bioscapes, a project led by assistant professor Catalina Freixas and senior lecturer Pablo Moyano, has been awarded a Neighbors Naturescaping grant. Their project aims to increase biodiversity in Old North St. Louis through the implementation of a rain garden and a nectaring garden. These small planting areas will allow the HUB team to register the project as part of the Milkweeds for Monarchs Initiative and help St. Louis reach its target of 200 new monarch gardens in 2014.\n\n–\n\nThe West End Neighborhood Sustainability Plan, produced by Master of Urban Design students, is the recipient of this year’s Outstanding Student Project Award from the Missouri Chapter of the American Planning Association. The plan was produced for the spring 2014 course Contemporary Practices of Sustainable Urbanism, taught by associate professor John Hoal, with Colleen Xi Qiu (MArch/MUD12, MSAS13) serving as a teaching assistant.\n\n–\n\nOver the past two decades, the rise of “material studies” has energized various disciplines by proposing objects as the very object of study, thereby opening up new and vital questions about many well-trodden topics. This two-day symposium explored how material culture and artistic production have helped generate political change from antiquity to the present. Several members of the Sam Fox School discussed their papers: Jesse Vogler, visiting assistant professor, Monika Weiss, associate professor, Sabine Eckmann, William T. Kemper Director and chief curator. In addition, Anna Vallye, postdoctoral research associate, moderated comments and discussion as the discussant for the panel on Spatialization.\n\n–\n\nIn 1974, more than 450 students, scholars, and practitioners from across the country came to Washington University to have courageous conversations about the status of women in architecture and allied fields. On November 7-9, the Sam Fox School marked the symposium’s 40th anniversary with Women in Architecture 1974 | 2014, a three-day event that celebrates the achievements of the last four decades but also underscores the need for continuing conversation–and action.\n\n–\n\nArt + the Brain: Stories and Structures explored the complex histories, practices, and interconnections between art, architecture, medicine, and neuroscience with the human brain as a central focus. Participants included the Sam Fox School’s Sung Ho Kim (associate professor of architecture), Ron Leax (Halsey C. Ives Professor of Art), and Patricia Olynyk (director of the Graduate School of Art); WUSTL Arts & Sciences professors Rebecca Messbarger, Kathy Miller, and Larry Snyder; and Mark Cohen and Jim Gimzewski, and was co-sponsored by UCLA’s Art | Sci Center and Lab, the Sam Fox School, and WUSTL’s Skandalaris Center for Entrepreneurial Studies.\n\n–\n\nThe O’Fallon Neighborhood Community Development and Design Program is one of 10 recipients of this year’s Outstanding Local Government Achievement Awards, presented by the East-West Gateway Council of Governments. The program is a collaboration between the Brown School’s Alliance for Building Capacity, Lou Colombo, the City of St. Louis, the O’Fallon Community Development Organization, and the North Newstead Association. As part of a fall 2012 course, visiting assistant professor Justin Scherma and Colombo led a team of students from both the Sam Fox School and the Brown School–including Alfredo Zertuche (MArch14), Binqi Luo (MArch15), Dustin Garness (BA11/MSW13)–in working with the community on housing and commercial center plans for the project. Neighborhood residents provided long-term vision statements, described desired outcomes, and prioritized strategies. The plans will be submitted for adoption by the City of St. Louis and provide a model for university-enabled neighborhood planning that is designed to give voice to disadvantaged citizens interested in working to improve their neighborhood.\n\n–\n\nThis fall, Downtown STL, Inc. and the Sam Fox School partnered to explore adaptive reuse possibilities for the Railway Exchange Building, working in cooperation with the owners of the iconic structure. At a December 10 reception and exhibition, students from Metamorphic Cities: Sustainable Strategies for Adaptive Reuse, a graduate architecture studio led by assistant professor Catalina Freixas, presented their responses to a call for innovative design ideas to reimagine the 21-story high-rise building, reinvigorate the surrounding area, and contribute to the continuing transformation of downtown St. Louis.\n\n–\n\nEric Mumford was appointed the Rebecca and John Voyles Professor of Architecture, Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts, and a Faculty Scholar, Institute for Public Health, at Washington University in St. Louis. He also recently published two peer-reviewed articles: Eric Mumford, “The Changing Forms of Metropolitan North America,” in Evelien van Es, et al. eds., CIAM 4 and comparative analysis (Bussum, the Netherlands: Thoth, 2014) and Eric Mumford, “Alvar Aalto’s Urban Planning and CIAM Urbanism,” Alvar Aalto-Second Nature (Weil-am-Rhein, Germany: Vitra Design Museum, 2014).\n\n–\n\nThe curators of the Bienal Internacional de Arquitectura de Argentina awarded the Montessori Children’s School project submitted by Raymond E. Maritz Professor Adrian Luchini “Distinguished” honors (the equivalent of second prize) in the Landscape and City category. The project, which features an addition to an existing facility in St. Louis, sought to “operate within those aesthetic canons that normally define the lack of concrete identity in all suburbia in the U.S., while trying to radically change the existing image of a building from the ’60s.”\n\nAndokope School K-8\n\nInitiated by Orphans’ Heroes (www.orphansheroes.org) , a New York-based charity, the Andokope School is a collaborative, design-build project involving faculty and students from Ryerson University’s Department of Architectural Science (www.arch.ryerson.ca), the Toronto office of the award-winning design firm, Arup (www.arup.com), and the Accra, Ghana-based architecture, engineering, and project management firm, Spatial Dimension.\n\nSituated on a relatively flat and treeless, one-and one-half-acre site located not far from the rural community of Andokope in the Volta region of eastern Ghana, the school project provides classrooms for some 300 students in grades K-8, as well as related amenities including a library, a sheltered lunch area that doubles as a performance space, various learning grounds, several hygienic, compost toilets, a clinic, and living accommodations for a half-dozen of the school’s teachers. Linked by a sheltering arcade, ten passively ventilated classrooms are arranged along the perimeter of a central courtyard. Envisioned to be “off the grid”, the facility features rainwater collection, groundwater recharging through percolation trenches, and solar heating for cooking purposes as well as for sterilizing utensils.\n\nAndokope School is intended to serve as a community anchor, one that is premised on providing a safe, accessible, and inclusive educational experience for children. The design seeks to address three major quality of life concerns for people living in the wider area: the lack of educational facilities, the problem of unsafe drinking water, and the difficulty of accessing medical care.\n\nBased on discussions with Orphans’ Heroes, the Ryerson team began by determining basic programmatic elements, using simple, colour-coded, scaled cut-outs to explore options for various functional and spatial layouts. Using this relatively straightforward technique, the team tested various layout options at a meeting with the client, who had traveled to Toronto from New York, as well as the project manager, who had traveled from Ghana. Ultimately, a preferred layout was arrived at, which was taken into schematic design and design development phases.\n\nDuring all phases of the work, the Ryerson team collaborated fully with Arup according to the Integrated Design Process (IDP) model, in which all aspects of the design, from conception to plan, to section, to materials, to structure, to passive design strategies and systems were explored. The IDP process enhanced the creativity of all members of the collaborative, ensuring that the design and design development process was one of refinement rather than re-conception.\n\nThe Ryerson team then produced a considerably more detailed design, which was forwarded to the Arup contingent for adjustment and ratification. Subsequently, Arup Toronto’s entire office was invited to attend a presentation of the work. Following this, the penultimate design was sent to the client for approval. Once accepted, the design was sent to the project manager in Ghana for costing. Finally, a set of presentation images was prepared by the Ryerson team’s lead designer to confirm the design’s architectural merit – the set was then forwarded to the client to help launch the charity’s fundraising campaign.\n\nThe Andokope School K-8 project is currently in the fundraising stage, with phased construction anticipated to commence later in 2014.\n\nFor more information about the Andokope School project, please visit:\n\nwww.orphansheroes.org/Orphans_Heroes/Ghana__Andokope.html\n\nThe Andokope School Team:\n\nOrphans’ Heroes\n\nJennifer Millett-Barrett, President\n\nArup Toronto\n\nJennifer McArthur\n\nPaul Paquet\n\nMalcolm Wallace\n\nAhmed Ghazi\n\nTaher Kamruddin\n\nEven Ma\n\nDejan Srbulovic\n\nRyerson University, Department of Architectural Science\n\nDr. Ian MacBurnie\n\nDavid Campbell, Design Team Coordinator and Lead Designer\n\nDesign Team Members:\n\nJames Heusser-Kowell\n\nSarah Ives\n\nDami Lee\n\nNicole Rutherford\n\nHelen (Yi-Fan) Xie\n\nKara Green\n\nCarrie Groskopf\n\nTricia Arabian\n\nAndrea Vettoretti\n\nSpatial Dimension\n\nAlbert Agbemenu\n\nEddie Yawson"
