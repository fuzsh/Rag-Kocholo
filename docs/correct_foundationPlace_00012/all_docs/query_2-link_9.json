        "text": "Drury University is committed to supporting our colleagues’ professional growth and development. Travel to conferences is one important element of that growth. The primary responsibility for the wise and appropriate selection of occasions for faculty travel falls to the individual faculty member and the department chair. Faculty are encouraged to present papers representing their scholarship at professional meetings, and they are encouraged to be in contact with professional organizations and associations representing their disciplines. Faculty are also encouraged to take an interest in professional associations which support the improvement of teaching and the general interests of higher education.\n\nThe University commits a significant amount of money for faculty travel. At the same time, the resources are limited, and it is the hope that money will be available for all those faculty who need to travel. It is for that reason that the following guidelines have been developed. It is only through a careful and judicious use of the faculty travel money that resources will be available for all of the faculty who wish to travel.\n\nAvailability of Funds: It will be the responsibility of the department chair to ascertain that sufficient funds are available before authorizing reimbursable travel expenses.\n\nApproval for Travel: No individual will be reimbursed for travel expenses unless she/he has obtained prior approval from the department chair to incur such expense and has submitted the proper request for reimbursement in good order. Requests for reimbursement should include a general summary of the expenses, rationale for any extraordinary expenses, and itemized receipts for all expenses.\n\nTravel Reimbursement for Expenses: The University has travel funds allocated to each faculty member in a department. These funds are for the purpose of providing assistance to faculty members who wish to attend professional meetings or travel on business of the University. The office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs can provide supplemental funds in special circumstances. The University is pleased to provide all or partial expenses for faculty travel, reimbursing appropriate items with complete itemized receipts. This includes cash and credit card expenses.\n\nIt is the general policy of the University to provide reimbursement for all reimbursable items when the faculty member is presenting a competitively selected paper at a professional conference in the United States. When a person is attending a conference, but not presenting a paper (including occasions when a person chairs a section but does not present a paper), the amount of reimbursement will depend upon the availability of funds. The University will provide as much support as possible for reimbursable items, but may not be able to provide full expenses. The faculty member should consult with the department chair regarding availability of departmental funds. Where departmental funds fall short in reimbursing a faculty member for travel to a conference where the faculty member is presenting a paper, the general University funds may provide a supplement to cover the expenses, and the department chair should apply to the Vice President for Academic Affairs for supplementary resources.\n\nFaculty may use an available University credit card for travel expenses, but complete itemized receipts are required. Faculty members are expected to pay their expenses or put them on credit cards and submit receipts upon return to the University. The University will make every effort to prepare reimbursement checks as soon as possible following the receipt of a request from the faculty member in the appropriate form and with the receipts attached. In very unusual circumstances, it may be possible for a faculty member to receive an advance on travel expenses. The need should be discussed with the department chair who will make the determination regarding whether or not to authorize the advance from departmental travel funds.\n\nInternational Travel: It is sometimes possible for the University to provide some assistance to faculty members for travel to international meetings. The University will be unable to reimburse those expenses fully, and the faculty member should consult with the department chair regarding the amount of funds that may be available. The department chair can seek supplementary assistance from the general University funds through the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.\n\nReimbursable Items\n\nTravel – Faculty members are expected to identify the most economical means of travel, taking into account the time involved. Ordinarily the University will reimburse for airline travel at the most inexpensive rate (normally coach). Tickets should be purchased early enough to benefit from 14-21 day advance purchase savings. Where staying over an extra day (often a Saturday night) will reduce the air fare significantly, the University will reimburse for hotel accommodations (assuming that the costs for hotel accommodations is significantly less than the savings in air fare). For faculty travel by private automobile, the current rate for reimbursement is $.41 per mile. Faculty should provide documentation reporting dates, destinations, and distance for the trip.\n\nTransfers – Expenses to and from the airport are reimbursed within reasonable limits. Faculty members are encouraged to use public transportation or airport shuttle services rather than cabs when they are available. While there will be occasions when a cab or more expensive transportation is necessary, it is important to select the less expensive transportation when at all possible.\n\nParking – For faculty who drive to a destination, parking expenses are reimbursable. For faculty who fly, parking at the Springfield airport is a reimbursable expense, but faculty are expected to park in the long-term lot.\n\nCar Rental – A car may be rented in situations where the cost is less than or equivalent to other means of transportation or when scheduled commitments require deviation from normal means of transportation. Prior approval from the department chair is required.\n\nHotel Accommodations – The University will cover hotel accommodations for the faculty member. The University does not cover hotel expense for companions or provide double accommodations unless it is two faculty members. Faculty members are expected to select the most reasonable accommodation available and convenient to conference location. Hotel accommodations will be covered only during the period of the meeting or conference unless, as previously mentioned, the faculty member stays over one extra night in order to save significant costs in air fare. An itemized statement furnished by the hotel is required for reimbursement of actual costs. Employees are encouraged to make advance registration and seek to secure available discounts.\n\nMeals – The University will reimburse expenses for meals for faculty members who have been approved for travel. In general, faculty are encouraged to keep their per diem expenses for meals at less than $50. Itemized receipts are required for reimbursement for meal expenses.\n\nTelephone Expenses – While faculty members are traveling, the University will cover telephone expenses directly related to University business.\n\nTips – Appropriate and modest tips are reimbursable.\n\nOther Expenses – While faculty will incur other expenses related to traveling, they are not normally\n\nreimbursable. Should there be an exceptional circumstance, faculty are encouraged to talk with the department chair for a judgment regarding whether or not a particular expense is reimbursable.\n\nIf there is a doubt about reimbursable expenses or travel policy, the faculty member should feel free to contact the department chair or Vice President for Academic Affairs."
