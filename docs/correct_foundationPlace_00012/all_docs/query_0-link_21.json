        "text": "Another successful Texas Dreamin' , saw some past colleagues of mine who I knew through only a screen. It was fun meeting all the new people and speaking yet again on marketing cloud. Jennifer P. and I had a lot fun. It was nice to finally meet Cliff Livingston in person after working together. It was also nice to see Joseph K. and Steve Hawthorne at this years Texas dreaming.\n\nThe solar eclipse was Monday and it was probably one of two big things that happened to me on that day. For those of you who don’t know, Monday was my last day at Slalom. To my colleagues and amazing co-workers, working with all of you on such unique and awesome projects left a lasting impact on me, from the welcoming personalities, to the strive to help me become a better consultant. Each and every person I met is someone who left an impression on me from the amazing discussions with where technology is going, to the work togetherness attitude where everyone presents the best ideas to put forward, and to the leadership who always pushed me forward in my goals into what I am wanting to become within my career. I thank everyone who I worked with, and the memories we crafted together and not to mention the change we made with what we did in our projects. It’s not good bye it’s see ya later."
