The project will empower students with practical skills through hands-on experimentation, investigating how varying conditions, such as temperatures, affect Li-ion battery performance, key battery parameters, and measuring and analysis under variable conditions. Students will learn prognostic models for Li-Ion Batteries by leveraging NASA’s extensive impedance dataset generated through temperature-variable charging and discharging experiments. These models hold promise in industries, aerospace, and renewable energy. The project unites theory and practice to advance knowledge and practical capabilities, making it invaluable in educational and industrial contexts.\n\nFaculty Research\n\nRasmani Hazra\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nAssessing the Role of a Novel Oncogenic lncRNA, LINC00461, in Glioma Progression\n\nRadiation-induced genetic alteration is associated with high-grade gliomas in both space and terrestrial environments. The unique environmental factors in space can differentially express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which play an important role in glioma progression. We will characterize a newly identified lncRNA, LINC00461, which is highly expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) compared to neural stem cells. We will assess how LINC00461 deletion affects GSC proliferation, migration, and stemness using various in vitro assays. Our findings will provide important insights into tumor progression and how lncRNAs, and LINC00461 in particular, could be exploited as a biomarker and /or therapeutic target.\n\nDan Liu\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nDevelopment of Interative Simulations of Human Body Integrating Augmented Reality\n\nWith Augmented Reality (AR) technology, the interactive simulations of the human body which we proposed to develop will provide in-time quantitative values of the forces on muscles and joints of different groups of people under various situations, including astronauts in space stations. The simulations function as an AR biomechanics analyzer will help the people be aware of the risk of injuries and give reference data for better gestures in body exercise. The simulations can also be implemented as a supplementary educational tool. Not only students majoring in Physical Therapy, Rehabilitation and Health Sciences will benefit from using it, but also students who are learning the concept of equilibrium in undergraduate interdisciplinary physics or biomechanics courses in general.\n\nChang Liu\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nQuantum Computation of Hydrodynamic Stability: From Aerospace to Convection in the Sun\n\nUnderstanding the transition to turbulence of flow around a transport vehicle and convection in the Sun are both computationally expensive due to associated extreme parameters. Recent developments of variational quantum eigensolver have demonstrated quantum speed-up in certain applications, but it is limited to Hermitian matrices, which prevents its direct application in hydrodynamic stability problems. This project aims to adapt existing variational quantum eigensolver to non-Hermitian matrices suitable for hydrodynamic stability problems and explore the potential speed-up of quantum computation in exploring extreme parameter regimes of flow motivated from aerospace and astrophysics applications.\n\nSarah Maurer\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nThe Role of Floating Islands on Ocean Worlds: Investigating Chemical Evolution in Vesicular Lava and Pumice\n\nPumice is a volcanic product that could serve as a surface for prebiotic chemistry on ocean worlds, including early Earth. We will model this novel environment by generating an organic mixture based off the composition of carbonaceous meteorites, and explore wet-dry cycles in the presence and absence of pumice. The products will be analyzed using LC-MS and functional assays be compared using principal component analysis, to demonstrate the role pumice can play in evolving chemical mixtures. This is directly relevant to understanding prebiotic evolution, and the abiotic background which is under the Exobiology program in the Science Mission Directorate.\n\nHashini Mohottala\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nDeltoid Muscle Force Simulation and Prototype Verification\n\nUnderstanding deltoid muscle mechanics is vital across human biomechanics, sports science, and rehabilitation. This STEM-driven study delves into the complexities of this pivotal muscle, essential for supporting shoulder stability and upper limb functionality. The primary objective of this inquiry is to help students enrolled in the Mechanics and Human Body course, mainly catering to students from majors in physical therapy and health sciences. This interdisciplinary pedagogical research intersects with NASA’s mission to promote STEM education.

Traditional landslide studies rely on labor-intensive visual interpretation of medium to high-resolution optical images, which can be subjective and time-consuming. In contrast, deep learning-based automated landslide segmentation streamlines this process, reducing the need for extensive human labor and expertise in feature extraction. This research aims to employ deep learning for comprehensive Mars landslide mapping, unveiling spatial patterns and process mechanisms. This project aligns with NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate objectives, emphasizing its relevance.\n\nTodd Ryder\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University\n\nMulticomponent Reactions of Ketone Substrates\n\nThe Petasis reaction is a multicomponent process that combines an organoboronic acid, a carbonyl compound, and an amine to generate densely functionalized products in high yields under mild conditions. It is widely believed that multicomponent processes like the Petasis reaction played an important role in the generation of organic building blocks such as amino acids from simpler precursors on prebiotic Earth. Interestingly, nearly all the examples reported in the literature to date have focused on aldehyde substrates. We are interested in extending the scope of this reaction to more challenging ketone substrates, such as 2-hydroxyacetophenone and pyruvic acid.\n\nDavid Shekhtman\n\nFairfield University\n\nParametric Study of (2+1)-Multiphoton Acetone Excitation for Nonintrusive Laser Diagnostics of High-speed Flow over Canonical Flight Geometries in Ground-Testing\n\nNonintrusive tagging diagnostics of high-speed flows in ground-test facilities are used for the pursuits of validating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes and developing new fluid models to describe transitional and turbulent flow regions. Acetone is a tracer, with (1) an easily accessible excitation spectrum and (2) signal enhancement due to oxygen (225-320 nm). The (2+1)-multiphoton excitation of acetone has yet to be explored within the context of molecular tagging for ground testing purposes. This proposal wishes to conduct a parametric study of the variables involved in the excitation process, so as to maximize signal. This will include variation in pressure, acetone seeding concentration, contaminant concentration (O2 and H2O), laser intensity, laser polarization, and secondary laser excitation. Two-laser thermometry will also be attempted. The PI of the proposal requests $10,000 from the CT NASA Consortium to cover the cost of supplies, one graduate student, and a stipend. The total budget is $20,800. Research will take place between Dec. 1-June 1, with initial preparations beginning on Nov. 1.\n\nMohammad Reza Vaziri Sereshk\n\nCentral CT State University\n\nExploring New Geometries for Improving Energy Absorption Mission of Lightweight Meta-Structures\n\nEnergy absorption capability of lattice structures benefits protective devices and packaging applications. Application of metallic lattices as the blast-absorber for military armor vehicles in the event of land-mine blast is the most recent one. However, these types of lightweight structures can be used in space mission as the impact-absorber in the event of crash of the space flying objects with the satellites or space station, as well as secure and safe landing of NASA capsule once it hits the ground. In this study, the current technologies for 3D-printing of delicate lattices from polymer are examined and 3D-printing manufacturability is discussed. Then, some innovative geometries are proposed for the structure to improve energy absorption of lattices. Particular attention will be devoted to plateau behavior of corresponding characteristic diagrams.\n\nSong Wang\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nAccelerated Construction and Rehabilitation Using Prefabricated Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) and Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Laminates\n\nIn the pursuit of developing human exploration systems and architectures for lunar and Martian missions, the proposed project delves into the potential of utilizing prefabricated ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) as innovative construction materials for space habitats, aligning seamlessly with NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (ESDMD) objectives. With a specific focus on repairing corroded steel beams, the project explores optimal construction methods employing prefabricated UHPC block and externally bonded FRP laminates. Extensive mechanical tests will be conducted on both undamaged steel beams and those rehabilitated using prefabricated UHPC and FRP, assessing the recovered strength and deformation capacity. By enhancing the structural integrity, durability, and safety of space infrastructures, this initiative directly addresses ESDMD’s concerns in the realm of human exploration system development.\n\nSumith Yesudasan Daisy\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nTesting Passive Radiative Cooling for Spacecraft Thermal Protection\n\nThis research, “Testing Passive Radiative Cooling for Spacecraft Thermal Protection,” explores passive daytime radiative cooling, aiming to enhance spacecraft thermal defense. Inspired by Earth-based cooling surfaces, the study adapts this technique for spacecraft facing extreme orbital temperatures. The experiment employs multilayered films of Vanadium dioxide, Silicon dioxide, and Silver. Using a specialized acrylic chamber, we will investigate Vanadium dioxide’s cooling efficiency. Unique methodologies involve suspending samples to reduce heat dissipation and using a vacuum for minimized convective and conductive losses. Integrated with advanced instrumentation, our findings align with NASA’s objectives, potentially transforming cooling strategies for future spacecraft.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Programming Grant\n\nBrianna Kirk\n\nCentral CT State University\n\nExploring the World to Ease the Mind: Studying the Impact of Science Education and Camping Experience on Science Anxiety Reduction\n\nNumerous research studies have examined math and science anxiety amongst college students. (See, for example, Ashcraft, 2002, Bryant et al., 2013, England et al, 2019, and Cooper et al., 2023.) The proposed project will have university faculty introduce incoming first-year students to science in an informal, collaborative, and non-academic overnight camp environment. Additionally, peer counselors with majors in the sciences will demystify science and address students’ concerns while creating a community of science learners. Pre and post-tests will demonstrate the utility of the approach for lessening first-year students’ anxiety and improving students’ attitudes and perceptions of the sciences.\n\nLin Lin\n\nMiddlesex Community College\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM GEMS CAMP 2024\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM GEMS Camp seeks to get children excited about learning by presenting opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math in creative and innovative ways. Campers learn about the marvels of science through scientific experiments, experience computer technology, learn the wonders of math, and the value of engineering. Each year we take children on expeditions around the City of Middletown to discover STEM GEMS (Great Educational Middletown Sites) and learn how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics impact our lives every day.

To support NASA’s mission directorates that aim to increase interest in STEM among students, this proposal aims to perform a research institute at Eastern Connecticut State University for high school students to increase awareness of STEM fields. Participant will 1) be encouraged to pursue STEM careers, 2) develop an awareness of STEM fields, and 3) learn how to use big data analytics in STEM fields.\n\nMeng-Ju Sher\n\nWesleyan University\n\nWesleyan Girls in Science Summer Camp\n\nFemale faculty members from Wesleyan’s natural science and mathematics, in partnership with Middletown Public Schools, run a one-week “Girls in Science Summer Camp” for underserved elementary school girls from Middletown, CT, and the surrounding communities. The camp is designed to reveal to 32 girls, 9-12 years old the science that surrounds them in their daily lives, while also exposing them to (1) scientific concepts and vocabulary, (2) equipment and experiments, and (3) female scientist role models, including both faculty and female Wesleyan science students. Campers explore scientific topics ranging from neural activity and renewable energy to biochemistry through hands-on activities and science-inspired art projects.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Research Grant\n\nCindy Thomas-Charles\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nActive Learning and Student-Driven Study Guides: Elevating Self-Efficacy and Metacognition in Biology Education for Tomorrow’s Space Scientists\n\nActive learning pedagogical strategies have been proven to effectively enhance student engagement, motivation, and performance. This study aims to demonstrate the potential of active learning and student-developed study guides in promoting student self-efficacy and metacognition. We will be using the Metacognition Awareness Inventory (1) to gather self-reported self-efficacy and metacognition data, which will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these strategies. Developing critical-thinking skills early on is essential and applicable not just within the classroom but beyond it as well. It is, therefore, imperative to improve metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy as this can contribute significantly to the development of a high-performing scientific workforce\n\nJacob Werblow\n\nCentral CT State University\n\nDeveloping an Evaluation tool to Measure STEM Best Practices through NASA Astro Camp Teacher Professional Development\n\nFor the past five years, the CT STEM Academy has provided teacher training as well as enrichment programs for historically underserved youth across central Connecticut. The NASA Astro Camp Teacher Certification is one such training, which gives classroom teachers and aspiring educators the chance to learn how to inspire youth to learn about space with NASA unique activities. Although over twenty CT educators have participated in the NASA Astro Camp, an external evaluation to measure the effectiveness of the Camp has not yet been conducted. This grant will allow us to conduct an external evaluation of the Camp pilot.\n\nFaculty Travel Grant\n\nAzmain Nisak\n\nWesleyan University\n\nTravel to the 243rd American Astronomical Society conference in New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nI am requesting funds to support travel to the 243rd American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting, the largest regularly held conference in the astronomical sciences worldwide and the largest gathering of local interstellar medium (LISM) experts.

The training extended for 3 days with a focus on systems and materials required to support crewed exploration vehicles and habitats. The ultimate product was a 3 day seminar that covered Vehicle Thermal Control and Crew Comfort (Day 1), Air Revitalization (Day 2), and Water Reclamation (Day 3). This project will provide an update to sections 1 and 2 (Thermal Control, Air Revitalization) of that training primer. Dr Tom Filburn will lead a team of two undergraduate researchers to enhance those topical sections of the 2007 primer.\n\nHaoyu Wang\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nRobotic Deburring and Blending of Aerospace Parts Based on 3D Vision and Differential Geometry\n\nThis project will contribute to NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. The goal of the research is to use differential geometric method and 3D vision in path planning and motion planning to improve current robotic deburring and blending of aerospace parts. The shape operator of a surface does not only provide the mean curvature of the surface (its trace), the Gauss curvature (its determinant), but also the radius of the circle that best fit the curve generated by intersecting the surfaces. The project will use properties of the shape operator to find an analytical formula/algorithm for deburring and blending.\n\nBrian Wells\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nThe University of Hartford Multiscale Metamaterial Undergraduate Student-Faculty Research Summer 2023\n\nThis research will be conducted with Professor Brian Wells at the University of Hartford Multiscale Metamaterial Research Laboratory, focusing on fabricating and characterizing multiscale metamaterial designs with a particular focus on application in satellite communication, astronomy, and astrophysics.

The available projects will include (1) investigating and developing multiscale metamaterial beam steering technologies for application in satellite communications and (2) designing and fabricating high-index 3D-Printed Metamaterial compact flat lenses for application in broad-band microwave imaging.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Programming Grant\n\nMarco Bonett-Matiz\n\nUniversity of Bridgeport\n\nSummer Math Preparation Workshop for Underrepresented STEM Students\n\nUB School of Engineering incoming freshmen typically place in MATH 103 Introduction to College Algebra or MATH 106 College Algebra (versus MATH 109 Pre-Calculus or MATH 110 Calculus). This generally positions the student at least a year behind in their engineering courses leading to a longer timeframe to graduation, education costs and often retention loss. A virtual math-focused summer preparation workshop with an on-campus residential component will be conducted to support 25 incoming underrepresented freshmen STEM students with on campus accommodation for up to four students. The project aligns with all mission directorates, but most closely the Science Mission Directorate.\n\nPhilip Gee\n\nNorwalk Community College\n\nNorwalk STEM Science Fair\n\nHold a STEM Fair at Norwalk Community College.

We aim to do this by developing online tutorials that use computer simulations students can manipulate and explore on screen to help them learn about the behavior and relationships between electric and magnetic fields. Preliminary data suggests this approach can benefit all students, but especially women, with weaker spatial reasoning skills more than tutorials without simulations. As we pilot additional tutorials, we expect to learn more about the factors that impact how students learn physics.\n\nFaculty Project Grant\n\nMihai Duduta\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nDielectric Elastomer Actuators as Solid State Grippers for Space Application\n\nSoft robots offer new solutions for longstanding challenges in Robotics, particularly operation in unstructured environments. The proposed research aims to develop and evaluate soft robotic grippers based on dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs). Operating as completely solid state devices, DEA grippers can provide the operator rich information on gripping parameters through embedded proprioception. The project will support a student in demonstrating a four digit gripper that can be deployed from a confined space, and withstand low pressure and damaging radiation, in a controlled laboratory environment.\n\nFaculty Research Grant\n\nDanushka Bandara\n\nFairfield University\n\nMemory Retrieval Under Stress\n\nThis project aims to explore the effect of stress on memory retrieval in simulated virtual environments. Since astronauts face high-risk situations such as extravehicular activities, they are constantly exposed to stress, affecting their memory retrieval. This project will quantify the effect of stress on memory retrieval in simulated 3D environments and the effect of various factors on memory retrieval (timing of stress, sensory modality, and emotion). This interdisciplinary project will move the study of memory forward as well as train students on human subject experiments and analysis of physiological data. This project supports NASA space operations mission directorate’s human research program and NASA Exploration systems development mission directorate’s Extravehicular (xEVA) and Human Surface Mobility program.\n\nDjedjiga Belfadel\n\nFairfield University\n\nAutonomous Drone Swarm Navigation in a GPS denied Environment\n\nThis project aims to provide an alternative navigation system to enable a swarm of drones to conduct autonomous missions in a Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environment. To achieve this goal, we propose a relative navigation system, using an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse the observation from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and the range sensor. This methodology uses two waveforms to achieve a secure and high communication data rate using a low-cost beam-switching phased array. This system thus enables drone operations even in GPS- denied environments. This cost-effective solution aligns with NASA’s Space Technology strategic enterprise.\n\nChandranil Charkraborttii\n\nTrinity College\n\nAnalyzing Anomalies from Solar Observations to Detect, Predict and Interpret New and Existing Solar Phenomena\n\nThis research will analyze observations from multiple NASA’s solar observatory missions to find, explain and predict anomalies in solar observations. Leveraging the time series nature of data, we will use unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect anomalies. Using cluster analysis techniques, the flagged anomalies will be correlated with existing phenomena for future prediction of these events and to find new potential solar phenomena. Automated interpretation will be performed to generate reasons why the model flagged certain observations as anomalies. The project will promote scientific understanding of solar effects on Earth and the interplanetary environment in accordance with Science Mission Directorate.\n\nKehan Gao\n\nEastern Connecticut State University\n\nExploring the Potential of Deep Learning for Mars Image Classification and Analysis\n\nDeep Learning (DL), which uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn and process information, has achieved breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, including image recognition. In this project, we will apply three DL convolution neural network models to classify two NASA image datasets: MSLNet and HiRISENet, featuring Mars surface and Mars orbital images, respectively. Undergraduate students participating in the project will gain valuable research experience in the fascinating field of Mars image classification. By applying state-of-the-art image classification approaches, the project aims to produce valuable research outcomes that will be published and shared with data science classes.\n\nYuriy Garbovskiy\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nControlling Ions in Advanced Liquid Crystal Materials Tailored to Space Applications\n\nElectrically driven liquid crystals have the potential to revolutionize existing and emerging technologies critical to space exploration, space imaging, space communication, and space navigation. Because the electric field induced effects can be altered by ions typically present in liquid crystal in minute quantities, the control over ions in liquid crystal materials is essential for the development of advanced space applications. This project related to NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate and Science Mission Directorate focuses on the development of new approaches to control ions in liquid crystals by utilizing ion-capturing and ion-releasing nanomaterials and thin films.\n\nHuan Gu\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nEvaluating the Impact of Microgravity on the Virulence and Antibiotic Susceptibility of Staphylococcus Aureus\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen and part of astronauts’ skin microbiome that constantly mutates in response to environmental changes. The extreme gravitational forces (g-forces) during space traveling could alter S. aureus’s activities and astronauts’ skin such as thinning, providing opportunities for multi-antibiotic resistant skin infections. However, how the change in g-forces affects S. aureus’s activities, specifically, virulence and antibiotic susceptibility, remains unknown. In this project, we developed a new method to rigorously control g-force and evaluate its effects on S. aureus’s activities, enabling the development of effective strategies to prevent and treat mediated infections during space traveling.\n\nShivanjali Khare\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nChannel Anomaly Prediction with Multi-granularity Fusion and GRUs\n\nThis proposal presents an approach for improving anomaly prediction in large telemetry datasets generated by NASA missions. The proposed method combines a multi-granularity encoder-decoder-based fusion network with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based anomaly prediction model to identify complex spatiotemporal patterns, correlate anomalies across different channels and granularities, and reduce false positives. The resulting approach aims to minimize the risks associated with spacecraft operations and increase mission success. This research is significant to NASA’s mission directorates as it provides an innovative and effective way to improve anomaly detection and reduce false positives, thereby enhancing mission safety, reliability, and efficiency.\n\nAnna Kloc\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nEpigenetic Analysis of Chromatin Modifications in Human Heart Tissues Affected by Epstein-Barr Virus\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, is a condition most often associated with a viral infection. Such inflammation can have devastating consequences on cardiac function, yet it can be challenging to diagnose due to a wide range of clinical manifestations. Epstein-Barr virus is often reactivated in astronauts during space travels, and it has also been implicated in heart disease. However, despite the association between viral infection and heart disease, the molecular networks that guide disease progression and outcomes are not fully understood. This research project will elucidate how viral infection in the heart is regulated on an epigenetic level, with emphasis on histone modifications. This analysis will contribute to a better understanding of cardiac disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus induced pathology.\n\nYingcui Li\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nNovel Method to Study Bone Loss Cellular Mechanism Using Computer Controlled Image Analysis from High-Throughput, Multi-Image Cryohistology on Growth Plates\n\nDuring space missions lasting six months or longer, astronauts can experience bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging. and they only recovered about half of that loss after one year back on Earth. This bone loss may not completely be recovered even years after returned to earth (1). Bone loss would cause bones to become brittle and likely to fracture (break), resulting in osteoporosis, or weak bones. Bone loss therefore poses a great danger to astronauts’ health and their ability to carry out basic functions during space travel and after returning to earth and it is a significant and unresolved health risk.\n\nOur bodies have a natural cycle for removing old bone cells and rebuilding new bone cells. The balance of bone formation and bone turnover (bone loss) needs to be maintained so that bone structure and density are stable. Bone undergoes continuous cycles of modeling and remodeling (2, 3). With advancing age, at the cellular level, the amount of bone resorbed by osteoclasts (bone removing cells) is not fully restored with bone deposited by osteoblasts (bone forming cells) and this imbalance leads to net bone loss. Thus, aging and osteoporosis are intimately linked. After age 50, human start losing bone faster than our body can build it. In fact, due to this accelerated process of bone loss, women can lose up to 20% of their bone density within 5 to 7 years following menopause (4). Many other risk factors have been linked to bone loss such as diet lacking calcium, family history of osteoporosis, limited mobility, and long-term space travel under low or micro gravity (4, 5).\n\nThe underlying molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis are believed to be the increased activity of osteoclasts, decreased activity of osteoblasts, or a combination of both, which lead to an imbalance in the bone remodeling process with accelerated bone resorption and attenuated bone formation. There is an urgent need to fill the gap of a direct measurement of the rate of bone formation and turnover to understand the cellular mechanism of this process. In this study a novel method is developed using laboratory mice and in vivo vital mineral injections to a) measure the rate of bone formation b) measure the rate of bone turnover c) identify cell types in order to detect anomalies during this process. Using computer-controlled image analysis quantitative study of bone formation and turnover process at the cellular level can be achieved for the first time. This is significant because with the result of this study we will learn for the first time the detailed cellular mechanism of bone loss, and this may provide valuable insight into new preventive and treatment methods to this condition.\n\nSolaleh Miar\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nInterdisciplinary Student Engagements in the Development of a Novel Preventive Approach with the Potential to Mitigate Space-Induced Muscle Atrophy\n\nMuscle atrophy in astronauts is a life-threatening condition during spaceflights. In this proposal, we aim to design a modulated drug delivery system to provide biochemical and electrical cues to eliminate muscle loss and promote muscle function. This novel research focuses on the development of an electrosensitive drug delivery system capable of releasing Myostatin Inhibitors (chemical cue) paired with external stimulation to prevent muscle atrophy with the application of muscle loss prevention in astronauts. To evaluate the efficiency of the designed system, the impact of the combination of chemical and electrical stimuli on muscle volume and function will be studied in-vitro.\n\nCameron Oden\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nDegradation of PPCPs Using Metal Oxides Native to Martian Soil\n\nAccess to clean water is a challenge for NASA’s space exploration missions. Current technologies rely on membrane filtration and adsorbents to generate potable water. Planetary exploration missions, however, will require water treatment technologies that are not dependent on consumables. The Martian surface has an abundance of metal oxides, including iron, manganese, and titanium oxides, that could potentially be used to degrade water contaminants. The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the use of metal oxides native to the Martian surface for the photocatalytic and thermocatalytic degradation of aqueous contaminants resulting from pharmaceuticals and personal care products.\n\nHao Sun\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nDesign of NIR-Induced Self-Healing Polymer/Polydopamine Composite Materials with Radiation Resistance\n\nSelf-healing polymer materials that can autonomously repair their physical damages are highly desired for various applications in biomedical devices, electronics, and aerospace. However, the lifetime of self-healing polymers would be significantly compromised by high frequency ionizing radiation such as gamma and X-rays. In the proposed research, we aim to develop polymer/polydopamine nanocomposite-based self-healing materials which not only can repair themselves, but also resist ionizing radiation. We envision that this study will present the next-generation polymer materials for NASA’s space-related applications by constructing self-healing spacecrafts, and protecting astronauts from cosmic radiation during the space exploration.\n\nSriharsha Sundarram\n\nFairfield University\n\nInnovative Thermal Protection Systems for Space Vehicles based on Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) Polymer Nanocomposite Structures\n\nThe goal of this project is to explore innovative ablative thermal protection systems for space vehicles through the fabrication of flexible polymer nanocomposites with triply periodic minimal surface architectures. A fabrication approach using 3D printing is employed to manufacture custom designed lightweight conformal structures that serve not only as thermal protection system but also offer load bearing capabilities. The thermal and mechanical properties of these structures will be characterized. This project ties in directly with the Space Operations Mission Directorate which has identified conformal ablative thermal protection systems as one of the technology area relevant to the agency’s mission.\n\nFaculty Research Grant\n\nPierre Christian\n\nFairfield University Black Holes in Virtual Reality\n\nThis project proposes to create a virtual reality (VR) environment that mimics real life black holes with computer simulations. The VR environment will accurately simulate the trajectories of objects hurled towards the black hole, and will be directly controlled with VR motion controls. The resulting VR environment will not only be beneficial for pedagogical purposes, but also be accurate enough to be utilized for professional black hole research. By removing the barrier of entry for researchers to utilize black hole numerical simulation codes in their research, this project is relevant to the Astrophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.\n\nOmar Faruk Emon\n\nUniversity of New Haven 3D Printing of Functional Polymers for Sensing Applications\n\nAdditive manufacturing could be employed to realize need-specific electronics. The goal of this project is to develop a 3D printing solution (system and materials) for fabricating polymer-based flexible sensors. The standard sensors come with predefined geometries, mechanical properties, and sensitive ranges. Commercial 3D printers generally do not support functional polymers for electronics and, more importantly, customization in materials to vary the specifications. This research will provide a pathway to “make what is needed” instead of “work with what is available”. Therefore, it is believed to be crucial for NASA’s space-related applications by enabling on-demand fabrication, adjustment, and repair of electronics.\n\nScott Graves\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University Osprey’s view of a Curious Natural Perched Beach, Guilford, CT – µUAS Aerial Mapping\n\nThe “Osprey’s view of a Curious Natural Perched Beach” project combines low altitude small Unmanned Aerial Systems (μUAS) mapping with traditional on-ground Transit Surveys to produce high-resolution geo-referenced orthomosaic image/maps and 3D landform visualizations of an important, yet previously unexplained, natural perched beach in a suburban setting that appears to be in continual landward migration driven by storm surge over wash events. The project activities are in line with NASA’s strategic goals including use of Remote Sensing and Earth Observations to enhance our understanding of the environment while providing information that helps in planning and stewardship of the coastal environment.\n\nNaser Haghbin\n\nFairfield University Developing a Human Blood Vessel using 3D Bioprinting and Cell Culturing techniques\n\n3D bioprinting technology will have an essential role in the future of NASA space missions to print human tissues for the health of astronauts. This research will design and fabricate a blood vessel that produces a volumetric flow rate. We develop a 3D CAD model in a cylinder, which acts as a mold. Then, the bioink and cells mixture is 3D printed inside the cylinder mold and a spherical mold. We will then use microscopy to examine the growth of cells in the blood vessel’s muscular and vascular layer.\n\nKristine Horvat\n\nUniversity of New Haven Exploring Oxygen and Fuel Options for Mars Using Different Algae Growth Conditions\n\nMars exploration is necessary to determine its hospitality to human living. As a result, many challenges must be overcome, including determining ways to produce oxygen and fuel, which are important to the Space Technology Mission Directorate. In this study, Chlorella algae will be grown under different pressure, temperature, and gas-phase composition conditions. The monitoring of the gas-phase composition and algae volume over time will help determine the oxygen production rate, algae growth rate, and ability to produce oil under varying conditions. Results will provide evidence to the feasibility of growing Chlorella on Mars as an oxygen and fuel source.\n\nGoli Nossoni\n\nUniversity of New Haven Moonglomerete for Construction on the Moon\n\nIn the past years, most researches in NASA and elsewhere focused on making a type of geopolymer concrete for moon construction with a different binder than cement paste due to the lack of water and cement on the moon. The goal was that the new concrete should be placed using the new technology of 3D printing. However, researchers are still trying to discover a feasible binder. Even a small amount of binder transported from earth may costs millions of dollars. Since the focus was on finding this binder, researchers tried to implement the proposed solution of 3D printing some sort of non-hydraulic Portland cement concrete rather than addressing the basic problem statement. The problem statement is “construction materials on the moon with integrous material with minimum transportation from earth.” The proposed research plans to construct bricks from moon materials and energy generated on the moon with no need of any materials from earth. Instead of being 3D printed, the bricks will be made using a robotic manufacturing process. The new material uses for manufacturing bricks is called Moonglomerete, which solely uses rocks already present on the moon. Although the proposed material is very different than concrete, it still can be classified a sort of “mooncrete” where larger lighter colored moon rocks (anorthosite) will be embedded in a binder made from smaller darker rocks (basalt) that are molten to form bricks. The structure of these bricks are compatible with conglomerate rocks on earth. Basalt has a lower melting point than anorthosite. The energy required to melt dust particles of basalt will be supplied using relatively small Fresnel lenses. The temperature at the focal points of the lenses can reach more then 2000°C on the earth, which can melt most rocks in less than a minute.\n\nRahul Singhal\n\nCentral Connecticut State University Synthesis and characterization of MnCuO and rGO/MnCuO materials for supercapacitor applications.\n\nWe will synthesize and characterize the materials for supercapacitors to store high specific energy. The proposed work is related to NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). We will synthesize MnCuO and rGO/MnCuO by hydrothermal method at various temperature. The synthesized materials will then be physically characterized using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, rate performances, and cycleability will be carried out in a three electrode system using the electrodes of the synthesized materials, Pt. foil, Ag/AgCl as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively.\n\nQian Yang\n\nUniversity of Connecticut Predicting Melting Point of Eutectic Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks\n\nMolten salt mixtures are promising candidates for use as electrolytes in new battery technologies, with applications ranging from space vehicles in harsh environments such as Venus to electric-powered aircraft. Prediction of the eutectic melting points for these materials is a key technical challenge. We propose utilizing graph neural networks to train data-driven models for prediction of eutectic melting temperatures. We will curate a benchmark dataset by combining a large database of molten salt eutectics with structural and other feature information. A fast machine learning model would pave the way for future high-throughput screening of eutectic mixtures for battery design.\n\nGuoan Zheng\n\nUniversity of Connecticut Miniaturized optofluidic ptychography for terrestrial and astrobiological research\n\nWe aim to develop a miniaturized optofluidic ptychography platform for the search of micron-size organisms and crystals in perennial springs in Peyto Lake in Banff National Park. The remarkable simplicity of the proposed device allows the construction of high-resolution microscopes that can detect and capture the behavior of microscopic organisms and microparticles in difficult terrestrial environments. The possibility for designs that have low weight and that can survive vibrations and shocks encountered during rocket launch as well as landing on a destination moon or planet makes the proposed device a particularly strong candidate for space mission and astrobiological studies.\n\nFaculty Project Grant\n\nBarbara Murdoch\n\nEastern Connecticut State University Publishing undergraduate research in peer-reviewed journals\n\nThis project seeks to fund the cost of publishing two research manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals, each the result of undergraduate research and previously funded by research grants from the Connecticut Space Grant Consortium. Publication of our novel results will disseminate our findings to national and international audiences and demonstrate the exceptional research capacity of undergraduate researchers. Our research explores the diversity and antibiotic production of the scorpion microbiome and has implications for NASA’s directorate of Human Exploration, that requires having the knowledge of microbial diversity and antibiotic arsenal required to eradicate bacterial infections, in space and on earth.\n\nFaculty STEM Ed Programming\n\nDonna Hylton\n\nMiddlesex Community College Adventures in Learning STEM GEMS Camp\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM Camp seeks to get children excited about learning by presenting opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math in creative and innovative ways. Campers learn about the marvels of science through scientific experiments, experience computer technology, learn the wonders of math, and the value of engineering. This year our camp will once again take on our newly adopted format. We will take children on expeditions around the City of Middletown to discover STEM GEMS (Great Educational Middletown Sites) and learn how science, technology, engineering, and mathematics impact our lives every day. After spending years behind a screen in virtual classes, the children will enjoy time outdoor and visiting STEM locations.\n\nFaculty STEM Ed Research\n\nJohn Drazan Fairfield University Expanding Access to Informal STEM Enrichment Through Sports\n\nWe seek to evaluate the efficacy of using sports as a venue for informal STEM enrichment among underrepresented youth. We will host a one-week summer research experience at Fairfield University for 16 high school students. There will be two parallel programs, one focused on traditional engineering research and one focused biomechanics in sports. We will compare the demographics, starting STEM interest, and ending STEM interest of participants in both programs. We hypothesize that sports biomechanics research will engage a more diverse set of students with lower starting STEM interest relative to the traditional engineering research program.\n\nFaculty-Student Summer Research\n\nHaoyu Wang\n\nCentral Connecticut State University In-Space Robotic Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing through Robotic Teleoperation and Just-In-Time Data\n\nThis research will contribute to NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. The goal of the research is to develop an intelligent remote-control system for robots to conduct in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing operations using virtual reality and augmented reality to get control commands from the user and allow the user to visualize just-in-time data analytic and real-time video feed of the operation site. Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IOT) will be used to acquire, store, and process the data from multiple sensors at the operation site. Deep learning will be used to build AI models for intelligent human-robot interfaces.\n\nHigh Altitude Ballooning/Cubesat (HAB/C)\n\nChong Qiu\n\nUniversity of New Haven High-altitude Ballooning with Portable Ozone Monitors in Preparation for Stratospheric Ozone Measurements during the 2023 Solar Eclipse\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of engineering seniors will select a portable ozone monitor for both ground and stratospheric ozone monitoring. The team will build a proper housing for the ground ozone measurements. The team will also build necessary power and data transmission accessories for the ozone monitor in order to assemble a complete payload of a high-altitude balloon for stratospheric ozone measurements. The engineering solutions in this project will be used for stratospheric ozone measurements during the 2023 solar eclipse. The project’s objectives are well-aligned with the atmospheric science and planetary science missions of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.\n\nFaculty Research Grants\n\nSahar Al Seesi\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University Gene Allele-Specific Expression (ASE) Estimation from Bulk and Single Cell RNA-Seq Data\n\nGene allele specific expression estimation is an interesting computational biology problem that answers the question of whether the paternal, the maternal, or both copies of an inherited gene are expressed (active) in a your body. This question is asked by many biologists, but the computational methods to address it are still not good enough to accurately give an answer. In this research project, we propose computational solution to address this problem using transcriptomic sequencing data. The project aligns with the mission of NASA’s gene lab, under the Human Exploration Mission Directorate, which focuses with mutli-omics (including transcriptomic) data-driven research.\n\nAli Bazzi\n\nUniversity of Connecticut High-availability Energy Systems for Space Colonies\n\nSpace colonies have recently become of higher interest recently to explore new resources away from Earth. The main goal of this project is to significantly increase the availability of electrical energy systems in future space colonies during unexpected failures or events, thus enhancing the energy security of such colonies. The proposed research provides a framework and specific solutions where prediction, diagnostic, and fault-recovery methods, combined with enhanced microgrid architectures, will enable a more secure electrical energy supply for future space colonies. Future colonies will require a reliable and available power supply for many critical systems. Transformative approaches proposed here can provide relevant solutions. These include rapid fault prediction and diagnosis of system- and component-level faults in a colony’s electrical energy system, which is to be treated as an islanded microgrid; and utilization of unused power distribution and conversion capacity in available infrastructure to maximize the system’s available energy under faults and uncertain events.\n\nRuth Blake\n\nYale University Extreme PO4 Biosignatures: Testing the Thermal Limits of the δ18O-PO4 Biomarker at Hydrothermal Conditions\n\nThe PO4 oxygen-isotope composition of DNA from biomolecules/biomass can serve as an internal thermometer and biosignature to study in-situ habitats of microorganisms from unknown and remote sources on Earth and on ocean-bearing worlds in our solar system. However, an offset in δ18O fractionations was observed for (hyper)thermophiles, at temperatures greater than 70°C, making the application of DNA thermometry problematic for extreme hydrothermal conditions. To fully understand the mechanism of fractionation of internal PO4 pools, we propose to test the hypothesis that the offset is due to intracellular fractionation caused by production of PO4-rich compatible solutes that are enriched in δ18O.\n\nDana Casetti\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University Point Spread Function Modelling of WFPC2/HST Images with Deep Learning\n\nThis project will explore a novel way of achieving high-precision astrometry using deep learning techniques. We will work with WFPC2/HST images which are severely undersampled. The astrometric precision of these images is limited as a ”pixel-phase” bias is present even in the best, state-of-the art classical centering algorithms. We have identified an ideal and unique data set in the WFPC2 archive to explore and implement this deep-learning technique. The project has great synergy with existing research at SCSU and at Space Telescope Science Institute, and it involves two science departments at SCSU.\n\nByungik Chang\n\nUniversity of New Haven Analysis of Energy Saving Wind Tower Erection on Mars\n\nThe main source of energy on Mars exploration missions is solar panels. However, the prevalence of dust on Mars limits their generation capabilities by blocking the solar cells thereby hindering their access to the sunlight. Surface winds on Mars typically move about 16 to 32 km/h. Thus, a wind energy could be another way to generate energy on Mars when humans arrive but it requires frequent maintenance and protection (take-down) because unpredictable weather. The primary goal of the research is proposing and analyzing alternative wind turbine erections and minimizing energy consumption in wind tower erection on Mars.\n\nEric Dieckman\n\nUniversity of New Haven Ultrasonic Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) of Additively Manufactured Metals (AMMs)\n\nAdditively manufactured materials (AMM) provide the ability to create complex parts without machining. These parts are difficult to inspect, primarily due to geometry and anisotropic/heterogeneous material properties. Detecting and classifying flaws in AMM is vital to their use in safety-critical applications, such as NASA’s spaceflight missions. NASA is developing AMM parts ranging from engines to antennas, which cannot be easily inspected – current inspection techniques are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to apply outside a lab. Use of common ultrasonic testing equipment adapted to AMM can provide a way to leverage existing technology in the nascent field of AMM testing.\n\nReihaneh Jamshidi\n\nUniversity of Hartford Thermal and Mechanical Analysis of 3D-printed Structures for Space Applications\n\n3D-printing facilitates creation of more complex geometries using less amounts of materials and manufacturing steps in comparison with conventional manufacturing techniques. This enables component design and fabrication of space systems with less production time and cost, and environmental impacts. The challenge however, is qualification and verification of 3D-ptinted materials for space applications, as the extreme space environment imposes stringent requirements. The proposed study will investigate the effect of thermal cycling in space, on the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed parts. Thermal cycling can produce stress in structures, which contributes to mechanical defects and failure. This is extremely important for study of 3D-printed materials for space applications, as these structures are built layer upon layer, and stress can initiate delamination and breakage at the interface between the layers.\n\nDerek Laux\n\nEastern Connecticut State University Examining the Effects of Microgravity and Space Radiation on Cellular Senescence\n\nSpace travel exposes the human body to unique threats. Microgravity and cosmic radiation can both contribute to physiological health risks, including cardiovascular changes, muscle atrophy, and bone density loss. Astronauts show elevated levels of senescence, which seems to provide a molecular explanation for many of the health problems related to space travel. How microgravity and radiation induce senescence and components of these cells that may contribute to disease remain unknown. This study will address NASA’s goal of understanding biological responses to spaceflight by examining how microgravity and radiation induce cellular senescence and by examining molecular targets to alleviate age-related dysfunction.\n\nSeok-Woo Lee\n\nUniversity of Connecticut Development of Small-Scale Cryogenic Linear Actuator by Using Novel Intermetallic Compounds\n\nSpace missions often involve ultra-cold environments, and cryogenic actuators must be mechanically robust for long-term cyclic work, generate high power, as well as perform high precision motion in such extreme environments. Recently, we discovered a novel intermetallic compound CaFe2As2 that meets these demanding requirements. In this project, therefore, a new type of cryogenic linear actuator will be developed by performing the combined set of works that include the evaluation of cryogenic linear actuation performance, understanding of physics behind cryogenic actuation properties, and the development of proto-type linear actuators that operates at a temperature between 4 and 150 K.\n\nRobert Nazarian\n\nFairfield University Increased Heat Stress in a Changing Climate\n\nIn a warming climate, changes in heat stress more significantly impact human health than the increase in temperature alone; some studies go so far as to suggest that the tropics may not be habitable due to extreme heat stress. Our goal is to use an ensemble of high-resolution climate models to calculate the change in heat stress over the northeast US through 2100, focusing on the compounding effects of increasing temperature and relative humidity. This study supports NASA’s training and research missions by advancing our understanding of our changing climate and providing undergraduate students with a robust research experience.\n\nAaron Van Dyke\n\nFairfield University Examining Sex Differences in Brain and Behavior After Long-Term Social Isolation Using Rats\n\nThe psychological and biochemical effects of living in confined conditions for prolonged periods that are typical of orbital and deep-space missions have not been fully explored. This collaborative project will examine sex-specific effects of social isolation on locomotor, anxiety, social, and cognitive behaviors using rats. Adolescent male and female rats will be confined to social isolation (1 per cage) or small groups (2-4 per cage) for 5 weeks before behaviors are assessed. Subsequently, protein markers for decision making and memory will be quantified using Western blotting. This interdisciplinary project will train undergraduate students in behavioral and biochemical techniques.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Programming\n\nRuth Blake\n\nYale University FemLED STEAM: Young Inner-city Females Lead, Envision, and Develop for STEM\n\nThere is a shortage of Inner-city students exposed to Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In supporting NASA’s mission directorates that seeks to inspire the pursuit of careers in STEM within traditionally unrepresented groups, the proposal’s goal is to develop a STEM workshop for inner-city females focused on STEM career development, STEM women of color history, STEM appreciation role-playing, and STEM product-creation. Participants will 1) have the confidence to pursue STEM careers, 2) advocate for peers with STEM interest, 3) develop a greater awareness of diverse STEM fields, and 4) appreciate the mentoring and cross-cultural experience with university STEM students.\n\nFaculty-Student Summer Research Grants\n\nHaoyu Wang\n\nCentral Connecticut State University Robotic Intelligent Grasping for Unknown Objects Using Vision, Force Sensing, and Deep Learning\n\nThis research will contribute to NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. The goal of the research is to develop a robotic intelligent grasping system using vision, force sensing, and deep learning. The system can be mounted on a vehicle on another planet to help on tasks such as retrieving samples or conducting repair or maintenance jobs. Two undergraduate students will design and prototype an error tolerant gripper and integrate it and a deep learning computer to an ABB IRB 1200 robot with integrated force control and vision. They will also develop system software for vision, force control, and deep learning\n\nCy Yavuzturk\n\nUniversity of Hartford Transport and Flow Characteristics of Graphene-Doped Nanofluids in Double-Pipe Heat Exchangers\n\nThe objective of the proposed study is the experimental/analytical assessment of heat transfer and flow characteristics of graphene-doped nanofluids in concentric tube heat exchangers. A double-pipe system will be configured such that graphene-doped primary fluid of varying graphene volume fractions flows in the inner tube while a secondary flow of deionized water counter-flows in the annulus. The controlled changes of thermal properties will allow for the assessment of nanofluid heat transfer characteristics. The study results have implications in the characterization of heat transfer phenomena using graphene-based nanofluids in cooling applications for operation of aeronautical vehicles and related subsystems.\n\nFaculty Research\n\nLeslie Frame\n\nUniversity of ConnecticutDevelopment and Characterization of Extraterrestrial Soils for Local Vehicle Test Beds\n\nThe United States has existing plans to return to the Moon, send manned missions to Mars and unmanned missions to Venus. Lesley Frame (UConn, Assistant Professor in MSE) and Jani Macari Pallis (UB, Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering) will collaborate to create regolith/soil simulants for two small realistic test beds which will emulate Lunar, Martian, and Venusian landscapes. The proposed research and resulting test beds will be used by both UConn and UB to attract students into STEM capacity building opportunities, including participation in NASA challenges and research related to exploration, transportation and housing on these extraterrestrial surfaces.\n\nAnna KlocUniversity of New Haven Evaluating the impact of human herpesvirus infection on heart function\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The heart can be infected by viruses, which may lead to an inflammatory, and potentially life-threatening, condition known as myocarditis. Human herpesviruses, often reactivated in astronauts during space travels, have been implicated in heart disease. The goal of this research project is to analyze the genomic sequences of herpesviruses found in human cardiac samples, and characterize the expression patterns of inflammatory markers associated with heart disease. These analyses will lead to a better understanding of herpesvirus-induced heart pathology, and help develop diagnostic tools that assess cardiac disease progression.\n\nRobert O’Brien\n\nUniversity of New Haven The Impact of Thermal Variations of Connecticut Salt Marshes on Associated Marine Wildlife as Detected Using Remote Sensing.\n\nAs a result of climate change, sea levels are rising around the globe threatening the ecological role of coastal salt marshes. Remote imagery will be used to identify thermal variations and resulting wildlife behavior at three Connecticut salt marshes. The compilation of this salt marsh specific data will add to general knowledge, particularly building on ecology, environmental science, and marine biology. The creation of an efficient procedure for obtaining temporal data using remote sensing equipment such as small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAV) and Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras will optimize operational capability in future data collection missions.\n\nCarter Takacs\n\nUniversity of New Haven Investigating genetic compensation as a biological response to deleterious mutations\n\nProlonged human exposure to ionizing radiation in space can lead to an accumulation of genetic mutations and increased cancer risk. Recent work has revealed that genetic mutations can be tolerated through genetic compensation, which refers to an organism’s ability to compensate for deleterious mutations by turning on unaffected genes that possess similar functions. We propose to use zebrafish as a model to 1) explore how this process is triggered and 2) identify cellular factors involved in this process. Ultimately, this work will inform biological strategies to mitigate the damaging effects of radiation, thereby enabling human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nShue Wang\n\nUniversity of New HavenMechanoregulation of osteogenic differentiation in simulated microgravity\n\nMicrogravity causes several physiological changes during space travel, including osteoporosis-like loss of bone mass. Although it is known weight-bearing exercises could potentially lower the risk of osteoporosis, the mechanisms underlying how mechanical loading affects cells and causes bone loss is not clear. We will first quantify the effects of simulated microgravity on osteogenesis – bone formation process- and identify the key signaling related to this process. Next, we will compare osteogenic differentiation in microgravity with and without applied mechanical compression to see if this returns the functions of the normal state. Completion of this project will provide a fundamental understanding of how changes in mechanical loading cause bone loss and osteoporosis, which will in turn improve and develop new treatments.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Programming\n\nRuth Blake\n\nYale University STEMing Up!\n\nThe shortage of ethnic youth engaged in STEM indicates the need for STEM to be valued by parents— children’s first and most influential teachers. It is also often said that youth need rolemodels that “look like them”. We propose to develop an engaging workshop for parents living in underserved neighborhoods that will expose them and their children to STEM careers/research and will be presented by a team of primarily ethnic STEM professionals. Parents will receive knowledge /tools to recognize and promote STEM engagement by their young children and foundations to prepare them for future participation in STEM summer camps.\n\nDonna Hylton\n\nMiddlesex Community College Adventures in Learning STEM Camp\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM Camp seeks to get children excited about learning by presenting opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math in creative and innovative ways. Campers learn about the marvels of science through scientific experiments, experience computer technology, learn the wonders of math, and the value of engineering. This year our camp will again be working with the Middletown Public Schools to help prepare pre-school children for kindergarten by using a program called Bridges to Brilliance. This app teaches young children letters, numbers, and concepts of STEM. Children will have tablets to explore during our program and this will be reinforced by integrating Lego projects for hands-on creativity.\n\nFaculty Project\n\nRuth Blake\n\nYale University Direct analysis of DNA-bound phosphate: Toward combining temperature with taxonomy in the search for life\n\nIsotope thermometry has been limited to only those organisms having biomineral hardparts such as shells, bones and teeth, which has excluded 2 entire domains of life: Bacteria and Archaea. The recently developed DNA Thermometry proxy, based on 18O:16O ratios of PO4 in DNA (DNA-PO4), now extends isotope thermometry to all lifeforms and habitats. Proposed work to develop methods for direct analysis of DNA-PO4 will allow faster analysis of smaller samples which is critical to future applications of DNA Thermometry including to linking temperature with taxonomy/metabolomics and addressing the key questions of who’s there? what they’re doing? and at what temperature?\n\nFaculty Travel\n\nIvana Milanovic\n\nUniversity of Hartford Travel to ASME FEDSM2020 conference in Rosen Shingle Creek Orlando, FL\n\nOne of NASA’s strategic objectives is cultivation of a workforce with the right balance of skills and experience. My research ‘Simulation-Based Approach to STEM Challenges,’ funded by CT SG Educational Grant 2019-2020, investigated the use of simulations, application building, and inquiry-based learning (IBL) in the undergraduate engineering curriculum,\n\nspecifically in the thermo-fluids topical thread. The project findings are described in detail in American Society of Mechanical Engineers Fluids Engineering Division Summer Meeting (FEDSM) conference paper ‘Unified Assessment Approach for Courses with Simulation Component.’ I am seeking funds to support travel to the ASME FEDSM2020 conference and present my research findings.\n\nFaculty-Student Research\n\nSarah Maurer\n\nCentral Connecticut State University Development of heterogenousa abiotic mixtures and analysis of their potential for chemical evolution\n\nHeterogenous abiotic mixtures will be prepared as is produced from interstellar and geochemical reactions. These mixtures will be used to model chemical evolution as a precursor for the origin of life. The mixtures will be exposed to cycles of drying and wetting such that would happen naturally from day/night cycles. The mixtures will be analyzed using LC-MS and analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis to determine the mixtures and conditions that are most likely to lead to complexity, and possibly life. NASA supports this work through its Science directorate under the Planetary Science Division through their Exobiology program.\n\nPeyton DeBowsky Manchester Community College\n\nNathan Linklater\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nFaculty Research\n\nLindsey Hanson\n\nTrinity College\n\nNanoparticle-polymer composites as optical stress sensors for early damage detection\n\nEarly detection of stress concentration is vital to the prevention of catastrophic failures in\n\naerospace components. An optical stress sensor, or material that converts mechanical stress into\n\nan optical readout, would allow for non-destructive, high throughput assessment of stresses before\n\ndamage progresses. Recent work showed that the absorbance spectrum of gold nanoparticles\n\nchanges with compressive stress. However, neither the effect of uniaxial compression or tension\n\non the optical response nor that of incorporating the particles into a polymer is known. In this\n\nproject, we will lay the foundations for self-reporting composite materials by incorporating gold\n\nnanoparticles into polymers and studying their optomechanical properties.\n\nSusan Masino\n\nTrinity College\n\nTree-based carbon: A comparison of existing models, direct measurement and citizen science\n\nAccurate measurements of tree volume and associated carbon storage are necessary to determine ongoing negative carbon emissions. Recent detailed measurements have found that the volume of larger, older trees is underestimated systematically. NASA satellites and missions have been focused on studying forests and the movement of carbon through ecosystems, and recently started a ground-based citizen science initiative using smartphones to measure tree height. Here, we partner established experts and undergraduate students to compare data gathered with traditional tools, state-of-the-art instrumentation and the citizen science initiative to enable cross-validation and highly accurate measurements of large trees growing within a forest setting.\n\nJohn Mertens\n\nTrinity College\n\nOptimization of Chemical Kinetics Model of NH3 Combustion Using Experimental Data\n\nDeveloping the most efficient methods for Energy Storage is critical for many power systems, both\n\non earth and in space. Major new international efforts are underway to study the use of ammonia\n\n(NH3) as an energy carrier, i.e. storing energy by synthesizing ammonia, and later recouping the\n\nenergy by combusting the ammonia. The goal of this study is to develop the definitive detailed gas\n\nphase chemical reaction mechanism for ammonia combustion, using extensive pre-existing and\n\nadditional new experimental measurements as benchmarks. This is strongly related to NASA’s\n\nGoal 2: Advance understanding of Earth and develop technologies to improve the quality of life on\n\nour home planet.\n\nRob Narzarian\n\nFairfield University\n\nGlobal Impacts of Mixing in Submarine Canyons\n\nModel simulations and observations suggest that individual submarine canyons can be regions of intense ocean mixing. Our goal is to calculate the total amount of the ocean’s mixing occurring in submarine canyons and determine its role in sustaining the ocean’s circulation. We will utilize a high-resolution ocean topography map and computational model for energy fluxes to calculate the mixing within each canyon based on Nazarian 2017a. This study supports NASA’s training and research missions by advancing our understanding of the distribution of mixing and its role in ocean circulation, as well as providing undergraduate students with a robust research experience.\n\nNoah Planavsky\n\nYale University\n\nTowards an Understanding of Phosphorus Cycling on Waterworlds\n\nPhosphorus is a key factor for life as we know it.. Continental weathering is considered\n\nthe only source of phosphorus to the oceans, implying that fluid-rich exoplanets (so called\n\nwaterworlds) may be biological deserts due to severe phosphorus limitation. However, in\n\ncontrast to the prevailing view, preliminary results from anoxic alteration experiments with\n\ncrystalline basalt indicate that anoxic basalt alteration is an efficient source of bioavailable\n\nphosphorus. We plan to extend this research with experiments at a range of environmental\n\nconditions, pH, pressure, and basalt types to provide a more robust framework to make predictions about exoplanetary biospheres.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Research\n\nElizabeth Cowles\n\nEastern Connecticut State University\n\nGoing Further: Do High School Research Experiences Impact Persistence in STEM?\n\nAttracting students to enter STEM fields is a NASA strategic goal. Research experience for undergraduates increases their persistence in STEM. Can research do the same for high school students? Here we assess the outcomes of a high school biotechnology research program. Our objectives are to analyze the effects of the following on applications and acceptances to college: student research participation, family influences, mentor-pairing and credentials in skill acquisition. The results will provide evidence on the most effective practices for attracting, retaining, and supporting students into college STEM programs.\n\nIvana Milanovic\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nSimulation-Based Approach to STEM Challenges\n\nOne of NASA’s strategic objectives is cultivation of a workforce with the right balance of skills and experience. The proposed research will investigate the use of simulations, application building, and inquiry-based learning (IBL) in the undergraduate engineering curriculum, specifically in the thermo-fluids topical thread. The objectives are to address the challenges of (1) moving students from being successful in highly structured tasks to navigating the unstructured tasks, and (2) fulfilling the ABET student outcome (k) which states that students should have the ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.\n\nFaculty STEM Education Programming\n\nDonna Hylton\n\nMiddlesex Community College\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM Camp\n\nAdventures in Learning STEM Camp seeks to get children excited about learning by presenting opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering, and math in creative and innovative ways.

The goal of the research is to develop a wearable system based on mixed reality (augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)) to help human quickly visualize and diagnose issues in space vehicles or habitats. Two undergraduate students will design and prototype the system which integrates Microsoft Hololens (AR), HTC VIVE and MANUS VR (VR), and a computer through software development using their application programming interface (API).\n\nGraduate Research Fellowship\n\nBaha Alsaqri\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nA Mutational Approach to Determining the Key Outer Membrane Cytochrome Complex for Fe(III) Oxide Reduction by Geobacter Metallireducens\n\nExtracellular electron transfer is used by anaerobic microorganisms that respire Fe(III) oxide. During this process, electrons pass the cell envelope using cytochromes. Geobacter metallireducens contains 3 cytochrome complexes (Pcc’s) that carry electrons from the outer membrane to the extracellular space, but we hypothesize that only 1 Pcc is required. This project’s objective is to determine the key Pcc using a mutational approach. Identifying the key Pcc will advance our understanding of Fe(III) reduction and offer insights into the evolutionary roots of this process. This project aligns with NASA’s mission to understand the molecular processes underpinning the conditions for life’s emergence.\n\nAllison Dowling\n\nWesleyan University\n\nOxygen and Hydrogen Isotopes in Asteroid Ryugu\n\nThe return samples of the asteroid Ryugu presents multiple questions about the materials found in the primitive Solar System. The objective of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the oxygen isotopes found in the phosphate in apatite (Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH), also known as hydroxyapatite, that is associated with primitive Solar System. While observing the oxygen isotopes, the measurement of bulk (δD) hydroxyapatite will be taken because the hydrogen isotopes help provide indicators for fluid on planetary bodies. In addition, the analysis of δD isotopes can be used to hypothesize the origin of water found on Earth.\n\nAlanna Gado\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nHigh Efficiency and High Durability Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers for Hydrogen Production with Advanced Catalyst Coated Membranes\n\nThe research outlined in this work is focused on the development of PSFA-free PEM water electrolyzers with low hydrogen crossover. The use of a dual platinum recombination later in a selected hydrocarbon membrane will minimize hydrogen crossover while ensuring high efficiency and durability. The development of a high performing, low hydrogen crossover PSFA-free PEMWE supports NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) by providing the ability to use electricity generated by photovoltaic arrays to produce and store hydrogen and oxygen, and then use fuel cells to provide the crew with electrical power as necessary during periods of darkness.\n\nAlexander Petroski\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University\n\nMeasuring High-Precision Internal Motions at the Core of Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae with Hubble Space Telescope Images\n\nGlobular clusters are dense clusters of stars which have eluded our understanding due to the difficulty of obtaining precise measurements of the internal motion of stars in their innermost regions. Using state-of-the-art astrometric techniques, I propose a pilot study of globular cluster 47 Tucanae to obtain higher-than-ever precision measurements of the internal motions of a globular cluster core. I plan to use HST data with an unprecedented time baseline of ~20 years to obtain proper motions per individual star with an error on the order of just 6.5-10 μas/yr. This measurement will help to constrain mass models of the cluster.\n\nClara Ramirez\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nEnhancing Product Development through the Integration of Model-Based Engineering Strategies and Harnessing the Power of the Digital Thread\n\nThis project is dedicated to advancing the system development process by employing innovative Model-Based Engineering (MBE) approaches that contribute to the augmentation and refinement of Digital Thread (DTh) integration. While successful demonstrations of the digital thread have been achieved at the part and process levels, there is a recognized need for further research to establish best practices in building the digital thread at the systems level for complex systems. The research delves into the optimal integration of systems models, physics-based systems models, manufacturing models, and test models to construct a comprehensive digital thread that optimizes processes across the entire development lifecycle.\n\nUndergraduate Research Grants\n\nSeamus Dwyer\n\nFairfield University\n\nAutomated Coil Pipe End Deburring System\n\nOur project aims to increase the efficiency of an automated pipe end deburring system. We intend for our system to operate via brushing methods, replacing the current system of pipe deburring by a drill component. The motivation for this change is that while the drill is effective short-term, the drill has to be replaced at least once a day, halting production and limiting the automation abilities. Our task will be to select a material for the bristles of the brush that can withstand the friction of deburring operation so the brush only has to be replaced approximately every two weeks. We will use strain gages on the coil pipe itself to monitor the behavior of the pipe, ensuring that the force of the deburring does not ultimately weaken the part. We will then use equations of strengths of materials and machine design to calculate the resulting stress in the coil pipe as well as to implement threads and tolerances if necessary. The automated system will run on a basic computer software that inspects the quality of the deburr as a sort of “if/then” statement, which can be verified using lab equipment which takes detailed photos of surfaces on the small scale. The main objective is to match or exceed the abilities of manual deburring, which we estimate to be approximately one pipe per minute for an output of 50-60 pipes per hour. However, the project would be especially worthwhile if we could surpass this minimum rate, perhaps deburring 2-3 pipes per minute.\n\nChiara Faiola\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nEvaluating Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Zinc, and Folate Effects on Protecting Mammalian Cells from Oxidative and Heat Stress Induced Damages and Death\n\nWhen cells are exposed to stress, they will choose a protective or destructive pathway to prevent the cell from mutating and becoming harmful to its host. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the different effects that vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and folate have on reducing the damaging effects of cell stress, and indicate which supplement is best for cell protection. This research intends to address a more practical method in terms of cost, space, and storage to maintain the health of astronauts for sustained manned missions.\n\nNatasha Lardie\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nExploring Space Transport Routes for Asteroid Mining\n\nAsteroid mining is an up-and-coming venture into the solar system that will help propel humans further into space through the commercial sampling of asteroids. Asteroid mining could have a broad reach that aids in the preservation of Earth’s finite landscape. The properties of the Hohmann transfer orbit combined with slingshot maneuvers, available technologies, and where the processing of samples occurs will be explored in regard to energy consumption. The research conducted will provide an interactive activity for high school students that will provide a direct connection to learned material and provide an example of what their futures may hold.\n\nStudent Project Grants\n\nElsa Durcan\n\nYale University\n\nDrone Navigation in a GPS Denied Environment\n\nLiquid-propellant rockets are used extensively within the aerospace industry for orbital and deeper space missions, aligning it closely with NASA’s HEO Mission Directorate. Unlike solid rocket boosters, they add a higher degree of functionality due to its re-startability, throttling capabilities, and efficiency. Project Liquid is a Yale Undergraduate Aerospace Association (YUAA) initiative to develop a deeper scientific understanding of these liquid propulsion technologies. Members will develop the technical skills necessary for post collegiate work in the aerospace industry, which will further humanity’s development of orbital and deep-space rocketry.\n\nOlivia McMichael\n\nTrinity College\n\nVariability in Wave Energy Capturing from Triboelectric Nanogenerator\n\nThis project aims to harness renewable energy from ocean waves by utilizing a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) converter. The primary objective is to create a scalable TENG wave energy converter (WEC) that efficiently transforms wave energy into usable electricity. Achieving this involves evaluating various TENG systems and selecting the most suitable one for integration into a WEC. The project also seeks to investigate how wave frequency and amplitude affect power generation, energy conversion and storage. Experimental tests will be conducted in a constructed wave tank under varying wave conditions to refine the design for effective energy conversion and storage.\n\nGrady Morrissey\n\nYale University\n\nYale Undergraduate Aerospace Association (YUAA) Bouchet Low Earth Alpha-Beta Space Telescope (BLAST) CubeSat\n\nThe identification of cosmic ray sources is an active area of research, and the energy distribution of the highest-energy particles at the largest scales has ramifications for cosmology and the theory of particles. We seek to identify and make measurements of the energy of particles in these showers, to contribute to the ongoing collection of data about these rays. Our specific objectives are to build a 2U CubeSat (20 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm) with fully developed radio communication, power supply, and attitude determination and control systems, which will detect cosmic rays in low earth orbit. In this specific proposal, we seek funding for our payload CRD components, and other fabrication expenses\n\nThe Bouchet Low Earth Alpha-Beta Space Telescope (BLAST) CubeSat serves as a STEM educational and research opportunity for Yale undergraduates. In 2018, YUAA was selected to participate in NASA’s CubeSat Student Launch Initiative (CSLI) and we have been corresponding with NASA since then. The project is divided into the subsystems of Radio, Cosmic Ray Detector Payload, Power, Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) and Software. Hence team members can explore many aspects of aerospace engineering such as running orbit simulations to determine the performance of the solar panels, designing subsystems to stabilize the position and orientation of the satellite, creating particle detectors in a compact form factor, and developing rigorous flight software. Since few students in YUAA have past experience working with satellites in a professional or research setting, we seek advice from professors and professionals, and review the extant research to make decisions. Learning about satellite construction and the physics of cosmic rays is an essential part of the project. The scientific objective of this project is to monitor changes in the morphology of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The SAA is a region where Earth’s inner van Allen belt drops in altitude from around 450km to around 200km, low enough to affect satellites in low Earth orbit. Satellites passing through the SAA often must shut down to avoid damage. Cosmic rays, high-energy particles of cosmic origin, sometimes become trapped in Earth’s van Allen belts. The CubeSat will include a scintillator-based cosmic ray detector to monitor the fluxes of multiple populations of cosmic rays, including protons and alpha particles. These measurements will allow us to track changes in the shape and size of the SAA. This work is only possible from space because the majority of cosmic rays are absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere. We plan to determine more information about the cosmic rays within the anomaly, and contribute to the ongoing study of this phenomenon.\n\nFeiayn Orourke\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nDesign and Development of Frequency Selective and Split-Ring Resonator Metamaterial Biological Sensing Technologies\n\nThe primary focus of this project is to design, test, and fabricate various configurations of Frequency Selective (FS) and Split-Ring Resonator (SRR) Metamaterial devices for biological sensing purposes. These sensors can be integrated into unmanned space probes and planetary rovers. A simultaneous investigation will be conducted to enhance these sensors for monitoring biological and non-biological impurities in living environments in space. We will use commercial Finite Element (FEM) software to design and test the initial device topologies across various scales of fabrication and frequency ranges within the microwave electromagnetic spectrum. The Multiscale Metamaterial Research Microwave Optics table will be used to test the most promising FS and SRR Metamaterial designs, which will be fabricated using a modified high-precision PCB milling technique. This project will enhance NASA-related research and strengthen collaboration with the Multiscale Metamaterial Research group at the University of Hartford.\n\nDermot Warner\n\nFairfield University\n\nCost Effective Vibration Table\n\nThis research project aims to create an affordable, compact vibration table for K-12 classrooms and NASA labs, primarily for testing space component resilience during launches, landings, and missions. The central challenge is to design this table using readily available components. Objectives involve simulating spacecraft mechanical vibrations, assessing diverse materials, and facilitating space system development. Key factors include cost-effectiveness, adaptability to various materials and vibration requirements, and suitability for educational and research applications. The methodology includes component research, design, testing protocol development, and analysis. Successful completion will provide a valuable, cost-effective tool for both education and NASA, enhancing accessibility to insights into space component behavior and system durability.\n\nZachary Zitzewitz\n\nYale University\n\nYale Rocketry Team – Spaceport America Cup ’24 Submission\n\nThe Yale Undergraduate Aerospace Association (YUAA) is devoted to helping undergraduates pursue their passion for aerospace, and competing in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) at Spaceport America will help us achieve our mission. This year, we will finish the construction of a composite single-stage rocket with innovative fabrication techniques to propel it to 10,000 feet above ground level. Redundant onboard electronics, including a student researched and designed flight computer, will deploy parachutes to safely recover the rocket, log flight data, and conduct a fluid dynamics experiment in a high-g environment. This innovative rocket will be flown at IREC during the summer of 2024.\n\nStudent Travel Grants\n\nRewa Bush\n\nWesleyan University\n\nTravel to 243rd Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans, LA.\n\nI request travel funding to attend the 243rd Meeting of AAS. At the meeting I will present my research probing the latest observations from New Horizons (NH) for evidence of clouds in the local interstellar medium. We use radiative transfer models to determine whether NH has detected an interstellar cloudscape surrounding the heliosphere, increasing our understanding of our solar system’s environs. This funding will enable me to build professional and presentations skills and make connections crucial to my PhD applications. We gratefully acknowledge NASA’s support of NH through contract NASW-02008 to SwRI and subcontract R99037CB to Wesleyan University.\n\nKylyn Smith\n\nYale University\n\nYale Undergraduate Aerospace Association’s Space Policy Research Collaborative\n\nBy the conclusion of the Yale Undergraduate Aerospace Association’s Space Policy Research Collaborative (SPRC), several focused research teams will produce full-length reports and accompanying briefings of sufficient detail and insight so as to be presentable to an official policy-making organization. The SPRC will partner with the Yale Joseph P. Allen i5 Squadron as well as receive direct mentorship from the Hacking for Defense national corporation to produce the most informed and effective work, targeting a spectrum of space topics, from detecting launches to navigating the military-industrial space complex to the regulatory implications of a proliferated space systems communication architecture.\n\nGabriella Wilkerson\n\nWesleyan University\n\nTravel to: The Forks, ME, Trip to the Totality\n\nThe Wesleyan Society of Physics Students (SPS) is run by Owen Dunton and Gabriella Wilkerson. SPS seeks a NASA travel grant to facilitate an expedition to the path of totality for the total solar eclipse occurring on April 8th, 2024. The path of totality will be passing just north of Wesleyan University. SPS intends to capitalize on this by organizing a short excursion to The Forks Maine an area nicely centered within the region of interest. The party will leave on 4.7.2024, and drive in rented vans to Cabins at Northern Outdoors in ME. They will stay there until the morning of 4.9.2024, at which point they will venture back to the Wesleyan campus. While there, attendees will work to run relativistic demos, conduct solar observations, and participate in journal clubs relating to the solar eclipse as well as continuing to work on their studies remotely. Those attending the trip will be undergraduates, grad students, post-docs, and faculty pursuing physics or astrophysics at the University. This trip aligns with the NASA Science Mission Directorate in many ways. Seeing such a natural marvel that specifically aligns with their areas of study will invigorate students to delve deeper into their studies. The integration of individuals at varying levels in their physics careers will allow for bonding and mentorship. Additionally, students intend to document the solar eclipse and will share their exciting experiences and enthusiasm with incoming physics majors. While SPS will be asking for a nominal fee for attending on the trip to supplement the total cost there is a sliding scale option to make the trip open to all.\n\nUndergraduate Scholarships\n\nBrittany Blair\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nLucas Danburg\n\nFairfield University\n\nJonathan Ho\n\nUniversity of Hartford\n\nJamar Kittling\n\nWesleyan University\n\nKalin Kochnev\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nMadison Olander\n\nCentral Connecticut State University\n\nCommunity College Transfer Scholarships\n\nGabriel Grant\n\nFairfield University\n\nJames Petkin\n\nSouthern Connecticut State University\n\nKristen Poplaski\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nCommunity College Scholarships\n\nHannah Ashiru\n\nNaugatuck Valley Community College\n\nJasmine Barber\n\nCapital Community College\n\nJosh Calderon\n\nNaugatuck Valley Community College\n\nAyssar Farah\n\nAsnuntuck Community College\n\nJoey Gonzalez\n\nNorwalk Community College\n\nPhilip Kwiatkowski\n\nMiddlesex Community College\n\nDanielle Salvatore\n\nNaugatuck Valley Community College\n\nBryan Viveros\n\nNaugatuck Valley Community College\n\nGraduate Research\n\nGuy Bennevat Haninovich\n\nWesleyan University\n\nMapping Macroblooms: Investigating the drivers of Sargassum invasion in the Caribbean\n\nInfluxes of pelagic Sargassum Natans and Sargassum Fluitans, beginning in 2011, has created a new Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt (GASB) that is being influenced by a multicontinental set of drivers. The GASB has had catastrophic effects on coastal livelihoods and aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this research is to develop a spectral library spanning multiple species and clones of algae and a procedure for spectral analysis of surficial macroalgae mats. This work will provide context for the spatial distribution of algae mats in relation to their driving forces.\n\nKatie Durkee\n\nUniversity of New Haven\n\nGenerating Self-Healing Polymers from Biomass Resources for Space Related Applications\n\nPolymers from biomass resources are next-generation materials. The goal of this project is to develop self-healing polymers containing carbon nanotubes from biomass sources. Current polymers are synthesized using petroleum resources. However, at the current rate of consumption, these resources are expected to be depleted in the coming decades. This research will use biomass resources to synthesize novel polymer networks containing carbon nanotubes. The polymer/carbon nanotube network materials developed could be used to make NASA’s mission to Mars more feasible. These polymers could be employed in protecting astronauts from harmful radiation, developing a residence on Mars, and designing a spacecraft.\n\nAndrew Gibbs\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nConstraining Dust Properties from Mid- and Far-Infrared Data in M33: A Pilot for JWST\n\nThe era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun and brought exiting new science to the world of Astronomy and Astrophysics. One of the key improvements of JWST over other telescopes is its ability to observe the infrared (IR) emission of dust that surrounds stars at high resolution. The caveat, however, is that the wavelength range it can observe this emission at is highly limited and therefore there can be crucial information left out. In this project, we investigate whether or not we can provide any constraints in just the near to mid IR range.\n\nJosué Martínez-Martínez\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nTrustworthy AI for Astronauts Computer-Aided Diagnostic Systems\n\nThe development of trustworthy AI for health and astronauts is an important area of research that has the potential to greatly benefit space exploration and medicine. By utilizing machine learning and medical imaging data, AI models can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions for astronauts in space. The development of explainable AI models can ensure that medical professionals and astronauts can understand and trust the decisions made by these models. In this project is proposed a robust and explainable AI CAD system. This is going to be accomplished by using the RobustAugMix technique and the SHAP methods.\n\nSkyler Wright\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nEstimating the Star Formation Efficiency of Molecular Clouds Using Deterministic and Stochastic Modeling Techniques\n\nThrough measuring the 21μm extinction-corrected Hɑ and FUV luminosities of HII regions in the M33 galaxy, mass and age estimates for those regions can be approximated through comparison with stellar population synthesis models such as Starburst99 and SLUG. This allows us to estimate star formation efficiency (SFE) on scales of less than 10pc, far smaller than previous kpc-scale studies. This is crucial to understanding how the interstellar medium (ISM) is transformed into stars across disparate scales – this is a topic of interest under NASA’s SMD, specifically the question of “How did we get here?”\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\nHanna Adamski\n\nYale University\n\nSchool\n\nThe Signature of Planet Nine in Earth’s Orbital Elements\n\nAn outstanding mystery in the outer solar system is the origin of the unexpected orbital clustering of extreme trans-"
