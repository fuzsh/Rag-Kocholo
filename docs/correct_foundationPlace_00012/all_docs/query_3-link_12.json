        "text": "Throwback to last week when I hosted a panel session on the main stage at the #AISummitLondon Thank you to my fellow panellists, Francesco Federico (Global CMO, S&P Global Ratings), Sara-Amanda O'Keane (Managing Director, Barclays Investment Bank), Tom Betts (Group Data Director, Kingfisher Plc), and Ranil Boteju (Group Chief Data and Analytics Officer, Lloyds Banking Group and the second most influential person in this years' #DataIQ100) for a truly insightful discussion on real-world scaling strategies for industry leaders. Your perspectives on strategically driving AI initiatives and sharing insights into how you are navigating implementation and internal buy-in were invaluable. For those in the audience whose questions we couldn't get to, I'd love to continue the conversation! Join me at the DataIQ Discussion event this Wednesday, June 19 at The HAC, London. We'll be diving deeper into winning with AI, and I'll be happy to sign copies of my new book! Register here: https://lnkd.in/egqHeVG7\n\nVery insightful and dynamic panel session this week as part of Alteryx #inspire watch party in London, catching up on highlights from the Las Vegas event and talking about \"Navigating the evolution of AI: Today's world and tomorrow's possibilities.\" Thanks to Jawwad Rasheed for his excellent facilitation and to my fellow panellists Santiago Castro and @nickwhitfeld for bringing their A game. What did we discuss? Whether AI represents an existential threat to data engineers and data scientists. (The answer is, it depends, by the way...) What role citizen scientists can play in improving AI and genAI solutions in their organisation. (The answer is, be part of the human reinforcement learning process, even if it just using a simple RAG response.) Some of the best conversations were in response to audience Qs. How can a BI manager get away from repetitive report and dashboard building? What are the risks of using AI to improve data in a highly-sensitive environment like national security? (If you want the answers to those, you'll need to join me at another event or invite me to participate in one of your own...) So thanks again Alteryx for inviting me along. I look forward to navigating through the next few years alongside you! DataIQ #dataanalytics"
