        "text": "Infrastructure services (Infrastructure-as-a-service), provided by cloud vendors, allow any user to provision a large number of compute instances fairly easily. Whether leased from public clouds or allocated from private clouds, utilizing these virtual resources to perform data/compute intensive analyses requires employing different parallel runtimes to implement such applications.\n\nRecent advances in high-throughput instrument technologies allow small research labs to obtain data for scientific projects of their interest in a cost-effective way. In biology and medicine, this opened a door to a genome-wide study. Unfortunately, many small research labs are unable to afford the analysis of such data since the data analysis task requires bioinformatics experts and a good computing infrastructure to process and analyze a large amount of data.\n\nThe ever growing technology has resulted in the need for storing and processing excessively large amounts of data on cloud. The current volume of data is enormous and is expected to replicate over 650 times by the year 2014, out of which, 85% would be unstructured. This is known as the ‘Big Data’ problem.

Unfortunately, there is still confusion about the cloud model and its advantages and disadvantages over tradition supercomputing based problem solving methods. In this note we characterize the ways in which cloud computing can be used productively in scientific and technical applications. As we shall see there is a large set of application that can run on a cloud and a supercomputer equally well.

The ever growing technology has resulted in the need for storing and processing excessively large amounts of data on cloud. The current volume of data is enormous and is expected to replicate over 650 times by the year 2014, out of which, 85% would be unstructured. This is known as the ‘Big Data’ problem. The techniques of Hadoop, an efficient resource scheduling method and a probabilistic redundant scheduling, are presented for the system to efficiently organize &quot;free&quot; computer storage resources existing within enterprises to provide low-cost high-quality storage services. The proposed methods and system provide valuable reference for the implementation of cloud storage system. The proposed method includes a Linux based cloud."
