        "text": "Testing mobile apps can be a pain, especially with the wide range of OS versions in the Android ecosystem and myriad devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, capabilities and so on -- while iOS developers, of course, enjoy a far narrower scope of testing requirements.\n\nAlthough device emulators are available for single-device manual testing, such as the Android Virtual Device (AVD) built into Android Studio, and the popular third-party option for Android, GenyMotion, they don't allow for automated testing on a variety of real devices.\n\nSuch testing is made easier with the cloud computing phenomenon, allowing access to large device clouds or farms featuring hundreds or even thousands of real devices, along with emulators and simulators. Mobile developers don't have to worry about the impractical proposition of rounding up their own devices for testing.\n\nMobile app device clouds come in all shapes and sizes, with different pricing models, target audiences, feature sets and use cases. The landscape -- or rather, cloudscape -- can be confusing, so we've summarized some of the popular options for you. Read on to see what solution fits your needs.\n\nAWS Device Farm\n\nThis comes from Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS), the leading cloud computing platform.\n\nCompany's Service Description: AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and Web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time. View video, screenshots, logs, and performance data to pinpoint and fix issues before shipping your app.\n\nPricing: Three levels are offered: pay as you go, $0.17/device minute, with first 1,000 minutes free; unlimited testing, starts at $250/month; private devices (test on dedicated devices deployed exclusively for your account), starts at $200/month.\n\nAvailable Devices: 206 Android and Fire OS devices; 152 iOS devices. An interactive device list is available.\n\nNotes: Two primary testing methods are provided -- automated testing on a variety of frameworks and remote access to devices on which developers can load, run and interactively test Android apps in real time. It tests native and hybrid apps, including apps created with PhoneGap, Titanium, Xamarin, Unity and other frameworks. If developers don't have their own tests, a built-in fuzz test is available. Tests are run on real, non-rooted devices, a mixture of OEM and carrier-branded offerings.\n\nFirebase Test Lab for Android\n\nFormerly called the Google Cloud Test Lab, this has been integrated into the Firebase development platform that also offers a variety of other back-end services to support mobile app development.\n\nCompany's Service Description: Firebase Test Lab for Android provides cloud-based infrastructure for testing Android apps. With one operation, you can initiate testing of your app across a wide variety of devices and device configurations. Test results -- including logs, videos, and screenshots -- are made available in your project in the Firebase console. Even if you haven't written any test code for your app, Test Lab can exercise your app automatically, looking for crashes.\n\nPricing: Firebase comes in three plans: Spark, for free, with limitations; Flame, $25 per month; and Blaze, a pay-as-you-go model.\n\nAvailable Devices: The list of available Android devices is available through a command-line tool.\n\nNotes: It can use developer-provided instrumentation tests or its built-in Robo test that analyzes the structure of an app's UI and then explores it by automatically simulating user activities. It's integrated with Android Studio, the Firebase console and the gcloud command line. Developers can also use it with Continuous Integration (CI) systems. It provides real production devices that are flashed with updated Android API levels or locale settings that developers specify so they can road-test apps against a real-world collection of real devices and device configurations.\n\nXamarin Test Cloud\n\nAcquired by Microsoft last year, Xamarin enables cross-platform app development using the C# programming language.\n\nCompany's Service Description: Find bugs before you ship with automated tests running on the devices your customers use. You can test everything your users can do, from pinching and swiping to double-tapping and scrolling. Find performance problems on any OS automatically with step-by step memory and performance tracking. Beautiful reports make it easy to know when you're ready for launch.\n\nPricing: Plans with varying levels of limitations and capabilities include: Newbie, $99/month; Small Startup, $379/month; Growing Business, $799/month; and Enterprise, contact for a quote. A 30-day trial is available.\n\nAvailable Devices: It currently lists 2,624 devices, running iOS 8 through iOS 10 and many Android versions from Honeycomb to Jelly Bean.\n\nNotes: Developers can write tests in C#, Ruby with Cucumber, or Java with Appium. Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio can be used for C# tests, and Xamarin Test Cloud templates are integrated into those IDEs. It can integrate with standard NUnit test runners. Code can be shared for cross-platform tests between iOS and Android. For automated tests, Xamarin engineers can provide hands-on coaching to get projects started. Functionality includes changing GPS locations, pressing physical buttons, activating device cameras and rotating the device between portrait and landscape modes.\n\nKobiton\n\nWhile some device clouds are provided only from within more full-featured app development and testing platforms, this offering from Atlanta-based startup Kobiton Inc. is all about device testing.\n\nCompany's Service Description: Kobiton is a mobile cloud platform that enables users to perform manual or automated testing on physical iOS and Android devices.\n\nPricing: Three plans are available: Indie, $10/month or $100 annually; Team, $199/month or $2,000 annually; Growing Biz, $499/month or $5,000 annually. A 15-day trial for all is available.\n\nAvailable Devices: 160 devices are available in several families, including iPhone7, Google Pixel, Galaxy S7 Edge and iPads.\n\nNotes: It supports Web automation or manual testing of Web, native and hybrid apps. All devices are real, no emulators. Devices can't be used to make phone calls or send SMS messages, but device cameras can be used. Application files up to 500 MB are supported. Automatically created activity logs provide detailed reports and screenshots of issues in real time so developers can release apps sooner. Developers can manage and access internal devices anytime, anywhere.\n\nPerfecto\n\nPerfecto Mobile Ltd. provides device testing in several ways, including its Continuous Quality Lab. The company offers manual testing, test automation, mobile performance testing and real-device monitoring.\n\nCompany's Service Description: Our Continuous Quality Lab helps you easily mobilize your brand by perfecting the digital experiences that define it. Our 14 highly-secure data centers are home to thousands of real devices that are accessed from any browser -- simply leave the device management to us. Perfecto has saved our customers over $156M each year through the elimination of manual testing.\n\nPricing: Three plans include: Basic, $99/month/user or $1,188 per year/billed annually; Advanced, $299/month/user or $3,588 per year/billed annually; and Enterprise, call for quote.
