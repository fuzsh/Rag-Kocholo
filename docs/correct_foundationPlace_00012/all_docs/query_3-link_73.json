Whether developing a product or providing a service, companies are rushing to get their businesses cloud ready, increasingly (big) data driven and flexible enough to take advantage of the inherent business scalability opportunities offered by the cloud. And as the focus switches to the scale economies of execution, from ever cheaper opaque hosted web storage and connected services to the immutable containers movement, a question arises: what is the role of Open Source software in a world in which not only software (SaaS), but also platform (PaaS) and infrastructure (IaaS) are increasingly delivered (and consumed) as hosted services? In this session, we'll attempt to answer to this question, by providing examples of Open Source cloud & big data companies and studying the effects of open development ecosystems and how Open Source is engrained in the fabric of the Cloud.\n\nApacheCon NA 2015 - Gabriele Columbro - Is Open Source the right model in the Cloud Era?\n\n1. Is Open Source the right model in the Cloud Rush era? Gabriele Columbro Sr. Product Manager. Core Platform / API, Alfresco Software @mindthegabz\n\n2. 2 A look at our presentation agenda The Open Source Cloud Journey Born in the OSS Sketches, notes and sensations from an Open Source decade Trends of the Cloud Era SaaSification of Products and Enterprises, *aaS and value-based offerings\n\n3. 3 Open Source vs. Cloud Trends, fears, value of software vs. services in the SaaS world, do software licenses even makes sense nowadays? Open Source + Cloud There would be no cloud with open source, the Devops movement, the Github generation OSS as a business model The Open Source product and services model in the cloud era The Commoditization Era Open Source has commoditized software, Cloud has commoditized hardware\n\n4. 4 A look at our presentation agenda The End Take-aways If you were bored, or just lazy, this is really the part you want to remember! :)\n\n5. Born in the OSS Doubts of an open source fundamentalist in the SaaS world\n\n6. 6 -Gabriele Columbro- Sr. Product Manager, Core Platform / API, Alfresco Software ”Grown in the flourishing Open Source Enterprise ecosystem of the last decade, bringing a wealth of expertise on ECM, Application Lifecycle Management, Developer ergonomics, SaaS and PaaS architectures, both in terms of Product and People leadership”\n\n7. The early integrator days ApacheCon EU Dublin 2006\n\n8. The early product days In the end, you don’t want it to be ‘just work’ - John Powell, Alfresco CEO 2010\n\n9. The Apache Way Working up the meritocracy ladder\n\n10. 10 And then came the Cloud With all its goods and bads No more software downloads? Wait no more hardware either? Where’s my source? Is the Open Source model even still relevant?\n\n11. 11 A persona driven view on Open Source The Open Source Model? For the Developer A software development approach based on community and ecosystem collaboration, where results of your work are publicly available and contribute to create your portfolio For the End User A software delivery methodology which enables users to access sources and binaries, install, evaluate and use the product with no charge For the Entrepreneur A market differentiator on which to build a product or services company profitable business model\n\n12. Chronicles from the Cloud Rush Era Trends and data on Cloud and Open Source\n\n13. Cloud adoption soaring 2015 http://assets.rightscale.com/uploads/pdfs/RightScale-2015-State-of-the-Cloud- Report.pdf\n\n14. Down and deep in the stack http://www.mazikglobal.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cloud-Service- Models.png\n\n15. Cloud strategy is focused on value http://assets.rightscale.com/uploads/pdfs/RightScale-2015-State-of-the-Cloud- Report.pdf\n\n16. 16 Timothy Mantanovic - Technology Services Industry Association Value based pricing Value pricing is an organizational belief system with the core tenet that price should be based on the economic impact of a service on the customer’s business, i.e., the economic value delivered, relative to competitive alternatives. http://blog.tsia.com/blog/book-excerpt-profitable-technology-services-pricing-by-timothy-mantanovich\n\n17. Fastest growing SaaS embrace value-based http://blog.kaseya.com/blog/2015/02/09/msp-pricing-survey-growth-leaders-sell- value/\n\n18. 18 No SaaS, no party The rush for SaaSification 1. Private, hybrid and public cloud adoption is rising quickly in the Enterprise, faster than what was predicted years ago. 2015 is a key year. 2. On Premise Product companies are quickly moving towards providing SaaS offerings to respond to market demand and compete on innovation with pure SaaS players 3. SaaS, IaaS, PaaS, BaaS, *aaS are commoditizing lower and lower layers of the stack and lowering the entry barrier for companies entering the brave new world 4. Cost and pricing focus is quickly switching from software to actual value (ROI) a company can realize by using your service\n\n19. So is Cloud killing the Open Source model?\n\n23. 23 The Cloud would not exist without Open Source An Open Source Cloud infrastructure army ”Facebook is built on open source from top to bottom, and could not exist without it” - https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/folly-the-facebook-open-source-library/10150864656793920 ”Open source can exist without cloud computing, but cloud computing can't exist without http://thevarguy.com/var-guy/red-hat-ceo-cloud-cant-exist-without-open-source\n\n24. 24 Public and Private clouds live and breathe open source And what about the Public Cloud itself?\n\n25. 25 Public and Private clouds live and breathe open source And private Clouds?\n\n26. 26 The rationale behind this is twofold So it’s Open Source + Cloud! Scale Economies Cultural roots Open source licensing enables horizontal scaling and commoditization of software on top commoditized hardware Cloud is powered by DevOps, a natively global culture with strong roots in Open Source values like sharing and the “bazaar”\n\n27. 27 Stephen O’Grady - RedMonk And what about the User? If it’s easier to download and spin up an open source database than talk to a salesperson, it’s even easier to download nothing at all and make setup, operation and backup of that database someone else’s problem. http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/03/17/open-source-and-aas/\n\n28. 28 A persona driven view on Open Source The Open Source Model? For the Developer A software development approach based on community and ecosystem collaboration, where results of your work are publicly available and contribute to create your portfolio For the End User A software delivery methodology which enables users to access sources and binaries, install, evaluate and use the product with no charge For the Enterpreneur A market differentiator on which to build a product or services company profitable business model\n\n29. 29 So is Open Source dead as a business model? Open Source business model history 1993 First Redhat Linux distribution 1994 First Successful Commercial Open Source stock exchange listing Redhat NYSE Listing 2006\n\n30. 30 Bought for $1B (although rumors say revenue was only $65M at the time of acquisition) Mysql Acquisition2008 “The leader in Open Source Enterprise Content Management” 2010 “The Open Source Business Intelligence and data integration leader” Pentaho2010 “The world fastest growing open source CRM company” SugarCRM 2010 Alfresco Software\n\n31. 31 2015 ”The decline of ‘open source’ as an identifying differentiator” Matthew Aslett - 451 Group http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2011/06/27/the-decline-of-open-source-as-an-identifying-differentiator/ 2011 We are living in a post open source world! Matt Asay http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608576/open-source-software/open-source-software-we-re-living-in-a-post-open-source-world.html 2014\n\n32. Economics of open source http://peter.a16z.com/2014/02/14/why-there-will-never-be-another- redhat-the-economics-of-open-source/\n\n33. 33 why Open Source per se does not make sense as a business model Considerations on commercial Open Source 1. Open Source seemed has won battle for software commoditization, i.e. it’s no more a differentiator, it’s table stakes (especially at infra level) 2. The talent pool available to work on Open Source projects has immensely grown over the last decade, so value in providing high-cost specialized open source support services is decreasing 3. SaaS is driving the switch to value-based economics so that focus is no more on software and it’s nature, but on value 4. The major (and most successful) open source contributors are not Open Source companies, nor they sell software. 5. While enterprise interest for declines for Open Source per se (de facto standard), Open Standards is highly ranked in IT and Business departments as a key differentiator\n\n34. 34 Open Standards on Open Source 1. Open Standards are better implemented in an Open Source environment fostering collaboration on a meritocratic public arena that mediates corporate interests 2. HTTPd or Chemistry OpenCMIS 3. Behlendorf: Every successful internet standard came from open source protocols. #ApacheCon 4. Warning: Too many open source projects for the same purpose might kill the purpose for an Open Standard, e.g. OpenStack vs. CloudStack vs. NetflixOSS. Open standards (and innovation) can benefit from consolidation of open source projects.\n\n35. 35 A persona driven view on Open Source The Open Source Model? For the Developer A software development approach based on community and ecosystem collaboration, where results of your work are publicly available and contribute to create your portfolio For the End User A software delivery methodology which enables users to access sources and binaries, install, evaluate and use the product with no charge For the Enterpreneur A marketing differentiator on which to build a product or services company profitable business model\n\n36. 36 True Open Source won again!The Cloud is driving the real value of Open Source, i.e. that software and knowledge should be common domain and revenue is attached to value-add services based on open source components rather than on mere one-size-fit-all maintenance and service price tags for OSS projects So ultimately…\n\n37. Conclusions and take-aways Ok, this is really somewhat important for you to listen to :)\n\n38. 38 Just not to forget Take-aways Open Source + Cloud It’s not open source vs. *aaS, openSource + *aaS for the win! There’s no cloud without open source Open Source is the fabric of the cloud, as that’s where the whole economy of scale lies, i.e. commoditized SW on top of commoditized HW But Cloud is giving back By fostering the proliferation of open source technologies, who no more play catch up mode to proprietary alternative but drive innovation Open Source is table stakes in the Cloud IT Open source is growingly commoditized, i.e. CIOs expects open source or a reason not to, especially in the cloud commoditized world Open Standards are the real value Enterprises and vendors are increasingly understanding the value of open standards, especially at cloud scale, and the Open Source development model fosters high quality and adoption of standards The new open source cloud business model Delivering value to users in a service fashion leveraging open source technologies is the new de- facto standard of customer-driven and successful SaaS companies\n\n39. 39 WHAT WHY WHERE WHEN WHO HOW Any Question??? Or comment, suggestion, praise, applause, yawn or wildly positive/negative feedback?\n\n40. And what about the internet of things? https://www.blackducksoftware.com/news/releases/2014-future-open-source-survey-results-revealed\n\n41. 41 Alfresco Software Americas Apache Software Foundation gabriele@apache.orgSr. Product Manager, Core Platform / API Gabriele Columbro @mindthegabz Thank you for listening!"
