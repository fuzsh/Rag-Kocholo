Cloud computing is a normal evolution of distributed computing combined with Service- oriented architecture, leveraging most of the GRID features and Virtualization merits.

We were very pleased to receive top quality contributions. We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the CLOUD COMPUTING 2015 technical program committee, as well as the numerous reviewers. The creation of such a high quality conference program would not have been possible without their involvement. We also kindly thank all the authors that dedicated much of their time and effort to contribute to CLOUD COMPUTING 2015. We truly believe that, thanks to all these efforts, the final conference program consisted of top quality contributions. Also, this event could not have been a reality without the support of many individuals, organizations and sponsors. We also gratefully thank the members of the CLOUD COMPUTING 2015 organizing committee for their help in handling the logistics and for their work that made this professional meeting a success. We hope that CLOUD COMPUTING 2015 was a successful international forum for the exchange of ideas and results between academia and industry and to promote further progress in the area of cloud computing, GRIDs and virtualization.

The technology foundations for cloud computing led to a new approach of reusing what was achieved in GRID computing with support from virtualization. We welcomed technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. We take here the opportunity to warmly thank all the members of the CLOUD COMPUTING 2012 Technical Program Committee, as well as the numerous reviewers.
