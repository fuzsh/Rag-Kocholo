        "text": "About Jesse Proudman\n\nI have had a passion for Internet infrastructure since the age of 13, specifically for the infrastructure “plumbing” that powers the Internet. Over the past 17 years, I’ve had the privilege of participating in almost every facet of infrastructure operations. Moving from systems administration and operations to software development, and then from CEO to CTO, I’ve been in the fortunate position of being able to manifest my passion into day-to-day execution.\n\nIn 2006, Blue Box launched a public cloud powered by containers. Building the company based on that technology offering, I was able to watch the meteoric rise of OpenStack and to become engrossed with the power of the ecosystem. I began to closely watch OpenStack in 2011 and became an avid fan shortly thereafter. As the CTO of Blue Box, an OpenStack based Private Cloud as a Service company; I’m presently focused on bringing the power of OpenStack into the hands of the masses and on eliminating as much of the operational burden commonly associated with the offering as possible.\n\nI am a voice of the OpenStack Operator as an active blogger, through my interactions with the press and analyst community, and in my speaking engagements at a wide range of events.\n\nOver the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing additional thoughts on what I would like to accomplish as a board member here: http://go.bluebox.net/openstack-board\n\nAbout Monty Taylor\n\nMonty is the founder, core member and past PTL of the OpenStack Infra team which runs CI and developer tooling for OpenStack. He's a founding admin of OpenDev and Zuul. He's a past member of the OpenStack Foundation Board of Directors, a Python Fellow and past member the OpenStack Technical Committee. Monty is past PTL of the openstacksdk project and is the past maintainer of the Ansible modules for consuming OpenStack. Before his OpenStack days he was a core developer on Drizzle and was a Senior Consultant for MySQL, Inc.\n\nMonty has a degree in Theatre Directing and went to grad school at CalArts in lighting design. The intersection of fields has led him to start more than one business around developing technology for and related to live performance. Recently Monty served as an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts teaching a class on programming related to lighting design. If you let him, he'll talk to you WAY too much about Scuba Diving.\n\nAbout Randy Bias\n\nHis prescient views on the profound disruption caused by cloud computing have made Randy Bias one of the industry’s most influential voices. He is an evangelist who was among the first to articulate the generational transition of IT from mainframe to enterprise computing and then to cloud in addition to popularizing the cloud server \"pets vs. cattle\" meme.\n\nRandy was an early and vocal supporter of the OpenStack project and Cloudscaling was part the initial OpenStack launch in summer of 2010. He led the teams that deployed the first public OpenStack storage cloud (Swift) outside of Rackspace, and the first public OpenStack compute cloud (Nova). He is a founding Board Member of the OpenStack Foundation. He continues to be a vocal advocate of OpenStack, through his company, his writing and his speaking engagements.\n\nHis voice is frequently heard in media outlets such as GigaOm, InformationWeek, The Economist, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, ReadWriteWeb, O’Reilly Radar, Light Reading, and others, in addition to the Cloudscaling blog. He is a regular keynote speaker and panelist at events from the OpenStack Summit to VMworld, Structure, eComm, CloudConnect, Interop, CloudBeat, CloudExpo, The Web Summit, and Gluecon.\n\nAbout Vishvananda Ishaya\n\nVish Ishaya is the Chief Technology Officer at Nebula, Inc. Prior to joining Nebula, he was a Principal Engineer with Rackspace Cloud Builders.

He has been a member of the OpenStack Technical Committee since its inception, and was recently elected to the OpenStack Board, which along with other prominent community members helps guide the vision of the OpenStack project.\n\nVish was elected to four consecutive terms as the OpenStack Compute Project Technical Lead. In addition to his excellent programming and systems skills, Vish has spent over a decade teaching, most recently classes in object oriented analysis and design.\n\nAbout Russell Bryant\n\nRussell is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, Inc. He was on the OpenStack Technical Committee from Fall 2012 until Fall 2016 and was elected to serve on the OpenStack Foundation Board of Directors in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Russell has been contributing to the development of OpenStack since the Fall of 2011. His most significant contributions around OpenStack have been to Nova and most recently Neutron and OVN. Russell is also a project committer for Open vSwitch (OVS) and OVN.\n\nPrior to working for Red Hat, Russell spent 7 years (2004 - 2011) working for Digium on the Asterisk project. In the later years, Russell was the leader of the Asterisk project as well as the Engineering Manager for Asterisk development at Digium.\n\nRussell is also a published author. Russell co-authored \"Asterisk: The Definitive Guide\" and \"Asterisk Cookbook\", published by O'Reilly Media. He also contributed a chapter on Asterisk to the book \"Architecture of Open Source Applications\".\n\nRussell graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in the Fall of 2006. He currently resides in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAbout Rob Hirschfeld\n\nI've been involved in OpenStack since the earliest days with a focus on ops and building the infrastructure that powers cloud and storage.\n\nOn the board, I've lead the DefCore initative and founded the Product Working Group. I also work to help screen and coach new Gold Members. I am a strong advocate for operators and interoperability.\n\nI believe that the OpenStack community is service by having a clearly defined core. I feel that we need to do a better job defining and building an ecosystem around the project.\n\nI maintain an open balanced perspective and respect other people's points of view.\n\nYou can read more about my thoughts and positions regarding OpenStack and Cloud on my blog: http://RobHirschfeld.com.\n\nAbout Haiying Wang\n\nHaiying Wang melds deep technical experience with strong business sense. He joined Huawei in 2010 and is the VP and CTO of Cloud Computing, responsible for Cloud strategy and technology. He initiated and is spearheading Huawei’s OpenStack cloud effort, leading Huawei to transform into an Open Source enthusiast and champion. Haiying's mission is to make OpenStack adoption easier in the Telco and emergent market. Prior to Huawei, Haiying co-founded and served as CEO of Digital Support Technology, a company focused on delivering an innovative online support service. Haiying was involved in infrastructure virtualization and abstraction from the early days, leading an R&D team at VMware when its engineering grew from 100+ to 1000+. Prior to VMware, he joined the initial Vitria Technology engineering team as a Sr. Architect. Vitria Technology was a leading business enterprise application integration company. At SGI, Haiying contributed to the world first interactive TV system. Haiying holds a Ph.D in Computer Science from University of Alberta and an MBA from Wharton School.\n\nAbout Alex Freedland\n\nAlex Freedland is the co-founder and CEO of Mirantis, the largest independent company focusing on delivering pure-play OpenStack to the customers worldwide.\n\nUnder Alex's leadership, Mirantis has become the contributor to OpenStack and is the only private company amongst Top-10 contributors.\n\nMirantis is also laser-focused on making customers (large and small) adopt OpenStack at scale. With that in mind, we have also pioneered such projects as Fuel (the point and click installer), Rally (a popular framework for scalability testing of OpenStack), Sahara (the orchstrator for Hadoop distributions running on top of OpenStack), Murano (an intuitive way to automate workload orchestration on top of OpenStack and the project behind the Foundation Application Catalog) and Stackalytics.\n\nPrior to starting Mirantis, Alex have co-founded several other businesses, some of which are operating today and some have successfully exited.\n\nAlex was born in Moscow, Russia, and currently resides in the SF Bay Area.\n\nAbout Edgar Magana\n\nI am currently member of the Board of Directors and I want to continue in this position because I am working very hard in making an impact for the benefit of all developers and users (operators, end users, app developers, etc.). In my very short period as Board Member (lest that six months) I have already proposed changes to the Foundation bylaws and I will continue my work even if I am not elected for the next year because I have passion and love for OpenStack. I need your support because we are already making a difference and I want to keep it that way. I am not the type of member just sitting in a chair drinking coffee, I always speak up and make the difference that we need in our Foundation for our own benefit, better engagement and increase of the community membership.\n\nI am part of the Cloud Operations and Infrastructure team for one of the biggest SaaS providers. My current role as OpenStack consumer is giving me a different opinion about what OpenStack should integrate and how it can be consumed easier and more scalable for both Service Providers and Entreprises. I am planning to provide my experience to the OpenStack Board in order to drive its direction based on the interest of the Operators and Users, never influenced by technology-specific vendors.\n\nProfessionally, I have a PhD on Distributed Systems and I have specialized on Cloud Computing, Network Virtualization, Software-defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), OpenFlow and the most important OpenStack. During my last three positions at Cisco, PLUMgrid and Workday I have completed successful OpenStack deployment in heterogeneous and scalable infrastructures, from vendor specific hardware to commodity one. All improvements have been shared and I have created extended experience on configuration languages such as Puppet and Chef.\n\nAbout Egle Sigler\n\nEgle Sigler is a principal architect on Rackspace's OpenStack Private Cloud team and an OpenStack Foundation board member. As part of the board, Egle is co-chair of the Interop Working Group (formerly known as DefCore committee). Egle has co-authored two books, DevOps for VMware Administrators and OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook.\n\nEgle wants OpenStack to be regarded as one of the most successful open source projects, with a great community to back it. During the past year, Egle has been co-chair of Interop WG (DefCore committee), where she has seen that the impact interop has on OpenStack is crucial. Interoperability is one of the top OpenStack priorities, and she continues leading the efforts to increase it.\n\nAbout Shane Wang\n\nShane Wang is an Engineering Director of Cloud Software at Intel's System Software Products. He has participated in or led his team on research and development of open source software projects such as Xen, tboot, Yocto and OpenStack. He has been serving as an Individual Director of OpenStack Foundation Board since 2015, with years of commitment to community development and building. Currently he is focusing on software-defined networking (SDN) and software-defined storage (SDS) technologies, edge computing, and NFV-related domains, including OpenStack, Ceph, SODA (also known as OpenSDS), ONAP, Akraino, StarlingX, OpenDaylight, OPNFV, DPDK, and so forth. He is interested in edge computing much so he is engaged in other open source solutions such as EdgeX, CORD, OpenEdge, KubeEdge, and ioFog. Right now he is also chairing the APAC session of OSF Edge Computing Working Group.\n\nHe got his PhD degree on Computer Science from Fudan University at Shanghai in 2004, and joined Intel after graduating from the school."
