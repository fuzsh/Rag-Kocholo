Spacecraft observations suggest that flux transfer events and interplanetary magnetic clouds may be associated with magnetic flux ropes which are magnetic flux tubes containing helical magnetic field lines. In the magnetic flux ropes, the azimuthal magnetic field is superposed on the axial field. The time evolution of a localized magnetic flux rope is studied. A two-dimensional compressible MHD simulation code with a cylindrical symmetry is developed to study the wave modes associated with the evolution of flux ropes. It is found that in the initial phase both the fast magnetosonic wave and the Alfven wave are developed in the flux rope. After this initial phase, the Alfven wave becomes the dominant wave mode for the evolution of the magnetic flux rope and the radial expansion velocity of the flux rope is found to be negligible. Numerical results further show that even for a large initial azimuthal component of the magnetic field, the propagation velocity along the axial direction of the flux rope remains the Alfven velocity. It is also found that the localized magnetic flux rope tends to evolve into two separate magnetic ropes propagating in opposite directions. The simulation results are used to study the evolution of magnetic flux ropes associated with flux transfer events observed at the earth's dayside magnetopause and magnetic clouds in the interplanetary space.

The effect of the magnetic topology of the Magnetic Clouds (MCs) over the energetic particle event (EPe) fluxes (0.5-100 MeV) have been simulated. In the data corresponding to the ion and electron fluxes, a depression after a strong maximum is observed when a EPe passes through a MC. Using our cross-section circular and elliptical MC models (Journal of Geophysical Research 107(1), doi:10.1029/2001JA900100 (2002) and Solar Physics 207(1), 187-198 (2002)) we have tried to explain that effect, understanding the importance of the topology of the MC. In sight of the results of the preliminary analysis we conclude that the magnitude of the magnetic field seems not to play a significant role but the helicoidal topology associated with topology of the MCs.

Energetic ion and cosmic ray characteristics of a magnetic cloud

The large interplanetary shock event of February 11, 1982, has yielded ISEE-3 energetic ion and magnetic field data as well as ground-based neutron-monitor cosmic-ray data. The timing and the onset of the Forbush decrease associated with this shock event coincide with the arrival at the earth of its magnetic cloud component; the duration of the decrease, similarly, corresponds to that of the cloud's passage past the earth. The large scattering mean free path readings suggest that while magnetic cloud ions can easily travel along magnetic field lines, they cannot travel across them, so that they cannot escape the cloud after entering it. Similarly, the cloud field lines prevented cosmic ray entrance, and could have prevented their reaching the earth. The cloud is therefore a major basis for the Forbush decrease.

Origin of coronal mass ejection and magnetic cloud: Thermal or magnetic driven?

A fundamental problem in Solar-Terrestrial Physics is the origin of the solar transient plasma output, which includes the coronal mass ejection and its interplanetary manifestation, e.g. the magnetic cloud. The traditional blast wave model resulted from solar thermal pressure impulse has faced with challenge during recent years. In the MHD numerical simulation study of CME, the authors find that the basic feature of the asymmetrical event on 18 August 1980 can be reproduced neither by a thermal pressure nor by a speed increment. Also, the thermal pressure model fails in simulating the interplanetary structure with low thermal pressure and strong magnetic field strength, representative of a typical magnetic cloud. Instead, the numerical simulation results are in favor of the magnetic field expansion as the likely mechanism for both the asymmetrical CME event and magnetic cloud.

The January 10-11, 1997 magnetic cloud event provided a rare opportunity to study auroral energy deposition under varying but intense IMF conditions. The Wind spacecraft located about 100 RE upstream monitored the IMF and plasma parameters during the passing of the cloud. The Polar Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) observed the aurora[ precipitation during the first encounter of the cloud with Earth's magnetosphere and during several subsequent substorm events. The UVI has the unique capability of measuring the energy flux and characteristic energy of the precipitating electrons through the use of narrow band filters that distinguish short and long wavelength molecular nitrogen emissions. The spatial and temporal characteristics of the precipitating electron energy will be discussed beginning with the inception of the event at the Earth early January 1 Oth and continuing through the subsidence of auroral activity on January 11th.

Radiation belt electron observations following the January 1997 magnetic cloud event

Selesnick, R. S.; Blake, J. B.

Relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt associated with the January 1997 magnetic cloud event were observed by the HIST instrument on POLAR at kinetic energies from 0.7 to 7 MeV and L shells from 3 to 9. The electron enhancement occurred on a time scale of hours or less throughout the outer radiation belt, except for a more gradual rise in the higher energy electrons at the lower L values indicative of local acceleration and inward radial diffusion. At the higher L values, variations on a time scale of several days following the initial injection on January 10 are consistent with data from geosynchronous orbit and may be an adiabatic response.

We have simulated the effect of the magnetic topology of the Magnetic Clouds (MCs) over the solar energetic particle event (SEPe) fluxes (0.5-100 MeV) provided by solar flares. When a SEPe passes through a MC a characteristic behaviour in the data corresponding to the ion and electron fluxes is observed: a depression after a strong maximum of the flux. Using our cross-section circular and elliptical MC models we have tried to explain that effect, understanding the importance of the topology of the MC.

We aimed at understanding the common characteristics of magnetic clouds, relevant to solar-interplanetary connections, but exceptional ones were noted and are stressed here through a short compendium. The study is based on analyses of 28 good or better events (Out of 33 candidates) as identified in WIND magnetic field and plasma data. These cloud intervals are provided by WIND-MFI's Website under the URL (http://lepmfi.gsfc.nasa.gov/mfi/mag_cloud_publ.html#table). The period covered is from early 1995 to November 1998. A force free, cylindrically symmetric, magnetic field model has been applied to the field data in usually 1-hour averaged form for the cloud analyses. Some of the findings are: (1) one small duration event turned out to have an approximately normal size which was due to a distant almost "skimming" passage by the spacecraft; (2) One truly small event was observed, where 10 min averages had to be used in the model fitting; it had an excellent model fit and the usual properties of a magnetic cloud, except it possessed a small axial magnetic flux; (3) One cloud ha a dual axial-field-polarity, in the sense that the "core" had one polarity and the annular region around it had an opposite polarity. This event also satisfied the model and with a ve3ry good chi-squared value. Some others show a hint of this dual polarity; (4) The temporal distribution of occurrence clouds over the 4 years show a dip in 1996; (5) About 50 % of the clouds had upstream shocks; any others had upstream pressure pulses; (6) The overall average speed (390 km/s) of the best 28 events is less than the normally quoted for the average solar wind speed (420 km/s) The average of central cloud speed to the upstream solar wind speed was not much greater than one (1.08), even though many of these clouds were drivers of interplanetary shocks. Cloud expansion is partly the reason for the existence of upstream shocks; (7) The cloud axes often (about 50 % of the time) revealed reasonable

A list of 33 magnetic clouds as identified in WIND magnetic field and plasma data has been compiled. The intervals for these events are provided as part of NASA/GSFC, WIND-MFI's Website under the URL http://lepmfi.qsfc.nasa.gov/mfi/mag_cloud publ.html#table The period covered in this study is from early 1995 to November 1998 which primarily occurs in the quiet part of the solar cycle. A force free, cylindrically symmetric, magnetic field model has been applied to the field data in 1-hour averaged form for all of these events (except one small event where 10 min avg's were used) and the resulting fit-parameters examined. Each event was provided a semi-quantitatively determined quality factor (excellent, good or poor). A set of 28 good or better cases, spanning a surprisingly large range of values for its various properties, was used for further analysis. These properties are, for example, durations, attitudes, sizes, asymmetries, axial field strengths, speeds, and relative impact parameters. They will be displayed and analyzed, along with some related derived quantities, with emphasis on typical vs unusual properties and on the magnetic fields magnetic clouds' relationships to the Sun and to upstream interplanetary shocks, where possible. For example, it is remarkable how narrowly distributed the speeds of these clouds are, and the overall average speed (390 techniques km/s) is less than that normally quoted for the average solar wind speed (420 km/s) despite the fact that many of these clouds are d"drivers" of interplanetary shocks. On average, a cloud appears to be a little less symmetric when the spacecraft is able to pass close to the cloud's axis as compared to a farther out passage. The average longitude and latitude (in GSE) of the axes of the clouds are 85 degrees and 8 degrees, respectively, with standard deviations near 40 degrees. Also, the half=yearly averaged axial magnetic flux has approximately tripled. almost monotonically, from about 6 to 17 X 10

On 14-15 January 1988, a magnetic cloud with a local field topology consistent with an east-west aligned cylindrical flux-rope and which formed the driver of an interplanetary shock passed the earth. Using 0.5-4 MeV/n ion data from the instrument on IMP 8, the paper addresses the question of whether or not magnetic field lines within the magnetic cloud were connected to the sun. An impulsive solar particle event was detected inside the magnetic cloud strongly suggesting that the field lines were rooted at the sun.

A model for the behaviour of the Solar Energetic Particle Events inside Magnetic Clouds

The modulation effects of the solar ejecta over the solar energetic particle event SEPe fluxes (0,5-100 MeV) provided by solar flares have recently been highlighted. Especially important is the behaviour of these fluxes inside MCs where, in spite of the low magnetic field intensities of these interplanetary structures (about 30 nT), a decrease in the population of the energetic particles is observed. In the present work it is shown a simple theoretical model we have developed to analyse the behaviour of those fluxes inside the magnetic clouds (MCs) using, as a starting point, our previous magnetic field model for MCs. The experimental data from ACE, GOES, SAMPEX, SOHO, Ulysses and WIND satellites are presented, both from MC coincident with SEPe and not coincident.

The energetic charged particle, interplanetary magnetic field, and plasma characteristics of the 'Bastille Day' shock and ejecta/magnetic cloud events at 1 AU occurring over the days 14-16 July 2000 are described. Profiles of MeV (WIND/LEMT) energetic ions help to organize the overall sequence of events from the solar source to 1 AU. Stressed are analyses of an outstanding magnetic cloud (MC2) starting late on 15 July and its upstream shock about 4 hours earlier in WIND magnetic field and plasma data. Also analyzed is a less certain, but likely, magnetic cloud (MC1) occurring early on 15 July; this was separated from MC2 by its upstream shock and many heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings. Other HCS crossings occurred throughout the 3-day period. Overall this dramatic series of interplanetary events caused a large multi-phase magnetic storm with min Dst lower than -300 nT. The very fast solar wind speed (greater than or equal to 1100 km/s) in and around the front of MC2 (for near average densities) was responsible for a very high solar wind ram pressure driving in the front of the magnetosphere to geocentric distances estimated to be as low as approx. 5 R(sub E), much lower than the geosynchronous orbit radius. This was consistent with magnetic field observations from two GOES satellites which indicated they were in the magnetosheath for extended times. A static force free field model is used to fit the two magnetic cloud profiles providing estimates of the clouds' physical and geometrical properties. MC2 was much larger than MCI, but their axes were nearly antiparallel, and their magnetic fields had the same left-handed helicity. MC2's axis and its upstream shock normal were very close to being perpendicular to each other, as might be expected if the cloud were driving the shock at the time of observation. The estimated axial magnetic flux carried by MC2 was 52 x 10(exp 20) Mx, which is about 5 times the typical magnetic flux estimated for other magnetic

Magnetic flux rope (MFR) is the core structure of the greatest eruptions, that is, the coronal mass ejections (CMEs), on the Sun, and magnetic clouds are posteruption MFRs in interplanetary space. There is a strong debate about whether or not a MFR exists prior to a CME and how the MFR forms/grows through magnetic reconnection during the eruption. Here we report a rare event, in which a magnetic cloud was observed sequentially by four spacecraft near Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, respectively. With the aids of a uniform-twist flux rope model and a newly developed method that can recover a shock-compressed structure, we find that the axial magnetic flux and helicity of the magnetic cloud decreased when it propagated outward but the twist increased. Our analysis suggests that the "pancaking" effect and "erosion" effect may jointly cause such variations. The significance of the pancaking effect is difficult to be estimated, but the signature of the erosion can be found as the imbalance of the azimuthal flux of the cloud. The latter implies that the magnetic cloud was eroded significantly leaving its inner core exposed to the solar wind at far distance. The increase of the twist together with the presence of the erosion effect suggests that the posteruption MFR may have a high-twist core enveloped by a less-twisted outer shell. These results pose a great challenge to the current understanding on the solar eruptions as well as the formation and instability of MFRs.

Study of an expanding magnetic cloud

Nakwacki, M. S.; Dasso, S.; Mandrini, C. H.; DÃ©moulin, P.

Magnetic Clouds (MCs) transport into the interplanetary medium the magnetic flux and helicity released in coronal mass ejections by the Sun. At 1 AU from the Sun, MCs are generally modelled as static flux ropes. However, the velocity profile of some MCs presents signatures of expansion. We analise here the magnetic structure of an expanding magnetic cloud observed by Wind spacecraft. We consider a dynamical model, based on a self-similar behaviour for the cloud radial velocity. We assume a free expansion for the cloud, and a cylindrical linear force free field (i.e., the Lundquist's field) as the initial condition for its magnetic configuration. We derive theoretical expressions for the magnetic flux across a surface perpendicular to the cloud axis, for the magnetic helicity and magnetic energy per unit length along the tube using the self-similar model. Finally, we compute these magntitudes with the fitted parameters. FULL TEXT IN SPANISH

Characteristics of magnetic clouds/magnetic-cloud-like structures during the years 1995-2003

Wu, C. C.; Lepping, R.

Using nine years of solar wind plasma and magnetic field data we investigated the characteristics of both magnetic clouds MCs and magnetic cloud like structures MCLs during 1995-2003 A MCL structure is an event which was identified by an automatic scheme Lepping et al 2005 with the same criteria as for a MC but is not identifiable as a flux rope by using the MC Burlaga 1981 fitting model developed by Lepping et al 1990 The average occurrence rate is sim 9 5 for MCs and sim 13 6 for MCLs per year for the overall period of interest and there were 82 MCs and 122 MCLs identified during this period The characteristics of MCs and MCL structures are as follows 1 The averaged duration Dt of MCs is 21 1 hour which is 40 longer than MCLs Dt 15 hrs 2 The averaged Bz min minimum Bz found in MC MCL is -10 2 nT for MCs and -6 nT for MCLs 3 The averaged Dst min minimum Dst caused by MC MCL is -82 nT for MCs and -37 nT for MCLs 4 The average of the solar wind velocity is 453 km s for MCs and 413 km s for MCLs 5 The average of the thermal speed is 24 6 km s for MCs and 27 7 km s for MCLs 6 The average of the magnetic field intensity is 12 7 nT for MCs and 9 8 nT for MCLs and 7 The average of the solar wind density is 9 4 cm -3 for MCs and 6 3 cm -3 for MCLs The longer duration more intense magnetic field and higher solar wind speed and denisty of MCs compared to those of the MCLs might be the major reason for generally causing geomagnetic storms with higher

Magnetic flux rope versus the spheromak as models for interplanetary magnetic clouds

Magnetic clouds form a subset of interplanetary ejecta with well-defined magnetic and thermodynamic properties. Observationally, it is well established that magnetic clouds expand as they propagate antisunward. The aim of this paper is to compare and contrast two models which have been proposed for the global magnetic field line topology of magnetic clouds: a magnetic flux tube geometry, on the one hand, and a spheromak geometry (including possible higher multiples), on the other. Traditionally, the magnetic structure of magnetic clouds has been modeled by force-free configurations. In a first step, we therefore analyze the ability of static force-free models to account for the asymmetries observed in the magnetic field profiles of magnetic clouds. For a cylindrical flux tube the magnetic field remains symmetric about closest approach to the magnetic axis on all spacecraft orbits intersecting it, whereas in a spheromak geometry one can have asymmetries in the magnetic field signatures along some spacecraft trajectories. The duration of typical magnetic cloud encounters at 1 AU (1 to 2 days) is comparable to their travel time from the Sun to 1 AU and thus magnetic clouds should be treated as strongly nonstationary objects. In a second step, therefore, we abandon the static approach and model magnetic clouds as self-similarly evolving MHD configurations. In our theory, the interaction of the expanding magnetic cloud with the ambient plasma is taken into account by a drag force proportional to the density and the velocity of expansion. Solving rigorously the full set of MHD equations, we demonstrate that the asymmetry in the magnetic signature may arise solely as a result of expansion. Using asymptotic solutions of the MHD equations, we least squares fit both theoretical models to interplanetary data. We find that while the central part of the magnetic cloud is adequately described by both models, the 'edges' of the cloud data are modeled better by the magnetic flux

Magnetic clouds, helicity conservation, and intrinsic scale flux ropes

NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)

Kumar, A.; Rust, D. M.

1995-01-01

An intrinsic-scale flux-rope model for interplanetary magnetic clouds, incorporating conservation of magnetic helicity, flux and mass is found to adequately explain clouds' average thermodynamic and magnetic properties. In spite their continuous expansion as they balloon into interplanetary space, magnetic clouds maintain high temperatures. This is shown to be due to magnetic energy dissipation. The temperature of an expanding cloud is shown to pass through a maximum above its starting temperature if the initial plasma beta in the cloud is less than 2/3. Excess magnetic pressure inside the cloud is not an important driver of the expansion as it is almost balanced by the tension in the helical field lines. It is conservation of magnetic helicity and flux that requires that clouds expand radially as they move away from the Sun. Comparison with published data shows good agreement between measured cloud properties and theory. Parameters determined from theoretical fits to the data, when extended back to the Sun, are consistent with the origin of interplanetary magnetic clouds in solar filament eruptions. A possible extension of the heating mechanism discussed here to heating of the solar corona is discussed.

When a micron-sized magnetizable particle is introduced into a suspension of nanosized magnetic particles, the nanoparticles accumulate around the microparticle and form thick anisotropic clouds extended in the direction of the applied magnetic field. This phenomenon promotes colloidal stabilization of bimodal magnetic suspensions and allows efficient magnetic separation of nanoparticles used in bioanalysis and water purification. In the present work, the size and shape of nanoparticle clouds under the simultaneous action of an external uniform magnetic field and the flow have been studied in detail. In experiments, a dilute suspension of iron oxide nanoclusters (of a mean diameter of 60 nm) was pushed through a thin slit channel with the nickel microspheres (of a mean diameter of 50 Î¼m) attached to the channel wall. The behavior of nanocluster clouds was observed in the steady state using an optical microscope. In the presence of strong enough flow, the size of the clouds monotonically decreases with increasing flow speed in both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields. This is qualitatively explained by enhancement of hydrodynamic forces washing the nanoclusters away from the clouds. In the longitudinal field, the flow induces asymmetry of the front and the back clouds. To explain the flow and the field effects on the clouds, we have developed a simple model based on the balance of the stresses and particle fluxes on the cloud surface. This model, applied to the case of the magnetic field parallel to the flow, captures reasonably well the flow effect on the size and shape of the cloud and reveals that the only dimensionless parameter governing the cloud size is the ratio of hydrodynamic-to-magnetic forcesâthe Mason number. At strong magnetic interactions considered in the present work (dipolar coupling parameter Î± â¥2), the Brownian motion seems not to affect the cloud behavior.

Filament formation in wind-cloud interactions- II. Clouds with turbulent density, velocity, and magnetic fields

We present a set of numerical experiments designed to systematically investigate how turbulence and magnetic fields influence the morphology, energetics, and dynamics of filaments produced in wind-cloud interactions. We cover 3D, magnetohydrodynamic systems of supersonic winds impacting clouds with turbulent density, velocity, and magnetic fields. We find that lognormal density distributions aid shock propagation through clouds, increasing their velocity dispersion and producing filaments with expanded cross-sections and highly magnetized knots and subfilaments. In self-consistently turbulent scenarios, the ratio of filament to initial cloud magnetic energy densities is â¼1. The effect of Gaussian velocity fields is bound to the turbulence Mach number: Supersonic velocities trigger a rapid cloud expansion; subsonic velocities only have a minor impact. The role of turbulent magnetic fields depends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the stronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the greater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Overall, we show that including turbulence and magnetic fields is crucial to understanding cold gas entrainment in multiphase winds. While cloud porosity and supersonic turbulence enhance the acceleration of clouds, magnetic shielding protects them from ablation and causes Rayleigh-Taylor-driven subfilamentation. Wind-swept clouds in turbulent models reach distances â¼15-20 times their core radius and acquire bulk speeds â¼0.3-0.4 of the wind speed in one cloud-crushing time, which are three times larger than in non-turbulent models. In all simulations, the ratio of turbulent magnetic to kinetic energy densities asymptotes at â¼0.1-0.4, and convergence of all relevant dynamical properties requires at least 64 cells per cloud radius.

Stable Low Cloud Phase II: Nocturnal Event Study

This report describes the work done by the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) in developing a database of nights that experienced rapid (< 90 minutes) low cloud formation in a stable atmosphere, resulting in ceilings at the Shuttle Landing Facility (TTS) that violated Space Shuttle Flight Rules (FR). This work is the second phase of a similar AMU task that examined the same phenomena during the day. In the first phase of this work, the meteorological conditions favoring the rapid formation of low ceilings include the presence of any inversion below 8000 ft, high relative humidity (RH) beneath the inversion and a clockwise turning of the winds from the surface to the middle troposphere (-15000 ft). The AMU compared and contrasted the atmospheric and thermodynamic conditions between nights with rapid low ceiling formation and nights with low ceilings resulting from other mechanisms. The AMU found that there was little to discern between the rapidly-forming ceiling nights and other low ceiling nights at TTS. When a rapid development occurred, the average RH below the inversions was 87% while non-events had an average RH of 79%. One key parameter appeared to be the vertical wind profile in the Cape Canaveral, FL radiosonde (XMR) sounding. Eighty-three percent of the rapid development events had veering winds with height from the surface to the middle troposphere (-15,000 ft) while 61% of the non-events had veering winds with height. Veering winds indicate a warm-advection regime, which supports large-scale rising motion and ultimately cloud formation in a moist environment. However, only six of the nights (out of 86 events examined) with low cloud ceilings had an occurrence of rapidly developing ceilings. Since only 7% rapid development events were observed in this dataset, it is likely that rapid low cloud development is not a common occurrence during the night, or at least not as common as during the day. In the AMU work on the daytime rapid low cloud development (Case

Magnetic clouds are among the most geoeffective solar events capable to trigger strong magnetic storms in the terrestrial magnetosphere. However, their characteristics and those of the surrounding media are not always capable to explain their high level of geoeffectivity. From observations and simulations, we investigate here the role of the bow shock and of the magnetosheath. Conjugated observations upstream (ACE) and downstream (CLUSTER) of the bow shock show that the magnetic clouds' magnetic structure in the magnetosheath can strongly depart from their pristine structure upstream of the bow shock. This modification depends on the shock configuration (quasi-perpendicular, quasi-parallel). We also discuss this question from hybrid simulations of the interaction of magnetic clouds with the bow shock. We show that this interaction may produce unexpected characteristics in the magnetosheath, such as asymmetric distributions of magnetic field, density, temperature, velocity. They thus lead to interactions with the magnetosphere which were not expected from the pristine characteristics of the magnetic clouds in the solar wind upstream of bow shock. We here discuss the effects of such an asymmetric magnetosheath on key parameters for the interaction with the magnetopause (reconnection, instabilities), responsible in turn for the development of geomagnetic activity inside the magnetosphere.

The rapid access of SEPs to the interiors of many clouds indicates that the cloud field lines extend back to the sun and hence are not plasmoids. The small modulation of galactic cosmic rays associated with clouds also suggests that the magnetic fields of clouds are not closed.

We modeled the long-term and small-scale evolution of molecular clouds using direct 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. This work followed up on previous research by our group under auspices of the ATP in which we studied the energetics of turbulent, magnetized clouds and their internal structure on intermediate scales. Our new work focused on both global and smallscale aspects of the evolution of turbulent, magnetized clouds, and in particular studied the response of turbulent proto-cloud material to passage through the Galactic spiral potential, and the dynamical collapse of turbulent, magnetized (supercritical) clouds into fragments to initiate the formation of a stellar cluster. Technical advances under this program include developing an adaptive-mesh MHD code as a successor to ZEUS (ATHENA) in order to follow cloud fragmentation, developing a shearing-sheet MHD code which includes self-gravity and externally-imposed gravity to follow the evolution of clouds in the Galactic potential, and developing radiative transfer models to evaluate the internal ionization of clumpy clouds exposed to external photoionizing UV and CR radiation. Gammie's work at UIUC focused on the radiative transfer aspects of this program.

We have suggested a model of magnetic cloud presented as a torus with magnetic flux rope structure situated inside the interplanetary corona mass ejecta expanding radially away from the Sun through the interplanetary medium. The magnetic field of the torus changing during its propagation has been obtained. The magnetic cloud â solar wind boundary transparency for cosmic rays with different energies depending on the cloud orientation and properties of the torus magnetic field has been determined by means of calculation of the particle trajectories at the boundary.

1997-01-01

In order to better understand the solar origins of magnetic clouds, statistical distributions of the estimated axial magnetic flux of 30 magnetic clouds at 1 AU, separated according to their occurrence during the solar cycle, were obtained and a comparison was made of the magnetic flux of a magnetic cloud to the aggregate flux of apparently associated photospheric magnetic flux tubes, for some specific cases. The 30 magnetic clouds comprise 12 cases from WIND, and the remainder from IMP-8, earlier IMPs, the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) 3 and HELIOS. The total magnetic flux along the cloud axis was estimated using a constant alpha, cylindrical, force-free flux rope model to determine cloud diameter and axial magentic field strength. The distribution of magentic fluxes for the 30 clouds is shown to be in the form of a skewed Gaussian.

The dynamics of radially expanding magnetic clouds is rigorously analyzed within the framework of ideal MHD. The cloud is modelled as a cylindrically symmetric magnetic flux rope. In the force balance we include the gas pressure gradient and the Lorentz force. Interaction with the ambient solar wind due to expansion of the magnetic cloud is represented by a drag force proportional to the bulk velocity. We consider the self-similar expansion of a polytrope, and reduce the problem to an ordinary nonlinear differential equation for the evolution function. Analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the evolution function, we formulate theoretical expectations for the long-term behavior of cloud parameters. We focus on the temporal evolution of (1) the magnetic field strength; (2) the twist of the field lines; (3) the asymmetry of the total field profile; and (4) the bulk flow speed. We present data from two magnetic clouds observed at 1 AU and 2 AU, respectively, and find good agreement with theoretical expectations. For a peak magnetic field strength at 1 AU of 25 nT and a polytropic index of 0.5, we find that a magnetic cloud can be distinguished from the background interplanetary field up to a distance of about 5 AU. Taking larger magnetic fields and bigger polytropic indices this distance can double.

Fragmentation of a Filamentary Cloud Permeated by a Perpendicular Magnetic Field

DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)

Hanawa, Tomoyuki; Kudoh, Takahiro; Tomisaka, Kohji

We examine the linear stability of an isothermal filamentary cloud permeated by a perpendicular magnetic field. Our model cloud is assumed to be supported by gas pressure against self-gravity in the unperturbed state. For simplicity, the density distribution is assumed to be symmetric around the axis. Also for simplicity, the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform, and turbulence is not taken into account. The perturbation equation is formulated to be an eigenvalue problem. The growth rate is obtained as a function of the wavenumber for fragmentation along the axis and the magnetic field strength. The growth rate dependsmoreÂ Â» critically on the outer boundary. If the displacement vanishes in regions very far from the cloud axis (fixed boundary), cloud fragmentation is suppressed by a moderate magnetic field, which means the plasma beta is below 1.67 on the cloud axis. If the displacement is constant along the magnetic field in regions very far from the cloud, the cloud is unstable even when the magnetic field is infinitely strong. The cloud is deformed by circulation in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. The unstable mode is not likely to induce dynamical collapse, since it is excited even when the whole cloud is magnetically subcritical. For both boundary conditions, the magnetic field increases the wavelength of the most unstable mode. We find that the magnetic force suppresses compression perpendicular to the magnetic field especially in regions of low density.Â«Â less

The first in situ observation of torsional AlfvÃ©n waves during the interaction of large-scale magnetic clouds

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Raghav, Anil N.; Kule, Ankita

2018-05-01

The large-scale magnetic cloud such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is the fundamental driver of the space weather. The interaction of the multiple-CMEs in interplanetary space affects their dynamic evolution and geo-effectiveness. The complex and merged multiple magnetic clouds appear as the in situ signature of the interacting CMEs. The AlfvÃ©n waves are speculated to be one of the major possible energy exchange/dissipation mechanism during the interaction. However, no such observational evidence has been found in the literature. The case studies of CME-CME collision events suggest that the magnetic and thermal energy of the CME is converted into the kinetic energy. Moreover, magnetic reconnection process is justified to be responsible for merging of multiple magnetic clouds. Here, we present unambiguous evidence of sunward torsional AlfvÃ©n waves in the interacting region after the super-elastic collision of multiple CMEs. The WalÃ©n relation is used to confirm the presence of AlfvÃ©n waves in the interacting region of multiple CMEs/magnetic clouds. We conclude that AlfvÃ©n waves and magnetic reconnection are the possible energy exchange/dissipation mechanisms during large-scale magnetic clouds collisions. This study has significant implications not only in CME-magnetosphere interactions but also in the interstellar medium where interactions of large-scale magnetic clouds are possible.

Electron Cloud Trapping in Recycler Combined Function Dipole Magnets

Antipov, Sergey A.; Nagaitsev, S.

2016-10-04

Electron cloud can lead to a fast instability in intense proton and positron beams in circular accelerators. In the Fermilab Recycler the electron cloud is confined within its combined function magnets. We show that the field of combined function magnets traps the electron cloud, present the results of analytical estimates of trapping, and compare them to numerical simulations of electron cloud formation. The electron cloud is located at the beam center and up to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since the process of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount of electronsmoreÂ Â» significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next revolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multiturn accumulation allows the electron cloud reaching final intensities orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole. The multi-turn build-up can be stopped by injection of a clearing bunch of 1010 p at any position in the ring.Â«Â less

Scalable and responsive event processing in the cloud

Suresh, Visalakshmi; Ezhilchelvan, Paul; Watson, Paul

2013-01-01

Event processing involves continuous evaluation of queries over streams of events. Response-time optimization is traditionally done over a fixed set of nodes and/or by using metrics measured at query-operator levels. Cloud computing makes it easy to acquire and release computing nodes as required. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a novel, queueing-theory-based approach for meeting specified response-time targets against fluctuating event arrival rates by drawing only the necessary amount of computing resources from a cloud platform. In the proposed approach, the entire processing engine of a distinct query is modelled as an atomic unit for predicting response times. Several such units hosted on a single node are modelled as a multiple class M/G/1 system. These aspects eliminate intrusive, low-level performance measurements at run-time, and also offer portability and scalability. Using model-based predictions, cloud resources are efficiently used to meet response-time targets. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through cloud-based experiments. PMID:23230164

Cloud rise model for radiological dispersal devices events

As a part of the preparedness and response to possible radiological terror events, it is important to model the evolution of the radioactive cloud immediately after its formation, as a function of time, explosive quantity and local meteorological conditions. One of the major outputs of a cloud rise models is the evaluation of cloud top height, which is an essential input for most of the succeeding atmospheric dispersion models. This parameter strongly affects the radiological consequences of the event. Most of the cloud rise models used today, have been developed according to experiments were large quantities of explosives were used, within the range of hundreds of kilograms of TNT. The majority of these models, however, fail to address Radiological Dispersion Devices (RDD) events, which are typically characterized by smaller amounts of TNT. In this paper, a new, semi-empirical model that describes the vertical evolution of the cloud up to its effective height as a function of time, explosive quantity, atmospheric stability and horizontal wind speed, is presented. The database for this model is taken from five sets of experiments done in Israel during 2006-2009 under the "Green Field" (GF) project, using 0.25-100 kg of TNT.

Simultaneous observations of solar MeV particles in a magnetic cloud and in the earth's northern tail lobe - Implications for the global field line topology of magnetic clouds and for the entry of solar particles into the magnetosphere during cloud passage

Simultaneous ISEE 3 and IMP 8 spacecraft observations of magnetic fields and flow anisotropies of solar energetic protons and electrons during the passage of an interplanetary magnetic cloud show various particle signature differences at the two spacecraft. These differences are interpretable in terms of the magnetic line topology of the cloud, the connectivity of the cloud field lines to the solar surface, and the interconnection between the magnetic fields of the magnetic clouds and of the earth. These observations are consistent with a magnetic cloud model in which these mesoscale configurations are curved magnetic flux ropes attached at both ends to the sun's surface, extending out to 1 AU.

Galactic Cosmic Ray Intensity Response to Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections/Magnetic Clouds in 1995-2009

Richardson, I. G.; Cane, H. V.

2011-01-01

We summarize the response of the galactic cosmic ray (CGR) intensity to the passage of the more than 300 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks that passed the Earth during 1995-2009, a period that encompasses the whole of Solar Cycle 23. In approx.80% of cases, the GCR intensity decreased during the passage of these structures, i.e., a "Forbush decrease" occurred, while in approx.10% there was no significant change. In the remaining cases, the GCR intensity increased. Where there was an intensity decrease, minimum intensity was observed inside the ICME in approx.90% of these events. The observations confirm the role of both post-shock regions and ICMEs in the generation of these decreases, consistent with many previous studies, but contrary to the conclusion of Reames, Kahler, and Tylka (Astrophys. 1. Lett. 700, L199, 2009) who, from examining a subset of ICMEs with flux-rope-like magnetic fields (magnetic clouds) argued that these are "open structures" that allow free access of particles including GCRs to their interior. In fact, we find that magnetic clouds are more likely to participate in the deepest GCR decreases than ICMEs that are not magnetic clouds.

An analytical solution for a potential magnetic field with arbitrary intensity around a toroidal magnetic cloud has been found. The background external field may have a gradient. The solution is used for calculation of magnetic cloud propagation. Obtained velocity profiles show a good agreement with in situ observations near the Earth's orbit.

Helical magnetic fields in molecular clouds?. A new method to determine the line-of-sight magnetic field structure in molecular clouds

Context. Magnetic fields pervade in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are believed to be important in the process of star formation, yet probing magnetic fields in star formation regions is challenging. Aims: We propose a new method to use Faraday rotation measurements in small-scale star forming regions to find the direction and magnitude of the component of magnetic field along the line of sight. We test the proposed method in four relatively nearby regions of Orion A, Orion B, Perseus, and California. Methods: We use rotation measure data from the literature. We adopt a simple approach based on relative measurements to estimate the rotation measure due to the molecular clouds over the Galactic contribution. We then use a chemical evolution code along with extinction maps of each cloud to find the electron column density of the molecular cloud at the position of each rotation measure data point. Combining the rotation measures produced by the molecular clouds and the electron column density, we calculate the line-of-sight magnetic field strength and direction. Results: In California and Orion A, we find clear evidence that the magnetic fields at one side of these filamentary structures are pointing towards us and are pointing away from us at the other side. Even though the magnetic fields in Perseus might seem to suggest the same behavior, not enough data points are available to draw such conclusions. In Orion B, as well, there are not enough data points available to detect such behavior. This magnetic field reversal is consistent with a helical magnetic field morphology. In the vicinity of available Zeeman measurements in OMC-1, OMC-B, and the dark cloud Barnard 1, we find magnetic field values of - 23 Â± 38 Î¼G, - 129 Â± 28 Î¼G, and 32 Â± 101 Î¼G, respectively, which are in agreement with the Zeeman measurements.

The eastern Pacific El NiÃ±o event in 2006-2007 and the central Pacific El NiÃ±o event during 2009-2010 exhibit opposite responses in the top of atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effects. These responses are driven by differences in large-scale circulation that result in significant low cloud anomalies in the subtropical southeastern Pacific. Both the vertical profile of cloud fraction and cloud water content are reduced during the eastern Pacific El NiÃ±o; however, the shift in the distribution of cloud characteristics and the physical processes underlying these changes need further analysis. The NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS) Clouds and Radiation Working Group will use a synthesis of NEWS data products, A-Train satellite measurements, reanalysis, and modeling approaches to further explore the differences in the low cloud response to changes in the large-scale forcing, as well as try to understand the physical mechanism driving the observed changes in the low clouds for the 2006/07 and 2009/10 distinct El NiÃ±o events. The distributions of cloud macrophysical, microphysical, and radiative properties over the southeast Pacific will first be compared for these two events using a combination of MODIS, CloudSat/CALIPSO, and CERES data. Satellite and reanalysis estimates of changes in the vertical temperature and moisture profiles, lower tropospheric stability, winds, and surface heat fluxes are then used to identify the drivers for observed differences in the clouds and TOA radiative effects.

MAGNETIZED GAS IN THE SMITH HIGH VELOCITY CLOUD

DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)

Hill, Alex S.; McClure-Griffiths, Naomi M.; Mao, S. A.

2013-11-01

We report the first detection of magnetic fields associated with the Smith High Velocity Cloud. We use a catalog of Faraday rotation measures toward extragalactic radio sources behind the Smith Cloud, new H I observations from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and a spectroscopic map of HÎ± from the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper Northern Sky Survey. There are enhancements in rotation measure (RM) of â100 rad m{sup â2} which are generally well correlated with decelerated HÎ± emission. We estimate a lower limit on the line-of-sight component of the field of â8 Î¼G along a decelerated filament; this is amoreÂ Â» lower limit due to our assumptions about the geometry. No RM excess is evident in sightlines dominated by H I or HÎ± at the velocity of the Smith Cloud. The smooth HÎ± morphology of the emission at the Smith Cloud velocity suggests photoionization by the Galactic ionizing radiation field as the dominant ionization mechanism, while the filamentary morphology and high (â1 Rayleigh) HÎ± intensity of the lower-velocity magnetized ionized gas suggests an ionization process associated with shocks due to interaction with the Galactic interstellar medium. The presence of the magnetic field may contribute to the survival of high velocity clouds like the Smith Cloud as they move from the Galactic halo to the disk. We expect these data to provide a test for magnetohydrodynamic simulations of infalling gas.Â«Â less

Characteristics of magnetised plasma flow around stationary and expanding magnetic clouds

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Dalakishvili, Giorgi

Studies of interplanetary magnetic clouds have shown that the characteristics of the region ahead of these objects, which are moving away from the Sun in the solar wind, play a role in determining their geo-efficiency, i.e. the kind and the degree of their effects on the Earth environment. Therefore, our main goal is to model and study the plasma parameters in the vicinity of interplanetary magnetic clouds. To this end we present a model in which the magnetic clouds are immersed in a magnetised plasma flow with a homogeneous magnetic field. We first calculate the resulting distortion of the external magnetic field and then determine the plasma velocity by employing the frozen-in condition. Subsequently, the plasma density and pressure are expressed as functions of the magnetic field and the velocity field. The plasma flow parameters are determined by solving the time-independent ideal MHD equations for both the stationary regime and for the case of an expand-ing cylindrical magnetic cloud, thus extending previous results that appeared in the literature.

Filamentary flow and magnetic geometry in evolving cluster-forming molecular cloud clumps

Klassen, Mikhail; Pudritz, Ralph E.; Kirk, Helen

2017-02-01

We present an analysis of the relationship between the orientation of magnetic fields and filaments that form in 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of cluster-forming, turbulent molecular cloud clumps. We examine simulated cloud clumps with size scales of L Ë 2-4 pc and densities of n Ë 400-1000 cm-3 with AlfvÃ©n Mach numbers near unity. We simulated two cloud clumps of different masses, one in virial equilibrium, the other strongly gravitationally bound, but with the same initial turbulent velocity field and similar mass-to-flux ratio. We apply various techniques to analyse the filamentary and magnetic structure of the resulting cloud, including the DISPERSE filament-finding algorithm in 3D. The largest structure that forms is a 1-2 parsec-long filament, with smaller connecting sub-filaments. We find that our simulated clouds, wherein magnetic forces and turbulence are comparable, coherent orientation of the magnetic field depends on the virial parameter. Sub-virial clumps undergo strong gravitational collapse and magnetic field lines are dragged with the accretion flow. We see evidence of filament-aligned flow and accretion flow on to the filament in the sub-virial cloud. Magnetic fields oriented more parallel in the sub-virial cloud and more perpendicular in the denser, marginally bound cloud. Radiative feedback from a 16 Mâ star forming in a cluster in one of our simulation's ultimately results in the destruction of the main filament, the formation of an H II region, and the sweeping up of magnetic fields within an expanding shell at the edges of the H II region.

A comparative study of dynamically expanding force-free, constant-alpha magnetic configurations with applications to magnetic clouds

1992-01-01

We contrast two different solutions of the constant alpha, force-free MHD equation, both of which have been suggested as models for magnetic clouds: a solution in cylindrical coordinates and one in spherical coordinates. In line with the observation that magnetic clouds expand, we generalize these static models and construct their expanding counterparts. We find that expansion introduces in both cases a large asymmetry in the field strength signature which is in the same sense as that seen the the data, i.e. towards the leading edge of the cloud. We then do a least squares fit of the respective models to one-spacecraft data on a magnetic cloud. We find that the fitting routine converges in both cases. However, while purely formally we cannot distinguish between the two models using data from one spacecraft, the field components in the 'spherical' model have features not compatible with data on magnetic clouds.

A Statistical Study of the Magnetic Structure of Magnetic Clouds Downstream of the Earth's Bow Shock

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Turc, L.; Fontaine, D.; Kilpua, E.; Escoubet, C. P.

2015-12-01

Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large-scale solar wind transients characterized primarily by an enhanced and smoothly-rotating magnetic field over periods of the order of one day. They are the drivers of the most intense geomagnetic storms, therefore understanding their interaction with the Earth's environment is of major interest for space weather forecasting. The first steps of this complex chain of processes are their interaction with the terrestrial bow shock and the ensuing propagation in the magnetosheath. Recent studies have shown that under certain conditions the distinctive magnetic structure of MCs can be significantly altered downstream of the bow shock. In such case, the magnetic field impinging on the magnetosphere strongly differs from that in the upstream solar wind and could lead to a reconnection pattern very different from that expected from the solar wind observations. The aim of the present work is to substantiate and generalize these results, obtained from a few MC events, in performing a statistical study. For this purpose, a comprehensive database of MC events, covering about 15 years of data, from 2000 to 2014, has been compiled. It lists presently 151 MCs observed in L1 by either Wind or ACE. Using the events during which spacecraft observations in the magnetosheath are simultaneously available, we investigate the evolution of the magnetic structure of MCs from the solar wind to the magnetosheath. The influence of the upstream solar wind parameters, such as the plasma beta, the Alfven Mach number or the magnetic field strength, is examined. Using a semi-analytical model, we estimate the local shock properties encountered upon entering the magnetosheath and find that the alteration of the magnetic structure of MCs strongly depend on the shock geometry. The large dataset allows us to assess the limitations of the magnetosheath model. The consequences of our results in terms of the geoeffectivity of MCs are discussed.

The heliospheric sector boundary as a distented magnetic cloud

NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)

Crooker, N. U.; Intriligator, D. S.

1995-01-01

A magnetic cloud was detected both near Earth and by Pioneer 11 located 43 deg east of Earth at 4.8 AU. The magnetic field within the cloud rotated smoothly from toward to away polarity, marking sector boundary passage. Interpreted as a flux rope, the cloud had a vertical axis, implying that its cylindrical cross-section in the ecliptic plane was distended along the sector boundary by at least 43, forming an extensive occlusion in the heliospheric current sheet. At 1 AU the cloud had plasma signatures typical of a fast coronal mass ejection with low temperature and a leading shock. In contrast, at 4.8 AU, only the cloud signature remained. Its radial dimension was the same at both locations, consistent with little expansion beyond 1 AU. Energetic particle data at 4.8 AU show high fluxes preceding the cloud but not extending forward to the corotating shock that marked entry into the interaction region containing the cloud. The streaming direction was antisunward, consistent with possible acceleration in a low-beta region of field line draping around the cloud's western (upstream) end. The fluxes dropped upon entry into the cloud and became essentially isotropic one third of the way through it. On the basis of sector boundary characteristics published in the past, we suggest that distended clouds may be common heliospheric current sheet occlusions.

The response of filamentary and spherical clouds to the turbulence and magnetic field

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Gholipour, Mahmoud

2018-05-01

Recent observations have revealed that there is a power-law relation between magnetic field and density in molecular clouds. Furthermore, turbulence has been observed in some regions of molecular clouds and the velocity dispersion resulting from the turbulence is found to correlate with to the cloud density. Relating to these observations, in this study, we model filamentary and spherical clouds in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium in two quiescent and turbulent regions. The proposed equations are expected to represent the impact of magnetic field and turbulence on the cloud structure and the relation of cloud mass with shape. The Virial theorem is applied to consider the cloud evolution leading to important conditions for equilibrium of the cloud over its lifetime. The obtained results indicate that under the same conditions of the magnetic field and turbulence, each shape presents different responses. The possible ways for the formation of massive cores or coreless clouds in some regions as well as the formation of massive stars or low-mass stars can be discussed based on the results of this study. It should be mentioned that the shape of the clouds plays an important role in the formation of the protostellar clouds as well as their structure and evolution. This role is due to the effects of magnetic fields and turbulence.

RELATIONSHIPs among Geomagnetic storms, interplanetary shocks, magnetic clouds, and SUNSPOT NUMBER during 1995-2012

During 1995-2012 Wind recorded 168 magnetic clouds (MCs), 197 magnetic cloud-like structures (MCLs), and 358 interplanetary (IP) shocks. Ninety four MCs and 56 MCLs had upstream shock waves. The following features are found: (i) Averages of solar wind speed, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), duration (<Ît>), strength of Bzmin, and intensity of the associated geomagnetic storm/activity (Dstmin) for MCs with upstream shock waves (MCSHOCK) are higher (or stronger) than those averages for the MCs without upstream shock waves (MCNO-SHOCK). (ii) The <Ît> of MCSHOCK events (â19.6 hr) is 9% longer than that for MCNO-SHOCK events (â17.9 hr). (iii) For the MCSHOCK events, the average duration of the sheath (<ÎtSHEATH>) is 12.1 hrs. These findings could be very useful for space weather predictions, i.e. IP shocks driven by MCs are expected to arrive at Wind (or at 1 AU) about ~12 hours ahead of the front of the MCs on average. (iv) The occurrence frequency of IP shocks is well associated with sunspot number (SSN). The average intensity of geomagnetic storms measured by for MCSHOCK and MCNOSHOCK events is -102 and -31 nT, respectively. The is -78, -70, and -35 nT for the 358 IP shocks, 168 MCs, and 197 MCLs, respectively. These results imply that IP shocks, when they occur with MCs/MCLs, must play an important role in the strength of geomagnetic storms. We speculate as to why this is so. Yearly occurrence frequencies of MCSHOCK and IP shocks are well correlated with solar activity (e.g., SSN). Choosing the right Dstmin estimating formula for predicting the intensity of MC-associated geomagnetic storms is crucial for space weather predictions.

Does the AlfvÃ©n wave wreck the large-scale magnetic cloud structure?

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Raghav, Anil N.; Kule, Ankita

2018-06-01

AlfvÃ©n waves are primal and pervasive in space plasmas and significantly contributes to microscale fluctuations in the solar wind and some heliospheric processes. Here, we demonstrate the first observable distinct feature of AlfvÃ©n wave while propagating from magnetic cloud to trailing solar wind. The WalÃ©n test is used to confirm their presence in selected regions. The amplitude ratio of inward to outward AlfvÃ©n waves is employed to establish their flow direction. The dominant inward flow is observed in magnetic cloud whereas trailing solar wind shows the dominant outward flow of AlfvÃ©n waves. The observed reduction in WalÃ©n slope and correlation coefficient within magnetic cloud suggest (i) the simultaneous presence of an inward & outward AlfvÃ©n waves and/or (ii) a possibility of magnetic reconnection and/or (iii) development of thermal anisotropy and/or (iv) dissipation of AlfvÃ©nic fluctuations. The study implies that either the AlfvÃ©n waves dissipate in the magnetic cloud or its presence can lead to disruption of the magnetic cloud structure.

COLLISIONS BETWEEN DARK MATTER CONFINED HIGH VELOCITY CLOUDS AND MAGNETIZED GALACTIC DISKS: THE SMITH CLOUD

The Galaxyâs population of High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) may include a subpopulation that is confined by dark matter minihalos and falling toward the Galactic disk. We present the first magnetohydrodynamic simulational study of dark-matter-dominated HVCs colliding with a weakly magnetized galactic disk. Our HVCs have baryonic masses of 5Â ÃÂ 10{sup 6}M{sub â} and dark matter minihalo masses of 0, 3Â ÃÂ 10{sup 8}, or 1Â ÃÂ 10{sup 9} M{sub â}. They are modeled on the Smith Cloud, which is said to have collided with the disk 70Â Myr ago. We find that, in all cases, the cloudâs collision with the galactic disk creates a hole inmoreÂ Â» the disk, completely disperses the cloud, and forms a bubble-shaped structure on the far side of the disk. In contrast, when present, the dark matter minihalo continues unimpeded along its trajectory. Later, as the minihalo passes through the bubble structure and galactic halo, it accretes up to 6.0Â ÃÂ 10{sup 5} M{sub â} in baryonic material, depending on the strengths of the magnetic field and minihalo gravity. These simulations suggest that if the Smith Cloud is associated with a dark matter minihalo and collided with the Galactic disk, the minihalo has accreted the observed gas. However, if the Smith Cloud is dark-matter-free, it is on its first approach toward the disk. These simulations also suggest that the dark matter is most concentrated either at the head of the cloud or near the cloud, depending upon the strength of the magnetic field, a point that could inform indirect dark matter searches.Â«Â less

Collapse and Fragmentation of Molecular Cloud Cores. VII. Magnetic Fields and Multiple Protostar Formation

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Boss, Alan P.

Recent observations of star-forming regions suggest that binary and multiple young stars are the rule rather than the exception and implicate fragmentation as the likely mechanism for their formation. Most numerical hydrodynamic calculations of fragmentation have neglected the possibly deleterious effects of magnetic fields, despite ample evidence for the importance of magnetic support of precollapse clouds. We present here the first numerical hydrodynamic survey of the collapse and fragmentation of initially magnetically supported clouds that takes into account several magnetic field effects in an approximate manner. The models are calculated with a three-dimensional, finite differences code that solves the equations of hydrodynamics, gravitation, and radiative transfer in the Eddington and diffusion approximations. Magnetic field effects are included through two simple approximations: magnetic pressure is added to the gas pressure, and magnetic tension is approximated by gravity dilution once collapse is well underway. Ambipolar diffusion of the magnetic field leading to cloud collapse is treated approximately as well. Models are calculated for a variety of initial cloud density profiles, shapes, and rotation rates. We find that in spite of the inclusion of magnetic field effects, dense cloud cores are capable of fragmenting into binary and multiple protostar systems. Initially prolate clouds tend to fragment into binary protostars, while initially oblate clouds tend to fragment into multiple protostar systems containing a small number (of the order of 4) of fragments. The latter are likely to be subject to rapid orbital evolution, with close encounters possibly leading to the ejection of fragments. Contrary to expectation, magnetic tension effects appear to enhance fragmentation, allowing lower mass fragments to form than would otherwise be possible, because magnetic tension helps to prevent a central density singularity from forming and producing a dominant

Compression of turbulent magnetized gas in giant molecular clouds

Interstellar gas clouds are often both highly magnetized and supersonically turbulent, with velocity dispersions set by a competition between driving and dissipation. This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases with constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting under the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between driving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be studied. In this paper, we present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that resembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some circumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a rate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized gas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing, magnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than would be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case. We use the simulation results to construct an analytic model that gives an effective equation of state for a coarse-grained parcel of the gas, in the form of an ideal equation of state with a polytropic index that depends on the dissipation and energy transfer rates between the magnetic and turbulent components. We argue that the reduced dissipation rate and larger equilibrium velocity dispersion has important implications for the driving and maintenance of turbulence in molecular clouds and for the rates of chemical and radiative processes that are sensitive to shocks and dissipation.

The role of magnetic fields in the collapse of protostellar gas clouds

The paper presents the results of a numerical calculation of the collapse of an idealized protostellar gas cloud including the effects of a 'frozen-in' magnetic field. The 'traditional' picture of magnetic effects on gas clouds and recent observational and theoretical work on the subject are summarized. Attention is given to the method of calculation and the results are interpreted. It is found that the central magnetic field in the collapsing cloud model follows a rho to the 1/2 power relation, and the discussion implies that this is a general result which should hold true for some range of initial conditions around those chosen. In addition, it is found that the outer envelope of the cloud will be held up by tension in the field lines.

The alignment of molecular cloud magnetic fields with the spiral arms in M33.

The formation of molecular clouds, which serve as stellar nurseries in galaxies, is poorly understood. A class of cloud formation models suggests that a large-scale galactic magnetic field is irrelevant at the scale of individual clouds, because the turbulence and rotation of a cloud may randomize the orientation of its magnetic field. Alternatively, galactic fields could be strong enough to impose their direction upon individual clouds, thereby regulating cloud accumulation and fragmentation, and affecting the rate and efficiency of star formation. Our location in the disk of the Galaxy makes an assessment of the situation difficult. Here we report observations of the magnetic field orientation of six giant molecular cloud complexes in the nearby, almost face-on, galaxy M33. The fields are aligned with the spiral arms, suggesting that the large-scale field in M33 anchors the clouds. Â©2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved

Electron temperatures within magnetic clouds between 2 and 4 AU: Voyager 2 observations

Sittler, E. C.; Burlaga, L. F.

1998-08-01

We have performed an analysis of Voyager 2 plasma electron observations within magnetic clouds between 2 and 4 AU identified by Burlaga and Behannon [1982]. The analysis has been confined to three of the magnetic clouds identified by Burlaga and Behannon that had high-quality data. The general properties of the plasma electrons within a magnetic cloud are that (1) the moment electron temperature anticorrelates with the electron density within the cloud, (2) the ratio Te/Tp tends to be >1, and (3) on average, Te/Tp~7.0. All three results are consistent with previous electron observations within magnetic clouds. Detailed analyses of the core and halo populations within the magnetic clouds show no evidence of either an anticorrelation between the core temperature TC and the electron density Ne or an anticorrelation between the halo temperature TH and the electron density. Within the magnetic clouds the halo component can contribute more than 50% of the electron pressure. The anticorrelation of Te relative to Ne can be traced to the density of the halo component relative to the density of the core component. The core electrons dominate the electron density. When the density goes up, the halo electrons contribute less to the electron pressure, so we get a lower Te. When the electron density goes down, the halo electrons contribute more to the electron pressure, and Te goes up. We find a relation between the electron pressure and density of the form Pe=Î±NeÎ³ with Î³~0.5.

Evidence in Magnetic Clouds for Systematic Open Flux Transport on the Sun

Most magnetic clouds encountered by spacecraft at 1 AU display a mix of unidirectional suprathermal electrons signaling open field lines and counterstreaming electrons signaling loops connected to the Sun at both ends. Assuming the open fields were originally loops that underwent interchange reconnection with open fields at the Sun, we determine the sense of connectedness of the open fields found in 72 of 97 magnetic clouds identified by the Wind spacecraft in order to obtain information on the location and sense of the reconnection and resulting flux transport at the Sun. The true polarity of the open fields in each magnetic cloud was determined from the direction of the suprathermal electron flow relative to the magnetic field direction. Results indicate that the polarity of all open fields within a given magnetic cloud is the same 89% of the time, implying that interchange reconnection at the Sun most often occurs in only one leg of a flux rope loop, thus transporting open flux in a single direction, from a coronal hole near that leg to the foot point of the opposite leg. This pattern is consistent with the view that interchange reconnection in coronal mass ejections systematically transports an amount of open flux sufficient to reverse the polarity of the heliospheric field through the course of the solar cycle. Using the same electron data, we also find that the fields encountered in magnetic clouds are only a third as likely to be locally inverted as not. While one might expect inversions to be equally as common as not in flux rope coils, consideration of the geometry of spacecraft trajectories relative to the modeled magnetic cloud axes leads us to conclude that the result is reasonable.

Molecular cloud formation in high-shear, magnetized colliding flows

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Fogerty, E.; Frank, A.; Heitsch, F.; Carroll-Nellenback, J.; Haig, C.; Adams, M.

2016-08-01

The colliding flows (CF) model is a well-supported mechanism for generating molecular clouds. However, to-date most CF simulations have focused on the formation of clouds in the normal-shock layer between head-on colliding flows. We performed simulations of magnetized colliding flows that instead meet at an oblique-shock layer. Oblique shocks generate shear in the post-shock environment, and this shear creates inhospitable environments for star formation. As the degree of shear increases (I.e. the obliquity of the shock increases), we find that it takes longer for sink particles to form, they form in lower numbers, and they tend to be less massive. With regard to magnetic fields, we find that even a weak field stalls gravitational collapse within forming clouds. Additionally, an initially oblique collision interface tends to reorient over time in the presence of a magnetic field, so that it becomes normal to the oncoming flows. This was demonstrated by our most oblique shock interface, which became fully normal by the end of the simulation.

Experimental Investigation of Electron Cloud Containment in a Nonuniform Magnetic Field

Dense clouds of electrons were generated and studied in an axisymmetric, nonuniform magnetic field created by a short solenoid. The operation of the experiment was similar to that of a low-pressure (approximately 0.000001 Torr) magnetron discharge. Discharge current characteristics are presented as a function of pressure, magnetic field strength, voltage, and cathode end-plate location. The rotation of the electron cloud is determined from the frequency of diocotron waves. In the space charge saturated regime of operation, the cloud is found to rotate as a solid body with frequency close to V sub a/phi sub a where V sub a is the anode voltage and phi suba is the total magnetic flux. This result indicates that, in regions where electrons are present, the magnetic field lines are electrostatic equipotentials (E bar, B bar = 0). Equilibrium electron density distributions suggested by this conditions are integrated with respect to total ionizing power and are found consistent with measured discharge currents.

Saharan Dust Event Impacts on Cloud Formation and Radiation over Western Europe

We investigated the impact of mineral dust particles on clouds, radiation and atmospheric state during a strong Saharan dust event over Europe in May 2008, applying a comprehensive online-coupled regional model framework that explicitly treats particle-microphysics and chemical composition. Sophisticated parameterizations for aerosol activation and ice nucleation, together with two-moment cloud microphysics are used to calculate the interaction of the different particles with clouds depending on their physical and chemical properties. The impact of dust on cloud droplet number concentration was found to be low, with just a slight increase in cloud droplet number concentration for both uncoated and coated dust. For temperatures lower than the level of homogeneous freezing, no significant impact of dust on the number and mass concentration of ice crystals was found, though the concentration of frozen dust particles reached up to 100 l-1 during the ice nucleation events. Mineral dust particles were found to have the largest impact on clouds in a temperature range between freezing level and the level of homogeneous freezing, where they determined the number concentration of ice crystals due to efficient heterogeneous freezing of the dust particles and modified the glaciation of mixed phase clouds. Our simulations show that during the dust events, ice crystals concentrations were increased twofold in this temperature range (compared to if dust interactions are neglected). This had a significant impact on the cloud optical properties, causing a reduction in the incoming short-wave radiation at the surface up to -75Wm-2. Including the direct interaction of dust with radiation caused an additional reduction in the incoming short-wave radiation by 40 to 80Wm-2, and the incoming long-wave radiation at the surface was increased significantly in the order of +10Wm-2. The strong radiative forcings associated with dust caused a reduction in surface temperature in the order of -0

Magnetic suppression of turbulence and the star formation activity of molecular clouds

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Zamora-AvilÃ©s, Manuel; VÃ¡zquez-Semadeni, Enrique; KÃ¶rtgen, Bastian; Banerjee, Robi; Hartmann, Lee

2018-03-01

We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations aimed at studying the effect of the magnetic suppression of turbulence (generated through various instabilities during the formation of molecular clouds by converging) on the subsequent star formation (SF) activity. We study four magnetically supercritical models with magnetic field strengths B = 0, 1, 2, and 3 Î¼G (corresponding to mass-to-flux ratios of â, 4.76, 2.38, and 1.59 times the critical value), with the magnetic field, initially being aligned with the flows. We find that, for increasing magnetic field strength, the clouds formed tend to be more massive, denser, less turbulent, and with higher SF activity. This causes the onset of SF activity in the non-magnetic or more weakly magnetized cases to be delayed by a few Myr in comparison to the more strongly magnetized cases. We attribute this behaviour to the suppression of the non-linear thin shell instability (NTSI) by the magnetic field, previously found by Heitsch and coworkers. This result is contrary to the standard notion that the magnetic field provides support to the clouds, thus reducing their star formation rate. However, our result is a completely non-linear one, and could not be foreseen from simple linear considerations.

Magnetization of Cloud Cores and Envelopes and Other Observational Consequences of Reconnection Diffusion

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Lazarian, A.; Esquivel, A.; Crutcher, R.

2012-10-01

Recent observational results for magnetic fields in molecular clouds reviewed by Crutcher seem to be inconsistent with the predictions of the ambipolar diffusion theory of star formation. These include the measured decrease in mass to flux ratio between envelopes and cores, the failure to detect any self-gravitating magnetically subcritical clouds, the determination of the flat probability distribution function (PDF) of the total magnetic field strengths implying that there are many clouds with very weak magnetic fields, and the observed scaling BvpropÏ2/3 that implies gravitational contraction with weak magnetic fields. We consider the problem of magnetic field evolution in turbulent molecular clouds and discuss the process of magnetic field diffusion mediated by magnetic reconnection. For this process that we termed "reconnection diffusion," we provide a simple physical model and explain that this process is inevitable in view of the present-day understanding of MHD turbulence. We address the issue of the expected magnetization of cores and envelopes in the process of star formation and show that reconnection diffusion provides an efficient removal of magnetic flux that depends only on the properties of MHD turbulence in the core and the envelope. We show that as the amplitude of turbulence as well as the scale of turbulent motions decrease from the envelope to the core of the cloud, the diffusion of the magnetic field is faster in the envelope. As a result, the magnetic flux trapped during the collapse in the envelope is being released faster than the flux trapped in the core, resulting in much weaker fields in envelopes than in cores, as observed. We provide simple semi-analytical model calculations which support this conclusion and qualitatively agree with the observational results. Magnetic reconnection is also consistent with the lack of subcritical self-gravitating clouds, with the observed flat PDF of field strengths, and with the scaling of field

Deep R-band CCD linear polarimetry collected for fields with lines of sight toward the Lupus I molecular cloud is used to investigate the properties of the magnetic field within this molecular cloud. The observed sample contains about 7000 stars, almost 2000 of them with a polarization signal-to-noise ratio larger than 5. These data cover almost the entire main molecular cloud and also sample two diffuse infrared patches in the neighborhood of Lupus I. The large-scale pattern of the plane-of-sky projection of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the main axis of Lupus I, but parallel to the two diffuse infraredmoreÂ Â» patches. A detailed analysis of our polarization data combined with the Herschel/SPIRE 350 Î¼m dust emission map shows that the principal filament of Lupus I is constituted by three main clumps that are acted on by magnetic fields that have different large-scale structuralÂ properties. These differences may be the reason for the observed distribution of pre- and protostellar objects along the molecular cloud and the cloudâsÂ apparent evolutionary stage. On the other hand, assuming that the magnetic field is composed ofÂ large-scale and turbulent components, we find that the latter is rather similar in all three clumps. The estimated plane-of-sky component of the large-scale magnetic field ranges from about 70 to 200 Î¼G in these clumps. The intensity increases toward the Galactic plane. The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio is much smaller than unity, implying that Lupus I is magnetically supported on large scales.Â«Â less

Fast instability caused by electron cloud in combined function magnets

Antipov, S. A.; Adamson, P.; Burov, A.; ...

2017-04-10

One of the factors which may limit the intensity in the Fermilab Recycler is a fast transverse instability. It develops within a hundred turns and, in certain conditions, may lead to a beam loss. The high rate of the instability suggest that its cause is electron cloud. Here, we studied the phenomena by observing the dynamics of stable and unstable beam, simulating numerically the build-up of the electron cloud, and developed an analytical model of an electron cloud driven instability with the electrons trapped in combined function di-poles. We also found that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearingmoreÂ Â» bunch, which confirms the electron cloud nature of the instability. The clearing suggest electron cloud trapping in Recycler combined function mag-nets. Numerical simulations show that up to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since the process of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount of electrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next revolution. Furthermore, in a Recycler combined function dipole this multi-turn accumulation allows the electron cloud reaching final intensities orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole. The estimated resulting instability growth rate of about 30 revolutions and the mode fre-quency of 0.4 MHz are consistent with experimental observations and agree with the simulation in the PEI code. The created instability model allows investigating the beam stability for the future intensity upgrades.Â«Â less

Performance Analysis of Cloud Computing Architectures Using Discrete Event Simulation

Cloud computing offers the economic benefit of on-demand resource allocation to meet changing enterprise computing needs. However, the flexibility of cloud computing is disadvantaged when compared to traditional hosting in providing predictable application and service performance. Cloud computing relies on resource scheduling in a virtualized network-centric server environment, which makes static performance analysis infeasible. We developed a discrete event simulation model to evaluate the overall effectiveness of organizations in executing their workflow in traditional and cloud computing architectures. The two part model framework characterizes both the demand using a probability distribution for each type of service request as well as enterprise computing resource constraints. Our simulations provide quantitative analysis to design and provision computing architectures that maximize overall mission effectiveness. We share our analysis of key resource constraints in cloud computing architectures and findings on the appropriateness of cloud computing in various applications.

Evolution of magnetic fields in collapsing star-forming clouds under different environments

In nearby star-forming clouds, amplification and dissipation of the magnetic field are known to play crucial roles in the star-formation process. The star-forming environment varies from place to place and era to era in galaxies. In this study, amplification and dissipation of magnetic fields in star-forming clouds are investigated under different environments using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. We consider various star-forming environments in combination with the metallicity and the ionization strength, and prepare prestellar clouds having two different mass-to-flux ratios. We calculate the cloud collapse until protostar formation using ideal and non-ideal (inclusion and exclusion of ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion) MHD calculations to investigate the evolution of the magnetic field. We perform 288 runs in total and show the diversity of the density range within which the magnetic field effectively dissipates, depending on the environment. In addition, the dominant dissipation process (Ohmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion) is shown to strongly depend on the star-forming environment. Especially, for the primordial case, magnetic field rarely dissipates without ionization source, while it efficiently dissipates when very weak ionization sources exist in the surrounding environment. The results of this study help to clarify star formation in various environments.

MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE VELA C MOLECULAR CLOUD

We have performed extensive near-infrared ( JHK {sub s}) imaging polarimetry toward the Vela C molecular cloud, which covers the five high-density sub-regions (North, Centre-Ridge, Centre-Nest, South-Ridge, and South-Nest) with distinct morphological characteristics. The obtained polarization vector map shows that three of these sub-regions have distinct plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnetic-field characteristics according to the morphological characteristics. (1) In the Centre-Ridge sub-region, a dominating ridge, the POS magnetic field is mostly perpendicular to the ridge. (2) In the Centre-Nest sub-region, a structure having a slightly extended nest of filaments, the POS magnetic field is nearly parallel to its global elongation. (3) InmoreÂ Â» the South-Nest sub-region, which has a network of small filaments, the POS magnetic field appears to be chaotic. By applying the ChandrasekharâFermi method, we derived the POS magnetic field strength as â¼70â310 Î¼ G in the Centre-Ridge, Centre-Nest, and South-Ridge sub-regions. In the South-Nest sub-region, the dispersion of polarization angles is too large to apply the C-F method. Because the velocity dispersion in this sub-region is not greater than those in the other sub-regions, we suggest that the magnetic field in this sub-region is weaker than those in other sub-regions. We also discuss the relationship between the POS magnetic field (configuration and strength) and the cloud structure of each sub-region.Â«Â less

We studied the impact of long-range transported African Dust (LRTAD) on cloud composition and properties at the Caribbean tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Pico del Este (PE), as part of the Puerto Rico African Dust and Clouds Study (PRADACS). Here we present results from measurements performed in July 2011. Bulk chemical analysis of cloud water and rainwater showed pH and conductivity higher in the presence of dust. pH and conductivity were also higher for larger cloud droplets (size cut of 17 Î¼m at 50% efficiency) suggesting a higher content of dust in this fraction. The concentration of the water-soluble ions in rainwater was found to be lower than for cloud water. This in turn translates to higher pH and lower conductivity. African dust influence at PE was confirmed by the presence of nss-Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, and Al in cloud/rain water, and inferred by HYSPLIT trajectories and the satellite images from the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). Interstitial single-particle size and chemistry measured using aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed mostly sea-salt particles (Na, Cl, Ca) and dust particles (Fe, Ti, Mg, nss-Ca). Anthropogenic influence detected as the presence of EC, a tracer for combustion processes, was found to be fairly small according to ATOFMS measurements. An increase of total o
