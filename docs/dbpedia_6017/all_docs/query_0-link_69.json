        "text": "If you’re looking for a list of great movies and TV series about animals and vegan living, we have you covered. Thanks to Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video, and other streaming services, many life-changing movies are easily accessible. You could host viewing parties at your place with friends and family or conduct them virtually by watching the films simultaneously in the comfort of your respective homes.\n\nHere are some vegan-related movies and series and where to stream them:\n\nThe Failed Experiment (2024)\n\nThis groundbreaking docuseries from PETA and executive producer Bill Maher gut-wrenchingly lays bare the failure of current methods of medical research, which rely heavily on cruel and useless experiments on our fellow animals. In six brief but unforgettable episodes, The Failed Experiment stares down the status quo, questioning what’s not working with current systems and providing much-needed solutions for modernizing the world of medical research.\n\nNow available for free on YouTube:\n\nAlso available on Prime Video.\n\nThe End of Medicine (2022)\n\nBAFTA-winning director Alex Lockwood’s newest documentary, The End of Medicine, highlights how using animals increases the likelihood of existential health threats such as zoonotic disease, chronic disease, and antimicrobial resistance. Because shooting began before the COVID-19 pandemic, the film offers a unique look at how zoonotic diseases start and rapidly spread, in addition to being a warning that future pandemics will result from using and eating animals. Dr. Alice Brough and other experts on agriculture, politics, and medicine discuss how the end of animal agriculture is necessary to stop the development of new antibiotic-resistant diseases. Actors and animal activists Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara served as executive producers on the film.\n\nTo learn more, listen to The PETA Podcast episode featuring special guest Dr. Alice Brough.\n\nWatch on iTunes.\n\nThe Invisible Vegan (2022)\n\nThe Invisible Vegan is a documentary about dietary patterns in the African American community and how going vegan can help alleviate some health issues that commonly affect Black Americans. The film tells the story of codirector Jasmine Leyva’s journey to going vegan, along with the personal experiences of other vegan activists and celebrities.\n\nWatch on Prime Video, Tubi, or Vimeo.\n\nSeaspiracy (2021)\n\nSeaspiracy, a documentary by directors Ali and Lucy Tabrizi, uncovers the commercial fishing industry’s harmful practices and highlights the pressing need to protect marine animals and our world’s oceans. The film comes from producer Kip Andersen, who was also behind Cowspiracy and What the Health. In the process of making the film, the team came to understand the vast scale of destruction that the global fishing industry is responsible for and the shocking way that governments and environmental groups have profited from it. Seaspiracy is a compelling story that reveals the one thing we can all do to save our oceans and the animals who call them home.\n\nMy Octopus Teacher (2020)\n\nA 2021 Oscar nominee for Best Documentary Feature, My Octopus Teacher is a film about an unlikely friendship between filmmaker Craig Foster and an octopus. Foster spent a year freediving in a kelp forest off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa, where he forged a bond with an octopus and learned about her way of life. His experience is just another example of the way humans can learn so much from observing and respecting other animals—including just how similar we really are.\n\nBreaking the Chain (2020)\n\nThis documentary features behind-the-scenes footage following PETA’s dedicated fieldworkers, who respond to calls for help around the clock in all weather extremes. These first responders are on the front lines of the national overpopulation crisis, and Breaking the Chain shows their tireless work to help change the world for the dogs, cats, and other animals in our communities. It is available to stream for free on Prime Video and for only 99 cents on all other platforms.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play, Prime Video, Vimeo, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\nThe Animal People (2019)\n\nPETA supporter Joaquin Phoenix served as executive producer for The Animal People, which tells the story of six animal activists who were targeted by the FBI for exposing one of the world’s largest animal-testing labs.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play, Netflix, Prime Video, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\nThe Game Changers (2019)\n\nThe world’s biggest myth about meat is about to be busted by this flick brought to you by James Cameron and Louie Psihoyos, director of The Cove. Former Ultimate Fighting Championship winner and military combat instructor James Wilks embarks on a “quest for the truth” that puts him in touch with top athletes and experts around the world who reveal that the best way to excel in sports and life in general is by eating plant-based foods.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Fandango Now, Google Play, Netflix, Prime Video, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\nLong Gone Wild (2019)\n\nLong Gone Wild explores early orca capture and confinement—from the first capture and display of an orca, Namu, to the creation of the “legend” of Shamu—and covers the evolution and subsequent failures of SeaWorld.\n\nLong Gone Wild is available on multiple video-on-demand services including Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon, Vimeo, VUDU, and Fandango NOW. Cable providers—including DIRECTV, xfinity, Cox, Spectrum, Verizon, Sling, Google Fiber, Frontier, CenturyLink, Mediacom, Suddenlink, dish, and Rogers—will also be screening the film. Check Amazon, Walmart, Barnes & Noble, or Best Buy to purchase it on DVD.\n\nWatch on Google Play, iTunes, Prime Video, Tubi, Vimeo, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\nSled Dogs (2017)\n\nIn the Iditarod, dogs are forced to run approximately 1,000 miles—about the distance from Memphis, Tennessee, to New York City—through biting winds, blinding snowstorms, and subzero temperatures. More than 150 dogs have died as a result of the race, not including countless others who were killed simply because they weren’t fast enough or who died during the off-season while chained up. Sled Dogs, a documentary by director Fern Levitt, exposes the ugly behind-the-scenes cruelty in the dogsledding industry.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Peacock, Plex, Prime Video, or Tubi.\n\nOkja (2017)\n\nJake Gyllenhaal plays a deranged zookeeper in ‘Okja,’ which is being called the world’s first vegetarian action movie.\n\nWhat the Health (2017)\n\nThe filmmakers behind the popular Cowspiracy expose a different side of the food industry that contributes to and profits from a health epidemic.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play, Netflix, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nCOWSPIRACY: The Sustainability Secret (2014)\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is the executive producer of this documentary, which takes on the meat industry, the most environmentally destructive force on the planet today. And this flick is changing the world. The owner of a Texas restaurant has decided to switch to a completely vegan menu after seeing it!\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play, Netflix, Prime Video, or YouTube.\n\nFed Up (2014)\n\nThis documentary explains that at the rate at which the U.S. is currently eating, one out of every three Americans will have diabetes by 2050.

It may be a wake-up call for the viewer, who might be seeing animals as individuals rather than objects for the first time.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, Google Play, or YouTube.\n\nForks Over Knives (2011)\n\nThis documentary compares the Western diet with that of other countries, which have lower rates of cancer and heart disease. It challenges authorities who seem to be ignoring the link between meat and dairy consumption and disease in order to protect the status quo in the U.S. and touts the benefits of plant-based foods.

You’ll learn why corn finds its way into even the most unlikely foods, about the cruel practice of fattening chickens with hormones to speed their growth, and how current laws exonerate corporations and companies, such as factory farms, from being held accountable for their methods of production.\n\nWatch on Apple TV, FlixFling, Google Play, Hoopla, Microsoft Store, Pluto TV, Prime Video, Redbox, Tubi, Vudu, or YouTube.\n\nI Am An Animal: The Story of Ingrid Newkirk and PETA (2007)\n\nMeet the woman who founded PETA.
