        "text": "Zoo, directed by Colin McIvor tells the story of a twelve-year-old body named Tom Hall (Art Parkinson) whose father (Damian O’Hare) works as a veterinarian at the Belfast zoo in 1941. The zoo has acquired a new elephant named Buster of whom Tom is very fond. When war hits Belfast, Tom’s father is sent off to war, and Tom is left with a duty to care for Buster once the government decides they must kill any dangerous animals in the event an air raid should set them free. To do so, Tom enlists the help of two school friends, Jane (Emily Flain), and Pete (Ian O’Reilly) who brings along his younger brother, Mickey (James Stockdale). They devise a plan to break Buster out of the zoo and bring him to a safe location. When that location no longer works, Tom begs for the assistance of a local animal lover named Denise Austin (Penelope Wilton). Once at Mrs. Austin’s house, Buster and his friends face many challenges, including an air raid and much more.\n\nThe majority of the film relies on Art Parkinson and his emotional performance. He does fantastic work shouldering much of the brunt of the story and emotional weight. It must also be mentioned that his group of friends played by Ian O’Reilly, Emily Flain and James Stockdale have great chemistry together and create a friendship that is both authentic and touching. Bound by their duty and care for an animal, their friendships only grow stronger. Penelope Wilton is a highlight of the film as well. Her beautiful portrayal of a heartbroken woman is spectacular and provides even more emotional depth to the story. While the relationships and friendships in the film are rather unlikely, this is what adds more emotion to the story.\n\nThis film is undoubtedly for animal lovers out there. The scenes with Buster as well as the glimpses of other animals in the zoo are magical. While I think that there are some scenes that have an issue with CGI Much like the film Zookeeper’s Wife, Zoo reminds us that even during the horrors of war, there are little miracles that happen. We must always look out for one another, especially the animals that are helpless and in need of love and attention. Bring the kids and the whole family to see Zoo! Zoo is a heartfelt story that is a mix of emotions full of humor, love, loss, and hope that endures even the tribulations of war.\n\nThe film is set to release in select theaters and on digital/ VOD on June 8th.
