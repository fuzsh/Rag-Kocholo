        "text": "Zookeeper may be earning some wretched reviews, but that shouldn’t stop the $80 million Kevin James film from opening fairly well at the box office.\n\nA group of zoo animals decide to break their code of silence in order to help their lovable zookeeper (Kevin James) find love – without opting to leave his current job for something more illustrious – woman.\n\nWhether one likes them or not, family-friendly comedies that feature talking animals and buffoonish main characters sell well, and for every person rolling his eyes at a movie like Beverly Hills Chihuahua or Yogi Bear, there’s another person going out to the theatre to see it.\n\nJames found major success with 2009’s Paul Blart: Mall Cop, which opened with $31.8 million and grossed $146.3 million total, and last year’s Grown Ups ($162 million total) again proved that audiences enjoy the comedic actor.\n\nZookeeper, which will play in 3,482 theatres, is arriving soon after fellow animal movie Mr. Popper’s Penguins, which opened to an alright $18.4 million three weeks ago. With a simpler premise and animals that can actually talk, observers think Zookeeper could improve on that film’s opening and earn $21 million.\n\nThe film is directed by Frank Coraci while the screenplay is by Nick Bakay and Rock Reuben. Kevin James, Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb are main actors."
