        "text": "If our animals could talk, they would sound just like the ones in this film. Kevin James plays a zookeeper, Griffin Keyes, who is trying to get a beautiful woman to fall in love with him. He's hopeless, so the animals he looks after start talking, telling him to use animal body language to win her love. The film really is funny; at some points I was laughing out loud.\n\nThey've got most of the animals' behaviour right. The funniest is a capuchin monkey, voiced by Adam Sandler; he's a cheeky wide-boy. I look after capuchin monkeys at Edinburgh Zoo, and that's exactly what they're like: always trying to get one over on you. Once, I left a brush and sponge within the reach of a capuchin, and the next thing I knew he'd run off with it and was tearing it to shreds. I'm not sure they really throw poo at each other as a mating ritual, however – that's what Sandler's monkey tells Griffin to do to get the girl.\n\nA pair of grizzly bears tell Griffin to growl at the girl, and show her his fat belly. It's funny when he tries that out, although I'm not sure I've ever seen the bears do that. He also takes the wolves' advice – to pee everywhere to mark his territory – a bit far, by peeing in the pot plants in a restaurant. But that is exactly what wolves might do.\n\nThe image of the hapless zookeeper who's better at relationships with animals than with people is a bit of a stereotype. But I did recognise certain aspects of myself in Griffin. In one scene, he buys tyres to cheer up the zoo's grumpy gorilla. We don't use tyres – we prefer enclosures to look natural – but I do often find myself looking around at things, thinking the animals would like them. I see a tree, and think, \"Ooh, the giraffes would like that.\" Or I get a box of raisins, and think about feeding them to the monkeys. You can't help it, when you work with animals, and care about them so much. They just get under your skin."
