        "text": "(Seguin) — Jungle Jack Hanna is best known for bringing the animal world into our homes through numerous television appearances, books, and major conservation projects. Hanna, who shared some of his experiences during an appearance last week at Texas Lutheran University, spent a few minutes talking to the local press about why he still has a passion for animals, and for the work that he does at the Columbus Zoo and beyond.\n\nHanna runs the Columbus Zoo, which is widely considered one of the largest and best zoos in the world. Hanna says he never knew that his work would grow into something so big, but he always knew that he wanted to work with animals and to have a place that could connect them to people.\n\n“At the age of 11 years old…I went to work for a veterinarian cleaning cages. He came out and took care of our cattle and stuff. So I said, ‘can I work at your clinic cleaning cages? I was there one summer at 12 years old, and he said, ‘Jack, I’m going to be the veterinarian for the Knoxsville, Tennessee zoo. That’s where we had our farm, and that’s where I was born. So I went to the zoo, and I loved it. Everyone asks me how I got started in this business. My dad was wounded in World War II under General Patton, and before my dad passed away — not from that, but other things — he said ‘Jack, remember one thing, you’ve always wanted to be a zookeeper. Don’t let these people make fun of you, because I know they do.’ And they did in high school, and even before high school, they would make fun of me,” said Hanna.\n\nHanna says the teasing continued even when he got into college. People just couldn’t imagine that “zookeeper” was going to be a viable career option, and they told him so on more than one occassion.\n\n“The president of the college called me into his office. There was only like 2,000 kids that go there, so the seniors made up about 300 or 400 of us. He would call each one of us in separately — you had to put down on a piece of paper, what you wanted to be after college, and I put down zookeeper. He calls me in there and says, ‘Jack, I called you first because I can’t believe this. You went through four years of college here and you want to be taking care of stinky, smelly places, and cleaning up animal poo and all that stuff?’ He said real serious to me, but not mean or anything. I said, ‘yes sir, because my dad before he passed away said these words to me…he said ‘Jack remember something — love what you do, and (remember) two other words, hard work,’” said Hanna.\n\nHe says that allows him to share his experiences with others, especially children who may never get that same opportunity, but who deserve to have a better understanding about the world today.\n\n“I’ve been at the Columbus Zoo now for 41 years. It’s now one of the largest zoos in the country. We didn’t want to be the largest, and just turned into it. We had 3.2 million people (visit) last year. The zoo, last year, was the largest attended event in the state of Ohio. We don’t look at it as having the most people, or having the largest zoo — the people of Columbus, Ohio wanted a beautiful zoo, and that’s what we did,” said Hanna said\n\nIf you were to ask Hanna what his favorite animal was, he would jokingly say “his wife, Suzi.” That answer appears to reflect his views of the overall animal kingdom. Hanna is a conservationist, but he says that he can’t forget about humans while he works to protect animals. He was very critical of the documentary film “Blackfish.” Hanna says he didn’t think the film accurately portrayed the practices of Sea World, and ignored some of the important work being done there. He says there has to be room to allow these animal experiences to be shared responsibly with the public.\n\n“When you have some children come in there, and they think a giraffe is a camel, you understand that they’ve never seen them. A lot of people can’t go see them. Unless you can see something in a zoo or see speeches like this and you see some animals up here, then you can’t save something and you can’t love something. It’s like the whales at Sea World. When that documentary (Blackfish) came out, I went nuts, because that is totally incorrect, what they did. We proved it by the way. Because I took my little girls there to see Sea World in Orlando, Florida when I had to move there to build the Central Florida Zoo in Sanford — they were four, seven and 10 years old, and today they are in their 40s, and they keep talking about the time they saw the whales at Sea World. That’s what it’s all about, (and) that’s what I’ll try to do tonight,” said Hanna.\n\nHanna’s conservation work has also been well documented, but he’s selective about the use of that word, and careful not to overuse it to cause more harm than good.\n\n“When I go into Africa, I have a home in Rwanda, and I go all over Africa and I go into villages in South America — when you walk into a village, you can’t go in there, to the guy that’s lived there for generations, and go ‘what are your conservation practices?’ Yes, they do eat these birds. Yes, they do eat those fish, and they do take that animal. They are taking them to keep their people alive. So one thing I found out, doing this since 1969 as a profession, you don’t walk into these people’s villages or other places and say ‘you can’t do that, or you can’t hunt that bird or you can’t hunt this thing.’ You cannot do that. They had it for centuries, (and) they are feeding their families. I go in there and ask them how they are doing. What animals do you have a problem with? I talk to them like a human being. In the zoo world, sometimes we go in there and just say ‘conservation, conservation, conservation’ — you have to talk to the people. They are human beings, and then at that point you can go work with them,” said Hanna.\n\nWhen it comes to conservation, Hanna practices what he preaches. He uses Rwanda as an example. He says there was a terrible poaching problem in the African nation, but he says they were able to turn that around by talking to the people there and finding a solution.\n\n“There are no mountain gorillas in any zoo in the world. Those are lowland gorillas from the Congo. I’ve filmed both of them. The mountain gorillas got down to 20 animals when Dian Fossey was up there, because of poaching. When people poach, those are just poachers who try to sell (gorilla parts). I saw gorilla hands used for ashtrays when I was there in ’82 and ’83. It was terrible. That’s uncalled for obviously,” said Hanna.\n\nHanna, before arriving in Seguin, he was in Florida working with officials there on the major red tide problem that has claimed the lives of hundreds of manatee and other marine life. He spoke to a packed house in TLU’s Jackson Auditorium last Tuesday. Hanna says that he thinks it’s important to get out and share what he knows. He also more than once complimented that animal facilities in the area, like the San Antonio Zoo and Sea World in San Antonio. He says they are doing great work and the people in this part of the state should be proud of both facilities."
