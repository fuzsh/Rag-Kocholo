        "text": "Can an autistic artist become an animator while also being a zoologist?\n\nHello, I am interested in becoming an animator in the animation industry as an autism advocate. However, with the rise of layoffs, AI, alongside other problems in the industry, I am trying to find a backup plan to have in case I am not able to make into the industry. I am thinking of becoming a zoologist but being an autistic person who is afraid of getting hurt, I am unsure if I want to become one or not. (For those who are in zoology or are zoologists, geologists, etc.) Is it possible for someone to become a zoologist while educating those with autism in the animation industry? Can a zoologist be a backup plan in case things go awry? What majors should I take to learn on how to become one?\n\nWhat are some challenges from being a zoologist?\n\nI’m in middle school in 8th grade wanting to learn and work with animals. I want to know about the challenges for being a zoologist. What degree do you need, how long do you stay in college, do you ever get attached with animals? I would like to know these questions so I can understand more and get more ideas for being a zooklogist. If anyone has worked with animals, what are the challenges I need to know?\n\nHow do I actually get into top tier schools?\n\nHi! I am aiming for top tier schools. I am a current freshman, 4.0 GPA. I do student council and mock trial. This year I took one AP and advanced class, next year I will be taking 3-4 AP classes. I am interested in zoology, pediatrics, youth advocacy, law, and government. What can I be doing to get into a good university? (Are my EC’s enough? I know I don’t have music or a sport)\n\nwhat does zoology involve what would I be getting into?\n\ni want to know what id be doing I love animals and want to work with them but idk how to get started or even what I would be doing once I was hired somewhere\n\nWhat major(s) should I have to be a zookeeper or work with animals (not a vet)?\n\nHello everyone. I would love to work with animals for my career. But I don't understand if I should go for Animal Science or Zoology. Or both? I don't want to be a vet necessarily. I would love to be a zookeeper overall, but I am not sure what major I should do. I appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nWhat are the most important things that I can do to get on track to becoming a Zoologist?\n\nHello! I am in high school and looking to maybe start a career in Zoology. Are there any things I can do to help me get on a sound track for college? In addition, what are some study tips you have for studying zoology (I know there is a lot of information)? Thanks!\n\nWhat is the most direct route to become a Zoologist?\n\nI want to become a Zoologist to be able to help and train animals. What would be the most direct way to get there?i know it takes 4 years and a at least a bachelors degree. I would like to start off working at the zoo for some experience with working with animals. What is the most direct route to get there?#zookeeper #zoologist #animals #animaltrainer\n\nWhat must you do to be a zoologist that works outdoors with animals?\n\nI am wondering. Once you decide that you will become a zoologist. Do you get to decide if you work out doors? If so. What things will you do as you work in the field and make contact with animals? #animals #zoology #zoologist #outdoors\n\nDo you find that some colleges are better for Zoology or Biology majors and if so what are they?\n\nI am a senior who is interested in going into Biology with a concentration in Zoology or a Zoology major. I would prefer a college in the Midwest but I am willing to find a college somewhere else in the United States as long as it has a good academic program. #biologist #zoologist #biology #science #college-selection\n\nBeing a Zookeeper do you find that you are allowed to specialize in certain animals?\n\nI am a senior in High School and I want to work in a zoo or somewhere with Big Cats. I will be happy as long as I can work with animals but I was wondering whether it depended on what you did in college or where you worked. #worker #zoologist #sanctuary\n\nI am majoring in Zoology. What specific area in Zoology have you made your career with?\n\nI have a passion for animals and would love one day to have my own rescue center. I know there are several different things you can do with a Zoology degree. Just looking for options on what to focus on. #career #zoologist #zoology"
