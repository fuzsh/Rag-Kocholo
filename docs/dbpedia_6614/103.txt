Shared Group Grade

The group submits one product and all group members receive the same grade, regardless of individual contribution.

encourages group work - groups sink or swim together

decreases likelihood of plagiarism (more likely with individual products from group work)

relatively straightforward method

individual contributions are not necessarily reflected in the marks

stronger students may be unfairly disadvantaged by weaker ones and vice versa

Group Average Grade

Individual submissions (allocated tasks or individual reports) are scored individually. The group members each receive the averageof these individual scores.

may provide motivation for students to focus on both individual and group work and thereby develop in both areas

may be perceived as unfair by students

stronger students may be unfairly disadvantaged by weaker ones and vice versa

Individual Grade - Allocated task

Each student completes an allocated task that contributes to the final group product and gets the marks for that task

a relatively objective way of ensuring individual participation

may provide additional motivation to students

potential to reward outstanding performance

difficult to find tasks that are exactly equal in size/complexity

does not encourage the group process/collaboration

dependencies between tasks may slow progress of some

Individual Grade - Examination

Exam questions specifically target the group projects, and can only be answered by students who have been thoroughly involved in the project

may increase motivation to learn from the group project including learning from the other members of the group

may diminish importance of group work

additional work for staff in designing exam questions

may not be effective, students may be able to answer the questions by reading the group reports

Student distribution of pool of marks

Instructor awards a set number of scores and let the group decide how to distribute them.

Example: 4 member group

Product grade: 80/100.

4 * 80 = 320 pts to be distributed.

No one student can be given less than zero or more than 100.

If members decide that they all contributed equally then each get 80

If they decided that person A deserved much more, then A might get 95, and the remaining if equal would get 75.

easy to implement

may motivate students to contribute more

negotiation skills become part of the learning process

potential to reward outstanding performance

may be perceived as fairer than shared or average group mark alone

open to subjective evaluation by friends

may lead to conflict

may foster competition and therefore be counterproductive to team work

students may not have the skills necessary for the required negotiation
