        "text": "Ookla’s latest data shows that average latency across the world’s mobile connections has decreased from 41ms to 36ms over the past year, although the latest mobile figure is still 70 percent slower than the average fixed internet connection.\n\nHowever, 5G connections will enable video game companies to offer more compelling mobile-oriented gaming titles in genres where latency is an important consideration, which may significantly increase the appeal of these games across geographies that currently struggle with slower connections.\n\nThis is particularly pertinent in the developing world, where fixed internet infrastructure is often unavailable, and where it does exist, mobile connection speeds are often faster anyway.\n\nBut this is also true in some of the world’s highly developed economies.\n\nFor example, average mobile connection speeds in Australia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia all outpace the average speed of each country’s fixed internet connections.\n\nThe greater bandwidth offered by 5G should also improve options for people who want to broadcast their own livestreams.\n\nThis has particular relevance to mobile esports and mobile game live-streaming, which depend on fast, stable connections for the best experience.\n\nBeyond gaming, improved mobile upload speeds will also enable a greater number of people to get involved in live commerce, empowering a new wave of mobile entrepreneurs to sell their wares in real-time via live-stream promotions.\n\nSo, if you’re wondering how 5G might impact your marketing, my tip would be to think beyond current marketing activities, and ask yourself whether now might be a good time to start exploring mobile gaming or live-stream commerce opportunities for your brand.\n\nSocial media isn’t just about mobile apps\n\nOne of the most interesting takeaways from the rankings of the world’s top websites in this year’s reports is that a large amount of social media activity still takes place within mobile browsers.\n\nFor example, Semrush reports that Facebook still attracts 1.8 billion unique visitors to its website each month, which equates to roughly two-thirds of its monthly active user base.\n\nLook beyond your borders\n\nVarious trends suggest that the ‘next big trend’ in digital won’t emerge from a Western market.\n\nFor example, as we saw above, the connected behaviours of people across Asia and Latin America are already reshaping online search.\n\nSimilarly, the popularity of live-streaming has revolutionised online shopping in China, where the ‘live commerce’ market is now worth around US$60 billion a year.\n\nThe live-stream shopping format has become so popular in China that just one influencer – Viya – sold more than US$4.5 billion through her Taobao live-stream channel last year.\n\nFor context, reports suggest that this equates to roughly the same amount that supermarket chain Carrefour sold across all its stores in China in the same period.\n\nHowever, data shows that the popularity of live commerce isn’t just a Chinese phenomenon, with the format also picking up momentum across Southeast Asia and India.\n\nWhat’s more, these three regions – China, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia – account for more than half of today’s global internet user base, so this is an opportunity that marketers around the world will want to tap into, even if live-stream shopping hasn’t taken off in their home market yet.\n\nDeveloping nations are also leading the way when it comes to innovations in digital finance.\n\nFor example, the latest data from GWI shows that internet users across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are far more likely to own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, compared to their peers in Europe and North America.\n\nHowever, the impact of these trends isn’t restricted to the developing world; they also have real significance for marketers in the West.\n\nWith many developed nations already seeing internet adoption rates in excess of 90 percent, big internet companies from the US and China know that they need to look to emerging markets to secure the next wave of growth.\n\nNote that these Snapchat figures represent quarterly growth, while the Facebook figures above showcase annual growth.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that these figures represent relative growth, not the absolute increase in user numbers.\n\nOlder age groups typically account for a smaller percentage of overall social media users than younger demographics, so it’s perhaps ‘easier’ for older age groups to record faster growth.\n\nFor context, users aged 25 to 34 still accounted for the greatest number of new Facebook users over the past year, even though they were already the platform’s largest demographic segment.\n\nHowever, these relative growth figures still show that a greater number of older users are joining social platforms.\n\nThese evolving demographics may bring new opportunities for marketers, together with new revenue streams for platforms and publishers.\n\nOnline grocery and the rise of ecommerce\n\nOne of the standout digital stories in 2020 was the rise of ecommerce, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving consumers all over the world to embrace online shopping.\n\nWith GWI data showing that most internet users already made online purchases even before the pandemic, there wasn’t much scope for an overall increase in ecommerce adoption rates amongst internet users.\n\nHowever, GWI data still shows that ecommerce adoption rates increased by 3.3 percentage points between Q2 and Q3 2020, representing quarterly growth of more than 4½ percent.\n\nAt a global level, nearly 77 percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 say they buy something online each month.\n\nInternet users in Indonesia are the most likely to make ecommerce purchases, with more than 87 percent of the country’s respondents to GWI’s survey saying they bought something online in the past month.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, just 57 percent of internet users in Egypt say they made an online purchase in the past 30 days.\n\nThe ecommerce adoption rate is also relatively low in Russia, where just 60 percent of internet users say they bought something via the internet in the past month.\n\nThese numbers support findings that we shared in our Digital 2020 July Global Statshot Report, when we reported that significant numbers of internet users had been saying they intended to continue with new online shopping behaviours that they’d adopted during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nMoreover, these numbers don’t just offer good news for supermarkets.\n\nGrocery shopping tends to be a high-frequency activity, which means that people have had the chance to develop new habits over recent months.\n\nAs most marketers know, it can be very difficult to inspire behaviour change – especially in high-frequency activities – so the new shopping habits of recent months present an unparalleled opportunity for brands and retailers to challenge the status quo.\n\nAnd what’s more, we’re already seeing evidence that people’s habits have changed in other categories too.\n\nOnline cosmetics purchases soared during the recent year-end holiday season, with shoppers around the world making more than 3½ times as many online category purchases in November 2020 as they did in January 2020.\n\nSome of this variance can likely be attributed to the category’s normal seasonality, but such a dramatic jump between January and December suggests that a significant number of purchases that people might previously have made in physical stores have now shifted online.\n\nThis echoes findings from Adobe, who reported that:\n\n“…it would’ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May 2020 if growth had continued at the same levels [we’d seen] for the past few years.”\n\nFurthermore, it’s now highly unlikely that people’s shopping behaviours will return to pre-pandemic patterns once daily life returns to some semblance of normality.\n\nWhile we can expect to see people return to physical stores once health concerns ease, many people will likely continue to conduct a greater share of their shopping activities online than they did prior to 2020.\n\nThese changes aren’t just about where people make their purchases, either.\n\nOur analysis suggests that people have moved a significant share of their activities across every step of the buyer journey into online channels, meaning that marketers may need to rethink every aspect of their activities – not just “last-mile” demand generation.\n\nLooking ahead: 2021 and beyond\n\nHopefully that’s given you a solid understanding of the ‘state of digital’ today.\n\nBut what does the future hold?\n\nBased on our ongoing analysis of these trends, here are some of the things we’ll be monitoring closely during the coming months.\n\nThe demise of third-party cookies\n\nBased on current plans, 2021 will be the last year that Google’s Chrome browsers support third-party cookies, which Apple’s Safari browsers already block by default.\n\nMany advertisers have relied on these cookies to power their targeting and reporting activities, so this change may have significant implications for many of the world’s digital marketers.\n\nIn the short term, this change may result in greater reliance on “walled garden” platforms such as Facebook and Amazon, because their on-platform technologies don’t rely on third-party cookies.\n\nHowever, almost all programmatic advertising companies will need to reinvent their models for a world without third-party cookies, so we may see a wave of new innovations in the ad tech industry over the coming months.\n\nFlexible working\n\nFor many white collar workers around the world, 2020 was the year of working from home, or “WFH” as it became commonly known.\n\nWFH looks like it will remain an enforced part of many people’s working lives for the foreseeable future too, with many countries still in the throes of high COVID-19 infection rates at the start of 2021.\n\nMoreover, many people may choose to continue with more flexible working practises even after the pandemic passes, and many employers may actively encourage such flexibility too.\n\nEvolving workplace dynamics have already inspired many changes in the world’s professional digital behaviours, from the rise of video conferencing to a greater reliance on software that helps teams manage remote workers.\n\nHowever, I expect to see further innovation in products and services designed to help with remote working over the coming months, especially in the areas of communication and ‘team cohesion’.\n\nConnected healthcare\n\nTelemedicine was already a hot topic in healthcare prior to the outbreak of COVID, but the coronavirus crisis of 2020 has accelerated the industry’s advance in much the same way that it accelerated people’s move to online shopping.\n\nDoctors around the world are now offering ‘remote’ consultations, with many turning to video conferencing platforms and even messenger apps to deliver diagnoses and advice for their patients.\n\nDigital solutions designed to help with wellness and wellbeing have also seen significant growth in recent months, and trends suggest that this will continue to be one of the hottest areas of growth in 2021 too.\n\nDigital finance\n\nThe ever-fluctuating price of Bitcoin continues to grab media headlines around the world, but it’s clear that ‘DeFi’ – decentralised finance – has started to gain more mainstream acceptance.\n\nFor context, it’s notoriously difficult to change people’s financial behaviours, with a popular industry axiom proclaiming that people are more likely to change their spouse than change their bank.\n\nHowever, data shows that increasing numbers of people are now turning to ‘alternative’ financial solutions, especially for products like insurance.\n\nMeanwhile, mobile payment platforms and ewallets are changing the ways in which people pay for things.\n\nThis is most clearly evident online, with Worldpay reporting that ewallets accounted for the greatest share of online purchases around the world in 2019, with almost twice as much share as credit cards.\n\nBut with many retailers and shoppers prioritising contactless payment methods in recent months due to COVID-19-related health concerns, mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay have come to the fore in physical retail too.\n\nI don’t foresee an ‘overnight revolution’ in consumer finance this year, but I do expect to see an acceleration in people’s adoption and use of more digital products and services in the financial services sector.\n\nOnline education\n\nMore than 1 billion people around the world faced some kind of disruption to their education in 2020 due to COVID-19, so we can expect increased emphasis on digital innovation in the world of learning over the coming months too.\n\nSome of this will relate to how individual educators deliver their materials, with innovations in ‘digital classroom’ solutions likely to continue apace in 2021.\n\nI’d expect to see some important changes in government policy too, with lawmakers all over the world addressing the societal imperatives and potential opportunities associated with enhanced online learning.\n\nThese innovations will likely extend to the corporate world too, with remote training and ‘upskilling’ remaining one of the hottest topics for HR professionals in 2021\n\nAnd given the importance of education, we might expect to see digital giants like Google and Facebook become more actively involved in this field too, potentially even collaborating to deliver much needed support to governments and educators around the globe.\n\nPortable digital identities\n\nWith digital privacy once again making headlines at the start of 2021 thanks to another furore surrounding platforms’ terms and conditions, 2021 may be the year when ‘portable digital identities’ start to gain more mainstream traction.\n\nPeople everywhere are increasingly aware of – and concerned about – how much of their ‘data’ they share, whether knowingly or not.\n\nAs a result, platforms and publishers may start to accept decentralised sign-on solutions, such as those offered by Inrupt.\n\nLarge internet companies will likely resist these third-party solutions due to the inevitable financial consequences, but if a sufficient number of users choose privacy over ad-supported content,\n\nWhat else?\n\nAre there any other trends that you’ll be watching in 2021? Send me your tips on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you’d like more tailored insights into what the future of digital might hold for your brand or business, get in touch with me on LinkedIn to learn more about Kepios’s Quarterly Digital Briefings.\n\nThe #CanineCrew managed to publish an additional 44 million #dog posts to Instagram, while #FelineFriends only managed 33 million new #cat posts.\n\nIt’s a similar story over on Twitter, where the platform’s advertising tools reveal that 307 million users are ‘interested’ in dogs, compared to just 23 million who are ‘interested’ in cats.\n\nThat’s a marked improvement on last year’s ratio of 250 million vs. 250 thousand, but dog lovers still outnumber cat lovers on Twitter by a factor of 13 to 1.\n\nBizarrely, even reptiles are more popular on Twitter than cats (35 million vs. 23 million).\n\nMaybe all the cats have been banned from Twitter for perceived threats to Larry.\n\nPerhaps most tellingly though, cats appear to be losing the battle for the web – arguably their home territory – with Google web page results for ‘dog’ outnumbering results for ‘cat’ by 3.83 million to 3.68 million at the start of 2021.\n\nBut as we’ve seen consistently throughout this year’s data, there are considerable differences between countries.\n\nIndia is clearly all about #TeamDog, with the country’s netizens more than three times as likely to enter a Google search for topics related to dogs as they are to search for topics related to cats.\n\nThe data tells a different tail in Indonesia though, where online searches for cats are more than twice as common as searches for dogs.\n\nI could go on, but much as I enjoy this pun-ditry, I’ve probably taken up enough of your 6 hours and 54 minutes for today, so I’ll paws things there.\n\nI’ll be back in a couple of weeks with the first of our Digital 2021 local country reports.\n\nUntil then, if you need any more stats, check out our complete free library of Global Digital Reports."
