Entrepreneurs continue to pursue small business ownership at record rates, and they’re turning to SCORE for help.\n\nFrom diverse backgrounds and industries, SCORE mentors know what it’s like to be a small business owner. They know it takes passion and hard work to make dreams come true. Partnering with entrepreneurs one-on-one, SCORE mentors support small business success by providing experienced advice, consulting on best practices, and education on business topics.\n\nIn 2023 alone, SCORE helped launch 31,167 new businesses and create 152,115 new jobs, including 120,948 non-owner jobs. We couldn’t accomplish this without the hard work of our 10,000 volunteers, who donated 4.5 million hours of their time to make it happen.\n\nAt SCORE, we believe anyone can successfully start a business with the right support. Whether you’re just starting or you’ve been in business for decades, connect with SCORE today and get the guidance you need to grow and thrive."
