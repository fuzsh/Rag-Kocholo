However, not all sexually explicit material is considered illegal. Indiana’s approach to regulating pornography is rooted in a delicate balance between protecting individual freedoms and maintaining public morals and safety. The legality hinges on several factors, such as the nature of the content, the age of the individuals depicted, and the context in which the material is produced, distributed, or possessed.\n\nObscene Matter or Performance\n\nAt its core, the legality of adult pornography in Indiana revolves around the state’s definition of obscene matter or performance. Under Indiana Code 35-49-2-1, a matter or performance is obscene if the average person, applying contemporary community standards, finds that the dominant theme of the matter or performance, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest in sex; and the matter or performance:\n\ndepicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct; and\n\ntaken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\n\nFor the purposes of pornography laws in Indiana, the term, “matter” includes books, magazines, newspapers, pictures, drawings, photographs, motion pictures, recordings or articles; while the term “performance,” includes “any play, motion picture, dance, or other exhibition or presentation, whether pictured, animated, or live, performed before an audience of one or more persons.” On top of that, as clearly defined in Indiana Code 35-49-1-9, sexual conduct includes acts of sexual intercourse or other sexual conduct; exhibition of the uncovered genitals in the context of masturbation or other sexual activity; exhibition of the uncovered genitals of a person under sixteen years of age; sad-masochistic abuse; or sexual intercourse or other sexual conduct with an animal.\n\nAs outlined in Indiana Code 35-49-3-1, a person may be charged with a Class A misdemeanor if they knowingly or intentionally send (or bring into Indiana) obscene matter for sale or distribution; or exhibit, distribute, or offer to distribute obscene matter to another person. If the matter in question depicts or describes any person who is or appears to be under 18, this charge may be elevated to a Level 6 felony.\n\nFurthermore, if a person knowingly or intentionally engages in, participates in, manages, produces, sponsors, presents, exhibits, photographs, films or videotapes any obscene performance in Indiana, they commit a Class A misdemeanor under Indiana Code 35-49-3-2. Again, if the matter in question depicts or describes any person who is or appears to be under 18, this charge may be elevated to a Level 6 felony.\n\nDissemination of Matter or Conducting Performance Harmful to Minors\n\nAs clearly defined in Indiana Code 35-49-2-2, a matter or performance is harmful to minors if it describes or represents nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse; considered as a whole, to appeal to the prurient interest in sex of minors; is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable matter for or performance before minors; and is considered, as a whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\n\nUnder the revised laws on the matter, effective January 1, 2024, a person may be charged with a Level 6 felony for the dissemination of matter or conducting a performance harmful to minors, if they knowingly or intentionally:\n\nDisseminate matter to minors that is harmful to minors\n\ndisplay matter that is harmful to minors in an area to which minors have visual, auditory, or physical access, unless each minor is accompanied by the minor’s parent or guardian;\n\nsell, rent, or display for sale or rent to any person matter that is harmful to minors within five hundred (500) feet of the nearest property line of a school or church;\n\nengage in or conduct a performance before minors that is harmful to minors;\n\nengage in in or conduct a performance that is harmful to minors in an area to which minors have visual, auditory, or physical access, unless each minor is accompanied by the minor’s parent or guardian;\n\nmisrepresent the minor’s age for the purpose of obtaining admission to an area from which minors are restricted because of the display of matter or a performance that is harmful to minors; or\n\nmisrepresent that the person is a parent or guardian of a minor for the purpose of obtaining admission of the minor to an area where minors are being restricted because of display of matter or performance that is harmful to minors\n\nIndiana Pornography Laws Involving Children\n\nThe pornography laws in Indiana adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards child exploitation. Any material that visually depicts or represents minors engaged in sexual activity is strictly illegal, irrespective of the medium. This prohibition extends to possession, creation, distribution, and even viewing such content. The laws are stringent, with severe penalties for violators, reflecting the state’s commitment to protecting minors.\n\nAs detailed in Indiana Code 35-42-4-4, a person may be charged with child exploitation, a Level 5 felony in Indiana, if they:\n\nknowingly or intentionally manage, produce, sponsor, present, or exhibit photographs, films, videotapes, or create a digitized image of any performance or incident that:\n\nincludes sexual conduct by a child under eighteen (18) years of age; or\n\nany performance or incident that includes the uncovered genitals of a child less than eighteen (18) years of age or the exhibition of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple by a child less than eighteen (18) years of age\n\nknowingly or intentionally disseminate, exhibit to another person, offer to disseminate or exhibit to another person, or send or bring into Indiana for dissemination or exhibition matter that:\n\ndepicts or describes sexual conduct by a child under eighteen (18) years of age; or\n\nany performance or incident that includes the uncovered genitals of a child less than eighteen (18) years of age or the exhibition of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple by a child less than eighteen (18) years of age\n\nknowingly or intentionally makes available to another person a computer, knowing that the computer’s fixed drive or peripheral device contains matter that:\n\ndepicts or describes sexual conduct by a child less than eighteen (18) years of age; or\n\ndepicts the uncovered genitals of a child less than eighteen (18) years of age or the exhibition of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple by a child less than eighteen (18) years of age\n\nknowingly or intentionally produce, disseminate, or possess with intent to disseminate an image that depicts or describes sexual conduct\n\nby a child who the person knows is less than eighteen (18) years of age;\n\nby a child less than eighteen (18) years of age, or by a person who appears to be a child less than eighteen (18) years of age, if the image is obscene; or\n\nthat is simulated sexual conduct involving a representation that appears to be a child less than eighteen (18) years of age, if the representation of the image is obscene\n\nUnder some circumstances, the pornography laws in Indiana allow for those suspected of child exploitation to be charged with a Level 4 felony. These circumstances vary, but generally, include factors related to the specific content of the pornography and the age and mental capacity of the victim.\n\nPossession of Child Pornography in Indiana\n\nIn addition to child exploitation, a person may be charged with possession of child pornography, a Level 6 felony under most circumstances. This can occur when a person, with the intent to view an image, knowingly or intentionally possesses or accesses an image that depicts or describes sexual conduct by a child who the person knows is less than 18 years of age. It may also occur when the image in question is of a child who less than 18 years old or by a person who appears to be a child less than 18, if the representation of the image is obscene. Finally, a person may be charged with possession of child pornography in Indiana if they possess or access an image that includes simulated sexual conduct involving a representation that appears to be a child less than 18 years of age, if the image is obscene.\n\nOnce again, the pornography laws in Indiana allow for those suspected of being in possession of child pornography to be charged with a Level 5 felony if certain enhancing circumstances apply. Similar to the laws on child exploitation, these circumstances vary, but generally include factors related to the specific content of the pornography and the age and mental capacity of the victim.\n\nRevenge Pornography Laws in Indiana\n\nThe advent of the internet and digital media has added complexity to enforcing the pornography laws in Indiana. However, in recent years, the state addressed concerns of revenge pornography in Indiana by enacting a law that prohibits individuals from “distributing an intimate image,” without consent.\n\nAs stated in Indiana Code 35-45-4-8(c), a person who “knows or reasonably should know that an individual depicted in an intimate image does not consent to the distribution of the intimate image; and distributes the intimate image; commits distribution of an intimate image, a Class A misdemeanor. However, the offense is a Level 6 felony if the person has a prior unrelated conviction under this section.”\n\nFor the purposes of this law, an “intimate image,” refers to a photograph, digital image or video that depicts sexual intercourse, other sexual conduct (see below), or exhibition of the uncovered buttocks, genitals, or female breast of an individual.” Per Indiana law, this photograph, digital image or video, must have either been taken, captured, or recorded by an individual depicted and given or transmitted directly to the defendant; OR taken, captured, or recorded by the defendant in the physical presence of an individual depicted in the photograph, digital image, or video.\n\nSale of Sexually Explicit Materials in Indiana\n\nThe state of Indiana actively regulates the sale of sexually explicit material, requiring all persons or businesses that intend to sell this material to properly register with the secretary of the state and provide a statement detailing the types of materials they intend to offer for sale. As defined in Indiana Code 24-4-16.4-2, this includes products or services that are: (a) harmful to minors, even if it is not intended to be used by or offered to a minor; (b) that are designed for use in, marketed primarily for, or provide for the stimulation of the human genital organs or masochism or masochistic experience, sadism or a sadistic experience, sexual bondage, or sexual domination.\n\nIf a person or an employee/agent of a person knowingly or intentionally offers for sale or sells sexually explicit materials without properly filing or registered with the state, they may be charged with the unregistered sale of sexually explicit materials. Under Indiana code 24-4-16.4-4, this is considered a Class B misdemeanor. It is important to note, however, that this does not apply to individuals selling birth control or contraceptive devices or services/programs/products/materials provided by a communication service provider (such as a television or internet provider).\n\nQuestions about the Pornography Laws in Indiana?\n\nIn summary, the pornography laws in Indiana encompass a range of statutes and legal nuances, from defining the difference between obscene and legal adult content to strictly prohibiting child pornography and the distribution of intimate images. Understanding and respecting the boundaries set by these laws is crucial in today’s interconnected world. By staying informed and vigilant, individuals can protect themselves from unintended legal entanglements and contribute to a safer and more responsible society."
