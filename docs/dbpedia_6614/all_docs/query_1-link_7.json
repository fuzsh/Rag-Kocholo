        "text": "Google works in mysterious ways and it's very different from other websites.\n\nIt's not always obvious why a page ranks above other pages in a SERP. At first glance, there's no way to tell whether it's based on domain authority, a website's backlink profile or any other numerous ranking factors that allow websites to stand out on search engines.\n\nMarketers and seo experts usually try to hunt for actionable insights when trying to climb to one of the top ten positions on search engine results pages Â - reviewing any broken links, checking domain authority scores, or making sure that their website has high quality backlinks. What happens when that's not enough, though?\n\nWhile you spend precious time troubleshooting, other websites are putting their finger on the specific ranking factor that's holding them back using popular seo tools. Honestly, don't feel bad though, google rankings are not always based on link popularity or a website's domain rating. It's not obvious, which is why it can be so frustrating trying to establish website authority.\n\nThat said, if page authority is on your list of priorities, a fix here and there, perhaps adding more backlinks, tweaking your seo strategies just slightly could help you get just one rank higher or increase search traffic enough to skyrocket your web pages to the very top of search engine result pages.\n\nAlthough there are multiple factors, they usually dig into three main areas:\n\nBacklinks + Link building strategy\n\nOn-page optimization\n\nContent\n\nThere are endless marketing tools that solve off-page factors and technical SEO. Yet none of them have figured out how to *really* solve for content. How to evaluate if the content is good enough to rank higher? How does it compare against the targeted keywords and other page results in the SERP?\n\nIntroducing Content Score Checker\n\nContent Score by Surfer is here to fill the gap. Generally speaking, it's Â a real-time, fully automated score that saves you tons of time and effort on manual research and ensures your SEO efforts are hitting the right place. No need to check similar sites because with this tool you'll optimize your content and show up more on google searches! That's what we want, yes?\n\nâ\n\nHow does Content Score work?\n\nContent Score is a numerical value that ranges from 0 to 100, representing the quality of the content and its relevance to a given keyword.\n\nIn general, a score between:\n\n0 - 33 warns for irrelevant or low-quality content\n\n34 - 66 represents decent quality and relevance, or high quality with low relevance, or low quality with high relevance\n\n67 - 100 indicates optimum quality and relevance\n\nSurferâs algorithm ensures Content Score takes into account hundreds of on-page factors like:\n\nUsage of relevant words and phrases\n\nNatural Language Processing\n\nTitle and H1\n\nStructure of the headers\n\nContent length\n\nImages\n\nOriginal data\n\nHidden content\n\nMain keyword and partial keywords\n\nHow to use Content Score to improve your SEO?\n\nWith Content Score, analyze content quality in the pages ranking for your target keyword. You won't get the exact pointers to fix your content (just yet) but you'll get some refined suggestions for your burning questions.\n\nBurning question #1: Who is your competition and how do you tackle them?\n\nSmart content marketers know that concrete research for the next best piece doesn't just require good writing. It requires heavy competition research, analyzing every ranking page in SERP, understanding what each competing piece comprises, and recognizing patterns across multiple competitors. And like all things in an SEO game, it takes time and manual effort.\n\nContent Score automates all of it and some more. It tells you which competitors should be considered as a benchmark for your content. You can easily nit-pick them and reach after their score. Jump on the Content Editor and get started!\n\nBurning question #2: How can your next piece become the most compelling and SEO-optimized content out there?\n\nPatterns, patterns, patterns. Upping the rank of your content in SERP is all about adopting the models that work and shedding the ones that don't.\n\nIf you had to do it all manually, you could start an excel sheet with the following columns:\n\nNumber of headings (H1s, H2s, H3s)\n\nTypes of headings\n\nKeywords used (Main keywords, long-tail keywords, phrases)\n\nTotal paragraphs\n\nTotal word count\n\nCTAs\n\nImages and videos used (with alt text)\n\nYou know this list is endless!\n\nOne of the biggest superpowers of Content Score is to compute over 100 hundred such factors and tell you exactly what's missing: additional headings, more paragraphs, better structure â you name it, Content Score's got it. Added to the Content Editor, your writers will know how to create the most SEO-optimized, compelling piece of content in real-time.\n\nHow to write a high-graded article with Content Score?\n\nThe answer is simple and yet not so simple.\n\nHere's the simple part:\n\nWrite high-quality content that resonates with the reader's intent and expectations.\n\nFollow general SEO good practices.\n\nMake sure the content includes concise information that solves the reader's problem.\n\nEnsure proper vocabulary and semantics.\n\nHere's the not-so-simple part:\n\nUse the right keywords and entities related to the topic. (according to the rules of NLP in SEO).\n\nDivide the text structure into efficient paragraphs.\n\nAdd graphics like images and videos to enhance the reader's experience.\n\nWhat's more? The rules keep changing. Sometimes the time that your readers spend on the page matters. Other times it doesn't. And your content needs to accommodate for it.\n\nThere's a shortcut to a higher Content Score.\n\nFollow the guidelines in Surferâs Content Editor.\n\nWrite new pieces while optimizing for SEO.\n\nOptimize old content to meet today's SEO standard.\n\nRank higher to increase organic traffic.\n\nLastly, save yourself from the wrath of research that comes with being neck-deep into SEO.\n\nThe simplest way to write content with a high content score is by using Surfer AI.\n\nSurfer AI is a part of Content Editor and is designed to create long-form content that ranks in search engine results.\n\nHead to Surfer Content Editor and select the Write with AI tab.\n\nEnter between 1-5 primary keywords\n\nSelect your country and device preferences\n\nClick the Create button\n\nYou will be asked to select a few options in order to create a customized article for your website.\n\nThese will include choosing the following:\n\nblog format\n\ntone of voice\n\norganic competitors\n\nanti AI detection\n\narticle outline\n\nIn about twenty minutes, Surfer will generate a fully optimized article with a high content score.\n\nIf you prefer to write yourself, and are looking for specifics to increase the score and value of your content, continue reading.\n\nMain heading, Title, H1\n\nMake sure your H1 reflects what the content holds. It's good SEO practice to add your main target keyword to the H1. And depending on what type of content you're writing, think whether it should be a question, statement, or sentence. Understand the context and frame your H1 accordingly. Don't make promises you can't fulfill.\n\nOther headings like H2, H3, H4s\n\nToday's internet readers are skimmers. Until they confirm that your content is adding value, they don't spend time reading every word. Their natural step is to scan websites and hunt for specific information. If you hide what your reader is looking for in wordy paragraphs, they quickly drop off. It indicates to Google that your content is not helpful.\n\nThe appropriate heading structure is crucial to catch their attention.Â\n\nUse multiple headers from H2 to H6.\n\nUse the main keyword, partial keywords, long-tail keywords, and query words in headers.\n\nUse highly relevant words and phrases from Googleâs NLP or True Density.\n\nThere is no \"right amount of keywords\". Each query is different. They must be analyzed separately to find optimal keyword density.\n\nSurfer's Content Editor and Content Score automatically ensure that your content piece is optimized for such guidelines. Find out more in our article about how to write SEO content or Audit with the True Density section.\n\nPlain text or paragraphs\n\nYour content obviously can't all be Headings. Paragraphs play an immense role in evaluating your Content Score. Make the most out of different paragraphs and sections in your content piece.\n\nInclude a decent mix of exact keywords, query words, partial keywords, True Density phrases, and NLP entities.\n\nTake care of the optimal structure of the first 100 words or your first fold. Include the exact keyword to increase relevance.\n\nStick to the proper text length.\n\nProvide an author, if possible.\n\nMention content from sources that have high domain authority (DA) scores\n\nDivide the text into easily digestible paragraphs.\n\nImages\n\nGood content pieces are not always all words. They should appeal to different audiences, even the kind who engage better with images and videos. To make things easier, use an AI video generator to create engaging videos, especially if you don't have the resources for in-house video production.\n\nSurfer's Content Score also evaluates how many images or videos are present in the top-performing SERP pages and tells you what the best number is for you.\n\nWhat can stop your content from ranking higher?\n\nGoogle is very serious about barring malicious or ill-fitted content. And they determine it by looking at poor SEO practices like:\n\nKeyword stuffing in H1\n\nDuplicating H1\n\nKeyword stuffing in content\n\nThe presence of hidden content\n\nA lot of âfluffâ content with no value to a reader\n\nWall of text, with no bullets and headings\n\nHigher drop-off rates\n\nSummary\n\nContent marketers often battle between writing quality content and creating SEO-optimized content. It shouldn't have to be that way.\n\nThe best-performing content is a perfect mix of both. And while only knowledgeable humans can write the best quality content, SEO tools can help get more eyeballs at the same content.\n\nWe built Content Score into Surfer with the same mission in mind. We wanted to empower Content Marketers, SEO writers, and just about anybody to write quality content that ranks."
