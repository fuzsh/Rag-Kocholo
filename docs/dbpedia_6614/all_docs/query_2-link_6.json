        "text": "Summary+\n\nPornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” exists in many forms across the internet including pictures, videos, audio, written materials, video games, and social media posts. A majority of the US population has intentionally viewed pornography before, with an even larger majority of US young adults viewing pornography regularly. Despite the widespread use of and support for pornography, viewing sexually explicit“Sexually explicit means a pictorial depiction of actual or simulated sexual acts including [but not limited to] sexual intercourse, oral sex, or masturbation.” media can have many negative consequences. For example, pornography use has been shown to correlate with decreased sex-life satisfaction, lack of positive self-image, and increased chances of divorce. Research also shows that both pornography viewers and pornography actors are likely to experience emotional health consequences. Two of the reasons people consume pornography so frequently are because the content has addictive properties and because it is widely marketed on the internet and therefore easily accessed. Likewise, the pornography industry generates massive amounts of revenue, which continually fuel the creation and advertising of new pornography. While there are many resources available to combat pornography use, the main practice to decrease pornography is to publicize its negative consequences and alert people to the risks they assume when they view sexually explicit content.\n\nKey Takeaways+\n\nPornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” exists on 12% of all websites1 and is viewed by approximately 69% of American men and 40% of American women in any given year.2\n\nSupport and public opinion for pornography have increased among young adults in the last several decades.3\n\nOne reason for the creation and circulation of pornography is the lucrative nature of the industry—in 2023 the Adult & Pornographic Websites industry in the United States was on track to match the revenue of the NCAA at $1.15 billion.4,5\n\nUsing pornography correlates with decreased sex-life satisfaction,6 increased desire for rough or violent sex,7 and increased chances of divorce.8\n\nAdult film performersRefers to an individual who acts professionally in pornography films. face a range of challenging issues including mental and emotional well-being (such as depression, eating disorders, and even suicide), financial struggles, physical and sexual health risks (including STDs and body modifications), strained relationships, and the distressing reality of systematic support for sexual abuse and rape.\n\nPornography is often overlooked largely due to the prevailing pro-porn sentiment among the general public. However, research confirms the negative consequences, and organizations are emerging to combat what has been deemed as the “porndemic.”9\n\nKey Terms+\n\nAddiction—“Compulsive, chronic, physiological or psychological need for a habit-forming substance, behavior, or activity having harmful physical, psychological, or social effects and typically causing well-defined symptoms.\"10\n\nAdult Film Performers—Refers to an individual who is paid to act in pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” films.\n\nAmateur Porn Stars—“Non-professionals performing with little pay, or actors for whom this material is not their only paid modeling work.”11\n\nIncentive Salience—A theory about brain function particularly relevant in describing the neural patterns of addicts. The theory suggests that “it is possible to ‘want’ what is not expected to be liked, nor remembered to be liked, as well as what is not actually liked when obtained.”12\n\nObscenity—A US legal term for “lewd, filthy, or disgusting words or pictures.” Each state has different laws defining what is considered obscene.13\n\nPornhub—One of the largest websites dedicated to publishing pornography. The site is owned by a larger company called MindGeek.14\n\nPorn stars—Jargon referring to a person who is famous for starring in pornographic films.15 The term usually references adult film performers, as opposed to amateur or independent pornography creators.\n\nPornography—“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.”16\n\nSexually explicit—“Sexually explicit means a pictorial depiction of actual or simulated sexual acts including [but not limited to] sexual intercourse, oral sex, or masturbation.”17\n\nSexual scripts—Learned ideas about sex that “suggest what events should and should not be happening, how people should behave in response to what is or is not happening, and what the outcomes of particular courses of action should be.”18\n\nA: One survey found that Americans ages 13 and older consider content pornographic if it is sexually explicit“Sexually explicit means a pictorial depiction of actual or simulated sexual acts including [but not limited to] sexual intercourse, oral sex, or masturbation.”, displays sexual intercourse, displays sexual acts, is intended for the arousal of the viewer, or contains full nudity.30 Regarding personal feelings for or against pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.”, a separate study from 2019, showed that 14% of Americans agree or strongly agree that pornography is morally wrong, while 51% disagree or strongly disagree.31 These statistics give a good general sense of America’s opinion, but perceptions vary according to age and gender. One study shows that young adults and men are generally more likely than their older or female counterparts to support pornography staying legal.31 When asked if individuals believed pornography is “very bad” for society, 37% of baby boomers agree, whereas only 14% of today’s young adults agree, which reveals a 23 percentage point decrease between the generations. This margin holds true when comparing men’s and women’s answers regarding the same question: 21% of men agree that pornography is “very bad” while 39% of women agree.33 A previously cited study shows that public perception has swung more in favor of pornography in the last 40 years. In the 1970s, an average of 29.6% of men and 45.2% of women believed that pornography should be illegal. In 2012, those percentages dropped to 18.4% and 35% respectively.34\n\nThe first court case that came before the Supreme Court regarding obscenityA US legal term for “lewd, filthy, or disgusting words or pictures.” Each state has different laws defining what is considered obscene. was Roth vs United States in 1957. Over the next 10 years, litigation collaborated with the American Library Association (ALA) in efforts to further pinpoint the concept of obscenity while not overstepping the First Amendment. As a result, various definitions were created.53 Per the current state of the US judicial system, obscenity is defined through the use of the Miller Test, which bases its judgment on the “average person’s” perception of prurient interest, offensive sexual conduct, literary, artistic, political, or scientific appeals.54 A big step in litigation against pornography came in 1968 when Congress passed the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography.55 They primarily focused on research surrounding constitutionality, traffic, and pornography’s effect on youth. It was the first government-funded research project for studying pornography and its effects on users in 1969.56 After its launch, many other studies were conducted, including one in 1986 which concluded that the pornography industry needed to be stopped for the sake of American morality.57\n\nA significant body of research does show that pornographic content has the potential to stimulate a user’s brain in ways that resemble addictive brain patterns.63 People suffering from any type of addiction demonstrate a psychological phenomenon called incentive salienceA theory about brain function particularly relevant in describing the neural patterns of addicts. The theory suggests that “it is possible to ‘want’ what is not expected to be liked, nor remembered to be liked, as well as what is not actually liked when obtained.”. A theory about brain function particularly relevant in describing the neural patterns of addicts. The theory suggests that “it is possible to ‘want’ what is not expected to be liked, nor remembered to be liked, as well as what is not actually liked when obtained.”. In other words, their desire to obtain certain “rewards” is detached from their actual enjoyment of those “rewards” (unlike non-addicted people whose desires for and enjoyment of “rewards” are proportionate). Problematic pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” users experience incentive salience. Many users feel heightened impulses to seek out the “reward” of pornography, but once it is obtained, the actual enjoyment of watching the pornography is lacking. This discrepancy is shown in a 2017 brain scan study. Participants with PPU scored higher than their non-PPU counterparts on “wanting” pornography: their reaction times to clicking a button that would give them a pornographic “reward” was quicker. But all participants (regardless of previous pornography usage) were roughly equal in their scores for enjoying the pornography; they all showed similar blood oxygen levels in the reward center of their brains.64 This study suggests that people with problematic pornography usage experience incentive salienceA theory about brain function particularly relevant in describing the neural patterns of addicts. The theory suggests that “it is possible to ‘want’ what is not expected to be liked, nor remembered to be liked, as well as what is not actually liked when obtained.”. A separate study corroborates that theory. Researchers found that individuals with “unregulated” pornography use (PPU) reported more negative attitudes toward pornography than individuals who used pornography frequently without out-of-control habits. According to the researchers, this supports the incentive salience theory because individuals with PPU are using pornography more but getting less fulfillment out of it.65\n\nThe spread of the world wide web allowed for an increase in both access and exposure to pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” among young adults. In 2021, 98% of pornography accessed by young adults was internet porn, with a majority (69%) viewed on a cell phone.69 To illustrate how much people really view pornography on their cell phones, the data company Statista published that 20% of all mobile searches are for pornography.70 These searches can easily lead viewers to what they are looking for as at least 4 million websites on the internet feature pornographic content. That equates to approximately 12% of all websites.71 The average internet user in the United States visits 130 sites daily.72 To put these statistics into perspective, if 1 person only visited pornography websites, it would take approximately 84 years to access all the pornography websites on the internet. Given that 93.6% of the US population uses the internet73,74 and that 88.6% gain internet access on a handheld smartphone,75 the vast majority of people have pornography available to them regularly.\n\nWith pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” access facilitated, more young adults in America are intentionally consuming pornography through the internet. A cross-generational study examining pornography consumption over the last 40 years corroborates this: researchers surveyed men in various age cohorts and found that young adults in the mid-2000s consumed more pornography than young adults in the 1970s. Of the men who were 18–26 years old during the years 1973–1980, approximately 45% were classified as having consumed pornography in the previous year. Of the 18–26-year-olds in the 1999–2012 cohort, approximately 61% had consumed pornography, revealing a 16 percentage point increase.76 This study also suggests that the invention of the internet most likely influenced the increase in pornography consumption—researchers drew this conclusion because they saw a 10% increase in pornography consumption from young adult males in previous decades to those in the 1990s (when the internet became popular).77 Other research found that young people took advantage of increased access to internet pornography by using it for tips and ideas about how to have sex, as opposed to asking parents and friends for that information, which used to be the norm.78\n\nThe flourishing pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” industry serves as a catalyst for increased pornographic content, fueled by growing sales that motivate the creation and promotion of more content. According to IBISWorld, a company that analyzes commercial industries, the porn industry has experienced a 12.6% increase in revenue per year between 2018 and 2023.84 In contrast, the sports industry only had a constant 6% increase in revenue during the same time period.85 Like every other commercial sector, the desire for more recurring customers drives the pornography industry to provide a product that customers are willing to pay for, to market it to them, and to retain their business by maintaining customer interest in company goods and services.86,87 From a business standpoint, if the industry wasn’t lucrative, it would not exist. But considering that in 2023 the Adult & Pornographic Websites industry in the United States was on track to make $1.15 billion88 (roughly matching the revenue of the NCAA89 ), the porn industry is financially thriving and motivated to continue publishing pornography and pursuing customers.\n\nThe porn industry also uses business strategies to gain and maintain customers. For example, some pornography websites use the cookies and cache on an individual’s computer to alert other pornography distributors to their interests and preferences. This system of tailored advertising may contribute to a casual user transforming into an addict.102 Big pornography websites such as PornhubOne of the largest websites dedicated to publishing pornography. The site is owned by a larger company called MindGeek. also use a strategic and consumer-aware marketing strategy. Marketing strategists analyze consumer behavior and can see the hourly difference in website traffic due to external factors such as the launch of a new video game.103 Also, during COVID-19, Pornhub made its content free to countries in lockdown.104 The assumption is that by making pornography free during the lockdown, some viewers would choose to purchase a subscription later once the lockdown and free pornography ended. These tactics are just a few of the factors that contributed to the forecasted 15% compound annual growth rate for the online porn industry from 2022 to 2030.105\n\nPeople who use pornography put themselves at risk of developing distorted views of sex, which can harm their sexual well-being. In one study of young males ages 14 to 20, participants who viewed pornography reported self-consciousness about their ability to perform sexually. They expressed anxiety about their ability to perform to the extent and for the duration that porn starsJargon referring to a person who is famous for starring in pornographic films. The term usually references adult film performers, as opposed to amateur or independent pornography creators. performed.106 When asked about their sex life satisfaction, approximately 41% of men who had not watched pornography the day before reported high satisfaction, whereas only 26% of men who had watched pornography during the same time period reported the same.107 For young women, the research found that watching extensive amounts of sexual content on TV correlated with an increased chance of teen pregnancy. The survey specifically concluded that participants who were in the 90th percentile for watching sex on TV were twice as likely to experience teen pregnancy as participants who were in the 10th percentile. 108 Pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” can also enforce attitudes of sexual objectification,109 which can lead to increased sexual violence. One recent US study analyzed a sample of pornography videos for themes of male aggression and female submission. Results showed that 88.2% of the videos involved some type of rough sex (spanking, gagging, and so forth), and 49% of the videos showed the female actor complying with and enjoying the aggression.110 Other content portrays nonconsensual sexual aggression and even rape.111 A study that examined the titles of pornographic videos on 3 popular pornography sites concluded that sexually violent content is advertised in the titles of 12% of all pornographic videos—that is 1 in every 8.112\n\nThe prevalence of violent pornography raises the question of whether or not those who watch violent pornography also engage in violent sex. Research found that violent sex depends on whether the viewer adopts the sexual scriptsLearned ideas about sex that “suggest what events should and should not be happening, how people should behave in response to what is or is not happening, and what the outcomes of particular courses of action should be.” of the pornography,113 and it suggested that young people were susceptible to adopting sexual beliefs and ideas from the content they view.114 A developmental psychology study concluded that using pornography at a young age can increase a person’s likelihood of sexually harassing a peer or of forcing sex on someone.115 A 2019 study found that participants who reported a higher frequency of viewing pornography were more likely to have a history of engaging in rough sex and to report a higher desire for participating.116\n\nThe poor spending habits and lifestyles of the adult film world have many financial consequences for the performers. One qualitative study that sampled 134 female performers, stated that in the past 12 months, 50% of adult performers reported living in poverty.146 The universal definition of poverty is when an individual or community lacks access to resources for basic necessities to live a healthy and dignified life. As a result, individuals are unable to afford medical care or access to basics such as electricity, shelter, and food.147 Among peers in the same region, the poverty rate was 36%, creating a large 14-point gap for actors in the porn industry.148 This gap is due to the poor spending habits and lifestyles adopted by performers. Many performers spend their money quickly and are often in large amounts of debt, with no concept of saving.149 One performer explained, “They go out there and party their money away, risk it all, do drugs, sniff it all up in their nose, because it all comes so fast and easy and they know the next day they can go and make $2,000.”\n\nAbuse of all kinds is present and apparent in the Adult Film Industry, whereas prosecution and legal protection are close to invisible. Again, the data presented here represent female performers simply due to a lack of data on the male side. It is important to note that young girls (before even entering the industry) are more than twice as likely to have been victims of forced sex or rape. Studies showed that nearly 40% of female performers had experience with rape.153 These adult film performersRefers to an individual who acts professionally in pornography“Sexually explicit media that are primarily intended to sexually arouse the audience.” films. were also 5 times as likely to be placed in foster care and twice as likely to live in poverty.154 Upon entering the industry, sexual violence and abuse only increased. Performers reported experiencing hair-pulling, choking, and consensual acts that injured them.155 In 2011, 34% of female performers reported domestic violence and 27% reported forced sex and rape.156 While not all pornography is abusive and violent, there are certain genres and companies where mistreatment is found more frequently. One Adult Film Company was reported to beating performers and shooting many scenes highlighting rape and harsh violence.157\n\nIn addition to academic sources, there are also more personal and less academic sources that do exist about amateur pornography. One example is the work of Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, who, together, have directed and produced the documentary films entitled Sexy Baby (2012), Hot Girls Wanted (2015), and the documentary series Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On (2017). While these are not peer-reviewed sources nor research-based data, these are real girls with real stories.158 In Hot Girls Wanted (2015) the film follows Tressa Silguero, Ava Taylor, Brooklyn Daniels, Ava Kelly, and Allie Rae in the amateur porn industry in Florida. They were recruited by “agent” Gavin Evans through Facebook ads with the promise of a free ticket to Florida. From the film, it is clear that there is no shortage of applications, as girls cycle through about every 3–6 months. The girls then lived together in-house and began creating an online following via social media.159 Many girls experienced sexual health problems due to the excessive amount of sexual activity, dysfunction in familial and romantic relationships, poor mental health, emotional stress of being ridiculed by peers, as well as physical, verbal, racial, and sexual abuse experienced while on the job with coworkers and peers.160\n\nThe impact of Defend Young Minds is found most frequently on an individual basis. Though there is a lack of longitudinal studies with children using the program, other longitudinal studies show the positive effects of education through safe family environments and schools. In one study, it was found that those who had witnessed intense, high-risk, sexual scenes through the media participated in sexually aggressive behaviors 4 times as intense as those who had not seen pornography.191 Considering that it was reported that 85% of young people have seen or have been exposed to pornography and yet 62.62% reported not having had any sexual education concerning pornography, we believe that more education such as what Defend Young Minds is offering can make a significant impact on how children respond to their unintentional exposures.192,193 Another study supported this, concluding that the more parents and children have open communication about sexual health issues including pornography, children are more likely to make better decisions about sex.194"
