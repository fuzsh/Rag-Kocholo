        "text": "Online presence and recognition is important, but it was always hard to measure it for your business, event, or campaign. Brand24 created the online Presence Score – a metric that helps you understand awareness around your company, competitors, or topics of your interest.\n\nIt is important for many types of businesses to build and maintain an online presence. Online presence helps to raise awareness of your business, grow sales, reach new customers, form relationships with clients, control and maintain a positive reputation of your company.\n\nOnline presence reflects in many various forms. You can improve your online presence by running social media accounts, creating online campaigns, having conversations and engaging with clients, responding to online reviews.\n\nIf you run a small, offline business, sometimes you may not know about having an online presence, or think you don’t need one. Nothing further from the truth.\n\nSome companies may underestimate the importance of being present online, creating their own image online, knowing what is being said about their business, and forming bonds with customers online.\n\nOnline presence should be managed and monitored. It’s important to stay in control of it and know how your business, event, campaign, or industry performs online.\n\nHere is where online Presence Score comes in handy!\n\nContents:\n\nWhat is the online Presence Score?\n\nHow to check the online Presence Score?\n\nWhy should you measure the online Presence Score?\n\nExamples of online Presence Score\n\nHow is the online Presence Score measured?\n\nWhat is the online Presence Score?\n\nBrand24, a media monitoring tool, now delivers even more AI-powered insights as it came up with its original online Presence Score.\n\nOnline Presence Score is a metric that indicates how is your online presence performing and helps to understand the online popularity of a certain company or topic at the given time.\n\nOnline Presence Score delivers valuable insights and can help you draw many conclusions. Online presence score can be used to:\n\nCompare your online exposure versus your competitors;\n\nLearn if you need to work on your online presence;\n\nEvaluate your marketing & PR efforts;\n\nCheck if your business has a strong brand awareness or not;\n\nLearn the popularity of a certain topic or industry that you are interested in;\n\nCheck the online popularity of certain events;\n\nMeasure and benchmark brand awareness.\n\nHow to check the online Presence Score?\n\nBrand24 came up with a new metric – Presence Score, that measures the online exposure of a certain brand or topic. This is 100% our metric that you can’t find in any other media monitoring tool.\n\nTo check the Presence Score for your business, event, campaign, or topic of your interests, all you need to do is start a monitoring project and track keywords connected to it.\n\nAs soon as you start your monitoring project, the tool will start collecting mentions from all over the Web. Obviously, the volume of discussion about Black Friday has its peak in the end of November.\n\nPresence Score is available in the Analysis tab. As you can see, Black Friday’s Presence Score definitely rose in November as well.\n\nLooking at the Presence Score for Black Friday you can see that it’s wise to start your sales campaigns at the beginning of November or even end of October, when the interest starts to rise. This may be obvious for Black Friday, but whenever you are not sure when to start advertising for an annual event, you might want to analyse its Presence Score to see when it gets more engagement.\n\nWhy should you measure the online Presence Score\n\nThe question arises, why should you measure your presence score, and how does it translate to your online reputation?\n\nThe Brand24 Online Presence Score allows you to compare your brand to the competitors in terms of visibility. It is a great tool to see if your PR and marketing teams are doing good job or you need to improve your efforts.\n\nNot only you are able to see how popular your brand is against the competition, but also you can see it on a timeline. The Presence Score changes over time and you will see on the chart when it was higher or lower. Then you can check what marketing or PR campaigns were active during that period of time, and benchmark it against competing companies in your market niche.\n\nThe Presence Score will help you to build brand awareness when used skilfully.\n\nExamples of online Presence Score\n\nSeeing a couple more examples of Presence Scores will let you understand this metric even more. It will allow you to think about even more ways on how useful and valuable it is.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir is a popular, publicly-traded software company, which Presence Score rose from 61 to 71 in early October 2020. Why did that happen?\n\nA boost in Presence Score was related to Palantir going public. There was a visible spike in reach and the number of mentions on September 30, which affected the Presence Score.\n\nThis type of data can help to calculate how Palantir’s overall brand awareness is affected by discussion related to the Stock Exchange. Presence Score can be also used to benchmark Palantir’s online brand awareness versus closest competitors.\n\nSee how your brand is performing online versus your competitors\n\nCES 2021\n\nLet’s have a closer look at CES 2021 – Tech Event / Exhibition happening on 11-14 Jan 2021 now. For a number of days, CES-related discussions dominated tech conversations all over the Web. These conversations reflected on CES 2021’s Presence Score.\n\nUsing Presence Score can help to benchmark CES media exposure versus previous CES editions as well as rival events. It can be also a vital contributor to CES brand awareness calculation.\n\nBrightonSEO\n\nBrightonSEO is one of the biggest SEO conferences in Europe that gathers thousands of SEO and marketing experts in one place. Their Presence Score is 35 as of October 2023, but it dropped down from 45 in September. Why?\n\nWell, the answer is simple. The conference was held on September 14-15, 2023.\n\nIt’s a natural process that the target customers are talking more about the event while it’s happening (also directly before and after), and after a while the interest and the number of online interactions fades. The organizers can, however, bear in mind the fact that they have much lower visibility during the rest of the year and plan their campaigns accordingly.\n\nHow is the online Presence Score measured?\n\nThe two most significant Presence Score contributors are the number of mentions and their total reach (based on impressions they potentially generated).\n\nThe more mentions and reach – the more substantial the Presence Score.\n\nMeaning behind your online Presence Score\n\nPresence Score operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is a score achieved by globally recognizable brands and very popular topics.\n\nPresence Score growth speed decreases with progress, which means that it is much more challenging to grow the Presence Score from 70 to 80 than from 10 to 20."
