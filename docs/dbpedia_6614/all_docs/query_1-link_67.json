Each topic will be set-up as a question group and has a set of sub question where the individual has to rate themselves using an optional scale for a total of four questions under each question group.\n\nWhat I want the logic to do is apply whichever number they pick from each question to the total score for that question group and then once they have made their way through each question group and sub questions the end to push them to a page reflecting whichever question group they scored lowest by how they rated themselves within the three sections, which the lowest scoring section being the one they need to work on the most.\n\nI cant find the logic to do this as it seems to add as a total and cant add in groups and serve the lowest, is there a way of doing this?\n\nThanks!\n\nMonet"
