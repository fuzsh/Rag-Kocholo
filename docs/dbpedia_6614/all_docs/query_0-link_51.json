        "text": "What is low vision?\n\nLow vision is a permanent visual impairment that you can’t correct with glasses, contacts or surgery. Most eye doctors define low vision as moderate to severe visual impairment — enough to inhibit your everyday activities, like driving and reading.\n\nTerms like “partially sighted” and “legally blind” fall under the larger heading of low vision. But these terms also have more specific meanings. In the U.S., these refer to whether you qualify for special education or disability services for visual impairment.\n\nLow vision may involve a variety of different types of visual impairment; not just nearsightedness or farsightedness, but also peripheral vision loss, a blind spot or blurred vision. You might have OK vision in some ways but still have low vision overall.\n\nLow vision isn’t total blindness — some vision remains. Vision rehabilitation services help people with low vision make the most of what they’ve got. A specialist can help connect you with low vision aids and assistive technology to make your life easier.\n\nWhat qualifies as low vision on a visual acuity test?\n\nThe standard visual acuity test in the U.S. is the Snellen eye chart. It measures the clarity of your vision at a distance of 20 feet from an object. If you have 20/20 vision, which is the average score, it means you can see an object clearly from 20 feet away.\n\nIf your score is 20/70, it means that your vision at 20 feet is like normal vision at 70 feet. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies this score as moderate visual impairment or moderate low vision. A score of 20/200 or above qualifies as severe low vision.\n\nBut this isn’t the only score eye specialists consider. Other types of tests measure other aspects of your vision. For example, a visual field test measures your range of vision from side to side. Having a visual field of 20 degrees or less also qualifies as low vision.\n\nSome people have low scores on vision tests, but they’re able to correct their impairment with glasses, contacts or surgery. If these treatments make your test scores go up, you don’t have low vision. Low vision is a condition you have even with your glasses on.\n\nHow do eye specialists treat low vision?\n\nWhen you see an optometrist specializing in low vision, they’ll give you a special kind of exam called a low vision exam. They’ll begin by taking a complete history of your eye health, and then ask about how your condition is currently affecting your life.\n\nThey’ll ask you how low vision affects your:\n\nSchool or work.\n\nReading and computer use.\n\nDriving.\n\nFunctioning in the kitchen.\n\nFacial recognition.\n\nAbility to travel.\n\nHobbies and leisure activities.\n\nMood and social life.\n\nThe provider will also examine your eyes and vision to look for any changes in your condition. They’ll use special low vision test charts to evaluate your visual acuity.\n\nThey might also need to check your:\n\nField of vision.\n\nEye muscle function.\n\nGlare sensitivity.\n\nContrast sensitivity.\n\nNight vision.\n\nColor vision.\n\nDepth perception.\n\nReading ability.\n\nBased on the results of your exam, a low vision specialist will design a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific difficulties and needs. They’ll offer resources and recommendations to help you adapt and optimize your quality of life.\n\nVision rehabilitation\n\nTreatment for low vision is called vision rehabilitation. The goal of the treatment is to maximize your vision as much as possible and otherwise help you live as independently as possible with the vision you have. This may involve a wide variety of resources.\n\nYour plan might include:\n\nLow vision aids and devices\n\nYou might benefit from:\n\nA prescription for glasses or contact lenses.\n\nOptical magnifiers or telescopes.\n\nElectronic magnifiers and screen readers.\n\nLarge print and high contrast products.\n\nVoice-to-text and audio reading technology.\n\nAudible home devices.\n\nPractical training and support\n\nYou might also benefit from:\n\nOccupational therapy to learn new ways to perform tasks.\n\nA mobility specialist to help you learn to get around.\n\nA rehabilitation instructor to teach you independent living skills.\n\nSpecial education or vocational services.\n\nCounseling or psychotherapy to maintain your mental health.\n\nSupport groups that connect you with others living with low vision."
