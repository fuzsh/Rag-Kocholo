        "text": "PURPOSE: This rule explains how medical and marijuana facility licensing and certification applications, with the exception of seed-to-sale tracking system entity applications, are submitted and how the Department of Health of Senior Services selects licenses and certificates.\n\n(1) Conversion from a medical facility license to a comprehensive facility license.(A) A medical facility licensee may request its medical facility license convert to a comprehensive facility license.1. Conversion requests must be submitted in a department- provided, web-based application system.2. Conversion requests shall include a plan that explains how the applicant will serve both the medical and adult-use markets, while maintaining adequate supply at a reasonable cost to qualifying patients.3. Conversion requests shall include a plan to promote and encourage participation in the regulated marijuana industry by people from communities that have been disproportionately impacted by marijuana prohibition.4. Conversion requests shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of two thousand dollars ($2000).5. A conversion request is deemed received when all required documents and fees are received by the department.6. The department shall approve or deny conversion requests by email to the licensee's designated contact within sixty (60) days after the conversion request is received. Conversion requests not processed within sixty (60) days of department receipt shall be deemed approved.7. If the comprehensive facility previously received approval to operate as a medical facility, the comprehensive licensee may begin operating without additional approvals or inspections from the department. If the comprehensive facility did not previously receive approval to operate as a medical facility, the comprehensive licensee may not operate until it requests a commencement inspection and receives approval to operate as a comprehensive facility.8. A conversion request will be granted unless the medical facility licensee is not in good standing with the department. Good standing means the license is not suspended or revoked at the time the request is made.(B) Converted comprehensive licenses will retain the same expiration date assigned to the medical license.(2) Facility application process.(A) The department will publish on its website time periods during which it will accept applications and, when applicable, publish the number of licenses to be selected by lottery. The department may extend an existing application time period by posting a new application deadline on its website.(B) Applications will be considered complete if the application includes all documents required for applications by this rule.(C) The department will receive applications for all medical and marijuana facility licenses or certifications electronically through a department-provided, web-based application system. In the event of application system unavailability, the department will arrange to accept applications in an alternative, department-provided format and will notify the public of those arrangements through its website.1. The department shall charge each applicant seeking an available medical or marijuana facility license an application fee to be submitted with the application. The department shall publish the current fees, including any adjustments, on its website.2. Application fees are nonrefundable, except that a microbusiness facility applicant not chosen by lottery may request a refund of its application fee.A. Requests for a refund will be accepted beginning thirty-one (31) days after the date of the denial but no later than six (6) months after the date of the denial.B. The application fee will be refunded if the department determines the microbusiness facility applicant met the criteria to apply for a microbusiness facility license and the applicant has no pending or future legal actions related to the denial of the application. Issuance of a refund is not a determination from the department that the applicant is qualified for licensure or is entitled to a license in future applications(D) The issuance of a facility license or certification does not authorize the facility licensee to begin activities related to marijuana authorized by the license. A facility licensee will be granted final approval to operate upon passing a commencement inspection.(E) A facility license or certification shall be valid for three (3) years from its date of issuance.(3) Application requirements. Entities must obtain a license or certification to operate a medical or marijuana facility in Missouri.

The assigned identifiers will be transmitted to the entity conducting the lottery. The individual(s) conducting the lottery will do so without reference to the identities of the applicants.3. Identifiers will be randomly drawn and listed in the order drawn. If licenses are issued by congressional district, separate drawings will occur for each congressional district.4. After identifiers are drawn, the department will review the application corresponding to the selected identifier, beginning with the first identifier drawn, to determine if the applicant is eligible for licensure prior to issuing the license.A. Applicants are responsible for submitting a complete and accurate application as set out in this chapter. However, the department may request an applicant to provide additional information or documents needed to determine eligibility for a license by sending the request to the email address of the designated contact associated with the application.

If during the application review period, the department determines an application meets all of the license eligibility requirements in this chapter and Article XIV, the license will be issued.6. An application will be denied if-A. The application is not complete;B. The applicant, application, or any proposal in the application, is in violation of any rule in this chapter or Article XIV;C. Awarding a license would result in an entity being an owner in more licenses than permitted by Article XIV Section 2.3(9-11);D. The applicant provides false or misleading information in an application;E. The applicant fails to timely provide information or records requested by the department;F. An entity, which includes an individual, holds an ownership interest in more than one (1) microbusiness applicant in the same microbusiness application period, all microbusiness applications where the entity holds an ownership interest will be denied;G. The department determines an application fails to meet the license eligibility requirements in this chapter and Article XIV.7. If an application is denied, the department will review the next application in the order drawn until the available licenses or certifications are issued.8. Once all available licenses or certifications are issued, the remaining applications entered into the lottery for that application time period will be denied for failure to be selected in the lottery.(B) In cases where fewer applications are received in an application time period than there are available licenses or certifications, or for applications for licenses and certifications without a limit on the number to be issued, all complete applications meeting the license eligibility requirements in this chapter and Article XIV will be granted. Applications will be denied if subject to denial in paragraph (6)(A)6.(C) Any denial shall be issued by the department in writing to the applicant and shall include the specific reasons for the denial and the process for requesting review of the department's decision.(D) All applicants that are issued a license or certification will be given forty-eight (48) hours to confirm they accept the license or certification. Failure to accept the license or certification in this time frame may result in deactivation of the license or certification, and the department may then offer a license or certification to the next eligible applicant in the order drawn.(7) Renewals. Renewal requests must be submitted in a department-provided, web-based application system at least thirty (30) days, but no sooner than ninety (90) days, prior to expiration.(A) Renewal requests shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable renewal fee to be submitted with the request. The department shall publish the current fees, including any adjustments, on its website at http://cannabis.mo.gov.(B) A renewal request is deemed received when both the request and renewal fee is received by the department.(C) Except for good cause, a renewal request will be granted unless the facility licensee is not in good standing with the department. Good standing means the license is not suspended or revoked at the time the request is made.\n\nPURPOSE: The Department of Health and Senior Services has the authority to establish security requirements for any premises licensed or certified under Article XIV, Sections 1 and 2 of the Missouri Constitution.
