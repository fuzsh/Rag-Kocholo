The group members each receive the averageof these individual scores.\n\nmay provide motivation for students to focus on both individual and group work and thereby develop in both areas\n\nmay be perceived as unfair by students\n\nstronger students may be unfairly disadvantaged by weaker ones and vice versa\n\nIndividual Grade - Allocated task\n\nEach student completes an allocated task that contributes to the final group product and gets the marks for that task\n\na relatively objective way of ensuring individual participation\n\nmay provide additional motivation to students\n\npotential to reward outstanding performance\n\ndifficult to find tasks that are exactly equal in size/complexity\n\ndoes not encourage the group process/collaboration\n\ndependencies between tasks may slow progress of some\n\nIndividual Grade - Examination\n\nExam questions specifically target the group projects, and can only be answered by students who have been thoroughly involved in the project\n\nmay increase motivation to learn from the group project including learning from the other members of the group\n\nmay diminish importance of group work\n\nadditional work for staff in designing exam questions\n\nmay not be effective, students may be able to answer the questions by reading the group reports\n\nStudent distribution of pool of marks\n\nInstructor awards a set number of scores and let the group decide how to distribute them.\n\nExample: 4 member group\n\nProduct grade: 80/100.\n\n4 * 80 = 320 pts to be distributed.\n\nNo one student can be given less than zero or more than 100.\n\nIf members decide that they all contributed equally then each get 80\n\nIf they decided that person A deserved much more, then A might get 95, and the remaining if equal would get 75.\n\neasy to implement\n\nmay motivate students to contribute more\n\nnegotiation skills become part of the learning process\n\npotential to reward outstanding performance\n\nmay be perceived as fairer than shared or average group mark alone\n\nopen to subjective evaluation by friends\n\nmay lead to conflict\n\nmay foster competition and therefore be counterproductive to team work\n\nstudents may not have the skills necessary for the required negotiation"
