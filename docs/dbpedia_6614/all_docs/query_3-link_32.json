The current regulations surrounding pornography vary from state to state, making it hard to keep track of all the rules and regulations.\n\nThis guide is meant to provide you with an overview of the current legal situation in the UK regarding pornography. We’ll cover topics such as age restrictions, content regulation, and censorship, so you can better understand your rights when it comes to porn in the UK.\n\nThe UK’s Pornography Laws\n\nIn the United Kingdom, pornography is legal. However, there are restrictions on what kind of pornography can be produced and distributed. For example, it is illegal to produce or distribute pornography that depicts violence or sexual acts with animals. It is also illegal to distribute pornography to minors\n\nThere are a few different ways that someone could break the law when it comes to pornography. First, by producing or distributing pornographic material that involves violence or bestiality, a person could be charged with publishing an obscene article. This is punishable by up to two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nAnother way a person could break the law is by possessing or viewing child pornography. Child pornography is defined as any pornographic material that depicts someone under the age of 18 engaged in sexual activity. Possessing child pornography is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. Viewing child pornography is not currently a criminal offence in the UK but could be soon if new legislation proposed by the government is passed.\n\nWhat Was The 2019 ‘Porn Law’ And What Does It Cover?\n\nIn 2019, the UK government passed a law banning certain types of pornography.

It also criminalises the possession of child pornography. The maximum sentence for breaking the law is 10 years in prison.\n\nThe porn law has been controversial since it was first proposed.

Others believe that it is necessary to protect children from harm.\n\nWhat is classified as pornography in the UK?\n\nPornography is classified as anything that is intended to cause sexual excitement and is generally considered to be harmful to minors.

This can be done online or offline, and often leads to the victim feeling humiliated and exposed. In 2016, a new law was introduced making it a specific offence to share revenge porn in England and Wales, with offenders facing up to 2 years in prison.\n\nProstitution-related materials\n\nPornography that shows people engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money (or anything else of value) is classed as prostitution-related material.

This includes images or videos that depict bestiality, necrophilia, child abuse, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.\n\nPossession of extreme pornography is a criminal offence under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. The maximum penalty for possessing extreme pornography is imprisonment for up to 3 years.\n\nDistributing or publishing extreme pornography is also a criminal offence under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

Distribution of extreme pornography is punishable by up to 7 years in prison and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nIt should be noted that simply viewing extreme pornography is not currently a criminal offence in the UK.

This includes both real and computer-generated images, as well as so-called “cartoon” or “anime” child pornography. Penalties for possessing or making such images can be up to 10 years in prison.\n\nAdditionally, it is also illegal in the UK to possess or create sexual images of anyone under the age of 18, even if they are consenting to the image being taken or created. This includes so-called “sexting” between minors. Penalties for possessing or making such images can also be up to 10 years in prison.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that it is also illegal in the UK to possess or distribute any kind of extreme pornography.

However, it is illegal to distribute or sell pornography. It is also illegal to possess or view child pornography.\n\nPossession of Pornographic Material: The Basics\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is legal for an individual to possess pornographic material in their own home. This includes magazines, videos, DVDs, and software. It is also legal to view online pornography. However, there are some restrictions on what types of pornography can be possessed and viewed. For example, it is illegal to possess or view child pornography.\n\nIt is also important to note that it is illegal to distribute or sell pornography in the UK. This means that individuals cannot share pornographic material with others, even if they are not selling it for profit. Additionally, it is illegal to produce or make pornographic material available for distribution. This includes posting online videos or images, as well as creating websites that offer access to such material.\n\nDistribution of Pornographic Material\n\nThere are no specific laws in the UK that prohibit the distribution of pornographic material. However, there are a number of laws that could potentially be used to prosecute those who distribute such material. These include laws against obscene publications, indecency, and public nuisance.\n\nThose who distribute pornography may also be liable for civil damages under defamation or privacy law. In addition, the distribution of child pornography is a criminal offence in the UK.\n\nIt is important to note that while the possession of pornography is not illegal in the UK, it is illegal to possess certain types of extreme pornography. This includes images or videos depicting bestiality, necrophilia, or violence that is realistically simulated. It is also illegal to possess or distribute so-called “prohibited images” of children, which include photographs or videos of children engaged in sexual activity or posed in a sexually suggestive manner.\n\nProduction of Pornographic Material\n\nProducing pornography is a criminal offence in the UK. This includes making, distributing or showing pornography.\n\nThe maximum sentence for producing pornography is 6 months in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The sentence for distributing or showing pornography is 3 months in prison and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nThere are a number of defences to these offences, including:\n\nIf the material is not considered to be pornographic (e.g. it is educational or satirical)\n\nIf the material is only intended for personal use and will not be distributed to others\n\nIf the production of the pornography was forced or coerced\n\nObscene Publications Act 1959\n\nThe Obscene Publications Act 1959 is a law in the United Kingdom that makes it illegal to publish or possess material that is considered to be obscene. The law applies to all forms of media, including books, magazines, films, and websites.\n\nThe test for whether something is considered obscene is whether it would tend to “deprave and corrupt” those who see it. This is a very low bar, and as a result, the Act has been used to ban a wide variety of materials, including some that are not traditionally thought of as pornography.\n\nOne well-known example of something that was banned under the Act is D. H. Lawrence’s novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover, which was first published in 1928. The book was not widely available in the UK until 1960, when a publisher released an edition with some changes made to the text in order to avoid violating the Act.\n\nCoroners and Justice Act 2009\n\nThe Coroners and Justice Act 2009 made it a criminal offence to possess “extreme pornographic images”. An “extreme image” is defined as one which depicts in an explicit and realistic way ANY of the following:\n\nAn act which threatens a person’s life\n\nAn act which results in or is likely to result in serious injury to a person’s anus, breasts or genitals\n\nAn act of sexual intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive)\n\nThe possession of such images is now punishable by up to 3 years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The law applies to both physical and digital images, meaning that it is also an offence to view extreme pornography online.\n\nThe intention of the law was to target those who create and distribute “realistic” depictions of extreme acts, rather than those who simply view them. However, there has been criticism that the definition of “extreme image” is too broad and could potentially criminalise people who view non-harmful consensual acts between adults (e.g. BDSM).\n\nPolice Powers\n\nThe police have a number of powers when it comes to pornography. They can seize and destroy any material that is deemed to be “obscene” or “offensive”. They can also arrest and charge anyone who is found to be in possession of such material.\n\nThe police can also take action against those who are involved in the production or distribution of pornographic material. This includes taking down websites and prosecuting those who are responsible for them.\n\nPornography laws in the UK are some of the most strict in the world. Possession of even a small amount of pornography can result in a prison sentence. The maximum sentence for possessing or distributing child pornography is 10 years in prison.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope that this guide to the pornography laws in the UK has been useful and informative. It is important to be aware of the law when it comes to using or accessing pornographic material, as engaging in activities which are illegal can have serious consequences. When viewing pornography, always do so responsibly and make sure you know what is and isn’t allowed. If you have any questions about what constitutes offensive material, contact your local police station for advice."
