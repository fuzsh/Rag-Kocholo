        "text": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user’s search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available.\n\nGiven the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website, and training data labeled by human judges and/or via AI systems with human oversight. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing’s ranking goals and engages in ongoing monitoring and oversight of its ranking systems and adjusts its practices as needed to make sure search results remain aligned with Bing’s principles.\n\nMain parameters of ranking\n\nBelow is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing’s complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results. The relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve over time.\n\nRelevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches a user’s intent behind a search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents, but Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to research low-quality content.\n\nQuality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page’s “authority”, which includes factors such as:\n\nReputation: What types of other websites link to the site? A well-known news site is considered to have a higher reputation than a brand-new blog.\n\nLevel of discourse: Is the purpose of the content solely to cause harm to individuals or groups of people? For example, a site that promotes violence or resorts to name-calling or bullying will be considered to have a low level of discourse, and therefore lower authority, than a balanced news article.\n\nLevel of distortion: How well does the site differentiate fact from opinion? A site that is clearly labeled as satire or parody will have more authority than one that tries to obscure its intent.\n\nOrigination and transparency of the ownership: Is the site reporting first-hand information, or does it summarize or republish content from others? If the site doesn’t publish original content, do they attribute the source? A first-hand account published on a personal blog could have more authority than unsourced content.\n\nUser engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? For webmasters, the Bing Webmaster Dashboard provides insights into how users interact with their webpages.\n\nFreshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. A page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly.\n\nLocation and Language: In ranking results, Bing considers the user’s location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page.\n\nPage load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave a website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. In most cases Bing will consider this a poor user experience and a less helpful search result.\n\nUse of personal data\n\nBing uses information specific to an individual user to improve relevance and performance. This information includes search history, location, language, device characteristics such as operating system or browser, and whether a user is on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop. Users can update their location, language, and other settings via Bing Settings, and delete search history on the Privacy Dashboard.\n\nPaid content and Microsoft-promoted content\n\nWebsites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising; paid advertisements that appear in search results are labeled as such. Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions (the “blue links”) through payment. Learn more about how paid search ads are ranked within advertising search results.\n\nBing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results. Outside of organic search results, Bing will sometimes provide a standalone answer box or banner promoting a Microsoft product or service when relevant to the search term provided.\n\nNature of businesses\n\nThe characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to “Strict” mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, would be considered low authority content.\n\nCertain countries have laws or regulations that apply to search service providers and require search engines to remove links to certain indexed pages from search results. Some of these laws allow specific individuals or entities to demand removal of results (such as for copyright infringement, libel, defamation, personally identifiable information, hate speech, or other personal rights), while others are administered and enforced by local governments.\n\nWhen Microsoft receives a request or demand, Bing aims to balance its support for freedom of expression and for free access to relevant content with compliance with local laws. We review and assess the request or demand, including the reason and basis for the request or demand, the authority or rights of the requesting party, our applicable policies and our commitments to our users with regard to freedom of expression, human rights, and freedom of information and determine whether and to what extent we should remove access to the content. Examples of legal request areas with global approaches are below.\n\nChild sexual exploitation and assault imagery and related materials\n\nThe production and distribution of, and access to, child sexual abuse materials is universally condemned and illegal in most jurisdictions. It is also a violation of Bing and Microsoft policies. Bing works with third party technology and industry groups, law enforcement, and governmental and non-governmental organizations to help stop the spread of this horrific content online. One way we do this is by removing pages that have been reviewed by credible agencies (or identified via Microsoft PhotoDNA content detection tools) and found to contain or relate to the sexual exploitation or abuse of children.\n\nIn particular, we remove pages from our index that have been identified by the Internet Watch Foundation (UK), NCMEC (US), and FSM (Germany) as, in their good faith judgment, hosting or providers of access to child sexual abuse material. Removing these links from displayed search results doesn’t block the materials from being accessed on the web or discovered through means other than Bing, but it does reduce the availability of these pages for those who would seek it out or profit from it.\n\nBing also uses PhotoDNA hash-matching technology to scan images uploaded by users in the visual search feature for potential exploitations and abuse imagery. User activity in Bing is governed by the Microsoft Services Agreement. More information about Microsoft and Bing’s use of PhotoDNA and content moderation practices are available at Digital Safety Moderation and Enforcement.\n\nCopyright infringement\n\nBing encourages respect for intellectual property rights, including copyrights, while also recognizing the rights of users to engage in uses that may be permissible under applicable copyright laws. Bing may remove from its search results links to webpages containing material infringing the rights of the owner of copyrighted content, provided we receive a legally sufficient notice of copyright infringement from the copyright owner or its authorized agent.\n\nIf you are a rights holder and have an intellectual property concern about a website’s content that is linked to by Bing, or a Bing ad, please see our Report Infringement page.\n\nIn certain circumstances relating to quality, safety, and user value, Bing may decide to remove certain results, or we may warn or educate users or provide options for tailoring results.\n\nSpam\n\nCertain pages captured in the Bing index may turn out to be pages of little or no value to users and/or can have characteristics that artificially manipulate the way search and advertising systems work in order to distort their relevance relative to pages that offer more relevant information. Some of these pages include only advertisements and/or links to other websites that contain mostly ads, and no, or only superficial, content relevant to the subject of the search. To improve the search experience for users and deliver more relevant content, Bing might remove such search results, or adjust Bing algorithms to prioritize more useful and relevant pages in search results.\n\nSensitive personal information, including nonconsensual distribution of intimate images\n\nFrom time to time, webpages that are publicly available may intentionally or inadvertently contain sensitive personal information posted without the consent of the individual identified or in circumstances that create security or privacy risks. Examples include inadvertent posting of private records, private phone numbers, identification numbers and the like, or intentionally and maliciously posting email passwords, login credentials, credit card numbers, or other data intended to be used for fraud or hacking. Upon verification, Bing will remove such search results.\n\nAnother example is when someone shares adult or sexually explicit images of another person online – whether real or a “deepfake” image that is created using AI or other photo editing tools - without that person’s consent. This is commonly referred to as nonconsensual intimate imagery, or \"revenge porn\". Microsoft considers this to be a gross invasion of personal privacy. To help victims get back control of their images and their privacy, Bing may remove links to such photos and videos from search results. To report unauthorized online photos and videos, including deepfakes, victims should complete a form on our reporting web page.\n\nAs noted in the reporting form, it’s important to remember that information will remain available on the original website even if Bing has removed the link from search results. The website owner is in the best position to address privacy concerns about the information it publishes. Victims will need to contact owners of the website where the content is hosted to remove content from the web.\n\nAdult content\n\nBing offers a SafeSearch feature, which allows most users to set the type of filtering for adult content that they prefer to apply to their search results. Bing endeavors to avoid delivering content that can be offensive or harmful when it wasn’t requested and provides SafeSearch settings to allow users to customize their search experience. By default, in most countries or regions, SafeSearch is set to Moderate, which restricts visually explicit search results but doesn't restrict explicit text. Users can choose to change their SafeSearch settings at any time.\n\nDifferent countries or regions may have different local customs, religious or cultural norms, or local laws regarding the display of adult content (or search results accessing adult content). This may affect default SafeSearch settings for Bing in some countries.\n\nIllegal pharmaceuticals\n\nIn furtherance of Bing’s commitment to provide users with trustworthy search results, Bing has taken steps to minimize the likelihood that users are harmed through illegal pharmaceutical sales online. In the US, Bing blocks online pharmacies listed on the FDA's Internet Pharmacy Warning Letters site. The FDA, as the federal regulatory body for the pharmaceutical industry in the United States, maintains this public list of online pharmacies engaged in illegal and unsafe practices. The FDA has more information at BeSafeRx: Know Your Online Pharmacy.\n\nPublic service announcements and warnings\n\nFor some topics, it can be difficult to find quality information. When we identify these gaps, we sometimes insert helpful content so users can explore a topic faster. These can take many different forms. You might see a ‘public service’ answer, an answer that explains breaking news, or a warning on a particular site known to contain potentially harmful information. To ensure we are getting the details right, we always look for authoritative sources for curated and original content. If we are using a third-party source, we’ll always show their name or website so you’ll know where the data is coming from.\n\nFor example, Bing provides links to suicide prevention resources when a user’s query expresses a possible suicide intent. Microsoft Bing also provides warning notices on certain URLs appearing in search results where it has reliable information that the link contains possibly harmful content. Such notices appear on links to sites Microsoft Bing has determined to contain harmful malware that could damage a user’s computer. Microsoft Bing also provides a warning to users in the United States on any link identified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy® (NABP®) as a “Not Recommended Site.”\n\nModeration in Copilot in Bing\n\nCopilot in Bing builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new search interface and conversational experience. Copilot in Bing also include features such as Image Creator from Designer, Copilot Pro and Copilot GPTs and GPT Builder (coming soon). Content that appears in conversational search and similar features is subject to the same moderation principles as other content appearing in search results; where applicable, Bing may remove content in Copilot in Bing that is in violation of applicable laws or Microsoft policies, including the Copilot in Bing terms and Code of Conduct.\n\nWe are constantly working to improve our search results. In some cases we may limit how we display content in conversational search or Image Creator in order to prevent users from being unexpectedly exposed to misleading or harmful information. Users can always view a full set of search results relevant to their query on the main Bing search results page.\n\nAll inputs or data provided by users to power Copilot in Bing, as well as use of generated outputs, are subject to the Terms of Use. In certain cases, Copilot Bing may restrict access to the service to users who seriously or repeatedly violate the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct. Users can report problematic content appearing in Copilot in Bing by sending feedback using the “feedback” button which is always available at the bottom of Copilot pages, or using the Report a Concern form, which is linked from the Feedback interface and in Bing Help.\n\nProviding helpful search suggestions\n\nBing takes steps to ensure that users are not inadvertently led to potentially harmful, offensive, or misleading content via search suggestions. We set guardrails to prevent users from unexpectedly being exposed to potentially harmful or offensive content by using a combination of proactive and reactive algorithmic and manual interventions. These interventions only apply to search suggestions; users are never prevented from manually entering a search query.\n\nYou may turn on and off autosuggest feature in the Bing Setting page (Search - Settings (bing.com))by selecting or unselecting the “See search suggestions as you type” checkbox."
