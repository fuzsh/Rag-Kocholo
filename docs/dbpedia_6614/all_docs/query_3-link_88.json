Further, the Commission has established an exemption order respecting classes of online undertakings in relation to the Registration Regulations.\n\nAs a result of the new Registration Regulations and the new exemption order, various online undertakings that broadcast audio or audio-visual content that is intended to inform, enlighten or entertain must be registered with the Commission and provide it with basic information by no later than 28 November 2023. Such services include streaming services, social media services, subscription television services that are available online, radio stations that live-stream over the Internet, services that offer podcasts (free or paid subscription), and services that offer unique transactions allowing the user to stream or download content.\n\nExempted from the new regulations are online undertakings that either alone, or as part of a broadcasting ownership group, have less than $10 million in annual broadcasting revenues in Canada, and those whose single activity and purpose consists of providing either video game services or audiobook services. For the sake of clarity, users that upload content on social media platforms are not subject to the Broadcasting Act and therefore will not need to register.\n\nThe Registration Regulations will be published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, and will come into force on 29 September 2023. A copy of the Registration Regulations is set out in Appendix 1 to this regulatory policy. The exemption order is set out in Appendix 2.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Commission announces that it has made, with some changes, the Online Undertakings Registration Regulations (the Registration Regulations) as proposed in Appendix 1 to Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2023-139 (the Notice). Further, it has established the criteria for exemption from those regulations, based on the Proposed exemption order respecting classes of online undertakings in relation to the proposed Online Undertakings Registration Regulations, set out in Appendix 2 to the Notice.\n\nThe Registration Regulations will come into force on 29 September 2023 and subsequently be published in the Canada Gazette, Part II. A copy of the Registration Regulations is set out in Appendix 1 to this regulatory policy. The exemption order is set out in Appendix 2.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 27 April 2023, the Online Streaming Act came into force.Footnote 1 This Act includes, among other things, amendments to the Broadcasting Act to account for the impact that Internet audio and videoFootnote 2 services have had on the Canadian broadcasting system. The amended Broadcasting Act provides the Commission with clear powers and tools to, among other things, regulate certain online undertakings operating in whole or in part in Canada, regardless of their country of origin, when they are operating as “broadcasting undertakings”.Footnote 3 As set out in the Broadcasting Act, “online undertaking” means “an undertaking for the transmission or retransmission of programs over the Internet for reception by the public by means of broadcasting receiving apparatus.”\n\nParagraph 10(1)(i) of the Broadcasting Act grants the Commission the power to make regulations respecting the registration of broadcasting undertakings with the Commission. Pursuant to subsection 2(1) of the Broadcasting Act, the definition of “broadcasting undertaking” now includes online undertakings.Footnote 4\n\nThe Commission currently has limited information on online undertakings operating in Canada. Certain information has recently been collected following the implementation of the Annual Digital Media Survey (the Digital Media Survey), the launch of which was approved in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy 2022-47.\n\nConsidering the clear mandate of the amended Broadcasting Act to regulate online broadcasting undertakings, the Commission must obtain information about a broader scope of online broadcasting services operating in Canada to ensure that it can fulfil this mandate. The first step enabling the collection of such information is to require online undertakings to register with the Commission. In this regard, on 12 May 2023, the Commission published the Notice, in which it called for comments on the proposed Registration Regulations, which would require the registration of certain online undertakings, and on a proposed order exempting certain classes of online undertakings from the requirement of being registered.\n\nGiven the above, the proposed Registration Regulations aim to:\n\n(i) create an up-to-date registry of certain online undertakings; and\n\n(ii) gather basic information that is essential to fostering a regulatory relationship with online undertakings operating in Canada.\n\nThe Registration Regulations are meant to provide the Commission with de minimis information about online undertakings and their activities in Canada, which would give the Commission an initial understanding of the Canadian online broadcasting landscape and would allow it to communicate with online undertakings. The information collected would allow the Commission to assess whether other obligations are needed and to seek further information, where necessary.\n\nOn 10 June 2023, the Government of Canada published for comment in the Canada Gazette Order Issuing Directions to the CRTC (Sustainable and Equitable Broadcasting Regulatory Framework) , a proposed policy direction (the proposed Direction) that, once finalized, would guide the Commission in its implementation of the amended Broadcasting Act. The Commission notes that the proposed Direction has not yet been finalized.\n\nIn the sections that follow, the Commission addresses issues relating to the following:\n\nthe registration requirements of the Registration Regulations;\n\nexemptions regarding the requirement to register with the Commission;\n\nthe revenue calculation method to be used in determining whether to exempt an online service from the requirement to register;\n\ndeadlines set out in the proposed Registration Regulations; and\n\nconsiderations relating to the deregistration process.\n\nThe Commission wishes to thank all those who participated in this proceeding. The thoughtfulness and clarity reflected in the written submissions greatly assisted the Commission in its deliberations.\n\nThe registration requirements\n\nThe requirements of the Registration Regulations will apply to all operators of online undertakings subject to the Broadcasting Act, except those that have been exempted from such Regulations. The exemption order identifies the classes of online undertakings to which these requirements do not apply. As such, the two instruments should be read in conjunction.\n\nThe following sections address comments that were received from interveners. For the purpose of its determinations set out below, the Commission has, in general, focused on the comments that were opposed to or proposed changes to the Commission’s proposals in the Notice.\n\nDefinition of the terms “operator” and “online undertaking”\n\nPursuant to the proposed Registration Regulations, “operator” means a person that carries on an online undertaking to which the Broadcasting Act applies. In its intervention, the Forum for Research and Policy in Communications (FRPC) noted that different definitions of “operator” exist, as the Broadcasting Distribution Regulations use a definition different from that set out in the proposed Registration Regulations. It recommended using unique terms consistently to avoid costly misunderstanding.\n\nThe Commission is of the view that the definition of “operator” in the Registration Regulations is sufficiently clear in that context. However, it notes that there is no definition of “operator” in the proposed exemption order. To be clear, the Commission considers that it would be appropriate to define “operator” in the exemption order as a person that carries on a broadcasting undertaking to which the Broadcasting Act applies.\n\nIn its intervention, Bragg Communications Inc., carrying on business as Eastlink (Eastlink), requested that the Commission confirm that online platforms of broadcasting distribution undertakings (BDU) that solely provide the BDU’s subscribers with an alternate means of viewing the programming to which they subscribe via the BDU do not qualify as online undertakings. The Commission considers, however, that this type of online platform does constitute an online undertaking, as defined in the Broadcasting Act. Accordingly, those online undertakings would be required to register with the Commission, provided they do not fall under one of the exempt classes of undertakings (e.g., under the revenue threshold set out in the exemption order).\n\nInformation to be provided by operators of online undertakings\n\nThe proposed Registration Regulations set out certain information to be provided by operators of online undertakings. More specifically, an operator would be required to register its online undertaking by submitting to the Commission a registration return that contains the following information:\n\n(a) the online undertaking’s name;\n\n(b) the operator’s name, mailing address, phone number and email address;\n\n(c) if different than the contact information filed under paragraph (b), contact information for a contact person for the operator, such as their name, title, mailing address, phone number and email address;\n\n(d) the place where the online undertaking is incorporated or otherwise formed, if any, and the location of its head office; and\n\n(e) the broadcasting services offered by the online undertaking.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nVarious interveners, including the global streaming services Apple Canada Inc. (Apple), Netflix Services Canada ULC (Netflix), Spotify, Roku, Inc. (Roku), TikTok Canada (TikTok) and Google LLC (Google), as well as the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) and the Motion Picture Association of Canada (MPAC), agreed with the proposed registration requirements, and considered them to be light.\n\nSome interveners argued that the proposed information requested was too extensive. As an example, Meta Platforms Inc. (Meta) stated that the Commission should limit the information gathered to the name of the service and the contact information.\n\nThe CAB, who favoured light registration requirements, nevertheless proposed that the basic information should be expanded to include a full description of the service offered, including whether it is an audio or video service, and the language in which the service operates. This was a common proposal among interveners.\n\nSeveral interveners proposed that the Commission require additional information from undertakings given that the information to be requested under the proposal would not allow the Commission to anticipate new trends, properly monitor the sector, or better understand the Canadian online broadcasting landscape. Such additional information included the programming offered (amount of Canadian programming, genre of programs such as programs of national interest [PNI], the use of Canadian resources, information about the service’s accessibility features such as closed captioning), financial information (subscription numbers, financial performance, annual revenues, revenues allocated by linguistic market), the operating model for the service, the date the service began operations in Canada, and the corporate structure and beneficial ownership.\n\nVarious interveners, including Apple, Google, Meta and Spotify, raised the issue of confidentiality of information and recommended that the Commission’s approach in this regard be strengthened so that any commercially sensitive information filed is maintained in strict confidence. Meta noted that if online undertakings exempted from the Registration Regulations must still be registered in some capacity, the Commission should limit the information gathered to the name of the service and the contact information. The CAB noted that information relating to revenues, audiences, and subscription levels is already collected under other mechanisms that are treated confidentially via the Digital Media Survey.\n\nFinally, AMC Networks Inc. (AMC) proposed that paragraph 2(d)Footnote 5 of the proposed Registration Regulations be amended to refer to the “place where the operator is incorporated,” rather than the place where the online undertaking is incorporated. Rogers Communications Inc. (Rogers) supported this proposal and explained that an undertaking is not necessarily a corporate entity.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nThe Commission’s objectives in regard to collecting the information specified in section 2 of the Registration Regulations include being able to contact those undertakings that have registered, keeping track of online undertakings operating in Canada, and gathering basic but essential information to better understand the Canadian online broadcasting landscape more generally.\n\nThe Commission must ensure that it has the information required to better understand the nature and scope of the online undertakings that are part of the Canadian broadcasting system, while being sensitive to the administrative burden imposed on broadcasting undertakingsas well as to the competitive sensitivity of certain information.\n\nTo fulfil these somewhat competing objectives, the Commission is only requiring online undertakings to provide basic information about the operator and its online undertakings, such as the name and contact information of the operator, and information identifying the online undertaking and the types of broadcasting services it offers. In the Commission’s view, providing this information would not be burdensome on the operator of the online undertaking, and would be the most minimal information that would allow the Commission to meet its policy objectives.\n\nIn addition, obtaining information about the language of content provided by online undertakings would provide valuable data to the Commission as it endeavors to achieve the policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act relating to the language of programming.Footnote 6 As such, the Commission considers that information about the broadcasting services offered by the online undertakings should include information about the language(s) of the services. However, to minimize the burden on operators, the Commission will request only general information, such as the predominant language(s) of content and whether the service offers programming in English, French and/or Indigenous languages.\n\nThe online undertaking registration form will also ask operators to identify the broadcasting ownership groupFootnote 7 of which they form part, if applicable. Although, in the Commission’s view, this information is helpful for its internal processes and for the administration of the Broadcasting Act, this will be an optional field for the operator to complete.\n\nAs noted, the Commission is mindful of the importance of minimizing the burden of the registration process as much as possible, without undermining the Commission’s objectives. Accordingly, the Commission is implementing a registration process that will require operators of online undertakings to register once, and only file updates if the information changes. In addition, the Commission has made available on its website an online undertaking registration form, and requests that operators who operate more than one online undertaking submit only one registration form, with the option of including an appendix for each online undertaking carried on by the operator. This will avoid the filing of information about the same operator multiple times. Further, it will be possible for operators who have already submitted a registration form for the Digital Media Survey to file an Attestation Form, which will allow those operators to confirm that the information that has been filed as part of the Digital Media Survey remains accurate, and to provide only information that has not been provided as part of the Digital Media Survey, or information that is more accurate.\n\nFurther, in regard to AMC’s proposed amendment to paragraph 2(d) of the proposed Registration Regulations, the Commission finds that making this amendment would be in line with the Commission’s practice to require information about the place of incorporation of the person that operates the undertaking.\n\nFinally, the Commission considers that the confidentiality concerns raised by interveners are likely unfounded given the basic nature of the information to be provided.\n\nIn light of the above, operators of online undertakings will be required to comply with the Registration Regulations, unless they fall within one of the classes of exempted online undertakings. In addition, the Commission has amended subsection 2(d) of the proposed Registration Regulations in order to request information on the “place of incorporation of the operator,” rather than on the “place of incorporation of the undertaking.”\n\nPublication of registration information\n\nIn the Notice, the Commission set out its intention to publish on its website a list of registered online undertakings operating in Canada. Interveners were invited to comment on whether such a list should indeed be made public.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nOverall, interveners considered that a list of registrants should be made public as doing so would be in the public interest and favour transparency. The Association quÃ©bÃ©coise de la production mÃ©diatique (AQPM) proposed that the Commission create a mechanism to ensure that the information available to the public is kept up to date.\n\nThe main concern over making registrants public related to the confidentiality of some information in the event that the Commission broadens the scope of the information requested as part of the registration process. In addition, Vaxination Informatique opposed the publication of registrants as it would be an attack on privacy for someone who, for example, built a website under a pseudonym.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nIn the Commission’s view, publishing the list of registrants and some of the information they provide would be in line with its commitment to transparency and dedication to serving the public interest of Canadians.\n\nThe public registry would only show the most basic information concerning online undertakings, such as the operator’s name, the online undertaking’s name, the type of broadcasting service provided (whether it is an audio or video service) and the operator’s mailing address.\n\nIn regard to updating the information available to the public, pursuant to section 4 of the Registration Regulations, an operator must notify the Commission of any change to information previously submitted by submitting the updated information withinFootnote 8 30 days after the day on which the change occurs. This would enable the Commission to update the information available to the public as those changes become known.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission will publish on its website and make available to the public the list of registrants and the above-noted basic information.\n\nExemptions from the requirement to register with the Commission\n\nPursuant to subsection 9(4) of the Broadcasting Act, the Commission shall, by order, on the terms and conditions that it considers appropriate, exempt persons who carry on broadcasting undertakings of any class specified in the order from any or all of the requirements of a regulation if the Commission is satisfied that compliance with those requirements will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1).\n\nIn its 1996 policy regarding the use of exemption orders,Footnote 9 the Commission stated that “it is not the size or importance of the class of undertaking to be exempted that is the test; the test is whether it is necessary for the class to comply with Part II of the Act or relevant regulations in order to further the implementation of the policy set out in the Act.”\n\nAs noted above, the Registration Regulations impose on online undertakings the most basic of regulatory requirements. They are meant to provide the Commission with de minimis information about online undertakings and their activities in Canada. In contrast, the Commission will have no information from, and would have no readily ascertainable way of communicating with, online undertakings that are exempted from the Registration Regulations. While exempted online undertakings will continue to be subject to the Broadcasting Act, the Commission will not be able to effectively monitor the development of those undertakings and will not be able to assess whether they should be subject to any form of regulation.\n\nGiven the importance of online undertakings in the new regulatory regime, and given that the Commission is in the very initial stages of implementing the numerous new policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act, and in light of the minimal regulatory requirements at issue here, the Commission finds that it should err on the side of a registration requirement and only exempt online undertakings if it is satisfied that compliance with the Registration Regulations will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the Canadian broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act.\n\nAs set out in the Notice, the Commission proposed to exempt from the requirement to register:\n\n(i) online undertakings whose single activity and purpose consists of providing video game services;\n\n(ii) online undertakings whose single activity and purpose consists of providing unique transactions;\n\n(iii) online undertakings affiliated with a broadcasting ownership group that has, after deducting any excluded revenue, annual Canadian gross revenues from broadcasting activities of less than $10 million; or\n\n(iv) online undertakings that have no affiliation whatsoever with a broadcasting ownership group, if they have, after deducting any excluded revenue, annual Canadian gross revenues from broadcasting activities of less than $10 million.\n\nIn the sections that follow, the Commission addresses issues relating to a threshold for exemption, as well as the various classes of online undertakings proposed for exemption by the Commission in the Notice and by interveners in their submissions to this proceeding.\n\nMonetary threshold for exemption\n\nBased on its review of the record for this proceeding, the Commission has identified the following issues to be examined in regard to the threshold for exemption:\n\nwhether a monetary threshold is the appropriate criterion to determine whether the registration of certain online undertakings would contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act;\n\nwhether it would be appropriate to apply the threshold level on broadcasting ownership groups as a whole, or on individual online undertakings, and to include revenues of traditional broadcasting undertakings; and\n\nwhether the exemption threshold of $10 million in annual Canadian gross revenues from broadcasting activities, as proposed in the Notice, is appropriate.\n\nThe use of a monetary threshold\n\nThe Commission often relies in part on thresholds to trigger requirements or exemptions. For example, it uses revenue levels to determine whether a radio station must make Canadian content development (CCD) contributions and subscriber numbers as the basis for exempting certain discretionary programming services and BDUs. In the Notice, the Commission proposed a monetary threshold based on revenues as one of the bases to exempt online undertakings.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nSeveral intervenersFootnote 10 considered a revenue threshold to be appropriate.\n\nHowever, TELUS Communications Inc. (TELUS), and the Association des rÃ©alisateurs et rÃ©alisatrices du QuÃ©bec (ARRQ), the Guilde des musiciennes et musiciens du QuÃ©bec (GMMQ), the SociÃ©tÃ© des auteurs de radio, tÃ©lÃ©vision et cinÃ©ma (SARTEC) and the Union des artists (UDA) (joint intervention, collectively ARRQ-GMMQ-SARTEC-UDA), proposed using a subscriber-based threshold rather than a revenue-based threshold. TELUS considered that such an approach would be administratively simpler, and that a threshold based on the number of subscribers would be “a better indicator of relative size than annual revenues, which can be impacted by factors such as different profit margins.”\n\nCorus Entertainment Inc. (Corus) opposed using only a subscriber-based threshold given that the online broadcasting ecosystem includes platforms with different service delivery and monetization models, such as advertising supported platforms with no subscription component. It argued that using a subscriber-based threshold alone would effectively exempt advertising-driven platforms from the scope of the proposed Registration Regulations.\n\nThe AQPM, the Independent Broadcast Group (IBG), St. Andrews Community Channel Inc. (St. Andrews), ACCORD,Footnote 11 the SociÃ©tÃ© de tÃ©lÃ©diffusion du QuÃ©bec (TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec), the Association quÃ©bÃ©coise de l’industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidÃ©o (ADISQ) and Wildbrain Ltd., among others, submitted that the number of subscribers as an indicator could be used as one factor among others, and thereby capture a larger number of online undertakings. They noted other potential indicators such as the proposed revenue model, degree of influence, how content is funded and made available, market share, number of users, number of clicks and/or views, and number of monthly users or listening hours. TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec proposed registering online undertakings that reach 5% of Canadian Internet users, in addition to other indicators such as the number of unique customers for subscription services and the number of visits for ad-financed services. An individual intervener proposed using a percentage metric, to be calculated from the net annual revenue.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nThe Commission considers that a revenue-based threshold is a relatively simple and objective criterion that can be applied by all online undertakings, regardless of their business models.Footnote 12\n\nWhile some interveners preferred a subscriber-based threshold, the Commission finds that it would not be appropriate to adopt a subscriber-based indicator alone given that doing so would not provide an accurate understanding of the online broadcasting system. As noted by other interveners, it would not capture those online undertakings that have no subscribers, such as advertising-based online undertakings.\n\nIn regard to using multiple criteria, the Commission notes that there is generally a strong relationship between the number of subscribers and the level of revenues of an undertaking. Adding a subscriber threshold would therefore be largely redundant and burdensome. Further, using numerous indicators would make registration much more complex, thereby making it more difficult for the Commission to track information and communicate the requirements for registration. Finally, none of the interveners provided compelling evidence that using other indicators would be a significant improvement to the proposed approach based on an annual revenue threshold.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that a monetary threshold based on annual Canadian gross revenues would be the clearest and most comprehensive way to determine which online undertakings are to be exempted from the requirement to register with the Commission.\n\nMonetary threshold based on the revenues of broadcasting ownership groups versus revenues of individual online undertakings, and inclusion of revenues of traditional broadcasting undertakings\n\nFor those online undertakings whose operator forms part of a broadcasting ownership group,Footnote 13 the Commission proposed a monetary threshold based on the revenues of the broadcasting ownership group, rather than on the revenues of each individual undertaking operating within that group. Such revenues would be included irrespective of whether they are generated by traditional broadcasting undertakings or by online undertakings operating within that group.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nParties that supported the proposal\n\nEastlink, along with public interest groups and associations representing a variety of members of the broadcasting industry,Footnote 14 agreed with the proposal set out in the Notice.\n\nThe Writers Guild of Canada (WGC) raised the issue of fairness. Specifically, it noted that unlike non-affiliated undertakings, online undertakings affiliated with a broadcasting ownership group can benefit from synergies within the group, as those undertakings can cross-promote services and content and consolidate resources that can be made available to multiple undertakings within that group. For the WGC, using a group-based approach would make it more likely that “smaller players” that are exempt are truly smaller, as they lack such synergies and access to resources. The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) added that online undertakings affiliated with Canadian broadcasting ownership groups are rarely standalone services but instead the extension of an existing regulated service within the broadcasting group.\n\nThe CMPA noted that the group-based approach used by Canadian broadcasters provides those broadcasters with greater flexibility in the allocation of programming resources. It argued that broadcasters would not be able to continue fulfilling their programming commitments as a group should registration be required at the individual undertaking level.\n\nCertain interveners also considered that a group-based approach would limit the impact of creative accounting. ACCORD explained that to do otherwise could incentivize broadcasting ownership groups to use creative accounting methods to split revenues among their undertakings to limit the regulatory requirements imposed on them. The AQPM considered that an individual undertaking approach could provide an incentive to broadcasters to separate their group into numerous services to avoid registering and, eventually, being subject to conditions of service.Footnote 15 The Canadian Association of Community Television Users and Stations (CACTUS) noted that broadcasters could also divide their networks into imaginary geographic divisions to operate as exempt undertakings.\n\nIn regard to the broadcasting undertakings (traditional or online) of which the revenues would be included for the purpose of calculating the exemption threshold, interveners including the AQPM, the Conseil provincial du secteur des communications du Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique (CPSC-SCFP) and TV5 QuÃ©bec Canada (TV5) favoured registering as many online services as possible.Footnote 16 The National Campus and Community Radio Association (NCCRA) added that broadcasters can repurpose content on online platforms and, as such, annual revenues would be better reflected across all services.\n\nTV5 submitted that all online undertakings broadcasting content from traditional services should be required to register, regardless of the amount of revenues collected, on the grounds that those online undertakings materially contribute to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act.\n\nParties that opposed the proposal\n\nTraditional Canadian broadcasters,Footnote 17 broadcasters associationsFootnote 18, the Digital Media Association (DiMA), the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC), the global streaming services AMC, Apple, Google and Tubi, Inc. (Tubi), and an individual intervener opposed the group-based approach for calculating the revenues on which the exemption threshold is based. In their view, using a group‑based approach would require the registration of very small or nascent online undertakings owned by broadcasters that do not make meaningful contributions to the Canadian broadcasting system.\n\nSirius XM Canada Inc. (SiriusXM), as well as Corus and Cogeco Inc. (Cogeco), noted that the Commission has, in the past, regularly exempted BDUs and discretionary services from licensing requirements, notwithstanding that they might operate as part of a larger broadcasting ownership group.\n\nThe CAB and Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) submitted that adopting a group-based approach would do little to provide useful information to the Commission or advance the policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act. An individual intervener submitted that the Commission would be overwhelmed with registrations for every small website or service that a large broadcaster owns.\n\nThe CAB, the Ontario Association of Broadcasters (OAB) and certain Canadian broadcastersFootnote 19 submitted that the group-based approach would be unfair. In their view, under such an approach, the vast majority of online undertakings operated by Canadian broadcasters would be registered, even those that earn very little revenue. The OAB further noted that the approach would impact small radio stations, while AMI added that it would impact licensees of services that benefit from mandatory distribution pursuant to paragraph 9.1(1)(h) of the Broadcasting Act. AMI submitted that, under this proposal, it could be more challenging for the Commission and stakeholders to monitor developments in the digital media sector in the months and years ahead.\n\nQuebecor Media Inc. (Quebecor) noted that using an undertaking-based approach would be in line with section 4 of the proposed Direction, which specifies that requirements on broadcasting undertakings must be equitable, given the size and nature of the undertaking, and equitable between foreign online undertakings and Canadian broadcasting undertakings. For its part, the OAB considered that the adoption of a group-based approach would subject medium-sized independent players to the same rules imposed on large streaming-only companies.\n\nCorus considered that using a group-based approach would risk entrenching regulatory inequities between foreign and domestic players. It argued that although the definition of “broadcasting ownership group” is not restricted to Canadian media groups, those Canadian groups would be disproportionately impacted by the adoption of a group-based approach. Corus added that whereas established Canadian media groups owning some combination of licensed broadcasting assets would almost certainly come within the scope of the definition, new or recent foreign digital entrants to the Canadian market likely would not.\n\nCertain interveners submitted that a group-based approach would increase the regulatory burden on broadcasting ownership groups. According to the OAB, a group-based approach would impose an undue burden on conventional broadcasters. Rogers noted that the registration requirement would apply to each of its online undertakings, including those earning little to no annual revenues (e.g., an individual website that simulcasts a radio signal online), simply because they are affiliated with a broadcasting ownership group. It considered that an individual online undertaking will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of Canada’s broadcasting policy if its annual Canadian gross revenues from broadcasting activities are less than $10 million, regardless of whether it is operating independently or as part of a larger ownership group. Google noted that the proposed Direction expressly states that, to “support flexibility and adaptability in its regulatory framework, the Commission is directed to minimize the regulatory burden on the Canadian broadcasting system.”\n\nInterveners also considered that such an approach would be unfair for Canadian broadcasting ownership groups given that they would be required to include revenues from their traditional services, while foreign ownership groups would only be required to include revenues from online broadcasting. Interveners including BCE Inc. (BCE), the CAB, Corus, Pelmorex Weather Networks (Television) Inc. (Pelmorex) and Rogers submitted that the proposed approach would include a broadcaster with $15 million in annual revenues from traditional services even if it earns almost no online revenues, while allowing an independent foreign player not to register even if it earns annual revenues of $9.9 million.\n\nAccording to Corus, this would provide a head start to foreign online platforms, contrary to Parliament’s objective of a level playing field. It submitted that placing more onerous conditions on Canadian broadcasters would run counter to the intended purpose of establishing a modernized regulatory framework that creates equity between broadcasters and foreign streamers.\n\nCorus further submitted that interveners overstated the importance of synergies for Canadian broadcasting groups given that foreign players have much higher synergies than Canadian broadcasters with their non-broadcasting assets, such as technology devices (Apple), destination travel (Disney) and e-commerce (Amazon). It added that a group-based approach would discourage broadcasting ownership groups from innovating and investing in new products. Corus further added that registering online undertakings as soon as they collect revenues would not account for the experimental nature of digital distribution, which would not serve the objectives of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nCogeco noted that the Broadcasting Act imposes requirements on undertakings individually, not on ownership groups. It added that the Broadcasting Act makes no mention of broadcasting ownership groups.\n\nFinally, within the context of the definition of broadcasting ownership group, Tubi stated that it was not familiar with the Commission’s concept of control and how that concept is defined.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nParagraphs 5(2)(g) and (h) of the Broadcasting Act state that the Canadian broadcasting system should be regulated and supervised in a flexible manner that is sensitive to the administrative burden that may be imposed on undertakings, and that takes into account the variety of undertakings to which that Act applies and avoids imposing obligations on undertakings if it will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1).\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that adopting its proposed approach means that online undertakings affiliated with traditional Canadian broadcasters are less likely to be exempted from registration. Indeed, if the threshold is calculated based on the revenues of the broadcasting ownership group, then individual registration of all online undertakings that operate within those groups will be required.\n\nHowever, the Commission agrees with interveners that argued that broadcasting groups benefit from important synergies associated with operating both traditional and online undertakings. The Commission considers that the benefits associated with group ownership cannot be disassociated with the regulatory obligations that come with such ownership. While the Commission is sensitive to the administrative burden associated with registration, it considers this burden to be rather light, particularly for those larger, group-based undertakings that already have a longstanding regulatory relationship with the Commission.\n\nIn addition, basing the threshold on the revenues of individual undertakings could prevent the Commission from having information about the variety of undertakings operated by large broadcasting ownership groups. The group-based approach would allow the Commission to better understand the full ecosystem of broadcasting services provided by large broadcasting groups who play a significant role in the Canadian broadcasting system, both national and international.\n\nOn the matter of the Commission’s proposal to include the revenues of traditional broadcasting undertakings in the calculation of the threshold, it notes that several traditional undertakings are moving certain operations online. It is important for the Commission to understand this transition as it is taking place, rather than wait until the online services of traditional broadcasters reach the threshold. Including revenues from traditional and online services for the purposes of calculating the threshold would give the Commission better insight on how ownership groups are adapting their activities in an increasingly digital environment, allowing the Commission to better understand and monitor the broadcasting system as a whole.\n\nIn addition, a threshold based on the revenues of broadcasting ownership groups that include the revenues from traditional services would reduce the incentive to use accounting practices through which the revenues of broadcasting ownership groups would be allocated between several undertakings, or between licensed and online services, in a manner that would result in individual online undertakings falling under the revenue threshold.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges that this approach provides an asymmetrical treatment between those undertakings that operate within a group and those that do not. It is also mindful of the regulatory burden imposed on those Canadian online undertakings that, although their operator forms part of a Canadian broadcasting ownership group, have modest or no revenues. However, the burden imposed by the registration process is very light, given that the information required would be limited and that registration is meant to be a one-time requirement for online undertakings.Footnote 20 In the Commission’s view, such a minimal burden is justifiable, and the benefits of registering undertakings in this manner outweigh the limited impact on certain online undertakings whose operator forms part of a Canadian broadcasting ownership group.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that for the purposes of determining exemption from the requirement to register, it would be appropriate to implement an exemption threshold based on the revenues of the broadcasting ownership group and to include the revenues of traditional services, as proposed in the Notice. Specifically, including revenues from both traditional and online services would allow the Commission to gain a better understanding of the Canadian online broadcasting environment and how ownership groups are adapting their activities in that increasingly digital environment.\n\nIn regard to Tubi’s comment on the concept of control, the Commission finds that the current definition of broadcasting ownership group in the proposed exemption order can be improved. Accordingly, in the exemption order, the Commission has amended the definition of broadcasting ownership group so that it reads as follows (change in bold): “a group of all operators that are affiliates of one another”, and has added the following definition of “operator”: “a person that carries on a broadcasting undertaking to which the Broadcasting Act applies.”\n\nGiven that the Broadcasting Act defines “affiliate,”Footnote 21 “control”Footnote 22 Â (which is used in the definition of “affiliate”) and “broadcasting undertaking,”Footnote 23 the Commission finds that these amendments will provide more clarity to both Canadian and foreign operators.\n\nThe appropriate amount for the exemption threshold\n\nIn the Notice, the Commission proposed to exempt from the requirement to register with the Commission those broadcasting ownership groups, either Canadian or foreign, that have, after deducting any excluded revenue, annual Canadian gross broadcasting revenues from broadcasting activities of less than $10 million.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nRogers, Unifor, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) and the Canada Media Fund (CMF) considered the threshold to be appropriate.\n\nCertain interveners, including Canadian broadcasters,Footnote 24 global corporationsFootnote 25 and industry associations,Footnote 26 submitted that the exemption threshold should be set at a level higher than $10 million in annual Canadian gross broadcasting revenues, as the proposed threshold would include online undertakings that do not contribute in a material manner to the objectives of the Broadcasting Act. They noted that this could deter new players from entering the market and disadvantage smaller Canadian broadcasters. However, the specific threshold proposed by each intervener often varied.Footnote 27\n\nAccording to the CAB, a $20 million threshold would be appropriate given that Netflix, Disney+ and Spotify all have revenues that are much higher than this amount. In its view, it is likely that setting a $10 million threshold would result in numerous services that do not make a material contribution to the system being required to register. BCE supported a $20 million threshold and added that such a threshold would ensure the relevance and the efficiency of the registration regime.\n\nAn individual intervener, supported by Apple, considered that to preserve Canada’s media industry, creators’ livelihoods and Canadians’ access to choice, the Commission should err on the side of caution and adopt the higher thresholds set out in the Digital Media Survey (specifically, $50 million for audio-visual digital media broadcasting undertakings [DMBU] and $25 million for audio DMBUs). OpenMedia Engagement Network (OpenMedia) supported a $50 million threshold on the grounds that anything lower could inadvertently place a burden on smaller startups and niche foreign services. It noted that many diasporic Canadians rely on niche foreign services to maintain essential cultural connections with the wider world, which might be deterred from entering Canada by the requirement to register. According to Roku, a threshold of less than $50 million would impose burdens on still-nascent services that are not yet in a position to have a material effect on the Canadian broadcasting ecosystem and the policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act. An individual intervener argued that setting a threshold below $50 million may also overwhelm the Commission with a high number of registrations.\n\nAccording to TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec, if only online revenues are accounted for, a threshold of $100 million should allow the Commission to attain the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, without dissuading new players or small services with limited services. It added, however, that if both traditional and online revenues are included, a $500 million threshold would be appropriate. Tubi also proposed a $100 million threshold given that before online services reach this threshold, they might be unable to compete against the larger, dominant streaming services, thereby reducing the ability for Canadian viewers to select lower-cost alternatives.\n\nSeveral interveners,Footnote 28 primarily members of the industry associations and public interest organisations, considered the $10 million threshold to be too high, and proposed either lower thresholds or no threshold at all. In their view, if the Commission’s rationale for creating a public registry of online broadcasting undertakings is to “keep track of online undertakings operating in Canada,” the threshold should be set as low as possible in order for the Commission to best attain that objective.\n\nAccording to the CMPA, a higher threshold should not be chosen based on the argument that a lower threshold poses a regulatory burden, since such a burden has not been substantiated by facts. ACCORD added that the Society of Composers, Authors, and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) reviewed its licensing data and noted and that a $10 million exemption threshold would exempt virtually all of the online undertakings for which they license music.\n\nMany interveners, including the Alliance des producteurs francophones du Canada (APFC), the AQPM and the IBG, argued that a $10 million threshold would exclude several online undertakings that contribute in a material manner to the broadcasting system, such as services dedicated to the realities of official language minority communities (OLMC) and Indigenous communities, as well as third‑language services, Indigenous services, community services, and smaller English- or French-language independent broadcasters.\n\nAccording to the WGC, several parties proposing higher thresholds are also the only ones that have the information required for the Commission to issue a ruling on this matter, but have not provided that information on the public record.\n\nIn regard to the proposal to use the same threshold as in the Digital Media Survey, the WGC noted that the threshold was set before the recent amendments to the Broadcasting Act were in effect, and that there are now no reasons for the Commission to tie itself to a previous threshold established in a different context under different legislation.\n\nThe NCCRA proposed a threshold of $2.5 million to maximize the number of services required to support the creation and presentation of Canadian programming. In its view, online broadcasters with gross revenues of more than $2.5 million would contribute materially to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act. It noted that the current CCD contribution framework requires all commercial and ethnic radio broadcasters with more than $1.25 million in annual revenues to make direct financial CCD contributions.\n\nSeveral interveners proposed a threshold of $1 million. FRIENDS of Canadian Broadcasting (FRIENDS) argued that it would be roughly equivalent to the threshold for currently licensed and exempt Canadian broadcasting undertakings. The Directors Guild of Canada (DGC) argued that this threshold would provide the Commission with an effective, transparent, and fulsome registration system that would allow stakeholders and interested parties to properly monitor developments in this important and fast changing digital media sector. >The FÃ©dÃ©ration culturelle canadienne-franÃ§aise (FCCF) supported a $1 million threshold, and noted that this would be similar to that established for the data collection of telecommunication providers.\n\nThe CPSC-SCFP considered that the Commission should register all online broadcasting undertakings, regardless of their revenues.It argued that interveners do not have enough information regarding the level of revenues of foreign undertakings to recommend a specific threshold at this point.\n\nCertain interveners proposed different thresholds depending on the type of undertaking. In this regard, ADISQ, ACCORD and the ARRQ-GMMQ-SARTEC-UDA argued that a $10 million threshold would be too high for the music industry. According to ARRQ-GMMQ-SARTEC-UDA, the fact that the video industry is much more expansive than the audio industry justifies a lower exemption threshold for online audio services. They added that the current exemptions established by the Commission use different thresholds for audio and video services.\n\nInterveners including the APFC, the AQPM, the DGC and the WGC proposed distinct thresholds for English- and French-language markets. In this regard, the APFC noted distinctions between those markets relating to population, revenues and the services that operate in them. The WGC added that paragraphs 3(1)(c)Footnote 29 and 5(2)(a)Footnote 30 of the Broadcasting Act expressly recognize this difference multiple times and direct the Commission to take it into consideration.\n\nFinally, the IBG proposed adding a provision for optional registration by online undertakings that fall below the financial or other threshold, which would enable services that make a material contribution to Canadian broadcasting and wish to be recognized for that contribution within the regulated framework to register. This approach was supported by certain interveners, including Pelmorex, the Documentary Organization of Canada (DOC) and the DGC.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nAs noted above, the Commission’s exemption power is set out in subsection 9(4) of the Broadcasting Act. In addition, the Commission has taken into account the regulatory objectives set out in subsection 5(2), and in particular paragraphs 5(2)(g) and (h).\n\nIn the Commission’s view, setting a low threshold for registration and thereby registering as many online undertakings as possible would provide the most accurate view of online broadcasting undertakings in Canada. However, it would also be administratively impractical. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that many online undertakings have very low revenues or no revenues at all. Registration of such undertakings, to the extent that their operator does not form part of a broadcasting ownership group, would not, in the Commission’s view, contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act.\n\nConversely, setting too high a threshold could result in the collection of information on a small number of very large mainstream services. Having no information on small and medium-sized undertakings, many of which provide diversified or niche programming, would limit the Commission’s capacity to fulfil the objectives of the Canadian broadcasting policy set out, for example, in subparagraph 3(1)(i)(i) of the Broadcasting Act, which states that the programming provided by the Canadian broadcasting system should be varied and comprehensive, providing a balance of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of all ages, interests and tastes. Likewise, it would limit the Commission’s ability to ensure the fulfilment of subparagraph 3(1)(i)(iv), as the Commission would not be able to assess whether the programming offered provides a reasonable opportunity for the public to be exposed to the expression of differing views on matters of public concern and to directly participate in public dialogue on those matters including through the community element.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that it would be better positioned to implement the broadcasting policy objectives set out in the Broadcasting Act by seeking a balance between registering small or medium-sized undertakings and the need to minimize the regulatory burden on small undertakings that do not benefit from having its operator form part of a broadcasting ownership group.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, adopting the same threshold used in the Digital Media Survey would be inappropriate given that the purpose of that survey was different than the objective of the Registrations Regulations and, therefore, targeted a different subset of undertakings. Further, given that the information to be requested as part of the registration process is of a different nature and is significantly less detailed than the information requested as part of the Digital Media Survey, the Commission finds that it would be reasonable for the registration threshold to be lower than that established for the Digital Media Survey, commensurate with the lower regulatory burden.\n\nMoreover, based on the information available to the Commission, registering online video services only when they have revenues over $50 million, and only those online audio services with more than $25 million in revenue, would provide an incomplete picture of the online Canadian broadcasting landscape.\n\nA $10 million threshold would include online services offered by a larger number of broadcasting ownership groups, which would include a more representative set of broadcasting ownership groups. A higher level would exclude many medium‑sized undertakings, impairing the Commission’s ability to fully understand and therefore regulate and supervise these aspects of the broadcasting ecosystem.\n\nFurther, given the very limited information that would be requested as part of the registration process, it is reasonable to expect that a $10 million threshold for registration would not deter services from entering the Canadian market, nor push those who have reached the $10 million threshold to leave that market.\n\nIn regard to the request made by several interveners to allow for online undertakings to register on a voluntary basis, the Commission notes that the objective of the registration process is to provide it, and in turn the Canadian public, with a picture of the broadcasting system that is as complete and accurate as possible. In the Commission’s view, an opt-in approach with voluntary registration would result in a distorted view of the broadcasting system and would be complex to administer. Consequently, the Commission does not consider that it would be appropriate for online undertakings to register on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn regard to the proposal to set different thresholds for different types of undertakings (specifically, for undertakings that provide either audio or video content), the Commission notes that several broadcasting ownership groups offer both types of services. To the extent that online undertakings whose operator forms part of a broadcasting ownership group of which the annual Canadian gross revenues exceed the monetary threshold for exemption, they would be required to be registered with the Commission in any case. Given that the monetary threshold is applied at the group level, distinct revenue thresholds between audio and video services within that group would be mostly irrelevant, since all online undertakings whose operator form part of that group, regardless of whether they provide audio or video services, would be required to be registered.\n\nIn addition, setting different thresholds for audio and video services would add little value as the $10 million threshold is sufficient to ensure that the Commission collects relevant data from both types of services. Based on the information on traditional broadcasters that is available, halving the threshold as the Commission did in regard to the Digital Media Survey, which would set the threshold at $5 million for audio programs, would not capture a significant number of additional players.\n\nAs for using separate thresholds for English- and French-language markets, the Commission notes that several online undertakings offer English, French and multilingual content. In fact, these online undertakings offer much of their content in multiple languages. It would therefore not be simple or perhaps even possible to distinguish between language-specific revenues from services that operate in both English and French. Consequently, the Commission does not consider that it would be appropriate to establish different exemption thresholds for undertakings that operate in English or in French markets.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission has adopted an exemption threshold of $10 million in annual Canadian gross revenues, as proposed in the Notice. Such a threshold should provide the Commission with sufficient information about online undertakings operating in the Canadian broadcasting market, while allowing independent smaller online undertakings to reach a certain level of revenues before being required to register.\n\nThe Commission notes that the exemption from registration should not impact any potential rights of or benefits for online services as a result of their exemption status. For example, exemption from registration should not preclude online undertakings from qualifying for funding in the future. Further, registration of an online undertaking does not in and of itself indicate that the undertaking will be exempt from all potential regulatory requirements.\n\nVideo game services\n\nIn the Notice, the Commission proposed to exempt online undertakings whose single activity and purpose consists of providing video game services. This exemption is also included under excluded revenue, meaning that any revenue that originates from providing video game services is excluded from the annual revenue calculation.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nInterveners who commented on this issueFootnote 31 generally supported the Commission’s proposal to exempt video game services from the requirement to register, with minimal caveats.\n\nThe most contentious issues arising from the exclusion of video game services relate to the integration of some broadcasting elements in video games. ACCORD, who noted that some online video game services have started broadcasting virtual concerts as part of their digital worlds, argued that these types of transmission activities should be covered by the Commission’s mandate, even if they take place in the context of a video game. It added that these exemptions would need to be monitored and that definitions would need to be adapted as service models evolve and change. The DOC supported ACCORD’s view and noted that although video game services should be exempt, their service models are adapting to include broadcasting activities that should be monitored by the Commission. It argued that exemption should therefore be monitored going forward to prepare for any changes.\n\nARRQ-GMMQ-SARTEC-UDA considered that the exemptions should not be blanket exemptions, and that if an online undertaking carries out broadcasting activities as part of its video game services, this should not result in an automatic exemption. In their view, given that recent developments in the video game services market have overlapped with broadcasting activities, such services act as broadcasters and therefore should not be exempt.\n\nThe CMF stated that the Commission’s definition for “video game” as proposed in the Notice is based on the notion of interactivity between the game and the user, and that this notion does not apply to new immersive online worlds offering XR3 productionsFootnote 32 involving “passive reception” of sound and visual images. It therefore questioned whether this definition includes augmented reality,Footnote 33 virtual realityFootnote 34 and mixed reality,Footnote 35 and other types of content in the immersive and/or interactive world (collectively referred to here as XR). In its view, confusion is possible because many XR applications might be considered video games, and many video games may be played using virtual reality. It added that several XR applications might not be considered as games because they do not involve active interaction, but rather passive reception of sounds and visual images. In its view, these ambiguities merit consideration for regulation that is responsive to technological developments. The APFC agreed with this position.\n\nTikTok considered that the proposed video game services exemption should be broadened in scope. It argued that the concept of “single activity” is too limiting, as there are very few, if any, video game services (or software services) that have no other (ancillary) audio/video streaming activities. As such, TikTok stated that the description of this class of undertaking, as proposed in Appendix 2 to the Notice, be amended to refer to online undertakings whose primary purpose (rather than single activity and purpose) consists of providing video game services. In TikTok’s view, this amendment would allow the Commission to exercise flexibility and discretion when it comes to the continually evolving ways that Canadians use these platforms.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nAside from the circumstances considered in Public Notice 1995-5 in regard to the Exemption order respecting video games programming service undertakings, set out in the appendix to that public notice, the Commission has historically held the view that the transmission of video games does not constitute broadcasting. The Commission notes that it is not changing that view in the present regulatory policy.\n\nHowever, the Commission notes that video games have evolved considerably and the games themselves may now, or in the future, include some broadcasting activity. Nevertheless, in the Commission’s view, online undertakings that provide such video game services currently have a relatively marginal place in the Canadian broadcasting system. Due to the unique nature of video games within the system, the Commission is of the view that, to the extent online undertakings provide video game services, registration information concerning these undertakings would not further the policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act at this time. The Commission notes that exempting online undertakings that provide video game services would be consistent with the proposed Direction, which directs the Commission to not impose regulatory requirements on broadcasting undertakings in respect of the transmission of video game services.\n\nWith respect to online undertakings that provide video game services in addition to other broadcasting services, the Commission considers that it would be important for those online undertakings to register. The rationale for exempting video game service providers does not apply if there are other broadcasting services being provided. Indeed, such online undertakings may well generate significant revenues from video-on-demand (VOD) services, for example. Accordingly, the Commission finds that it would not be appropriate to amend the class of exempted undertaking, as proposed by certain interveners, to exempt from the requirement to register online undertakings whose primary purpose consists of providing video game services. Nevertheless, the Commission notes that revenues derived from providing video game services are excluded from the calculation of “annual revenues” used for the purpose of determining whether an online undertaking should be exempted from the requirement to register.\n\nThe Commission therefore finds that compliance with the registration requirements by online undertakings whose single activity and purpose is the provision of video game services would not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1) of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission has retained the exemption for online undertakings whose single activity and purpose consists of providing video game services, as proposed in the Notice.\n\nThe Commission intends to continue monitoring the sector as it evolves.\n\nUnique transactions\n\nIn the Notice, the Commission proposed exempting from the requirement to register online undertakings whose single activity and purpose consists of providing unique transactions. In the proposed exemption order, the Commission defined “unique transaction” as a one-time rental or purchase of an individual program transmitted or retransmitted over the Internet.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nInterveners who supportedFootnote 36 the proposed exemption noted that these unique transaction services are a digital evolution of the “brick and mortar” music and video stores, which were not previously subject to the Commission’s regulatory requirements. These interveners expressed concern over the potential impacts that imposing registration on transaction-based services may have on these services. In this regard, Amazon noted that revenues of transaction-based services are declining relative to subscription-based streaming services. It also noted, as did BCE, that those services already contribute to the system through investments of time and money in content creation, promotion and interaction with consumers.\n\nApple, Amazon and the ITIC urged the Commission to follow the proposed Direction to adopt equitable regulation that accounts for the nature of an undertaking. Apple noted that extending registration to transactional VOD (TVOD) entities would, as argued by other interveners, be neither equitable nor principled. It noted that the transactional nature of purchasing or renting music or videos affords less control over the content, given the reliance on third parties. The interveners argued that the TVOD business model is different than the subscription business model, which operates on a curation model driven by relationships with their rights holders and customer base.\n\nAccording to the ITIC, unique transaction services such as TVOD services are primarily content marketplaces, rather than services that carry on a broadcasting activity, and work on a unique business model. It echoed other parties’ concerns over the potential imposition of excessive regulatory obligations on services that fall beyond the core scope of the broadcasting policy, as well as the potential implications for the public’s perception of the regulatory system as a whole in Canada.\n\nApple also commented on the importance of the need to remain technology agnostic in implementing the Broadcasting Act, noting that the services it provides are akin to home videos and serve to complement traditional broadcasting services. It added that the purpose of the present proceeding is not to simply extend all broadcasting regulations to the online world.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) supported the proposed exemption and sought further clarity on the definition of a one-time rental or purchase of an individual program. It voiced concerns about how its revenues may be calculated for the purpose of determining whether it can be exempted. Similarly, the MPAC, though in favour of the proposed exemption, sought more information as to why the exemption was specific only to this model while other models (e.g., free ad‑supported television [FAST], subscription-based VOD [SVOD] and advertising‑based VOD [AVOD]) also exist.\n\nA greater number of interveners opposedFootnote 37 the proposed exemption. They considered that the Commission did not provide sufficient rationale for exempting those services, and sought further clarification on the Commission’s intent and rationale, and supporting evidence, for excluding this group of services from registration. Interveners argued that these services make a material contribution to the broadcast system since they are a key access point to feature films for large Canadian audiences, are growing in size and number,Footnote 38 and generate significant revenues.Footnote 39\n\nOther intervenersFootnote 40 submitted that it is too early to exempt unique transactions given their size and impact. The Ontario Educational Communications Authority (TVO) noted that the registration of TVOD services would help provide the Commission with a “complete picture” of the manner in which programs are provided to Canadian consumers by online undertakings. The DGC noted that much of TVOD service revenues are generated by global companies that are well positioned to support the creation, distribution and presentation of Canadian programming, and that TVOD services are but one of many services offered by the same online undertaking and should not be overlooked. Netflix noted that this exemption would apply to a significant segment of online undertakings despite TVOD service revenues, and argued that exempting these services would provide an incomplete landscape of operations of online undertakings.\n\nInterveners also submitted that regulatory approaches should be consistent with the objectives of the Broadcasting Act for the fair and equitable treatment of players in the broadcasting system, and that technology used to deliver the programming should not be the deciding factor in exempting them from registration. Interveners including the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Corus, the CPSC-SCFP, the DGC, the DOC, PIAC, Quebecor and TÃ©lÃ©film Canada considered unique transaction services to be similar to currently licensed BDUs that offer TVOD services and currently fall under the Commission’s regulatory requirements. As such, they questioned why unique transactions online should be treated differently. TELUS also noted the need for regulatory symmetry, and proposed extending the exemption to licensed VOD services.\n\nThe DOC and the APFC, noting that the Broadcasting Act specifically states at paragraph 3(1)(e) that “each element of the Canadian broadcasting system shall contribute in an appropriate manner to the creation and presentation of Canadian programming,” argued that excluding a significant element of the Canadian broadcasting system at this early stage does not seem to be an appropriate action. Saskatchewan Telecommunications (SaskTel) added that the only difference between online VOD services and the on-demand services provided on traditional broadcast platforms is the provision of content via a managed network instead of over the Internet.\n\nThe CAB also requested regulatory symmetry, and considered that TVOD services both on traditional broadcast platforms and online should be either regulated or unregulated. It recognized, however, as did Cogeco, that there is no parallel in the broadcasting system for online undertakings that sell music on a transactional basis, and argued that it would therefore be appropriate to exempt such services. Unifor submitted that method or frequency of payment (subscription fee versus one-time rental) should not be a determining factor in regard to whether or not a service should be exempted.\n\nThe APFC noted that other foreign jurisdictions that already regulate online undertakings, such as France, require TVOD services and other transactional services to contribute to the broadcasting ecosystem at the same level as online streaming platforms. According to the APFC, these jurisdictions do not distinguish between traditional and online undertakings. It also countered the position of other interveners that online undertakings offering transaction-based broadcasting are unique and different from the traditional pay-per-view (PPV) or other VOD services given their lack of control on content, and because their business models are less relationship-driven. In this regard, the WGC argued that such services exercise full control over programs offered to users by definition of “programming control” within the Broadcasting Act. It added that online services providing unique transactions also have an ongoing service relationship, such as a customer account, payment and other information, so that the relationship is maintained over time.\n\nFinally, the CBC and the CMPA noted that models will continue to evolve. The CMPA further noted the risk that online undertakings, with their flexibility of developing consumer offers, will broaden the application of any exemption by categorizing subscription activity as being transactional in nature (as demonstrated by Amazon’s initial request to expand the exemption to subscriptions). They also noted the risk of traditional BDUs requesting an exemption of VOD services in the name of equitability. In this regard, BCE, Eastlink, the CAB, Cogeco, Quebecor, SaskTel and TELUS, all of whom opposed the exemption, stated that they would all seek regulatory equity for traditional BDUs if the Commission proceeds with the exemption. In their view, the lack of regulatory obligations imposed on unique transaction online undertakings would create an unjust and unfair advantage for those undertakings.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nAs noted above, the issue here is whether the Commission should exercise its power to exempt from the Registration Regulations undertakings that transmit or retransmit programs over the Internet for reception by the public by means of broadcasting receiving apparatus if the programs are “rented” for a one-time viewing or “purchased” once to allow for access on an ongoing basis. This type of service is described herein as a “unique transaction service”.\n\nAs a result of this proceeding, it appears to the Commission that the overall market in Canada for unique transaction services provided by online undertakings, while divided among a number of players, can be considered significant. In light of this, the Commission considers it premature to exempt these services, as proposed, as doing so could mean that the Commission would not be able to collect information and ensure that some measure of basic regulatory oversight is maintained during this transition period. This could have significant ramifications for its ability to implement the broadcasting policy objectives set out in the Broadcasting Act.\n\nThe Commission notes that the business models for broadcasting, along with the technology, have continuously evolved over the course of the history of broadcasting. Whether scheduled only or on demand; advertising- or subscription-based; VOD or PPV; or requiring payment for ongoing access to the program, it is neither the payment method nor the moment in which the public can access (or re‑access) a program, but the fact that these services all involve the transmission of programs by means of telecommunications for reception by the public by means of broadcasting receiving apparatus that makes them significant from the perspective of the broadcasting policy for Canada.\n\nFundamentally, the broadcasting policy for Canada does not specifically distinguish between scheduled and on-demand broadcasting, or between subscription- or transaction-based services. Indeed, the Commission is tasked with exercising its powers in a manner that, among many other things, is readily adaptable to technological change and that takes into account the diversity of the services provided by broadcasting undertakings.\n\nThe Commission recognizes that online undertakings and BDUs provide their unique transaction services under different circumstances â transmission by online undertakings over the Internet rather than by BDUs over managed networks â and differ in regard to the nature of the relationship with their customers. Further, BDUs may provide one-time transactions through the use of specific hardware and software provided by the BDU as part of the subscription service offered to the customer. Nevertheless, it is the similarities of the services that are important from the perspective of implementing the policy objectives set out in the Broadcasting Act, and specifically here the requirement to register with the Commission to implement these objectives. The unique transaction services offered by BDUs and online undertakings offer a catalogue of programs available to customers: both types of undertakings exercise control over programming as they decide which content is offered, and may set the price charged to the customer for accessing the content. Moreover, services provided by online undertakings that involve “renting” the program for one-time viewing are akin, in particular, to the VOD and PPV services offered by BDUs. Therefore, exempting from the registration requirement online undertakings that provide unique transaction services merely because they transmit or retransmit the programs by means of the Internet would result in unjustifiable regulatory asymmetry between traditional and online services.\n\nMoreover, without registration information from online undertakings that provide unique transaction services, given the nature of the services and their increasing size and number, the Commission would have a distorted picture of the online broadcasting system.\n\nFinally, the Commission notes that exempting online undertakings providing unique transactions services â i.e., based primarily on the method of payment â could unintentionally and inappropriately lead to a shift toward providing services in this fashion in order to qualify for exemption.\n\nIn light of all of the above, the Commission concludes that exempting from registration the class of online undertakings that provide unique transactions services could have a material impact on its ability to implement the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, including, for example, those set out in paragraphs 3(1)(a.1),Footnote 41 3(1)(f.1),Footnote 42 3(1)(q),Footnote 43 and 3(1)(r)Footnote 44 of that Act.\n\nThe Commission therefore finds that it is premature to exempt from registration online undertakings that provide unique transaction services. In the Commission’s view, the better course would be to register such undertakings so as to permit the Commission to better monitor their development and examine, in the context of future proceedings, how such services should be treated. The Commission has amended the exemption order accordingly.\n\nThe Commission notes that other jurisdictions are struggling with the same questions and that some have taken the view that transactional services should be captured within the scope of broadcasting regulation. As of March 2023, all EU states have implemented the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) and currently regulate VOD services in some form. There is some flexibility in the way in which the AVMSD may be implemented, but many member states have implemented quotas for EU and national content, and some have elected to apply investment obligations.Footnote 45\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that compliance with the registration requirement will contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1) of the Broadcasting Act. The Commission therefore finds that it is not necessary, and would not be appropriate, to exempt from the requirement to register online undertakings that provide unique transaction services. Accordingly, the Commission has not included in the exemption order the proposed class of online undertaking whose single activity and purpose consist of providing unique transactions.\n\nSocial media services\n\nThe Broadcasting Act distinguishes between the content uploaded by users of social media services, the persons who upload content, and the social media services themselves.Footnote 46\n\nSubsection 4.1(1) of the Broadcasting Act stipulates that the Act does not apply in respect of a program that is uploaded to an online undertaking that provides a social media service by a user of the service for transmission over the Internet and reception by other users of the service. However, as set out in subsection 4.1(2), despite subsection 4.1(1), the Broadcasting Act does apply in respect of a program that is uploaded as described in that subsection if the program (a) is uploaded to the social media service by the provider of the service or the provider’s affiliate, or by the agent or mandatary of either of them; or (b) is prescribed by regulations made under section 4.2 of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nThe Broadcasting Act also does not apply to the person who uploads such content insofar as they are deemed under subsection 2(2.1) not to be carrying on a broadcasting undertaking. Specifically, a person who uses a social media service to upload programs for transmission over the Internet and reception by other users of the service â and who is not the provider of the service or the provider’s affiliate, or the agent or mandatary of either of them â is deemed not, by the fact of that use, to carry on a broadcasting undertaking for the purposes of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nFurther, subsection 4.1(3) of the Broadcasting Act stipulates that the Act does not apply in respect of online undertakings whose broadcasting consists only of programs in respect of which the Broadcasting Act does not apply under this section.\n\nPositions of parties\n\nWhile interveners agreed that the content uploaded by users on social media is not covered by the Broadcasting Act, there was disagreement as to whether social media platforms, which may contain broadcasting programs in addition to social media content, should be exempted from the requirement to register.\n\nMost associations, including the CAB and ACCORD, argued that social media platforms such as Facebook (owned by Meta), TikTok, and YouTube (owned by Google) directly compete with radio and television services for content, audience, and advertising. As such, these interveners, along with the CMPA, the IBG and PIAC, opposed exempting social media services from the requirement to register. They also noted a distinction between regulating the individual users of social media services (i.e., creators) and regulating social media services.\n\nThe IBG noted that paragraph 3(1)(q) of the Broadcasting Act, which was added following the coming into force of the Online Streaming Act, includes broadcasting policy objectives that relate specifically to online undertakings that provide the programming services of other broadcasting undertakings. For the IBG, “numerous other objectives and powers of the Commission could be exercised only in relation to service aggregators, which are poised to become the BDU[s] of the future.”\n\nFinally, PIAC submitted that while the Broadcasting Act does not apply to creators of digital content, online undertakings that provide the platforms for this content are not so clearly exempted.\n\nOther interveners, including Digital First Canada, Google, Meta, TikTok, the ITIC, Vaxination Informatique and individual interveners, as well as social media platforms, supported the exemption of social media platforms altogether from the requirement to register. One of the individual interveners argued that social media services should be exempted on the grounds that registering social media services is not likely to contribute in any manner to the implementation of the objectives of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nMeta supported this claim and explained that social media platforms have no material impact on the Canadian broadcasting system. It argued that these platforms are not like traditional television since they do not select programs and since the volume of content is not limited by a few available channels, nor do they produce and/or distribute professionally produced programming pursuant to commercial carriage agreements.\n\nMeta further submitted that the Broadcasting Act does not apply to social media online undertakings whose broadcasting consists of programs of social media creators.Footnote 47 It argued that its services are primarily not broadcasting, and that any programs that might be considered to be broadcasting are the creations of its users, who are social media creators. Further, Meta argued that the broadcasting activities on its services are minimal and entirely ancillary to the predominant purpose of its services, which is to help people connect with friends and family, to help build communities and to help grow businesses.Footnote 48\n\nAccording to TikTok, if video game services are exempted because they are not broadcasting, social media content, which has never been considered broadcasting, must also be exempted to avoid any ambiguity. Although the intervener agreed that social media services could provide content that is also available through a licensed or registered broadcasting undertaking, it argued that this should not preclude the exemption of these services. In TikTok’s view, the determinative factor should be whether the primary function of the social media service is to access social media content. It therefore proposed exempting online undertakings whose primary purpose consists of providing a social media service.\n\nGoogle also considered that online undertakings of which the primary function is to serve as a platform for the dissemination of user-generated content, namely, social media services, should not be subject to the same regulatory framework as that for traditional broadcasting undertakings. It added that exempting social media services would be consistent with the Commission’s statement that it does not intend to regulate any aspect of a social media service, and that this was the clear intention of Parliament.\n\nVaxination Informatique submitted that, whatever the business model of a social media platform, any requirement imposed would ultimately be passed on to social media creators. As a consequence, creators would be harmed through a reduction in revenues.\n\nThe ITIC supported the exemption of social media platforms hosting user-generated content given that such platforms lack editorial control and do not exert any programming control over broadcast content. It added that exempting undertakings that provide social media services would be consistent with the proposed Direction, avoid potential unintended consequences that could impact Canadian consumers, and reflect the Government of Canada’s legislative intent.\n\nFinally, an individual intervener warned that a regulatory framework that uses a content-based approach risks turning the Commission into a content moderator, making specific decisions about the types of content that are covered by the Broadcasting Act.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nAs noted above, pursuant to subsection 9(4) of the Broadcasting Act, the Commission is required to exempt from regulations, including the Registration Regulations, broadcasting undertakings of any class it specifies if the Commission is satisfied that compliance with the requirements will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in subsection 3(1).\n\nIt appears clear at this point that social media platforms play a large and increasingly dominant role in terms of the Canadian online broadcasting advertising market. This alone would seem to point towards a need to register such services to enable the Commission to gather further information and monitor their impact, where necessary. In addition, exempting all or a subset of online undertakings that provide social media services would require that the class of undertakings to be exempted be clearly defined. Through the proceeding initiated by Broadcasting Notice of Consultation 2023-138, the Commission has only just begun to explore the concept of social media and the role, if any, that social media platforms may play in the broadcasting system, should they engage in activities that are subject to the Broadcasting Act. That proceeding is only a first step â future proceedings will likely be necessary to delineate more clearly a regulatory approach to these services.\n\nGiven the ongoing proceedings that are considering various issues surrounding the definitions of social media services and their activities that are subject to the Broadcasting Act, the Commission is of the view that it would be premature to define a class or classes of online undertakings specific to social media undertakings for the purposes of the exemption order. More importantly, even if there were such clarity on definitions, the registration information from social media online undertakings that are subject to the Broadcasting Act is essential at this point in the development of the Commission’s new regulatory framework under the amended Broadcasting Act. Taking into account the minimal regulatory burden imposed by the proposed Registration Regulations, the Commission finds that imposing a registration requirement on social media services would be appropriate, at least for the time being.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, it is essential, however, to distinguish between online undertakings that provide social media services and the users that upload content to these services. While the undertakings providing the social media services are required to register with the Commission, the users of these services are not.Footnote 49 Even users that may earn $10 million or more annually from content uploaded to social media services are not required to register with the Commission.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that it is neither necessary nor appropriate at this time to exempt from the Registration Regulations online undertakings that provide social media services. The Commission recognizes that the requirement to register may need to be reviewed in the future once the Commission has collected sufficient information on these services, and once it has provided more clarity and resolved a variety of issues concerning these services. Finally, for the sake of clarity, the Registration Regulations only apply to those social media online undertakings that are subject to the Broadcasting Act and, further, do not apply to users of social media services.\n\nContent-related categories\n\nThematic services\n\nPositions of parties\n\nFor the purposes of the present proceeding, the MPAC introduced the concept of “thematic service,” which it defined as a service that due to its nature or theme of service will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy objectives of the Broadcasting Act, and should therefore be given special consideration by the Commission (i.e., should be exempted from the requirement to register). An individual intervener proposed adding to this class of services “specialty services,” which it defined as undertakings whose primary broadcasting activities consist of distributing programs associated with a particular nation/region, foreign language or cultural group.\n\nAccording to the MPAC, the Commission should only exempt a thematic service if it is satisfied that it will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy set out in the Broadcasting Act. The UFC proposed that exemption eligibility be based on a qualitative application process where undertakings can submit written applications as to why a service considers that it does not compete with Canadian services or does not materially impact the Canadian broadcasting industry.\n\nSimilarly, Apple requested the exemption of fitness services, which it defined as services that consist primarily of programs promoting health and fitness via guided workouts and similar features, such as Apple Fitness +, provided over the Internet.\n\nCertain interveners opposed exempting “thematic services” as defined by the MPAC. The CMPA expressed concerns that such an exemption category would lack specificity and be a blanket exemption. Corus also took issue with the MPAC’s definition of thematic services and its proposal to exempt such services from the requirement to register, stating that the intervener did not provide any limiting principle or other supplementary interpretive guide, and that adoption of such a proposal could lead to regulatory uncertainty and inequity.\n\nThe CAB also expressed concern over the proposals to exclude broad categories of services, arguing that thematic and ad-support programming services directly compete with television and radio services for content, audiences and advertising.\n\nAccording to the CMPA, exemption status is not necessary for specific programming genres of a service given that the Commission has proposed a threshold based on a level of revenues that, when met, indicates that a service has the potential to contribute in a material manner to the policy objectives, and therefore should be subject to regulation regardless of content.\n\nAn individual intervener submitted that a content-based exemption approach could risk turning the Commission into a content moderator, and that adding further regulatory requirements depending on the content provided would make the Commission determine which content should be exempted.\n\nFinally, ARRQ-GMMQ-SARTEC-UDA did not agree with Apple’s recommendation to exempt fitness‑related services if all other criteria are met for registration.\n\nCommission’s decision\n\nExempting any kind of content based on its theme would require assessing such content, which involves a certain level of subjectivity. Further, exemptions based on content would provide some uncertainty to online broadcasters, as well as utilize significant resources from both online broadcasters and the Commission to process.\n\nFurther, exempting thematic services from the requirement to register would hamper the Commission’s ability to assess whether these services provide broadcasting services in English and in French, which in turn would make it more difficult for the Commission to fulfil broadcasting policy objectives, such as that set out in paragraph 3(1)(k) of the Broadcasting Act, which provides that a range of broadcasting services in English and in French shall be extended to all Canadians. Thematic services are also of interest to persons with disabilities, and not having basic information on those services would limit the capacity of the Commission to achieve the broadcasting policy objective set out in paragraph 3(1)(p.1) of the Broadcasting Act, which states that “programming that is accessible without barriers to persons with disabilities should be provided within the Canadian broadcasting system, including without limitation, closed captioning services and described video services available to assist persons living with a visual or auditory impairment.” It is therefore important for the Commission to monitor whether these services continue to be provided, for the benefit of Canadians who may rely on them.\n\nFinally, creating too many additional exemption categories would limit the purpose of creating a registry, specifically, to gather information to help the Commission to better understand the Canadian online broadcasting landscape more generally. In this regard, exempting certain categories of thematic services would limit the capacity of the Commission to assess whether the programming provided by the Canadian broadcasting system is varied and comprehensive, providing a balance of information, enlightenment and entertainment for people of all ages, interests and tastes, as required pursuant to subparagraph 3(1)(i)(i) of the Broadcasting Act. It would also make it more difficult for the Commission to determine whether thematic services are contributing to the achievement of paragraphs 3(1)(k) and 3(1)(p.1) of the Broadcasting Act.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that it would not be appropriate to exempt the broad category of thematic services as defined by the MPAC from the requirement to register.\n\nOnline news services\n\nPositions of parties\n\nThe CAB proposed that the Commission explicitly exempt online news services so that there is no distinction between news providers whose programming consists predominantly of alphanumeric text and those who would be considered to be broadcasting audio or video “programs”. It argued that this would also keep the Commission from having to measure and track the point at which a website becomes mainly textual, and therefore lies outside of the scope of the Broadcasting Act. The CAB warned that not adopting such an exemption would provide an incomplete picture of the market and may even encourage some operators to tailor their offerings to put a greater emphasis on text versus video to avoid registration. The CAB also noted that a broadcaster’s website is generally made up of content created for its linear channels, which is already subject to the Commission’s oversight. Other interveners, including Rogers, Pelmorex, BCE, Corus, Apple and an individual, supported the CAB’s proposal.\n\nCorus urged the Commission to exempt online news for competitive reasons. It noted that online news sites associated with licensed news broadcasters compete with the online news sites of print publications and international media organizations. Corus considered that it is not the Commission’s intent to regulate websites such as those for the Globe and Mail, and that the playing field should therefore be level for news sites associated with Canadian broadcast news organizations.\n\nBCE submitted that such an exemption would be in the public interest. It argued that there is no need to ensure these undertakings contribute to Canadian culture since they do so by definition, by providing news and stories that cover Canada and the world. BCE raised a point similar to that of the CAB in that regulation may create a disparity of treatment between online providers who offer mostly videos versus those who offer mainly text. Rogers and Apple agreed with this rationale.\n\nThe WGC opposed exempting online news services from the requirement to register. It considered that the Commission is only gathering information through registration, an"
