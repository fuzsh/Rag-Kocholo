        "text": "As the Commission continues to implement regulatory changes that were promulgated in October 2023, information contained on these webpages may require updates and/or verification by applicants and licensees in order to maintain compliance. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nThe Commission held an Applicant Forum on January 23, 2020 to hear directly from applicants for licensure and all other constituents about their experience with Massachusetts’ licensing process. This Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is a summary of the most frequently raised issues discussed during that session.\n\nComprehensive answers to many questions about Massachusetts’ Marijuana Establishment licensing process can be found in the Guidance on Licensure.\n\nSocial Equity Program-specific questions and answers are also covered here.\n\nPlease note: The Commission is prohibited from providing applicants with legal advice or business consultation.\n\nWhy is my application taking so long to be reviewed?\n\nThe Commission is committed to ensuring applications are reviewed for completeness and conform with state regulations and laws. Rather than give applicants only one opportunity to submit all their required materials before going to the Commission for a vote, Commission staff reopens applications and works with applicants to obtain all of the information needed before a recommendation is made to Commissioners to approve or deny the application. Applications may need to be reopened to get more information from the applicants. Incomplete applications cannot be approved. Commission staff are working as quickly as possible to process applications while maintaining a deep commitment to maintaining a safe and fair licensed industry.\n\nState law mandates that Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MTCs) and Certified Economic Empowerment applicants receive priority review. Licensing Department staff follow state law by reviewing these applications first, followed by general applications. Recently, the Commission voted to grant expedited review status to other application categories. Expedited applications are those submitted by Social Equity participants, Marijuana Microbusiness applicants, Craft Marijuana Cooperative applicants, Independent Testing Laboratory applicants, Outdoor Marijuana Cultivator applicants, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, and veteran-owned businesses.\n\nCannabis prohibition disproportionately affected my community and me, but I don’t see licenses going to this community. Does the Commission care about equity?\n\nYes. The Commission is committed to ensuring an equitable industry is developed in accordance with state law and its mission statement. Various policies and programs,\n\nincluding the nation’s first statewide Social Equity Program, have been designed to address the disproportionate impact of the War on Drugs on certain populations and communities.\n\nCertified Economic Empowerment applicants and Social Equity Program applicants receive benefits through the Commission, including the following:\n\nPriority or expedited review in the Commission’s licensing review process when a completed license application is received;\n\nFee waivers;\n\nPre-certification and exclusive access to social consumption and delivery licenses for two years when applications become available; and\n\nExclusive access to certain license types\n\nQualified Social Equity Program participants also are eligible for training and technical assistance across four teaching tracks. The first cohort of program participants are expected to complete their training this spring. As noted above, the Commission also expedites the review of applications for certified Women-, Minority-, and Veteran-Owned businesses to the head of the licensing queue irrespective of their status as a Certified Economic Empowerment applicant or Social Equity Program participant.\n\nTo hold itself accountable on this issue, the Commission provides the public ongoing access to licensee and Marijuana Establishment (ME) agent data through the Commission’s Open Data Platform and regular data updates at monthly public meetings.\n\nCan the Commission grant me a license before I have a business location?\n\nNo. In order to receive a license for an ME, applicants must have a location designated. Applicants must also have the approval of the municipality in which they are located, through a Host Community Agreement (HCA). The Commission does not require that the property is fully built-out at the time of application. After receiving a Provisional License, licensees may submit to the Commission an Architectural Review Plan. If approved, licensees may then build their facility.\n\nMunicipalities may have their own zoning and other local ordinances that must be complied with as well. Municipal information can often be difficult to find, so the Commission has created a Municipal Zoning Tracker to assist in locating that information. For more guidance on zoning or siting issues, we recommend you contact the municipality within which you hope to locate your business. You can locate the appropriate contact information by clicking on the name of the municipality in the Municipal Zoning Tracker. The Commission has also developed a Guidance for Municipalities on Equity and Host Community Agreements that offers guidance and tips to cities and towns.\n\nWill the Commission consider waiving the requirement for an interest in property or real estate?\n\nSocial Equity Program participants as well as Certified Economic Empowerment applicants seeking a Social Consumption license may get pre-certified prior to submitting a full application. Pre- certification does not require a specific location or HCA to be submitted. Please note, however, that full applications require the entity be tied to a specific location, and often the various plans and policies are tied to that location. For instance, the Commission is concerned about how the entity intends to secure the specific facility and how the entity intends to positively impact the individuals that were disproportionately harmed in that region.\n\nWhy can’t I get pre-certified before I am required to complete the total application?\n\nThe pre-certification application will be available to those who wish to apply for Delivery- Only and Social Consumption Licenses when they become available. Please see page 40 of the Guidance on Licensure for additional details.\n\nCan the Commission assign an Application Manager to be a point-person for me and to ensure my application gets reviewed by only one individual?\n\nCommission staff have reviewed the suggestion that applicants be assigned an individual Licensing Department staff member so that applicants know who to contact for more information and to get updates on their application reviews. Currently, applications are reviewed based on priority/expedited status and then by the time the application is initially received. Staff conduct supplemental reviews based in the same order and having an individual assigned to a single application could preclude staff from following this policy. The Commission recently increased personnel in the Licensing Department to meet demand and will continue to review applications quickly and thoroughly.\n\nWhy can’t dedicated Commission staff give advice to Certified Economic Empowerment applicants?\n\nThe Commission is a regulatory agency responsible for reviewing ME applications and determining whether the applications are compliant with Adult-Use (935 CMR 500.00) and Medical-Use (935 CMR 501.000) regulations. Our role as regulators prevents us from providing one-on-one guidance on how to write an application for any applicant, regardless of their status.\n\nWhile we are prohibited from providing one-on-one consultation, the Commission can and does provide clarification on licensing requirements and our interpretation of the regulations via guidance documents. More specifically and as mentioned above, the Commission developed a guidance for the licensing process, which can be found here.\n\nCan Certified Economic Empowerment applicants obtain confirmation or documentation demonstrating their status to be used in municipal and other interactions?\n\nYes. The Licensing Department has previously communicated with Certified Economic Empowerment applicants regarding how they may obtain this documentation. Please contact Licensing@CCCMass.com to receive this notice.\n\nCan the Commission help me fill out my Social Equity Program application?\n\nYes, since the Social Equity Program is not a license type, the Commission is able to assist. The Commission is planning three clinic events in the coming months at computer labs across the Commonwealth in order to assist individuals with their Social Equity Program applications in real time. Please sign up for the Social Equity Program’s mailing list here to receive details when they are released.\n\nCan the Commission work one-on-one with us to prepare our applications?\n\nNo. Please see Questions #6 and #7 above. The Commission has, however, developed an in-depth Guidance on Licensure which aims to serve as a manual for the application process.\n\nThe Commission has also established a Social Equity Program that aims to provide eligible participants with training and technical assistance ranging from the application process to successfully operating any of the available license types. The Program also includes tracks for entry-level employment as well as ancillary business types. Applications for the second cohort of this program will be accepted until May 1, 2020.\n\nWhy isn’t there guidance for financing your business?\n\nThe Commission does not require you to have a specific or minimum amount of capital for your business, but we do ask you to disclose the amounts and sources of any capital. The Commission published a Guidance for Business for all license applicants in 2018. For best advice around business planning, however, the Commission recommends that applicants consult a licensed attorney, accountant, financial advisor, or other professional service, who can advocate for you and advise you on what is in your business’ best interests. Ultimately, it is the applicant’s responsibility to prudently finance their business in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the Commission is prohibited from providing applicants with direct legal advice or business consultation. Please note that many professional service providers, such as those listed above, may offer discounts or pro bono services to certain applicants (e.g. Certified Economic Empowerment applicants, Social Equity Program participants, disadvantaged business enterprises, etc.).\n\nWhy is only one business owner listed on the portal?\n\nTypically, one person associated with the license application is listed as its primary contact within the Massachusetts Cannabis Industry Portal (MassCIP). The business email address provided is used for all correspondence between the applicant and the Commission during license application review.\n\nThe MassCIP shows all individuals and entities that have an ownership or control interest of 10% or more in an ME. Extensive records are kept regarding who is involved with the proposed business, along with their background information and required disclosures.\n\nWhy doesn’t the Commission host meetings around the state more often?\n\nThe Commission has hosted many meetings Commonwealth-wide and will continue to host public hearings throughout the state over the course of its regulatory development process. The agency recently moved its headquarters from Boston to Worcester, in large part because of its central location and accessibility to constituents throughout the Commonwealth. The Union Station headquarters and its public meeting space are accessible by public transit, including the commuter rail, and also has garage parking available. The Commission publishes all public meeting materials and livestreams its public meetings to its social media pages online so that those interested in viewing the meeting can watch if they cannot attend in person. Commission staff travel the state inspecting facilities and ensure that all licensees are in full compliance with the law.\n\nWhy are all MTCs allowed to get priority status instead of those who were already operational at the time the process began?\n\nThe law that established adult-use cannabis and the Commission (Ch. 55 of the Acts of 2017, 56) requires the Commission to give priority review status to MTCs and EEAs that received priority review status in April, 2018. The Commission adopted and implemented a policy in October 2019 that an applicant can only utilize its MTC priority status for an adult-use application where the proposed ME will be colocated with the MTC and perform the same type of operations.\n\nWhy can’t the Commission create a Social Equity Program fund?\n\nThe Commission does not have the legal authority to create a fund under state law. Only the Legislature has the authority to create laws and establish such funds. The Commission has, however, advocated for the establishment of such a fund.\n\nIs there a cap to the number of investors we can have?\n\nNo. There is no limit to the number of investors for an application. Depending upon their involvement in the proposed ME or their percentage of ownership or control, however, they may be required to be listed on the application itself and be subject to the Commission’s background check. State law does, however, limit the number of licenses in which any entity or individual may have an ownership or controlling interest, so applicants and licensees are reminded to consider license caps when investing in or contracting with MEs. Please refer to the guidances for business and licensure for more information.\n\nCan the Commission develop a timeline so applicants know when to expect these licensing decisions on their applications?\n\nThe Commission is finalizing a MassCIP update that will provide license applicants, and the public, with access to the application queue. This system will be publicly available and updated periodically to show an applicant’s progress in the licensing review process and queue.\n\nThis resource will detail whether an application is pending a review or was reopened to allow the applicant to provide new or updated information, and whether the application is receiving priority or expedited review. This information will help prospective licensees estimate the amount of time until they reach the next milestone in the process and anticipate business needs. Please sign up for our mailing list here to receive additional details on when this functionality will become available.\n\nThe Commission considers and reviews applications based on their submission date. Only those applicants that have been granted priority or expedited review would receive accelerated review of their materials. That status applies to both initial and any supplemental reviews.\n\nLicensing inspections occur at the request of licensees based on the readiness of their facility. Once requested, the Commission will schedule a time for staff to visit the facility and inspect for compliance. Once an entity has commenced their operations, the Commission may also conduct periodic unannounced inspections.\n\nWhy can’t the background check happen earlier in the licensing process?\n\nBackground checks are initiated once an application has been deemed complete and occur largely at the expense of the applicant. Prior to being deemed complete, an application may be amended several times, and those amendments may pertain to individuals or entities with ownership or control. If the Commission were to initiate a background check prior to an application being deemed complete, the entity may incur additional and unnecessary expenses.\n\nHistorically, some forms associated with the background check, once executed, were valid for only short periods of times (e.g. 90 days). This would often result in forms expiring while the application was pending, and ultimately require the application to be reopened for new forms to be executed. However, based on updates to the Commission’s background check that occurred several months ago, the existing forms are now valid for at least one calendar year once executed.\n\nPlease also refer to Question #5. The Commission’s pre-certification process grants some applicants seeking Social Consumption and Delivery-Only Licenses with the ability to have their background checks conducted earlier in the application process.\n\nWhy do I have another Request for Information (RFI) when I already had one previously?\n\nThere is no limit to the number of RFIs an applicant may receive; RFI notices are based upon a staff determination that the information contained in the application at the time of review is not substantially in compliance with the adult or medical use of marijuana regulations. The RFI enables the Commission to inform applicants about the specific sections of the application that require further information, clarification, or editing in order to demonstrate compliance with the applicable regulations.\n\nThe Commission reviews each application in its entirety, including all three individual packets, before issuing an RFI and does not restrict or limit the amount of time an applicant has to resubmit their application. Once resubmitted, the application returns to the queue based on its original timestamp and would continue to enjoy its priority or expedited status, if applicable.\n\nThe Commission reopened my application because I used LLc vs. LLC…why?\n\nThe Commission has not reopened an application solely based on capitalization typos. If the Commission identifies other problems with an application that result in an RFI being issued, staff will identify typographical errors, inconsistent business names, or other similar errors as well as the primary problems with the application in the RFI in an effort to provide the applicant with a complete and comprehensive notice, and allow them to fix any issues while they are working on the application.\n\nWhy doesn’t the Commission allow for auto-fill or copy/paste of certain sections throughout the application?\n\nThe Commission recently updated MassCIP to allow for certain fields (e.g. company name) of the application to be automatically populated.\n\nWhy do I need to have a letter from the non-profit or charity that I intend to donate to indicating they would accept my donation?\n\nA letter is needed because some non-profit or charitable entities, especially those that serve youth populations, are prohibited by law or contract from receiving funds from certain sources, such as firearms, tobacco, and alcohol. They may also prohibit donations from MEs, which would ultimately lead to an inability of a licensee to comply with specific provisions of their Plan to Positively Impact Disproportionately Harmed People.\n\nWhy did the Commission reopen my application to ask me about the size, shape, and flavor of my proposed edibles?\n\nThe Commission’s regulations expressly prohibit the manufacture or sale of edible products that are in the shapes of humans, animals, or fruits, or that may bear a likeness to cartoons or other artistic renderings. The packaging and labeling of such products may also not resemble products that are typically marketed to minors. As a result, applicants are asked to confirm that the products they intend to manufacture would not violate these various restrictions.\n\nWhy aren’t Social Consumption and Delivery Licenses available?\n\nDuring its 2019 regulatory review, the Commission authorized a pilot program for a Social Consumption License and expects to start accepting license applications for adult-use cannabis delivery in the spring of 2020. A Delivery-Only License type will be offered exclusively for Certified Economic Empowerment Priority applicants, Social Equity Program participants, and Microbusinesses with a Delivery Endorsement from the Commission, for an initial period of two years. Delivery for adult-use cannabis consumers will be permitted in municipalities in which retail sales are permitted, delivery businesses are located, and those that notify the Commission that delivery is permitted within their borders. Please reference the Municipal Zoning Tracker for more information on individual municipalities.\n\nPlease note, however, that the Commission’s social consumption pilot program cannot begin without a change in state law that will first allow cities and towns to authorize social consumption in their communities.\n\nIs the “Delivery Only” license type the same as the “Marijuana Courier” license type?\n\nYes, the name for the Delivery Only license was changed to “Marijuana Courier” and is the same license type.\n\nIf I originally applied for, or was approved for a Delivery Only license, can I convert it to a Marijuana Delivery Operator license?\n\nNo. Even if you have previously applied for Pre-Certification or Licensure for Delivery Only (now Courier), you will have to start a new Pre-Certification application for the Marijuana Delivery Operator license.\n\nIf you previously applied to operate as a Delivery Only licensee, or were issued that license, your application or license will automatically convert to the Marijuana Courier license type.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Marijuana Courier, Marijuana Delivery Operator, and a Delivery Endorsement?\n\nThe Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator licenses are both stand-alone license types allowed to perform different operations. Marijuana Couriers are allowed to deliver marijuana and marijuana products to consumers and patients from a Marijuana Retail Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center. Delivery Operators are allowed to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from licensed Marijuana Cultivators and Marijuana Product Manufacturers and sell and deliver to consumers. Marijuana Couriers cannot store marijuana and marijuana products overnight whereas Marijuana Delivery Operators may securely store on its premises marijuana and marijuana products that have been purchased at wholesale for eventual resale to consumers.\n\nA Delivery Endorsement is expanded permission to perform delivery operations that is added to an existing license. It is like having a driver’s license for a car and then getting permission to operate a motorcycle and receiving a motorcycle endorsement. Currently, Delivery Endorsements are available only to Marijuana Microbusinesses with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants for a period of at least 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator licensee receives a notice to commence operations.\n\nWho can apply for a Delivery license?\n\nMarijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator licenses and Delivery Endorsements are limited, on an exclusive basis, to businesses controlled by, and with majority ownership comprised of, Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants for a period of at least 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator licensee receives a notice to commence operations.\n\nCan a Delivery applicant or licensee have, or obtain, a Marijuana Retailer license?\n\nYes.\n\nIndividuals and entities are limited to applying for and obtaining no more than two (2) delivery licenses. The limitation for delivery licenses is not tied to the amount an individual or entity can obtain for retail licenses—which remains at no more than three (3).\n\nWhat restrictions are in place to prevent retailers or third-party companies from controlling delivery businesses?\n\nIndividuals and entities can hold only a limited number of Marijuana Retailer and Delivery licensees.\n\nMarijuana Retailers, Delivery licensees, and Microbusinesses with Delivery Endorsements may work with Third-Party Technology Platform Providers which provide or host internet-based applications for the facilitation of ordering and delivering cannabis. All agreements between a Delivery licensee and a Third-Party Technology Platform Provider, however, shall be available for inspection and are subject to the control limitations under 935 CMR 500.050: Marijuana Establishments, including:\n\nA Third-Party Technology Platform Provider cannot be a licensee, or a Person or Entity with Direct or Indirect Control, as defined by 935 CMR 500.002: Fees, of a Delivery licensee.\n\nA contract between a Delivery licensee and a Third-Party Technology Platform Provider shall be negotiated and entered into on an arm’s length basis. A Delivery licensee may not accept any investment by a Third-Party Technology Platform Provider with which it has a contract.\n\nA Delivery licensee cannot share its profits of the sale of marijuana or marijuana products with a Third-Party Technology Platform Provider, or otherwise provide a percentage or portion of the sale of marijuana or marijuana products to the Third-Party Technology Platform Provider.\n\nWhat is the application process to apply for a Delivery license?\n\nFor an applicant to receive a Delivery license, they must complete two (2) applications that will occur in two (2) phases: Phase 1 – the pre-certification application, and Phase 2 – the provisional license application. All applicants will be required to complete both applications in phases. Phase 1 is completing the pre-certification application. Once you receive an approval letter stating you are pre-certified, you will be able to start and finish Phase 2 which is completing the provisional license application.\n\nAs a note, there are two separate pre-certification applications, one for each Delivery license type that have specific and distinct requirements. While an applicant can be pre-certified for both license types, they must be pre-certified for the license type they are applying for and cannot use another pre-certification in its place.\n\nWhat is required to be submitted as part of the pre-certification application?\n\nThe following is a list of application requirements for the pre-certification application:\n\nInformation about the business:\n\nLegal business name;\n\nTax identification number;\n\nContact information;\n\nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise information, if applicable; and\n\nCertified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicant and Social Equity Program Participant certification numbers (these numbers start with either “EE” or “SE”)\n\nInformation pertaining to Persons and Entities Having Direct or Indirect Control;\n\nBusiness interests in other jurisdictions, and within Massachusetts, of any Persons and Entities Having Direct or Indirect Control;\n\nBackground check and contact information for any Persons and Entities Having Direct or Indirect Control—background check authorization documents are not required until the provisional license application;\n\nUpload a business plan and a plan for obtaining limited liability insurance; and\n\nUpload operating policies and procedures that comply with the Commission’s regulations including the following:\n\nSecurity plan;\n\nTransportation plan;\n\nInventory plan;\n\nPlan to prevent diversion;\n\nStorage plan;\n\nDelivery plan;\n\nQuality control and testing;\n\nRecord-keeping procedures;\n\nMaintenance of financial records;\n\nQualifications and intended trainings for personnel;\n\nPlan to obtain marijuana and marijuana products (Marijuana Courier license type)\n\nPersonnel policies; and\n\nDispensing procedures (for Marijuana Delivery Operators).\n\nApplicants are encouraged to review the Commission’s Guidance on Licensure for further clarification on application requirements.\n\nWhat can I expect when my pre-certification application is deemed complete?\n\nWhen a pre-certification application is deemed complete, the application will move to the “Applications Deemed Complete” queue within the Massachusetts Cannabis Industry Portal (MassCIP). The applicant does not need to take any additional steps until notified by email from the Commission.\n\nWhen the applicant is approved for pre-certification, a notice (including a copy of the pre- certification application) will be sent to the business email on the application explaining next steps which will include starting the next phase of the application—the provisional license application.\n\nHow long is my pre-certification valid for?\n\nPre-certified applications are valid for 24 months from the date of the approval notice. Applicants must start the provisional license application within 24 months from when they were pre-certified; otherwise, a new pre-certification application will need to be completed and approved.\n\nWhat is required to be submitted as part of the provisional license application?\n\nThe following is a list of application requirements for the provisional license application:\n\nAmend or supplement any outdated information from what was submitted in the pre- certification application;\n\nDisclose the proposed location of the Delivery license and submit property interest documentation;\n\nDisclose capital resources along with supporting documentation;\n\nDisclose, if known, all current agreements between the applicant and Third-Party Technology Platform Providers (both Delivery license types) and Marijuana Retailers (for Marijuana Couriers only);\n\nSubmit additional documentation which includes the following:\n\nCertification of Host Community Agreement;\n\nCommunity Outreach Meeting attestations and documentation;\n\nPlan to remain compliant with local ordinances;\n\nPositive Impact Plan;\n\nDiversity Plan;\n\nBond or escrow account;\n\nBackground authorization forms;\n\nCertificates of good standing from the Department of Revenue, Secretary of the Commonwealth, and Department of Unemployment Assistance;\n\nWhite labeling and wholesale agreements, where applicable for Marijuana Delivery Operators; and\n\nA proposed timeline to become operational.\n\nWill I have to re-enter the information from the pre-certification application into the provisional license application?\n\nNo. When you start your provisional license application, the previously submitted information will transfer from your approved pre- certification application. If previously submitted information has changed or is outdated, you will need to update that information at the provisional license application stage. For example, you will need to add individuals newly associated with your application.\n\nWhat is the application fee for a Delivery license and when do I pay it?\n\nThe application fee for a Marijuana Delivery Operator or a Marijuana Courier license application is $1,500, however, license application fees are automatically waived ($0) for businesses controlled by and with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants.\n\nWhat are the license fees for a Marijuana Delivery Operator and Marijuana Courier license and when do I pay it?\n\nThe annual license fee is $5,000 for a Marijuana Courier and $10,000 for a Delivery Operator. However, the annual license fees for Delivery licensee businesses controlled by and with majority ownership comprised of Social Equity Program Participants and/or Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants are the following:\n\nFor the first year: $0\n\nFor the second year and every following year: $2,500 for a Marijuana Courier and $5,000 for a Delivery Operator license (50% reduction)\n\nWhat is the application process to apply for a Delivery Endorsement?\n\nLicensed Marijuana Microbusinesses may electronically submit a Delivery Endorsement application through MassCIP. This application process involves one (1) application instead of the two-part application process for Delivery licenses. Delivery Endorsements are only available to businesses controlled by and with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants for a period of 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator Licensee receives a notice to commence operations.\n\nWhat is required to be submitted as part of the Delivery Endorsement application?\n\nThe applicant will confirm certain business information. In addition to that confirmation, applicants for a Delivery Endorsement will have to submit the following information:\n\nPlan to remain compliant with local ordinances relating to delivery;\n\nDelivery plan;\n\nSecurity plan for delivery, and\n\nAgreements with Third-Party Technology Platform Providers.\n\nWhat is the application fee for a Delivery Endorsement and when do I pay it?\n\nGenerally, the application fee for a Delivery Endorsement is $500. This fee is paid prior to submission of the application.\n\nCurrently, while Delivery Endorsements are available only to Marijuana Microbusinesses controlled by and with a majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants during a 36-month exclusivity period, the application fee is waived ($0).\n\nWhat is the annual license fee for a Delivery Endorsement and when do I pay it?\n\nThe annual license fee for a Delivery Endorsement is $5,000. However, as Delivery Endorsements are available only to Marijuana Microbusinesses controlled by and with a majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants during an exclusivity period, the fee is reduced by 50% and is $2,500.\n\nAdditionally, because the endorsement is tied to the license, the fee is prorated based on the remaining time on the license. This fee is required to be paid upon approval by the Commission.\n\nWhere can I get more information about the application requirements or the licensing process?\n\nInformation about all license application requirements and the licensing process can be found in the Commission’s Guidance on Licensure. For best advice, the Commission recommends consulting a licensed attorney or knowledgeable industry professional for best guidance.\n\nWhat is a “Third-Party Technology Platform Provider?”\n\nA Third-Party Technology Platform Provider (Provider) is an individual or business that provides or hosts an internet-based application(s) developed for the facilitation of ordering and delivering marijuana, marijuana products and marijuana accessories and branded goods by a Marijuana Courier or Marijuana Delivery Operator or a business with a Delivery Endorsement to a consumer, patient, or caregiver.\n\nWhere a Delivery licensee contracts with a Provider, it must ensure that its goods are sold in compliance with the licensing requirements, for example, advertising and branding.\n\nA licensee that develops a proprietary application exclusively for its own use is not considered to be a Third-Party Technology Platform Provider.\n\nA Third-Party Technology Platform Provider may not be an investor in a Delivery licensee.\n\nCan a Marijuana Courier deliver adult and medical marijuana product? What about Marijuana Delivery Operators?\n\nYes, a Marijuana Courier may contract with Marijuana Retailers and/or Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MTCs) to deliver product to consumers, patients, or caregivers. Products from an MTC can be delivered to patients and caregivers.\n\nA Marijuana Delivery Operator may not acquire from an MTC or deliver medical-use marijuana to a patient or caregiver. A Marijuana Delivery Operator can only sell and deliver marijuana and marijuana products, and their own marijuana accessories and branded goods, directly to a consumer (a person who is 21 years of age or older).\n\nWhere do I apply for a Delivery license or Delivery Endorsement?\n\nApplications will be available electronically in MassCIP located here: https://www.massciportal.com/login-register. Businesses seeking a Marijuana Courier or Marijuana Delivery Operator license will be able to access the pre-certification application. Marijuana Microbusinesses seeking a Delivery Endorsement will be able to access the Delivery Endorsement application.\n\nWhich communities may receive deliveries? Why aren’t Marijuana Couriers or Marijuana Delivery Operators allowed to deliver to consumers in municipalities that have not allowed retail operations or opted in for delivery operations?\n\nThe law allows cities or towns, in some cases, to restrict certain Marijuana Establishments from operating within its borders. Considering this legal requirement, the Commission’s regulations allow delivery in only the following locations:\n\nThe city or town in which the Delivery licensee is located (the business location or place of business);\n\nAny city or town which allows for retail operations (even if a Marijuana Retailer is not operational there); and\n\nAny city or town that has notified the Commission that delivery is allowed within its borders.\n\nApplicants, licensees, and consumers can view which cities and towns have allowed delivery and retail operations by reviewing the Commission’s Municipal Zoning Tracker located here: MassCannabisControl.com/Municipal-Zoning-Tracker.\n\nCan a Microbusiness licensee located in a city or town that does not permit retail sales and has not “opted in” to allow for delivery obtain a Delivery Endorsement?\n\nNo, the city or town must either allow retail operations or “opt in” to allow delivery operations. A city or town can “opt in” after receiving notice from the Commission and stating that delivery may operate within its borders.\n\nApplicants, licensees, and consumers can view which cities or towns have allowed delivery and retail operations by reviewing the Commission’s Municipal Zoning Tracker located here: MassCannabisControl.com/Municipal-Zoning-Tracker.\n\nWhat defines the delivery business location? Is it where you house your vehicle(s)?\n\nFor Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator applicants and licensees, the business location is the location where vehicle(s) are housed, delivery orders are received, vehicles are dispatched from every day, and employees monitor delivery vehicles in transport through GPS and reporting requirements.\n\nThe location should be in a city or town that has allowed retail or delivery operations and is appropriately zoned. The location should have a building that allows for the “back office” operations of a Delivery license, where delivery orders are received, vehicles are dispatched from every day, and where employees will monitor delivery vehicles in transport through GPS and reporting requirements.\n\nAfter being pre-certified, Marijuana Courier and Marijuana Delivery Operator license applicants provide their location information in their provisional license applications.\n\nDoes a delivery business need to sign a Host Community Agreement (HCA) with every community in which its residents will receive a delivery?\n\nNo. However, all applicants must submit certification of an executed HCA with the city or town in which their business will be located.\n\nWill consumers pay the Marijuana Courier for the entire order or just for the delivery fee?\n\nIt is up to the Marijuana Courier and the Marijuana Retailer it contracts with to determine when and how the consumer pays. For the safety of the drivers and consumers, Marijuana Retailers and Marijuana Couriers may use platforms for the electronic payment of funds to minimize the amount of cash carried on a delivery vehicle, and store cash in a locked compartment.\n\nAre there limits on the number of Marijuana Establishments with which a Marijuana Courier can do business?\n\nNo. However, a Marijuana Courier is required to have an executed delivery agreement with the Marijuana Retailer or MTC prior to performing deliveries.\n\nCan Delivery licensees mix products from different Marijuana Retailers into a consumer’s individual order?\n\nYes, as long as the consumer’s individual order does not exceed the individual possession limits. A Marijuana Courier, Marijuana Delivery Operator, or a Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement can deliver only one (1) individual order per consumer, during each delivery. A Delivery licensee or a Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement cannot deliver to the same consumer at the same residence more than once each calendar day, regardless of the quantity of their individual order.\n\nMay a Marijuana Courier contract with a Marijuana Retailer to complete the pre-verification process for consumers who intend to place delivery orders? What are some of the pre-verification restrictions for Delivery licensees?\n\nYes.\n\nA Marijuana Courier is prohibited from performing a delivery to any consumer who has not established an account for delivery through pre-verification of the consumer’s identification by the Marijuana Retailer or Third-Party Technology Platform.\n\nA Marijuana Delivery Operator or Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement is prohibited from performing a delivery to any consumer who has not established an account for delivery through pre-verification of the consumer’s identification through Commission-approved electronic means.\n\nCan delivery companies use third-party applications or credit, debit, or ATM card transactions instead of cash payments for safety reasons?\n\nYes.\n\nAt what point can Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants liquidate their ownership over the Marijuana Courier or Delivery Operator license?\n\nAll Delivery licenses are available to businesses controlled by and with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants for an exclusive period of at least 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator licensee receives notice to commence operations. Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and/or Social Equity Program Participants must have, and maintain, control and majority ownership over this license type during the entire exclusivity period.\n\nDoes the licensee with which a Marijuana Courier contracts to obtain product for delivery need to be a Marijuana Retailer?\n\nYes, a Marijuana Courier can only contract with Marijuana Retailers and/or MTCs to deliver the Marijuana Retailers’ and/or MTCs’ marijuana and marijuana products to consumers, patients, or caregivers.\n\nCan a Marijuana Courier wholesale product from Marijuana Product Manufacturers and Marijuana Cultivators?\n\nNo.\n\nCan a Marijuana Delivery Operator wholesale product from Marijuana Product Manufacturers and Marijuana Cultivators?\n\nYes. A Marijuana Delivery Operator may contract with licensed Marijuana Cultivators, Marijuana Product Manufacturers, Microbusinesses, or Craft Marijuana Cooperatives to obtain wholesale products to sell and deliver directly to consumers.\n\nWhen does a background check and fingerprinting occur with a Marijuana Courier or Marijuana Delivery Operator license application?\n\nWhen applicants complete the provisional license application (the second application), applicants must submit background check authorization forms and update background check history events. After review and when deemed complete, Commission staff will notify applicants to submit the background check fee to a Commission vendor and complete the fingerprint examination. No background checks or fingerprinting is required in the pre-certification application, however, disclosure of background events will be reviewed.\n\nWho is eligible to apply for and invest in Delivery licenses?\n\nDelivery licenses are limited, on an exclusive basis, to businesses controlled by and with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants or Social Equity Program Participants for a period of at least 36 months from the date the first Delivery Operator licensee receives a notice to commence operations (the “exclusivity period”).\n\nOther individuals and entities may contribute capital resources.\n\nCan a Marijuana Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement deliver other Marijuana Establishments’ marijuana products?\n\nNo.\n\nCan an agent of a Marijuana Courier enter a Marijuana Retailer, with whom they have a delivery agreement, through an employee-only entrance to make a pickup without a registered agent badge for that particular Marijuana Retailer?\n\nYes, however, the Marijuana Retailer must follow visitor procedures.\n\nWill a Delivery licensee have to undergo an inspection once provisionally licensed?\n\nYes, Commission staff will provide the licensee a notice once provisionally licensed along with a request form for a Post-Provisional License Inspection (PPLI). This inspection will ensure your vehicle(s) and standard operating procedures, among other items, comply with the Commission’s regulations. After successfully completing the PPLI, the Delivery licensee moves to final license approval.\n\nCan a Marijuana Courier licensee perform other marijuana-related activities, such as packaging, repackaging, and/or preparing orders for delivery?\n\nNo.\n\nCan a Delivery licensee rent its delivery vehicle?\n\nNo, the licensee must either own its vehicle or lease it from a private party. The vehicle must be properly registered to the licensee as a commercial vehicle.\n\nCan a Delivery licensee deliver products other than marijuana (i.e., accessories, clothing, novelty, or promotional items)?\n\nYes, Marijuana Couriers can also deliver marijuana accessories and branded goods, either their own or the Marijuana Retailer’s.\n\nYes, Marijuana Delivery Operators can deliver their own marijuana accessories and branded goods.\n\nMarijuana accessories may not include branded goods.\n\nHow many registered agents must be in the vehicle when performing deliveries?\n\nTwo (2) registered agents must be in the delivery vehicle when performing home deliveries. At least one (1) registered agent must always remain in the vehicle.\n\nAre Marijuana Couriers allowed to deliver its own product?\n\nA Marijuana Courier can only deliver products sold by a Marijuana Retailer or MTC. Therefore, for a Marijuana Courier to deliver its own product, it would also need to hold a separate Marijuana Retailer or MTC license. Microbusinesses with Delivery Endorsements can deliver its own product to consumers.\n\nCan Marijuana Couriers “stack” deliveries within one trip?\n\nYes, Marijuana Courier licensees may obtain marijuana and marijuana products from multiple Marijuana Retailers and MTCs to deliver to consumers, patients, and caregivers. The maximum retail value of marijuana and marijuana product in the vehicle at one time is limited to $10,000. This $10,000 limit does not apply to marijuana accessories and branded goods.\n\nCan a person come to the delivery vehicle to pick up their order?\n\nNo, the Delivery licensee’s registered agent must deliver the product to the consumer’s residence, house, condominium, or apartment.\n\nWho can receive deliveries and how much can be delivered?\n\nConsumers who are 21 years of age or older may receive deliveries for adult-use marijuana and marijuana products. Consumers must be pre-verified before filling the order by providing the government-issued identification card that will be used at the time of delivery.\n\nAdditionally, consumers are limited to one (1) ounce of marijuana or its combined dry weight equivalent in marijuana concentrate or edible marijuana products per day. One (1) ounce of marijuana flower is considered equivalent to five (5) grams of active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in marijuana concentrate including, but not limited to, tinctures. One (1) ounce of marijuana flower is considered equivalent to 500 milligrams of active THC in edible marijuana products.\n\nWhat happens if there is a car accident or other emergency during a delivery?\n\nIn the case of an emergency stop during the delivery, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. The Marijuana Establishment agents in the vehicle must provide notice to the employer-licensee of the location of the stop, seek assistance, and employ best efforts to remain in contact with their employer.\n\nMarijuana Establishment agents shall report to the Commission and law enforcement authorities any vehicle accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable incidents that occur during transport, not more than 24 hours of such accidents, diversions, losses, or other reportable incidents.\n\nIf a motor vehicle accident renders the vehicle inoperable, the Licensee shall notify state and local law enforcement immediately so that marijuana products may be adequately secured.\n\nIf we are only transporting from retailer to consumer, why do we need a location?\n\nEvery business must provide a physical business location within a city or town under the law. For purposes of Delivery applicants and licensees, this will be the location where the vehicle(s) are housed, delivery orders are received, vehicles are dispatched from every day, and where employees will monitor delivery vehicles in transport through GPS and reporting requirements.\n\nCan my business office or location be mobile? Can I work out of a trailer or my delivery van?\n\nDelivery licensees must have a fixed business address where the licensee conducts business operations. This location must be approved by the city or town where it is situated.\n\nWhat will the Commission require for a location?\n\nIdentification of the proposed address for the license;\n\nDocumentation of a property interest in the proposed address by way of one of the following:\n\nClear legal title to the proposed site;\n\nAn option to purchase the proposed site;\n\nA legally enforceable agreement to give such title; or\n\nDocumentation from the owner evidencing permission to use the Premises.\n\nThe Commission has several requirements in the license application for a location of a Delivery licensee:\n\nDisclosure of the business’ address;\n\nDocuments showing property interest in the proposed address (for example, lease, title to the property, a binding letter of intent to use the property);\n\nHost Community Agreement;\n\nCommunity Outreach Documentation; and\n\nPlan to Remain Compliant with Local Ordinances.\n\nThe location should be in a city or town that allows marijuana retail or delivery operations and is appropriately zoned. The location should have a building that allows for the “back office” operations of a Delivery license from which delivery orders are received, vehicles are dispatched daily, and where employees will monitor delivery vehicles in transport through GPS and reporting requirements.\n\nCan an entity with a Marijuana Retailer location apply for a Delivery license? If so, does it need to have an additional location for the delivery business?\n\nYes, a Marijuana Retailer can apply for a Delivery license subject to the license caps and the exclusivity period.\n\nA licensee who has both a Marijuana Retailer and Delivery license is allowed to operate from the same facility, so long as the licensee is able to comply with the regulations for both license types.\n\nAre there any rules for where the vehicles need to be parked when they do not have marijuana in the vehicles?\n\nYes, the delivery vehicles may be parked overnight at the address identified as the licensee’s place of business or another location, provided that keeping the vehicle at the identified location complies with all general and special bylaws of that city or town.\n\nDoes a Delivery licensee have to use its own drivers, or can it use the Marijuana Retailer’s drivers? Is there an option to use a combination of both methods?\n\nThe drivers performing deliveries on behalf of a Delivery licensee must be active registered agents and employees of the Delivery licensee.\n\nWhy is general liability and product liability insurance coverage needed?\n\nThe Commission, in its regulations, require all vehicles used for delivery by a Delivery licensee or Marijuana Establishment with a Delivery Endorsement to carry liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit.\n\nMay a Marijuana Courier with an existing delivery agreement with a Marijuana Retailer (who also has a Cultivation or Product Manufacturing license) pick up finished product from the licensed cultivation or manufacturing facility if it is earmarked for that same licensee’s own retail facility?\n\nNo, all marijuana and marijuana product orders for delivery must be picked up at a Marijuana Retailer facility.\n\nCan a Social Equity Program Participant’s Microbusiness invest in other Social Equity Program Participants’ or Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants’ businesses?\n\nPersons and entities associated with the Microbusiness are prohibited from being a Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control for any other Marijuana Establishment except a Social Consumption Establishment. However, this does not prohibit certain investments, such as contributions of capital resources.\n\nWhat criteria will be used to determine whether the exclusivity period will be extended beyond 36 months?\n\nAt least eight (8) months before the end of the exclusivity period, the Commission will begin evaluating data to determine whether the goals of the exclusivity period have been met. The criteria for evaluation will include:\n\nOverall rates of participation in the regulated marijuana industry by people from communities that have previously been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement of the law;\n\nOverall rates of participation in the regulated Marijuana industry by people of color;\n\nLicenses granted to businesses with majority ownership comprised of Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants and Social Equity Program Participants;\n\nNumber of registered agents who are Social Equity Program Participants;\n\nNumber of Delivery licensees in operation and business performance relative to other Marijuana Establishments;\n\nFinancial feasibility of continued participation in the regulated marijuana industry by communities that have previously been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement of the law if exclusivity period ends; and\n\nAny other information the Commission determines relevant.\n\nCan seeds and clones be delivered?\n\nYes.\n\nCan a Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement also hold a Delivery license?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat is a transportation plan?\n\nAll applicants must demonstrate knowledge and compliance with standard operating procedures including a transportation plan. Some of these requirements include the need to have a properly registered vehicle, remaining within the Commonwealth when delivering and having randomized routes, GPS tracking, transportation logs, and requirements around manifests.\n\nDo the operating procedures need to be separated into sections, or can they be merged? For example, can the “plan to prevent diversion” be part of the “delivery plan” section?\n\nEach required plan must be uploaded as its own separate PDF and properly labeled; they cannot be merged.\n\nCan a Marijuana Courier store or warehouse marijuana or marijuana products?\n\nNo, the Marijuana Courier must return all undeliverable or refused marijuana and marijuana products to the originating Marijuana Retailer once all deliveries included on a manifest have been made. Marijuana and marijuana products cannot be held or warehoused by a Marijuana Courier overnight.\n\nWhen a Marijuana Courier has completed all deliveries for the day, and does not need to return marijuana and marijuana product to another Marijuana Establishment, can the delivery agent return the vehicle to the principal place of business or an off-site location?\n\nYes, the Marijuana Courier may allow its agents to return the delivery vehicle to the principal place of business or an off-site location if this location complies with local and special bylaws or ordinances. The delivery log required to be maintained should track the vehicle’s mileage 1) when the vehicle leaves the Marijuana Retailer, 2) each time it arrives at a consumer’s residence, and 3) when it returns to the Marijuana Retailer, principal place of business, or an off-site location as permitted. A notation should be made indicating the return trip was to this final location.\n\nDuring which hours is a Delivery licensee prohibited from performing deliveries?\n\nDeliveries shall not occur between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. unless explicitly allowed by a city or town’s bylaw or ordinance.\n\nHow does the local tax option apply to a transaction where both marijuana and non-marijuana products, such as marijuana accessories and branded goods, are sold?\n\nWhen marijuana and marijuana products are sold at retail, there is a calculation of the state sales tax, state excise tax, and if applicable, a local option tax imposed by cities or towns. For a Marijuana Retailer, Delivery Operator or Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement, the rate of the local tax option is set by the host community and calculated for retail sales of marijuana and marijuana products.\n\nRetail sales of non-marijuana products, such as accessories and branded goods are generally only subject to the state sales tax if they are separately identified on the receipt given to the purchaser at the time of the sale.\n\nIs the Marijuana Courier required to pay the taxes on marijuana and marijuana products delivered to consumers?\n\nNo. For marijuana and marijuana products, the Marijuana Retailer, not the Marijuana Courier, is required to pay the state excise tax, the state sales tax, and any applicable local option tax on the products delivered to consumers.\n\nHow should Marijuana Retailers, including Delivery Operator Licensees and Microbusinesses with a Delivery Endorsement, separately state transactions where marijuana is sold along with non-marijuana products, such as marijuana accessories branded goods?\n\nMarijuana Retailers, including Delivery Operator Licensees and Microbusinesses with a Delivery Endorsement, must separately identify the amount of the total sales price for sales of marijuana and marijuana products and for sales of other goods, e.g., accessories or branded goods, or services, on the purchaser’s receipt. If there is a sale of accessories and branded goods and these sales are identified separately, only the state sales tax needs to be calculated, not the state excise tax or local option tax. You should be aware that some branded goods, i.e., articles of clothing, may be exempt from the sales tax. If the sale of different goods are identified not separately on the purchaser’s receipt, all of these taxes will be calculated for the total sales price. For more information, see DOR’s Sales and Use Tax Guide.\n\nDOR, not the Commission, regulates taxation, so licensees are encouraged to review DOR’s guidance, or consult with DOR or their own counsel on how taxes are collected on particular goods and for a particular sale.\n\nWhat is a Marijuana Research Facility?\n\nA Marijuana Research Facility is a Marijuana Establishment (ME) licensed by the Cannabis Control Commission (Commission) that can conduct research involving marijuana for a wide array of purposes.\n\nDo you need to obtain a license from the Commission to become a Marijuana Research Facility?\n\nYes. Marijuana Research Facility licenses are available to any academic institution, nonprofit corporation, or domestic corporation or entity authorized to do business in the Commonwealth that is interested in either conducting research involving cannabis directly or permitting external researchers with an approved Research Permit to conduct research involving cannabis within approved facilities.\n\nDoes a Marijuana Research Facility need to obtain any other permissions from the Commission prior to performing research?\n\nYes. In addition to all applicable inspections of any building that will be used as the licensed premises of a Marijuana Research Facility and compliance checks for other requirements, the Commission must approve the entity’s relevant Research Permit application prior to the commencement of any research study.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Research License and a Research Permit?\n\nOnce an entity has been granted a Marijuana Research Facility license, it will then be required to obtain a Research Permit from the Commission. A Research Permit means a certificate from the Commission to conduct a specified research study over a specified and finite period.\n\nFor clarity, a Marijuana Research Facility license generally allows research to be performed at an identified location. The Research Permit identifies the type of research study to be performed at the licensed premises of a Marijuana Research Facility.\n\nWhat information needs to be submitted to the Commission to obtain a Marijuana Research Facility License?\n\nGenerally, all Marijuana Research Facility applicants will need to comply with the same application requirements for other MEs. Some requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nCertification of a Host Community Agreement;\n\nIdentification of a proposed location and property interest documentation (e.g. lease, binding permission to use the premises, title to the property, etc.);\n\nConduct a Community Outreach Meeting;\n\nList all Persons or Entities Having Direct or Indirect Control;\n\nList all capital contributors and upload any loan/management agreements;\n\nProvide background authorization forms for applicable persons;\n\nSupply and upload compliant summaries of plans, policies, and procedures for security, inventory, quality control and testing, storage, etc.; and\n\nSupply and upload a Diversity Plan and Plan to Positively Impact Disproportionately Harmed People (formerly called Positive Impact Plan).\n\nWhat information needs to be submitted to the Commission to obtain a Research Permit?\n\nAll Research Permit applicants will need to submit the following requirements that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe name and curriculum vitae (CV) of each investigator and sub-investigator, including the licensed physician serving as principal investigator who leads the research project and monitors animal/human subjects (if applicable);\n\nThe Institution Review Board (IRB) Institution utilized for ethics review of research involving human subjects (additional information below about IRBs), if applicable;\n\nThe Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) Institution utilized for ethics review of research involving animal subjects (additional information below about IACUCs), if applicable;\n\nInformation on the research project including the following: publication-ready summary of the research project to be conducted, along with a detailed research protocol, safety and disposal protocols, articulated goals of the research project, and start/end dates;\n\nA description of the project funding or resources that includes the sources of the funding and an attestation that the project is adequately funded or resourced;\n\nDetailed information about any human participants, if applicable;\n\nDetailed information about any animal participants, if applicable;\n\nThe quantity of marijuana or marijuana products anticipated to be needed over the duration of the research project;\n\nThe Independent Testing Laboratory where the marijuana or marijuana products will be tested; and\n\nThe name and license number (or application number) of the Marijuana Research Facility where the project will take place.\n\nWhat is the Commission’s review process for Research Permits?\n\nOnce the licensee or their external researchers submit a Research Permit application to the Commission, it will be reviewed by staff based on the order in which it was submitted. If more information is required, the applicant will receive a notice seeking further information so the Commission may complete its review.\n\nIt is pertinent that any research projects involving human subjects supply all necessary IRB details and any study involving animal subjects supplies all necessary Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) details to the Commission. These include: (1) name of institutional IRB and/or IACUC; (2) contact information for IRB and/or IACUC and lead contact at IRB and/or IACUC with whom the licensee will be working, and (3) current status of IRB and/or IACUC approval. Commission staff need to see final IRB approval before any research will be approved to commence.\n\nI have a Research Permit granted by the Commission and I am ready to begin my research project. Where do I acquire the cannabis to be used in the study?\n\nThere are three (3) ways for a Marijuana Research Facility licensee to obtain marijuana:\n\nIf the Marijuana Research Facility licensee is also licensed as a Marijuana Cultivator and/or Marijuana Product Manufacturer, it can obtain its own marijuana or marijuana products from those licenses;\n\nMarijuana or marijuana products can be sourced directly from an external Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, Marijuana Cultivator, Marijuana Product Manufacturer, Marijuana Microbusiness, or Craft Marijuana Cooperative licensed by the Commission; or\n\nIf the cultivation or product manufacturing of marijuana or marijuana products is the subject of the research project, and the approved Research Permit allows it, the licensee may cultivate and/or produce marijuana or marijuana products if it first executes an agreement to do so in conjunction with another licensee authorized to perform those activities. This does not allow for home grown marijuana. All activities must take place at a licensed facility.\n\nMy research project involves human subjects. Are there any additional special requirements that are involved in these types of studies?\n\nYes. During the research project, all marijuana or marijuana products used in research and consumed by human subjects must comply with the following:\n\nBe adequately described in the Informed Consent Form;\n\nTested in accordance with 935 CMR 500.160 prior to consumption by human subjects; and\n\nRecorded in the Commission’s seed-to-sale tracking system, Metrc.\n\nPlease note the following requirements for human or animal participants:\n\nIRB approval of the project before a Research Permit is granted (applicable to human subject-involved research);\n\nOne or more licensed physicians in good standing must monitor the participants (applicable to human subject-involved research);\n\nOther than a survey-only research project, human participants in research conducted by a Marijuana Research Facility licensee where consumption of Marijuana or Marijuana Products is a component must reside in the Commonwealth;\n\nAny research project with human subjects are participants must identify the (1) name of IRB; (2) contact information for IRB and study IRB contact, and (3) current status of IRB approval. Approved Research Permits will need IRB approval before research may commence;\n\nThe number, ages, and demographic of the participants;\n\nThe number of Registered Qualified Patients (if any);\n\n“Vulnerable” cohorts (pregnant/breastfeeding women, minors, disabled veterans, etc.) and applicable safety precautions for these cohorts;\n\nA copy of each individual’s Informed Consent Form or Waiver of Consent;\n\nDocumentation showing that the process of obtaining Informed Consent complied with the Research Licensee’s other IRB, institutional, industry, or professional standards;\n\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval of the project before a Research Permit is granted (specific to animal subjects research); and\n\nOne or more licensed veterinary doctors in good standing to monitor participants (applicable to animal subjects research).\n\nWhat do I need to do once my research project has concluded?\n\nOnce the research project concludes, the Marijuana Research Facility licensee or external researchers utilizing the Research Permit must provide a final synopsis of the project specific to the Commission and the work undertaken as it aligns with the Research Permit:\n\nNo peer review publication: If the licensee or researchers do not intend to publish their work in a peer review journal, all copies of all final reports, findings, or documentation regarding the outcomes of approved research projects receiving a Research Permit must be submitted to the Commission.\n\nPeer review publication: If the licensee or researchers intend to submit any part of their work to a peer review journal, it is acceptable to submit all papers, findings, and documentation to the Commission after it is accepted for publication.\n\nIs the information I send to the Commission after my study has concluded considered private?\n\nNo. Any records or documentation received by the Commission becomes a public record and may be disclosed pursuant to the Public Records Law, M.G.L. c. 66, § 10 and M.G.L. c. 4, § 7, cl. 26, or other compulsory legal process, or at the Commission’s discretion.\n\nAs with all communication with the Commission, you should consider any conversations you have with us, or any material you provide to us, to be subject to a public records request or other compulsory legal process.\n\nOther types of Marijuana Establishments require inspections by the Commission. Can Marijuana Research Facility licensees also be inspected at any time?\n\nYes. The Commission, or its representatives, may conduct announced or unannounced inspections at any time. Additionally, Marijuana Research Facility licensees can expect an inspection after provisional licensure and final licensure as part of the regular licensing application process.\n\nDoes a business need to have a Research License prior to applying for a Research Permit?\n\nNo. However, Research Permit applicants are encouraged to wait to submit all necessary information for their research projects until a business has obtained all the necessary approvals to be a fully operational Marijuana Research Facility.\n\nAre there any limitations on ownership or control relating to the Marijuana Research Facility licenses?\n\nYes. An entity is limited to holding no more than three (3) Marijuana Research Facility licenses. Additionally, a Marijuana Research Facility licensee may hold or obtain other licenses for Marijuana Cultivation, Marijuana Product Manufacturing, and Marijuana Retail, for example.\n\nCan my business obtain a Marijuana Research Facility license if it, or the people/entities with ownership or control over it, have interests in other licenses?\n\nYes, subject to the ownership and control limits highlighted above. However, a Marijuana Research Facility licensee cannot be, or have financial interest in, an Independent Testing Laboratory license.\n\nAre Research Permits only available to Marijuana Research Facility licensees or license applicants?\n\nNo. Research Permits are separate from Marijuana Research Facility licenses. However, in order for a Marijuana Research Facility licensee to conduct research, it must first obtain a Research Permit.\n\nWhat are the application and license fees associated with a Marijuana Research Facility license?\n\nThe Marijuana Research Facility application fee is $300 and annual license fee is $1,000. Please note all applicable application and license fee waivers for Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants, Social Equity Program Participants, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises apply.\n\nAre there any costs associated with a Research Permit?\n\nThe Research Permit application fee is $1,000 and annual permit fee is $1,000. Please note that all applicable application and permit fee waivers for Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants, Social Equity Program Participants, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises apply.\n\nCan a Marijuana Research Facility Licensee hold more than one Research Permit?\n\nYes. However, a Marijuana Research Facility licensee with more than one (1) Research Permit must physically separate all marijuana or marijuana products used in one research project from another to ensure a clear boundary between projects.\n\nCan Marijuana Research Facility licensees work with other Marijuana Research Facilities?\n\nYes. One or more Marijuana Research Facility licensees may enter into agreements to conduct research jointly on an identified research project, provided that research activities authorized under the Research Permit must be conducted at only one (1) identified licensed Marijuana Research Facility. The Marijuana Research Facility licensee must disclose to the Commission all contracts or agreements with other Marijuana Research Facility licensees in furtherance of a research project.\n\nWill I need to renew my Marijuana Research Facility license?\n\nYes. Like all Marijuana Establishments, the Marijuana Research Facility license will expire one year after the date of issuance of the provisional license and annually thereafter. The licensee is required to complete a renewal application no later than 60 calendar days prior to the expiration date.\n\nWill I need to renew my Research Permit?\n\nYes. The Research Permit will be renewed at least annually, or sooner depending on the nature and duration of the approved research project.\n\nI applied for a Marijuana Research Facility license some time ago. What can I expect?\n\nCommission staff will review all previously submitted Marijuana Research Facility license applications in the order in which they were originally received.\n\nStaff will notify the applicant by email if more information is required. Once staff find the application complies with Commission regulations, background checks and municipal notification will occur. Once the Commission has received all required reports and responses, the application will be recommended for provisional licensure.\n\nIs there a difference between applying for a Marijuana Research Facility license and any other Marijuana Establishment?\n\nNo, with one exception. A research compliance plan will be required by Marijuana Research Facility applicants to demonstrate their comprehension of and compliance with the operational requirements for the license.\n\nIs a Marijuana Research Facility licensee required to comply with the same requirements as other Marijuana Establishments (e.g. security, storage, inventory, and other requirements)?\n\nYes. All Marijuana Research Facility applicants are encouraged to review the Commission’s Guidance on Licensure and regulations before starting a license application to comply with all requirements for licensure.\n\nCan a Marijuana Research Facility licensee transport marijuana?\n\nYes. A Marijuana Research Facility licensee must comply with all transportation requirements relating to its vehicles, agents, storage, and security, among other requirements.

Upon renewal, the agent registration is then valid for a three (3) year period and will be required to be renewed triennially going forward.\n\nWhat is an IRB?\n\nAn “Institutional Review Board” or “IRB” is a specifically constituted administrative body designated by a Marijuana Research Facility licensee to review and oversee the design and methods of a research project, and where human or animal subjects are a component of the research, to protect the rights and welfare of those recruited to participate.\n\nWhat is Informed Consent?\n\nInformed Consent means the consent obtained by a Marijuana Research Facility licensee from potential participants in a research project that also explains the risks and potential benefits of the study, and the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved. All marijuana or marijuana products used in research and consumed by human or animal subjects must be adequately described in the Informed Consent Form.\n\nWhat is an IACUC?\n\nAn “Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee” or “IACUC” is an administrative body designated by a Marijuana Research Facility licensee to review and oversee the design and methods of a research project and, where vertebrae animal subjects are a component of the research, to protect the rights and welfare of animals in research and testing.\n\nWhat is a Waiver of Consent?\n\nWaiver of Consent means the document signed by potential participants, or the legal guardians of potential participants, that waives one or more elements of consent.\n\nAre the human subjects of a research study required to be 21 years of age or older?\n\nYes, unless the subject is a currently a Registered Qualifying Patient registered by the Commission and under medical supervision.\n\nCan a Marijuana Research Facility sell its marijuana to other licensees?\n\nNo.\n\nCan subjects of a research study consume marijuana?\n\nYes, however, a Marijuana Research Facility licensee may only allow consumption of marijuana on its premises by a study participant if it is part of a permitted research project; otherwise the consumption of marijuana or marijuana products is not allowed.\n\nWhat is a Marijuana Research Facility licensee required to do with marijuana once its research, or the need for the marijuana, is over?\n\nAll unused marijuana and marijuana products must be recorded as waste in the Commission’s seed-to-sale system once the research project is done. Unused marijuana cannot be sold or transferred to other Marijuana Establishments or Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers. All waste must be disposed in accordance with 935 CMR 500.105(12).\n\nCan a Research Licensee be colocated with another Marijuana Establishment and/or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center?\n\nYes, if the Marijuana Research Facility and the collocated Marijuana Establishment or Medical Marijuana Treatment Center are commonly owned and clearly physically separated.\n\nAre there limitations on how a Marijuana Research Facility licensee or Research Permit holder can advertise for a particular study?\n\nAll licensees, including those with Marijuana Research Facility licenses and Research Permits, are required to comply with all advertising requirements.\n\nAdvertising means a form of marketing communication that employs a sponsored, non-personal message to sell or promote a Marijuana Establishment’s Brand Name, Marijuana Establishment Branded Good, service, product, or idea.\n\nPlease see 935 CMR 500.105(4) for additional information.\n\nDoes the Commission vote on Marijuana Research Facility licenses and Research Permits at its public meetings?\n\nAll licenses, including a Marijuana Research Facility license, will be approved by the Commission at a public meeting. The Commission’s Executive Director approves research permits and they do not require a vote of the Commission prior to issuance.\n\nAs the Commission continues to implement regulatory changes that were promulgated in October 2023, information contained on these webpages may require updates and/or verification by applicants and licensees in order to maintain compliance. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nWhen do Social Equity Program (SEP) benefits become available to Participants?\n\nWith the exception of live or in-person training and technical assistance, all program benefits are available immediately upon Participants’ acceptance into the SEP.\n\nWhen is the application deadline to apply for Cohort IV of the SEP?\n\nThe application period for Cohort IV closed on April 30th, 2024.\n\nWhere do I apply for the Social Equity Program?\n\nInterested applicants must first create an account in the Commission’s online Massachusetts Cannabis Industry Portal (MassCIP) to start an application for the SEP. General tutorials to help navigate MassCIP are available here.\n\nWhat are the new income restrictions required to be eligible to apply under Qualification 1 [1]?\n\nUnder qualification 1, to be eligible for the program, you must reside in an Area of Disproportionate Impact (ADI) for five of the past 10 years and your income may not exceed 400% of the Area Media Income (AMI) of your municipality of residence, based on ADIs.\n\nAMI is the midpoint of a region’s income. Please use the table below to identify what 400% AMI is in your city or town:\n\n400% Area Median Income Limits (as of 2021) Abington $425,620 Monson $193,000 Amherst $244,508 New Bedford $202,324 Boston $326,976 North Adams $194,300 Braintree $459,664 Pittsfield $238,088 Brockton $272,268 Quincy $340,164 Chelsea $259,128 Randolph $351,476 Fall River $198,452 Revere $292,164 Fitchburg $241,864 Southbridge $201,656 Greenfield $208,844 Spencer $194,584 Haverhill $300,520 Springfield $173,232 Holyoke $180,180 Taunton $267,148 Lawrence $190,168 Walpole $389,376 Lowell $257,956 Wareham $197,440 Lynn $255,688 West Springfield $240,092 Mansfield $350,724 Worcester $226,984\n\nWhat are the benefits of the Social Equity Program?\n\nSEP Participants gain access to training and technical assistance as part of their cohort, as well as a library of course materials from previous cohorts. Additionally, on an immediate and ongoing basis, they may utilize additional benefits such as:\n\nAccess to a pre-certification application that provides applicants with preliminary application status which indicates their suitability for the corresponding license types;\n\nAccess to exclusive pro-bono/ discounted wrap-around services, including but not limited to lawyers, Human Resource Professionals, Accountants and more; as well as resources, events, and job opportunities offered to the Commission via the Equity Involvement Form;\n\nPriority licensing review; and\n\nExpedited review if SEP Participants maintain at least 10% ownership in the business.\n\nIf you, by yourself or with other SEP Participants and/or Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants, control and maintain majority ownership (which is 51% or more of the business) in a licensee, the following fee waivers are available:\n\nWaived application fees (this waiver does not include the costs associated with background checks);\n\nWaived seed-to-sale METRC monthly program fees (this waiver does not include other costs associated with the seed-to-sale tracking system, specifically the fees for plant and package tags);\n\nExclusive access to Delivery Licenses, including Marijuana Courier Marijuana Delivery Operator, and Microbusinesses with Delivery Endorsements, for at least a three-year period (April 1, 2022-April 1, 2025);\n\nOnce available, exclusive access to Social Consumption licenses for at least a three-year period; and\n\nFifty percent (50%) off the annual license fees.\n\nWhat should SEP Participants do if they paid certain fees before qualifying for program benefits?\n\nSEP Participants who have paid certain fees prior to qualifying for program benefits should email Equity@CCCMass.com with details relative to what was paid. Participants who have paid fees before qualifying for the SEP program cannot seek reimbursement for those fees.\n\nWhen will the Delivery and Social Consumption applications become available?\n\nIn 2019, the Commission issued regulations for three Delivery license types and a pilot program for a Social Consumption license.\n\nAll Delivery license applications are currently open and available to qualified applicants. The Marijuana Courier license, Marijuana Delivery Operator license, and Microbusiness license with a Delivery Endorsement are offered exclusively to Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants (EEAs) and SEP Participants for an initial period of three years (April 1, 2022-April 1, 2025).\n\nWhile the Commission has established Social Consumption licenses, the application for such businesses is not available yet. The pilot program was not able to begin without a change in state law relative to municipalities’ ability to opt-in to hosting this license type. In August 2022, the State Legislature approved Chapter 180 of the Acts of 2022, which allows cities and towns to approve Social Consumption Marijuana Establishments within their borders. The law went into effect November 9, 2022, and the Commission has one year to promulgate updated regulations in order to implement the new law.\n\nI have completed SEP training and technical assistance as a prior cohort participant. Will I have access to updated resources as the program progresses with new cohorts and relevant laws and regulations change?\n\nYes. Current and future SEP Participants will always have access to SEP curricula as well as all updated resources and material as the program evolves. For example, the Commission developed delivery course work and an Advanced Core Curriculum, which were taught it for the first-time during Cohort III. In essence, all approved Participants will always be a part of the SEP. The Commission currently utilizes an online learning management system, TalentLMS, to streamline remote programming. All Participants will continue to have ongoing access to materials via TalentLMS.\n\nWhat is the Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund?\n\nThe Legislature, not the Commission, has the authority to create laws and establish funds. Following the enactment of Chapter 180 of the Acts of 2022: An Act Relative to Equity in the Cannabis Industry, the Executive Office of Economic Development (EOED) established a Cannabis Social Equity Trust Fund. This fund will distribute grants and loans, including no-interest loans, and forgivable loans, to only approved SEP Participants and approved EEAs.\n\nThe fund is administered by the EOED in consultation with the Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board. Members of the Advisory Board are appointed by the state Governor, Attorney General and Treasurer and consist of individuals with experience advocating on behalf of communities that have been disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition and enforcement. EOED is responsible for the selection of recipients, grant or loan values, and conditions for such grants or loans. If you wish to learn more information about the Social Equity Trust Fund please visit Cannabis Social Equity Advisory Board | Mass.gov for the latest details.\n\nCan the Commission work one-on-one with us to prepare our Licensing applications?\n\nNo. The Commission is a regulatory agency responsible for reviewing license applications and determining whether Marijuana Establishments and Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers are compliant with the adult-use (935 CMR 500.00) and medical-use (935 CMR 501.000) cannabis regulations. The Commission’s role as a regulatory agency prevents staff from providing one-on-one guidance for how to write an application for any applicant, regardless of their status.\n\nWhile the Commission is prohibited from providing one-on-one consultation, it can and does provide clarification on licensing requirements and interprets regulations via guidance documents. A guidance document for the licensing process can be found here.\n\nCan the Commission help applicants fill out their SEP application?\n\nYes, since the SEP is not a license type, the Commission is able to assist constituents with their applications for the program. Individuals may sign up for the SEP’s mailing list here for details about how the Equity Programming and Community Outreach team can assist.\n\nDo Participants need to recertify with the SEP on an annual basis?\n\nNo, once Participants are accepted into the SEP, they are eligible for all benefits for perpetuity and do not need to recertify as Participants.\n\nCan multiple SEP Participants join together to make up the required majority ownership in a delivery company, to receive the Expedited Review and fee waiver benefits?\n\nYes, so long as the owners who are SEP Participants and/or EEAs hold a combined majority ownership (51% or more) and are listed as Persons with Direct or Indirect Control on the license application.\n\nFor licenses other than Marijuana Courier, Marijuana Delivery Operator, Microbusiness with a Delivery Endorsement, or Social Consumption, SEP Participants can join together on a license application and receive expedited review by the Commission if they have a combined 10% or more of equity in the business and are listed as Persons with Direct or Indirect Control. Alternatively, SEP Participants can also join with combined majority ownership to receive fee waiver benefits.\n\nCan multiple SEP Participants join together to make up the required majority ownership in a company to be verified as a Social Equity Business?\n\nYes, so long as the owners who are SEP Participants and/or EEAs hold a combined majority ownership (51% or more) and are listed as Persons with Direct or Indirect Control on the license application.\n\nIf there has been a material change of circumstances after the submission of an application or received certification, the Social Equity Business applicant shall revise this information and attest in a form and manner determined by the Commission. The applicant shall also notify the Host Community of a material change in its application or status as a Social Equity Business, as applicable.\n\nCan SEP Participants receive training within all tracks and/or take all courses offered by the SEP?\n\nInitially, SEP Participants will be placed into program tracks based on the preference that they choose during the application process; however, over the long-term, they have the option to enroll in whichever tracks they are interested in pursuing. The Commission understands that SEP Participants’ interests and goals may shift during programming. Within the Entrepreneur track, SEP Participants are also welcome to pursue all four sub-tracks (Retail, Product Manufacturing, Delivery, and Cultivation). SEP Participants should email Equity@CCCMass.com to request to be added to additional tracks.\n\nDo I need to be registered to do business in Massachusetts and have a location prior to receiving a license from the Commonwealth?\n\nYes, all license applicants must be registered to do business in the Commonwealth prior to applying with the Commission. For more information regarding registering your business, please contact the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s Corporations Division. License applicants must also have a location where the business will be sited prior to receiving a license from the Commission. During the pre-certification process that is exclusively available to SEP and EEA license applicants, a location is not required.\n\nDo I need a lawyer to enter the marijuana industry? Does my business need a lawyer?\n\nAny license applicant is strongly encouraged to seek legal guidance or the advice of a professional consultant who specializes in business, compliance, and finance. However, SEP applicants are not required to retain a lawyer to apply for the program. As regulators, the Commission cannot recommend advisors for SEP applicants, however, SEP applicants should take steps to ensure they are receiving advice from a knowledgeable, competent professional.\n\nIf I submit a license application to the Commission, how long will it take for my business to open? Is there a checklist my business can follow once we receive our provisional license?\n\nThe Commission cannot offer a singular timeframe for how long it will take applicants to complete the licensing process as it depends on many factors. In general, all licensees must meet the requirements of 935 CMR 500.000: Adult Use of Marijuana or 935 CMR 501.000: Medical Use of Marijuana in order to open.\n\nOnce licensed, the business is responsible for requesting an inspection from the Commission. Following the provisional license notice issued by the Commission, there is an inspection request form outlining certain items that the licensee must certify as part of their inspection request. During the inspection phase, any deficiencies in compliance need to be addressed before the business can move on to the next stages of the licensing process, including final licensure and commencing operations. More information about Massachusetts’ licensing process is available in the Guidance on Licensure.\n\nFor best advice on complying with state laws and regulations, the Commission recommends working with a licensed attorney.\n\nIf I need to reopen my Marijuana Establishment application, will I lose my place in line?\n\nIf an SEP Participant needs to reopen their license application, they will maintain their Expedited Review status and re-enter the Commission’s queue for review based on when the application was originally submitted. Please note: the Commission must review any Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MTC) or EEA priority application in the licensing queue first—prior to Expedited Review applications—in accordance with state law.\n\nI am interested in Certified Economic Empowerment Priority Applicant (EEA) status. How can I apply?\n\nState law required the Commission to certify EEA status over a one-time period during the spring of 2018. As such, the Commission can no longer accept applications for individuals or businesses to be certified as EEAs. However, the Commission has extended Expedited Review status to SEP Participants and businesses that are certified as Minority-Owned, Woman-Owned, and Veteran-Owned by the Commonwealth’s Supplier Diversity Office (SDO). For further guidance on becoming certified, click here. Once certified, license applicants may submit to the Commission the Expedited Review Affidavit, located here.\n\nWhat is suitability? Could I be prevented from owning or working for an ME or MTC?\n\nThe Commission conducts background checks on all people and businesses listed on a license application to ensure they meet the Commission’s suitability standards. These standards can be found in 935 CMR 500.800 through 500.803 or 935 CMR 501.800 through 501.803. Past criminal convictions may not necessarily disqualify someone from owning or working for an ME or MTC. However, to obtain the best advice about a personal situation, the Commission recommends applicants consult a licensed attorney. If an applicant has received notice of an adverse suitability recommendation, they may request an informal hearing before the Suitability Review Committee, which is made up of Commission staff members.\n\nAdditionally, before the ME submits an agent registration application to the Commission, the ME or MTC must perform a background check on the prospective employee and disclose certain background information. The suitability standards for agents can be found under 935 CMR 500.802 or 935 CMR 501.802. The Commission reviews all background check reports for Registered Agents who work at a licensed ME or MTC during announced and unannounced inspections.\n\nThe Commission conducts background checks on all people and businesses listed on a license application to ensure they meet certain suitability standards. These standards can be found under adult-use regulations 935 CMR 500.800 and 500.801 (Table A), or medical regulations 935 CMR 501.800 and 501.801 (Table A).\n\nFor license applicants, one general restriction to be aware of is that no person or entity must have been convicted of a felony (excluding any convictions involving marijuana).\n\nPlease note: individuals whose SEP applications are approved in the Massachusetts Cannabis Industry Portal (MassCIP) can take a pre-screening survey, answer background check questions, and get an automatic response about potential suitability issues that may arise during the licensing process based on information they provide. The survey is available in MassCIP and is called “Social Equity Program Suitability Pre-Screening”.\n\nFor individuals who want to participate and work in the industry as Registered Agents, rather than own a license, the Commission has different suitability standards. In most cases, if you have marijuana convictions in your past—unless it involved distribution of controlled substances to a minor— it will not prevent you from working at a marijuana business. However, for best advice on your personal situation, consult a licensed attorney.\n\nYou can find those standards in the following places depending on what type of facility you would like to work at:\n\n935 CMR 500.802 Adult-Use Regulations\n\nTable B (Retail, Delivery, Social Consumption, and Transportation Agents)\n\nTable C (Product Manufacturing Agents)\n\nTable D (Cultivation Agents)\n\n935 CMR 500.803 Adult-Use Regulations\n\nTable E (Laboratory Agents)\n\n935 CMR 501.802 Medical-Use Regulations\n\nTable B (Medical Marijuana Treatment Center Agents)\n\nFollowing a 2022 change in state law (see c. 180 of the Acts of 2022, An Act Relative to Equity in the Cannabis Industry), past criminal offenses and convictions will not prevent individuals from working as agents in the adult- or medical-use industry with limited exceptions. Certain criminal offenses and convictions will still prevent individuals from being Laboratory Agents, while distribution of a controlled substance, including marijuana, to a minor will prevent any individual from being any type of agent.\n\nIs there any way to appeal a suitability issue that comes up during the licensing or agent registration process?\n\nSuitability issues that arise during the Commission’s licensing or agent registration processes will be reviewed and addressed specifically with the person who is subject to the issue. If an applicant has received notice of an adverse suitability recommendation, they may request an informal hearing before the agency’s Suitability Review Committee.\n\nThis is an informal process where you can talk to a panel of Commission staff members and provide more information or context around the event that raised the suitability issue. You can explain why you should be found suitable if a potential issue is identified. In some cases, mitigating factors may be used to rebut the potential suitability issue. Mitigating factors could include: time since the offense, number of offenses, sentence imposed, age at the time of offense, and whether the offense was committed in association with dependence on drugs or alcohol from which the person has since recovered. After hearing from you, the Committee makes a recommendation to the Executive Director who then makes a determination about your suitability.\n\nUltimately, if you learn that your background prevents you from owning a license, or working in a plant-touching role at an ME or MTC, there are plenty of other avenues available to reap the benefits of this industry. SEP is designed to provide different pathways to participating in the legal cannabis industry, including as an outside contractor through the ancillary track.\n\nWhat is Metrc? How much do Metrc plant tags cost?\n\nMetrc is the Commission’s third-party seed-to-sale tracking software of record through which all licensees are required to document movement of marijuana and marijuana product throughout the supply chain. The monthly Metrc program fee is waived for license applicants with majority ownership comprised of EEA and/or SEP Participants, who are also listed as Persons with Direct or Indirect Control on the application.\n\nFor more information about Metrc and plant tag prices, please visit the Massachusetts homepage of their website or contact them directly. SEP Participants can also find more information regarding Metrc tracking by reviewing the Commission’s guidance document here.\n\nWhat is the total amount of plants I can cultivate per tier?\n\nThe Commission does not regulate how many plants Marijuana Cultivators, Microbusinesses, or Craft Marijuana Cooperatives may cultivate. Growers may cultivate an amount of canopy equal to the maximum square footage allowed by the tier under their license. Canopy is a defined area where flowering2 and/or vegetative plants3 larger than eight inches tall and eight inches wide at any point in time, are maintained. The Commission’s cultivation tiers are available for review here."
