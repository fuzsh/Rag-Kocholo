Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Board shall not, on or after January 1, 2024, issue any additional medical cannabis establishment licenses or renew a medical cannabis establishment license pursuant to NRS 678B.210.\n\n2. The Board may, on or after January 1, 2024:\n\n(a) Issue a medical cannabis establishment license to an applicant pursuant to NRS 678B.210 if the proposed medical cannabis establishment will be located in a local governmental jurisdiction that is a covered jurisdiction.\n\n(b) Renew the medical cannabis establishment license of a medical cannabis establishment pursuant to NRS 678B.210 so long as the local governmental jurisdiction in which the medical cannabis establishment is located is a covered jurisdiction.\n\n3.

If the Board determines that the applicant would have been eligible to renew the medical cannabis establishment license which has expired, the Board shall issue to the applicant an adult-use cannabis establishment license of the same type.\n\n6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, an adult-use cannabis establishment license issued by the Board pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be an adult-use cannabis establishment license issued by the Board pursuant to NRS 678B.250.\n\n7.

The Board:\n\n(a) Shall not issue medical cannabis establishment licenses for medical cannabis dispensaries in such a quantity as to cause the existence within the applicable county of more than one medical cannabis dispensary for every 10 pharmacies that have been licensed in the county pursuant to chapter 639 of NRS. The Board may issue medical cannabis establishment licenses for medical cannabis dispensaries in excess of the ratio otherwise allowed pursuant to this paragraph if doing so is necessary to ensure that the Board issues at least one medical cannabis establishment license in each county of this State and, pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 1, each incorporated city of this State in which the Board has approved an application for such an establishment to operate.\n\n(b) Shall, for any county for which no applicants qualify pursuant to NRS 678B.210, within 2 months after the end of the period during which the Board accepts applications pursuant to NRS 678B.300, reallocate the licenses provided for that county pursuant to subsection 1 to the other counties specified in subsection 1 in the same proportion as provided in subsection 1.\n\n3.

The Board shall adopt regulations setting forth the requirements for granting such a request.\n\n2. To prevent monopolistic practices, the Board shall ensure, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more, that it does not issue, to any one person, group of persons or entity, the greater of:\n\n(a) One medical cannabis establishment license; or\n\n(b) More than 10 percent of the medical cannabis establishment licenses otherwise allocable in the county.\n\n3.
