        "text": "Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) are connective tissue disorders that cause joint hypermobility, instability, injury, and pain. Other problems such as fatigue, headaches, GI problems, and autonomic dysfunction are often seen as part of HSD.\n\nWhat is hypermobility?\n\nJoint hypermobility means that a person’s joints have a greater range of motion than is expected or normal.\n\nMost babies and children are naturally very flexible. Many people become less flexible as they grow, but hypermobility continues into adulthood for some, up to about 20% of people. Being “flexible,” “bendy,” or “double-jointed” is not usually a problem, and for some, like dancers or gymnasts, it is an advantage. Hypermobility that does not cause pain or other symptoms is referred to as “asymptomatic joint hypermobility” and does not need to be treated.\n\nThe problem occurs when joints are not just hypermobile but are also unstable. Joint instability occurs when the bones of a joint aren’t held in place securely. This can lead to joint subluxations, dislocations, sprains, and other injuries. Joint instability can cause both acute and chronic pain and interfere with daily life.\n\nJoint hypermobility and/or instability may be a person’s only problem. It can also occur as part of a known syndrome, such as types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), Marfan syndrome, or Down syndrome. The hypermobility spectrum disorders occur when a person has symptomatic joint hypermobility that cannot be explained by other conditions. A person with HSD may have joint instability as their only concern or may have other medical issues as well.\n\nWhat is a disorder?\n\nA medical disorder is defined as an illness or condition that disrupts normal physical or mental functions. If joint hypermobility causes problems that disrupt normal function, it is a disorder. If joint hypermobility isn’t causing any issues or pain, it is not considered to be a disorder.\n\nWhat is a spectrum disorder?\n\nA spectrum disorder refers to a condition that has wide variation in both the type and severity of symptoms people experience. For example, people with HSD may have mild or severe joint involvement. They may also experience one, two, or many other symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, constipation, or headaches, and any of these problems may be mild or severe.\n\nHow common is HSD?\n\nWe do not currently know the true prevalence of HSD. It is believed to be a common condition. (But unfortunately, it is not yet commonly diagnosed and treated!)\n\nHow is HSD managed?\n\nThe hypermobility spectrum disorders can cause a variety of symptoms in different areas of the body. Therefore, people with HSD may require multiple providers in different specialties to manage their care. There are no disease-specific treatments for HSD, so HSD is managed by managing each individual’s symptoms. People with HSD may have very different symptoms and respond differently to different management strategies. Each person should work with their care team to develop a care plan that meets their individual needs.\n\nHow is HSD diagnosed?\n\nHSD is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. In the process, clinicians need to rule out other conditions that can cause the same symptoms.\n\nTo be diagnosed with HSD, there should be evidence that the joint hypermobility is causing problems and it is not just an asymptomatic feature.\n\nThese problems include:\n\nJoint subluxations and/or dislocations\n\nJoint pain and loss of joint function\n\nJoint damage, such as cartilage tear\n\nEarly joint degeneration (which may, over time, lead to significant wear and tear called osteoarthritis)\n\nSoft tissue (ligament/tendon) damage and injury\n\nRecurrent, persistent, and/or chronic pain\n\nPoor proprioception (reduced awareness of body’s position/movement)\n\nOther problems that often occur in people with HSD include:\n\nFatigue\n\nAutonomic dysfunction\n\nHeadaches\n\nGastrointestinal problems\n\nAnxiety disorders"
