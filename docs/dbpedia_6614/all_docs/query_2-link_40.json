        "text": "Discover the latest social media statistics to refine your strategy, uncover new opportunities and stay ahead in 2024.\n\nReading time 8 minutes\n\nPublished on February 8, 2024\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSummary\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide, with an average person using 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nSocial media advertising spend is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024, with mobile generating $255.8 billion of this total by 2028.\n\nVideo content continues to be popular, with 44% of people preferring to learn about new products through short video content and 87% of marketers reporting increased sales from video marketing.\n\nIf you’re trying to improve your social media marketing strategy, understanding key industry statistics is the perfect starting point.\n\nSocial media statistics give you valuable insight into who your audience is, their interests and habits, as well as the state of the industry as a whole. This data helps you tailor your marketing strategies to boost engagement and ROI.\n\nStats can also help you benchmark your own performance within your industry and even uncover new opportunities.\n\nUse the social media marketing statistics below to guide your presence in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSocial media usage statistics\n\nIt’s no secret that we’re all glued to social media (my screen time data supports this). To get a better idea of how glued users are, let's look at some social media usage statistics.\n\nBelow is a quick snapshot of how social media demographics and usage are changing, which networks are winning and how hooked consumers are on social.\n\nIn 2024, there are estimated to be 5.17 billion total social media users worldwide.\n\nThe average person uses 6.7 different social networks per month.\n\nThe amount of time internet users spend on social media declined slightly to 143 minutes per day.\n\nTikTok is the fastest-growing platform with a staggering 100% user growth rate between 2020 and 2022. And between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023, TikTok's monthly active users grew 13%.\n\nThe number of social media users worldwide grew by 320 million people from January 2023 to January 2024.\n\nGrowth may seem slow, but that's due to the sheer number of people who already use social media. This means social media presents a huge opportunity for marketers and advertisers.\n\nHowever, with users spread across several platforms, it’s more important than ever for brands to take a multi-channel approach. Don't forget to leverage emerging platforms like TikTok to reach new audiences and stand out from the competition.\n\nSocial media advertising statistics\n\nAs organic reach decreases on nearly every platform, paid social media advertising becomes a must-use strategy for reaching your target audience. Learn more about social advertising stats to inform your strategy.\n\nTotal spend on social media advertising is projected to reach $219.8 billion in 2024.\n\nIt's now projected that $255.8 billion of total social media ad spending will be generated through mobile by 2028.\n\nTotal ad spend growth is anticipated at 6.1% in 2024.\n\nSocial media ads account for 28.8% of all digital advertising spend.\n\nBusinesses put around 8.7% of their total revenue towards their ads budget.\n\nSocial media ad spend is growing at a steady rate. With more marketers investing in ads, brands should get ready to allocate bigger budgets to paid marketing strategies to compete.\n\nFacebook statistics\n\nFacebook remains an advertising powerhouse. Whether or not brands should focus on Facebook is a tough question that really depends on your individual Facebook metrics. The following Facebook statistics can clue you in further.\n\nFacebook is the most-used platform by marketers worldwide (89%). Instagram sits in second place (80%).\n\nAs of Q3 2023, Facebook is the largest online social network in the world with roughly 3.05 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe average American spends about 31 minutes per day on Facebook.\n\n56.3% of Facebook users are male and 43.7% are female (based on available gender data).\n\nAlmost a quarter of Facebook users in the US are between the ages 25-34.\n\nFacebook remains a favorite among marketers. That’s not surprising, considering the massive reach offered by the platform. Plus, the increasing average age means more users are in high-level, decision-making positions in their careers.\n\nInstagram statistics\n\nInstagram boasts 2 billion actively monthly users and yet brands are still scrambling to get more Instagram followers. Below are the top social media statistics for Instagram.\n\nInstagram ties with Facebook for the social media platform with the highest ROI.\n\n27.4% of US Instagram users are between 25 and 34 years old.\n\n61.1% of total Instagram users worldwide are between the ages 18-34, and mostly identify as male.\n\nInstagram Reels generate more likes and saves, but fewer comments than regular posts.\n\nInstagram’s engagement rates are four times higher than Facebook (0.60% to 0.15%), but engagement has become more competitive each year.\n\nIn 2023, 43% of marketers plan to increase their investment in Instagram.\n\nOnce the go-to social platform for influencers, Instagram is facing competition from TikTok.\n\nStill, relatively high engagement rates, fresh ecommerce features and big ad spending signal that the future is still bright for Instagram.\n\nLinkedIn statistics\n\nLinkedIn has done a brilliant job of carving out its niche as the go-to professional network. The platform is a potential goldmine for B2B brands and the rapid growth of their ad platform speaks for itself. Here are some LinkedIn statistics you should know.\n\nThere are more than more than 1 billion members across 200 countries on LinkedIn.\n\nThe United States has the highest user rate in the world on LinkedIn with an audience reach of over 214 million users.\n\nThere are over 67 million company profiles on LinkedIn.\n\n60% of worldwide users are between ages 25 and 34 years old, far exceeding any other age group.\n\nSpurred by the widespread career changes over the past two years, the platform doesn’t look to slow down any time soon. Hint: now’s the time to level up your LinkedIn marketing if you’re in B2B.\n\nPinterest statistics\n\nPinterest often doesn’t get its due when it comes to social platforms. The platform’s diverse, big-spending audience is among the most dedicated and engaged of any network. Here are some top Pinterest statistics to look out for.\n\n482 million people use Pinterest every month.\n\n76.2% of Pinterest users are women, 17.2% are men and 6.6% are unspecified.\n\nIn December 2023 alone, nearly 1.2 billion visits were measured to Pinterest.com, from desktop and mobile.\n\n76.2% of worldwide Pinterest users identify as female.\n\nPinterest is the third-most visited social media website in the US.\n\n80% of weekly users have found a new brand or product on the platform.\n\nThe power of Pinterest advertising is well-documented and the platform is the perfect place to uncover new products. Also, marketers targeting a US audience would do well to include Pinterest in their marketing efforts.\n\nTikTok statistics\n\nTikTok has totally transformed itself to a must-have digital platform for brands. The platform’s rabid fanbase, rapid growth and sky-high usage spell great news for early adopters. Below are some interesting TikTok statistics to know about.\n\nTikTok is expected to reach over 2 billion users in 2024.\n\nTikTok is the most frequently used app worldwide, with Android phone users spending an average of 34 hours per month on the platform.\n\nTikTok’s user base skews female, with 48% of users identifying as women (based on available gender data.)\n\n36.7% of TikTok users are 18-24 years old and account for the largest share of TikTok’s advertising audience.\n\nTikTok is the second-most used video entertainment app by monthly active users.\n\nYounger consumers and smaller influencers dominate the platform right now, but that may change in the very near future. If you’re already on the platform, make sure to watch your TikTok analytics and how to reach your audience ASAP.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) statistics\n\nX, formerly Twitter, has cemented itself as the hub of political discussions, memes and a prime place to go back and forth with brands. Take a look at the Twitter statistics below to understand more about marketing on the platform.\n\nX boasts about 619 million monthly active users in total worldwide.\n\n53% of X users use the platform to get the latest news.\n\nMore than half (63%) of X users are men (based on available gender data).\n\n33% of users plan to spend less time on X in 2024.\n\nUS adults spend an average of 34.1 minutes daily on X.\n\nEven with the uncertainty of Z's future because of its last year, the platform appears to be growing, so marketers may not want to count it out yet.\n\nYouTube statistics\n\nTo compete with emerging platforms like TikTok, the second-largest search engine in the world is making some big changes. Here are the top YouTube statistics to know about.\n\nAs of January 2023, YouTube has nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide.\n\nYouTube Shorts has 2 billion monthly active users.\n\nYouTube's biggest gender segments are males aged between 25-34 (12.2%), and males aged between 35-44 (9.6%) (based on available gender data).\n\nYouTube users spend an average of 28 hours, 5 minutes on the Android app each month.\n\nNearly 90% of all visits to YouTube come from a mobile device.\n\nDespite the platforms in the market, YouTube is still users’ go-to video-sharing and video-consumption platform. With more people accessing the app on mobile, marketers would benefit from posting more short-form, vertical content (i.e. Shorts) on the platform.\n\nSocial media video statistics\n\nVideo continues to be an all-time favorite content type. It’s versatile, engaging and offers excellent ROI to marketers worldwide. Let’s look at some recent social media video statistics.\n\n44% of people prefer to learn about a new product or service via short video content.\n\n87% of marketers say video marketing has directly increased sales.\n\nShort-form video offers marketers the highest ROI of any social media marketing strategy, with 30-60 videos seeing the most success.\n\nUS video advertising is expected to increase from $76.97 billion in 2023 to $84.61 billion in 2024.\n\nVideo is making its way into all types of marketing strategies in virtually every industry. However, it’s evolving in its shape and form. Brands can expect to see better results from short-form video content that’s primarily entertaining and/or funny.\n\nInfluencer marketing statistics\n\nWorking with influencers is one of the best inbound marketing strategies being used today. Here are some influencer marketing statistics about which platforms marketers are leveraging, what they’re hoping to achieve and how they plan to execute influencer marketing in the future.\n\n50.1% of marketers believe TikTok offers the highest ROI to influencer marketers for short-form video content, followed by 29.9% of marketers saying Instagram Reels and 12% saying YouTube Shorts.\n\n69% of marketers use TikTok for influencer marketing, making it the most popular influencer marketing channel.\n\nGenerating more engagement, reaching new audiences and strengthening community are the top three marketing goals for working with creators.\n\n60% of marketers plan to spend more on influencer marketing campaigns in 2024.\n\n63% of marketers plan to use AI in launching their influencer campaigns. And 55% of these brands will use AI for identifying influencers.\n\nMore marketers are realizing the potential of influencer marketing. If influencers are not already part of your marketing efforts, it’s time to switch your focus. The key is to pick the best platforms and influencers for your brand, both of which can be automated using the right tools.\n\nConsumer behavior statistics\n\nThe concept of buying something you saw on social media is nothing new. From product recommendations to first impressions from brands, the impact of social media on consumers is well-documented. Learn more from these consumer behavior statistics.\n\n56.1% of internet users purchase a product online at least once a week.\n\n29.9% of internet users purchase a product using their mobile devices at least once a week.\n\n51.2% of people research brands online before making a purchase.\n\nThe biggest online purchase drivers across all ages are free shipping, coupons and discounts, or an easy return policy.\n\nThe recent growth of direct social sales is notable. Consumers likewise crave authenticity and ads that don’t feel like ads. But the key to selling on social is to know your customer, which platforms they prefer and how their unique buying behavior works.\n\nSocial Media Statistics FAQ\n\nWhat is the most used social media platform?\n\nThe most-used social media platform is Facebook with over 3 billion users. Facebook is followed by YouTube (2.94 billion users), WhatsApp and Instagram (tied at 2 billion users).\n\nIs social media use increasing?\n\nSocial media use is increasing year-over-year, albeit slowly.

There are over 5 billion social media user identities, meaning 62.3% of the population has created at least one social media account. That’s a massive potential reach. As long as you create the right strategy and target the right people, you should see success with social media marketing.\n\nAdditional resources for Social Media Statistics\n\nCategories\n\nWebinar\n\nFrom Pins to Leads: How Pictures Turn into Profit\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Analytics\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n40 Twitter (X) stats to know in marketing in 2024\n\nPublished on May 22, 2024 • Reading time 9 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nPinterest\n\nSocial Media Publishing\n\n24 must-know Pinterest stats for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on March 27, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Content\n\nVideo\n\n50+ Social Media Video Marketing Statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on March 26, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nYouTube\n\n25 YouTube stats marketers should know in 2024 [Updated]\n\nPublished on March 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nFacebook\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n24 Facebook statistics marketers should know in 2024\n\nPublished on March 19, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n27 TikTok statistics marketers need to know in 2024\n\nPublished on February 20, 2024 • Reading time 7 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\n50+ Must-know social media marketing statistics for 2024\n\nPublished on February 8, 2024 • Reading time 8 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSocial Media Trends\n\nLinkedIn statistics for marketers in 2024\n\nPublished on February 28, 2023 • Reading time 10 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n5 stats brands need to know to engage Irish & UK consumers\n\nPublished on July 18, 2019 • Reading time 4 minutes\n\nCategories\n\nData Report\n\nLeveling Up\n\nFrom conversation to connection: how brands can turn Likes into action\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Media Engagement\n\nSocial Media Strategy\n\n9 stats social media marketers need to show their bosses ASAP\n\nPublished on May 7, 2019 • Reading time 8 minutes"
