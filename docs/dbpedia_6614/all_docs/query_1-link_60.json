        "text": "Prospect Scoring\n\nAbout\n\nProspect scores are used to measure a Prospect’s intent and interest based on interactions with content. These scores help determine Prospect quality/readiness and whether they should be delivered to Sales for follow up.\n\nIn This Article\n\nAbout\n\nHow Does Prospect Scoring Work?\n\nInsightly Plan Information\n\nSales Potential\n\nImportant Details\n\nDefault Scoring Model\n\nEdit the Default Scoring Model\n\nCreating a Prospect Scoring Model\n\nRules and Scopes\n\nCreate a Prospect Scoring Model\n\nVerify a Score\n\nHow Does Prospect Scoring Work?\n\nCompanies with multiple products and/or services require the ability to track prospect engagement with their brand, as well as engagement with each of their products or business units. Tracking this information assists in determining how serious a Prospect’s interest is.\n\nInsightly Marketing enables users to create Prospect Scoring Models to assign scores to Prospects based on their engagement with each product and/or service both cumulatively and individually. Engagement can be tracked at the aggregate and individual product or business unit level. The Prospect score is made up of points that are assigned to every action a Prospect might take with marketing assets and this score can be viewed on each Prospect record.\n\nScores change over time as a Prospect interacts with marketing assets – the score will change based on the Prospect’s behavior. Points should be assigned to a Prospect’s score based on actions that are the most valuable, such as visiting a pricing page or registering for a Zoom Webinar. The higher the score, the more likely a Prospect is to move forward in the sales process. Scoring models provides Insightly Marketing users the ability to model and track a Prospect’s engagement; users can track engagement to the aggregate and individual product or business unit levels.\n\nInsightly Plan Information\n\nProspect Scoring Models are available on Plus, Professional, and Enterprise Insightly Marketing plans.\n\nPlus: The Default Scoring Model is the only model available for Plus subscriptions. Additional models cannot be created but the Default Scoring Model can have up to 13 rules added to it (the name or details of this model cannot be edited).\n\nProfessional: Four additional models with up to 15 rules per model can be created.\n\nEnterprise: Nine additional models with up to 15 rules per model can be created.\n\nSales Potential\n\nBy utilizing Prospect Scoring Models, marketers can gain deeper insights into what Prospects are interested in and therefore be able to nurture them more effectively, pass them onto the right sales representative, and help identify upsell opportunities.\n\nProspect Scoring Models assist in ranking each Prospect at any point and move them to Sales automatically when the time is right. This can be accomplished with no manual intervention by creating a Finish Action or a Journey action to notify users once a Prospect has reached a certain score.\n\nUse Cases\n\nScenario\n\nUse Case\n\nA hardware company that sells both hammers and mallets\n\nWhen a Prospect visits the company website and downloads information outlining the features of a new line of hammers, this activity is valued at 10 points in the Default Scoring Model and in a model that is specific to hammers. Two things will happen:\n\nThe Prospects overall score is raised by 10 points.\n\nThe Prospect’s score specific to hammers is raised by 10 points.\n\nA company has videos embedded on a Landing Page or a tracked website.\n\nThe Prospects score could be increased based on their engagement with the video in order to gauge the level of interest. Insightly can capture play, pause, and end events of the video usage.\n\nImportant Details\n\nAn update to a score will occur based on the action taken that changed the score, i.e. a Finish Action, a click, etc. Some actions that trigger a score change may result in a delay to the score being updated after the action has been taken.\n\nIf a Lead (within Insightly CRM) is linked to a Prospect, a corresponding read only custom field titled Score will be created and mapped to the Lead record in Insightly CRM. This custom field will be required to be added to the Lead Page Layout by System Administrators. This field can only be mapped to linked Leads and cannot be mapped to Contacts.\n\nOnly the very first email open and/or click action will be counted towards the Prospect’s score. For example, if there is a rule that is triggered by a webpage view and a rule triggered by a webpage visit, when the Prospect opens the website, both rules will be triggered, and the aggregate score will be updated for the Prospect.\n\nSetting a score is only available for the degradation rule and can only be set to zero.\n\nDefault Scoring Model\n\nEvery Prospect is assigned a score that is applied via the Default Scoring Model. This model cannot have its name or details edited and can only have one rule per action type (for example, if the Email Click action is added as a rule, it can only be added once.)\n\nOnce rules have been edited and/or deleted, the default rules can be restored by clicking the three dots menu on the far right of the model and selecting Reset to Default. This will delete all existing rules and reset the model to the original default rules.\n\nWhen a Prospect performs an action, Insightly will adjust their score according to the Default Scoring Model rules. The Default Scoring Model contains general configuration for rules and scoring which can be editing and/or removed.\n\nEdit the Default Scoring Model\n\nThis model cannot have its name or details edited and can only have one rule per action type (for example, if the Email Click action is added as a rule, it can only be added once.)\n\nTo edit the Default Scoring Model, select the model by clicking its name.\n\nThe Scoring Rulessection can be used to add, edit, or delete rules for the model.\n\nAdd a Rule: Click Add Rule.\n\nEdit a Rule: Click the Pen (edit) icon on the far right of the rule that requires editing.\n\nDelete a Rule: Click the trashcan (delete) icon on the far right of the rule that requires deleting.\n\nWhen adding or editing a rule, the rule definition can be selected and the resulting score adjustment can be defined. Review the Rules and Scopes section of this article for information pertaining to each rule definition type\n\nCreating a Prospect Scoring Model\n\nRules and Scopes\n\nA scoring model consists of rules that determine when points are added to or subtracted from a Prospect’s score. The scope of each rule can be triggered by a specific asset or by any activity of that type. For example, a rule could be configured that adds points to a Prospect’s Score for all Redirect Links they click.\n\nThe rules within a scoring model function in addition to any Finish Actions that already exist to adjust a Prospect's score, for example, adjusting a Prospect's score up or down after a specific action has taken place. Both sets of rules will be executed in these instances.\n\nRule\n\nScope\n\nProspect Opened Email\n\nScope can be defined as all emails, for a specified email, or for all emails in a specified folder. Insightly identifies when opens and/or clicks are suspected as originating from a bot; these opens and/or clicks will not affect a Prospect's score.\n\nProspect Clicked Email\n\nScope can be defined as all emails, for a specified email, or for all emails in a specified folder. Insightly identifies when opens and/or clicks are suspected as originating from a bot; these opens and/or clicks will not affect a Prospect's score.\n\nProspect Form Handler Submit\n\nScope can be defined as all forms, for a specified form, or for all forms in a specified folder.\n\nProspect Landing Page Visit\n\nScope can be defined as any landing page, a specified landing page, or a landing page in a specified folder.\n\nProspect Landing Page Form Submission\n\nIf any form handler is embedded within a landing page and a Prospect submits the form, this action will be triggered, and the score will be updated.\n\nScope can be defined as any landing page form, a specified landing page form, or a landing page in a specified folder.\n\nOpportunity Created\n\nAny Opportunity that has been created. If a Prospect has a linked Lead record within Insightly CRM, and that Lead is converted to an Opportunity, it will be identified as an Opportunity Created action.\n\nOpportunity Lost\n\nAny Opportunity that has been marked as Lost.\n\nIf an Opportunity that was created from the Opportunity Created action is lost, it will be identified as an Opportunity Lost action.\n\nProspect Viewed Webpage\n\nThis rule can be configured with a specific URL. If a prospect views the webpage, the rule will be triggered, and the score will be updated.\n\nScope can be defined as any webpage or a specific webpage.\n\nProspect Visited Website\n\nThis rule can be configured with a specific website that has been registered with Insightly’s domain management. If a Prospect visits the specified website, the rule will be triggered, and the score will be updated.\n\nProspect Played YouTube Video\n\nScope can be defined as any YouTube video or a specific YouTube video utilizing the YouTube video ID as shown below.\n\nProspect Clicked Redirect Link\n\nScope can be defined as any redirect link, a specified redirect link, or any redirect link in a specified folder.\n\nProspect Clicked Hosted File\n\nScope can be defined as any hosted file, a specified hosted file, or any hosted file in a specified folder.\n\nProspect Registered Zoom Webinar\n\nScope can be defined as any Zoom Webinar or for a specific Zoom webinar. The Zoom Webinar ID is required.\n\nThis rule will only display for users that have Zoom integration.\n\nProspect Attended Zoom Webinar\n\nScope can be defined as any Zoom Webinar or for a specific Zoom webinar. The Zoom Webinar ID is required.\n\nThis rule will only display for users that have Zoom integration.\n\nProspect Last Activity Older than X Days Ago\n\nThis rule will check a Prospect’s timeline to calculate the number of days since the last activity was performed. If it is more than the specified number of days, the score will be set to zero.\n\nProspect Custom EventThis rule will allows for the selection of a custom event that has been created.\n\nCreate a Prospect Scoring Model\n\nWithin Insightly Marketing, click the user profile in the upper right corner and select System Settings. Under the Feature Settings section, select Prospect Scoring.\n\nClick Add Model in the upper right. The Add New Scoring Model screen will load where the models name and the Prospect Score Field Label can be entered. To create the new model, click the Create Scoring Model button.\n\nThe Prospect Score Field Label will auto populate based on the entry in the Scoring Model Name field although, it can be edited if desired.\n\nThe new scoring model will now display in the list view of scoring models. To add rules to the scoring model, click its name to open its record and within the record, click the Add Rule button.\n\nIn the Rule Definition section, the rule type/activity and the applicable scope for the rule can be applied via the drop-down menus. Duplicate rules are not allowed within the same model.\n\nIn the Score Adjustment section, define how the Prospect’s score will be adjusted based off the action defined by the rule in the Rules Definition section.\n\nWhen the rule parameters have been appropriately set, click Save Rule to add the rule to the scoring model.\n\nVerify a Score\n\nAfter the System Administrator has added the Default Model’s Score field and any other custom model fields to the Prospect Page Layout, the scores can be reviewed and verified from a Prospect record’s Details tab.\n\nIn the example below, the Prospect Scoring section is shown on the Details tab of the Prospect record. This section contains the Default Score (Score) as well as several custom scoring models. In this example, the Prospect’s custom model Scores will be updated based on their interaction with specific products, such as mallets, hammers, etc."
