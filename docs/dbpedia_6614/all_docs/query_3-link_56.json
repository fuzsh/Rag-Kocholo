The Google™ Translate Service is offered as a convenience and is subject to applicable Google Terms of Service. Providing the service as a convenience is not an endorsement of the product or the results generated and nothing herein should be construed as such an approval or endorsement.\n\nThe content of State of Missouri websites originate in English. If there are differences between the English content and its translation, the English content is always the most accurate. By selecting a language from the Google Translate menu, the user accepts the legal implications of any misinterpretations or differences in the translation.\n\nAs Google's translation is an automated service it may display interpretations that are an approximation of the website's original content. You should not rely on Google™ Translate to provide an exact translation of the website. There are circumstances where the service does not translate correctly and/or where translations may not be possible, such as with certain file types, video content, and images. In addition, some applications and/or services may not work as expected when translated.\n\nThe State of Missouri has no control over the nature, content, and availability of the service, and accordingly, cannot guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of the translation.
