        "text": "“I want to be a musician but where do I start?” I bet this is the question you are asking yourself right now! Welcome to the club, my friend! A lot of people are still waiting in line wondering how to get into the music industry and how to become a music artist. But what if I told you that there are just a few things you need to learn in order to skip that line and start doing the real thing? I am not saying it’s easy to get into music and make it big! However, knowledge is power, no matter what you do, so keep reading to find out where to start if you want to choose the path that will lead you to a successful start of your music career!\n\nIn the following text, you will find 16 critical points that you must take seriously, but remember that your success in the music industry ultimately begins with the quality of your music. Therefore, make amazing music and be aware of everything that can be helpful on your journey!\n\n1. Figure Out Your Place in the Music Industry\n\nAsk yourself this if you begin to consider your music career:\n\nDo I want to be a singer?\n\nDo I prefer playing instruments?\n\nDo I want to be a singer who writes my own music?\n\nIs music production more appealing to me than performance?\n\nRemember, there is no such thing as a wrong answer. Everyone can find a palace in the music industry. There are many music career options to consider if you do not like being in the spotlight. Taking an honest look at your skill sets and what you enjoy doing will help you determine what is best for you in terms of starting a career in music.\n\nIt is important to think creatively because the possibilities are endless. You could work as a studio engineer, stage manager, film music composer, music teacher, etc.\n\nIn the following text, you will learn more about the dilemmas that most aspiring musicians face before they start a music career:\n\nMaking self-composed music or doing covers?\n\nHaving a band or going solo?\n\nGoing independent or signing with a record label?\n\nPhoto by icon0.com\n\nWhat Is The Best Age To Start A Music Career?\n\nEver stared at a music chart and thought, “Am I too young? Too old? When’s the magic moment to jump into the music scene?” We’ve all been there. Let’s hit the high notes and debunk some myths.\n\nStarting Young:\n\nStarting off young has its own rock star vibes. Many iconic names – think Justin Bieber or Billie Eilish – made waves while they were still figuring out high school!\n\nPros:\n\nEnergy & Time: You’ve got boundless energy and loads of time to hone your craft.\n\nFresh Perspective: Young artists often bring a unique, fresh spin to the industry.\n\nGrowth Arc: Starting early means you get to evolve and grow with your audience.\n\nCons:\n\nPressure: The music biz can be tough, and handling that pressure at a young age isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.\n\nMissed Childhood: There’s a risk of missing out on typical teenage fun.\n\nJumping In Later:\n\nLet’s bust a myth: You’re never “too old” to start. Susan Boyle and Leonard Cohen are just a couple of names that prove age is but a number when it comes to talent.\n\nPros:\n\nLife Experience: Older artists bring a depth and richness to their music shaped by diverse experiences.\n\nMaturity: With age comes a certain resilience and better handling of the industry’s highs and lows.\n\nCons:\n\nIndustry Bias: Let’s be real; the industry can sometimes favor younger stars.\n\nEnergy Levels: Touring and late-night gigs might be a tad more taxing.\n\nConcussion is that the best age to kickstart your music career is… drumroll… whenever you feel ready! Your passion, talent, and story matter more than the candles on your birthday cake. So, whether you’re 15 or 50, if the music’s calling you, pick up that mic and answer!\n\nMaking Self-composed Music or Doing Covers?\n\nWhen they first start out, a lot of musicians have trouble deciding what kind of music they want to play. The key is to play the music that you like and enjoy, the music that makes you feel amazing, because only then will your audience be able to connect with you.\n\nOnce you’ve found your groove, you will choose whether you want to compose and perform your own music or prefer to work on covering songs by other musicians. Your skills are, ultimately, what matters. Start with covers if you are not yet comfortable writing your own music. Even if you perform your own songs, most musicians will advise you to regularly practice songs by other artists. Doing covers will help you improve your abilities and gain insight into the composition of songs. It will change the way you hear music, which will improve your performance, whether you are a guitarist, singer, drummer, or producer.\n\nHaving a Band or Going Solo?\n\nA solo artist is not required to share the spotlight or the creative authority with anyone, and also gains a higher profit. However, there are some drawbacks as well. You might grow lonely and have a ton more work to do.\n\nThe idea behind starting a band is to find people you click with, start playing music, any kind of music, together, and develop a level of comfort with each other. The secret to a great band is in the chemistry that all the members share, but you will find yourself in circumstances where there are disagreements and confrontations, both of which have their benefits and drawbacks.\n\nConsider what would make you feel the most comfortable.\n\nGoing Independent or Signing With a Record Label?\n\nOnce more, using a DIY approach guarantees that you have total control over your music, your shows, and everything else. But this also implies that there is a lot of work involved. For example, you might discover that responding to emails takes more time than writing or practicing music.\n\nIf your workload becomes too much for you to handle and you have the financial means to do so, put together a team that will assist you. Therefore, seek out record labels willing to sign you on as an artist if you feel the administrative work is wearing you out and you aren’t spending enough time on your music.\n\nSigning with a label undoubtedly has advantages because it can offer you resources, contacts, and knowledge that let you concentrate more on the creative aspects. However, being signed to a label frequently entails making many compromises. Many of the choices affecting your music and your image will no longer be yours to make. When selecting a label, be cautious. Spend time researching and contacting record labels whose ideas match yours rather than impulsively signing a record deal.\n\n2. Set Specific Goals\n\nSetting goals and objectives will help you avoid wasting time. Work on short-term goals, such as recording a song until a certain date or playing a specific number of gigs. This will keep you focused and productive.\n\nOn the other hand, try looking at a broader perspective. Create long-term goals. Some aspire to be independent performing artists who travel the world. Others may wish to simply create music in order to obtain sync licensing deals for commercials or films. Not everyone will have the same ambitions or goals. It may take some time to figure out what your long-term goal is, and it may change as you gain experience. When you set long-term goals, you will find it easier to move forward and make better decisions.\n\n3. Invest in Your Growth\n\nRealizing that you must first invest in yourself is a necessary step in starting a career in music. Whether it’s a matter of time or money, you must be willing to put in the effort to learn and complete tasks.\n\nYou will need money to develop your music career, whether it be for hiring someone to create your website, paying for studio time, having CDs printed, hiring a designer for your merchandise, or hiring a vehicle to travel to performance venues. You must be willing to risk the money and believe in your own abilities. How can you expect fans or anyone else to put money or time into you if you can’t invest in yourself to look professional and create high-quality music?\n\nCan You Start a Music Career with No Money?\n\nAbsolutely! While having some cash on hand can smooth out the journey, passion and talent often speak louder than dollars. Here’s how you can kick things off on a shoestring:\n\nGo Digital: Platforms like TikTok, SoundCloud, and YouTube allow you to showcase your talent for free.\n\nLocal Gigs: Attend open mics or perform at community events. Exposure is key!\n\nDIY Recording: With a computer and some free software, you can begin your recording journey.\n\nNetworking: Team up with local artists. Sharing resources can cut costs.\n\nCrowdfunding: Consider platforms like Kickstarter to fund specific projects.\n\nRemember, it’s about the music, not the money. Hustle and creativity can take you a long way!\n\nShould I Only Focus on Making a Career in Music?\n\nTossing everything aside and attempting to support yourself through music right away is probably not a good idea. If you’re standing well financially this may not apply.\n\nThe circumstances of each person will vary, even though some are fortunate enough to enter the music industry without holding down a regular job. Don’t think working a day job is bad because we all have bills to pay and other adult obligations. You must schedule practice time no matter what. While doing this might require giving up some free time, it is totally worthwhile. At first, it may seem challenging to strike a balance between work and practice, but you’ll soon discover that it can work if you are self-disciplined. Also, being a musician is not cheap. You will need to upgrade and modify your equipment frequently, even if your cost of living is low. Without a day job at first, this can be challenging.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay\n\n4. Continue to Develop Your Skills\n\nKeep refining your talents and skills. Whether it’s singing, rapping, or producing, keep practicing and learning. Never stop developing as an artist!\n\nWhen I say you need to find time to practice no matter what, I really mean it! Although it might sound cliche, practice really does make everything perfect. Even if you are gifted, if you don’t put the time and effort into improving your abilities, you won’t get very far. For their live performances as well as to write better music together, bands need to regularly jam and practice. Even if you are a DJ, you should continue to refine and practice your transitions. Instrumental musicians can only improve by repeatedly performing their fundamental exercises.\n\nPlaying the same thing repeatedly might become monotonous. However, it will be simpler if you invest more time at the beginning of your music career or before you start your career in music. Your performance ability should be almost instinctual. Keep in mind that no one enjoys watching an artist stumble while playing on stage.\n\nWhat to Keep in Mind While Practicing\n\nPlaying your instrument well when you are by yourself is one thing, but playing well consistently in the studio or on stage is completely different. Hence, you need to keep training and practicing to play well in those professional environments. If you want to start a successful music career, you will need to specifically practice your ability to play consistently well in a variety of high-pressure situations.\n\nTherefore, the next time you practice, concentrate on playing whatever you already play consistently well rather than trying to play something faster or learn something new.\n\nSo, you need to practice under different circumstances to be able to play well under stress. For example:\n\nPlay the instrument while standing and walking around.\n\nPlay while your eyes are closed.\n\nPlay in front of as many people as possible to gain confidence.\n\nPractice at a bit faster tempo than you will need for the performance.\n\nFocus on the parts where you tend to make mistakes. Don’t brush them off in the hopes that you won’t make the same mistake again.\n\nWhen we are talking about those infamous mistakes, you should also know that no one plays at 100% every time. There will always be a few minor errors, and that’s perfectly acceptable. However, the point is that those little stumbles don’t disrupt the rest of the performance. Carry on and play as if the mistake never happened.\n\nThat is yet another thing that can be practiced! You can accomplish this by purposefully including little mistakes in your musical parts (but never to the point where they disrupt your proficient playing).\n\nThis not only teaches you how to handle mistakes gracefully but also teaches you how to maintain composure under pressure.\n\n5. Create an Outstanding Online Presence\n\nThese days, social media plays a significant role in our lives. In addition to being a fantastic live performer, an artist needs to have a carefully curated online presence that is relatable to their fans. Create accounts across all social media such as TikTok, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc. Post interesting videos related to your music and what inspires you. For example, read this guide to learn how to make your song go viral on TikTok. Discover the benefits of social media and be where your target audience is.\n\nYou should also have a clean and professional website. You can showcase and sell your albums on a website, post the dates of your events, engage with your fans, or just tell your story there. A website is like your online resume. I am sure you are asking yourself, can you just work with social media? Isn’t it enough? It depends on what you plan to do, but from my experience, having a website is a huge plus. It increases your chances of being recognized and allows your audience to find all your news in one place. So, help your audience while also helping yourself.\n\nPro tip: A professional photographer can help you get high-quality images of you or your band that you can use for your bio, website, and social media. This is great advice for those just starting out. If you come across as unprofessional, people may subconsciously associate you with lower quality and someone who is not deserving of their attention. For this reason, high-quality visual elements (photos, graphics, and videos) are essential to a successful online presence.\n\n6. Networking Is the Key\n\nYou need to network in the music industry! You should get to know other musicians, event organizers, tour managers, and other professionals because you never know what opportunities they might present to you.\n\nThe purpose of networking is to establish connections, meet musicians with whom you might collaborate, and identify potential team members, such as a manager, booking agent, or photographer. You’ll need a team, but you likely won’t have the money to pay them right away. As a result, you’ll need to collaborate with people on the same level as you and value what you offer.\n\nCreating connections within the local music and community scenes should be one of your first priorities. By becoming familiar with the various music venues and building connections with other local musicians and artists, you can network in your neighborhood, city, or educational institution. Building a local support group will help you go through this journey easily.\n\nOf course, you should do this in person and on the internet. You can find fans online, but that’s not all it is. Networking opportunities are available; you just need to know how to use them. Look for relevant online forums where you can participate and help out artists similar to you. By doing this, you can make contacts in the industry and meet other artists with whom you can collaborate in the future.\n\nPro tip:\n\nBe friendly to everyone you encounter, whether it’s the venue’s sound engineer or stage technician.\n\nRemember that a successful gig requires a team to pull it off.\n\nMake sure your actions have a positive impact on others.\n\nHow you present yourself will frequently determine whether or not you are considered for a position.\n\nPhoto by Athena\n\n7. Make Your Team Early On\n\nWe now have the ability to easily record music using personal laptops with high-quality equipment in the appropriate acoustic setting, but if you lack experience in some areas, make sure to have someone knowledgeable and skilled handle the rest.\n\nHowever, even if you are one of the few artists who enjoys managing the entire business operation and does it well, it is fine initially. Still, it would be challenging to advance in this manner when your music career takes off. If you want your music career to succeed in the future, you’ll need to find capable people you can trust. In the end, you want collaborators eager to advance and work hard alongside you and aren’t just out to cash in on your successes.\n\nWho Do You Need on the Team?\n\nMusic producers: Finding a producer to help you write and arrange your music is necessary if you are not skilled at creating music. In order to make your record sound professional, you will also need mix and master engineers. It is critical to work with a producer who understands both your music and your aesthetic. Find someone who will interpret your ideas and work magic into your music rather than working with someone just because they have a fascinating background.\n\nIf you have the necessary skills, you can do it yourself. However, keep in mind that getting input from other producers is important because their unbiased perceptions will often spot details that you might have missed during recording or mixing.\n\nManagers: Once your career takes off, you and the rest of the music industry will communicate with each other through your music manager. Make sure they understand your objectives. Managers occasionally serve as booking agents as well.\n\nPromoters and Agents: You’ll also need to communicate with booking agents and gig promoters, in addition to the music team. They are in charge of getting you the gigs you need and telling others about your music.\n\nYour team will grow as time passes. You will require assistance from others more as your schedule fills up. Your team will eventually become like a second family to you. As your career develops, you should think about adding the following individuals to your team:\n\nMarketing experts\n\nAssistants\n\nVisual artists and photographers\n\nEntertainment Lawyers\n\n8. Understand How to Distribute Your Music on the Internet\n\nBy putting your music on Soundcloud and Youtube, you can start building a following for your music career. However, you’ll eventually need better distribution, especially if you want to be taken seriously. You need a music aggregator (music distributor) to get your music into major outlets like Apple Music, Spotify, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Music, and many others.\n\nA few popular online distributors are:\n\nDitto Music\n\nDistroKid\n\nTuneCore\n\nCDBaby\n\nThese aggregators distribute your music directly to the major streaming and digital sales platforms, bypassing record labels. These services not only aid in getting your music onto platforms for purchasing and streaming it, but they also provide administrative publishing services that aid in obtaining royalties. Do your research before choosing one because their prices, fees, and available tools will vary.\n\nYou might experience extremely high music streaming numbers if you can get your music added to an editorial playlist on Spotify or Apple Music. As an artist, this can result in a lot of exposure. As a result, you might think about using services like SoundCampaign. We assist musicians in getting their music featured on Spotify playlists by connecting them with playlist curators.\n\nMonetize Music\n\nOf course, you won’t be able to make a lot of money from your music right from the start. Even so, it’s great to be aware that as a recording artist, music producer, songwriter, and/or composer, you may be able to generate a variety of income streams from your music when it’s played or used in various contexts. Of course, assuming you own the copyright to the songs. When someone streams your music on platforms like Spotify, Pandora, or Youtube, for instance, you are entitled to compensation or royalties from those companies.\n\n9. Know How Music Copyright Laws Work\n\nProtecting your music is one thing that is easily overlooked. When you release something, you must have copyright over your music and all necessary licenses. It’s crucial to have publishing rights because they protect you from plagiarism. Also, if your music is being used for commercial purposes, this will guarantee that you receive your royalty.\n\nThe American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers is an organization that pays royalties to artists who register with them. A company called Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) assists musicians in obtaining music licensing. ASCAP and BMI are Performance Rights Organizations. In the US, these organizations are in charge of royalties. SongTrust is a better choice for you if you want to license your music internationally.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nTo prevent potential legal action, be sure to know what you can and cannot do if you are a beat maker who uses samples to create a derivative work.\n\nIf you play in a band or other group, you must decide how you will divide ownership of the music you produce together.\n\nEven though discussing money and ownership can be difficult, it’s crucial to do so early on. When it comes to rights and investments, every member of your band, manager, or agent needs to be on the same page.\n\nPhoto by Ivan Samkov\n\n10. Develop Business Mindsets\n\nAlthough music is your passion, keep in mind that it is also a business. Remember that you are not just doing this as a hobby, but rather as a business. Be unbiased when making decisions when you want to start a music career.\n\nArguably, promoting your music is just as crucial as creating it. But, of course, making high-quality music is your top priority; marketing it through various channels comes second.\n\nIt might be difficult to strike a balance between the business and creative sides in order to create quality music, but that’s what you need to deal with. Check out our blog post to learn more about choosing the marketing plan that works in 2023! Read our article How to Create a Music Marketing Plan that Works in 2023.\n\nAt some point, you will need to do the following:\n\nCreate a marketing plan.\n\nDevelop a business plan.\n\nIdentify your target audience\n\nKnow how to use branding\n\nMake a budget for promotional and other expenses\n\nEmploy an accountant to manage your finances and file your taxes.\n\nMake use of legal counsel for assistance with contracts\n\nA DJ contract can provide stability and opportunities for growth, outlining important details such as performance expectations, compensation, and rights. By combining musical talent with effective networking and business savvy, aspiring musicians can navigate the complexities of the music industry and pave the way for a successful career.\n\nIf you intend to hire others to handle aspects of your business and marketing, it is critical that you continue to educate yourself in these areas and understand what to expect from them. Even if you dislike the business aspect of music, you still need to be knowledgeable and educated to make the best choices for your career.\n\n11. Develop Your Release Strategies\n\nYou must prepare a release schedule for any content you have, whether it be a single, an album, or a music video. Your music won’t magically gain popularity if you randomly upload it to the internet. Hence, release plans are important. Establish deadlines and make sure to meet them. Release dates are planned by artists or their public relations departments weeks or even months in advance.\n\nGive your audience plenty of notice when something is coming up. You can do this by posting audio samples or video trailers announcing the release date on your social media accounts. This will spark interest and keep your audience interested. This will keep your audience interested and pique their curiosity.\n\nDon’t forget to organize your licenses and uploads. It is not a good idea to wait until the last minute because many things could go wrong.\n\nPro tip: Speed has become a crucial aspect of music production. By “speed,” I mean how quickly you can consistently release new music to stay in the public eye and keep fans interested.\n\n12. Make Captivating Music Videos\n\nPeople are drawn to visual elements. A great music video can help your career bloom. The truth is that quality music doesn’t necessarily require a high budget. Videos made on a shoestring budget frequently gain popularity online. All that matters is how fascinating and captivating they are.\n\nFind artists who are willing to cooperate with you and with whom you can be your true artistic self. Work on your ideas thoroughly and always ask for feedback.\n\n13. Make Your Live Show Better\n\nIf your audiences aren’t entertained, they won’t pay to attend your performances. Make certain that each live performance is enjoyable. Your audience should feel completely satisfied, even if there are only 5 people there. Play a variety of gigs. You will gain a tremendous amount of experience and help to expand your comfort zone.\n\nDetermine whether you are a storyteller who can captivate the audience with a conversation between songs or an artist who performs the entirety of your setlist without giving the audience a chance to rest. You can judge this more accurately with the more shows you perform.\n\nRecording your performances as much as possible when you first start is a good idea. This will not only assist you in producing content for later releases, but it will also assist you in identifying areas that require improvement. Evaluate yourself after each performance because it can be challenging to be objective about your work.\n\nRemember that your fans didn’t have to come to see you perform live; they could have enjoyed your music in the comfort of their own homes. They’ve made an effort, so you should too. Lighting, backdrops, and even equipment are visual components that significantly enhance performances. Stick to an aesthetic when creating your visual presentation; don’t let it be random.\n\n14. Discovering Your Most True Self\n\nBefore you begin your journey, list your ideals and values. Always be true to who you are. Be distinctive because an artist’s music is driven by their authenticity. All the feelings and encounters that went into its creation are embodied in it. Even at the top of your career, you must maintain your authenticity.\n\nMusic that comes from the heart can connect with a listener. Even though it is simple only to create music for financial gain, this is a very limited perspective. Doing something just because it will sell is not a good idea.\n\nEstablish Your Artistic or Brand Identity\n\nTo make it simpler for people to recognize and set you apart from other artists, you need to develop your brand identity. It’s too ambiguous to describe yourself as a “male singer” or “a producer from New Jersey.” The idea is to make it clear what people can anticipate hearing from you. Other than music, what other scenes, subcultures, pastimes, lifestyles, or interests are you into?\n\nCreating your brand and identity enables potential fans to assess whether your music speaks to them. Keep in mind that not everyone will enjoy your music, but also keep in mind that you need to find listeners who will value your work and truly understand it.\n\n15. Always maintain your mental health\n\nYour overall well-being greatly depends on your mental health. It’s possible that you’ll have moments of self-doubt, but it’s crucial to avoid letting these negative feelings rule your mind.\n\nRegular exercise or participation in a physical sport is one of the best ways to combat depressive and anxious feelings. In order to maintain good mental health, many musicians engage in yoga and meditation. Stress can also result from fatigue. Try to distract yourself by picking up a new hobby. Do whatever brings you peace and enjoyment, and be open about any problems you may be experiencing. Never hesitate to ask for help!\n\n16. Prepare your mind for a long journey.\n\nThe fact that only 20 of your friends and family members listened to your first song on YouTube doesn’t guarantee that you won’t have thousands of listeners in the future. It really does take time and effort to build a reputation for yourself and gain traction.
