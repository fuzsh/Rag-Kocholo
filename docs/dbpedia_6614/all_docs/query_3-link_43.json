Except as otherwise provided in this section, in a prosecution for a violation of NRS 201.020, the defendant may claim as an affirmative defense that he or she was unable to provide the child support or spousal support ordered by a court.\n\n2. In addition to the written notice required by NRS 174.234, a defendant who intends to offer the affirmative defense described in subsection 1 shall, not less than 20 days before trial or at such other time as the court directs, file and serve upon the prosecuting attorney a written notice of his or her intent to claim the affirmative defense.

Each party has a continuing duty to file and serve upon the opposing party any change in the last known address of any witness that the party proposes to offer to establish or discredit the affirmative defense described in subsection 1.\n\n5. Each party has a continuing duty to disclose promptly the names and last known addresses of any additional witnesses which come to the attention of that party and which that party proposes to offer to establish or discredit the affirmative defense described in subsection 1.\n\n6.

No other or greater evidence is required to prove the marriage of the spouses, or that the defendant is the parent of the child or children, than is required to prove such facts in a civil action.\n\n2. In no prosecution under NRS 201.015 to 201.080, inclusive, does any existing statute or rule of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between spouses apply, and both spouses are competent witnesses to testify against each other to any and all relevant matters, including the fact of the marriage and the parentage of any child or children, but neither may be compelled to give evidence incriminating himself or herself.\n\n3. Proof of the failure of the defendant to provide for the support of the spouse, child or children, is prima facie evidence that such failure was knowing.\n\n[6:170:1923; NCL § 10521]—(NRS A 1985, 64; 1999, 3570; 2017, 787)\n\nNRS 201.080 Uniformity of interpretation. NRS 201.015 to 201.080, inclusive, shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate their general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact them.\n\n[7:170:1923; NCL § 10522]\n\nPATERNITY FRAUD\n\nNRS 201.085 Definition; penalty.\n\n1.

Contributory neglect or contributory delinquency is a misdemeanor.\n\n2. A person does not commit a violation of subsection 1 by virtue of the sole fact that the person delivers or induces the delivery of a child to a provider of emergency services pursuant to NRS 432B.630.\n\n[Part 1:165:1909; A 1911, 382; 1921, 21; 1955, 152]—(NRS A 1967, 474; 1973, 1351; 2001, 1265)\n\nCONCEALING BIRTH\n\nNRS 201.150 Definition; penalty.

It is not necessary to prove either of the marriages by the register and certificate thereof, or other record evidence, but those marriages may be proved by such evidence as is admissible to prove a marriage in other cases, and when the second marriage has taken place without this State, cohabitation in this State after the second marriage constitutes the commission of the crime of bigamy.\n\n4. This section does not extend:\n\n(a) To a person whose spouse has been continually absent from that person for the space of 5 years before the second marriage, if he or she did not know the spouse to be living within that time.\n\n(b) To a person who is, at the time of the second marriage, divorced by lawful authority from the bonds of the former marriage, or to a person where the former marriage has been by lawful authority declared void.\n\n[1911 C&P § 191; RL § 6456; NCL § 10138]—(NRS A 1967, 475; 1979, 1428; 1995, 1197; 2017, 787)\n\nNRS 201.170 Marrying person already married; penalty.

The Legislature finds and declares that:\n\n(a) The medical profession in the United States recommends that children from birth to the age of 1 year should be breast fed, unless under particular circumstances it is medically inadvisable.\n\n(b) Despite the recommendation of the medical profession, statistics reveal a declining percentage of mothers who are choosing to breast feed their babies.\n\n(c) Many new mothers are now choosing to use formula rather than to breast feed even before they leave the hospital, and only a small percentage of all mothers are still breast feeding when their babies are 6 months old.\n\n(d) In addition to the benefit of improving bonding between mothers and their babies, breast feeding offers better nutrition, digestion and immunity for babies than does formula feeding, and it may increase the intelligence quotient of a child. Babies who are breast fed have lower rates of death, meningitis, childhood leukemia and other cancers, diabetes, respiratory illnesses, bacterial and viral infections, diarrheal diseases, otitis media, allergies, obesity and developmental delays.\n\n(e) Breast feeding also provides significant benefits to the health of the mother, including protection against breast cancer and other cancers, osteoporosis and infections of the urinary tract. The incidence of breast cancer in the United States might be reduced by 25 percent if every woman breast fed all her children until they reached the age of 2 years.\n\n(f) The World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens Fund have established as one of their major goals for the decade the encouragement of breast feeding.\n\n(g) The social constraints of modern society weigh against the choice of breast feeding and lead new mothers with demanding time schedules to opt for formula feeding to avoid embarrassment, social ostracism or criminal prosecution.\n\n(h) Any genuine promotion of family values should encourage public acceptance of this most basic act of nurture between a mother and her baby, and no mother should be made to feel incriminated or socially ostracized for breast feeding her child.\n\n2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a mother may breast feed her child in any public or private location where the mother is otherwise authorized to be, irrespective of whether the nipple of the mothers breast is uncovered during or incidental to the breast feeding.\n\n3. As used in this section:\n\n(a) Chronic disease means a health condition or disease which presents for a period of 3 months or more or is persistent, indefinite or incurable.\n\n(b) Obesity means a chronic disease characterized by an abnormal and unhealthy accumulation of body fat which is statistically correlated with premature mortality, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other health conditions, and may be indicated by:\n\n(1) A body mass index of 30 or higher in adults;\n\n(2) A body mass index that is greater than two standard deviations above the World Health Organizations growth standard for children who are at least 5 but less than 19 years of age, or greater than three standard deviations above the standard for children who are less than 5 years of age;\n\n(3) A body fat percentage greater than 25 percent for men or 32 percent for women; or\n\n(4) A waist size of 40 inches or more for men or 35 inches or more for women.\n\n(Added to NRS by 1995, 126; A 2017, 1332)\n\nOBSCENITY\n\nNRS 201.235 Definitions.

If the court discharges the person and dismisses the proceedings against the person, a nonpublic record of the discharge and dismissal must be transmitted to and retained by the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety solely for the use of the courts in determining whether, in later proceedings, the person qualifies under this section for participation in a program of treatment for persons who solicit prostitution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, discharge and dismissal under this subsection is without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose, but is a conviction for the purpose of additional penalties imposed for a second or subsequent conviction or the setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the person discharged, in the contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the proceedings. The person may not be held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge the proceedings in response to an inquiry made of the person for any purpose. Discharge and dismissal under this subsection may occur only once with respect to any person.
