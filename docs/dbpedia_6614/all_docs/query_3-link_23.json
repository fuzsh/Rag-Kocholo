        "text": "SORNA\n\nSORNA is the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, which is Title I of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248). SORNA is codified at 34 U.S.C. § 20901 et seq. SORNA provides a comprehensive set of minimum standards for sex offender registration and notification in the United States. SORNA aims to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior law and generally strengthens the nationwide network of sex offender registration and notification programs. Additionally, SORNA does the following:\n\nExtends the jurisdictions in which registration is required to include federally recognized Indian tribes, in addition to states, the District of Columbia and the principal U.S. territories.\n\nIncorporates a more comprehensive group of sex offenders and sex offenses for which registration is required.\n\nRequires sex offenders to register and keep their registration current in each jurisdiction where they live, work or go to school.\n\nRequires sex offenders to provide more extensive registration information.\n\nRequires sex offenders to make periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information.\n\nExpands the information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders.\n\nMakes changes in the required minimum duration of registration for sex offenders.\n\nLegislation That Amended SORNA\n\nKeeping the Internet Devoid of Predators Act (KIDS Act). To address the issue of online safety, the 2008 KIDS Act made the following changes to SORNA —\n\nRequired jurisdictions to collect sex offenders' internet identifiers in the registration process.\n\nExempted posting of internet identifiers on any registration jurisdiction's public sex offender registry website.\n\nMilitary Sex Offender Reporting Act. As part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, and as an amendment to SORNA, these sections —\n\nRequired the Department of Defense to submit information on any sex offender convicted via court-martial to NSOR and NSOPW.\n\nInternational Megan's Law. To address international travel by registered sex offenders, this 2016 law mandated the following —\n\nRequired offenders to provide advance notice of any intended international travel.\n\nRequired jurisdictions to submit international travel information. (See the Information Required for Notice of International Travel below for more details.)\n\nAttorney General Guidelines\n\nIn addition to SORNA’s codified requirements, the Attorney General has issued guidelines and a rule to assist jurisdictions with implementation of the law, and the SMART Office has issued implementation documentation with additional guidance. Jurisdictions should use these documents, along with the statute (P.L. 109-248) and the guidelines and regulations issued by the Attorney General, when developing legislation and policies to substantially implement SORNA.\n\nSupplemental Guidelines for Juvenile Registration Under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n\nThe Attorney General issued these Supplemental Juvenile Registration Guidelines to provide guidance regarding the substantial implementation of the juvenile registration requirement under SORNA.\n\nEffective date: August 1, 2016\n\nSupplemental Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification\n\nThe Attorney General issued these Supplemental Guidelines to address a number of issues related to implementation of the SORNA requirements, including public website posting of sex offender information such as email addresses and other internet identifiers, public notification of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for serious sex crimes, international travel reporting requirements and the treatment of Indian tribes newly recognized by the federal government subsequent to the enactment of SORNA.\n\nEffective date: January 11, 2011\n\nThe National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification\n\nThe Attorney General issued these Final Guidelines to interpret and implement SORNA. The Final Guidelines provide jurisdictions with guidance, explanation and advice regarding the administration and implementation of SORNA.\n\nEffective date: July 2, 2008\n\nRule\n\nRegistration Requirements Under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n\nThe Attorney General issued this Rule to provide a concise and comprehensive statement of what sex offenders must do to comply with SORNA's requirements.\n\nEffective date: January 7, 2022\n\nRetroactive Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)\n\nThe Attorney General published this Rule to specify that SORNA applies retroactively to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required before the enactment of SORNA.\n\nInterim Rule effective date: February 28, 2007 | Final Rule effective date: January 28, 2011\n\nSORNA Implementation Documents\n\nThe SMART Office has developed a series of documents related to SORNA. These documents provide further definition, guidance and direction on a number of topics to assist jurisdictions with the implementation of SORNA.\n\nSORNA implementation documents address the following topics:\n\nSubstantial Implementation of SORNA\n\nByrne JAG Grant Reductions under SORNA\n\nIn Person Verification\n\nCommunity Notification Requirements of SORNA\n\nUsing Risk Assessment Under SORNA\n\nDetermination of Residence, Homeless Offenders and Transient Workers\n\nText of Registration Offense\n\nMilitary Convictions Under SORNA\n\nFingerprints and Palm Prints\n\nRegistering Tribal Convictions under SORNA\n\nState and Tribal Information Sharing\n\nClarification of Registration Jurisdictional Issues\n\nTribal Election, Delegation to the State and Right of Access\n\nInformation Required for Notice of International Travel\n\nJuvenile Registration and Notification Requirements Under SORNA"
