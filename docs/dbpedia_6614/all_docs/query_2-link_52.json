        "text": "The American dance industry has evolved and changed over time. It originally started out focused on Ballet for political purposes and slowly evolved into a more expansive industry, opening its arms to other styles such as Jazz, Modern, Hip Hop, and Contemporary to name a few. Dancers would strictly perform for audiences in large theaters and arenas. Becoming a staple dancer and choreographer within the industry was harder to come by and required lots of experience and exposure to the industry and other influential individuals. However, recently, the world has changed, and along with it, the dance industry. Social media quickly and loudly interrupted the way individuals consume media and participate in the internet. Dancers and choreographers found a way to utilize it as a tool to market themselves and showcase their talents. Dancers now have a more expansive audience than before. It used to be limited to people within the theater, but now, dancers and choreographers can share their talents and work through TV, Social media, and Film as well. Dancers are now able to book jobs and connect with industry professionals through social media like never before. I will dive deeper into the effects social media has had on the dance industry, on social, geographical, and personal levels throughout this piece.\n\nPositives Of Social Media within the Dance Industry\n\nDancers saw opportunities within Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube in the early stages of social media as platforms in which to market themselves and gain industry exposure. Organizations and individuals are now able to use social media as a tool to build their own brand to highlight their personality and professional abilities for exposure and potential job opportunities. (Social Media for dancers, the pros and cons). Traditionally, dancers would move to a city where the dance industry was booming, typically New York City and/or California, to audition for agents and be in close proximity to jobs and other opportunities. For years, agents have signed dancers and helped push them into industry auditions and book professional jobs. Although this is still a very important, successful, and essential way for dancers to find success in the field, the invention of social media has definitely altered the process. Dancers can also book jobs on their own, without an agent, based on the content they post and the following they have gained. This is where Dance Influencers were formed (Social Media changed the dance industry. L.A. Influencers show how). Some dancers have found a way to slip through the cracks of social media and be highly recognized for their talents. Talent agencies have seen the importance of a successful social media account for dancers and now use it almost as an insurance policy when signing dancers. It plays a part in their process of selecting dancers to sign. Oftentimes, casting directors ask prospective signees to include their socials within their resumes. This is done in order for the agency to take a deeper look into not only who the prospect is as a dancer, but also their personality and work ethic.\n\n“Social media allows dancers, choreographers, teachers, audiences and fans to post and share dance to a nearly infinite internet audience” (Social Media: How Does It Affect The Dance World)\n\nUnfortunately, social media accounts for dancers are transitioning to a necessity, emphasizing the need for likes and comments. (Later on, I will talk about how this affects the mental health of dancers, but for now, I will stay on topic; How social media is opening up dancers to other opportunities and avenues into the dance industry). Of course, there are always exceptions, but follower counts and overall exposure of their page are now becoming a huge part of signing with an agency or booking a job. However, it is again important to emphasize that dancers still have the ability to infiltrate the industry on their own because of social media…\n\nDance Influencers and The Breaking Of Dance Stereotypes.\n\nAmanda LaCount, a Dance Influencer, got a DM from Parris Goebel, Choreographer for Justin Bieber, Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj, and Rhianna, asking her to audition for a job. (Social Media changed the dance industry. L.A. Influencers show how). Parris Goebel originally made a name for herself as a choreographer by posting her work on Instagram and YouTube. Her latest industry job was choreographing Rhianna’s 2023 Super Bowl Halftime show. After receiving Paris’ DM, Amanda has gone on to have a highly successful career dancing backup to huge artists such as Rihanna and Meghan Trainor. Both Amanda and Paris are prime examples of dancers who have successfully marketed themselves on social media.\n\nSocial media has been used as a gateway to usher in change within the dance industry through brave individuals such as Amanda LaCount, Darrion Gallegos, Yanis Marshall, and to name a few. They all post content on their platforms to showcase their individuality and authenticity ultimately breaking boundaries placed upon them by the dance industry and the world.\n\nAmanda LaCount uses her platform to inspire and actively break down a stereotype that exists within the dance industry: The representation of hyper-skinny bodies within dance media throughout history and even still a little bit today. As a plus-sized woman, Amanda is inspiring thousands of dancers across the world and consistently showing them that every body and everybody can dance and be wildly successful. Recently, the dance industry has seen all body types starting to get represented behind artists such as Lizzo and Cardi B. Although social media can be used by brave individuals as a tool to usher in change, there is still an issue with dancers constantly being exposed to the content of women with the “ideal body type” wearing very sexy clothing pushed on social media.\n\nDarrian Gallegos and Yanis Marshall much like Amanda, use social media to be authentically themselves. These two are breaking gender norms; Yanis is famous for dancing in and teaching a heels class, while Darrien dances backup for Arianna Grande where he dresses and performs in more feminine roles (Social media changed the dance industry. L.A. influencers show how)\n\nMisty Copeland broke racial barriers and body type expectations within the Ballet world. For many years, ballerinas were expected to be super skinny to the point where it was unhealthy. Misty Copeland has a busty chest and is incredibly muscular, which are two attributes that were not celebrated within the stringent ballet world. She has gone on to have one of the most successful careers ever and inspires thousands of African American dancers across the world. The ballet industry moves slower than the commercial dance industry. Misty Copeland’s more recent break into ABT (American Ballet Theater Located in New York City) changed the course of ballet and history in general because she was the first-ever African-American principal dancer within the company.\n\nSocial Media Connects Dancers, Teachers, and Choreographers To The Industry\n\nThe way Amanda LaCount booked her first industry job highlights another amazing aspect of social media, especially within the dance industry. That is the access to communication with others from all over the world. Social media is a communication web that has the ability to connect us to all sorts of people within all sorts of industries. Anyone can message, follow, or tag industry professionals to gain exposure and a potential mentor. Features such as Direct Messaging (DM-ing) make connecting and communicating with industry professionals, dance companies, talent agencies, etc., much easier and accessible to all.\n\nYoung dancers all around the united states have definitely utilized this feature on their social media accounts. Dance Conventions are events in which industry professionals teach the next generation of dancers. Students of all ages take classes all weekend to gain insights and experience working with current industry professionals (both professional dancers and teachers/choreographers teach on these weekends). Kids later post videos or pictures from the weekend and tag their favorite industry professionals/teachers of the event. Dancers are often able to gain their attention on social media through that. Possible getting a like, comment, or follow from a working professional within the industry. This is a fairly new part of the dance industry, attributed to social media.\n\nI myself have experienced the connective capabilities of social media with industry professionals. I have posted after a convention weekend and gotten interactions and sometimes follows from faculty members. Many people within the dance industry are so inspirational and want to help others navigate their careers and often provide encouragement and compliments either in comments or direct messages. It is amazing how accessible social media makes conversations and interactions.\n\nEffects Social Media Has Had On Choreographers\n\nSocial media, much like for dancers, provided teachers and choreographers with platforms to share their work and get recognition. Their accounts are an extension of them and their talents, making it a huge part of pushing their name out into the industry for being a great educator and choreographer.\n\nMatt Steffanina posted content of dancers performing his choreography on YouTube. The videos blew up on the internet and allowed for huge choreographic opportunities for stars such as Chris Brown and Jason Derulo. (Source: Social Media Changed the Dance Industry. L.A. Influencers show how). Paris Goebel has huge industry opportunities from posting her work on Youtube and Instagram. She ran a Hip Hop dance company, named The Royal Family, and got enormous recognition for her innovative and iconic choreography. She has gone on to have an illustrious career choreographing Jlo and Rhianna’s halftime shows.\n\nThe newest social media platform that celebrated dance was TikTok. During the beginning of the 2019 pandemic, this platform experienced an exponential boom unlike anything ever seen before. The number one thing that was trending on the app in the earlier stages, was TikTok dance trends. This was a great platform for choreographers to post their work for others to dance to. Although this was a great way for a choreographer’s work to spread, trends took off so fast and people would not tag the original creator of the dance so choreographers wouldn’t get the credit.\n\nThis issue of dance plagiarism is huge on social media through TikTok and other mediums. TikTok is a little different because the dances are short combos created to be learned and shared. However, there is still a lack of choreographer credit for the origin of the trend. In other words, choreographers @’s were often left out of captions as their work would spread like wildfire, leaving them with recognition. There is a bigger issue for choreographers who post their work on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, etc. Some people take choreography from creators online by setting phrases and sometimes even whole pieces on dancers within their own establishment, taking credit for another person’s work. Teachers and choreographers post online to show their work and get exposure, not for it to be stolen from them.\n\nThe Negative Effects Social Media Has Had On The Dance Industry.\n\nSocial Media Impacts the Mental Health Of Dancers\n\nOur access to an abundance of content showcasing so many talented dancers can breed a lack of self-esteem. Dancers can find themselves in an unhealthy cycle of comparing themselves to others and potentially pushing their individuality down to follow trends and dance like others. Dancers can feel that they are not good enough because there is so much talent in the world and pushed out on social media. It is a part of human nature to compare. This was always a difficult part of dance that individuals have had to learn to overcome, but social media has exacerbated this part of dance.\n\nIt is also very easy for dancers to be consumed or obsessed over how many likes their posts get or how many followers they have. This is prevalent in society as a whole but is especially prevalent within the dance community. This is largely due to the fact that high account engagement is often paired with success.\n\nI have first-hand felt the implications of social media on my mental health. Although I feel very lucky that I have never allowed myself to let social media consume me, I have fallen victim to comparing myself to other dancers by watching videos on social media. It is both amazing and difficult to have access to so many talented dancers through social media. However, as I have gotten older, I have learned through my own self-evaluation and appreciation, to look to others for inspiration, not use them as a mechanism to speak or think negatively of myself and my talents. I think that this is something that is addressed by dancers on social media but should be shared way more than it has been.\n\nAt the end of the day, dance is a common language. It is an art form supposed to be felt, shared, and experienced. It is beautiful that social media has allowed dance to be shared on a much larger scale. With that being said, It is important for dancers to remember that everyone brings their own unique and special qualities to dance that no other person can do exactly the same. In dance and other areas of life, individuals should not try to be someone else. You can look to someone as a role model or for inspiration but learn to appreciate and celebrate your own individuality as well.\n\nSocial Media Breeds Hate\n\nIt is easy for people to spread hate online because they can hide behind screens blatantly bullying others (Social Media for dancers, the pros and cons). The dance community is generally supportive and kind, but that is not to say hate is not experienced by dancers, teachers, or choreographers through social media.\n\nI was always taught growing up that hurtful behavior is often a reflection of that individual’s own hurt and pain they are projecting onto me. The dance community is supposed to be encouraging and accepting of all. However there are still people within, and outside individuals who chose to use the platforms to spread hate. This is an issue all across the internet that we need to learn how to combat.\n\nLike a lot of things in the world, social media can be used for so much good, but it can also be used for evil. It is important that individuals within the dance industry, who have legitimate marketing reasons to utilize social media, do not feed into the negativity that can be felt online. Change starts with one individual and spreads to many. If dancers spread love on social media, which they oftentimes do, we would be able to see how that positively influences others outside of the community to behave the same way.\n\nSocial Media Is Affecting The Physical Health Of Dancers\n\nDance educators are worried about young dancers today as they see postural misalignment due to their constant use of technology; Tech neck. (Social Media For Dancers, the Pros and Cons). The term Tech neck refers to the downward slanting of the neck and overall slouched posture of the upper spine from the constant state of looking down on their phones and at social media. Believe it or not, this has major implications on the health of their bodies, and a dancer’s ability to dance long-term. Proper body alignment, aka neutral spinal and pelvic alignment, is essential to the health and longevity of a dancer.\n\n“To combat tech neck, strengthen your upper back muscles in Pilates and ballet classes, and be mindful of your head and neck placement when you do use technology” (Social Media For Dancers, the Pros and Cons)\n\nCorrect posture or neutral alignment helps dancers stay on center and prevent injuries of all kinds. Tech neck pushes the upper spine forward and could make dancers more susceptible to falling forward out of movements and to injuries. The constant state of slouching from looking down at technology can also cause difficulties in moving the upper spine and the neck in the opposite direction. This is a very big issue for dancers specifically because fluidity and mobility of all curvatures of the spine are essential in dance.\n\nCovid-19 Pushed The Dance Industry To Completely Lean Into Digital World And Opportunities\n\nRecently, with the global pandemic of Covid-19, the dance industry found ways to further utilize the technology at our fingertips in order to keep the industry alive and keep people employed. There are lasting innovations from the pandemic, such as online classes, that will forever continue to be used within the dance industry to open up to a wider pool of dancers. Social media has helped the dance industry transcend geographical limitations.\n\n“Throughout COVID, when dance companies’ performances were canceled and theaters were closed, directors and choreographers turned to technology and social media to still let their work be seen. Classes and behind-the-scenes footage were made available on Instagram Live, and entire full-length productions were live-streamed on YouTube and Facebook, showing that not even a pandemic could stop the dance world.” (Social media: How does it affect the dance world?)\n\nSocial media and the digital world, in general, pushed the dance industry into teaching and taking full classes through the digital Zoom world. This opened up so many opportunities for choreographers, teachers, and dancers. Initially, Zoom classes, much like in the educational system, were used as a mechanism to continue training, keep businesses running, and keep teachers or choreographers employed. What came out of the digital transition of the pandemic was much more access to students and teachers, different techniques, working professionals, material posted, and online teaching programs.\n\nDance teachers, choreographers, and dancers had to learn how to teach and take classes on Zoom. Dance is a very personal sport, where physical contact is an instrumental tool used by teachers to help their students. This was obviously not an option during the 2020 global pandemic, thus teachers and students had to completely adjust their way of taking and/or teaching classes. Because cameras often flip images, teachers had to begin specifying what foot they were stepping on, what direction they were turning, etc. Normally dancers in the room would see and mimic the teachers to learn exercises and choreography. During the pandemic, however, this was no longer the most effective way to learn choreography or take classes in general. Hyper specific language had to be used when teaching and learning on Zoom. That was the most effective way for teachers to teach and students to learn through Zoom. With that being said, teachers, students, and choreographers quickly adjusted to learning and teaching digitally and are continuing to use it as a tool.\n\nWithout a doubt, social media has changed the dance industry by widely opening up opportunities for dancers, teachers, choreographers, and dance businesses/ business owners. It can be used as a mechanism for self-marketing and branding and as a means of communication and connection. Social media also helps defy geographical limitations and spread the art form to the entirety of the community and beyond. In general, social media has opened up connective capabilities like never before, but within the small dance world, it has brought a tight-knit community even closer together.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCallahan, Mary. “Social media for dancers: The pros and cons.” Dance Informa., 1 August 2021, https://www.danceinforma.com/2021/08/01/social-media-how-does-it-affect-the-dance-world/.
