        "text": "Hi I'm Naomi. I'm a respiratory nurse specialist at Asthma + Lung UK. I'm going to tell you how to use a peak flow meter.\n\nWhen you first get a peak flow meter, ask your GP, asthma nurse or pharmacist to show you how to use it and how to take a reading.\n\nIf you're checking your peak flow at home, you need to take your peak flow at least twice a day, every day to get a useful pattern of results. Try to check it at the same time every morning and every evening.\n\nYou need to use your best effort every time you blow into the meter so you're comparing like with like and you should use the same peak flow meter every time.\n\nTake these steps to make sure you use your peak flow meter correctly.\n\nPull the counter, the red arrow, back as far as it will go, to the top, near the mouthpiece.\n\nStand or sit upright. Choose what's most comfortable for you and always do it that way.\n\nThen take the deepest breath you can and make sure your mouth makes a tight seal around the mouthpiece.\n\nThen blow as hard and as fast as you possibly can into the meter, like this.\n\nWrite down your score which is the number next to the pointer.\n\nDo this three times in a row with a short rest in between so that you get three scores.\n\nAll three readings should be roughly the same but don't worry too much if they vary. Use the highest of these scores to fill in your peak flow diary.\n\nIf you have any questions about using your peak flow meter speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. You can also call our helpline."
