        "text": "This list is regularly updated as movies rotate on and off of Prime Video. *New additions are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nAction movies are typically among the most popular films available on DVD, VOD, and streaming services. People love to tune in, tune out, and escape while watching beautiful people doing impossible things. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription and are looking to do exactly that, its vast library contains some of the best action titles ever made, alongside its comedies, horror films, and family-friendly options. Amazon cycles films on and off of its service regularly, but these are the best action movies on Prime Video right now.\n\nHow We Pick Our Films\n\nCritic Brian Tallerico watches and writes about movies and TV every day. To curate this list, he dives into Amazon Prime Video’s catalogue every month to surface exciting, white-knuckle action titles — using his taste and a lifetime of cinema study as his guide, instead of whatever the algorithm happens to be pushing. After triple-checking to make sure they’re still available, he watches each and writes his recommendation. We highlight more than just the thrilling crowdpleasers: Filmmakers use action to punctuate drama, lighten or heighten the mood of a movie, and explosively make an impact on cinema. Read on to find something to watch.\n\nApocalypto\n\nYear: 2006\n\nRuntime: 2h 17m\n\nDirector: Mel Gibson\n\nBefore he was shunned from Hollywood for being a garbage person and after he won Oscars for Braveheart, Mel Gibson directed this historical epic that has only grown in popularity in the years since its release. Casting unknown Native American and Indigenous actors, this period epic takes place in the year 1502 and tells of the journey of a hero named Jaguar Paw as his people are captured. A massive hit at the time, it’s only become a bigger one through cable airings in the years since.\n\nThe Beekeeper\n\nYear: 2024\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: David Ayer\n\nIf you’re looking for a movie that knows how to use Jason Statham’s cool action persona, look no further than this unexpectedly fun action flick. The bald icon plays a former operative named Adam Clay who seeks revenge against the phone scam that led to a friend’s suicide. A morally conscious and viciously lethal killing machine is a perfect combination for Statham, and Jeremy Irons is having a lot of fun here too.\n\n*Face/Off\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 2h 18m\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nThere are rumors that a remake of this John Woo classic is on the horizon, so you owe it to yourself to go back and see the very high standard that project will have to meet. This is one of the best action movies of the ‘90s, a wonderfully staged blockbuster by one of the genre’s best filmmakers. And John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were near the peaks of their screen charismas as an FBI agent and terrorist who end up, well, switching faces. It’s a blast.\n\nGhost in the Shell\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 22m\n\nDirector: Mamoru Oshii\n\nOne of the most influential action films of all time is actually a cartoon in this 1995 sci-fi epic from Mamoru Oshii based on the manga of the same name. Set in 2029 (which is really not that far away), it’s the story of a cyborg agent hunting a mysterious hacker, but it’s influential because of what it says about fluid identity and its incredibly powerful visuals. Forget the ScarJo live-action version and just watch this one again.\n\nGladiator\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 2h 34m\n\nDirector: Russell Crowe\n\nThe first Best Picture winner of the new millennium was one of the most beloved period action films of all time. Russell Crowe gives his most iconic performance as a Roman general named Maximus, who watches his family murdered and his life destroyed by a vicious ruler named Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Forced into slavery, Maximus must become a gladiator, competing in arenas until he can achieve his ultimate revenge.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRuntime: 2h 58m\n\nDirector: Sergio Leone\n\nIs this Sergio Leone’s best movie? It might be. It’s arguably his most influential, changing the landscape of the Western in ways that are still being felt a half-century later. Clint Eastwood plays “The Good,” Lee Van Cleef plays “The Bad,” and Eli Wallach plays “The Ugly.” It’s even better than you remember.\n\nHard Target\n\nYear: 1993\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nDirector: John Woo\n\nThe most underrated film in the filmography of a legendary action director, Hard Target got written off as another Jean-Claude Van Damme kick-fest when it came out over three decades ago. This movie rules, a perfect blend of JCVD’s stoic persona and Woo’s flashy style. It helps to have a scenery-chewing Lance Henriksen as the villain too.\n\nThe Indiana Jones franchise\n\nYear: 1981\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nEveryone is getting cautiously excited for James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, releasing later this year. It’s the perfect time to catch up with the saga of cinema’s most beloved treasure hunter in the beloved first four (well, at least three) films in this franchise. The perfect Raiders of the Lost Ark and its three sequels are all on Prime, waiting for your marathon.\n\nInterstellar\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 2h 49m\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nThe most underrated film from the director of The Dark Knight and Oppenheimer remains this 2014 sci-fi epic, a film that’s better if you approach it as an emotional journey instead of a physical one. Matthew McConaughey gives one of the best performances of his career as an astronaut searching for a new home for mankind, and realizing all that he left behind to do so. It’s a technical marvel with some of the most striking visuals and best sound design of Nolan’s career.\n\nKing of New York\n\nYear: 1990\n\nRuntime: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Abel Ferrara\n\nThe amazing Abel Ferrara directed this crime epic that oozes with style. Three decades after its release, it’s still one of the most cited films of this kind of its era. One of the main reasons for that is the cast. Christopher Walken leads the way as the legendary drug lord Frank White, but the whole ensemble here is amazing, including Laurence Fishburne, David Caruso, Wesley Snipes, Steve Buscemi, and Giancarlo Esposito.\n\nLayer Cake\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Matthew Vaughn\n\nMatthew Vaughn’s directorial debut is the film that really proved to people that Daniel Craig was smooth enough to be James Bond. Before he was 007, he was a character known only as XXXX in this story of a London criminal who is trying to get out of the drug business and having great difficulty doing so. This low-budget flick was a massive hit on the arthouse circuit because it’s clever and oh-so-stylish.\n\n*Looper\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRuntime: 1h 58m\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nBefore he got sucked into the Star Wars machine (and then escaped it to start his own franchise in Knives Out), Rian Johnson directed one of the best sci-fi/action films of the 2010s in Looper. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a contract killer who shoots people who are sent back in time to his location. And then he meets himself. Co-starring Emily Blunt and Bruce Willis, this is an inventive genre masterpiece.\n\n*The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nYear: 2001-2003\n\nRuntime: Various\n\nDirector: Peter Jackson\n\nThe Oscar-winning franchise by Peter Jackson bounces around the streaming services with alarming regularity, now finding its way to Prime Video for an indeterminate amount of time. Watch the entire saga of Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, and the rest of the Fellowship while you can.\n\n*Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 2h 43m\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nOne of the best blockbusters of 2023 became a cautionary tale when it failed to perform to sky-high box office expectations what with Barbenheimer dominating multiplexes. It’s a shame because this is a banger of an action movie, another great installment in one of the most consistently entertaining genre franchises ever. It has finally made its streaming debut on Prime Video, a year after its theatrical release, and with plenty of time to catch up before part two.\n\nOng Bak\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Prachya Pinkaew\n\nIn 2003, action movie fans were looking for the next Jackie Chan or Jet Li and they found a martial arts superstar in Tony Jaa, who had his breakout film in Ong-Bak, the story of a Muay Thai master in a small village in Thailand who ventures to retrieve the stolen head of an ancient statue for his people. The film was a hit, producing two sequels, also both on Prime Video.\n\nRed\n\nYear: 2010\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Robert Schwentke\n\nBased on the DC comic series of the same name, this 2010 action flick was such a hit that it produced a 2013 sequel (that didn’t quite work). Why were people attracted to it? Most likely the A-list cast, which united Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, and many more in a flick about a former black-ops agent who has to get the gang back together to stop an assassin.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nYear: 1992\n\nRuntime: 1h 39m\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of it? One of the only Quentin Tarantino flicks on Prime Video right now is his first effort, a movie that announced a major new talent as much as any debut of the ‘90s. Remarkably, unlike a lot of ‘80s and ‘90s debuts, Reservoir Dogs works just as well today. It would arguably be an even bigger hit if it came out in 2024. That’s how much QT influenced the form for three decades and counting after its release.\n\nSicario\n\nYear: 2015\n\nRuntime: 2h 1m\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nDenis Villeneuve has become one of the biggest directors in the world on the back of beloved films like Blade Runner 2049 and Dune, but Sicario was really his breakthrough, a thriller about an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) who gets drawn into the war between the U.S. government and the Mexican drug cartels. Benicio Del Toro gives one of the best performances of his career here.\n\nSkyfall\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRuntime: 2h 17m\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nOne of the best James Bond movies ever made is now the centerpiece of the 5-movie arc of Daniel Craig. The actor plays 007, of course, fighting against Javier Bardem’s Raoul Silva this time around in a story that touches on the very legacy of the big screen superspy. Consistently riveting, and beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, this is top tier Bond.\n\nSpy Game\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 2h 6m\n\nDirector: Tony Scott\n\nTony Scott rules! One of the action director’s best films is this thriller that matched handsome movie star icons of different generations in Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. The younger actor plays an asset arrested by the People’s Liberation Army and set for execution unless Redford’s case officer can save the day. Of course, there’s more going on than meets the eye in this clever espionage flick that seems overdue for a reappreciation.\n\nStagecoach\n\nYear: 1939\n\nRuntime: 1h 36m\n\nDirector: John Ford\n\nIt won’t play the same as modern action movies, but this could be the gateway to classic Westerns for someone in your family. Give them the gift of a flick that really changed the genre, in no small part because it really introduced the world to a young man named John Wayne. Based on a 1937 short story by Dudley Nichols, this is the tale of a group of strangers on a stagecoach as it travels through Apache territory. It has influenced too many action films since to count them all.\n\nWonder Woman\n\nYear: 2017\n\nRuntime: 2h 15m\n\nDirector: Patty Jenkins\n\nA major chapter of the DC Universe has ended, which means we can assess what worked best. This is undeniably near the top of the list. Take the recent DCU drop to Prime to go back and check out the phenomenal and best non-Batman film in the modern DC Universe. Gal Gadot stars in the title role and really anchors what’s an old-fashioned adventure film, one that owes as much to serial action flicks of the ‘40s and ‘50s as it does to movies with Batman and Superman.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
