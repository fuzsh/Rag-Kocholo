Criminal noncitizens encountered at ports of entry are inadmissible, absent extenuating circumstances, and represent a subset of total OFO inadmissibles. U.S. Border Patrol arrests of criminal noncitizens are a subset of total apprehensions. See U.S. Border Patrol Criminal Noncitizen Statistics for a breakdown of criminal noncitizen stats by type of conviction.\n\n4 NCIC (National Crime Information Center) arrests refers to the number of CBP arrests of individuals, including U.S. citizens, who are wanted by other law enforcement agencies.\n\nAll travelers crossing the United States border are subject to CBP inspection. On rare occasions, CBP officers may search a traveler’s mobile phone, computer, camera, or other electronic devices during the inspection process. These searches have been used to identify and combat terrorist activity, child pornography, drug smuggling, human smuggling, bulk cash smuggling, human trafficking, export control violations, intellectual property rights violations and visa fraud, among other violations. Furthermore, border searches of electronic devices are often integral to determining an individual’s intentions upon entry to the United States and thus provide additional information relevant to admissibility of foreign nationals under U.S. immigration laws.\n\nCBP has established strict guidelines, above and beyond prevailing legal requirements, to ensure that these searches are exercised judiciously and responsibly and are consistent with the public trust. These guidelines are outlined in CBP’s January 2018 Directive on Border Searches of Electronic Devices. Historical statistics (FY18-FY24) are available below. To learn more, including additional statistics, visit CBP’s Border Search of Electronic Devices page.\n\nInternational Travelers Processed with Electronic Device Search\n\nMonth FY 2018 FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 FY2022 FY2023 FY2024YTD October 2,539 3,026 3,959 2,969 3,275 3,493 3,689 November 2,446 2,962 3,805 2,909 2,991 3,250 3,614 December 2,509 3,365 3,966 2,760 3,894 3,343 3,588 January 3,090 3,765 4,450 3,014 3,642 3,441 3,714 February 2,512 3,096 3,702 2,829 4,148 3,165 3,680 March 2,921 3,526 2,514 3,445 4,976 3,401 3,859 April 2,701 3,218 451 3,139 4,136 3,270 3,834 May 2,764 3,138 616 3,323 4,156 3,758 4,317 June 2,606 3,480 1,149 3,150 3,746 3,434 3,439 July 2,798 3,458 2,047 3,244 3,524 3,333 August 3,320 4,085 2,614 3,425 3,486 4,051 September 3,090 3,794 2,765 3,243 3,525 3,628 Total 33,296 40,913 32,038 37,450 45,499 41,567 33,734\n\nThis table provides a summary of OFO encounters of all persons at ports of entry with records within the TSDS at the time of their encounter.\n\nData Set Encounters FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24YTD Office of Field Operations TSDS Encounters at Land Border Ports of Entry of All Nationalities* Southwest Border 116 155 280 72 103 67 80 32 Northern Border 217 196 258 124 54 313 484 233 Total 333 351 538 196 157 380 564 265 U.S. Border Patrol TSDS Encounters Between Ports of Entry of Non-U.S. Citizens Southwest Border 2 6 0 3 15 98 169 93 Northern Border 0 0 3 0 1 0 3 1 Total 2 6 3 3 16 98 172 94 Percentage of Total USBP Encounters 0.0007% 0.0015% 0.0004% 0.0007% 0.0010% 0.0044% 0.0083% 0.0068%\n\nThis table provides a summary of USBP encounters of non-U.S. citizens with records within the TSDS at the time of their encounter between U.S. ports of entry.\n\nThe Terrorist Screening Dataset (TSDS) – also known as the “watchlist” – is the U.S. government’s database that contains sensitive information on terrorist identities. The TSDS originated as the consolidated terrorist watchlist to house information on known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) but has evolved over the last decade to include additional individuals who represent a potential threat to the United States, including known affiliates of watchlisted individuals.\n\nEncounters of watchlisted individuals at our borders are very uncommon, underscoring the critical work CBP Agents and Officers carry out every day on the frontlines. DHS works tirelessly to secure our borders through a combination of highly trained personnel, ground and aerial monitoring systems, and robust intelligence and information sharing networks.\n\nTSDS watchlisted non-citizens encountered by the CBP Office of Field Operations at land ports of entry prior to entry into the United States may be denied admission to our country upon presentation, barring justification for their arrest under CBP policy. TSDS watchlisted individuals encountered by the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) after entering the country without inspection may be detained and removed, to the extent possible under CBP policy, or turned over to another government agency for subsequent detention or law enforcement action, as appropriate.\n\n* POE totals may include multiple encounters of the same individual.\n\nRecidivism percentages are updated at the end of each fiscal year.\n\nFY FY 15 FY 16 FY 17 FY 18 FY 19 FY 20 FY21 Recidivism5 14% 12% 10% 11% 7% 26% 27%\n\n5 Recidivism refers to percentage of individuals apprehended more than one time by the Border Patrol within a fiscal year. Beginning in March FY20, USBP encounters statistics and recidivism calculations include both Title 8 Apprehensions and Title 42 Expulsions. To learn more, visit Title-8-and-Title-42-Statistics. Apprehensions refers to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest."
