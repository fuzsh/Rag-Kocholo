        "text": "Shelby Lynne has a new album coming out, “Consequences of the Crown,” and that seems to be as much of a surprise to her as to anyone.\n\nIt’s not that she ever gave up on music. It’s just that she’d reached a point where she thought her time as a recording artist had passed. And there was no shame in that, given the scope of her career. After leaving Mobile for Nashville in the late ‘80s, she skirted the edges of mainstream country success with a handful of albums. Then she threw off mainstream country convention, moved to California and recorded a Grammy-winning set of pop soul, “I Am Shelby Lynne.” Then over the next 20 years she released about a dozen more albums that ranged from more pop soul to Americana to stark singer-songwriter material to a Christmas album to a Dusty Springfield tribute. Not to mention “Not Dark Yet,” a joint project with her sister Allison Moorer.\n\nShe never matched the commercial success of “I Am Shelby Lynne,” but she maintained critical respect and a loyal fan base. She had a lot of laurels to rest on.\n\nIn the last few years she moved back to Nashville, got her heart broken and met some new musical allies – notably Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town – who convinced her that the world needed to hear more Shelby Lynne music. “Consequences of the Crown,” due for release Aug. 16 by Monument Records, is the result. Fairchild produced, along with Lynne, singer-songwriter Ashley Monroe, and Grammy-winning engineer Gena Johnson. Fans have already heard a few of the tracks, including “Butterfly,” Lynne’s tribute to her sister.\n\nSome tracks show kinship to the soulful harmonies of “I Am Shelby Lynne,” but the album is dominated by the heartbreak Lynne processes in its songs. As always, she brings a striking directness to her words and her emotions. Her ability to cut down to the bone is as sharp as ever.\n\nWith the release approaching, Lynne took some time to talk about the surprise project. The following has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWe’ve got a lot to talk about, but first off, what brought you back to Nashville after all this time?\n\nShelby Lynne: Well, I just wanted to be closer to my sister. I mean, we’ve spent a lot of years apart and we finally are in a place where we can live close to each other, which has always been our dream. So that was the main thing. And I had been living the last seven years in Los Angeles and I just had enough. I am a Southerner and I just wanted to be back. I just wanted to be back in the South.\n\nSince you’ve been back, what stands out as far as changes or annoyances or pleasant surprises?\n\nWell, I don’t really think about things that bug me because I would be taking up all my time. … You know, when I left in ‘98 it was a little bit of a different Nashville. Now it’s a huge metropolis and there’s anything you can possibly imagine. When I left there was about two good restaurants and three hotels and now everywhere you look, there’s a restaurant or another hotel going up. I mean, it’s still growing and growing. But I found myself a nice little place and I’m happy to be here.\n\nThe only thing that’s taken me a minute to get used to, but you hop right back in there, is the humidity. California doesn’t have any.\n\nNashville is known for a very active songwriting scene where writers partner up in sessions, often with the idea that resulting songs will be pitched to pop or country stars, and in retrospect it makes perfect sense for you to jump in. But I’ve always thought of you as a solo creator, and I didn’t see it coming.\n\nI had not either. I was just, I always concentrated on being a singer, you know, and writing songs for myself. I had never collaborated for songs to pitch to anyone else or anything like that. I’ve always written songs. But I always thought they were just going to be for me. So, it’s been a different experience, you know, writing songs that weren’t specific for an album for myself.\n\nI also learned a lot about myself. It’s like, “Well, we were writing this for someone else, but I like it.” So, there’s lots of surprises that come with just being a songwriter and collaborating. It doesn’t have anything to do with you as an artist. It’s really fun.\n\nKaren Fairchild obviously is a big part of this. How did the two of you come together as collaborators?\n\nWe started writing songs together. I was writing with Ashley Monroe and Waylon Payne and Angaleena Presley, who, you know, they’re Pistol Annies, and I was just getting to know them. Because I came back to Nashville, I just wanted to write some songs, you know, kind of settle into a quiet life. [Note: Monroe and Presley have recorded with Miranda Lambert as the Pistol Annies; singer-songwriter Payne is the son of late country singer Sammi Smith and longtime Willie Nelson guitarist Jody Payne, a well-known figure on the Baldwin County music scene until his death in 2013. Waylon Payne posted several years ago on Instagram that “When I was in my 20’s and fresh to Nashville, Shelby Lynne took me in, fed me, and helped me find my own voice as a songwriter. She was and remains one of my heroes- and one of my closest friends.”]\n\nI didn’t really have any plans on making any record. Karen came over to write one day and she goes, “We need another record.” I’m like, oh, I’m just kind of not fooling with that anymore. And I said, “I think my time’s passed,” and she said, “No, we need a record.” So, I have to tell everyone that it’s all because of Karen. So that’s basically it. She came over to write songs and we became best friends after admiring each other from afar all these years.\n\nWhen you decided to do the album, was there a concept you started with or was it just that a body of songs began to build up that seemed to hang together?\n\nOh, it was written out of heartbreak. Every single word of it. I made the mistake of falling in love when I moved back to Nashville and then it didn’t work out and it crushed me. So that’s what I write about, what I know. This time was I had collaborators that did it with me. And that’s the difference.\n\nI mean, I already write about what I know. And it makes for great songs, your busted-up heart. But you know what? It has to happen, I think. I’m pretty lucky, when I get broken I can write about it and share.\n\nThe album opens with a piece that’s partly spoken, partly sung, “Truth We Know.” It depicts the dawning realization a relationship is over. It’s unconventional, it’s stark, and it lets people know right up front that you’re going to do what you feel like doing on this. Tell me about the decision to put that right up front because I’m sure that wasn’t taken lightly.\n\nIt’s kind of like the opening act of what’s to follow. That was done live on the mic, a sketch of the “Truth We Know.” Ashley had this beautiful music and I thought, “Let me just get on the mic with this,” and it turned into what it is. It was all live on the mic and all emotional experience.\n\nThere was nowhere else to put it. We did it kind of in the beginning, but we did have other songs recorded at that point. But we knew it was a great opener because it was so honest and so brutally painful. It was just, there was no other way to open the record.\n\nI’m a sucker for whenever an artist decides not to make a song fit the standard template. When somebody says I only need this verse, I don’t need two other verses, or this song is going to be a minute long or whatever. I love it when people just throw away the playbook and you do it right up front in this case. It really creates some headroom; it puts people on notice that this project is coming from a very specific space.\n\nYes, sir. That’s it. And it’s important to me, to be as broken as the words and the music represent, because it’s all real to me. You know, I still have a problem listening to that song. I get choked up because it just comes from such an honest place of being so busted and so broken emotionally. I just, I go right back there. But I’m healing up better and just running through it. Every song has to do with that pain. So, I can’t help it. I just bear it, let it out.\n\nWe get another dose of that on “Gone to Bed.” It’s the middle of the night, you can’t sleep, you’re just standing over the kitchen sink muttering to yourself – and then you’re singing. That’s such a raw track. It’s like, sometimes as a person you wonder if you can do what it is that you do. You have a moment where you just don’t know if you’ve got it in you. And this really sounds like a moment where Shelby Lynne is just standing there thinking, “I don’t know if I can do this,” and then you take a few steps and you’re flying, you’re doing what Shelby Lynne does.\n\n“Gone to Bed” just kind of happened to the four of us as we were in the studio. … Things happen and it was really exciting, and it was really inspiring to be around the girls and have some partners that understood the pain and understood because they had really seen me at my birth. It was like, picking each other up, and they really held me.\n\nWay back in 2003 we talked about your album “Identity Crisis.” It was the first album you produced for yourself, and you told me you’d enjoyed working on it at your own pace, developing it piece by piece into a finished project before you brought it to the label that released it. But you said that prior to that, in the early part of your career, you’d been averse to experimenting in the studio. You wanted to arrive knowing exactly what you were there to do, anything else was a waste of time and money. So, when you talk about discovering things in the studio, it seems like the continuation of a long creative arc.\n\nWe did a lot of that. The experience was free. I’m sure when I told you that [about the early part of her career] I was trapped in a situation of being told what to do about some producer, this, that or the other. There was none of that this time because the four of us got together, shut up in a place, and really inspired each other through my experience with being brokenhearted. It just kind of happened that way.\n\nThe four of us are truly the queens that wear the crown and that’s the way we treated each other and how friendship works with the collaborators you have. That was how the title came about, the four of us kidding around calling each other “queen” all the time.\n\nThe songs are chapters in a year and a half of my travels and my journey. It was a perfect fit. What I believe is that nothing happens until it’s supposed to and there’s no need in trying to fix it or put it in place. It just happens if it’s supposed to.\n\nI should mention the album is not all the downside of being heartbroken. It’s about working through it and being renewed and redeemed. “Dear God” is particularly a song where that comes through. Talk a little bit about the redemptive side of this music.\n\nI thank you for noticing that because it truly is. When we go from the “Truth We Know” and we go through all the pain and then by the time we get to “Dear God” it is about forgiving myself and thanking God for giving me another chance.\n\nIt’s like [there are] so many mistakes I’ve made in a long lot of time, and I’ve finally gotten around to learning the reasons why, at least some of them. I feel really blessed to be here at all, and then to be able to make the record and have another chance at a career is just a mind-blowing experience, really, truly, honestly.\n\nThis one was especially painful and I’m really glad that the girls were with me, and I couldn’t have done it without them.\n\nIn “Regular Man” there’s a line about “a regular man doing regular things” that I think you could take about a thousand different ways about the behavior men get up to, foolish or destructive or honorable or whatever. There’s a complexity to the way it looks at human nature, sad but understanding.\n\nThe song “Regular Man,” I wrote about drunks. It’s about drunks. The first verse is about my falling in love with [name omitted] that I made records with years ago. He’s dead now, so I can say that he was a terrible drunk. The second verse is about my own drunkenness. I don’t drink anymore, but that’s who the second verse is about. And then the third verse is about my daddy who was also a notorious drunk. … That’s basically what it’s about. It’s about, every walk of life can be one.\n\nAs you come out with this album, there’s been a lot of fanfare around the 25th anniversary of “I Am Shelby Lynne.” There are some songs where you can hear a kinship to that album, not like you’re trying to recreate that, but you get a sense of things coming from a similar space. So, tell me your thoughts on that.\n\nI would get inklings of feeling that when we were making the record. “Clouds” reminds me a little bit of “I Am.” “Regular Man” does too, you know, I guess the more, Americana-type songs are akin to the “I Am” record.\n\nBut, you know, the “I Am” record came from such an honest place, too. It was a more geographical record because I lived in Alabama and “Where I’m From” [reflected] the love of that. The intensity of the subject matter is the same. I have to say I was broken then, when I made that record, and I was broken making this one. So maybe that’s part of what the similarities are.\n\nIs there anything you would just like folks to know about where you’re at these days or, or about the album in particular?\n\nWell, I’m very grateful for it because I certainly had no expectation. I just came to write some songs and have a quiet life and here I am doing a record again.\n\nI have to say I recently went to Birmingham to visit some friends and I saw the 205 area code pop up and I thought, oh, I’m kind of Jonesin’ for an Alabama address. I’m looking for a lake somewhere."
