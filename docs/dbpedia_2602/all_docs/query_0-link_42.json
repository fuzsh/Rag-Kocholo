        "text": "A quiet curse is haunting Auburn women’s basketball.\n\nIt struck again Thursday.\n\nAfter an electric win over defending national champion LSU on Sunday, Auburn suffered a let-down loss to Vanderbilt — and you could call it J.A.B.A. and to a degree you’d be right.\n\nNine times in a row now, when Auburn women’s basketball has beaten a ranked team, it has seen its momentum come screeching to a halt with a loss in the following game. It’s been since 2010 that Auburn followed a ranked win with another victory: a seemingly insane stat, but it’s true.\n\nNo, all is not lost. Auburn can recapture some of that momentum this upcoming Sunday when the Tigers host rival Alabama. Johnnie Harris and her team will be working to do just that, and the admirable die-hard fans will be doing their part, too.\n\nWill you?\n\nThat’s my question, because these losses have been happening since long before Harris got here.\n\nHere’s the list:\n\nRanked win: No. 7 LSU — W, 67-62 — Jan. 14, 2024\n\nFollowing game: Vanderbilt — L, 53-50 — Jan. 18, 2024\n\nRanked win: No. 4 Tennessee — W, 71-61 — Jan. 27, 2022\n\nFollowing game: Vanderbilt — L, 81-66 — Jan. 30, 2022\n\nRanked win: No. 18 Georgia Tech — W, 59-51 — Nov. 21, 2021\n\nFollowing game: Little Rock — L, 57-49 — Nov. 24, 2021\n\nRanked win: No. 25 Missouri — W, 58-54 — Feb. 24, 2019\n\nFollowing game: No. 14 South Carolina — L, 73-66 — Feb. 28, 2019\n\nRanked win: No. 16 Florida — W, 80-58 — Feb. 14, 2016\n\nFollowing game: Missouri — L, 69-55 — Feb. 21, 2016\n\nRanked win: No. 7 Kentucky — W, 66-61 — Jan. 3, 2016\n\nFollowing game: No. 6 Mississippi State — L, 60-45 — Jan. 7, 2016\n\nRanked win: No. 16 Vanderbilt — W, 68-62 — Feb. 13, 2014\n\nFollowing game: Missouri — L, 68-58 — Feb. 16, 2014\n\nRanked win: No. 23 Arkansas — W, 50-47 — Jan. 3, 2013\n\nFollowing game: Missouri — L, 82-76 — Jan. 6, 2013\n\nRanked win: No. 22 Georgia — W, 63-58 — Feb. 24, 2011\n\nFollowing game: No. 20 Kentucky — L, 76-62 — Feb. 27, 2011\n\nThe last time Auburn capitalized on the momentum of a ranked win with a second win was in spring 2010. Auburn closed the regular season beating No. 16 Kentucky 65-53 then won in the first round of the SEC Tournament against Florida 74-61. But even in that season, Auburn won a game over No. 9 Georgia then promptly lost to unranked South Carolina. It happened under Nell Fortner and it happened under Terri Williams-Flournoy.\n\nA few of those are unlucky scheduling: There’s no shame to losing to ranked South Carolina in 2019 or ranked Mississippi State in 2016. Those teams made the Sweet Sixteen those years. But all told it’s a pattern, and just changing staffs every few seasons hasn’t fixed it.\n\nHow do you get out of the cycle? How does Auburn do something to shake things up and make Auburn a women’s basketball destination, the way it was last Sunday?\n\nMy suggestion is the same as it has been: To take matters into your own hands. To pack that arena often, to create an atypical environment in women’s basketball, win or lose, because you know the wins would follow. Become a “have” instead of a “have-not” — make Auburn that weird place on everybody’s schedule where they pack it out and The Jungle is rowdy just because they can be.\n\nThere’s a few things that could happen: You can sit around and wait until some wunderkind player decides they want to play here and build a program from next to nothing, which is out of your control, you can sit around and wait until maybe the NCAA moves women’s basketball to the summer so it isn’t competing with the men for people’s attention, which is unlikely and also out of your control, or there’s action. You could give Auburn one more pitch on the recruiting trail, if it has an unusually strong crowd for women’s basketball regularly.\n\nSure, it helps when the team wins all their games. Dawn Staley is the most qualified person to talk about building a program out of nothing, and she said in a media interview once that you do it in steps, tit for tat, give and take: You win some games and more people come, which helps you win more games, which helps you bring more people, which helps you win more games, which helps you bring more people.\n\nThat’s the cycle you want to be in. How does it start? Chicken or the egg? Either wait until wins come out of nowhere, or be that first jump-start in the stands.\n\nStaley’s right — of course she’s right. I’m under no illusion that you need to present an exciting product to attract tens of thousands of fans, but even in the old days when Auburn was going to Final Fours under Joe Ciampi, Auburn’s attendance numbers topped 6,000 only three times in those days.\n\nSunday’s attendance of 7,720 was the second-largest home crowd for women’s basketball recorded in Auburn history. The largest was 12,067, a showing to be proud of, DeWanna Bonner vs. Pat Summitt — but looking at the record book, the fans seemed to leave then as quick as they came.\n\nIt’s no poor reflection on Auburn or indictment on Auburn fans — but it is an opportunity. Pick yourself a non-revenue sport. Go to some games you wouldn’t normally go to. It could be basketball or it could be anything. Stick through some tough losses. It’s good for ya. It’s a good way to spend your time, a good hobby, and a rewarding one. You could be that like fan last Sunday, tears of joy welling in their eyes watching their team through thick and thin finally get its moment in the sun.\n\nYou could be just like that fan one day, and you could be sitting right next to them this Sunday, too, if you want.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nJustin Lee\n\nSports Editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
