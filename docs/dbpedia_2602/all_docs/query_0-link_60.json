        "text": "A dry cough can have many causes, from allergies to viruses. Home remedies and medications may help provide relief. Drinking plenty of water and avoiding allergens or environmental irritants can also be beneficial.\n\nA cough is a reflex action that clears your airway of irritants and mucus.\n\nThere are two types of cough: productive and nonproductive. A productive cough produces phlegm or mucus, clearing it from the lungs. A nonproductive cough, known as a dry cough, doesn’t produce phlegm or mucus.\n\nMany things — from allergies to acid reflux — can cause a dry cough. In some cases, there’s no obvious cause.\n\nAn ongoing dry cough can seriously impact your day-to-day life, especially if it’s worse at night. Keep reading to learn more about the possible causes of a dry cough and ways to find relief.\n\nAsthma\n\nAsthma is a condition in which your airways swell and become narrow. Asthma-related coughs can be productive and nonproductive, though they’re frequently nonproductive.\n\nCoughing is a common symptom of asthma, but it’s usually not the most prominent one. However, there is a type of asthma called cough variant asthma that includes a chronic dry cough as its main symptom.\n\nOther symptoms of asthma can include:\n\nwheezing\n\nshortness of breath\n\ntightness or pain in the chest\n\ntrouble sleeping because of wheezing or coughing\n\ncoughing or wheezing attacks\n\nLong-term asthma treatment often involves long-acting medications like inhaled corticosteroids, such as:\n\nfluticasone (Flonase, Flovent)\n\ntriamcinolone (Azmacort)\n\nbudesonide (Pulmicort)\n\nShort-acting medications for occasional asthma attacks include bronchodilator inhalers such as albuterol (Proventil, Ventoline). These can also be part of a long-term treatment plan.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a type of chronic acid reflux. It happens when stomach acid regularly flows back up into your esophagus, which connects your mouth to your stomach.\n\nStomach acid can irritate your esophagus and trigger your cough reflex.\n\nOther symptoms of GERD include:\n\nheartburn\n\nchest pain\n\nregurgitation of food or sour liquid\n\nthe feeling of a lump in the back of the throat\n\nchronic sore throat\n\nmild hoarseness\n\ndifficulty swallowing\n\nMost people find relief from GERD through a combination of lifestyle changes and over-the-counter (OTC) acid reducers such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid).\n\nSome home remedies may also help treat acid reflux and GERD.\n\nPostnasal drip\n\nPostnasal drip refers to extra mucus dripping down your throat.\n\nWhen you have a cold or seasonal allergies, the membranes in your nose respond by producing more mucus than usual. Unlike healthy mucus, this mucus is watery and runny, so it drips easily down the back of your throat.\n\nPostnasal drip can tickle the nerves in the back of your throat, triggering a cough.\n\nOther symptoms of postnasal drip include:\n\nsore throat\n\nthe feeling of a lump in the back of the throat\n\ntrouble swallowing\n\nrunny nose\n\ncoughing at night\n\nThe treatment for postnasal drip will depend on what’s causing it. It’s usually the result of allergies, a bacterial infection, or a virus.\n\nRegardless of the underlying cause, steam from a hot shower or teapot can help clear your sinuses. A saline nasal spray or neti pot can help flush out extra mucus.\n\nViral infection\n\nWhen you contract one of the many viruses that cause the common cold, your short-term symptoms usually last less than a week. It’s not uncommon, however, for a cough to linger long after your other symptoms have improved.\n\nThese post-cold coughs are usually dry and last up to 2 months. They’re usually the result of irritation in your airway, which is often overly sensitive after a viral illness.\n\nThis type of cough is difficult to treat and often requires time and patience. Coughing only increases the irritation in your airway, so try using throat lozenges and warm liquids to soothe your throat. This may help you cough less, giving your airway a chance to heal.\n\nUpper respiratory infection\n\nAn acute upper respiratory infection (URI) is a virus or bacteria that infects your nose, throat, pharynx, larynx, and bronchi.\n\nIn addition to the common cold, URIs include:\n\nsinusitis\n\npharyngitis\n\ntracheobronchitis\n\nThe common symptoms of a URI include:\n\ncoughing\n\nrunny nose\n\nnasal congestion\n\nsneezing\n\nYou can treat coughing caused by a URI with cough suppressants and expectorants.\n\nAllergies\n\nWhen your immune system mistakes a harmless foreign substance, such as pollen, for something dangerous to your body, it attacks it. This causes allergy symptoms such as coughing.\n\nSeasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, are triggered by plant pollen. These types of allergies are common, affecting more than 19 million Americans.\n\nBesides coughing, symptoms may include itchy or watery eyes and a runny nose.\n\nSeasonal allergy symptoms may last as long as you are exposed to the allergen. If OTC allergy medications aren’t relieving your symptoms, you should see a doctor.\n\nEnvironmental irritants\n\nMany things in the air can irritate your airways, including smoke, pollution, dust, mold, and pollen. Chemical particles, such as sulfur dioxide or nitric oxide, can also cause concerns.\n\nEven clean air that’s too dry or too cold can cause a dry cough for some people. If you live in a dry climate, try using a humidifier to add some moisture to the air in your home.\n\nACE inhibitors\n\nACE inhibitors, such as enalapril (Vasotec) and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), are prescription drugs that treat many common conditions, including high blood pressure.\n\nOne of the most common side effects of ACE inhibitors is a chronic dry cough. About 20 percent of people taking ACE inhibitors experience a dry cough.\n\nWhooping cough\n\nWhooping cough, which is also called pertussis, is a very contagious condition that causes a severe dry cough. It’s followed up by a high-pitched “whoop” sound when you breathe in.\n\nIt can be easily confused for a common cold in its early stages. However, it eventually causes uncontrollable coughing fits.\n\nWhooping cough was a common childhood disease, but now most children are vaccinated against it. Today, it’s more common in children too young to have completed their vaccinations or in teens and adults whose immunity has decreased over time.\n\nCollapsed lung\n\nA collapsed lung, or pneumothorax, happens when your lung suddenly deflates. It can happen either on its own or in response to a chest injury. It’s more common in people with underlying lung disease.\n\nIn addition to a dry cough, a collapsed lung can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath.\n\nLung cancer\n\nWhile it’s not likely, sometimes an ongoing dry cough can be a sign of lung cancer.\n\nA cough related to lung cancer usually doesn’t go away, and it might change over time. For example, your cough might become more painful or have a different sound.\n\nOther possible symptoms of lung cancer include:\n\ncoughing up blood, even a small amount\n\nshortness of breath\n\nchest pain\n\nwheezing\n\nhoarseness\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\nSeek medical attention if any of the above symptoms accompanies your dry cough. This is especially important if you smoke or have a family history of lung cancer.\n\nHeart failure\n\nHeart failure happens when your heart muscle doesn’t pump blood as well as it should. It’s more common in people with conditions like coronary artery disease and high blood pressure, which can decrease your heart’s ability to pump blood effectively.\n\nA persistent, dry cough is one symptom of heart failure. However, it can also cause a cough that produces foamy white or pink-tinted mucus.\n\nOther symptoms of heart failure include:\n\nshortness of breath that may be sudden or severe\n\nfatigue and weakness\n\nrapid or irregular heartbeat\n\nswelling in your legs, ankles, and feet\n\nlack of appetite or nausea\n\nabdominal swelling\n\nfluid retention\n\ntrouble concentrating\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n\nThe rare condition idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) stiffens and scars the tissues in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.\n\nIn addition to shortness of breath, IPF may cause symptoms such as a chronic cough, weakness, and weight loss.\n\nIPF progresses slowly. There is no cure, but it can be treated with medications and oxygen therapy to help with breathing and reduce lung inflammation. As a final treatment step, a lung transplant may be necessary"
