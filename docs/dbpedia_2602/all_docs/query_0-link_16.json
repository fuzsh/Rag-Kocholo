        "text": "3.2. DFUs as a cause of work absenteeism or incapacity\n\nParticipants also discussed how the challenges of managing their DFU led to work absenteeism and reduced their ability to resume the full range of regular work activities. For many, the lengthy healing process, the need to offload, and declines in ambulatory function significantly impacted their ability to work. One participant was concerned with their job security due to the amount of time they would be off work and the uncertainty of returning to their place of employment.\n\n“I said, my job is still working, waiting this year. You know, how long this is going to be? I have not discussed anything that we talked about the fact that I may not be returning. Or if I do, it’s going to be a different capacity, I suppose. But that’s, in my mind. I think that’s not something to discuss, because I really don’t know. The only thing I know for sure, as my surgeon said, I would be off my feet for two months. Right out of the hospital. So that is what I’ve told my work.”\n\nAnother participant echoed the sentiment regarding the extensive timeframe for their DFU to heal.\n\n“Like I said, work, activities, down time … yeah, it was several months, I think it went for like 7-8 months … I was not too thrilled about that.”\n\nFor some participants, offloading not only affected their ability to work, but also resulted in emotional stress. Patients expressed frustration with not being able to work.\n\n“I’m not working right now, but I wish [I] was.”\n\nOne participant talked about limited mobility and not being able to engage in physical activity which is recommended for diabetes self-management due to having to offload for their DFU.\n\n“I get ulcers every now and then because it’s hard to offload the foot. And because I have an open sore, I can’t go swimming, I can’t go for walks when I want to, you know? I try not to dwell on it because it is what it is.”\n\nParticipants who were employed were met with deciding in what capacity they would return to the workforce.\n\nThis participant told us their doctor suggested they would not be able to return to their previous employment that required them to be on their feet a lot.\n\n“When it comes to work … I think it’s best that you start thinking about changing what you do … I was like, why? am I going to be in a wheelchair? Am I going to be on with a cane? Am I not able to stand [up]? I will not be able to spend the amount of hours I’ve spent in the past on my feet.”\n\nAnother participant contemplated making a career change working fewer hours in a day/week that would be advantageous for DFU prevention/management and overall quality of life but also considered the economic consequences to their family of such a decision.\n\n“I’ve been thinking of getting out of the business, prior to this going on. I’ve talked about it for years (laugh). I’m at the age now that, you know, I have a son [and] a wife, and I never see him based on my hours. And I’ve talked and talked about trying to find a different kind of job that would allow that to happen. I guess, for lack of a better word, a more normal hour type job eight hours a day, you know, 40 hours a week, which I’ve never worked in my life, it’s always been 65 hours or up. And so, when this happened when I went into the hospital prior to knowledge of what, where I’d be right now, I’d mentioned to my wife that maybe this is this is a time to make that adjustment to find a different job. You know, the pay I make is pretty substantial. I make great money where I’m at. And we’ve always known that if I make a job change, it’s not going to be the same. I mean, maybe there’s a chance that I can find something [else], but most likely [not, because of] Corona [COVID-19].\n\nA couple of participants discussed absenteeism as entrepreneurs. These participants were either the primary or sole operator of their business. There were no paid leave benefits to cover time off resulting in loss wages. One participant recalled feeling conflicted over deciding to stay home and offload to allow the DFU to heal or to go to work and maintain their income.\n\n“…had a big impact on my work. I’m self-employed so if I’m not working then I don’t get paid. I don’t have [a regular salary], you know what I mean. So that was pretty hard to stay home”\n\nThis participant, who underwent an emergency minor amputation, expressed how concerned they were for their small business’ survival after being unexpectantly shut down for months.\n\n“I came to work, I put a note on my door that said that I would be opening at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, because I figured that would give me plenty of time [to get back]. And four months later, I came and unlocked the door…”"
