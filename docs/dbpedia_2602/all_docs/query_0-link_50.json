        "text": "Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory condition, not simply as a lipid storage disease, where cells from both innate and adaptive immunity are involved in its pathogenesis [1]. Instead, inflammation is involved in the majority of atherosclerosis stages, starting from the initial recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells, the formation and progression of plaques, to the eventual rupture of the latter, leading to thrombotic-related complications [2]. The initial stage of atherosclerosis is primarily mediated by the activation, dysfunction, and structural changes of endothelial cells. This activation can be potentially triggered by routine habits, such as smoking and high saturated-fat diet, as well as the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. The initial phase of atherosclerosis is mediated by the subendothelial accumulation of lipid molecules, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which will undergo oxidation by free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative enzymes like lipoxygenases. This would eventually stimulate the expression of various chemokines, for example, C-C motif ligand 2, and different adhesion molecules, including E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The expression of these adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in particular, leads to the adhesion of innate (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) and adaptive (T lymphocytes) immune cells as well as activated thrombocytes to the endothelium. While interacting with other leukocytes, activated thrombocytes secrete more cytokines in order to further establish immune cell infiltration. For example, monocytes penetrate the tunica intima of the vascular wall through diapedesis, where they differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells. In the same context, macrophages will engulf the modified lipoprotein molecules, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol esters, thus becoming foam cells.\n\nOn the other hand, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been shown to give rise to plaque macrophages and foam cells. Rong et al. [3] provided the first demonstration of the acquisition by mouse aortic VSMCs of macrophage-like features after they were cholesterol loaded in vitro. The authors demonstrated that these cholesterol-loaded VSMC foam cells not only had downregulation of contractile markers (ACTA2 and MYH11) but also possessed upregulation of key macrophage and phagocytosis marker genes (CD68 and Lgals3). Later on, ex vivo approaches using co-staining for cell-specific markers revealed the phenotype conversion of VSMCs of the human coronary artery to a macrophage-like state during human atherogenesis [4]. By quantifying VSMC foam cells in human coronary lesions, the authors showed that they contribute to up to 50% of total foam cells. Additional in vivo studies using the combination of single cell RNA sequencing and VSMC lineage tracing also showed that VSMCs can transdifferentiate, express pro-inflammatory cytokines, and perform phagocytosis [5, 6], and that the contribution of VSMCs within atherosclerotic plaques has been greatly underestimated since they contribute up to 80% of total foam cells in advanced atherosclerosis [7]. Overall, these data demonstrate the involvement of VSMCs in the lipid uptake and formation of foam cells. It is worth noting that in addition to VSMCs, intimal pericytes are also involved in lipid accumulation and the formation of foam cells (reviewed in [8]).\n\nMacrophages multiply, releasing various growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that occasionally mediate monocytic/T-cellular infiltration in addition to amplifying pro-inflammatory signals. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma, interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as various anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, and family members of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), and growth differentiation factors, have been reported to be released by activated macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques [9]. Moreover, the progressive accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis [10], while the compromised clearance of apoptotic debris triggers cell necrosis that will further amplify plaque inflammation [11]. Finally, inflammation is directly associated with the formation of a thinner fibrous cap through impeding the integrity of the interstitial collagen matrix, by inhibiting VSMCs to form new collagen fibers, or by promoting the destruction of already existing collagen fibers [12-14].\n\nIt is well known that cell necrosis is a potent inducer of pathological calcification [49]. In fact, calcifying dead macrophages in the necrotic core are often where microcalcifications initiate in human coronary arteries [21]. Extracellular concentrations of calcium and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are close to those that cause spontaneous precipitation in many biological fluids. Hence, calcification is constantly inhibited by the production of extracellular inhibitors, such as inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) or matrix Gla protein (MGP). Genetic deficiency in MGP, or in ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1, an enzyme generating PPi from extracellular adenosine triphosphate, results in spontaneous vascular calcification [50, 51]. Inside living cells, calcium and phosphate ions are normally physically separated to prevent the precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals. While calcium is stored in the ER and mitochondria, inorganic phosphate (Pi) is mainly located in the cytoplasm where calcium levels are very low [52]. This separation is normally preserved during apoptosis, during which apoptotic bodies that are phagocytosed by macrophages are not calcified. However, when apoptotic body clearance is delayed, apoptotic cells and bodies undergo secondary necrosis during which membranes can break allowing calcium and Pi to interact and precipitate. It is well known that compromised macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies is a hallmark of atherosclerosis plaques [11], which might significantly contribute to the formation of early microcalcifications [21]. Finally, not only the release of Pi but also organic phosphates might also participate in initiation of plaque calcification [53]. The release of DNA in particular could be involved in microcalcification induced by cell necrosis [54].\n\nIn addition, a form of programmed cell necrosis, called necroptosis, has recently emerged [55] and has been shown to profoundly modulate the development of atherosclerotic plaques [56-58]. The main proteins controlling this form of cell death are receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 [55]. When activated, RIPK3 phosphorylates mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein, which triggers MLKL oligomerization, membrane translocation, and formation of a pore allowing the extracellular release of intracellular molecules [59]. MLKL is phosphorylated in advanced but not early human atherosclerotic plaques [58], indicating that necroptosis is effective in advanced human plaque development. Among the different cell types present in plaques and potentially affected by necroptosis, macrophages have been focused in most studies. Macrophage necroptosis is induced in vitro by oxidized LDL and caspase inhibitors [56, 58], and in vivo Ripk3 deletion reduces the number of necrotic macrophages in plaques of ApoE-deficient mice [56]. To our knowledge, whether macrophage necroptosis is associated with plaque calcification has not been addressed specifically, and it was tempting to speculate that necroptosis induces and/or exacerbates calcification by releasing Pi through MLKL pores. However, the contribution of macrophage necroptosis to plaque development, including calcification and inflammation, might be much more complex than anticipated and difficult to characterize. Surprisingly enough, Ripk3 deletion specifically in macrophages resulted in increased atherosclerotic plaque size [60]. The authors suspected that RIPK3 plays additional roles than promoting necroptosis and particularly anti-inflammatory functions explaining the increased lesion development. Additional studies are therefore warranted to have a clearer view of necroptosis impact and its effects on calcification.\n\nThe evolution from a disorganized, pro-inflammatory tissue containing apatite crystals toward building a new mineralized tissue may not only occur in atherosclerosis plaques but also in the bone after a fracture. Indeed, fracture healing initiates with an early inflammatory phase, which takes place just after the fracture, and is necessary to induce ossification thereafter [117]. Absence of TNF-α in particular delays ossification [118], in part by delaying chondrocyte differentiation [119]. Interestingly, TNF-α may act mainly through BMP2 since TNF-α stimulates BMP2 expression in chondrocytes [120] and endothelial cells [121], and since the absence of BMP2 blocks fracture healing in its early steps [122]. Therefore, it is possible that the inflammatory effects of apatite crystals in atherosclerosis plaques are necessary to generate osteochondrocyte-like cells that will produce large mineralized surfaces allowing plaque stabilization. The recent histological study in human carotids published by Montanaro et al. [28] suggests that TGF-β expressed by M2 macrophages may also link the resolution of inflammation to the differentiation of osteochondrocyte-like cells and the growth of macrocalcifications. Therefore, M1 macrophages may participate in the vicious cycle linking microcalcification to inflammation, whereas M2 macrophages may contribute to terminate this cycle and allow plaque repair through ossification. The localization of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques supports this hypothesis. The pro-inflammatory M1 cells are located in unstable rupture-prone plaque while the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages are mostly present in vascular adventitia, far from the lipid core, and more stable regions of the plaque [123-125]. M1 macrophages show increased lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, destabilized lysosomes, activated oxidative stress, defective efferocytosis, and elevated release of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-1β, and TNF-α, as well as ROS. On the other hand, M2 cells enclose small lipid droplets and are supposed to stimulate atherosclerosis regression through several mechanisms including supplementation of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10 and TGF-β), clearance of dying cells through efferocytosis, and tissue repair following collagen formation and angiogenesis [126]. Collectively, these data suggest that the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages might play a crucial role in the transition from pro-inflammatory plaques with microcalcifications to resolution of inflammation associated with plaque macrocalcification. Interestingly, a similar role for M1 and M2 macrophages is also strongly suspected during bone fracture healing (reviewed in [127]).\n\nWe consider important in future experiments to thoroughly characterize how inflammation, calcification, and/or ossification are interconnected in atherosclerotic plaques. The emerging treatments targeting IL-1β will likely impact this association, with beneficial and/or detrimental consequences. Anti-IL-1β therapies are efficient in reducing inflammation and calcification in mice [128] as well as recurrent cardiovascular events in patients [129]. However, a recent study indicated that IL-1β inhibition induces negative effects on advanced atherosclerotic plaques and that IL-1β exerts its protective effects acting both on VSMCs and macrophages [130]. Whether calcification is impacted differently when IL-1β is inhibited in early versus advanced plaques is not known but deserves particular attention.\n\nIn conclusion, a huge amount of data highlight the strong interrelationship between inflammation and calcification in atherosclerotic plaques, with inflammation playing an important role in calcium deposition and calcifications exacerbating inflammation. However, efforts still remain to be done to better understand whether and how inflammation, or its resolution, impacts plaque macrocalcification leading to plaque stabilization."
