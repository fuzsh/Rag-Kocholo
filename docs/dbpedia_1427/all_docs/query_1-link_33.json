        "text": "\"A disk containing sounds. Play on a phonograph. 78 RPM.\"\n\n—Details Window\n\nRecords are in-game items that can be placed in a phonograph to play music from any area of the game. Phonographs are found in Jack's Place (pre-split and post-split, Human Path) or Fort Helencia (post-split, Nonhuman Path). Records can also be used to gain the friendship of Ernest and Martinez, who are both looking for the music of their opposite species, and Donkey, who wants you to buy every record he sells.\n\nYou can buy records from Chic Records in Radiata, Donkey in the Dorse region, and Pitt in City of Flowers. Some records can be won during battles, while others can be found by kicking things.\n\nAll the records that are sold can be bought for 1000 dagols, except for Earth Valley, which is only 200 dagols.\n\nOther than Earth Valley, Ganz's Theme, Jack's Theme, and Ridley's Theme, all records can be sold back for 500 dagols; the above four can only be sold back for 100 dagols.\n\nAll of the records can be found on the Original Soundtrack, though they're called by different names."
