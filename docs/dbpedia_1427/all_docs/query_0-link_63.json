        "text": "HHV Records: Vinyl Online Shop\n\nVinyl was, is and shall remain the medium embodying the love of music like no other. HHV has developed to a home for passionate record collectors offering a large selection of vinyl LPs and singles since 2002. From current releases and coveted limited editions to reissues of timeless classics – in our online record store we carry vinyl records of all formats in a range of more than 80,000 titles, complemented by a hand-picked selection of CDs and tapes.\n\nFrom rap to rock – vinyl records from all important genres\n\nFor us, vinyl records are more than retro – it is the sheer analogue listening pleasure and the various facets of vinyl culture that have been fuelling our enthusiasm for many years. Our initial repertoire of hip hop, r’n’b, jazz, funk and soul has grown into a comprehensive selection of genres. Today, it includes electronic music such as house, techno, downbeat & leftfield, dubstep or electro to reggae, rock and indie through to soundtracks. We consider ourselves a classic record shop on the web, which stocks all important new releases, classics and rarities in the best quality.\n\nSpecial records: specials from top labels and own releases\n\nGaps in the vinyl collection want to be filled and the curiosity for unknown music constantly kindled and satisfied. To this end, we regularly present specials together with labels like Stones Throw Records, Ninja Tune, Daptone, Warp or XL Recordings. Our range is complemented by exclusive releases from our own labels labels Project: Mooncircle, 90's Tapes, Beat Jazz International and HHV Boombap 45s. While we particularly focus on rap and Instrumental hip hop with the former, we pursue our passion for electronic sounds with the latter.\n\nVinyl formats from 7 inch single to double LP\n\nDisc jockeys and vinyl collectors as well as aficionados of audiophile editions can find their preferred record format at HHV. DJs swear by 12 inch and 7 inch singles, while hi-fi enthusiasts love the outstanding sound quality of audiophile LP pressings. Collectors, in turn, appreciate the satisfying feeling of holding a 180 gram copy of their favourite album’s reissue in their hands. Regardless whether EP, LP, double LP, reissue or 10 inch vinyl – HHV has room on its shelves for all vinyl formats.\n\nBesides vinyl records: CDs and tapes"
