        "text": "BY ASHLYN COHEN\n\nSophomores Paige Martz and Sydney Mrejen both inspire one another to embrace their love for vinyl collections. Although vinyls made its peak during the early 1970’s, they are making a comeback. Their antique and aesthetic look is eye catching to the modern teenager.\n\nVinyls provide a rich quality sound that draws music lovers attention to purchase. The average price for a vinyl record player can be quite expensive ranging from $15 to $30 dollars an album. However, for both Martz and Mrejen the charge is worth the experience.\n\n“My collection started last year when I bought a bright pink Wallows record that was etched because I thought it looked really cool and wanted to hang it on my wall,” Martz said. “That led me to deciding that I wanted a record player, so I begged for one for Christmas. Since then I now own around 60 records.”\n\nMartz introduced the idea to one of her closest friends, Mrejen, to the world of vinyl and Mrejen soon fell in love. The two consistently go shopping for vinyls to fill up their collection.\n\n“Once I came over Paige’s house she showed me the pink Wallows record she bought and I was obsessed.” Mrejen said. “The whole 70’s vibe and insane quality doesn’t compare to listening to headphones with earbuds plugged in, the experience is surreal.”\n\nVinyl records provide listeners with a personal connection to music. A deeper listening experience is created by physically purchasing an album, holding the cover art and listening to the songs in their original order.\n\nThe price however can be the reason one immediately loses interest. However, Martz and Mrejen have found a way around this problem.\n\n“I try to only buy albums that I love entirely because it’s hard to skip songs and they aren’t cheap,” Martz said. “Sometimes me and Syd (Sydney Mrejen) will go find albums at GoodWill, from my dad’s old collection, or even online you can get lucky sometimes if people are selling them for cheap.”\n\nThough the prices are high, the experience of music contains a different level of excitement that these teens won’t encounter using a typical phone, recorder, or speaker. The echo effect from the vinyl can make one feel like at a concert.\n\n“The ambiance of a vinyl is honestly insane,” Mrejen said. “ It’s something you’ll never find anywhere else. It’s kind of crazy because when I’m in my own room listening to Harry Styles, it almost feels like I’m listening to him live.”\n\nWhile the vinyl records contain many amazing features, a big idea to inquire about is the fact that vinyls made such a big comeback.\n\nThe vinyl record made its biggest hit in 1973, becoming the most useful source of music listening before apps like Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora came out.\n\nAs the years go on, the new generation has certainly brought back trends that came from the 70’s, 80’s, 90’s and even the 2000’s.\n\n“You can tell that even in styles, dances and music, old trends are coming back in style,” Mrejen said. “It’s pretty cool that you can surround yourself with older antiques or trends including a vinyl that will suit your style and music taste.”\n\nThe antique idea as well as a generational heirloom is a very special part about owning vinyl. Ones’ music taste can be passed down for future generations to listen to and enjoy.\n\n“I have all my dad’s old records like Van Halen and my grandmother’s Elvis records,” Martz said. “I think it’s just really crazy to play them and realize they listened to them while they were younger and now I get to do it too, and hopefully pass it on to my future children.”\n\nDue to the special label the vinyl is given Martz and Mrejen purchased the specific records that contain a lot of meaning to them, or ones they really like.\n\nUsually the artist or album that contain the most significance or meaning to the teens were ones that were selected to be a part of their collection.\n\n“I own a lot of Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift, Wallows, Declan McKenna and Conan Gray, but there are many different genres I like too,” Martz said.\n\nVinyls withhold a lot of history and the new vinyl trends are bringing the old form of music back."
