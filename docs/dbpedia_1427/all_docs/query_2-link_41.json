As the record revolves at 33 1/3 rotations per minute, a tiny “needle,” or stylus, simultaneously moves along the groove and vibrates back and forth parallel to the surface…\n\nRead More\n\ncomparison with compact disc\n\nIn compact disc: Dynamic range\n\n…70 decibels on the best phonograph discs, thus accounting for the distinct, clear sound obtained from even the cheapest CD players. Nevertheless, some audiophiles maintain that the best phonograph recordings stamped on polyvinyl chloride (or “vinyl”) discs deliver subtle musical overtones that are almost invariably lost in the digitization process.\n\nRead More\n\ncontribution by Goldmark\n\nIn Peter Carl Goldmark\n\n…1/3 revolutions-per-minute (rpm) long-playing (LP) phonograph record, which revolutionized the recording industry. Goldmark joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) Laboratories in 1936. There he began work on a colour-television system that was first demonstrated in 1940. Based on the use of a rotating, three-colour disk, his field-sequential system was improved…\n\nRead More\n\ncylinder recording\n\nIn cylinder recording\n\nphonograph record, invented by Thomas A. Edison in 1877. The sound to be recorded was focused by a horn onto a diaphragm, causing it to vibrate; the vibrations were transmitted to a stylus and modulated its motion as it followed a helical path along the…\n\nRead More\n\nmotion-picture sound\n\nIn motion-picture technology: Introduction of sound\n\n…with recording on a phonograph disc and developed a 16-inch (40.6-centimetre) disc rotated at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute; they improved loudspeakers, introduced the moving-coil type of speaker, and generally improved the entire electronic amplification system. The Warner Bros. movie studio became interested in all these developments and formed…\n\nRead More\n\nnoise\n\nIn electronics: Digital electronics\n\n…is the sound from a phonograph record, which always contains some extraneous sound from the surface of the recording groove even when the record is new. The noise becomes more pronounced with wear. Contrast this with the sound from a digital compact disc recording. No sound is heard that was…\n\nRead More\n\nradio\n\nIn broadcasting: Techniques and borrowings\n\nRadio broadcasting exploited the phonograph record as a means of preserving sound; in a similar way, television drew upon the film. The invention of magnetic tape for recording both sound and video signals has now linked together all of the mechanized media—phonograph, telephone, radio, sound film, and television—and made…\n\nRead More\n\nturntable\n\nIn turntable\n\n…rotating platform that carries a phonograph record. Turntables commonly revolve at 16 2/3, 33 1/3, 45, or 78 revolutions per minute; many record players have gearing that allows the user to choose among these speeds. For best sound reproduction, constant turning speed is crucial; transcription turntables used by radio stations…\n\nRead More\n\nmusic\n\nrecording\n\nIn music recording: Composition\n\nThe use of the record as a medium had superficial beginnings as early as 1904 in Ruggero Leoncavallo’s song “Mattinata”, specifically written for the record according to the label. Later, in 1925, Stravinsky composed a piano piece, Serenade in A Major, expressly for the record medium, though it is…\n\nRead More\n\nreproduction\n\nIn phonograph\n\n…a groove on a rotating disc. A phonograph disc, or record, stores a replica of sound waves as a series of undulations in a sinuous groove inscribed on its rotating surface by the stylus. When the record is played back, another stylus responds to the undulations, and its motions are…\n\nRead More"
