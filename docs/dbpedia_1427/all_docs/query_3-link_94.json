        "text": "“In 2010, when I was working on the biography of Gauhar Jaan, one of India’s first record artists, I wanted to listen to her voice and analyse it. But it was just impossible to find records from 1902 in good condition. And even if we did find the records, finding the right equipment to play them was the problem,” he says.\n\n“Over the last 10 years, we have collected almost 15,000 gramophone records. While we got several donations from people who no longer wanted to keep their records, we also sourced a huge chunk from chor bazaars and junk and scrap collectors across the country,” he says. So far, AIM has digitised 7,000 records. “The process requires quite a bit of time and effort. Currently, it’s just me and a technician working on digitisation. Also, the pandemic has slowed down the process,” he adds. AIM has also begun archiving living music traditions on the verge of extinction.\n\n“Like many countries, India should have its own national archive of music. Most archivists who work independently do not make their collections available to the public. If the government took up the initiative, it would make the music available for all,” she says.\n\nMusician and collector Jonathan Freer recommends cleaning vinyl records with distilled water and isopropyl alcohol. “Once you clean them, you might have to let the records play twice or thrice before you can get clearer audio out of them. There are some facilities that offer vinyl cleaning and preserving services, but not in Bengaluru,” he says. Vinyls can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, but not shellac records. “Clean shellacs only with water and very mild detergents. These records are way more fragile than vinyl records. One wrong move and they break into pieces,” says Gajendra. The records must be kept in proper sleeves to avoid any damage. Jonathan believes the true essence of a recording is lost when it is converted from analog to digital. “As a collector, it is best to preserve and maintain the records in their original form. It takes time and effort, but it can be done,” he says."
