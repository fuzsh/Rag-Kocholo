        "text": "This is an archive of a previous newsletter. To get the Olivia Blacke newsletter delivered to your inbox so you’ll be the first to know about fun giveaways, important news, and upcoming events, use the newsletter signup form, which can also be found on the menu! Since this is an archive, some of the events, sweepstakes, or giveaways have ended.\n\nTo my new subscribers and long term supporters: Hello! Hope y’all are settling into the New Year with fabulous reader goals and are ready to have some fun!\n\nThe Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\n\nKirkus says that Rhythm and Clues is “A well-paced probe into a messy death highlights the rewards of joining ingenuity with persistence.” Read the entire review here!\n\nRambles\n\nI don’t know about you, but there are some words I always have trouble spelling. One of those is Rhythm. I mean, just look at it. There is no rhyme or reason to spell it like that! Over the past year, I’ve typed “Rhythm” more times than I can count so you’d think that I would have learned to spell it the first time by now. You’d be wrong. Which goes to show that you don’t have to be a great speller to be a writer!\n\nSince the release date for Ryhthm Rhytum RHYTHM AND CLUES is coming out in a few months (March 26th!), there will plenty of goodies, giveaways, and appearances to talk about in the upcoming weeks but I do have some SPECTACULAR NEWS to share: The Record Shop Mysteries are getting a Large Print Edition! As someone with low vision myself, this is super exciting. I collect print books to get signed and display on my shelves but I struggle to read them, preferring e-books and audiobooks instead. But now people with low vision like me will be able to read the large print versions! I’ll share the links when they’re available but for now I can tell you that the Large Print versions are coming out in May (VINYL RESTING PLACE), June (A FATAL GROOVE), and July (RHYTHM AND CLUES) this year from Thorndike Publishing.\n\nSpeaking of audiobooks, the audiobook links for RHYTHM AND CLUES (Audiobooks.com, Libro.fm, Audible, Kobo, and more!) will be available closer to publication.\n\nChance to Win a Free Copy of RHYTHM AND CLUES\n\nWant to win a FREE PRINT COPY of RHYTHM AND CLUES? (of course you do!)\n\nEnter the GoodReads Giveaway here: https://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/enter_choose_address/371011-rhythm-and-clues-the-record-shop-mysteries\n\nEntry period ends Jan 31, 2024, so don’t delay! US and Canada only.\n\nSince this is an archive, this offer may no longer be available. To avoid missing limited time offers like this in the future, please sign up for my newsletter.\n\nPreorders are Live!\n\nOnce again, my fantastic local indie is offering exclusive signed, personalized copies of RHYTHM AND CLUES! Preorder through One More Page Books (https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/rhythm-and-clues-signed-olivia-blacke) to get your copy! Also, check out their subscription boxes and if you’re in the Arlington, VA area, drop by to browse their wine, chocolate, and book selection.\n\n…Teaser Alert…\n\nAs you may know, in addition to my cozy mysteries, I have a non-cozy supernatural mystery series starting this fall! Maybe you’ve heard authors say that the first 95,000 words of a book are the easy part – choosing the title is the hardest! I assure you that this is no joke. This book has gone through more titles than cups of coffee I’ve had this week, but I think we’ve got a winner! (she says, knowing full well that as soon as she hits send on this newsletter, the name might change again.)\n\nA NEW LEASE ON DEATH is coming in hardback, e-book, and audiobook on October 29, 2024 from Minotaur, just in time for my favorite holiday – Halloween! I can’t wait to introduce y’all to Cordelia and Ruby, so keep your eyes peeled for more details about this spooky BOOk, coming later this year to bookstores near you."
