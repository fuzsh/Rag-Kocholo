        "text": "For 75 years, vinyl records have been an iconic format for beginner listeners and audiophiles alike. Despite the emergence of modern listening formats such as CDs and digital streaming services, vinyl records have managed to maintain their allure, accounting for 43% of all albums sold in the U.S. in 2022! Learn more about the evolution of vinyl records and turntables throughout the years!\n\nThe Birth of Vinyl\n\n“The phonograph will undoubtedly be liberally devoted to music,” Thomas Edison predicted soon after inventing the phonograph in 1877. The phonograph was a critical invention in the world of music as it not only recorded sound, but could also play the recording back. Edison’s phonograph was the beginning of “on-demand listening.”\n\nIn 1887, Emile Berliner created the gramophone, which became the baseline for future, modern-day record players. (Fun fact, the gramophone, with its unique horn shape, was the inspiration behind the name and design of the GRAMMY® Awards, first presented in 1959.) Records were originally made from celluloid and hard rubber, but shellac quickly became the favored material and remained the standard until being replaced by vinyl several decades later.\n\nIn 1931, RCA Victor produced the first records to play at 33-1/3 rpm. But it wasn’t until 1948, with the introduction of Columbia Records’ LP (long-playing) vinyl records, that the speed finally caught on. To compete, RCA Victor released the first 45 rpm single in 1949. Together, RCA Victor and Columbia Records continued to make great strides that would change the music industry forever, increasing their sales to up to 200 million by the 1950s.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Vinyl\n\nRecord players reached extreme popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, becoming a household staple for many. Audio-Technica was part of the continuous advancements in turntable technology, adding to the history with the AT35X, the original VM dual-magnet cartridge, which received patents worldwide in 1967.\n\nMoving into the 1980s, Audio-Technica debuted the iconic AT727, which was dubbed the “Sound Burger.” This was a portable turntable that quickly became a cult classic thanks to its style and functionality. In celebration of the brand’s 60th anniversary, the Sound Burger was re-released with modern updates, like Bluetooth® capabilities.\n\nBut just as technological advancements had created the turntable, later advancements nearly caused its demise. The introduction of CDs in the 1980s ultimately led to a decline in the popularity of turntables and vinyl records, given the convenience and sound quality of a CD.\n\nThe Resurgence of Vinyl\n\nEven through the rise of digital audio on cell phones and streaming services, vinyl record sales have increased for 17 years consecutively. Vinyl enthusiasts have likewise fueled the resurgence of turntables, including those made by Audio-Technica.\n\nIn 2009, Audio-Technica released the AT-LP120-USB, the first professional, direct-drive turntable for the brand. This turntable became one of the most popular Audio-Technica products across the United States and Europe, and would later be updated to the current AT-LP120XUSB model."
