        "text": "PHOENIXVILLE — Vinyl collectors and music lovers are in luck as Forever Changes, a new shop located at 28 South Main Street in Phoenixville opens just in time for holiday shopping on Small Business Saturday, Nov. 27.\n\nAdding to the borough’s flourishing arts and culture scene, the shop will offer more than records, including locally made artwork, and a space for live music performances.\n\nRecord selections will span a wide array of musical genres, from current popular music to jazz, rock, reggae and more. Both new and used vinyl, record players, vintage posters, tee shirts, and music related artwork will be among the shop’s colorful merchandise.\n\nOwners Shawn Cephas and Anna Spackman, both musicians, met while performing at an open mic night held at Steel City Coffee House and eventually got married. They decided Phoenixville was the perfect town to bring their vision of a diversely rich music store to life.\n\n“To me, it fits in with the whole vibe of Phoenixville,” said Spackman. “The shop will be its own niche, bringing together music and art. Music has always been a big part of our lives. That is thing about Phoenixville, there are just so many artists and people who are passionate about music and supporting local music.”\n\nCephas began his passion of bringing vinyl to the community two years ago with a vinyl pop-up booth at Heart Stone Coffee in Franklin Commons, before moving his booth to Steel City. He saw an enormous interest from local shoppers and quickly realized there was a strong market for vinyl. He decided to carry out his vision of opening a full record shop, something he had firsthand experience with stemming from his childhood. The name “Forever Changes” was taken from a favorite song from the psychedelic band Love.\n\nCephas’ love of music began early, growing up in Philadelphia. His father started the iconic King James Records stores in three locations around the city, two in West Philadelphia and one in the north section of town. Open from 1967 through 1997, the initial shop expanded into three stores, and was known as a culturally innovative and pioneering presence in the Black community. Cephas grew up in an apartment above the storefront. Renowned among record labels, musicians often visited the shop — from Bob Marley to Mariah Carey.\n\n“Back then, to get music you had to go to a record store. My understanding of my dad’s philosophy is that he wanted an option for the Black community. He was a community person. He loved being in the city and he loved being in the store,” Cephas remarked.\n\nNoting the importance of small businesses working together and supporting one another rather than being in competition, Cephas said he plans to carry on his father’s legacy — opening a gathering space for everyone in the community through his shop.\n\n“I want a place where anyone can come and feel welcome. This world will not grow if anyone feels like an outsider. I am going up against streaming and Amazon, with the hopes that people will come in and support small businesses and the artists here,” he said.\n\nPhoenixville based artist Dave Yasenchak is one of several local artists who will have merchandise in the new shop.\n\n“I couldn’t be happier that Forever Changes will have a permanent home in our town, and I’m tremendously grateful to a part of it. Shawn is not only upholding and honoring his father’s legacy, but creating his own in Phoenixville,” Yasenchak said."
