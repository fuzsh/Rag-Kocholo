        "text": "There is an impending blackface problem involving my record countdown. I’ve thought some about it long before the latest revelation involving Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey surfaced Thursday.\n\nShe has a blackface problem, for sure. Hers is much bigger than mine, which involves iconoclast Frank Zappa.\n\nSo, let me tell you about my problem.\n\nI started My Vinyl Countdown (MVC) just under three years ago after I was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, a fatal degenerative brain disease that slowly erodes brain function.\n\nWith my website and an annual charity basketball tournament called MikeMadness, I am raising awareness and money to battle this disease, which is hard to diagnose and not well known. That’s despite it being the second leading form of dementia after Alzheimer’s.\n\nOn my website, I am counting down my 678 vinyl record albums by reviewing them and reminiscing. And I’m doing this alphabetically – A to Z. I’m more than halfway there with about 350 finished and posted. Between posts about my albums I write about Lewy body disease and many other issues light and dark for AL.com.\n\nAt the end of the countdown are the ‘Z’s. Even though he may not be the absolute last ‘Z’ in my collection, Frank Zappa represents an ending point. I often tell people I am counting down from the Allmans to Zappa. My vow is to review all of my records before I succumb to my disease. My estimation of completion based on my current review rate is more than two years from now.\n\nWarren Zevon will likely be my actual last one alphabetically speaking (I think I wore my ZZ Top album, “Tres Hombres’ out. But it’s Zappa I want to talk about here. On the cover of two albums, Joe’s Garage Act 1 and the double record Joe’s Garage Acts 2 and 3, Zappa is in blackface.\n\nI’ve searched the Internet to see if this has ever been a point of controversy. One commenter argued it was grease from “Joe’s Garage’ and never meant to be blackface. Another called bullshit on that –Zappa is a cruel ironist in addition to being a great musician. He famously made fun of the hippie drug taking crowd with the double 1960s album “Freak Out” and even took on the Beatles with “We’re only in it for the Money.” I haven’t had the time in my life to read all of Zappa’s script on Joe’s Garage 2 and 3 as presented in a multi-page inner album booklet. I don’t really care enough to. A good question is what’s with the black paint. Another chat room pontificator thought it was mud and not blackface and that’s why he’s holding a mop.\n\nThis is not a Zappa problem; he’s been long dead anyway. But the reason I call this a MyVinylCountdown problem is because the blackface images have become nearly as toxic as the N-word. Should I perpetuate that image? Should I skip Zappa altogether? Or just treat him like every other artist in the long list of musical artists on my blog?\n\nWhatever the reason, he chose to use the blackface cover, and he can get a halfway hall pass by calling it art – remember the Robert Mapplethorpe ‘Piss Christ’ controversy a few decades back. In fact, Zappa testified in Congress against parental warning labels promoted by Tipper Gore. It was almost like the Congress folk lined up to be verbally disarmed and then abused by Zappa, possibly the smartest guy in the room. They were as Zappa was wont to do arguing about freedom of expression. What are the boundaries? When you push those boundaries you get reactions. How extreme is too extreme? Methinks Zappa would stand wholeheartedly with Kay Ivey right to wear blackface, which she says she can’t remember if she did or not during a skit while in college. But she didn’t deny it.\n\nZappa and Ivey, can you think of a more unlikely pair? If Ivey listened to some Zappa her head might explode. If she had been in the PRMC debate, she would be not on Zappa’s side.\n\nWith Zappa, people can speak out and condemn his blackface which has been seen by exponentially more people than Ivey’s blackface. People can choose not to buy his records and that’s pretty much it. With the governor of Alabama the consequences are obviously different. She was elected by the people (enough to win) of Alabama.\n\nBut to come full circle, some might say I shouldn’t even write about Zappa at all? I definitely think I should write about him and his music. Even if his alter-ego can be one who spews vulgarity sharper than the worse potty mouth in your Grade 6 class. When he went on to write some classical pieces, he showed a love for discordance rather than smooth melody.\n\nThe tile song ‘Joe’s Garage was the one that got me interested coming out in 1979 as I transferred from the University of Georgia to Auburn University. The song is one of a handful by Zappa that are/were clean enough to play on the radio. And it is very well done.\n\nHe’s interesting. Wikipedia describes the album this way:\n\nThe album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. .\n\nRolling Stone magazine’s Don Shewey wrote: \"If the surface of this opera is cluttered with cheap gags and musical mishmash, its soul is located in profound existential sorrow. The guitar solos that Zappa plays in Joe’s imagination burn with a desolate, devastating beauty. Flaws and all, Joe’s Garage is Frank Zappa’s Apocalypse Now.\n\nSo at the risk of going on longer than the guitar solo in the instrumental, Watermelon in Hay, I’ll say Zappa’s blackface was aimed at censorship and government control. The narrator of the album was called the Central Scrutinizer.\n\nThe title song itself, however, reveals little of this theme:"
