        "text": "“Conspiracy, Them, Abigail, Fatal Portrait”\n\nKing Diamond\n\nMetal Blade Records\n\nSpecial Edition Vinyl Picture Discs\n\nOur Score: 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\nWith the reintroduction of Vinyl back in to the mainstream many labels have starting re-releasing their back catalogs on titles which either were never available on vinyl or have been long since out of print. Metal Blade Records has been a big proprietor of this practice and their most recent re-releases come from the one and only King Diamond. Media Mikes had the chance to check out four of these releases (“Them, Fatal Portrait, Conspiracy, Abigail”) and needless to say we quite please with the listening experience.\n\nRight out the box before even starting up my turn table I could tell that these four records were going to be something special. All of the albums are pressed on 180 gram vinyl and adorned with beautiful album artwork and photos on both the A and B sides. Probably my favorite of the lot was the photo of a growling King which graces side A of the “Conspiracy” LP. Another thing I notice about the artwork was that all the colors were very vibrant making the art work pop quite nice. Probably the best example of this is that of the seductive woman cloaked in fire on the “Fatal Portrait” album. Not only were these four albums great to look at the sound quality was top notch and consistent across each of the reviewed editions. Classis songs like “Welcome Home”, “Abigail”, “Halloween” and “Victimized” will tear through your speakers as the Kings signature falsetto screams shriek to new levels while the shred-tastic instrumentation blows your mind on an entirely different level.\n\nMetal Blade spared no expense in the re-release of these four albums. The high quality vinyl makes for a tremendous sonic experience while the bold double sided art work provides a nice visual aspect as well. Both fans of the band and vinyl collectors will want surely want to check these out as they are some of the nicer re-releases I have encountered. Another cool thing is that some of these releases will be limited to only 2,000 prints making the collector factor quite high. If you’re into adding some true classic metal to your record collection or want to get these to display merely for the amazing art act fast as these surely won’t be around long.\n\n“Conspiracy” Track Listing:\n\nSide A\n\n1.)
