        "text": "After a trio of demo recordings and a split project with Kill Witch, Malicious Intent, Anti-Criss and Praefator, Mexican thrashers Phantom finally released a full-length album in 2023. Put simply, this is the sort of lethal assault that used to turn up on mid-80s speed metal compilations whereby said artist would rip your ears off then disappear, never to return.\n\nGuadalajara-based Phantom has that vicious vintage flavour; scathing, zipping bursts of spiteful energy that frantically weave their wiry way through your veins with acidic aplomb. It’s essentially no frills nastiness but with a vigour and vim channelled through frothing riffs and ravenous percussion.\n\nThe whole torrential downpour is headed by the usual vocal lashing from J.C. Necrohex, but on the whole it’s such an enjoyable. The tracks are driven by raw streaks of hellish hostility. In a time machine is this gem in the racks alongside Hallows Eve, Sentinel Beast et al; a lo-fi yet ripping entity sure to raise the dead. Released on CD with the highest standards available by DOOMENTIA.\n\n4 panel digipack\n\nGlossy lamination\n\nFolded lyrics sheet\n\nEach limited to 500 copies\n\nRelease and shipping date: 30th August 2024\n\nHalfway in between SORCERY’s Bloodchilling Tales, the famous Diablo videogame and a spinoff of Masters Of The Universe, Transylvanian Nightmare striking handmade artwork lets you know right away what the name of the game is doesn’t it? Those Mexican warriors may have started right after Covid and they surely didn’t stop since, this four-tracks EP being the follow-up to their debut album, Handed Execution and no less than three demos… Far being productive for the sake of it, it was actually a matter of forging (in fire) their own brand of classic speed and thrash metal and strike the iron while it was still hot. Hence Transylvanian Nightmare boiling like an unbridled volcano, ready to explode in your face…\n\nWhile the guitar solos and classic heavy metal arrangements abound here, PHANTOM undeniable biggest strength is their out-for-vengeance energy and neck-breaking pace. If the instrumental “Epitaph” features delicate acoustic arrangements and heart-breaking soaring melodies, the title-track is one ripping early-SLAYER like savage ride whereas closer “Raging Pyres” even adds hints of proto-death à la ONSLAUGHT to make sure no-one is left alive once those 19 minutes are over.\n\nReleased on CD with the highest standards available by DOOMENTIA, Transylvanian Nightmare is far just into a nostalgia trip but one fantastic METAL (yes, in capital letters) assault, so true to the vivid sound of 1986/87 speed/thrash metal than one could think the last thirty-five years had never existed!\n\n4 panel digipack\n\nGlossy lamination\n\nFolded lyrics sheet\n\nEach limited to 500 copies\n\nRelease and shipping date: 30th August 2024\n\nBefore you ask, LUDGAR is originally an abbreviated word for Loup de guerre (‘war wolf’), describing what was one of the largest trebuchet, or catapult if you will, used in medieval times. We’re basically talking here about one giant destructive force used to crush opponents and villages alike and it’s quite a fitting analogy for what LUDGAR the band stands for.\n\nFormed in 2024 in a dungeon in Linz, Austria by DEATH RACER and CHAINBREÄKER guitar player (here on bass) S. Bruckner and VENATOR drummer J. Steidl along L. Höller on vocals and S. Bolda on guitar, this new outfit is deeply entrenched in the 80s yet refuses to label their music as “everyone brought on the table their own influences.” One thing was made clear though: the result had to be rough and brutal. And their first demo Molochian Rites is, indeed, rough-as-fuck.\n\nAs soon as you’re confronted to such raw deliveries of songs like ‘Under Full Moon’s Light’ or ‘Black Torture’ – preceded by one creepy introduction performed on a church organ! – you know you’re treading on pure METAL, yes in capital letters – territory. Unfiltered, raw, explosive. Parallels will probably be made with early DESASTER, WITCHING HOUR or a blacker version of HELISH CROSSFIRE but the truth is LUDGAR does roar from a deeper and more malevolent pit, or should we say dungeon, where all light is shun.\n\nBONE colour limited to 100 units\n\nThree panel J-CARD\n\nBlack/clear case\n\nSo you think you’re metal aren’t you? Maybe so. But Katon W. De Pena is METAL incarnated. The man may have turned sixty last September but he’s more than ever ready to break necks and crush bones with the mighty HIRAX.\n\nAhead of their long-awaited new studio full-length album (their first in a decade!), upcoming European summer tour and armed with a young, exuberant and hungry line-up, Pena has teamed up with DOOMENTIA to offer a glimpse of their upcoming thrash inferno with this new four-tracks EP, featuring versions of four songs from said upcoming album exclusively mixed for this release-only by Bill Metoyer, the legendary ARMORED SAINT/SLAYER/D.R.I. producer who’s been collaborating with HIRAX ever since their debut full-length Raging Violence back in 1985.\n\nAnd whoever would be tempted to think that with age comes peace with mind should get ready to be annihilated by this EP opening salvo alone, ‘Drill Into The Brain’, aka sixty-three seconds of the most intense-as-fuck crossover/thrash you’ll hear this year!\n\nTwo colored versions each strictly limited to 250 copies\n\nFirst 4 tracks from upcoming full-length album\n\nExclusively mixed by legendary producer Bill Metoyer\n\nHoused in a noble gatefold w/glossy lamination\n\nArtwork by Thomas Pinheiro\n\nIncludes HIRAX / EXUMER tour 2024 poster\n\nHalfway in between SORCERY’s Bloodchilling Tales, the famous Diablo videogame and a spinoff of Masters Of The Universe, Transylvanian Nightmare striking handmade artwork lets you know right away what the name of the game is doesn’t it?

Hell, early material like their self-titled debut (and first cooperation with DOOMENTIA) back in 2011 was all about celebrating Tom G. Warrior genius one could say. But eager not to become just another addition to an already long list of ‘official clones’ the Italians soon spread their wings and soared musically. Yet they never truly forgot with the initial spark came from and now, entering their fifteenth year as an active band, it does make sense in a way to see them – even if for a brief moment – go full circle and back to where it all started.\n\nIn a way, this new EP is a tribute to both one of the most important metal band of the 80’s but also to their ourselves and their stubbornness, how back in the late 00’s having three misfits sporting spikes, bullet belts and striking warrior poses while screaming out a collective ‘ugh!’ was maybe the least cool thing one could have done. But instead of going down the easy road – come on, who needs a 78th cover version of ‘Into The Crypt Of Rays’? – they choose to pay homage to a least frequently visited alley of the FROST canon, their 1990 return-to-form album Vanity/Nemesis by picking up ‘A Kiss Or A Whisper’ and going as far as more or less reproducing the album iconic fragmented cover for this EP.\n\nThat cover was originally included on the TIME TO KILL RECORDS tribute CD album Mesmerized – A Tribute To Celtic Frost released last January along covers by other fellow Frostian acolytes such as DOOMRAISER, NECRODEATH or BÜNKER 66.\n\nOn the B-side, you’ll find a brand new version of ‘Rain Of Fire’ especially recorded for the occasion and whose original version is to be found on BARBARIAN self-titled debut, a very good representation of their core sound, where FROST, early speed metal and punk are all cracking the whip in unison.\n\nBLACK VINYL ltd to 300 copies\n\nChile has become synonymous so much with high-quality and arcane sounding death and black metal that on the other hand, it tends to overshadow the rest of the metal scene, still one of the most vibrant and interesting of the southern hemisphere. BITTERDUSK are a perfect case of a band lost in the flow so to speak, even if they’ve been around in a way or another for over twenty five years.\n\nTruth be told, they haven’t seemingly been that active during that quarter of a century. Or so it seems as they have nevertheless managed in between 2002 and 2017 to put out, either self-released either through small local labels, three high-quality albums which sadly flew totally under the radar for whoever lived outside of their country. Others would have given up or feel happy just playing the same local clubs to the same local crowd. But not BITTERDUSK.\n\nThe boys rolled up their sleeves, took matter in their own hands, started opening for big international acts in Chile but also gigging abroad, including Europe, while working on what is probably their magnum opus, Guardián del Valle.\n\nEntirely sung in Spanish, rooted both in antique doom such as CANDLEMASS and BLACK SABBATH but also classic rock, this beautifully produced set has a class on its own, alternating instant hooks (see the super-catchy guitar lick of ‘Ojos de la Montaña’ for proof) with heavy-as-fuck parts, with everything adorned with that delicate and typically south-American sensibility, taking the listeners… Somewhere else. Somewhere in one of those luxuriant and grandiose valley Chile is now known for, where Nature roars free out in the open. Just like BITTERDUSK.\n\nFor the first time ever, one of their albums is being released in Europe and given the usual high-quality DOOMENTIA treatment so here’s the chance to climb that mountain and see the sun a little bit closer.\n\nLimited to 300 copies worldwide\n\nJacket printed on 350gsm\n\nLyrics sheet\n\nIt’s not that often that you get the chance to work with a true legend, even more so for a special release. Hence DOOMENTIA pride to announce the upcoming release of a very special EP for the legendary death metal act MASSACRE in two different formats with exclusive content and tracklisting.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock for the last thirty years or so, MASSACRE should need no introduction. Not only have the Orlando-based band helped build the very foundations death metal was built upon in the late 80’s, not only have they put out one of the genre best debut ever with From Beyond but ever since Kam Lee has rightfully regained control and firmly put his hands on the steering wheel with 2021 massive Resurgence album, they’ve decided to play the game according to their rules.\n\nBesides working with a rotating line-up of musicians (incl. Jonny Pettersson from WOMBBATH and Rogga from PAGANIZER among others) according to the situation, either be it in the studio or live, they’ve chosen to carefully put out on a regular basis high-quality and limited EPs instead of the regular album/touring cycle. Tri-pocalypse is once ready to set the bar even higher.\n\nA well-known huge horror movie fan, Lee has decided to pay tribute to the three apocalyptic films by director John Carpenter, namely ‘The Thing’, ‘Prince Of Darkness’ and ‘In The Mouth Of Madness’ which all served as a direct aesthetic and lyrical source of inspiration, especially since all three were themselves hugely influenced by Howard Philips Lovecraft writings, one of MASSACRE favourite lyrical theme. The outro (‘Escape From The End Of The World’) was specifically created for this EP by composer Rob Reider, in the style of Carpenter original soundtracks.\n\nSays Lee: “I’m excited for fans to get a hold of this new EP in physical format, because that’s the true way it’s meant for it to be represented. Both versions are awesome and I encourage everyone to try and get both the vinyl and CD copies. It’s a must for the collectors and completionist. The music style still resonates an old school death metal sound veering only slightly from its early roots and continues to combine a mixture of the classic Florida death metal style with a contemporary Swedish death metal sound.”\n\nCompared to the vinyl, the CD version has two exclusive remixed and rerecorded versions of ‘They Never Die’ and ‘Beyond The Dunwich Hills’, two songs originally included on a supra-limited self-produced CD last year. If the first one is an homage to the vampriric mythology, the second one is directly inspired by the tabletop RPG series Arkham Horror and is a kind of sequel to the song ‘The Dunwich Horror’ from 2022 EP Mythos.\n\nTwo bonus tracks\n\nMiniposter sheet with lyrics\n\nLimited to 500 copies\n\nFour-panel digipack\n\nGERM BOMB and DOOMENTIA go way back, starting with the vinyl version of their second album, Sound Of Horns back in 2013, with Under A Fading Sun following two years ago. While Gist Sucked Out was put out udring the label hiatus, both parties are more than happy to renew their partnership with its successor, Monochrome Nightmare.\n\nStill led by the founding pair of Hempus Kuylenstierna (guitar, vocals, bass and organ) and Pierre Ohlsson (drums, vocals) Recorded in their hometown of Gothenburg at the Kust studio in between September 2022 and January 2023, album number five is one strange beast, both faithful to their D-beat/crossover roots with songs like ‘Narcissist’ while at the same treading on new, more rock n’roll ground but with an almost degenerate twist, such as on the opener ‘Nailed To The Cross’ or the post-punk pomp of ‘Sot’. Actually, the more you dive into the album, the more idiosyncratic it gets. Refusing to be pigeonholed yet with nevertheless his foot firmly on the pedal, the Swedish duo in their and self-proclaimed kings of ‘apocalyptic rock n’roll’ now in their fifteenth year of existence sounds more than ever like no-one else, even that means successfully inserting a French horn (!) into the mix like they did on ‘The Wolf’.\n\nDOOMENTIA has always been about supporting those who dare thinking out of the box. And no matter how punk they are, GERM BOMB most definitively fit the bill more than ever with Monochrome Nightmare!\n\nlimited to 300 copies\n\nblack vinyl\n\nsturdy cardboard 350gsm\n\nmatte resistant lamination\n\nreleased in cooperation with Insane Society records\n\nTo say that Belgium’s SCHIZOPHRENIA took the underground by storm would be an understatement. Ever since their first EP Voices four years ago and the following insanely intense debut album in 2022, those starving youngsters have reinjected a much need sense of urgency and danger in the otherwise now quite mundane territory separating thrash from death metal. By using elements of both and adding their own twist and fury to them, hey’ve become one of the hottest bands around. They may have spent most of 2023 with over 80 shows played all over Europe and be working, as we speak, on their second full-length yet they still did find time to record a very special EP, first released digitally and on self released CD but now available as a lavish, cut at 45 RPM speed to ensure the best sound quality possible LP thanks to DOOMENTIA.\n\nMeant to salute their wide range of influences, Chants Of The Abyss was destined to be a quite large selection of styles. And indeed, by opening the hostilities with a raging SLAYER tune (‘Necrophiliac’), the very first cover they worked on for this tribute, before switching to death metal (MORBID ANGEL’s immortal ‘Maze Of Torment’), classic heavy-metal (JUDAS PRIEST’s ‘Metal Meltdown’) and horror punk (MISFITS’ ‘Bullet’) before paddling back to old-school thrash (EXODUS ‘Strike Of The Beast’) and concluding on a hardcore note (GBH’s ‘Race Against Time’), it goes above and beyond its duty.\n\nWe’re not talking here of mere, carbon copy lazy covers but actual performances done with gusto, as if all those songs were theirs and freshly out of the rehearsal room. By paying homage to the godz, SCHIZOPHRENIA solidify their position as their legitimate heirs.\n\nTRANSPARENT RED ltd to 250 copies\n\nBLACK ltd to 250 copies\n\nLyrics sheet\n\nIt’s not that often that you get the chance to work with a true legend, even more so for a special release.

If the first one is an homage to the vampriric mythology, the second one is directly inspired by the tabletop RPG series Arkham Horror and is a kind of sequel to the song ‘The Dunwich Horror’ from 2022 EP Mythos.\n\n7\" EP GATEFOLD\n\nNEON GREEN ltd to 100 copies SOLD-OUT\n\nBLACK ltd to 400 copies\n\nSleeve printed on silver lamination\n\nIn the wake of their extremely well-received reunion in 2019 and the successful reissue of their cult debut album Far Away From The Sun six years earlier by Century Media, SACRAMENTUM have been since then carefully working on reissuing their whole back-catalogue so a whole new generation of fans could fully enjoy one of the Swedish melodic black/death scene best kept secret entire body of work. And thanks to DOOMENTIA, that task is now complete with the long-awaited first proper vinyl reissue of their very first recording…\n\nAfter various rereleases in cooperation with VIC RECORDS or COSMIC KEYS CREATIONS, SACRAMENTUM have closely worked with DOOMENTIA to offer the definitive version of Sedes Impiorum, maybe their most fascinating work. Back in 1992, after two years as TUMULUS where the then trio proved to be a pure product of their times with their classic Stockholm sounding form of death metal, founding members Nisse Karlén and Anders Brolycke vowed to distance themselves from this already too common sound to follow the left hand path.\n\nThe first songs resulting from this realignment can be found on this rough recording from December 1992, done in a small studio in Falkoping, Sweden. Although traces of their former style can be found here and there, the emphasis here is on creating the most evil sounding atmosphere possible. Of course we’re still quite far away from the intricate and complex arrangements filled style that will soon be theirs but it remains overall a fascinating early document of a band still finding their feet yet already determined NOT to follow the cattle.\n\nHaving painfully restored the original artwork for the occasion, DOOMENTIA is proud to make available again this piece of Swedish extreme metal history where everything started for SACRAMENTUM, still going strong over three decades later…\n\nBlack / yellow / green vinyl\n\nEach version limited to 333 copies\n\n8-panel booklet\n\nAs once again proven by their recent fourth album out on INVICTUS PRODUCTIONS, MALOKARPATAN is truly a band out of time with their unique mixture of heavy, black metal and medieval elements, deeply rooted in their native country cultural history. Nos less ‘weird’, in the sense they too refuse to be tagged or lumped into a specific category, NECROMANTE has also been following their own and as strange path for the last fifteen years or so, honouring not just their Brazilian elder brothers such as MYSTIFIER but the more occult-drive, atmospheric and primitive side of the early 90’s European scene as incarnated by MORTUARY DRAPE or SAMAEL ‘Into The Pentagram’-era.\n\nIn a way, both acts were bound to forge an alliance at some point. Thanks to DOOMENTIA, this dream has now become a reality with this very special split EP, featuring two exclusive tracks. If MALOKAPARTAN’s own ‘Daemon Zlatavych Noci’ is a slow-paced and gloomy piece dedicated to two cult acts from the late 80’s Czech proto-black metal scene TÖRR and MORIORR, NECROMANTE’s ‘Magickal Black Moon’ is the very first song recorded by the band now extended and international line-up, showcasing a rougher yet as bewitching style.\n\nTrue to high standards set up by the label since its very inception, DOOMENTIA has once again pulled all the stops and came up with two, different and highly collectable artworks, each dedicated to one of the two bands included, plus a lyrics sheet and a classy gatefold cover. Forces of darkness unite!\n\nLimited to 2 x 250 copies\n\nBlack 7\" vinyl\n\nGatefold cover\n\nTwo versions of packaging\n\nLyrics sheet\n\nHaving reestablished their fruitful collaboration since last spring, DISMA and DOOMENTIA are proud to offer to the fans a new addition to their series of long-overdue of reissues of the whole band back-catalogue. Among them all,The Graveless Remains holds a very special place: originally released back in 2017 in one-extremely limited edition of 600 copies on vinyl only, this was one DISMA first new recording in six years, first without ex members Daryl Kahan and Shawn Eldridge. Now introducing IMMOLATION/GOREPHOBIA stickman Craig Smilowski. In the meantime, the extreme metal scene had once again going through some drastic changes and one could have thought that due to their absence, DISMA wasn’t the towering force to be reckoned with when they delivered Towards The Megalith in 2011. How wrong were they…\n\nClocking at 14 minutes and featuring two exclusive songs, The Graveless Remains is DISMA at their meanest, most victim and overall brutal best. On side A, the title-track is probably one of their fastest and most to-the-point track ever whereas on the flipside, the nearly 8 minutes long ‘Sempiternal Deformity’ almost painfully drags the listener into the mud while beating him to death with the kind of slow and downtuned dirge only DISMA could come up, propelled by former INCANTATION frontman Craig Pillard's uncanny guttural grunt.\n\nDetermined not to let this brilliant EP vanished in obscurity and EBAY scammers take advantage of the band’s faithful fans, DOOMENTIA has decided to rerelease it as seven inch, with a gatefold cover, a brand-new and as bleak artwork by Dan “Sawblade” Shaw and a poster.\n\n100 copies colored (sold-out)\n\n400 copies black\n\nArtwork by Sawblade\n\nGatefold cover\n\nA3+ poster printed on 140gsm offset stock\n\nHELLISH CROSSFIRE has always been more than ‘just’ a band. Think of them as a gathering of like-minded maniacs, driven by their endless passion for 80’s metal and bands like KREATOR, BATHORY, VENOM and so on. Those Germans may have not been very prolific over the years but every single release of theirs, especially their two, pedal-to-the-max albums from 2006 and 2010, all had that special spark, the blazing fire burning inside only true dedicated warriors could provide. A true band of brothers, united ‘til the very end, even when one of them alas falls by the wayside…\n\nIn 2022, HELLISH CROSSFIRE four-stringer and founding member Sigi (aka ‘Sick’) passed away, leaving the black/thrash scene stunned and in disarray. After few months away from the public eye licking their collective wounds, not only has the band vowed to carry on but they’ve also decided to celebrate their fallen brother memory with a very special event. On December 1st and 2nd 2023, a festival, dubbed ‘Nights Of The Possessed’ and featuring bands like OLD, WITCHING HOUR, FATAL EMBRACE or DESASTER will be held in Hirschaid, Bavaria to pay homage to Sick.\n\nIn order to make this day even more special, in cooperation with DOOMENTIA, HELLISH CROSSFIRE have agreed to reissue for the very first time on vinyl their first official rehearsal tape from 2004, Unholy Tyranny plus the hardly distributed Demo II recorded the following year under the same conditions. Featuring a mix of later rerecorded songs for their debut Slaves Of The Burning Pentagram plus unreleased tracks, incl. a raging cover of the KAT classic ‘Metal And Hell’. Needless to say those versions are raw-as-fuck and not for the faint of heart but for the true metal fans!\n\n500 copies on picture LP, with two different versions each with a different picture of Sick on the B-side. Also included is an updated version of the Unholy Tyranny cover artwork originally created by Rok from SADISTIK EXEKUTION. Hail 80’s metal, hail HELLISH CROSSFIRE and Rest In Power Sick!\n\nPicture 12\" LP\n\n\"Pleasure to kill\" version limited to 250 copies\n\n\"Persecution mania\" version limited to 250 copies\n\nCircular die-cut jacket\n\nA4 insert sheet\n\nExclusive artwork by Rok\n\nRelease and shipping date 4th December\n\n\"Mörk himmel means dark sky.

Experienced musicians, played in bands, now we can say legends of the Czech underground (MOTHER, THEMA ELEVEN, !ÚL, SEE YOU IN HELL or TUMMO / hardcore, sludge, thrash, death or black metal), found themselves in a combination of these genres and their metallic crust quickly established not only on the Czech scene, but also abroad. In 2014, the band came out with a well-reviewed album \"Ostří černé kosy zní\", played at big festivals and small clubs, toured Europe, spread their dark and dirty music everywhere, and was one of the first bands in the Czech Republic to unite the previously almost antagonistic scenes - metal and hardcore. Some at MÖRKHIMMEL appreciated the raven's vocals and the metallic sound, others the hardcore disjointedness and crust dirt, and the mix of all of the above came from a split with another Czech band, THE TOWER, released in 2017.\n\nAfter a few years of a slight downturn, MÖRKHIMMEL is back this year with new variations on previously presented musical themes, now spiced up with additional influences and unexpected practices. Texts remain in the Czech language and are in the times \"from the cradle to the black coffin\", as one of the verse, but there are no happy stories in them, it is rather an \"implosion of vanity\".

The album is titled “Spiritual Exodus“ and in many ways continues where its predecessor “Digitotality“ from 2020 ends. Through the themes as reincarnation (Reflections, Ring-Pass-Not or Through a Glass Darkly, which is musicalized poem of general George S. Patton), altered states of consciousness (Initiation) or alternative points of view on our reality (Down The Rabbit Hole, Those Who Oppose), finding itself in the atmosphere of combining the ancient and current. The aesthetics of this aproach is even audible. Old school fashioned thrash metal is combined with modern and distinctive touch. The whole record concludes in seven plus minutes long instrumental called “Tiwanaku“ which links the music with fantastic artwork made by Paolo Girardi. “Spiritual Exodus“ will be out through DOOMENTIA RECORDS on LP (black, color gatefold), CD and MC.\n\n“Spiritual Exodus“ will be out through DOOMENTIA RECORDS on vinyl (black, color gatefold), CD and MC. Release date of the physical formats is September 22. Album will be out on all digital platforms on September 25, except bandcamp (6th of October – bandcamp Friday).\n\nCD jewel case\n\n12-page booklet\n\nArtwork by Paolo Girardi\n\nJapanese Heavy Metal warriors of METALUCIFER need no introduction to European die hard Metal fans, but they do not tour in Europe that often. This Autumn the band will play series of shows in Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France, Austria, Poland and Czech Republic, and to celebrate it, Doomentia Records will release special limited edition 12\" cut-out maxi single entitled \"Heavy Metal Bang Your Heads\", that includes title track in both English and Japanese versions. The release will be limited to 500 copies only.\n\nMETALUCIFER started in 1995 as a side project of Gezol, vocalist and bassist of the legendary Japanese Black Metal act SABBAT, but quickly turned into regular band with its own identity. Except releasing several mini albums, singles and live albums, METALUCIFER released 3 studio albums: “Heavy Metal Drill”, “Heavy Metal Chainsaw” and “Heavy Metal Bulldozer”. Their newest release entitled “Heavy Metal Ninja”, a special double mini LP – with 4 brand new songs recorded in 2 versions: with English vocals, and with Japanese vocals, came out in 2022. Love them or hate them – their unique style is like a statement. They don’t like or play heavy metal. They ARE heavy metal. Fans of early IRON MAIDEN, ANGEL WITCH, VENOM, HEAVY LOAD and other obscure New Wave Of British Heavy Metal acts: red alert!\n\n12\" cut-out vinyl maxi single\n\nWhite vinyl\n\nHoused in a sturdy discobag\n\nTour poster 600x600mm\n\nOne-time pressing only\n\nLimited to 500 copies\n\nFour months after the super-limited and already sold-out Cataract EP, ALTARAGE strike back with their sixth full-length, and first for DOOMENTIA since 2016’s Nihl.\n\nThose hooded musicians’ taste for thick and noisy layering is quite notorious and indeed, the guitars alone here are not just drowned in tar but are actually bathing in it in delight. Yet somehow for this quite concise album things are taking a slightly different turn here, the mysterious trio has somehow decided to stray away a bit from their usual path in order to achieve something even more unsettling and bizarre, yet as crushing.\n\nIf Worst Case Scenario eight tracks – including the song ‘Cataract’ already included on the EP of the same name yet here with a different mix – are once again some of the heaviest and noisiest bastard sons of the (un)holy trinity of black, death-metal and harsh noise you’ll ever hear this year, a new sense of clarity can felt through some of them. Far from away from the standard ‘metal’ production values and more akin to, say, a strung-out noise-rock band desperately looking for their next fix, instead of lessening their impact, this sonic revaluation maximizes it even more.\n\nYet at the same time, with songs for example like ‘The Rigid Subject’ or ’Exhaust’, ALTARAGE never sounded so chaotic and so on the verge of imploding, super-nova style. Proving once and for all that no other band sounds or even dares going as far as into the abyss as they do… Behold, Worst Case Scenario could well be your worst nightmare.\n\nFull-lenght album on CD\n\nJewel case\n\n12 pages booklet\n\nFour months after the super-limited and already sold-out Cataract EP, ALTARAGE strike back with their sixth full-length, and first for DOOMENTIA since 2016’s Nihl.\n\nThose hooded musicians’ taste for thick and noisy layering is quite notorious and indeed, the guitars alone here are not just drowned in tar but are actually bathing in it in delight.

You get energy and raw metal on black vinyls and live recordings of great and unforgettable shows at sold-out festival from leading names of European black/thrash scene!\n\nSaid about this release:\n\nBorys (Barbarian): \"We never had any plans of releasing a live album, but we felt so comfortable at Thrash Nightmare Fest and the level of energy was so high, that these recordings just couldn't stay shelved.\"\n\nAethon (Eurynomos): \"We really did enjoy the energy of the show, the maniacs in the first rows were true fistbanging wild warriors, just listen to „Spell of Necromancy“ where a stagediver cut the guitar.\"\n\nLunatic Aggressor (Nuctemeron): \"Live at Thrash Nightmare-official bootleg\" perfectly captures the absolute underground atmosphere of Thrash Nightmare.

A year after that, the seminal Worm Ritual album was released. Then after a year of sporadic festival dates and the like, and the emergence of the pandemic, the band moved it´s home base to Portland in search of a fresh lineup / sound.\n\nIn early 2021, still in the depths of Covid, a death pact was formed with none other than DD LAZY, the sick freak behind Headsplit Records, Hemorrhoid, and many other atrocities! From this sickening union a hellish EP was formed. Recorded on a shitty old four track at the practice space, it has a truly weird and extreme sound, one that the underground maniacs have been craving! Even if you thought that earlier recordings like Worm Ritual were, indeed, filthy-as-fuck, you´ll still never know what´s going to hit you with Nganga. These four new exclusive songs, and first recordings in over three years, are just nasty man. Nasty. Zack Ripper´s guitar tone here is made of the same weird slimy mixture the toxic avenger had fallen into, backed by a nuclear and throbbing bass and the most vitriolic vocals you´ve heard this year. Punk-as-fuck, thrashing to the extreme and always on the verge of collapsing, to put it simple, NEKROFILTH has never sounded this pissed off!\n\nOn top of all of that, once again you can count on DOOMENTIA RECORDS for some seriously cool packaging. Strictly limited to 500 copies, this one-sided deluxe 12\" EP includes a lyrics sheet, circular die-cut jacket, which exposes, wait for it, a deep lenticular effect on the B-side to die for. You definitely don´t have anything in your collection like this! NEKROFILTH and DOOMENTIA RECORDS are fucking back!\n\nSpecial edition of 500 copies\n\nOne-sided 12\" MLP\n\nLenticular picture with a deep effect on the B-side\n\nJacket with circular die-cut, printed on both sides\n\nMangy lyrics sheet\n\nShipping: August 7th\n\nGranted, there’s been a bunch of so-called death metal “super-groups” since the dawn of the millennium. A gathering of talented, determined to show the kids how it’s done and what death freakin’ metal truly means. But very few, if none, had the impact DISMA had. Simply put, their debut demo The Vault Of Membros basically erased all competition back in 2009. Not only did this first recording mark the first collaboration in between INCANTATION “cult” front man Craig Pillard and early guitarist Bill Venner. Now joining with members of FUNEBRARUM. But its earth-shattering heaviness and supreme brutality set a new benchmark for downtuned dark doom/death metal.\n\nFan from day one, DOOMENTIA has been working with the band since 2011 and their first European tour. Besides two split EPs, DOOMENTIA set up new standards with the LP version of their sole album, Towards The Megalith whose diehard edition featured a six panel tri-fold fantastic sleeve with an extra inserted 7 inch.\n\nSince then, instead of putting out an endless stream of easily-forgettable releases, DISMA carefully choose to take their time and release the right songs at the right time. After some line-up adjustments, with now Craig Pillard handling both vocals and guitar duties. Their first new recording in five years, Earthendium showcases a continuous vision with even more effective and lethal firepower. Slightly doomier, yet still as crushing, these three new tracks (including the epic nine minutes long title-track) were recorded at the aptly titled, Neanderthal studios and proves than over eighteen years after their first rehearsal, DISMA remains one of the heaviest and rawest forces in death metal today.\n\nDOOMENTIA once again offered the band to take care of the LP version, determined to stay true to the standards set by Towards The Megalith twelve years prior and to release an easier-to-find version for European customers. Hence this extremely cool-looking one-sided lenticular 3D picture disc version. Ola Larsson’s spectacular dark-fantasy inspired art in all of its glory, displayed in a die-cut sleeve. A fitting monument to one of this years most impressive and dark-as-fuck EP's.\n\nSo be quick or be dead as this will be probably sold out in no time, as did all the previous DISMA releases on DOOMENTIA.\n\nSpecial edition of 500 copies\n\nOne-sided MLP\n\nLenticular picture with a deep effect on the B-side\n\nJacket with circular die-cut, printed on both sides\n\nThick insert"
