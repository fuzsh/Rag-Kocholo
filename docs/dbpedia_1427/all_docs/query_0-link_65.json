That customer was the town’s mayor. Tansy is under fire since she brewed the coffee. Family is everything to these three sisters, so they have each other’s backs when searching for the killer and trying to clear each and every one of them of suspicion.” “Cozy Case Files—New Titles for Your Spring & Summer Enjoyment” by Crime HQ, May 23, 2023 in Criminal Element\n\nBook Riot names A Fatal Groove as one of “15 Of The Best New Cozy Mysteries Coming Out In The Second Half Of 2023” by CJ Connor, June 2023\n\n“It’s a fast-pace storyline set in a small town in Texas. The author immediately drew me into the story and I felt like I was right there. These are characters I truly cared about and cheered for… I love all those settings, but this is unique. I enjoyed every minute of my time in Cedar River…To say I’m looking forward to book #3 would be an understatement.

But when the mayor drops dead after drinking their coffee, they must find the killer to clear their names. Says Lauren, “Full of twists and turns, this was a delightful caper!” (St. Martin’s, 2023)” – “7 Books We’re Loving Now” First for Women (4/8/2024 Print Magazine)\n\nA Fatal Groove is included in Aunt Agatha’s Best of Cozies 2023! “This clever mystery finds the sleuthing sisters looking into some local history with some frisson added to the story through Juni having to deal with old high school rivals.

Juni and her sisters thought opening a vinyl record shop/café called Sip & Spin Records was going to be their biggest hurdle, but the Frappuccino hits the fan when the mayor drops dead―poisoned by their coffee.

There are righteous clues and if some of them are slightly obvious, the reading experience was so pleasant I didn’t care. Juni is a great character and I can’t wait to follow more of her adventures.” — Robin Agnew for Aunt Agatha’s 7/21/2023\n\nJuni sits down for a question-and-answer session with dru’s book musings so that we can get to know her better. – Dru’s Book Musings 7/25/2023\n\nHow To Assemble The Perfect Cozy Mystery Meal, July 27, 2023 in CrimeReads\n\nCriminal Element featured an exclusive excerpt of A Fatal Groove, July 25, 2023\n\nCheck out my interview with Kym Roberts on the Fresh Fiction Cozy Corner!
