        "text": "PUNK\n\nQuick View\n\nMisfits\n\nMisfits Collection\n\nVinyl: $29.99 Buy\n\nVinyl LP repressing of this 1986 collection from the Punk legends. The compilation is officially titled Misfits, but is commonly referred to as Collection I and was made up as the first half of a pair with the later release of the compilation album Collection II. It includes several versions of songs that are exclusive to this compilation.\n\n$29.99\n\nQuick View\n\nKerry King\n\nFrom Hell I Rise [Indie Exclusive Black, Dark Red Marble LP]\n\nVinyl: $35.98 Buy\n\nHotly anticipated debut studio album from the legendary Slayer guitarist, Kerry King.\n\n$35.98\n\nQuick View\n\nSonic Universe\n\nIt Is What It Is [LP]\n\nVinyl: $27.98 Buy\n\nEmbark on an intergalactic musical odyssey with Sonic Universe's debut album, \"It Is What It Is.\" Corey Glover, acclaimed lead singer of Living Colour, and guitarist Mike Orlando from Adrenaline Mob join forces to explore new sonic dimensions. Recorded at Sonic Stomp Studios in New York City, the album kicks off with the dynamic title track, blending a powerful drumbeat, driving bass lead, and Corey's electrifying vocals.\n\nThe standout single, \"I Am,\" delivers a bold declaration of confidence and independence. The band, including TaykwuanJackson on drums and bassist Booker King, showcases a seamless fusion of their talents, culminating in a sound that's both fresh and unmistakably their own. As Living Colourgarners recent international attention, this collaboration with Adrenaline Mob brings forth a brave new world of musical exploration.\n\nLyrically, the album navigates personal and political themes, creating a rich tapestry that spans punk, funk, metal, and rock. \"It Is What It Is\" promises to elevate listeners to new heights with its diverse soundscape. Join Sonic Universe on this captivating journey through galaxies and time itself, where each track unfolds a unique chapter in this extraordinary musical universe.\n\n$27.98\n\nQuick View\n\nCoffins\n\nSinister Oath [Oxblood LP]\n\nVinyl: $23.98 Buy\n\nStitching together the frenzied snarl of gory early 1990s OSDM and eerily plodding doom intonations, COFFINS find no shame in continuing to perfect the vile, derelict strain of dungeon-crawling death-doom for which they are revered.\" - Invisible Oranges Japans COFFINS return with their crushing new full-length album, Sinister Oath. Recorded ahead of the band's 25th anniversary in Tokyo, Sinister Oath further cements COFFINS' legacy as one of the most putrid sounding and uncompromising Old School Death Metal bands in the world. From the chest-pounding, drudgy opening of \"Spontaneous Rot\" to the hammer-crushing riffage of \"Things Infestation\" thereafter, Sinister Oath creeps and crawls through a cavernous space firmly rooted in no-frills Death Metal. The band's signature sound is forever-present: equal parts bleak, doomy, crusty, disgusting, and wholly heavy. Featuring album art by Axel Hermann (Asphyx, Bloodbath, Demolition Hammer, Sodom, and more,) Sinister Oath is COFFINS at their most vile!\n\n$23.98\n\nQuick View\n\nIron Monkey\n\nSPLEEN AND GOAD [LP]\n\nVinyl: $26.99 Buy\n\n\"This is a thick, pummeling exercise in self loathing and meanness\"- Decibel Magazine\n\nThe UK's IRON MONKEY return with their highly anticipated new album, Spleen and Goad!\n\nOn the new album, the legendary band are as uncompromising ever, churning out some of the most gritty-sounding sludge doom in their 25 + year history. Dubbed a \"doom sludge vanguard\" by The Sludgelord, IRON MONKEY live up to their legacy, absolutely pummelling through each of the 9 tracks on their new album.\n\nFrom the two-ton, heavier-than-anything-else riff opening \"Concrete Shock\", IRON MONKEY show no signs of easing up; fuzzed out guitars crash against pulse-pound drums, set against vicious, misanthropic snarls and barks. Elsewhere, tracks like the aptly titled \"Rat Flag\" kicks the band into high gear with palpable fury and malaise.\n\nRecorded in their native Nottingham, Spleen and Goad was mastered stateside by Brad Boatright at Audiosiege.\n\n$26.99\n\nQuick View\n\nInter Arma\n\nNew Heaven [Electric Blue LP]\n\nVinyl: $23.98 Buy\n\nNew Heaven, INTER ARMAs latest album, is a compelling testament to perseverance, top to bottom. Its thicket of ever-dense layers of doom, death, and black metal occasionally let bits of light slip in, fleeting reminders to keep going amid the tumult.\n\nNew Heaven marks a sharp turn for the band, showcasing some of the most extreme and angular songwriting INTER ARMA has ever laid bare. Known for their cinematic take on sludgy, extremely cavernous, and borderline psychedelic Metal, the Richmond band broadens their dynamics by seesawing between piledriving momentum and swirling oblivion. New Heaven crushers and conquers, and illustrates what INTER ARMA can truly be.\n\nTake the title track, with its hair-raising lead riff stemming from drummer/songwriter TJ Childers challenge to himself to write a nonsensically dissonant part that he ended up loving. The song spirals upward into a punishing Death-Metal march, Meanwhile, vocalist Mike Paparos stentorian bellows the bludgeon, above an impossibly complicated web of riffs and rhythms. From the get go, New Heaven and the opening title track eschews any restraint - INTER ARMA is completely unchained.\n\nPaparos keen and empathetic lyrics about innocent victims of war, addiction, and social apathy affirm that feeling, as a survivor grimaces at the carnage behind him and presses ahead best he can. You stared into the brutish jaws of strifes heartless device, he growls into a chthonic blitz during The Children the Bombs Overlooked, a late-album powerhouse. And you turned your back to hell. That forward march out of madness is New Heaven in an armor-plated nutshell.\n\nThough this is indeed another INTER ARMA triumph, it is not a triumphant album, meant to offer some glib or naïve assurance that everything will be fine.\n\nWhat evidence is there for that, really, either on a record where friends are forced into submission, addiction, suicide, or retreat to a world where suffering remains the lingua franca? No, INTER ARMA and New Heaven are too realistic and experienced for that. This is, instead, a record about enduring brambles and curses and lasting long enough to make something profound, honest, and even affirming about it all every now and againexactly as INTER ARMA has on New Heaven.\n\n$23.98\n\nQuick View\n\nLike Moths To Flames\n\nThe Cycles of Trying to Cope [Light Blue LP]\n\nVinyl: $27.99 Buy\n\nKintsugi is the latest single from the Ohio based metalcore band Like Moths To Flames and will be used to launch their new album The Cycles Of Trying To Cope  out May 10th.\n\nThis release follows their 2020 album No Eternity In Gold which received praise from Wall Of Sound LMTF deliver their signature sound, but still manage to dial it up a few notches. I genuinely think that metalcore fans will be debating their number one metalcore album of the year and The Music Like Moths To Flames have positioned themselves back on the path of success and memorability, crafting a release that laughs in the faces of their many lacking core peers. There might be no eternity in gold, but there just might be an eternity in this kind of tightly-wound, well-rounded modern metalcore.\n\nWhen speaking about the meaning of track Kintsugi singer Chris Roetter states, When things go wrong, I think we are left to pick up the pieces and forced to choose which piece to leave with. If it's not possible to leave with everything the way it was before it broke, how do you know what piece to hold onto? .\n\n$27.99\n\nQuick View\n\nNight Sins\n\nA Silver Blade in the Shadow [Green and Black Marble LP]\n\nVinyl: $22.98 Buy\n\nNight Sins (Kyle Kimball of NOTHING) is aural proof this side of the Atlantic that life does not walk so dark all over Europe alone. Emerging sometime around 2010 under the oppressive skies of Philadelphia, these overcast malcontents are fitly connected to a city engrossed in shadow-soaked vices and dilapidated architecture. Not to imply that there isn't a comforting sort of gloominess in this musical malaise, as Night Sins frolic down the musical path originally cut by The Sisters of Mercy and Clan of Xymox with enough hints of The Mission and extensions into 80's darkwave to produce memorable songwriting that stands on it's own. Bass and drums punch through the mist thick as thieves, guitar lines circle like falcons overhead, minimal synths street clean some of the residual dirt, and singer-songwriter Kyle Kimball's vocals confidently press into the intimate fog. There is a brilliant light in the midst of dimness, and Night Sins is carrying the torch\n\n$22.98\n\nQuick View\n\nPerennial\n\nArt History [Kelly Green LP]\n\nVinyl: $21.98 Buy\n\nPerennial is an art project: Mod pop, post-hardcore, 60s soul, ambient electronic music, midcentury design, abstract expressionism, French New Wave cinema; its all collage material for Perennial.\n\nThe band  electric organist Chelsey Hahn, guitarist Chad Jewett and drummer Ceej Dioguardi  is equal parts manic basement show bombast and studio-as-instrument headphone listening. To see the New England three-piece in person is to experience a 20-minute burst of kinetic energy: dynamic, reckless, electrifying. To put on one of Perennials records is to spend almost the same amount of time with impeccably layered studio-as-instrument punk modernism.\n\nArt History, the bands newest full-length album (out June 6 via Ernest Jenning Record Co.), finds Perennial further experimenting with their angular cut-and-glue aesthetic. An adventurous 20 minutes of impressionist punk energy, British Invasion guitar pop chic, and Mod-inflected rhythm and noise rave-ups, Art History is both Perennials most giddily accessible and most artistically daring record to date.\n\n$21.98\n\nQuick View\n\nZeal & Ardor\n\nGreif [LP]\n\nVinyl: $22.99 PREORDER\n\nZeal & Ardor isnt just a band; its a living and breathing entity. Like any other sentient being, it consumes, evolves, and transforms from one season to the next. Its shape may change though its spirit remains the same. Founded and fronted by Manuel Gagneux, it has only sharpened its claws, lengthened its teeth, and steeled its nerves over the years, growing more undeniable and unpredictable in the process. After gathering tens of millions of streams and earning widespread critical acclaim, this beast proves as dynamic and dangerous as ever on its fourth full-length album, GREIF.\n\n$22.99\n\nQuick View\n\nPowerwolf\n\nWAKE UP THE WICKED [LP]\n\nVinyl: $29.99 Buy\n\nPOWERWOLF  a band that fills the hearts of every heavy metal fan with joy  will release their highly- anticipated new studio album, Wake Up The Wicked, on July 26, 2024 via Napalm Records! With several #1 chart entries and multiple gold and platinum records, POWERWOLF is undoubtedly one of the most successful current heavy metal bands worldwide. Headline and premium slots at premier rock and metal festivals like Wacken, Hellfest or Graspop, as well as massive sold-out arena shows have further solidified the Wolfpacks standing at the very top of the scene. POWERWOLFs high quality releases are steadily praised by critics and fans alike, building upon the successful reach of their songs and impressive official music videos, which have been streamed tens of millions of times across platforms to date.\n\nWake Up The Wicked  the highly anticipated successor to the extremely successful previous studio album, Call Of The Wild (2021)  will be released just in time for the award-winning bands first ever full North American tour, starting in August 2024, followed by their biggest European headline tour to date, the Wolfsnächte 2024. Wake Up The Wicked is once again produced by the outstanding Joost van den Broek at Sandlane Recording Facilities and marks a new benchmark and undisputed career highlight for the band. The new album is hard, surprising and full of variety. While staying true to their established, loved sound, POWERWOLF go one step further and showcase a different facet of their deft musical and technical skills. This is evident, for example, on the outstanding single 1589, which is based on a true story from the 16 th century.\n\n20 years after their formation in 2004, POWERWOLF are expanding their repertoire with the highest quality and adding many future live hits to their extraordinary discography. Wake Up The Wicked is yet another statement cementing the status of the band as a leading force in the world of heavy metal!\n\n$29.99\n\nQuick View\n\nAmen Corner\n\nWritten By The Devil\n\nCD: $16.98 Buy\n\nAmen Corner, one of Brazils Underground legends, is back!

It was their first album of new studio material since 1987's All, after which singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members (bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson) had changed the band's name to All and released eight albums between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. When Aukerman decided to return to music the group chose to operate as two acts simultaneously, playing with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All.\n\n$23.98\n\nQuick View\n\nLinkin Park\n\nPapercuts [Indie Exclusive Black & Red Splatter]\n\nVinyl: $42.99 Buy\n\nPapercuts is the first singles collection from innovative musical force Linkin Park. The career-spanning 20-track album compiles 18 essential anthems, plus the never-before-released track Friendly Fire recorded during the 2017 sessions for their seventh album One More Light and fan-favorite rarity QWERTY.\n\nLinkin Park were inspired to thoughtfully curate Papercuts by their fans passionate reception of the 20th Anniversary Editions of Hybrid Theory in 2020 and Meteora last year. That enthusiasm led to this comprehensive retrospective of the bands journey so far in the span of one album.\n\n$42.99\n\nQuick View\n\nKnocked Loose\n\nYOU WON'T GO BEFORE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO [ Indie Exclusive Half Green / Half Yellow w/ Black & White Splatter LP]\n\nVinyl: UNAVAILABLE\n\nKNOCKED LOOSE:\n\nAs Knocked Loose chipped away at what would become their third album, they felt the pressure from all sides. Internally, there was the need to challenge themselves as songwriters while retaining the merciless intensity and unflinching honesty that have always been their calling cards. Externally, there was a whole new set of eyes on the hard-touring Louisville quintet, following a banner year in which theyd brought their underground-seasoned sound to some of the worlds biggest stages, finding themselves the unlikely viral darlings of both Coachella and Bonnaroo.\n\nThe creative process was arduous, with the band writing close to 40 songs across a span of four years before locking in the 10 tracks that make up new LP You Wont Go Before Youre Supposed To. But in the end, vocalist Bryan Garris, guitarists Isaac Hale and Nicko Calderon, bassist Kevin Otten and drummer Kevin Pac Sun Kaine honed a diverse, cohesive and savagely intense album that both sums up the massive strides theyve taken during their decade as a band, and asserts their boundless potential going forward.\n\nRaging lead single Blinding Faith skillfully wields whiplash tempo changes in service of a scathing indictment of religious groupthink. Dont Reach for Me combines the bands signature frenzied attack with deliberate catchiness and refreshing sonic variety. While Suffocate, featuring pop-meets-metal trailblazer Poppy, contrasts an oppressive heaviness befitting the title with a dance-y, syncopated groove and, midway through, the most concussive reggaeton rhythm youve ever heard.\n\nThe album title  a phrase that a fellow passenger said to Garris to soothe his severe air-travel anxiety during a particularly trying flight  strikes a note of reassurance. But glossing over negative emotions isnt what Knocked Loose are about. The new songs find them plumbing new depths of loathing  directed both inward and outward  and tortuous anguish. Musically, theyre leaning into their most extreme impulses, from blastbeat-driven fury, chaotic turbulence and seismic breakdowns, while seasoning the mix with ear-catching auxiliary percussion, evocative samples and shout-along hooks, all interwoven to perfection by Grammy-nominated, pop-savy producer Drew WZRD BLD Fulk.\n\nTheres no ceiling for hardcore in 2024  even an outfit as uncompromising as Knocked Loose can turn up in mainstream-adjacent spaces and win over new fans. But theres a center to what they do that will never change: uncompromising heaviness, both sonically and thematically. What is evolving is their drive to find new ways to convey that heaviness, and add tasteful variety that only highlights their undiminished ferocity. Everywhere Knocked Loose have been is here on this record  but so is everywhere they may yet go.\n\nQuick View\n\nDarkthrone\n\nIt Beckons Us All [Indie Exclusive Purple LP]\n\nVinyl: $33.99 Buy\n\nTHE NEW, EPIC METALLIC ODYSSEY FROM THE LONGSTANDING NORWEGIAN DUO OF FENRIZ & NOCTURNO CULTO. PRESENTED ON LIMITED PURPLE VINYL WITH PRINTED INNER SLEEVE. With a legacy of audial treasures now spanning more than 35 years & with the fountain of creativity ever flowing, Norway's Darkthrone return with their latest venture through classic riffs & vintage sounding metal in the shape of the epic new seven track studio opus, 'It Beckons Us All'. Seeing the longstanding duo of Fenriz & Nocturno Culto uniting once more, 'It Beckons Us All' follows on the heels of 2022's revered 'Astral Fortress' album, with what could be considered an even more refined, challenging & diverse set of timeless metal anthems from the uncompromising trailblazers; from the melodic, to the sombre & atmospheric, to the blackened dirges emanating from Darkthrone's highly distinguishable riffing, as well as a nod to influences such as Celtic Frost along the way. Recorded once again at Chaka Khan Studios in the band's native Norway, 'It Beckons Us All' was mastered by Jack Control at Enormous Door, with artwork courtesy of Polish artist Zbigniew Bielak.\n\n$33.99\n\nQuick View\n\nCandy\n\nIts Inside You [Indie Exclusive Yellow with Splatter LP]\n\nVinyl: $28.99 Buy\n\n\"The bi-coastal quartet fleshes out classic elements of hardcore and metal with industrial, shoegaze, and noise. Even their love songs feel extreme.\" - Pitchfork\n\nCANDY return with their new album, It's Inside You. A brazen take on hardcore, metal, and disparate electronics and experimental soundscapes, It's Inside You sees CANDY take another step forward with a compelling, extreme, and one-of-a-kind take on the genre.\n\nFrom the frenzied album opener \"eXisTenZ\", CANDY's intent is clear; It's Inside You kicks off as violently as possible. Cited as thriving in \"this jumble of gothic industrial and digitized metal\" by Pitchfork, the single minute, thirty-second track twists and turns as a contorted thesis statement for what will follow. Tracks like \"Dehumanize Me\" continue this trend, establishing an interplay between ferocious hardcore stomps helmed by guitarist Michael Quick, with pulse-pounding, electronic rhythms set against this monstrous riffing. \"Dreams Less Sweet\" crashes and bashes onto the record, while vocalist Zachary Quiram mourns the modern condition: \"dreams laid dead/stuck grieving/how do you fight the feeling?/are we living in a world just to die?\"\n\nElsewhere on the record, tracks like \"Love Like Snow\" showcase a different side of the band. Electronic, mechanical melodies are set against desperate cries for human connection. It's Inside You flexes more than just muscular Hardcore brutality. \"Dancing to the Infinite Beat\" and \"Hypercore\" also see raw emotion laid bare against frenetic, electronic punishment before crescendoing into cathartic, ear-worm choruses.\n\nWith It's Inside You, CANDY signals the future for what Hardcore, Metal, and Electronics can truly be.\n\nFFO: Turnstile, Knocked Loose, Converge, Mindforce, Full of Hell, Ceremony, Code Orange\n\n$28.99\n\nQuick View\n\nUmbra Vitae\n\nLight Of Death [Indie Exclusive Clear / Bone Cloudy]\n\nVinyl: $28.99 Buy\n\n\"Light Of Death\" is the 15 song sophomore album from Umbra Vitae. Recorded by Kurt Ballou and Zach Weeks at God City Studios and mastered by Brad Boatright at Audiosiege. \"Leave Of Absence\" emerges with a spine-chilling violin swell before erupting into duel guitar driven madness courtesy of Sean Martin (Twitching Tongues, ex-Hatebreed) and Mike McKenzie (The Red Chord). Umbra Vitae stay redlined with \"Belief Is Obsolete\" and \"Clear Cutter\", showcasing the electrifying rhythm section of Jon Rice (Uncle Acid, Tsjuder) and Greg Weeks (The Red Chord). Hook-laden \"Anti-Spirit Machine\" then takes center stage as a war cry for the downtrodden. From here Umbra Vitae continue to smash and thrash everything in sight. The discordant \"Reality In Retrograde\" races with a grinding blur into the lumbering \"Past Tense\" and darkly seductive \"Velvet Black\". Two songs that are metallic heaviness incarnate. \"Twenty-Twenty Vision\", \"Algorithm Of Fear\", and \"Empty Vessel\" then pick up the intensity, propelled by the poignant lyrical themes and inhuman vocal deliveries of Jacob Bannon (Converge). Lastly, the trinity of slow-crawl \"Cause & Effect\", ultra-violent \"Deep End\", and whirlwind \"Nature vs. Nurture\" continue to bludgeon, ushering in the interlinked \"Fatal Flaw\" and \"Light Of Death\" as the vicious finale to this modern metal masterpiece.\n\n$28.99\n\nQuick View\n\nGEL\n\nPersona [Indie Exclusive]\n\nVinyl: $19.98 UNAVAILABLE\n\nGEL return with a new 5-track EP, Persona, to make their Blue Grape Music debut.

Big in two waysfor hardcore kids from Sydney, playing good shows worldwide, proudly representing their scene. And second, for any band from the scene playing hard music, crossing over hard into the larger world. Its quick work to find SPEED doing both: headlining shows in England, New York, Japan, globally, turning in blazing sets at Sound & Fury and This Is Hardcore, among other massive heavy music festivals. Seven-figure viewed videostheir set at S&F, short films for their songsand tunes headlining video game soundtracks. Famous folks wearing their jerseys, people new to the scene showing up to more gigs. SPEED know that because of these global crossover moments, they might be some peoples first hardcore band; the idea is that theyll get introduced not only to SPEED, but also to the scene and the people behind it.
