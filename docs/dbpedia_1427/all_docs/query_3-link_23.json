        "text": "A vinyl record is a type of gramophone, or phonograph, record. It is an analog sound storage medium where sound is inscribed in a modulated spiral groove. The earliest recordings were on cylinders, but they are most commonly recorded on discs.\n\nThe phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison. The phonograph used inscribed wax or celluloid cylinders to record and play back sound. In 1899, Emile Berliner invented the gramophone. Early gramophone records differed from phonograph records as they used inscribed discs of celluloid or rubber to record and play back sound.\n\nAround 1895, shellac discs became the standard. Shellac would be the most common type of gramophone record until vinyl records were introduced in 1931. Vinyl records were the standard for commercial audio media released to the public until 1988, when the medium was superseded by the digital compact disc.\n\nIn 2015, a picture disc vinyl record of The President's Album, narrated by Ronald Reagan and adorned with his face, was available for sale at the Blast from the Past antique/memorabilia store.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe soundtrack for each film in the Back to the Future trilogy was released on vinyl record.\n\n[]\n\nGramophone record on Wikipedia\n\nAppearances[]"
