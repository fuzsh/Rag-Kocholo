        "text": "- November 24th, 2023 –\n\nChristmas time is here again! King Diamond‘s No Presents for Christmas was originally released in 1985 and now Metal Blade Records is reissuing this 2-track classic on vinyl, just in time for Black Friday. No Presents for Christmas features new cover art and is available worldwide in two new vinyl colors. Side 1 features the title track, “No Presents for Christmas” and Side 2 features “Charon” (from “Fatal Portrait”). In honor of the release, the band has also worked with their US merch company to offer a lithograph signed by King Diamond himself.\n\nHere’s what King had to say: “We are very happy to make No Presents for Christmas available on vinyl again, and with a brand new cover! Livia worked on the glass mansion on the cover – it’s a mansion she designed that I just loved and said we must use this for something! The cover came out exactly how we wanted it to, and it looks like something you would find in the Christmas albums aisle alongside Frank Sinatra. It has the Christmas feeling, but with something dark and sinister when you examine it more closely. I look like a ghost – the ghost of trying to destroy Christmas! This is the first King Diamond song that was ever released and was originally performed live back in December of 1985, it’s very special to us and we hope you enjoy No Presents for Christmas as much as we do!“\n\nFans worldwide can find the vinyl at: metalblade.com/kingdiamond and North American Fans can grab the signed lithograph at store.kingdiamondcoven.com. King‘s even curated a shirt for you to wear to all of your Holiday festivities at: US: store.kingdiamondcoven.com – EU: eustore.kingdiamondcoven.com\n\nUS Variant : Black / White Melt\n\nEU Variant: White with Red Splatter\n\nRelease Lineup:\n\nKing Diamond – vocals, guitars\n\nAndy LaRocque – guitars\n\nMichael Denner – guitars\n\nTimi Hansen – bass\n\nMikkey Dee – drums\n\nIn other King Diamond news, the band recently released a music video for the single “Masquerade of Madness” with David Brodsky and Allison Woest of MyGoodEye Visuals, which can be viewed HERE!\n\nAbout the band:\n\nKING DIAMOND is quite possibly the most recognizable and prolific personality ever in heavy metal. Revered by icons as big as Metallica and Pantera to inspiring new upstarts like Goatwhore; KING DIAMOND, the man and the band, have left an indelible mark on the history, and now again, the future of heavy metal.\n\nIn August of 2008, KING DIAMOND joined Metallica on stage at Ozzfest in Dallas to perform the Mercyful Fate medley made famous from the Garage, Inc. album. Additionally, KING DIAMOND was featured alongside Motorhead‘s Lemmy Kilmister as a playable character in Guitar Hero: Metallica in 2009.\n\nBy 2012, KING DIAMOND was prepared to return to the stage for a select number of shows. The band’s triumphant return to the stage were the highlights of both the Hellfest and Sweden Rock festivals in France and Sweden. Fans at these festivals were treated to the largest and most involved stage production in the band’s storied history. Horror concepts from multiple albums were used in the décor; fans can rest-assured that this show will only get larger and more impressive at future performances.\n\nKING DIAMOND continued to hit the stage from 2013 to 2018 including performances at Rock Hard Festival (DE), Copenhell (DK), Graspop (BE), Metal Days (SI), Bloodstock Open Air (UK), Loudpark (JP), Wacken Open Air (DE), a 2014 North American tour with Jess and the Ancient Ones, Fun Fun Fun Fest (US), toured as a part of the 2015 Mayhem Festival in the summer (US), a fall 2015 North American tour with Exodus as special guests, Sweden Rock fest (SE), Hellfest (FR),and Psycho Las Vegas (US).\n\nIn 2019, after the release of the KING DIAMOND‘S first new single in 12 years “Masquerade of Madness“, the band hit the road with a series of live shows in Europe including stops at Summer Breeze festival (DE), Graspop (BE), Hellfest (FR), Rock Fest (ES), and with Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats and Idle Hands as special guests for 19 dates across North America.\n\nKING DIAMOND‘s 30+ year musical career is one of the most storied in history of heavy metal, but the tale is not yet over. The most recent release, 2007′s Grammy nominated album Give Me Your Soul…Please, stands as one of the most critically-acclaimed albums in an already iconic discography. Future albums will feature entirely new horror stories, concepts, haunting orchestrations, and the band’s signature brand of heavy metal from the mind of KING DIAMOND and the talented group of musicians: Andy LaRocque – Guitar, Mike Wead – Guitar, Pontus Egberg – Bass, Matt Thompson – Drums. Many more albums, tours, and ventures lay ahead.\n\nKing Diamond online:\n\nhttps://www.kingdiamondcoven.com\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kingdiamond\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kingdiamond\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/kingdiamond"
