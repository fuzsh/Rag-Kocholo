        "text": "We hope music fans will enjoy this new Eonian Records title, I’m in Rewind. REWIND is a killer-sounding rock/metal band with heavy, dragging grooves, fat guitar riffs, and creative, twisted lyrics! Their third release, and first through Eonian Records, was produced by Mick Perez (Jones Street, Warrior) , and exceptional final mastering by Anthony Focx (Aerosmith, Buckcherry, Daughtry, Shinedown) will entice and enthrall the band’s new and old fans.\n\nGermany’s RockHard Magazine honored REWIND and their self-released sophomore release Moment in Time, as one of its “Top Ten Unsigned Metal Bands” and awarded it a stellar 9 out of 10 rating. REWIND was packing venues and featured an “A-List” of top studio and touring musicians including drummer Dave DuCey (Warrior, Rhino Bucket). You would be remiss if you did not check out this soon-to-be metal classic from REWIND. Do not miss I’m In Rewind!\n\nCheck out “Third Time Second Chance”, “Her Eyes”, and “The Lonely Ones” and tell us that you couldn’t hear them cranking out of every car window on an ‘80s summer evening. This album is a wonderfully infectious and energetic pop metal treat, and we could not be more excited to bring it to you remastered Anthony Focx (Aerosmith, Buckcherry, Daughtry, Shinedown) with a stunningly beautiful booklet, band bio and chock-full of never seen photos from the band’s personal archives.\n\nGrab your copies early as we have a feeling this one may sell out fast! If you love Trixter, Poison, Pretty Boy Floyd, then this release will thrive in your rotation. A very special thank you to Bob Long at Shandi’s Music & More for the introduction to the band!\n\nFormed in the summer of 2021, WANTED is a band with the distinct goal of resurrecting traditional, loud, melodic metal that ruled the airwaves throughout the 1980s. The band’s main influences consist of RATT, DOKKEN, & VAN HALEN. Metal Forces Magazine’s Neil Arnold on WANTED:\n\n“Chain Reaction” is one of the BIGGEST surprises of the year!” 9/10\n\n“When I first put this CD in, I played the first three songs at least five times in a row, stunned by their effortless grace, but I also gulped in the darker guitar work!”\n\n“Late Attraction” is such a fantastic album that struts like VAN HALEN or EXTREME… another classy slice of hard rock from a band that has the mercurial talent which should, of common sense prevails, catapult them to the dizzy heights of stardom!” 9/10\n\n“From the raunchy rendezvous of RATT to the dreamy fires of DOKKEN, WANTED explores known themes to melodious effect!”\n\nThe band's debut, \"Chain Reaction\" features Nate Peck, 2023 \"American Idol\" golden ticket recipient from Season 21, who recently joined FIREHOUSE as the band’s new lead vocalist.\n\nBeautiful packaging with the utmost attention to quality and detail! Most importantly, AMAZING musicianship, sound, and production! Grab a copy while you can… Limited Pressing of 500. An absolute MUST have!\n\nTOMMI GUNN needs little to no introduction as it has been on top of every collector’s wish list for decades. TOMMI GUNN “Talk of the Town” features each of the 15 studio recordings from 1985 to 1989. The master reels were baked, digitalized, & remastered by Anthony Focx (Ace Frehley, Aerosmith, Foreigner, L.A. Guns) providing “Talk of the Town” the overall feeling & sound signature the band had always intended. The sound is top shelf!\n\nEonian Records also spared no expense on the level of detail of the booklet, as it comes with everything you’ve come to expect from the in-depth history of TOMMI GUNN’S time from Chicago to Hollywood and loaded with never-before-seen photos. We consider this to be an essential piece of Hollywood Sunset Strip history and a must for ALL collectors.\n\nStop us if you have heard this. It’s 1987. Hollywood, with all its style & sounds, is exploding. Five California kids and a guy from Alabama come together with a shared dream - making it big on the Sunset Strip! Five guys, busting their asses on the legendary stages of Hollywood. Five musicians, following the path of their musical heroes, shared the bill with others who were pursuing the same dream. Five guys walking the streets of Hollywood, plastering posters & flyers anywhere they would stick and be seen, hustling to sell tickets to fill the clubs.\n\nWhile the RARE TOUCH story may be like that of other bands, these songs are uniquely their own and thirty-plus years later, the band’s legacy lives on with this collection of never-released songs and beautiful booklet detailing their journey.\n\nLYPSWITCH started off with Eonian Records a decade ago on the four-disc box set “Rock ‘N’ Roll Rebels & The Sunset Strip.” Fast forward and the two have joined forces to release a historic collection of their studio recordings, including three new songs. In the early days, LYPSWITCH categorized their sound as “underground punk-funk street rock.” When the guys arrived in Hollywood via Orlando in April of 1988, the glam scene was morphing to a more street-level sound, so they did not have to adapt much to fit in; however, the band’s sound naturally got more down & dirty.\n\nIf you are a fan of Guns N’ Roses, L.A. Guns, Bang Tango, Love/Hate, and Funhouse, LYPSWITCH is for you! We consider this an essential piece of Los Angeles music history.\n\nIf you were one of the lucky ones who own an original copy of the band’s self-released “Strawberry Jam” EP, it fetches for a pretty penny nowadays. Combining the old with the new, “Phoenix,” the new album from SPLIT IMAGE provides six tracks remixed & remastered from the original “Strawberry Jam” master reels and six newly recorded tracks. Twelve rocking tracks in the vein of Dokken & Tyketto that encapsulate the true sound of one of Central Florida’s most promising Rock acts from the early ‘90s.\n\n“Phoenix” also features Ross Childress, original lead guitarist & co-songwriter for the rock band Collective Soul, as well as Adin Stickle, singer, songwriter, & guitarist of The Thrill, as well as the guitarist of Slippery When Wet. Truly an essential piece to any Melodic Hard Rock collection!\n\nHere we have the first album from the band 415, which later changed the name of the band to Eric Martin Band, which released the album Sucker For A Pretty Face. The band was fronted by none other than Eric Martin before he helped form Mr. Big. The band also had John Nymann on guitar before he joined Y&T.\n\nThis original album features Journey frontman Steve Perry singing guest backing vocals on the song \"I’m Alone.” The album Area Code 415 is packed with super catchy radio-friendly songs!\n\nHere we have the 2nd album from 415, Boys Night Out. This album was produced by Gregg Rolie from Santana and Journey. Again, this band features amazing lead vocals from Eric Martin (pre-Mr. Big) and guitars from John Nymann (pre-Y&T). Keyboardist Dave Jacobsen would later go on to tour with UFO.\n\nThe Boys Night Out album was recorded in August of 1981 at Fantasy Studios (The same studio Journey recorded their album Escape). This was to be the band’s sophomore album after Area Code 415.\n\nMastermind and vocalist Brett Kelly has assembled a team of rockers that will bring the fun back to your sound systems with songs inspired by the golden age of glam metal, such as the anthemic “80s Ladies” and “VHS,” heart-wrenching tales of love gone wrong with songs like “Last Call For Love” and “Ship Of Fools,” and headbanging songs like “If You See Kay” and “If You Can’t Do What’s Right (Do Wha’'s Left).”\n\nThe album features co-writing with Mike Trebilcock (the Juno award-winning singer of The Killjoys) and is mastered by Harry Hess (of Harem Scarem fame).\n\nThis ambitious project features entirely new music from Keel’s notable projects: Ron Keel Band, Steeler, Keel, IronHorse, Emerald Sabbath, and solo material. These are NOT leftovers from the vault or previously unreleased tracks—Keelworld consists of FRESH songs (except for the Black Sabbath cover) and new recordings that capture the original style and spirit of the bands on the tracklist. All physical versions will include a 12-page “comic book” style booklet containing comic-sized versions of iconic photos from all eras.\n\n“Keelworld is a unique ride across all the musical landscapes I’ve called home the past five decades—from the heavy metal jungle to the red dirt roads of country music,” Ron explains. “As diverse as the songs are, even with the stark contrast between styles, the album has a cohesive sonic identity, and the pieces fit together just as I hoped they would.”\n\nPrepare to be baptized in the fiery soundwaves of EVE’S BITE as they drop their latest musical arsenal, Blessed In Hell. Hailing from the Metal hotbed of Saint-Étienne, France, this quartet is not your run-of-the-mill metal act; they’re a sonic force fueled by passion, power, and a dash of devilish originality.\n\nBlessed In Hell isn’t just an album; it’s a sonic manifesto. EVE’S BITE throws a Molotov cocktail of influences into their cauldron, resulting in a concoction of punchy riffs, infectious refrains, and pleasant and haunting melodies. If you’re nostalgic for the golden era of Metal in the ‘80s, EVE’S BITE is about to transport you back in time while adding its own devilish twist.\n\nAn absolute MUST-have!\n\nRock ‘n’ Roll Rebels & the Sunset Strip were the final wave of Sunset Strip bands, the most competitive market for rock ‘n’ roll that had ever existed. During this era (1980s/Early 90s), the Sunset Strip had become a living, breathing entity of extreme depth and breadth of musicality, self-indulgence, and living in the intrepidly fast and dangerous lane. This boxset is a four-disc collection with 36 Bands and 72 Digitally Remastered Studio Recordings. This collection also features a 60-Page Booklet with a close up look at each band, Over 100 Original Archived Photos, and the 13-Page “Rock ‘n’ Roll Rebels: Sunset Strip Certified” Bio narrated by JohnnyX of The Wild and Adam Gifford of Paradise, both well-known bands on the Sunset Strip."
