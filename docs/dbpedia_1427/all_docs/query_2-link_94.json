        "text": "Just like any medium for music, there is only so much space you can use to transcribe music onto. Vinyl records share the same limitation and can represent a limited playtime accurately.\n\nA standard 12-inch 33 RPM vinyl record can have a playtime of roughly 22 minutes per side for a total of 44 minutes. A 7-inch 45 RPM record can fit approximately 5 minutes per side for a total of 10 minutes. Generally, any longer, the sound quality would start to deteriorate.\n\nThese are the two most common types of records and covers a majority of the market. However, there are many other standards at play, and when purchasing antique albums.\n\nPlaying Times of the Many Vinyl Variations\n\nThe playing time of a vinyl record depends on total groove length. Groove length is a product of the diameter of the record and how tightly the grooves are packed together.\n\nListed below are the most common sizes and RPMs you may come across and the advised max runtimes of the combination determined by manufacturers.\n\nSize RPM Runtime per Side 12-inch 33 RPM 22 minutes 12-inch 45 RPM 15 minutes 12-inch 78 RPM 5 minutes 7-inch 33 RPM 7 minutes 7-inch 45 RPM 5 minutes 10-inch 33 RPM 15 minutes 10-inch 45 RPM 12 minutes 10-inch 78 RPM 3 minutes\n\nIn the early days of vinyl records, 78 RPM was the most common and only provided a total of 10 minutes of runtime. When sound was introduced into movies, the short runtime of these 78 RPM records was insufficient and required longer playtimes.\n\nIn 1948 Columbia Records introduced “long players,” or more commonly referred to as an “LP.” LPs were to fulfill the need of longer playtimes by spinning the record at a slower 33 RPM. Reducing the speed so drastically was possible through “microgrooves.”\n\nMicrogrooves are just a smaller groove within the vinyl record. These microgrooves required a needle stylus nearly one third the size of a 78 RPM stylus.\n\nOur playtimes have not increased much since then. LPs were a set standard and have stood the test of time.\n\nA 12-inch @ 33RPM or an “LP” with microgrooves is by far the most common in modern pressings, which provides you a total of 44 minutes of music on a single record.\n\nNext up would be your “45s” or 7-inch @ 45 RPM records. 45s are going to be a much shorter 5 minutes, totaling up to 10 minutes for both sides. This limitation results in being able to fit a song or two on each side.\n\n78 RPM records have not been commonly produced since the 50s’. The higher speed of rotation drastically lowers the playtime of an LP to the same duration of a 45.\n\n78 RPM records generally came in a 10-inch variant and made from shellac, unlike modern vinyl records which are made primarily from PVC. 12-inch 78 RPM records were primarily reserved for classical music.\n\nExtended Play and the Affect on Quality\n\nShortly after the release of LPs, RCA Victor introduced the “extended play” or EP record to compete with Columbia Records. EPs initially referred to 45s that contained more than a single song per side and later refined to any music album containing 4 or more tracks.\n\nThese records were able to cram in an extra 2-3 minutes per side of a 7-inch 45 by reducing the size of the grooves at the cost of losing some fidelity.\n\nThese smaller grooves reduced the dynamic range of the record. Other side effects include quieter play and more prone to damage by a dirty needle.\n\nAn EP generally had a runtime of 10-15 minutes. Some examples of EPs include:\n\nElvis Presley’s 1956 EP Love Me Tender\n\nThe Beatles 1967 EP Magical Mystery Tour\n\nThe Kinks 1964 EP Kinksize Session\n\nColumbia Records then followed up by releasing an “extended-play” LP. A 12-inch 33 RPM record with smaller and tighter grooves.\n\nThese extended-play LPs allowed a single 12-inch record to have a total playtime of 52 minutes or 26 minutes per side. Broadway plays often made use of extended-play LPs, to reduce further the need to flip and exchange records.\n\nAlthough, there have been some releases that have broken the mold:\n\nTodd Rundgren’s 1973 album A Wizard, a True Star where side B nearly reached a 30-minute playtime.\n\nLa Monte Young and Marian Zazeela’s 1974 album Dream House 78’ 17” had an astonishing playtime of 78 minutes long, 39 minutes per side.\n\nArthur Fiedler’s 1976 LP 90 Minutes with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops as the title states had a mind-blowing 90 minutes of playtime.\n\nMany of these records saw a drastic loss in quality by extending the playtime so far.\n\n33 RPM vs 45 RPM\n\nYou may be wondering why anybody would want a 45 RPM over a 33 RPM record if it reduces the playtime so drastically. It all comes down to quality.\n\n45 RPM records, in contrast to 33 RPM, are traditionally louder and provide a broader dynamic range due to wider grooves. At the cost of reducing the available playtime of the record by 35%.\n\nWhat this means is that a 45 RPM single will should better than the same song on a 33 RPM LP although this does not always hold.\n\nAs the needle moves closer to the center of the record, the quality of the sound decreases ever so slightly. The record has to store the same length of music over a shorter distance in the grooves.\n\nExtending on this logic a 12-inch 45 RPM record, which is a rising format, is going to be better than any 12-inch 33 RPM record.\n\nFurthermore, due to the fact, the sound deteriorates as you get closer to the center of the platter. The expanded circumference of a 12-inch 45 RPM record of a 7-inch 45 RPM record will provide another increase of fidelity.\n\nIn my experience, the production quality of 45s has been a bit hit or miss. However, when I do receive a well-pressed 45, I can immediately tell by the impactful bass provided by the broader dynamic range."
