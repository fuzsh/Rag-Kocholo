sector. The mainstay of the Burundian economy is agriculture, accounting for 32.9% of GDP in 2008. Agriculture supports more than 70% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers. Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil war, overpopulation, and soil erosion have contributed to the contraction of the subsistence economy by 25% in recent years.

The Ethiopian government is in the process of privatizing many of the state-owned businesses and moving toward a market economy. However, the banking, telecommunication and transportation sectors of the economy are dominated by government-owned companies. Ethiopia has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is Africa’s second most populous country. Many properties owned by the government during the previous regime have now been privatized and are in the process of privatization. However, certain sectors such as telecommunications, financial and insurance services, air and land transportation services, and retail, are considered as strategic sectors and are expected to remain under state control for the foreseeable future. Almost 50% of Ethiopia's population is under the age of 18, and even though education enrollment at primary and tertiary level has increased significantly, job creation has not caught up with the increased output from educational institutes. The country must create hundreds of thousands of jobs every year just to keep up with population growth. The Ethiopian constitution defines the right to own land as belonging only to \"the state and the people\", but citizens may only lease land (up to 99 years), and are unable to mortgage, sell, or own it. Various groups and political parties have sought for full privatization of land, while other opposition parties are against privatization and favor communal ownership. The current government has embarked on a program of economic reform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of government regulation. While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have begun to attract much-needed foreign investment.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Ethiopia\n\nEconomy of Georgia (country)\n\nThe economy of Georgia is an emerging free market.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Georgia (country)\n\nEconomy of Guadeloupe\n\nThe economy of Guadeloupe depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Guadeloupe\n\nEconomy of Iran\n\nThe economy of Iran is a mixed and transition economy with a large public sector.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Iran\n\nEconomy of Isan\n\nThe economy of Isan, Thailand's largest region, composed of 20 provinces in the northeast, is dominated by agriculture, although agricultural output is low and decreasing in importance while the trade and service sectors are growing.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Isan\n\nEconomy of Jamaica\n\nJamaica has natural resources, primarily bauxite, and an ideal climate conducive to agriculture and also tourism.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Jamaica\n\nEconomy of Japan\n\nThe economy of Japan is a highly developed and market-oriented economy.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Japan\n\nEconomy of Jersey\n\nThe economy of Jersey is largely driven by international financial services and legal services, which accounted for 40.5% of total GVA in 2010.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Jersey\n\nEconomy of Laos\n\nThe economy of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is rapidly growing, as a result of decentralized government control and encouragement of private enterprise since 1986.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Laos\n\nEconomy of Malaysia\n\nThe economy of Malaysia is the 4th largest in Southeast Asia, and is the 38th largest economy in the world.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Malaysia\n\nEconomy of Mongolia\n\nEconomic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based on agriculture and livestock.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Mongolia\n\nEconomy of Morocco\n\nThe economy of Morocco is considered a relatively liberal economy governed by the law of supply and demand.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Morocco\n\nEconomy of Nicaragua\n\nNicaragua's economy is focused primarily on the agricultural sector.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Nicaragua\n\nEconomy of Nigeria\n\nNigeria is a middle-income, mixed economy and emerging market, with expanding manufacturing, financial, service, communications, technology and entertainment sectors.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Nigeria\n\nEconomy of Panama\n\nThe economy of Panama is a fully dollarized economy with a history of low inflation.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Panama\n\nEconomy of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe economy of Saudi Arabia is dependent on oil and has strong government control over major economic activities.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Saudi Arabia\n\nEconomy of São Tomé and Príncipe\n\nThe economy of São Tomé and Príncipe, while traditionally dependent on cocoa, is experiencing considerable changes due to investment in the development of its oil industry in the oil-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of São Tomé and Príncipe\n\nEconomy of Somalia\n\nSomalia is classified by the United Nations as a least developed country.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Somalia\n\nEconomy of Sri Lanka\n\nWith an economy worth $93.45 billion $298.310 billion PPP and a per capita GDP of about $4,310, $13,480 PPP as of 2018 Sri Lanka has mostly had strong growth rates in recent years.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of Sri Lanka\n\nEconomy of the Isle of Man\n\nThe Isle of Man, one of the Crown dependencies, is a low-tax economy and offshore financial centre.\n\nSee Construction and Economy of the Isle of Man\n\nEconomy of the Netherlands\n\nAccording to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the Netherlands was the 18th largest economy of the world in 2012, while the country has only about 17 million inhabitants. (see: List of countries by GDP (nominal)). GDP per capita is roughly $48,860 which makes it one of richest nations in the world (see: List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). Between 1996 and 2000 annual economic growth (GDP) averaged over 4%, well above the European average. Growth slowed considerably in 2001–05 as part of the global economic slowdown. 2006 and 2007 however showed economic growth of 3.4% and 3.9%. The Dutch economy was hit considerably by the ongoing global financial crisis and the ensuing European debt crisis. The Netherlands has discovered huge natural gas resources since 1959. The sale of natural gas generated enormous revenues for the Netherlands for decades, adding hundreds of billions of euros to the government's budget. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's huge energy wealth impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease. The Netherlands have a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on foreign trade. The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly low unemployment and inflation, a very big sizable current account surplus (compared to the size of the country even more than Germany) and an important role as a European transportation hub, with Rotterdam as by far the biggest port in Europe and Amsterdam with one of the biggest airports in Europe. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, hightech, financial services, creative sector and electrical machinery. A highly mechanised agricultural sector employs no more than 2% of the labour force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The stern financial policy has been abandoned in 2009 because of the current credit crises. The relatively large banking sector was partly nationalised and bailed out through government interventions. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.0% in the summer of 2011, but increased with a sharp rate since then to 7.3% in May 2013, 6.8% in 2015 but dropped again to 3.9% in March 2018. The state budget deficit is about 2.2% in 2015 well below the norm of 3.0% in the EU. In 2016 the state budget showed a surplus of 0.4% and this is expected to grow to a surplus of over 1.0% in 2017.

Often nicknamed the \"Ivy League\" and \"Rolls Royce\" of organized crime, the Genovese crime family are rivaled in size only by the Gambino crime family, and are unmatched in terms of power. They have generally maintained a varying degree of influence over many of the smaller mob families outside New York, including ties with the Philadelphia, Patriarca, and Buffalo crime families. The current \"family\" was founded by Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, and was known as the \"Luciano crime family\" from 1931 to 1957, when it was renamed after boss Vito Genovese. Originally in control of the waterfront on the West Side of Manhattan and the Fulton Fish Market, the family was run for years by \"the Oddfather\", Vincent \"the Chin\" Gigante, who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York's Greenwich Village wearing a tattered bath robe and muttering to himself incoherently to avoid prosecution. The Genovese family is the oldest and the largest of the \"Five Families\". Finding new ways to make money in the 21st century, the family took advantage of lax due diligence by banks during the housing bubble with a wave of mortgage frauds. Prosecutors say loan shark victims obtained home equity loans to pay off debts to their mob bankers. The family found ways to use new technology to improve on illegal gambling, with customers placing bets through offshore sites via the Internet. Although the leadership of the Genovese family seemed to have been in limbo after the death of Gigante in 2005, they appear to be the most organized family and remain powerful. - the wiretap network - wmob.com Unique in today's Mafia, the family has benefited greatly from members following the code of Omertà.
