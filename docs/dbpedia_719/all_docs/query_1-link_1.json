        "text": "Bosnian singer, songwriter, record producer (born 1962)\n\nMusical artist\n\nEdin Dervišhalidović (born 12 September 1962), known professionally as Dino Merlin, is a Bosnian singer-songwriter and record producer.[1][2] Born in Sarajevo, he was the founder and leader of Merlin, which was one of the best-selling rock bands of Southeast Europe.[3][4]\n\nNicknamed \"The Wizard\" (Bosnian: Čarobnjak), Dino is considered one of the most prominent and commercially successful artists ever to emerge from the former Yugoslavia.[5] Over the course of his career, he has produced over a dozen chart-topping albums,[6] gone on several record-breaking tours,[7] won awards including the Sixth of April Sarajevo Award,[8] and authored the first national anthem of (the Republic of) Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is widely known for his distinctive voice, stage performances, and poetic lyrics.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nEdin Dervišhalidović was born on 12 September 1962, in the neighborhood of Alifakovac in Sarajevo, People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (at the time part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).[1] His father, Abid, was a carpenter who came to Sarajevo as a teenager. His mother, Fatima (née Činjarević), was born and raised in Sarajevo, and was a Muslim cleric.[9] His parents divorced when he was 7 years old and he was subsequently raised by his mother.[10]\n\nDervišhalidović attended Moris Moco Salom primary school (today \"Edhem Mulabdić\" elementary school), where he was the captain of the school's soccer, basketball, and table tennis teams. The school and its significant surroundings – Emperor's Mosque, President Tito's konak, and Hotel Nacional – influenced his later art.[1]\n\nDervišhalidović enrolled at Sarajevo Technical High School. During after-school hours, he performed in a music duo with his childhood friend and keyboardist Mensur Lutvica, with whom he later established the band Merlin.\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough Dervišhalidović's mother was against the idea of her son being a musician, she helped him buy his first guitar when he was 12 years old.[11] He penned his first song at 14 years old. Dervišhalidović was mostly self-taught, although he did take a few lessons from an older neighbor named Mirsad. Mirsad's younger brother, Mensur Lutvica, played the keyboard and attended the same school as Dervišhalidović. They soon became friends and eventually became the founding members of the later band 'Merlin'. Lutvica began accompanying Dervišhalidović while performing on the streets of Sarajevo.\n\nDervišhalidović was heavily influenced by the Yugoslavian musicians Bijelo Dugme, Zdravko Čolić, Kemal Monteno, and Toma Zdravković, among others.[12] He entered several music competitions covering their songs. He later became close friends with Goran Bregović, the founder and primary songwriter of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nAfter enrolling in university, Dervišhalidović formed a band with Lutvica on keyboard, Amir \"Tula\" Bjelanović on guitar, Džafer Saračević on drums, and Enver Milišić on bass guitar. Each of the five put a paper with their idea for a band name in a hat; the name \"Merlin\" was pulled and chosen as the name of the band.[13]\n\nMerlin\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter completing his first semester at university, Dervišhalidović dropped out to pursue a music career. However, he did not have enough money to rent a recording studio. During this time, he married his girlfriend Amela and worked two shifts a day at a metal factory in the suburbs of Sarajevo for a few years.[14] It was during this time that he started writing most of the songs which would later appear on his first album.\n\nIn 1984, Dervišhalidović rented a local studio in Sarajevo owned by producer Brano Likić. Dervišhalidović wrote all the recorded songs and paid the recording fees from his funds. He was rejected by every major record label in Sarajevo. At the same time, Dervišhalidović's private funds were only enough for 6 songs. During the recording session for the final song, a local A&R agent named Muradif Brkić entered the studio where Dervišhalidović and Likić were mixing a song. After listening to the track, \"Kokuzna Vremena\", a couple of times, Brkić offered Dervišhalidović a contract with his record label Sarajevo Disk and agreed to finance the remainder of the song recordings. Merlin eventually released their first album in 1985 titled Kokuzna vremena.[15] With the band, Dervišhalidović has recorded 5 studio albums: Kokuzna vremena in 1985, Teško meni sa tobom in 1986, Merlin in 1987, Nešto lijepo treba da se desi in 1989, and Peta strana svijeta in 1990.\n\nSolo career\n\n[edit]\n\nDervišhalidović began his solo career under the name Dino Merlin in 1991 and has since recorded six studio albums: Moja bogda sna in 1993, Fotografija in 1995, Sredinom in 2000, Burek in 2004, Ispočetka in 2008, and Hotel Nacional in 2014.\n\nDuring the Bosnian War, several members of Merlin were killed, including their long-time manager Kemal Bisić, with whom Dino was close.[16]\n\nNot long after the band dissolved, Dino was invited by the Bosnian state government to write the country's first-ever national anthem \"Jedna si jedina\". The song acted as the state's national anthem until the late 1990s.[17] In 1993, he wrote the song \"Sva bol svijeta\" (\"All the grief in the world\") for and eventually participated in Bosnia's first Eurovision Song Contest in Millstreet in 1993.[18] The song is about the hardships Bosnians endured during the war and calls for peace. He again participated in the Eurovision Song Contests in Jerusalem in 1999 (singing \"Putnici\" with Béatrice Poulot, a French singer) and in 2011 with \"Love in Rewind\".[18] Dervišhalidović has also taken part in other big European festivals, such as the Copenhagen festival in 1996 and the Turkovision Song Contest in 1997.[19]\n\nBreaking records, major success\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, aged 38, Dino released his most successful album to date - Sredinom (\"Middle\"). The album was a top-selling album in Bosnia and Herzegovina and was sold in all of the former Yugoslav republics.[20]\n\nThe album became a classic and was the highest-selling album in the region in 30 years. Some estimates put the album sales at about 2,000,000.[21]\n\nThe subsequent tour promoting Sredinom included over 200 concerts with a performance at the Koševo City Stadium in Sarajevo in front of an audience of about 80,000. This was the largest crowd ever to assemble in the national stadium in Bosnia's history.[21] Dervišhalidović subsequently performed three more times at this stadium and is the only artist ever to have filled this venue on four occasions.\n\nCurrent success, Billboard recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, Dino returned to the stage with his eleventh album Hotel Nacional.[22] It was released in June 2014 and was featured in the top 10 on the Billboard World Albums list upon release due to unprecedented online sales in the region.[23][24] This is the only album from Slavic-speaking Europe ever to chart on Billboard. The album featured Yoad Nevo, Richard Niles, Hüsnü Şenlendirici, and others.[22] 700,000 people attended The Hotel National World Tour across 4 continents. It is the largest tour ever to have been produced by an artist from Southeast Europe.[25]\n\nDino released his song \"Mi\" in October 2019, followed by \"Dođi\" at the start of 2021, and two more songs (\"Mir svim dobrim ljudima\" and \"Jedan dan, jedna noć\") in May.[26]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDino resides in his hometown of Sarajevo, in the same house and street where he was born and raised, in the neighborhood of Alifakovac. He has two children, Naida[27] and Hamza.[28]\n\nDino is an avid chess player, skier, art collector, and reader. He also owns a record label and store, Magaza, in the center of Sarajevo, in Baščaršija.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nDino is an active donor to scholarships for underprivileged children in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is a long-time member of the Hastor Foundation, the biggest organization devoted to distributing scholarships to students in the country. He sponsors over a dozen students each year and has been a member of this program since 2008.[29]\n\nDino worked for five years pro bono as the honorary and de facto president of the assembly of AMUS, the main association of music artists of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[30] He was one of the founding members of the organization in 2013.[31] In early 2018, he resigned from his position due to the lack of time to do the work.[30]\n\nDino has played numerous charity concerts. During the 2014 Southeast Europe floods, his team was heavily involved in humanitarian work, distributing water, food, blankets and other provisions to the most endangered parts of Bosnia and Serbia.[32][33]\n\nIn 2013, Dino was awarded the International Humanitarian Award in Urfa, Turkey.[34]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nMerlin\n\n[edit]\n\nKokuzna vremena (1985)\n\nTeško meni sa tobom (a još teže bez tebe) (1986)\n\nMerlin (1987)\n\nNešto lijepo treba da se desi (1989)\n\nPeta strana svijeta (1990)\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nMoja bogda sna (1993)\n\nFotografija (1995)\n\nSredinom (2000)\n\nBurek (2004)\n\nIspočetka (2008)\n\nHotel Nacional (2014)\n\nCompilation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Best of Dino Merlin (2001)\n\nDVDs\n\n[edit]\n\nLive Koševo 2004 (2005)\n\nKoševo 19.
