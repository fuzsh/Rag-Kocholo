        "text": "Reviewed By Beingbored\n\nWe did the \"special\" trip to Visocica Mountain to a mountain hut (one of those beautiful ones in Switzerland) where you could camp overnight if you wanted. The vista was nothing short of phenomenal. However, what really made the trip more interesting was hearing about the recent history from the perspective of our tour guide and about the sustainability projects Green Visions tries to push for the area. The owners of Green Visions were recently able to acquire a building near the edge of the Visocica Mountain I believe and they put down fiber optic cable for high speed internet and have room & board (with central heating) in order to hope to turn this place into a co-working place. The food in this building/mountain hut was honestly really good - probably better than some of the restaurants in Sarajevo. If we had known about this earlier we honestly might have stayed there for a few days instead of in Sarajevo. Going with this tour group is more than just a tour - also pushing for sustainable travel and you get to really see what the outdoor culture is like in Bosnia!\n\nReviewed By bobmarley804\n\nTour was amazing, tour guide Andro who is also an owner of the tour company was fantastic. It was raining really bad during our tour he took us to a cafe to wait for rain to pass a bit and after he tried to fit everything in for us to have best experience. He was on time and was flexible with time because our cruise was a little late on time originally schedule for a tour. He made sure we were happy and wanted my kids and I to go places we wanted and answered all the questions we had plus had such a great knowledge of the history of the region. Made my girls and I fall in love with Montenegro thanks to Andro. I highly recommend this tour you will be highly satisfied! If I could give it 10 stars I would!\n\nReviewed By PattyVA\n\nDue to the lack of tourists in Dubrovnik, I had the opportunity for a private wine tour with Mario in early September. As someone who works in the wine industry in the U.S., it was a true pleasure to spend the day with Mario receiving an incredible overview of the grapes grown and wines produced in the peljesac pennisula in Croatia. We began the day visting an oyster farm where we tasted oysters fresh from the sea on the boat paired with wine. Not a huge fan of oyster's, I'll try anything and I'll say they were quite tasty. We then had three different tasting with three vastly different wineries, providing a lovely overview of the wine history of the region. I then enjoyed a three course lunch at a beautiful restaurant by the sea before stopping in Ston, a sleepy historic town before we made our way back to Dubrovnik. Mario is an engaging host who knows his wine and the region very well. I'll definitely be in touch when I return to Croatia hopefully sooner than later! Thank you for a fantastic day! Highly recommend if you find yourself in Dubrovnik and want to explore the local wines!\n\nReviewed By arhunter87\n\nFunky Tours arranged several excellent tours while I was based in Bosnia (one or two which were free of charge) between October 2020 and March 2021. This included a food and drink tasting tour, the siege of Sarajevo tour, a day trip to Jajce and Travnik, a day trip to the Srebrenica genocide memorial centre, as well as one to Herzegovina which included stops in Mostar, Medugorje and Pocitelj. Each tour was outstanding and the tour guides, having lived through the events you learn about on the tours, are fascinating people to spend a day with (a big thanks in particular to Taib). I learned so much about Bosnia, past and present, from them. Booking the tours was always made easy and they even arranged a customised tour of the famous Sarajevo City Hall which included a visit to a replica ICTY courtroom (a big thanks in particular to Ema). I learned so much about Bosnia on each tour - from what it was like living through the war to finding out about the Bosnia of today. Even although some of the events they cover are difficult for a visitor to comprehend (partly because the country has been largely rebuilt), you come away from it realising how relevant Bosnia's history is to the world we live in today. I was lucky enough to see first hand so many of the great things about the country - its diverse landscapes and stunning views across several towns and cities (especially Sarajevo), how much the country has been rebuilt in the last 20 years (it would not be fair to class Bosnia as 'war torn' any longer), the wonderful mix of architecture and traditions, its excellent local cuisine and of course the down to earth and wonderfully hospitable Bosnian people who are always welcoming of visitors. Bosnians are rightfully keen to show that their country has so much more to it than the war that ended there more than 25 years ago. Having been on several tours I feel like I am just about an expert on all things Bosnia and Herzegovina. I absolutely recommend Funky Tours - in fact I cannot recommend them highly enough. Bosnia is a great country to explore and because of its offering which includes Olympic ski slopes near Sarajevo and vineyards in Herzegovina it can be considered as both a winter and summer destination. The main thing is to make sure you go there at some point - and use Funky Tours to show you around!
