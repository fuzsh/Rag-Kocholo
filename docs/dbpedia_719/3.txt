Ceste

This group lists the 7 main tags for the road network, from most to least functionally important for motor vehicle traffic.

highway motorway Za označavanje autocesta. Podrazumijeva cestu s ograničenim pristupom (nema bicikala, sporih vozila), s 2 ili više traka plus 1 zaustavnom trakom. Ekvivalentno američkom Freeway, njemačkom Autobahn, itd.. highway trunk Brzi put je javni put namijenjen za saobraćaj isključivo motornih vozila, s jednom ili dvije razdvojene

kolovozne trake, koji ima sve raskrsnice u dva ili više nivoa s poprečnim putevima i drugim saobraćajnicama (željezničkim ili tramvajskim prugama), prema pravilu nema zaustavnih traka. Za označavanje koristiti i key motorroad=yes.

highway primary Magistralne ceste u BIH. highway secondary Regionalne ceste u BIH. highway tertiary Lokalne ceste. highway unclassified Nerazvrstane ceste - nema administrativne klasifikacije. Unclassified ceste su obično najniži oblik mreže cesta. Obično uske ceste, da se ne mogu normalno mimoići 2 automobila.

Opaska: Ovo nije oznaka za ceste gdje se još treba utvrditi highway tag (pogledaj highway=road za ceste koje trebaju dobiti klasifikaciju). highway residential Ceste tj. ulice koje su unutar i oko naselja, nisu klasificirane niti nerazvrstane (unclassified).

Link roads

highway motorway_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a motorway from/to a motorway or lower class highway. Normally with the same motorway restrictions. highway trunk_link Spojne ceste (rampe ili izlazi) koji vode na i sa brze ceste ili na i sa druge brze ceste sa istim restrikcijama kao i brza cesta. highway primary_link Spojne ceste (rampe ili izlazi) koji vode na i sa magistralnu cestu ili na i sa druge magistralne ceste. highway secondary_link Spojne ceste (rampe ili izlazi) koji vode na i sa regionalne ceste ili na i sa druge regionalne ceste. highway tertiary_link The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a tertiary road from/to a tertiary road or lower class highway.

Special road types

highway living_street Ulica gdje pješaci imaju prednost nad automobilima, gjde se djeca igraju na ulici, maksimalna brzina je mala. U Bosni i Hercegovini ih zovemo »područje nižeg intenziteta prometa«, koje označuje mjesto u naselju na kojem se ulazi u područje u kojem se ne smije voziti brže od brzine hoda pješaka jer je dječja igra svugdje dopuštena. highway service Uopšteno cesta za pristup zgradama, servisnim stanicama, plažama, kampovima, industrijskim pogonima, poslovnim zonama, itd.. Takođe se koristi i za pristup parkingu i odvozu otpada.

koristi se sa service=*, npr. service=parking_aisle kako bi označili put unutar parkinga amenity=parking. highway pedestrian For roads used mainly/exclusively for pedestrians in shopping and some residential areas which may allow access by motorised vehicles only for very limited periods of the day. To create a 'square' or 'plaza' create a closed way and tag as pedestrian and also with area=yes. highway track Ceste za poljoprivredne svrhe (kameni put,makadam,kaldrme,lenije), šljunčane ceste u šumi, itd.; obično neasfaltirane ceste. Za više pogledaj Hr:Key:tracktype. highway bus_guideway A busway where the vehicle guided by the way (though not a railway) and is not suitable for other traffic. Please note: this is not a normal bus lane, use access=no, psv=yes instead! highway escape For runaway truck ramps, runaway truck lanes, emergency escape ramps, or truck arrester beds. It enables vehicles with braking failure to safely stop. highway raceway A course or track for (motor) racing highway road Cesta za koju ne znamo klasifikaciju. Ovaj tag bi trebalo izbjegavati. To je privremena oznaka za ceste dok se pravilno ne istraže. Kada su istražene, treba ažurirati pripadajuću klasifikaciju. highway busway A dedicated roadway for bus rapid transit systems

Staze

highway footway Pješačke staze koje su uglavnom/isključivo za pješake. Ovo uključuje šetnice i šljunčane staze. Ako je dozvoljeno biciklima, možete dodati oznaku bicycle=yes. Ne bi trebali koristiti za staze gdje se nezna primarna namjena. highway bridleway Za konje, pješake i bicikliste. Ekvivalentno oznakama highway=path + horse=designated. highway steps Za stepenice na pješačkim stazama. Koristite sa step_count=* kako bi označli broj stepenica. highway corridor For a hallway inside of a building. highway path Staza koja nije specifična i koristi se pješke, biciklom, konjem itd. highway via_ferrata A via ferrata is a route equipped with fixed cables, stemples, ladders, and bridges in order to increase ease and security for climbers.
