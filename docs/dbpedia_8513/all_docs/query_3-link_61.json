        "meta_description": "While the French Socialist government introduced same sex marriage in 2013, it was the Conservative Lib Dem coalition which implemented a similar measure at the same time in Britain. It was a breakthrough initiated by David Cameron, who took over a highly homophobic Conservative Party that had implemented section 28 in 1988 during the Thatcher years. Although Cameron benefited from cross-party support in the House of Commons, he had to face criticisms within his own party, which had not completely made a departure from the legacy of Thatcherism. This paper aims to explain how Cameron managed to fuse the idea of same sex marriage into the Conservative ideology by combining the notions of marriage, morality, family and individual liberty, and how the Lib Dems supported the radical measure, while carefully claiming their differences with their Conservative allies in the prospect of the next 2015 general election.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n7 Ibid., pp. 311-312.\n\nMore than any other single reform enacted by the Coalition, it symbolized Cameron’s politics and the continuity of his beliefs in marriage. (...) Cameron did not regard the issue as a frivolity or a sideshow. In fact, it encapsulated his social philosophy more precisely than any other measure or initiative.\n\n15 Margot James interview, 2011 cited in ibid., p. 303.\n\nCredit is due to David Cameron for the tremendous change that has taken place. I attended the Bournemouth conference where he made his first leadership speech, and he spoke of gay people and their relationships in equal terms. It was a very emotional moment for me. I never thought I would hear a Conservative leader say something like that in his main conference speech – and he said that to a totally unchanged party, because he had courage and conviction.\n\n4 Very few studies have so far analysed David Cameron’s motive to implement same-sex marriage, with the exception of Michael Mcmanus’s Tory Pride and Prejudice (2011), a short passage from In It Together (The Inside Story of the Coalition Government) by Matthew d’Ancona published in October 2013, or Same-Sex Marriage (The Road to Equality) released in 2013. This paper aims to explore Cameron’s personal journey in making the Conservative Party more gay-friendly and to explain why this new form of Conservatism fits in with the ideology of the Lib Dems (the Conservatives’ ally in the coalition). Cameron’s brand of Conservatism shows the capacity of his party to reinvent itself and to cope with the dichotomy of “tradition” and “change” in keeping with the electorate’s concerns. To carry out this analysis, Cameron’s evolving stance on gay matters should be accounted for as a long process starting before his election as the leader of the party in 2005. His personal journey regarding gay rights encapsulates all the tensions within his party to sustain both a moral tradition and individual liberty, which T. E. Utley rightly identified in the late 1960s :\n\n16 T. E. Utley, “What Laws May Cure – A New Examination of Morals and the Law”, 1968, cited in Charles (...)\n\nIn these matters, the historic Conservative party speaks with two distinct voices. The principles it proposes are complex and often apparently self-contradictory. There is, in the first place, the old voice of Tory paternalism which may be heard in the prayer-book petition that the Queen and her magistrates shall receive the divine Grace which they need in order to execute “to the punishment of wickedness and vice and the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue”. (...) On the other hand, there is equally strong authentic note struck by the liberal elements in the Conservative tradition represented, for instance, by Burke’s admonition to Government that it must tolerate frailties until they have festered into crime. (...) If freedom in the conduct of wage negotiations is sacred, how much more is freedom sacred in the conduct of love affairs ? What right have men to impose their own standards on each other ? (...) The truth is that there are very few sane and moderate men who honestly consider these things today without being painfully torn between these conflicting traditions.\n\n5David Cameron had to face opposition from a large faction of his party, but managed to reconcile the ideas of the tradition of marriage, while at the same time enhancing the liberty of gay couples to make the choice, as a right, to get married.\n\nGay rights and the Conservative Party as “the nasty party” in the Opposition years before Cameron’s leadership (1997-2005)\n\nFrom an ideological point of view : “The nuclear family” versus “The gay family”\n\nThe nuclear family is the first social institution where to form one’s identity. It establishes a link between generations, binding the individual within the web of past and future history. It is a source of natural values, stability, order and continuity. Thanks to the nature of family life, in their solemn innervations, people are conservative. (Scruton)\n\n19 cited in Bruce Pilbeam, ‘Social Morality’, op. cit., p. 171.\n\nIt is a key means by which the vigorous virtues are passed down from generation to generation. (Letwin)\n\n26 Ibid., p. 25.\n\nThatcherite homophobic discourse was deeply influenced by the homophobic media coverage of AIDS. (...) Section 28 supporters thought that the latter “had originated in the gay male space and had subsequently spread to the heterosexual space. (...) They spoke about the heterosexual nation as if it were a body whose immune system had to ward off the dangerous homosexual virus which threatened to invade the nation from the immoral side.\n\n30 Hansard, Parliamentary Debates, 25 January 1999, vol. 324, col. 48.\n\nThe House would do well to remember the views of one of its most principled members this century. Enoch Powell argued from first principles. Soon after the 1957 report on homosexual offences, he stood firmly —against many — for its implementation. Public opinion would not have been with him, but today a majority are in favour of what he stood for. He was convinced on principle. For him it was a matter of freedom, but it was also about leadership, which required bravery. This is a time for Parliament to do the right thing : to amend the law and demonstrate leadership.\n\nComposition of the Tory parliamentary group and Conservative opposition in the House of Lords before 2005\n\n12 In addition, this anti-gay stance was also manifest in the House of Lords. For example, Baroness Young firmly resisted any move from the government to promote gay rights and scrap Section 28 from 1999 to 2003. She was strongly supported by former Home Secretary David Waddington, whose comment in the House of Lords in December 1999 encapsulates all the homophobic feelings from the Tory Party :\n\n37 Hansard, Parliamentary Debates, 6 December 1999, col. 1061.\n\nIt is our job to see that it does not infringe the right of children to be brought up knowing what is right and what is wrong, understanding that sodomy is not the moral equivalent of sexual intercourse between a man and a wife, and appreciating the importance of marriage and of children being brought up by a man and a woman bound by their marriage vows to a lasting relationship.\n\n13 At that time, it would have thus been heretical in the Conservative Party to think of introducing same-sex marriage. The change of course taken by the Conservative Party coincided with David Cameron’s election as Leader of the party in 2005. Why did he gradually change his position towards gay people even before 2010 ? How did he manage to brand a new form of modern conservatism which would accommodate more tolerant ideas towards gay people ?\n\nCameron’s revamping of Conservatism towards a gradually more LGBT-friendly position (2005-2010)\n\nAnalysis of recent studies on Cameron’s shift to a more social agenda\n\n16 More generally, Cameron called for a brand of “Liberal Conservatism”, which would allow him to get the support of the Liberal Democrats on many issues but a few like Europe. He made a pivotal speech at Bath in March 2007 :\n\n44 David Cameron, “A Liberal Conservative Consensus to Restore Trust in Politics”, Speech in Bath, 22 (...)\n\nI am a Liberal Conservative. Liberal, because I believe in the freedom of individuals to pursue their own happiness, with the minimum of interference from government. Sceptical of the state, trusting people to make the most of their lives (...) this is Liberalism. And Conservative, because I believe that we’re all in – that there is a historical understanding between past, present and future generations (...) Conservatives believe in continuity and belonging ; we believe in the traditions of our country which are embedded in our institutions. Liberal and Conservative. Individual freedom and social responsibility.\n\nCameron’s strategy\n\n52 Tony Blair, A Journey, London, Hutchinson, 2010, pp. 581-582.\n\nThe Tories had also come to support the Civil Partnership Act, meaning that the issue would not be used again as a dividing line in British politics. This was an important gain for the health of our political debate (...) and it revealed something of the changing nature of politics. I felt progressive politics had to create a different set of paradigms about politics in order to achieve a greater and deeper spread of support. (...) My generation had defined a different paradigm : what you did in your personal life was your choice, but what you did to others was not. So a distinction came about between attitudes to human beings (non-discriminatory in race, gender or sexuality) and attitudes to social order (we need to impose it).\n\nThe Coalition’s implementation of same-sex marriage : Cameron’s vindication of a more “compassionate Conservatism” towards gay people.\n\nSame –sex marriage : a pledge from the coalition?\n\nConsultation to introduce the same-sex marriage bill\n\n63 David Cameron, “Leader's Speech”, Manchester 2011,\n\nBut for me, leadership on families also means speaking out on marriage. Marriage is not just a piece of paper. It pulls couples together through the ebb and flow of life. It gives children stability. And it says powerful things about what we should value. So yes, we will recognise marriage in the tax system. But we’re also doing something else. I once stood before a Conservative conference and said it shouldn't matter whether commitment was between a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, or a man and another man. You applauded me for that. Five years on, we're consulting on legalising gay marriage. And to anyone who has reservations, I say : Yes, it's about equality, but it's also about something else : commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I’m a Conservative.\n\nCameron believes in marriage\n\n68 “Cabinet Ministers Back Bill to Allow Same-Sex Marriage because They are Conservatives”, The Telegr (...)\n\nCivil partnerships for gay couples were a great step forward, but the question now is whether it is any longer acceptable to exclude people from marriage simply because they love someone of the same sex. Marriage has evolved over time. We believe that opening it up to same-sex couples will strengthen, not weaken, the institution. Attitudes towards gay people have changed. A substantial majority of the public now favour allowing same-sex couples to marry, and support has increased rapidly. This is the right thing to do at the right time.\n\n27 Cameron now felt buttressed by popular opinion on same-sex marriage to continue taking the nation towards more openness and greater equality of treatment, an electoral pledge but also his tenet since 2005 :\n\n70 Jessica Geen, “David Cameron Urges Tories to Back Gay Marriage”, PinkNews.co.uk, 5 October 2011,\n\nAnd to anyone who has reservations, I say this : Yes, it’s about equality, but it’s also about something else : commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.\n\n72 Scott Roberts, “David Cameron Explains what Equal Marriage Means to Him”, PinkNews.co.uk, 18 July 2 (...)\n\nI have backed this reform because I believe in commitment, responsibility and family. I don’t want to see people’s love divided by law. Making marriage available to everyone says so much about the society that we are and the society that we want to live in – one which respects individuals regardless of their sexuality. If a group is told again and again that they are less valuable, over time they may start to believe it. In addition to the personal damage that this can cause, it inhibits the potential of a nation. For this reason too, I am pleased that we have had the courage to change.\n\n29If individual liberties are hampered by the State, it is impossible for the citizens to take part in the good organic development of society, as it inhibits the potential of a nation. Cameron’s stance thus embodies the Conservative idea of the organic nation in which the State’s actions should guarantee individual liberties.\n\nThe Lib Dems’ support\n\n30 The Lib Dems wanted to pilot the reform. Nick Clegg reasserted in 2012 that it was a long-standing commitment of his party and linked “equality of treatment of gay people” to “Liberalism” :\n\n73 “Nick Clegg: First Gay Marriage before 2015, because of the Lib Dems in Government”, March 11, 2012 (...)\n\nWe are bringing forward proposals for gay marriage, already provoking debate. Let me just say, if you are a young gay person, your freedom to love who you choose is a fundamental right in a liberal society - and you will always have our support.\n\n76 Scott Roberts, “Nick Clegg: I Didn’t Think My Equal Marriage Pledge to PinkNews Could Become Law so (...)\n\nWell I think it is a really good thing that this has now finally escaped the strictures of one party somehow trying to get one over on the other party that actually there seems to be – not withstanding some very vociferous objections within the Conservative Party – [and] some deep splits within the Conservative Party – none the less [there is] plenty of people in all parties who want to see this change happen and think that is right that we make sure that people who love each other regardless of their gender, regardless of their sexuality can express that love through marriage.\n\nConclusion\n\n83 “Gay Marriage: MPs Back Bill despite Conservative Backbench Opposition”, op. cit..\n\nThis is a proud day and an important step forward in the fight for equality in Britain. The overwhelming majority of Labour MPs supported this change to make sure marriage reflects the value we place on long-term, loving relationships whoever you love. (...) Equal marriage builds on Labour's successes in government which include the repeal of Section 28, equalising the age of consent, the introduction of civil partnerships and changes to the rules governing adoption.\n\n35Nick Clegg pointed out that the reform had been a long-term commitment of the Lib Dems, who played a significant role in supporting the law. He did not want the Tories to take any advantage of this move. Cameron’s successful passing of the reform depended on cross-party support, which shows that many in the Conservative Party, as well as many Tory voters or activists, were far from ready to accept this move from the Prime Minister. Local Conservative branches had to reassure the Conservative constituents that Cameron was genuinely Conservative. In the short term, Cameron did not really benefit from such a tolerant social initiative. This would undoubtedly pave the way for further political debates on the ideas of “individual liberties”, “equality” and “state interference in the private sphere” between the three main parties in the run-up to the 2015 general election."
