        "text": "Someone needs to tell poor Lynne Featherstone that the world has changed. The equalities minister has just announced that she intends to hold a \"body confidence summit\" to tackle the problem, as she sees it, of undersized fashion models.\n\nMs Featherstone, a Liberal Democrat member of the Coalition who was this year voted Parliament's most attractive MP, is clearly still living in the New Labour era of pointless initiatives and, dare we say, window dressing. She also seems blithely unaware that the nanny state is on its last legs.\n\nI have a mental picture of her sitting in her office at the Equalities Department near Buckingham Palace with her fingers in her ears muttering \"not listening, not listening\" as all around her ministers slash and burn and rip up politically correct red tape. Indeed, it is testament to how much David Cameron has managed to change about Britain since May, that Ms Featherstone's proposal already looks so ridiculous.\n\nIn a few months we've been spoilt with a raft of initiatives sweeping away the interfering, opinionated state, and, guess what, we like it. \"Speed cameras to be axed\" was the latest dream headline at the weekend. So when the pouty Ms Featherstone declares war on skinny models and says she will call in magazine editors and fashion industry executives to address the effects of airbrushed images of physical perfection on impressionable youngsters, I find myself saying, \"Ah, bless!\"\n\nI almost enjoyed reading about her initiative in the way I might tuck into a bowl of bread-and-butter pudding every now and again. I don't actually like it that much (too fattening), but it has great nostalgic value.\n\nThe MP for Hornsey and Wood Green cited Christina Hendricks, the curvy star of Mad Men, the American television series, as a suitable role model for girls. How quaint is that? A minister of the Crown telling us whom we ought to look up to. And you thought these people went out with the Ark.\n\nI'm wondering whether Ms Featherstone isn't having a spot of bother with the issue herself. I'm not so sure she doesn't stare agonisingly at herself in the mirror in the mornings trying to ape inappropriate role models and saying, \"If I squint, I do look a bit like Harriet Harman.\"\n\nI'm enjoying the rise and rise of Crispin Blunt. The justice minister was, until recently, best known for calling on Iain Duncan Smith to resign as Tory leader in 2003, sparking the crisis that led to the Quiet Man's eventual defenestration. Now Mr Blunt appears to have a death wish of his own, defending parties in prisons one minute and calling for offenders to be let out of jail if they apologise the next. I would love to hear more of his wacky ideas, but I fear his 15 minutes of fame may soon be up.\n\n...After an experience on an easyJet flight to the south of France last week that can only be described as comical, I decided to play it safe for my impending trip to Italy and fly British Airways. But it seems BA has ways of tormenting its customers that make budget airlines look compassionate. Having booked my flight online, and at no point been asked to fill in passenger names, I immediately phoned the helpline. I was told that the lack of names on my booking could not possibly be a technical error. It was entirely my fault and would cost me Â£30 extra per name to rectify. I had two choices. Either I could pay the charges or I could be the proud owner of two seats on a plane to Naples which neither I nor my mother would be allowed to sit on. EasyJet, all is forgiven."
