        "text": "If you, like everyone else in the industry, are looking for some political clarity as we await the result of negotiations between the main political parties, Re:fresh, in London on Thursday is the place to be.\n\nOur opening speaker is leading political commentator and blogger Iain Dale, who has been prominent in various media over the last few weeks and has been blogging furiously since the election result became clear, with his views on the hung parliament and what it means to both politics and the country.\n\nOn Thursday, he will talk about his vies on the hung parliament and how he feels the country and the fresh produce industry will be affected by what, for many of us, will be an unprecedented political backdrop to our working lives.\n\nYesterday, he wrote: “I've just remembered something from a conversation I had with Nick Clegg once. I said to him that he had taken one or two risks as LibDem leader, which I couldn't have imagined any of his predecessors taking. He replied: ‘What's the point of playing safe. In politics, sometimes you have to take a risk. Especially if you are leader of a third party.’\n\n“The news channels are reporting that Clegg and Cameron had a one on one meeting tonight, lasting for over an hour at Admiralty House. It was described as ‘constructive and amicable’\n\n“The fact is that both party leaders are taking risks, which if things go wrong, will be very damaging to them personally. Good on them for having the courage to dare,” wrote Dale.\n\nAnother entry looked at the LibDem negotiating line. “If I were a LibDem negotiator, I'd probably be pushing for four seats around the Cabinet table on the basis of the seats they have in the Commons. There was some talk that the LibDems would argue that seats in the Cabinet should reflect the proportion of the actual national vote. On that basis the LibDems would say they wanted 8 seats. Fat chance. So let's work on the basis that they get 4 seats,” he wrote.\n\n“The next question is the position of Nick Clegg himself. When Paddy Ashdown was negotiating with Blair he made clear he didn't want a Cabinet position himself. Perhaps Clegg would take the same viewpoint. On the other hand, perhaps he would become Deputy Prime Minister without an actual department.\n\n“Assuming there are three other Cabinet positions available, who would take them, and would they be chosen by Nick Clegg on his own or in consultation with David Cameron?\n\n“There would no doubt be a public clamour for Vince Cable to be Chancellor, but I think it is safe to rule that out. There is just no way that he would be acceptable in that role to the Conservatives. Perhaps the same might be said of George Osborne to the LibDems, in which case I could just about foresee Ken Clarke being Chancellor with Vince Cable as Chief Secretary. They would rapidly become the Waldorf and Stadler of British politics, but they would be a very reassuring team to the British public in difficult economic times.\n\n“But I think that outcome is very unlikely to happen. A far more likely scenario is for David Laws to take on the Chief Secretary portfolio.\n\nOther LibDem candidates for office might be Paddy Ashdown for Northern Ireland and Chris Huhne, but when you scan the list of the 57 LibDem MPs, you have to come to the conclusion that there aren't many other candidates for Cabinet posts. Sarah Teather? Ming Campbell would no doubt love to get the Foreign Office but I can see no way that Cameron would jettison William Hague from that post. Ed Davey would no doubt expect to be considered but even his colleagues in the LibDems don't rate him.\n\n“Can anyone really imagine Simon Hughes in a Conservative dominated Cabinet? Not sure I can. Jo Swinson, Lynne Featherstone, Norman Lamb? All three are talented but I somehow can't see them in a Cabinet,” Dale opined.\n\nTo read Dale’s ruminations over the next few days, go to iandaleblogspot.com - to see him in person, register for the Re:fresh Conference.
