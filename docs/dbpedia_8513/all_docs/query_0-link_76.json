        "text": "It's been almost a year since the Government's first Girl Summit, which brought together survivors, ministers and organisations all committed to rallying a global movement to end FGM. But as the summer holidays approach, David Cameron has ordered a crackdown on the ‘cruel, barbaric practice’ with new measures to seize passports.\n\nThe Prime Minister has ordered ministers to rush through new laws which prevent young girls being taken abroad to undergo female genital mutilation, in the first wave of FGM 'protection orders'.\n\nAny individual suspected of trying to take someone abroad for FGM will be forced to surrender their passport or face five years in prison.\n\n'Female genital mutilation is a cruel and barbaric practice,' Cameron told the Observer. 'At last year’s global summit in London, I said we should not rest until this abhorrent practice is stopped everywhere. But the fact that it is happening right here, to young women and girls in our own country, sickens and appals me. These new orders will help in the fight against this horrific abuse.'\n\nFor years Female Genital Mutilation was considered a taboo subject amongst many politicians. Earlier this year Lynne Featherstone blogged for Red about how, despite the thousands of girls around the world suffering, no-one talked about it.\n\nSince then the Health and Social Care Information Centre has revealed that there have been 3,963 identified cases of FGM in the UK, with 60 involving girls under 18.\n\n'It is fantastic that the UK is continuing to ensure that FGM is urgently treated as a human rights violation,' Mary Wandia, FGM programme manager for Equality Now, said.\n\n'We hope that the UK can become a model for other countries in terms of ending FGM, but psychological, emotional and health support is still urgently needed for survivors.'"
