        "text": "Political\n\nCameron’s a Fraud, Featherstone’s a Hero!\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for students of De Montfort University, like myself, to be proud. Up until a couple of years ago, DMU was barely on the higher education map, until mass investment transformed the university in to being the most improved higher education centre in the UK two years running. However, while I am proud of how the university has improved and continues to progress, I cannot sit idly by whilst they give out unjust awards to credit-stealing politicians.\n\nLast week, DMU vice-chancellor Dominic Shellard travelled to Downing Street alongside several undergraduates to present Prime Minister David Cameron with the most prestigious award one can receive from the university. Why? He was the chosen recipient because of ‘his work’ towards introducing same-sex marriage. Now, the cynic in me thinks this award was actually given to Mr. Cameron for publicity and the excuse of same-sex marriage was just a guise to hide the real intentions of a university intent on promoting itself on a national scale. However, for the purpose of this argument we’ll assume they feel he earned it on merit.\n\nI am certain the VC and the university as a whole didn’t set out to offend anybody, but unfortunately they have. As a result of the ill-advised decision to award Mr. Cameron, DMU’s LGBT+ society has launched a campaign to have the award stripped and given elsewhere. In a statement released the day after David Cameron received the award, the society called for a clear rational for giving the Prime Minister the award and in turn discredited the decision.\n\nDavid Cameron is not the LGBT+ equality champion that deserves recognition. Many in and out of the LGBT+ society have called for Lynne Featherstone of the Liberal Democrats to instead obtain the award for the far larger role she and her party played in making same-sex marriage a reality. In turn, we in the LGBT+ society of DMU have criticised the University for the lack of correspondence with the society over their decision to reward Mr. Cameron on our community’s behalf. In fact, many think it’s obscene that DMU would choose to award a man who in the past voted against repealing Section 28, who has led a party that has supported economic and immigration measures that disadvantage LGBT+ youths and LGBT+ asylum seekers, and a man who has appointed Equalities ministers who voted against the very legislation for which he has just been rewarded.\n\nIf this wasn’t enough, it seems bizarre that the university would choose to honour a Conservative Prime Minister who has just slashed the maintenance grant for the poorest students, who raised tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000 during the last parliament, and whose austerity measures have decimated vital youth services up and down the country.\n\nThe university has already agreed to discuss the concerns of the LGBT+ society. However, it is important that we as students and LGBT+ people let De Montfort University know that is not okay to award a man for work he didn’t do, and in spite of the negative impact he has had on many LGBT+ people in this country. I think I can speak for most LGBT+ people in Britain when I say that we’re thankful for every Green, Labour, Plaid, SNP, Northern Irish and Tory MP that supported the Lib Dems’ same-sex marriage bill. However, if my university wants to reward people for bringing this policy about, they shouldn’t credit the Prime Minister who happened to be the incumbent at the time of the bill’s passing, and cast one vote like every other MP. Instead they should reward the Liberal Democrat who pushed this bill through parliament armed only with sheer guile, at a time when no politician was even talking about this issue. It’s crystal clear, De Montfort University; this award belongs to Lynne Featherstone.\n\nPuerile Patriotism and its Punitive Price\n\nI’m going to make a shock confession here, something that will make the older generation grimace, the Tories gasp, the Kippers rage and just about anyone else go misty-eyed with astonishment; I don’t consider myself a patriot.\n\nOf course, I love living in the UK, I think it’s a fabulous country and I’m well aware of just how fortunate I am to live here but I still have a problem with blind allegiances to states – mostly because they spread division rather than unity it presumably seeks to.\n\nA patriot is someone who is fiercely proud of their country, whilst it’s not as strong a sentiment here as it is in the US, where patriotic propaganda is an all pervading inevitability, there is still a hearty following in the UK. And really, why is that? There are those who would rather identify as English, Scottish or Welsh rather than British, those that are vehement that their ‘nation’ is better than the others and vicariously, their citizens too. In reality though, a nation is just a line on a map, these borders don’t actually exist in a physical capacity. They are man-made, forged, phony, fictional, and trivial. A person does not suddenly mutate as you cross the border from Chester in to Wrexham. Nations mean nothing – or at least, they’re not worth being haughty, patronising or antagonistic over.\n\nThere is then a demand of patriotism to assume that everyone collected under one umbrella of national identity shares an innate commonality; a shared history and a shared future – but we don’t. Just because our experiences of life may be closer to those in the same nation doesn’t mean we’re all the same or even remotely alike. In the UK alone, there are hundreds of different socio-economic demographics, am I to really assume that I share more commonality with Sharon, the fascist homophobe from Sunderland than I do Christophe, the French gay liberal just because both of our mothers happened to give birth in the same imagined outline? Am I to adopt the historic on-goings of the nation I was born in as my own? If I were to visit Buckingham Palace, would I become the King? No, I don’t think so.\n\nI know thus far this article looks like a very asinine gripe with much of the population’s ideals but bear with me, I do have a point. Now, the thing is with patriotism is it’s open to misuse, on one hand it can provide a sound basis for a durable, embracing sense of identity and at the other it can be a highly combustible fuel that sparks a raging fire of jingoism. To me, it makes more sense to actually be proud of your locality, be proud of the area you experience, one you can directly see your contribution to and one you can directly influence rather than a political territory you will experience very little of in your life. I experience my home town but I know nothing of Huddersfield for example, I can’t adopt a faux pride of a place I know nothing about – what if that community’s values are at odds with mine? I can’t shirk them that responsibility just because of the common land mass we share, to make it easier for the nation’s politicians to target us in one fell swoop.\n\nIn fact, that’s all patriotism really is, it’s a feel good political tool that gives the nation a camouflaged whiff of bias toward the incumbent government, that’s why there is always so much gusto about ‘British attitudes’, ‘British culture’ etc. Again, this still seems like a very flimsy article until we come to discuss what patriotism can lead to – and that is a misplaced entitlement, a belief that this country belongs to a certain type of person or should be governed or experienced a certain kind of way. This attitude doesn’t stoke unity but division for those not willing, or not able to commit to ‘British values’.\n\nIn fact, it’s arguable that my issue is not with patriotism itself but with nationalism. Whilst I don’t think patriotism should be considered a mandatory virtue, that would induce incandescent rage in Little Englanders should anyone deviate from it, nor do I think patriotism should be used as a bargaining piece for electoral success, it’s ugly sister nationalism is what breeds the real hostility. Nationalism in this country has arrived once more in many different forms. Politically, civic nationalists the SNP and regular nationalists UKIP are on the rise as they seek to preserve the autonomy of their imagined lands. Whilst the English Defence League and Britain First adopt a brutally negative approach that disenfranchises anyone who doesn’t physically replicate what is expected of a person born in ‘their’ illusory land, and as a result we leave a sub-section of Britain, young Muslims, very susceptible to powerful propaganda that too offers them a place in the Jihadi ideals of the ‘nation’ of Islamism. That’s what nationalism has caused in this country, evil, fascist, authoritarian brutality on two fronts, on opposing sides, intent on using violent means to purge the other from the land, that’s the cost of being boastful about the mythical expectations and entitlements of one’s ‘nation’.\n\nSimply put, that is the real issue of patriotism, it teaches difference, division and a tribal mentality all based on the simple accident of birth. Sure, go ahead and cheer on England at the next World Cup, go berserk when Team GB scoop gold, silver and bronze in Rio next year but don’t use patriotism as a disguise for something fouler. Perhaps it’s time we focused less on what human inventions divide us and realise that removed from our very own conceptualities that we all belong to one nation of commonality – humanity.\n\nWhitingism : My Political Ideology\n\nI’ve stolen this from Nathaniel Higgins’ Reddit (just a disclaimer)\n\nParty: Liberal Democrats\n\nPolitical Compass: Harm-principle Liberal\n\nViews on issues:\n\nThe EU: Soft Eurosceptic. I would like us to have centralised policy on issues when it makes sense. The environment, immigration, terrorism etc. are all issues that cannot be dealt with independently, thus a shared EU policy makes sense. However, I am increasingly resentful of the undemocratic and bureaucratic tendencies of the organisation and how far removed it feels from the people.\n\nThe Economy: Austerity measures are nasty but necessary to reduce the deficit we currently own. Of course, there needs to be some sort of restraint and vital services need to be kept. However, in times of economic hardship, I would prefer to advocate for higher taxation on the rich and as few cuts to public services as possible. There is no sense in suffocating spending on infrastructure, that can be as big a hindrance on the economy as a deficit. I don’t agree with George Osborne’s belief that the government should have to run a surplus at all times. The state isn’t there to make a profit on tax. Ideally, a lower-tax society would be my goal.\n\nSocialism, Communism, Capitalism: I’m a liberal, like it or not we live in a capitalist world and that can get ugly. Liberals tend to favour free market removed of all intervention but I think we have to shrug this ideologically pure approach and realise that real ‘free markets’ require some responsible intervention from the state, although, only when absolutely necessary.\n\nLGBT+: LGBT+ politics are something I’m extremely passionate about. As a gay man, I am fully behind any pro-LGBT+ equality measures whether they pertain to gay men or other areas of the community.\n\nImmigration: I am a committed opponent to the xenophobic trend that has swept Europe in the last few years. Immigration is good, for society and for the economy. Better yet, liberalism relies on freedom, including the freedom to move wherever you want to. I am not a big fan of heavily policed borders, they’re very much conceptual and people should be free to settle on which bit of land they choose.\n\nMinimum wage: I endorse the introduction of a living wage rather than a minimum wage, there is enough wealth in this nation to sate the living costs of every single person in it. Also, whilst we’re sort of on the topic, I am not anti-zero hours contracts, restrictions may be necessary but no outright ban is needed. A guaranteed basic income seems like a good way of eliminating poverty from society and I would love to see further research in to a Negative Income Tax system.\n\nReligion: I’m a skeptical agnostic, I’m not fond of religion but I will argue tooth and nail for everybody’s right to be religious and hold their own spirituality and personal faith. However, it is absolutely vital that although religions should be valued in a cultural sense that they are not unduly rewarded with tax breaks, theocratic legislation and peerages.\n\nDrug Prohibition: In fifty years, people will look back in amazement that people are imprisoned now for taking drugs. It is high time we viewed drug addiction as a health issue and not a criminal one. Those with drug addictions should be sent to rehabilitation not prison. I would also like to see the mass decriminalisation of drugs with the view to legalisation of all drugs. The state should never have autonomy over someone else’s body.\n\nLocal democracy: In favour of devolution to the lowest most effective level. Communities need the power to change what affects them – it makes no sense to hoard power in centralised bodies just for the sake of it.\n\nOnline censorship: Nothing should be censored.\n\nTelevision censorship: Censorship is wrong, just include warnings if it could offend.\n\nNet Neutrality: Absolutely crucial to persist with it.\n\nFree Speech: Freedom of speech is obviously a liberal concept and I support it but I find it’s one of the areas when liberalism gets a bit sticky. Where do we decide what freedom is more important; the freedom to exert opinions freely or the freedom to not be attacked and provoked? I believe in freedom of speech up to the point of stoking or inciting violence or other hostile acts. It is important that we use free speech as a counteraction to bigotry when we can. Whilst we’re here, I will say that all opinions are open to criticism and disrespect.\n\nIslamisation of the UK: Right-wing propaganda that is stoking Islamist extremism and British nationalist extremism. Must be effectively and publicly discredited as the myth it is.\n\nLords Reform: A tricky one, hereditary peers must be scrapped immediately and viewed as an archaic assault on democracy. I’m in favour of an elected Lords, using proportional representation. It seems suitable given our nation’s hatred of elections that indirectly elected Lords based on the popular vote of the General Election could work. However, this may lessen the demand for electoral reform to the House of Commons.\n\nThe Monarchy: Democratically no such monarchy should exist and I think I am becoming increasingly anti-monarchy as the days pass. However, as long as the royals have no legislative power, serve only as ambassadors and continue to make a net contribution to the economy, I see no reason to rush to abdicate them.\n\nScottish independence: It’s something I oppose but also something I wouldn’t deny Scotland if they had voted for it. I am all for self-determination if it is their own will. It really isn’t for me to decide.\n\nAnimal rights/welfare: Animal rights are underplayed, we have no divine right over other lifeforms and they should be treated kindly and humanely at all times. I would like to see an animal policy approach based around the work of Temple Grandin.\n\nVoting age: Wholly in favour of the voting age being reduced to 16 for all elections. As parliament sits for five years, it is absurd we tell a 17 year old they can’t vote when a lot of that parliament’s actions will affect how they can lead their life.\n\nPrison/Crime: It is absolutely crucial that prison is made about rehabilitation and not about ideological punishment. That being said, it’s important from a psychological respect to know that some people are medically unable to be rehabilitated and they must be specifically managed by mental health experts. The death penalty is flawed in every aspect and has no place in any justice system. We have too many people in prison and could do with less confinement and more community service.\n\nTuition fees: Another tough one, education should be free but the tuition fees system in the UK has led to some of the best universities in the world, I support the repayment plan introduced by the Coalition government but would like to see a decrease in tuition fees to no more than £6,000 and lower where possible. I could yet be convinced that scrapping tuition fees altogether is the way to go, I’ve not yet decided. However, what I’m certain about is that tuition fees should cover all academic costs of any student including books and printing.\n\nEuthanasia: Is a long-time coming in this country. Of course the law needs to be enacted with thorough boundaries but a person should be able to have their life ended if they choose to do so, providing they’re of sound mind.\n\nTrident: Scrap it. Nuclear weapons cost the bursary an obscene amount of money, and we are never going to use them. We must campaign vigorously for multilateral disarmament but I fear that we’ll be waiting forever and somebody must take the lead.\n\nMilitary spending vs. Foreign Aid spending: Again, in an ideal world I would drastically reduce military spending and redirect it elsewhere. However, given the rising threats of IS and Putin’s Russia, it’s a good idea to maintain the same spending on military. Again, I’d like to increase Foreign Aid spending as high as 1% but 0.7% is more than enough now, however we should spend it more efficiently on nations who need it most and provide their citizens with proper human rights.\n\nCorporation tax: Progressive but low tax rate where larger companies pay a slightly higher rate than smaller companies. Eliminate deductions and loopholes.\n\nInheritance tax: Ideally, I would seek to scrap the inheritance tax, or at least reform it so the wealth of the recipient is taxed and not of the deceased. However, again this is the wrong time, the government needs money and those with the broadest shoulders should brunt the most of the shortfall.\n\nNHS: I think we should be careful not to be complacent over rhetoric of it being the world’s best health service, as I believe there are others that are better. The state should provide free healthcare to its citizens but we shouldn’t apply an over-zealous attachment to socialist institutions and disregard private health firms where they can improve standards and cut costs. I would prefer if we had government-paid-for health insurance.\n\nSex work: Decriminalise and unionise.\n\nThe BBC: I’m against the current system and would prefer funding for the BBC was grouped in with general taxation. However, I’m still not sold on the idea of a state-funded broadcaster, in just a year studying them at university, I remain entirely unconvinced by its effectiveness.\n\nElectoral reform: Additional Members System as implemented in Holyrood and the Welsh Assembly would not force a person to vote tactically against their own preferred party and would allow them at least one vote that counts without them losing a locally responsible MP. I also think it’s essential a £10,000 per person donation cap is enforced so the Tories don’t spread their message at the expense of their obscenely wealthy supporters\n\nIssues I’m passionate about: LGBT+ rights, social justice, feminism, democracy, drug law\n\nWhy you think what you do: I’ve always had an extremely strong sense of what is right and what is wrong.\n\nFuture of UK politics: An uninspiring blend of right-wing populism, nationalism and authoritarianism unless we can inspire people to listen to our preferable liberal vision.\n\nHow have my views changed: I’ve been a Liberal for as long as I remember, I’m a very committed chap.\n\nFavourite Politician: Paddy Ashdown, Lynne Featherstone, Nick Clegg, Norman Lamb, Maajid Nawaz, Tessa Munt, Liz Kendall, Anna Soubry, Ruth Davidson\n\nLeast Favourite Politician: Nigel Farage\n\nFavourite commentator: n/a\n\nPolitical tests\n\nPolitical Compass:\n\nAge: 21\n\nGender: Male\n\nWhere you live: Leicester\n\nOccupation: Student, Activist, Blogger, insufferable know-it-all\n\nStand Aside, Let the Refugees In!\n\nIt’s a disgrace! Thousands and thousands of migrants are trying to get in to our country illegally, and Mr. Cameron and the British government are doing absolutely nothing about it. Thousands of them, climbing aboard Lorries and whatnot, just so they can come and make our county their refuge – the situation’s absolutely appalling. If you’re reading this, bobbing your head a long thinking that these migrants have no right to swarm in to our nation and there should be a stern, brutal response to halt them, then shake your head some more – you’re the disgraces I’m talking about.\n\nIt’s far too easy for Britons to sit on a plinth of privilege and cast a casual eye of disdain at those trying to force entry in to the country. It’s easy for us to assume they are all benefit tourists, if such a thing even exists, and disregard what are clearly very desperate people willing to do very dangerous things to change their lives, as nothing more but unwelcome economic lepers.\n\nBut, the thing is, the migrants in Calais are not a gigantic welfare absorbing conspiracy intent on snatching jobs, damaging infrastructure and compelling Nigel Farage to feel awkward on his train commutes. These people, like I have said, are completely bereft of hope. Let’s apply some logic here, do you really think people would try and cling to the underside of HGVs for twenty-six miles just so they can claim a modicum of welfare from the British taxpayer? No, of course not.\n\nThe fact this foul pandemic of anti-immigrationism has now led to a point where many are completely stripping any human attachment to these migrants is distressing and harks back to an era we cannot return to. Even glancing through social media, I have seen the disgusting responses from users when reports of migrants trying to come to Britain are tweeted. Nearly all suggest “flooding the tunnel”, “shooting them” among other things. In fact, when one migrant died last week, there were even brazen boasts of having “one less to worry about.”\n\nThese are desperate people, how have we again reached a height of xenophobia, where people are happy to laud over those trying to escape unimaginable barbarism and squalor purely on the basis of the accident of their own birth in a place where no such scenario is worth contemplating? We are the privileged and we need to remember that. People talk a lot about ‘British values’, a virtually vacuous term aimed to install a bit of pride in the nation’s people. One value often assimilated with this fixed ‘Britishness’ is compassion, but we are so deficient of it for these poor people based on the work of Rupert Murdoch, The Daily Mail and UKIP’s purple mist of hate.\n\nThis crisis need not be a crisis if we actually practiced what we arrogantly attest to be our nature, and let the migrants fleeing genuine tyranny in. Why has David Cameron and his Conservative government deferred any sort of decision on this gargantuan issue so his party can launch fronts of genocide against badgers, foxes and bees instead? What are a few extra pounds spent on helping those in genuine need? What’s cutting out one caramel latte a week, what difference is that compared to the difference a safe haven would make for those fleeing the wickedest of regimes? These are not just statistics for The Daily Express to manipulate for electoral gain – we are talking about real human lives, and real human suffering. We need to sign up to the EU migrant quota and take in our fair share of refugees, we cannot stand idly by while this humanitarian emergency occurs.\n\nOf course, there are practical concerns whenever migrants come in to an already densely populated nation but let’s not misplace our aggravation here. Admittedly, 60,000 migrants will put a tiny strain on the nation, but we need to look at the bigger picture and realise that saving the lives of those brave enough to attempt an escape is worth slightly loosening the purse strings. If you don’t understand that this is not about a swarm of opportunistic vultures sponging off the electorate, and you cannot fathom why people are appalled at the sight of thousands disregarding the tragic deaths of those in the channel tunnel as a victory for the convenience of this privileged nation, then you at least need to understand that that’s because you are lucky, if you were on the other side of that tunnel, you would have a different view entirely.\n\nFind Your Backbone, Labour\n\nLabour are up a creek without a paddle, following yet another General Election defeat. As the party faces internal turmoil, they host a fascinating leadership debate that will see the party go one of two ways. Yes, two, not four.\n\nThere are so many reasons why Labour have become increasingly unpalatable to much of the electorate, and in fact, did they not possess the secure Northern, working class, and young anti-Tory vote, they would probably be in much worse shape than they already are. But, ironically, this is still one of the biggest problems, are Labour actually the anti-Tories?\n\nLabour have been steadily lurching right on economic issues, offering only a milder form of Tory austerity and have too become increasingly authoritarian on social issues. That’s the real issue with this Labour party, and it’s one that’s been brewing for years – they’re not principled, they just follow the scent of popular opinion wherever it lands, like a drooling dog chasing a line of sausages. It’s conceivable, had Labour not benefited from a hard to budge position as one of the nation’s two largest parties and archaic typecasting resulting in misplaced allegiance to their party, they may have been done for a long while ago.\n\nAnd, I think people are starting to see this; the Liberal Democrats argue their case from a point of liberalism, the Tories, whilst total bastards they may be, consistently argue a conservative ideology but what of Labour? The Labour movement of the late 19th and early 20th century is in far less demand now, to the point of it being nearly irrelevant. Labour are purportedly social democrats or democratic socialists but they have done very little to convey any such ideology in recent years, perhaps best illustrated by their refusal to oppose savage cuts to the welfare state that they so boastfully claim they invented.\n\nIs it any wonder people are disillusioned with Labour? Nobody knows which way they’re going to go next. In fact, a lot of the talk in the build up to this election hasn’t been about what good they can do for the country if they win another election, it has instead been about this ideologically impassioned need to hold the power. But, if Labour can’t even form their own sound ideology and principle base what can they expect to do in government? If they refuse to oppose brutal Tory cuts and want to borrow old Lib Dem catchphrases then why not just support either one of those current parties? Labour has become a corrupt machine obsessed with winning – not with doing.\n\nIt almost feels as if populism is Labour’s only plan, that’s what three quarters of the leadership candidates are offering anyway, much in line with the rhetoric Milliband used in the run up to this year’s general election. Let’s be clear here, anti-immigration mugs are in no way the mandate of a socially democratic party. Nor was the promise to slash tuition fees to £6,000 anything other than a deceptive economic policy concocted to take another stab at the former coalition of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, and win superficial support from warm words.\n\nLabour will go to the ballot boxes soon, and they will have two choices, a repetition of the career-driven, lacklustre, centrist, populist, wet lettuce politics that strives only for power and not righteous change for the good of the electorate, or a man in line with the principles of what Labour was founded to represent. Now, I’m not a ‘leftie’ nor would I ever vote for Jeremy Corbyn in a general election, but that doesn’t mean his party shouldn’t. He is the only candidate able to give Labour an actual foundation of beliefs, otherwise this cycle of false politics will go on and on and on.\n\nI won’t lie, I would be happy to see the Labour party crumble, I would. This isn’t to do with the voters or the members, the party is full of good people, but the people who are in charge have denied Britain any genuine social democratic option for decades now. The way I see it as an outsider is Labour have three choices; a) they dismantle and form a new party and hope they get it right this time, b) they dismantle and flock to the Lib Dems and the Greens as parties of ideological conviction and consistency or c) they find a backbone and promote their initial ideas and win from that position, they try, like all the other parties do, to promote what they believe and make the people believe it too.\n\nWhat they cannot do, is carry on down this bleak road where they tell the people what they think they want to hear, try desperately above all else to win power, and then sit on their hands because they have absolutely no idea what they believe in.\n\nFreedom To Donate\n\nToday marks the official launch of a campaign I have helped somewhat to build, and one with a cause I’m extremely passionate about. That campaign is Freedom To Donate. The campaign demands a review in to the archaic, discriminatory and nonsensical prohibitions on MSM (men who have sex with men) from donating blood simply due to their sexual activity and not on an individual risk assessment. This out-of-touch ruling is destroying lives – and together we can progress equality and prevent so many unnecessary deaths.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to help lobby MPs to support this campaign and an upcoming bill to be debated in parliament. Whilst this has been a harmonious, successful, cross-party movement (yes, even some of the Tories), I am especially thankful to the Lib Dem MPs for all of their support. I have had meaningful conversations with them all and have only seen passionate and positive responses in return. I would especially like to thank leader Tim Farron for being an unwavering voice of justice and righteousness for the campaign and, along with Caroline Lucas of the Greens, placing it at the forefront of their parties’ agendas.\n\nHowever, politicians aren’t the only ones who can help make this a reality. You can get involved and help save thousands and thousands of lives, and spare thousands and thousands unfair guilt and shame;\n\nFollow Freedom To Donate on Twitter; https://twitter.com/freedomtodonate\n\nWatch the campaign video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA8LPZIcQBU&feature=youtu.be\n\nJoin the thousands who have already signed the petition; https://www.change.org/p/uk-uk-government-apply-the-same-regulations-to-all-those-donating-blood-regardless-of-sexuality#petition-letter\n\nLearn more about why this ban should be lifted; http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/chris-whiting/blood-donation_b_7556458.html\n\nThe Future’s Bright. The Future’s Orange.\n\nMy party wrapped up its leadership election today appointing Tim Farron as the party’s new leader. Our ‘irrelevant’ selves clearly don’t know when we’re beaten, now reduced to a handful of MPs and a just pinch of the popular vote, the Liberal Democrats are a political species under threat, but there are plenty of reasons to believe Tim Farron possesses the antidote that will save British liberalism.\n\nTim Farron is probably unknown to most outside of the Liberal Democrat bubble, and in perhaps the least surprising yet comically ingenious trend of the year, his election today has been passively and mockingly met with forced apathy and feigned obliviousness from rival members of Labour and the Tories. But I strongly suspect they won’t be able to fake this for much longer.\n\nThe new leader of the Liberal Democrats is a dose of revitalisation, having opposed some of the most unpopular of compromises by the Lib Dems in government such as the Bedroom Tax and the tuition fee increase. Farron’s ability to mobilise voters in to campaigning is his greatest asset. It’s no secret we’ve been battered by the electorate since 2011 like the Tories have battered the young and the poor in their recent Summer budget. We accrued just 8% of the vote in May’s election, do you know in which constituency we had our only majority? Westmorland & Lonsdale, the seat Tim Farron transformed from Tory blue to Liberal gold, it was also the only constituency in 2014 where the Liberal Democrats were the highest polling party for the European parliament elections, another vote in which we were nationally humbled.\n\nThe electoral defiance of Farron and his team injects new hope in to the party that Liberalism in Britain can make yet another unthinkable comeback. I have to say, with apologies to our new leader, that I wasn’t always his greatest fan. It wasn’t that I didn’t agree with him on key issues or his vision for the country but I found him easy to ignore, then I watched his speech at the Liberal Democrat Autumn Conference last year and it invigorated the Liberal in me even more than Cleggmania did in 2010. Tim prides himself on his ‘get you in the gut’ politics and that’s exactly what he does. I, for one, was planning to waste tonight away eating chocolate biscuits and drinking coffee but instead I was inspired by his speech at Thursday’s Lib Dem leadership rally to spread the word of his new electrifying cause.\n\nIn fact, as I write this, the speech is barely an hour old, was only streamed on the Lib Dem website and on Sky News’ rolling feed yet it has still had the influence to get dozens of people tweeting of their intention to sign up and join this momentous fightback. I would encourage every person I know to watch Tim Farron in action, this is a very liberal nation, our liberal ideas are far greater than the opinion polls would suggest and the mission is to make liberals up and down the British isles assimilate their political morality with our party and get old Libby back in full flight – Tim is the man to achieve this.\n\nNo one is suggesting, myself included, that a Liberal Democrat recovery is easy nor even inevitable. In fact, it will be anything but extremely bloody difficult but there is still a great cause for hope; a sympathetic electorate satisfied with our punishment for colluding with our arch-rivals are now seeing what a blessing we were to government in the last five years, there are disillusioned progressives in the Labour party unsure whether they can continue to support a party intent on attaining power through any means of populism possible, there are around 20,000 new party members since May when we suffered the biggest setbacks in our history, and there is a rich heritage of liberalism convalescing against the odds on these shores. Our weakness will not be the content of our message but the volume of it, if people listen to us, we will win again – I am confident of that. We finally have an orating magician in British politics that stands for decency, progressivism and liberty, an anti-Farage, a man that can sweep up the ever escalating swathes of disillusioned voters and give them not unsolicited fear but hope of a fairer, stronger, liberal society with the Liberal Democrats as the beating orange heart of it.\n\nThe Fight For Equality is Far From Over\n\nAnd breathe… put those rainbow flags down, roll up those pro-equality banners and get back to your everyday lives, because the quest for LGBT+ equality is done now…right?\n\nIt was heartening to see my Facebook and Twitter feeds full to the brim with rainbow adorned profile pictures last week in the wake of the Supreme Court of the United State’s ruling that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional. This follows a same-sex marriage legalisation in Ireland a few weeks ago, both of which seemed oddly more celebrated than when the Lib Dems delivered the same ruling for Britain but the point remains, these heart-warming victories for marriage equality don’t end the procession of LGBT+ rights and they certainly shouldn’t serve as a reason for the Tory government to rest on its laurels.\n\nThere is still so much to do before parity between cisgender heterosexuals and the rest of society will be a reality. Whilst marriage equality has long been the centrefold issue of LGBT+ activism, we must now turn our focus to other areas. For instance, the MSM (men who have sex with men) blood donation ban, which stops those who have had intercourse with another man within the last year from donating blood even if its perfectly healthy – a review of this could not only legislate for greater equality but save thousands and thousands of lives. Whilst we’re at it, let’s actually achieve marriage equality, let’s push same-sex marriage in to Northern Ireland and end the abhorrent spousal veto which requires a spouse’s permission for a person to legally change their gender. We need to put external pressure on nations in the EU and the Commonwealth to raise their game when it comes to LGBT+ rights.\n\nWe need to protect mental health services from ideological Tory cuts to help one third of LGBT+ youths that will suffer from anxiety or depression. We need to take a proactive approach to drastically reducing the disproportionate homelessness among LGBT+ youth, which is eight times higher than for young straight people. On top of this, despite protestations from the right that it’s inappropriate, we need to provide age appropriate sex and relationship education in schools for not only gay, lesbian and bisexual students but for asexual students too. During my years at school the concept of any of these types of relationships was never discussed in the classroom, it was treated like an invisible taboo which could cause so much mental damage to a young person.\n\nFor too long we have been complacent on biphobia, we need to tackle the myth that a person cannot be attracted to people from more than one gender. As well as this, we must stand up for the rights of transgender people too and drag them up to parity with LGB equality. There needs to be a review on how transphobic hate crimes is documented to ensure those callous offences aren’t going undetected, as well as this redrafts of legal documents like passports must be made to include an ‘x-gender’ option to those who fell they’re neither male nor female.\n\nThe whole point of this endless ramble of LGBT+ issues is that there’s still a lot of work to be done. Truthfully, I have barely scratched the surface on the social and legislative inequalities still faced by LGBT+ people in Britain and abroad. Unfortunately, whilst there was good work done by the Liberal Democrats over the last five years, we are now left with a Conservative government. A party who voted en masse in opposition to same-sex marriage. As we saw with UKIP and their embarrassingly disrespectful parade invasion at London Pride, the right only ever want to be seen to help LGBT+ people – they never actually do it. That is why it is more crucial than ever for a progressive alliance to topple this Tory government and ensure we don’t lose ground on the race for equality.\n\nLabour are too busy fashioning false cocksure banners and the SNP are still flogging a dead-horse with the defeated one issue they care about. Instead, the rest of Britain’s progressives must align and challenge the Tories when they profess to be LGBT+ rights champions – they’re not. Nicky Morgan may be the Equalities Minister, but she famously voted against same-sex marriage too. The prevailing point of this article is that LGBT+ issues are as important now as ever, maybe even more so, a marriage certificate is a great step forwards but it’s still not enough – we’ve managed to get our foot in the door, let’s work together and push that door wide open.\n\nAmerica Is Plagued With Social Illness\n\nThe United States of America commands the attention of the globe, the world’s largest superpower and a behemoth for embedded national pride. The US calls itself the ‘beautiful’ and the ‘land of the free and home of the brave’, but whilst the United States has been busy monitoring other nation’s on-goings it’s forgotten to keep its own house in order.\n\nThe latest shooting in Charleston, North Carolina highlighted two major issues plaguing the United States; gun violence and racism. Starting with gun violence, citizens of the US are protected by the second amendment to possess firearms, it’s considered their second most important right. While the founding fathers were open to renegotiating the constitution as society progressed, many Americans want to keep the original document intact at the great cost of human safety.\n\nAll statistics show that gun control results in fewer violent gun crimes, the United States homicide rate is thirty times higher than other developed countries where there is significant control. Every year, around 10,000 Americans are killed by gunfire but yet the right to have a firearm is more important. In recent years, we’ve seen instances of people easily slaughtered by one mad man with a gun, sometimes even children, and the response is always the same; a spike in gun sales and tacit rhetoric from politicians. There have been over 150 school shootings in the United States since Dunblane led to the UK outlawing handguns in the late 1990s, in the same time there have only been two spree shootings in Britain of any kind.\n\nThe issue of racism is also depressingly prevalent across the pond. Anybody, purporting that this latest shooting had nothing to do with race is kidding themselves, black people in the United States are getting a disgustingly rough deal. If recent occurrences in Charleston and Ferguson don’t perfectly illustrate the extent of the issue then perhaps these frightening facts will;\n\nBlack Americans only possess 2.8% of the nation’s wealth, despite making up 13% of the nation’s population.\n\nThe recession hit black Americans three times harder than white Americans.\n\nSchools of 90% non-white students are $700+ underfunded per pupil.\n\nWhite Americans use more drugs than black Americans but black people are arrested for drug possession three times as much.\n\nBlack men receive 19.5% longer prison sentences for similar crimes committed by white men.\n\nEmployers are 30% less likely to call a candidate back for an interview if their name sounds ‘African-American’.\n\n73% of white people are homeowners, compared to 44% of black people.\n\nThe gap between median income for white and black people has tripled in the US in the last 25 years.\n\nBlack people are shot and killed by police officers, almost twice as often as any other ethnic group.\n\n88% of black people believe there is anti-black discrimination in the US, 57% of white people agree.\n\nThis sort of social and institutional racism is disgusting. And unfortunately combined with the US’s ridiculous gun legislation, it contributed to the recent events in Charleston.\n\nIt might seem odd that a developed nation, the ‘land of the free’ and the ‘home of the brave’ could ever possess this sort of social illness in 2015 but it all comes back to attitude. The United States thrives off of patriotism and theism, these two doctrines are reinforced at every single step of the way and can lead to some very socially right thinking. The latter is not really an issue in the development of heinous gun laws and societal racism but the extreme patriotism of the United States’ citizens has been hindering them for years.\n\nStar-spangled banners fly from every other building in the US, phrases like ‘God bless America’ are national slogans and all of this has led to an arrogant complacency. A widespread belief that the US has got its house in order and its role is to now monitor and fight the issues faced by nations elsewhere in the world. Founded from a genocide of the continent’s indigenous people, the nation founded an historic right to bear arms, which has never been contested because of the fabled status afforded to the founding fathers. Subsequently this law is protected by a widespread sense of national pride and the fear that any move against their inaugural legislation would be considered a form of treason.\n\nThis deep-running national arrogance has led to a slip away from the monumental Civil Rights movement and allowed the march towards equal rights for ethnic minorities to stall and actually regress. The United States may be a world superpower, it may be an economic powerhouse but it’s duty is not to be the world’s police or the globe’s surveillance but to protect its people from unrestrained gun violence spawning from archaic laws and institutional and societal racism that robs 13% of US citizens of the ‘American dream’ we hear so much about it. Nationalist rhetoric is all well and good but the US government needs to put its nation back at the heart of its decision-making. It says a lot that these problems are getting bigger and bigger even in the seventh year of the presidency of America’s first non-white leader.\n\nMSM Don’t Kill People, Stigma Does\n\nRecent reports have revealed that intake of new blood donors in Britain is down by a massive 40%. While news outlets speculate that a year’s deferral for people with new tattoos and piercings is to blame, I’d contest that a bigger reason for the shortfall is the yearly ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men (MSM). There are two reasons why this archaic law is so detrimental; firstly, it can cost people their lives. By snubbing donations by MSM, we are simply sanctioning people to death. Just one single donation can be administered to as many as three people; a quarter of people will need a blood transfusion in their life time, making the demand for blood transfusions around 16 million in the UK alone. However, confronted with that demand, our government still thinks it’s sound policy to rule out an estimated five and a half million donors solely based on their non-heterosexual activity. The rather vapid rationalisation for not taking blood from MSM is that there is a higher risk of them carrying HIV or the Hepatitis B virus, as a matter of fact, the NHS revealed in 2012 that 4.7% of MSM’s are HIV-positive, but does that statistic really matter? There is surely no issue in accepting blood from MSM if they don’t carry HIV or any other harmful virus, meaning a blanket ban is unfair and damaging to all parties. So why is it that we deny up to five and a half million people the right to donate blood and save lives on the 1 in 20 chance that their blood might carry HIV or Hepatitis B virus, especially when it is actively tested for before donation anyway?\n\nThat same NHS report also revealed that 3.7% of British people of Black African descent carried HIV. There would rightly be uproar if there was a blood donation ban on Black Africans on the 1 in 25 chance they too carry HIV or Hepatitis B. It’s stereotyping and it’s immoral. Another recent report on the continent shows that heterosexual women and lesbian women were experiencing the greatest rise in HIV contraction but yet again there is no imposition on either of those demographics. The truth of the matter is that this law is not in place to protect the health of those requiring a blood transfusion, but is in place on the back of an uncorrected stigma from thirty years ago. While it is fact that HIV is harmful, that Hepatitis B is incurable, and both are more likely to be carried by MSM, statistics show that more than 95% of MSM do not carry either virus and could help recover the shortfall in blood donations. This law proves, despite the right’s best protestations that the crusade for LGBT+ equality didn’t end last year when the Tories begrudgingly allowed the Lib Dems to pass marriage equality. It’s not only that this law is an unnecessary hindrance to saving lives; it’s also an infringement on the rights of LGBT+ people to give blood. In fact, perhaps the most confusing part of this legislation is its apparent assumption that men who sleep with women never have sex casually and if they do, always do so safely – yet there are more heterosexuals with HIV in the UK than there are non-heterosexuals. The law correctly reflects that MSM are higher risk than most demographics but also incorrectly assumes that those who partake in heterosexual activity are no risk – so surely it should either be deferral for all or open donations for all?\n\nThe pressure needs to be dialled up until we reach a cross-party consensus to lift this ban and start to champion equality and more importantly save lives. The Labour party have finally joined the Liberal Democrats and the Greens in support of scrapping this law and the Tories’ heads are slowly being turned too. Those passionate about equality and health need to start pushing this issue higher in the political agenda, making it clear that lives count for more than stereotypes. We all want an NHS that puts our health at the heart of its decision making but we’re currently abiding by legislation where, for example, a 7-year-old girl would be refused a life-saving blood donation from her uncle because he had sex with his male partner of twenty years a few weeks ago and despite knowing his negative status. Does that seem right to you? It’s fairly clear that the one year deferral on blood donations for MSM is nonsensical; it is rupturing equality and literally killing more people than this law was enforced to protect. This ruling is largely based on an out-of-date stigma that has never been legislatively amended, we cannot, especially in a time of falling rates of blood donation and an under pressure health service, continue to champion this eugenic discrimination – stigma is never a reason to gamble with people’s lives. Apparently, to put a twist on an old adage, blood is thicker than water but it’s not thicker than homophobia. Join the fight against the MSM blood ban.
