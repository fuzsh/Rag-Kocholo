        "text": "The leader of the Labour party was the biggest casualty on a night of major shocks. Ed Miliband stepped down after a clear Conservative victory, David Cameronâs party winning 331 seats to Labourâs 232.\n\nMr Miliband still holds his seat in Doncaster North, which he won with 52 per cent of the vote, up from the 47 per cent he achieved in 2010, but his party was left stunned by the election result.\n\nDevastated in Scotland, Labour failed to win the key swing seats they need in the rest of Britain. The inquest will now begin into how the party can have got things so drastically wrong.\n\nMr Miliband has often been made fun of for his appearance and demeanour, but in recent weeks there appeared to be a swell of support for the Labour leader â a view backed up by the polls â and going into the election Labour was confident it had fought a tight and well-structured campaign.\n\nDuring an emotional resignation speech, Mr Miliband reminded the public that he had joined the Labour party when he was 17 and said that he had ânever dreamtâ that he would one day lead it.\n\nHe went on to say that âBritain needs a Labour party that can rebuild after this defeat so that we can have a government that stands up for working people againâ.\n\nNick Clegg resigned as leader of the Liberal Democrats after his party's disastrous result. The deputy prime minister kept his Sheffield Hallam seat, which he has represented since 2005, winning a majority of only 2,353.\n\nThis was drastically lower than the 15,284 majority he gained in 2010, but not as catastrophic a reverse as his partyâs overall loss of seats. After unexpectedly winning 57 in the 2010 election, the Lib Dems are now left with eight.\n\nAt the height of his success â during what became known as âCleggmaniaâ â he was considered the most popular British politician since Winston Churchill. On resigning, Mr Clegg said that his party âwill never know how many lives we have changed for the betterâ.\n\nMr Clegg fell out of favour with voters after the last election when he entered into a coalition with the Conservatives. The publicâs sense of betrayal only increased when he reneged on his pledge not to raise tuition fees.\n\nWhat a disastrous night for Nigel Farage and his party. Despite getting almost four million votes â placing them third behind the Conservatives and Labour in the overall vote share â Ukip has lost its leader and taken only one seat.\n\nAfter defeat in South Thanet to the Conservative Craig Mackinlay â a Ukip defector, no less â Mr Farage kept to his pre-election promise and resigned. He did not go quietly, however, and even said that he would consider running for the top job again.\n\n\"There will be a leadership election for the next leader of Ukip in September and I will consider over the course of this summer whether to put my name forward to do that job again,\" Mr Farage, 51, said following his defeat in Ukipâs key target seat.\n\nâPersonally, there is a bit of me that is disappointed but there's a bit of me that is happier than I have felt for many, many years.\"\n\nCalling the first-past-the-post system âbankruptâ, Mr Farage signed off with a parting shot at the British electoral system.\n\n\"It is bankrupt because one party can get 50 per cent of the vote in Scotland and nearly 100 per cent of the seats, and our party can get 4 million votes and just one seat.\n\n\"For those reasons there are a lot of angry Ukip people out there. They're not giving up on Ukip, but absolutely determined that we get a fairer, more reflective system.\"\n\nHaving defected from the Conservatives last year, Mark Reckless was â until now â one of only two Ukip MPs. He won the Rochester & Strood seat as a notably rebellious Conservative, responsible for casting 56 votes against the whip in four years and again, for Ukip, in the controversial 2014 by-election. Despite losing his seat, Mr Reckless has confidence in his party. \"Ukip is close to getting four million votes across the country, perhaps over 13 per cent of the popular vote. I think that is a pretty impressive achievement and I don't think we should gloss over that in any way at all,â he said.\n\nThe previous shadow chancellor of the exchequer, who was once known as the âbruiserâ, Ed Balls lost his seat in Morley & Outwood to Andrea Jenkyns. The Conservatives took the seat from Labour with 39 per cent of the vote.\n\nIn 2010, Labour had 38 per cent while the Tories had 35. In conceding defeat, he said: âIâm sorry we didnât quite do enough to repeat what we did in 2010.\n\nâIâm sure the Labour party will emerge in the coming weeks and months more united, more determined.â\n\nAs people begin to contemplate who could succeed Mr Miliband as leader of the opposition, Ed Balls may well play a central role in the outcome of this scenario. His wife, Yvette Cooper, is one of the favourites.\n\nThe shadow secretary for international development and MP for East Renfrewshire emerged as a leading figure in the No campaign and the standard bearer for Labour during the independence referendum campaign last year.\n\nIn the weeks before the referendum, Mr Murphy, a former Scottish secretary, embarked on a 100-day campaign to deliver the unionist message - often from atop an Irn Bru soapbox. His fervent and, at times, unwelcome presence in communities across the country confirmed his reputation as a passionate and fearless politician.\n\nIt may have worked then, but it was not enough to defeat his SNP rival Kirsten Oswald, who ousted Mr Murphy from the seat he had held for 20 years.\n\n\"The Scottish Labour party has been around for more than a century. A hundred years from tonight we will still be around,â he said after the defeat. âScotland needs a strong Labour party and our fightback starts tomorrow morning.\"\n\nAfter his massive win in Twickenham in 2010, when the Lib Dems took home 54 per cent of the vote, the seat he held for 18 years has been lost to Tania Mathias, of the Conservatives. Dr Cable managed to secure only 38 per cent of the vote, with the Tories taking 41 per cent.\n\nâThe fact is we were hit by a very well organised national campaign,â Dr Cable said as he drew on the threat posed by Labour and the SNP.\n\nâUnfortunately this has been a terrible night for our party but I am absolutely sure we are going to bounce back both nationally and locally.â"
