        "text": "It is good party politics and probably good Coalition positioning – but it's not good government. The announcements of Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Chris Huhne, Lynne Featherstone and Danny Alexander will help keep their grass roots happy. Clamping down on executive pay, defending the 50p tax, proposing a mansion tax on the rich, promoting gay marriage, describing Conservatives as political enemies, attacking eurosceptics, and defending green levies will all obviously go down well with the Liberal Democrat's left-wing activists, who want some red meat as the price of being in power with the Tories. Huhne and Cable may be comfortable with this, but my guess is that Nick Clegg isn't.\n\nClegg is more at odds, politically, with his grass roots than either David Cameron or Ed Milliband; he is instinctively a classical liberal, both economically and socially, frustrated with the simple left-wing platitudes of his activists. When he was the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, he invited me to share the main conference platform with him so I could challenge his activists' complacency on immigration; and when he became party leader I got him to do his first big speach at Policy Exchange (of which I was then director). He made a passionate case for the party to support lower, rather than higher, taxes – or as I said when introducing him, he was trying to put the liberalism back into the Liberal Democrats. He was challenging his base, just as Cameron did when he became leader – in stark contrast to Red Ed. So pandering to his base now is out of political necessity rather than some deep-felt desire."
