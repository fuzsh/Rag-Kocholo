And shaping the metaverse is, to a large degree, a matter of definitions.\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nThe language around former UK deputy prime minister’s promotion was very telling.\n\nJanuary 26, 2016\n\nWe need to change the school admissions code.\n\nJuly 16, 2015\n\nFormer party president beats Norman Lamb in bid to replace Nick Clegg\n\nJune 2, 2015\n\nThe former Lib Dem leader remembered as anti-war orator and master communicator with a gift for relating to his audience.\n\nMay 9, 2015\n\nThis was supposed to be the “social media election” but in the end it was those who moved beyond horse-race journalism, on whatever platform, who excelled.\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\nThe shock election result means that three parties are now leaderless – how will they choose replacements?\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\nWe knew this would be a bad night for the Lib Dems but few predicted it’d be this bad. Vince Cable, Danny Alexander, Simon Hughes, Jo Swinson, Ed Davey, Lynne Featherstone and many others have lost their…\n\nMay 6, 2015\n\nIn 2010, there were more than 1,000 potential coalition options. Here’s how to make friends in 2015.\n\nMay 4, 2015\n\nSet it in stone or face the wrath of your electorate?

So far, other parties have focused on the economy, healthcare…\n\nApril 7, 2015\n\nNick Clegg is in the fight of his political life – and his battleground constituency was once one of the safest seats in the UK."
