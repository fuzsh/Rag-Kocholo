        "text": "Lynne Featherstone, a Liberal Democrat, criticised Nick Clegg, her party leader, and the “male and pale” politicians behind the coalition deal.\n\nThe new Prime Minister and Mr Clegg, his deputy, have faced criticism from equalities groups over the composition of the Cabinet. Four of the 29 ministers allowed to attend Cabinet meetings are women. All of these are Tories.\n\nMiss Featherstone was appointed to her job in the Home Office yesterday. It is one of three Whitehall departments being run by a woman.\n\nIn a radio interview, Miss Featherstone was asked what she told Mr Cameron when he appointed her. She said: “We must do better.”\n\nAll five Lib Dem Cabinet ministers are men. The Liberal Democrats have the lowest proportion of female MPs of all the main parties.\n\nMiss Featherstone admitted that her party had a long way to go on promoting women. She said: “The issue is how do you get women through the ranks of Parliament to those positions where they are then in a position to be in the Cabinet?”"
