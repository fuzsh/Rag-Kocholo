Consider The Dark Knight. It has listed "Country: USA | UK" and "Language: English | Mandarin", with filming locations in USA, UK, Hong Kong and others. Christopher Nolan is born in England.

Yet, I automatically consider this a full-on "American" movie. Why? Is this because:

Most of the actors are American?

It's produced by Warner Bros. which is an American company?

It's so impressive it could only come out of the blockbuster machine that is Hollywood?

Is there actually a clear definition of what constitutes an "American" movie?

(Another example: Dogville has a Danish director, actors from many countries who speak English, filmed inside a studio in Sweden. Is it a "Danish" movie because Von Trier is such a big part of it?)

(On a side note, The Terminator is listed with countries "UK | USA", but I doubt anyone would call it an "English" movie. This must probably be attributed to faulty data entry.)
