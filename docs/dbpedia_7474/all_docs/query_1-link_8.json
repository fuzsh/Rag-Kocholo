        "text": "During the Second World War, many in Hollywood signed up to serve their country in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)âAmericaâs first intelligence agencyâincluding prolific Oscar-winning filmmaker John Ford and legendary Disney camera effects artist Bob Broughton. Together, they created OSS training films and documented OSS activities in the field, pioneering the use of film in intelligence for generations to come.\n\nAt that time, however, Hollywood studios were prohibited from mentioning OSS in films due to secrecy. Screenwriters did their best to keep those three little letters out of wartime scripts.\n\nOn September 2, 1945, the Empire of Japan surrendered, ending World War II. That same month, President Harry Truman, skeptical that the OSS was needed in the postwar government, signed Executive Order 9621, which disbanded the organization.\n\nStill, General William Donovan, who led the OSS, would strive for the OSS legacy to persist after the war. He wanted the public to know and remember the heroics of the men and women of OSS. Donovan encouraged former OSS officers to write articles and memoirs sharing the greatness of the organizationâs missions.\n\nMany ex-OSS officers with a talent for writing headed straight to Hollywood."
