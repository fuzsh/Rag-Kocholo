I mean I want to make many movies and the idea of only being able to make one sounds completely hope-crushing. On the other end of the spectrum, I read that there is one director who made 150 movies and another who made 15 in one year. Obviously, this doesn't indicate quality but if someone can make 15 movies in one year, then it gives me some level of hope. Input?"
