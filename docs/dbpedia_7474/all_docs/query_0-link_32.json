Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostner wanted to make \"Horizon: An American Saga\" for 35 years.\n\nIn a May interview with Deadline, the actor-director revealed the idea for the film came to him in the '80s and was initially commissioned before his multi-Academy Award-winning directorial debut, \"Dances With Wolves.\"\n\nCostner said at the time he \"couldn't get anybody to make it,\" so he shelved it. According to the actor, an opportunity to bring the story to the screen presented itself again in the early 2000s shortly after the release of \"Open Range\" when Disney expressed interest, but \"a $5 million difference kept them from making\" it.\n\n\"Eight years later, I started thinking about the story, started writing with a partner, and it ended up being four screenplays,\" he said. \"So I reverse-engineered everything from 1988. I thought it was really good. But I still couldn't get anybody to make it.\"\n\nUltimately, Costner decided to finance the film, after which Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema joined the production as distributors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \"Yellowstone\" star has partly funded the project himself, mortgaging his 10-acre California property and investing $20 million.\n\nIn the same Deadline feature, Costner admitted to taking out a mortgage on a rather sizable property to fund his passion project.\n\n\"I've mortgaged 10 acres on the water in Santa Barbara where I was going to build my last house,\" he said. \"But I did it without a thought. It has thrown my accountant into a fucking conniption fit. But it's my life, and I believe in the idea and the story.\"\n\nIn court documents seen by Insider related to his recent acrimonious divorce from Baumgartner, Costner shared that in 2022, he \"contributed $20 million\" toward the film series' budget. He also stated that he had deferred his salary for the film.\n\nCostner used his money to back his films such as \"Dances with Wolves\" and \"The Postman.\" While the former became a huge success, taking home $424 million at the box office on a budget of $22 million (Costner contributed $3 million), the same can't be said for the latter. \"The Postman,\" which he backed with an undisclosed sum, was a notable failure at the box office, returning only $17.6 million on a budget of more than $85 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe films are set against the backdrop of the Civil War.\n\n\"Horizon: An American Saga\" will not only see Costner return to the director's chair but to a subject matter he has explored in his filmography: Civil War-era America.\n\nThe films, co-written by Costner and Jon Baird, will depict \"the lure of the Old West and how it was won -- and lost -- through the blood, sweat and tears of many,\" according to a synopsis.\n\n\"Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner's ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.\"\n\nSpeaking to Variety in 2022, Costner said the story focuses on women, and the female characters \"are really strong.\"\n\n\"It involves women trying to get by in a world that was impossibly tough,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSienna Miller, Sam Worthington, and more big names are set to saddle up for the saga.\n\nDetails on the characters that cast members will be playing remain a mystery for now, as the film's synopsis doesn't mention any individual characters. Instead, it states that the film's depiction of America in the 19th century will be \"experienced through the eyes of many.\"\n\nAnd many names are attached to \"Horizon: An American Saga.\" Costner told Variety in 2022 that he was casting for the films and \"trying to fill up\" 170 speaking roles.\n\nIt's now been announced that Costner will appear in the film alongside Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, and Luke Wilson.\n\nAlso in the cast are Jamie Campbell Bower, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe, and Ella Hunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first two installments will arrive in theaters in June and August next year — but could premiere earlier at a film festival.\n\n\"Horizon: An American Saga\" chapters one and two will open in cinemas on June 28, 2024, and August 16, 2024.\n\nIn court documents obtained by Insider, Costner stated that he planned to release the first film theatrically before the end of 2023, but that was before the SAG-AFTRA strike was announced.\n\nIt's likely that the actor's strike, combined with the complications of his divorce, is why the film is being released in 2024 instead.\n\nCostner also stated that he wanted to show the first film at a film festival, so we may see \"Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1\" and \"Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 2\" in the line-up at one of next year's early festivals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCostner plans to make \"Horizon: An American Saga\" a four-film franchise.\n\nWhile only two films have been announced, Costner has been vocal about his plans to tell \"Horizon\" across four feature-length films, but as of October 2023, only two have been shot so far.\n\nFilming for the third chapter was put on an indefinite pause due to the dual actors and writers strikes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the teaser trailer for \"Horizon: An American Saga\" below:\n\nRead next\n\nFilm\n\nAdvertisement"
