        "text": "No doubt, the United States is a land full of opportunities and fame. However, there are many famous people who leave the nation’s glamor due to personal reasons. Wondering who they are? Let’s explore some of the famous individuals who made the bold decision to leave the United States and what propelled them to do so.\n\n1. Tina Turner (Singer)\n\nDuring the 1960s, Tina Turner was enjoying fame for her energetic performances and hit songs. Unfortunately, she endured a tough marriage with Ike Turner. However, she did make a return in the 1980s with chart-topper songs like “What’s Love Got to Do With It.” Looking for a fresh start, Turner moved from America to Switzerland in the 90s. There, she tied the knot with German music producer Erwin Bach and even took up Swiss citizenship.\n\n2. Jim Morrison (Singer)\n\nJim Morrison – lead vocalist of legendary rock band The Doors – was renowned for his deep baritone voice & poetic lyrics. However, despite his success, he had many personal issues while he also struggled with addiction. In 1971, he moved to Paris with his partner, Pamela Courson. Unfortunately, in the same year, his life came to an abrupt end as a result of congestive heart failure in Paris when he was just 27 years old.\n\n3. Terry Gilliam (Film Director)\n\nBorn in Minnesota, Terry Gilliam is best known as part of the Monty Python comedy group and director of various hit movies. He gave up his U.S. citizenship during the early 2000s due to political reasons. Afterward, England became a sweet home for him. His move to the country, close to his former Monty Python collaborators, shows his love for British culture.\n\n4. Zac Efron (Actor)\n\nActor Zac Efron is no stranger when it comes to name and fame. He starred in High School Musical and a variety of other big films throughout his career. In 2020, he made up his mind to shift to Australia. That’s because he was captivated by the lifestyle and safety in Australia, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n5. Lindsay Lohan (Actress)\n\nChild actress Lindsay Lohan rose to fame after appearing in movies such as The Parent Trap. During 2010, many issues affected both her professional and personal life significantly. These included struggles with substance abuse and legal problems. In an effort to pursue a more tranquil lifestyle, Lohan relocated to Dubai in 2017.\n\n6. Madonna (Pop Star)\n\nPop star Madonna has been adored by people around the world for her daring and revolutionary style. After gaining enormous success across multiple locations, she chose to move to Portugal back in 2017. Her decision was partly because she wanted an environment change as well as to provide better soccer training opportunities for her son David.\n\n7. John Huston (Film Director)\n\nIn the mid-20th century, John Huston established himself as one of the pivotal directors of U.S. cinema. Despite being a commercial flop, his film The Misfits was famously the last completed movie for stars Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Although he was extremely successful in Hollywood, Ireland had drawn the director for many years. Therefore, in 1964, he decided to renounce his American nationality and become an official citizen of Ireland.\n\n8. Grace Kelly (Actress)\n\nGrace Kelly, a glamorous Hollywood star of the 1950s, won an Academy Award for The Country Girl. Her life took a dramatic turn when she met Prince Rainier III at the Cannes Film Festival in 1955. A year later, they tied the knot, and Grace became Princess Grace of Monaco. After that, she decided to relocate to Europe for her royal duties. She tragically lost her life there in an auto accident.\n\n9. Edward Snowden (Computer Intelligence Consultant)\n\nEdward Snowden, a former CIA employee, became a household name in 2013 when he exposed classified documents revealing extensive government surveillance programs. He feared that the officials would prosecute him for his act. Thus, he fled to Hong Kong and later sought refuge in Russia, where he still resides today.\n\n10. George Clooney (Actor, Director, Producer and Philanthropist)\n\nRenowned for his role as Dr. Doug Ross in the TV series ER, George Clooney is a household name. His decision to move out of the U.S. was facilitated by a property he purchased in Italy. Although it was an investment initially, his house on the shores of Lake Como attracted him a lot. Thus, he decided to make it his permanent residence in the quest for a quieter and more private life.\n\n11. Johnny Depp (Actor and Producer)\n\nJohnny Depp, famous for his versatility as an actor, gained fame from his portrayal as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. While there’s no particular reason for his choice to live outside the U.S., it might be because the actor seeks a private lifestyle. He spends most of his time in France while casually visiting his properties in the Bahamas and the English countryside.\n\n12. Janet Jackson (Pop Star)\n\nJanet Jackson, a famous pop star and the sister of Michael Jackson, achieved great success in her music career during the 1980s and 1990s. She married Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, which resulted in her relocation to Dubai. While their marriage ended in 2017, Janet decided to stay overseas anyway. At the moment, she’s residing in London.\n\nThe Best Country for Your MBTI Type\n\nHave you ever wondered which country would be the best fit for your Myers-Briggs type? Many people are interested in finding a place to live that aligns with their personality and values.\n\n➤ The Best Country for Your MBTI Type\n\nPeople Hate Living in These “Perfect” Countries\n\nLike us, lots of people want to move abroad. They dream of a new life filled with sidewalk cafés, rainforest ecotours, or midnight street food.\n\nEven if a country is ranked tops on some list or other, it doesn’t mean you will love it yourself.\n\n➤ People Hate Living in These “Perfect” Countries\n\nThe 10 Worst Reasons to Move Abroad\n\nThere are plenty of excellent reasons to move abroad, if you’re not happy with developments in the U.S. There are also terrible reasons to move. These fall mostly into two categories: trying to solve your problems without working on yourself, and taking advantage of locals. The first category just flatly doesn’t work, and the second is unethical. If you want to be unethical, stay home."
