        "text": "Star Wars\n\nstorytelling universe\n\nRecent News\n\nStar Wars, space opera storytelling universe (created by George Lucas) that is one of the most successful and influential multimedia franchises in entertainment history. Begun in the 1970s and ’80s and resuscitated at the turn of the 21st century, Star Wars continually advanced the field of motion-picture special effects and developed into an enormously lucrative merchandising industry.\n\nThe original trilogy (1977–83)\n\nLucas’s success as a writer and director with American Graffiti (1973) won him the backing of 20th Century Fox, which put up $9.5 million for the production of the first Star Wars film. The film, directed by Lucas, was in production for four years. Scenes were shot in Tunisia and Death Valley, California, and on soundstages in England. Composer John Williams contributed the soundtrack for the movie, resulting in some of the most memorable themes in cinema and securing Williams the role of composer for the next eight films in the Skywalker saga. When it was released on May 25, 1977, Star Wars met with runaway success. The movie was retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope in 1981.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nIconic Pop Culture Villains Quiz\n\nA space opera set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” the film centers on Luke Skywalker—played by a then relatively unknown Mark Hamill—a young man who finds himself embroiled in an interplanetary war between an authoritarian empire and rebel forces. Skywalker meets two mechanical “droids” that set him on a quest to find Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), whom he knows as a desert hermit and mystic. The Galactic Empire, searching for the droids, destroys Skywalker’s family home. Skywalker, his droids, and Kenobi enlist the opportunistic smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his partner, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), to help them rescue Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from captivity. She’s held on a massive space station commanded by the menacing Darth Vader, whose deep mechanically augmented voice contributed by James Earl Jones became instantly iconic.\n\nSpace opera\n\nA subgenre of science fiction, a space opera is an action-adventure tale that incorporates the technology and galactic scale of science fiction and interstellar conflict with timeless storytelling archetypes such as the hero’s journey. Author E.E. Smith has been credited with inventing the space opera.\n\nAt the core of the film, and the larger series, is the Force, an all-pervasive spiritual essence that holds in balance the forces of good and evil. The Jedi Order is a monk-like organization dedicated to peace and the light side of the Force, while the Sith exploit base impulses and the Force’s dark side.\n\nThough A New Hope initially opened in only 42 theaters, the film earned almost $3 million in its first week and had grossed more than $100 million domestically by the end of the summer. The film won six Academy Awards along with a special-achievement award for accomplishments in sound, and it revolutionized the motion-picture industry with its advancements in special effects. Lucas’s effects company, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), designed a slew of imaginative alien creatures and droids that populated a variety of exotic locales. Perhaps most impressive, however, were the elaborate space battles accomplished with scaled miniatures. The series continued to make remarkable advancements in the field of special effects into the 21st century, and ILM became one of the most successful effects studios utilized by Hollywood.\n\nLucas followed the first Star Wars film by writing and producing two sequels, but he left the director’s chair. Irvin Kershner directed Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back (1980), lauded by some as the greatest of the entire Star Wars series. The Empire Strikes Back took the audience to the front lines of the war between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire, greatly expanding the Star Wars universe and its lore. The film introduced Jedi Master Yoda, a deceptively small, elderly, and powerful green alien. Yoda would go on to become one of the lasting symbols of Star Wars, in part due to his peculiar dialogue provided by puppeteer and voice actor Frank Oz. The smooth-talking Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) also made his debut. Toward the end of the film, Vader reveals that he is, in fact, Skywalker’s father, in a twist considered to be one of the greatest in cinematic history.\n\nMany fans recall Darth Vader’s unforgettable paternal revelation as the line “Luke, I am your father.” In fact, the line is “No, I am your father.” The plot twist was kept a secret on set until the film’s release—only George Lucas, Mark Hamill, and Irvin Kershner knew the line would be dubbed later.\n\nThe final film in the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi (1983), was directed by Richard Marquand. The movie saw Skywalker, having finished his training as a Jedi, put an end to the war with the rebels’ victory and bring his father, Vader, back to the light side of the Force. It also included another familial bombshell: Princess Leia, with whom Skywalker had entertained a possible romantic relationship and even kissed, was in fact his twin sister. Leia instead pursues the roguish Han Solo.\n\nOver the next two decades, the franchise thrived through the release of videos, comic books, novels, and a substantial merchandise line.\n\nThe prequel trilogy (1999–2005)\n\nMore than 20 years after the first film premiered, Lucas began filming a second trilogy of films depicting events that had transpired before those in the original series. Lucas returned to the role of director and utilized a new cast of popular young actors, including Ewan McGregor as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Natalie Portman as the daring monarch and politician Padmé Amidala. Lucas also took full advantage of recent innovations in computer-generated imagery (CGI). In 1997 Lucas released “special editions” of the original three films that included new and revised scenes incorporating CGI.\n\nThe shot heard around the galaxy\n\nMany of George Lucas’s 1997 edits to the original Star Wars trilogy were cosmetic, but some fans took issue with changes made to one of Han Solo’s (Harrison Ford) early scenes in Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope. In the re-release, Solo shoots and kills the bounty hunter Greedo in self-defense, while in the original scene, Solo simply shoots the alien in cold blood. Fans took up the rallying cry “Han shot first” to defend their beloved—if morally dubious—character as he was originally written.\n\nTwo years after the trilogy was re-released, Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace (1999) arrived in theaters. The film followed unconventional Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, the young Kenobi, as they navigated a starkly different galaxy set more than 30 years before the events of A New Hope. The two Jedi uncover a new threat—the Jedi Order’s historic enemies, the Sith, have resurfaced—as well as a new potential Jedi: an enslaved child by the name of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Jinn becomes convinced that Skywalker is the chosen one, destined to bring balance to the Force. When Jinn is slain by the Sith lord Darth Maul (Ray Park), Kenobi takes on Skywalker as his apprentice.\n\nIn Star Wars: Episode II—Attack of the Clones (2002), Skywalker, now a young man played by Hayden Christensen, and Kenobi battle the Sith lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) during the onset of the Clone Wars. As the war wages on, Skywalker secretly falls in love and marries Natalie Portman’s Padmé Amidala, breaking Jedi code. Star Wars: Episode III—Revenge of the Sith (2005) chronicles Skywalker’s fall to the dark side of the Force, his transformation into Darth Vader, and the rise of the Galactic Empire led by the maniacal Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).\n\nEach film in the prequel trilogy was a box-office success, although they received markedly less critical acclaim than the original trilogy. The Star Wars franchise, however, remained incredibly lucrative into the 21st century. It included not only clothing, action figures, and multiple extensive book series but also the animated feature film and series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2020)—which depicted Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ahsoka Tano during the period of war between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith—and numerous successful video game lines created by another of Lucas’s companies, LucasArts. By the time the sixth film was released in 2005, nearly 30 years after the series began, it was estimated that the franchise as a whole had brought in some $20 billion, an achievement then unparalleled in the motion picture industry.\n\nThe sequel trilogy (2015–19)\n\nA seventh film, Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens, was released in 2015. It was the first entry in the series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company, which had purchased Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. The film, which was directed by J.J. Abrams, introduced new characters to the Star Wars mythos and expounded upon the stories of favorites such as Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia Organa, now a general of the resistance. Again, the filmmakers used relatively unknown actors for the lead roles, including Daisy Ridley as protagonist Rey, a scavenger who comes face to face with the oppressive First Order, headed by the troubled Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Ren, whose original name is Ben Solo, is the son of Han Solo and Princess Leia, therefore the grandson of Anakin Skywalker. Overall, the plot largely mimicked that of A New Hope. The Force Awakens would be the first movie in the sequel trilogy, the final act in the nine-part Skywalker saga. It surpassed $2 billion in the worldwide box office, setting the record for the third highest-grossing movie in history.\n\nFamiliar face\n\nOscar Isaac became very familiar with acting in large franchises like Star Wars, in which he plays the maverick pilot Poe Dameron for all three movies of the sequel trilogy. He later played multiple characters in Marvel Comics media: the supervillain Apocalypse in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), both Steven Grant and Marc Spector in Moon Knight, and Miguel O’Hara in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Outside of Disney-owned franchises, Isaac assumed the role of Duke Leto Atreides in Dune (2021).\n\nStar Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi (2017), directed by Rian Johnson, carried on the saga with the reintroduction of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker. The film received positive reviews from critics but divided the fan base, leaving producers to choose a new director for the final movie in the trilogy. With Abrams returning as director, Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker was released in 2019 and completed the Skywalker saga that began more than 40 years previously with A New Hope. The movie brought back Ian McDiarmid’s Emperor Palpatine and revealed that Luke Skywalker had attempted to train his sister, Leia, as a Jedi. Rey discovered her lineage as the granddaughter of Palpatine and finally balanced the force by defeating him and the First Order. Like his grandfather Vader, Ben Solo was redeemed and his sacrifice turned the tide of the war. Although financially successful, critics largely believed the movie leaned too heavily into fan service.\n\nAbout this time, Disney also released the stand-alone films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), each billed as “A Star Wars Story.” The former was the first live-action Star Wars film that was not part of the Skywalker saga and grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. Some critics called it the best Star Wars movie since Disney acquired the franchise. Solo, meanwhile, received mixed reviews and underperformed in the box office.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Disney also opened the attraction Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge in two of its theme parks. With more than 14 acres dedicated to the immersive Star Wars experience, it was the largest expansion in Disney parks history.\n\nDisney+ era (2019–present)\n\nThe Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012, and sought to offer a video streaming service that collected its many properties in film and television including Star Wars, the Marvel cinematic universe, and Pixar. Thus, the Disney+ platform launched on November 12, 2019, about a month before the theatrical release of The Rise of Skywalker. On the day of its launch, Disney debuted the television series The Mandalorian on Disney+ with Pedro Pascal in the titular role. It was the first Star Wars television show to be live action.\n\nCreated by veteran actor, writer, director, and producer Jon Favreau, The Mandalorian was an instant phenomenon. Its fresh take on Star Wars, initially separate from the characters and storylines of the Skywalker saga, garnered rave reviews. The series followed Din Djarin, a Mandalorian bounty hunter who is assigned to capture a Force-sensitive infant. The Child, whose name is later revealed to be Grogu, is of the same alien species as Yoda. This character—dubbed “Baby Yoda” online—won the hearts of fans new and old while presenting an enormous marketing opportunity for Disney, which used Grogu’s image across all manner of merchandise. With positive critical reception as well as high viewership, The Mandalorian would go on to be the flagship Star Wars title among the Disney+ original series.\n\nBuilding off events covered in The Mandalorian, Disney launched several spin-off series using characters already established within the Star Wars universe. The Book of Boba Fett (2021–22) centered on the bounty hunter Boba Fett from the original trilogy, while Dave Filoni’s Ahsoka (begun 2023) brought characters from his animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels (2014–18), particularly Anakin Skywalker’s apprentice Ahsoka Tano (Rosario Dawson), to live action. Filoni also created two other animated series for Disney+, Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi (2022) and Star Wars: Tales of the Empire (2024). Favreau and Filoni, who was made chief creative officer for Lucasfilm in 2023, established themselves as heralds of a new era of Star Wars for a new generation of fans.\n\nMeanwhile, other Disney+ series were unrelated to the characters from The Mandalorian. Andor (begun 2022), created by Tony Gilroy, unveils the backstory of a character from the 2016 film Rogue One: Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). The show completely eschewed mention of the Jedi, the Sith, or the Force, once all core elements of the Star Wars franchise. Instead, it focused on the human struggles of a burgeoning rebellion underneath the boot of an oppressive fascist regime. Hailed as one of the best original Star Wars series on Disney+, Andor also earned a large viewership; however, it tailed behind bigger titles such as Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022), in which Ewan McGregor reprised his role as the titular Jedi and once again faced off against Darth Vader, played by Hayden Christensen. Other series went in the opposite direction of Andor: The Acolyte (2024), set about a century before the events of the Skywalker saga, emphasized the role of the Jedi in the Star Wars universe and featured engaging displays of the Force and lightsaber combat. The Acolyte also incorporated elements from books and comics that Disney published under the series title Star Wars: The High Republic.\n\nEven in the Disney+ era, Star Wars continued to push the boundaries of special effects: filmmakers and showrunners used a mix of both CGI and practical effects as they sought to create an aesthetic that balanced 1970s nostalgia with a contemporary feel.\n\n“Canon” vs. “legends”\n\nWith nearly a half century of stories under the Star Wars banner, Lucasfilm Ltd. and its related organizations have amassed a gargantuan corpus of lore across numerous media formats. When the Walt Disney Company obtained the franchise in 2012, it aimed to consolidate and organize these stories to make room for its own Star Wars content. Thus, Disney officially split the Star Wars universe into “canon” and “legends.”\n\nCanon stories—namely all 11 movies and most major television shows on Disney+ as well as a select few books, comics, and video games—represent the single timeline of the overall Star Wars story. Legends, also known as the “Expanded Universe,” include all other Star Wars media that, while officially branded Star Wars and controlled by Disney, do not contribute to the main storyline. This distinction is important for fans, who seek a coherent and stable Star Wars universe even at the cost of watching favorite storylines drop from canon. Disney’s changes also work at a commercial level, maximizing opportunities for new storytellers to use profitable Star Wars tropes and characters without jeopardizing the existing value of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nDylan Shulman"
