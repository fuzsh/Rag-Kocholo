        "text": "Since Roger passed away, the day after and throughout the past year, there has an outpouring from filmmakers and journalists who loved Roger. This is just a selection of what they have written about Roger.\n\nBEN AFFLECK\n\n“I went and visited Roger\n\nlast summer and talked about ‘Argo.’ I was in his home, and met his wife and\n\nsaw how tough (conditions) were after his surgery. I was so moved by the\n\ncheerfulness that he had toward this, the sort of way that he bore that burden.\n\nI mean, for days after I left — he gave me a copy of his book and I read it, I\n\njust was so inspired by that. By a guy who was fighting something that was\n\nreally debilitating, and was so gracious and warm and loved life.\n\nIt just broke my heart to\n\nhear that he died,” he said. “And the fact that he wrote his last\n\nreview of (‘To the Wonder’); it was viewed through the prism of this wonderful\n\nman who was at the very end of his life. And to see the movie through that lens\n\nwas one of the most powerful things to ever happen to me in my career.”\n\nDARREN ARONOFSKY\n\n“For all film lovers, he\n\nwas a legend. I can remember looking forward to his and Siskel’s show as a kid,\n\non local channel 11 – or was it 9? That empty balcony. The teasers at the start,\n\nthe movie you really wanted to hear about at the end. Rooting for a\n\ndisagreement, a respectful yet stinging argument.\n\nI ended up meeting him\n\nand his charming wife in an elevator at the Toronto Film Festival when I was\n\nthere with ‘Requiem for a Dream.’ It was like meeting a childhood\n\nidol.\n\nHe told me how ‘Pi’ was\n\none of the last films Gene had reviewed, and that he had loved it. Turns out\n\nGene was a math nut and also very religious. It meant the world to me. And the\n\nday I got those two thumbs up it meant bragging rights for a lifetime.\n\nEbert finished our\n\nelevator ride with asking for a picture with me. With me?! It was an honor and\n\nI only wish I had had a camera with me.”\n\nRAMIN BAHRANI\n\n“He had an ability to\n\ntalk about any movie, no matter how complex, in a way that anyone would\n\nunderstand. On one hand, you have very intellectual critics, and on the other\n\nhand, you have the paparazzi. He had a way to cut through it all and go right\n\nto the heart of it without a lot of fancy talk, which is really hard to do. He\n\nwasn’t just a great critic, but he had lived a great life.”\n\nDANNY BOYLE\n\n“For me, the great thing\n\nabout coming here to America and releasing films is that this nation is\n\nobsessed with movies. Despite all the comings and goings in papers and blogs,\n\npeople are obsessed with movies the way filmmakers are obsessed with them. And\n\nRoger was a great inspiration like that, and a great man. He loved film, and he\n\nremained so right until the end.”\n\nCAMERON CROWE\n\n“Roger Ebert.\n\nClear-eyed dreamer, king of the written word…”\n\nLEE DANIELS\n\n“Roger was really\n\nsupportive of all of my films, as a producer and a director. I got a chance to\n\nmeet him several times and hang with him and his beautiful wife, too. Sometimes\n\npeople are mean-spirited when they review your films, and with Roger, he found\n\nthe good in my movies. I was blessed I didn’t get his thumbs-down, even with\n\nfilms that were not necessarily celebrated in Hollywood. He got me as a\n\nfilmmaker. He was just a wonderful human being, a kind soul. Critics are set up\n\nto just jump on you. You put a year and a half of life into something for\n\ncritics to just attack. But he wanted to like all movies. He was looking\n\nforward to enjoying a film; that’s how he began his critic’s process. I held\n\nhis opinion in high regard. He will be sorely missed.”\n\nCHAZ EBERT\n\n“He fought a courageous\n\nfight. I’ve lost the love of my life, and the world has lost a visionary and a\n\ncreative and generous spirit who touched so many people all over the world. We\n\nhad a lovely, lovely life together, more beautiful and epic than a movie. It\n\nhad its highs and the lows, but was always experienced with good humor, grace\n\nand a deep abiding love for each other.”\n\nMIA FARROW\n\n“If cancer came to take\n\nme piece by piece, I hope I could summon even a fraction of the grace Roger\n\nEbert showed us, in such abundance.”\n\nDAVID GORDON GREEN\n\n“The most meaningful moment I had with Roger was at the Toronto Film\n\nFestival when I was there with my third movie [“Undertow“] and he’d\n\nresponded really favorably to it. He was running to a movie and I was\n\nrunning to a movie in a different direction and we said “Hey” to each\n\nother and he introduced me to Chaz. He’s like, “The movies can wait but\n\nthis introduction can never happen again.” I loved the moment of him\n\nwanting to introduce a filmmaker to his wife. I thought that was an\n\nincredible pause in our hectic, frantic festival life to have that kind\n\nof a human moment.”\n\nWERNER HERZOG\n\n“Four decades back, at\n\nthe time I was releasing my film ‘Aguirre: The Wrath of God,’ he was very\n\nenthusiastic about it and very helpful about it because he put it on his list\n\n— I think it was the 10 best of all time — and it opened somehow the\n\ncuriosity of American audiences.\n\nWe did not meet very\n\noften. I can’t even say we were real friends because we did not see each other\n\noften enough. But we had a different understanding about cinema, and we had a\n\nvery deep respect for each other’s work. That was more what connected us.\n\nI always kept talking\n\nabout him as the good soldier of cinema, because he started to call me that,\n\nand I said, “No, it fits you much better.” The last 10 years, he was a wounded\n\nsoldier. But I always have a deep admiration for those who soldier on until\n\nthere is no breath left in them.\n\nHe had a deep\n\nunderstanding of the elements of cinema. He was always looking for a stratum of\n\ntruth, a silver lining of truth and how to accomplish it.\n\nI was asked if his\n\nwriting informed my films. No, it did not. Did the fact that we were in friends\n\nin a way change the course of my life? The answer is no. But knowing him made\n\nit better.\n\nHis demise marks the end\n\nof an epoch. I’m speaking of an epoch where we had serious discourse about\n\nfilm.\n\nThere was a fire within\n\nmany people to talk about and write about and discuss movies. All this in the\n\nlast two decades, all this has irrevocably and inexorably shifted into celebrity\n\nnews. You can see that in print and on television. ‘Siskel & Ebert’ doesn’t\n\nexist. The replacement now is celebrity news. In the print media, one newspaper\n\nafter another abandons its critics. They’re being replaced by celebrity news.\n\nIt’s not just the invention of the media. It’s a big cultural shift. It has to\n\ndo with audiences, it has to do with a massive, overwhelming trend. Because of\n\nthat, Roger marked an epoch, which is not completely but is almost very much\n\nover.\n\nThere will be a long,\n\nlong echo [of his work] reverberating for a long, long time… I’ve always tried\n\nto be a good soldier of cinema myself, so of course since he’s gone, I will\n\nplow on, as I have plowed on all my life, but I will do what I have to do as if\n\nRoger was looking over my shoulder. And I am not gonna disappoint him.”\n\nPATTY JENKINS\n\n“Making ‘Monster’ was a\n\nhuge uphill battle. It was a tiny movie with very little money, and every step\n\nwas a struggle. Even the decision to cast Charlize Theron: Today it looks\n\nbrilliant, but at the time it made us a laughingstock because she was seen as\n\nmuch too beautiful to play serial killer Aileen Wuornos. We had no money to\n\nrelease the film, and instead of doing the festival circuit, the producers\n\ndecided to put it out in screenings just days after we finished it. It was a\n\ndodgy proposal that this film would ever find its audience.\n\nThen out of nowhere comes\n\nRoger Ebert with this amazing review, calling Charlize’s work ‘one of the\n\ngreatest performances in the history of cinema.’ And when the movie started to\n\nget press — thanks to him — he kept talking about it, he kept engaging with\n\nit, addressing the other critics and really keeping the momentum going.\n\nWhen you make a film, you\n\nstruggle over every detail and you expect people to reflect your ideas and\n\nintentions back to you in very vague terms. But Roger saw completely what I was\n\ntrying to do and reflected it back to me in words; he saw things that even\n\npeople who were working with me didn’t see: that this film was an education in\n\nthe human experience, letting you walk in the shoes of someone who is\n\ntechnically the worst kind of monster so that you can see how a person ends up\n\nin that situation. He understood that I wasn’t making a value judgment or\n\njustifying her actions, but simply trying to show how you could end up being a\n\ndifferent person than you think.\n\nWhen I won the\n\nIndependent Spirit Award [for best first feature], I saw that he was there\n\nacross the room, and I spent a good part of my speech talking about what he had\n\ndone for the film — how every time it looked like the film was down for the\n\ncount, Roger Ebert would speak up for it and do something to keep it alive.\n\nWhen I said that he in particular was someone who had always given this kind of\n\nsupport to smaller, independent films, the room gave him a standing ovation.\n\nI met him for the first\n\ntime that night, and we had a wonderful moment. I wish that I knew how to give\n\nback more to someone like him. He was the critic whose thoughts I most wanted\n\nto hear on my work, and I’m sad that he won’t be around for that next time.”\n\nSPIKE LEE\n\n“I miss my dear friend,\n\nRoger Ebert. Roger was one of the first major movie critics to support my\n\nJoints, especially ‘Malcolm X’ and ‘Do the Right Thing.’ R.I.P.”\n\nVIRGINIA MADSEN\n\n“I first met Roger in\n\n1986. He interviewed my mother, Elaine, brother Michael and me for a story in\n\nthe Sun-Times titled, “Mother Madsen’s Dream Comes True.” This was big-time for\n\nme. This meant real success. Roger Ebert interviewing us? Wow. We all gathered\n\nat Elaine’s apartment just off Wells Street on Burton Way. Roger was just like\n\nyou’d hoped he would be. Engaging, intelligent … and that laugh! It was very\n\nexciting for me, and I tried to stay cool. I had a habit of tousling my hair and\n\ngiggling when nervous, and that was not at all who I wanted to be at the time.\n\nRoger didn’t seem to mind. He had a way of looking right into your eyes and\n\ndrawing out who you really were. I knew he didn’t see me as a “bombshell” —\n\nwhich is how I was being labeled at the time — or Michael as a villain or my\n\nmother as just another pretty face. He just saw us as a Midwestern family that\n\nagainst all odds had made it out. I asked him why he wanted to interview us. He\n\nsaid, “I see something in you. I think you’re unusual. You are all filmmakers,\n\nand I guess I wanted to know why. I think you are all going to do some very\n\nimportant things.” Young and passionate, I tried not to be silly and start\n\ncrying, but I might have, just a bit. When someone believes in you, you\n\nremember that for a lifetime.\n\nMany years later, when it\n\nwas my turn at the Oscars, Roger was a champion for the film Sideways. He was\n\ncheering me on all throughout the awards season for my best supporting actress\n\nnomination. I got to hug him before and after the big show. He knew how far I’d\n\ncome. He knew how much I’d been through. I still felt like a starlet next to\n\nhim, only now I had a thicker skin. He still had his great laugh. Even when\n\nthat sound was taken from him and he would write on a small notepad, you could\n\nstill hear that laugh.”\n\nLEONARD MALTIN\n\n“If there was any\n\ndownside to [‘Siskel and Ebert’’s] television success, it was that so many\n\npeople only knew them from that medium and never sought out their printed\n\nreviews. I was one of those people. It was only with the invention of the\n\nInternet that I began reading Roger’s reviews, on his comprehensive website,\n\nand marveling at his writing skill. He is the only critic I know who\n\nunashamedly drew on his life experiences to explain his feelings about a given\n\nmovie. It wasn’t a gimmick, and it never made him seem self-absorbed, just\n\ndisarmingly candid.”\n\nMICHAEL MOORE\n\n“Roger Ebert was the\n\nchampion of the underdog filmmaker. Early on, he told middle America about\n\nSpike Lee and Errol Morris and Ang Lee and myself and so many others. He gave\n\nas much attention to an obscure but brilliant foreign film as he did to a\n\nHollywood blockbuster. He was a fierce advocate for art and free speech and for\n\nstamping out the ignorance that seems at times to be the lifeblood of this\n\ncountry. He answered only to himself and if you made a good movie he wasn’t\n\ngoing to shut up until everyone saw it. He even started a film festival in the\n\nIllinois town where he went to college called The Roger Ebert Overlooked Film\n\nFestival — for movies that didn’t get proper distribution but were brilliant.\n\nOver a decade ago, before\n\nhe got cancer, he sent me a personal letter about how he was going to lose\n\nweight and get healthy — and told me I should join him. I eventually did, and I\n\nbegan down the long, slow road to a better self. He lost something like a\n\nhundred pounds and never felt better. And then cancer struck.\n\nBut he never gave up –\n\nand I mean never. He was working last week. I’m certain most of us would have\n\nthrown in the towel by the time half of our face was removed. Not Roger. I\n\nvisited him at his home after my last film was released and had a nice talk\n\nwith him through this contraption on his computer that did the ‘talking’ for\n\nhim. He commented on my use of Catholic priests in the film – priests who\n\nreferred to capitalism as a sin of greed — and thought that was a very good way\n\nto convey the message to the public. But then he handed me a book to read by\n\nRichard Dawkins, the renowned atheist. He encouraged me to read it. He didn’t\n\nbelieve there were going to be any pearly gates for him when he died.\n\nWhen I left his Chicago\n\ntownhouse, I said to one of my crew members, ‘I think that’s the last time I\n\nwill probably see him.’\n\nIt was.”\n\nERROL MORRIS\n\n“Words fail me. Is it\n\nunusual to talk about loving a film critic? In this case, no. I truly loved\n\nRoger. And can’t believe he is gone.”\n\nCHRISTOPHER NOLAN\n\n“Roger really to me has\n\nbeen emblematic of a wonderful everyman approach to criticism. He never became\n\njaded… even while bringing a very thoughtful critical eye. Roger being such a\n\nwarm and friendly personality put a personal stamp on his reviews and helped to\n\nfight that reduction of film criticism to a simple number. When you have a\n\nrelationship with a film critic like Roger Ebert… you were getting a really\n\ncohesive and coherent idea of what a film might have to offer.”\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\n\n“For a generation of\n\nAmericans — and especially Chicagoans — Roger was the movies. When he didn’t\n\nlike a film, he was honest; when he did, he was effusive — capturing the unique\n\npower of the movies to take us somewhere magical.\n\nEven amidst his own\n\nbattles with cancer, Roger was as productive as he was resilient — continuing\n\nto share his passion and perspective with the world. The movies won’t be the\n\nsame without Roger, and our thoughts and prayers are with Chaz and the rest of\n\nthe Ebert family.”\n\nPATTON OSWALT\n\n“Roger, I hope you’re in\n\nan infinite movie palace, watching every film the great directors only dreamed\n\nof making. RIP, Roger.”\n\nMICHAEL PHILLIPS\n\n“He saw, and felt, and\n\ndescribed the movies more effectively, more cinematically, and more warmly than\n\njust about anyone writing about anything. Even his pans had a warmth to them.\n\nEven when you disagreed with Roger you found yourself imagining the movie he\n\nsaw, and loved (or hated) more than you did.\n\n“I came late to film\n\ncriticism in Chicago, after writing about the theater. Roger loved the theater.\n\nHis was a theatrical personality: a raconteur, a spinner of dinner-table\n\nstories, a man who was not shy about his accomplishments. But he made room in\n\nthat theatrical, improbable, outsized life for others.”\n\nROBERT REDFORD\n\n“Roger Ebert was one of\n\nthe great champions of freedom of artistic expression. When the power of\n\nindependent film was still unknown and few would support it, Roger was there\n\nfor our artists. His personal passion for cinema was boundless, and that is\n\nsure to be his legacy for generations to come.”\n\nJASON REITMAN\n\n“I spoke with Roger Ebert\n\nperhaps a dozen times, but only heard his voice once.\n\nI first caught him at the\n\nToronto Film Festival, where I had a short film in the program. I was 21 years\n\nold and I needed to shake his hand. I needed to thank him for being a part of\n\nmy relationship with movies for as long as I could remember. I needed him to\n\nknow that now I was a director, even if I only had 16 measly minutes to my\n\nname. I needed him to know that while infinitesimally small, I too was now a\n\nparticle in the cinematic universe in which he was a force that had touched\n\nanyone who had ever picked up a camera or sat in a theater.\n\nLike he’d done countless\n\ntimes in his life for others, Roger Ebert stopped and spoke to me. Even happily\n\ngranted a photo. And for that moment, Roger made me feel like I had directed\n\n‘The Godfather.’\n\nAfter he lost his voice\n\nin 2006 following cancer surgery, I met Roger almost exclusively for\n\ninterviews. His was the first face I saw when the lights came up after ‘Juno’’s\n\npremiere in Toronto. I lifted Ellen Page in the air, looked to my side, and saw\n\nRoger beaming as he applauded. The following day, I was invited to his hotel\n\nroom for one of his first non-vocal interviews. His language software simultaneously\n\nthrilled him and completely frustrated him. What I remember most was making\n\nRoger laugh, for without his voice, Roger laughed with his thumbs.\n\nIn 2010, I was fortunate\n\nenough to be included in the San Francisco Film Festival tribute to Roger,\n\nwhere directors like Philip Kaufman, Errol Morris, and Terry Zwigoff sang a\n\ncritic’s praises, expressing their gratitude for his reviews, even the brutal\n\nones. For when Roger loved a film, he loved it … and when he hated a film, one\n\ncouldn’t help but sense a frustration for the film it could have been.\n\nIf the cinematic\n\nexperience brings a room of strangers together, bonding our hopes and fears,\n\nRoger Ebert somehow connected those rooms. And he did so with that thumb. A\n\ngesture so simple and beloved that it made it easy to forget that he was a\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning wordsmith.\n\nTo be reviewed by Roger\n\nEbert, good or bad, was to exist as a filmmaker. Artistry aside, this is one\n\nreason we make movies. We write and direct for the same reason we conceive\n\nchildren and build buildings. We’re looking for proof of our own thumbprint, a\n\nreassurance that we somehow matter. As a filmmaker, sometimes that comes from\n\nhearing an audience’s laughter or buying a ticket to your own film. However,\n\nthere was nothing like – and I’ve confirmed this with many directors – the\n\nsight of Ebert’s thumb on your movie poster. Up or down.\n\nMy heart goes out to his\n\nwife, Chaz, the staff of the Sun-Times, the people of Chicago, and anyone who\n\nhas ever been lost in a movie.”\n\nRICHARD ROEPER\n\n“Roger would have told me\n\nto stop fretting and start writing. After hearing the terribly sad news of the\n\npassing of my writing hero, my friend, my television partner, I sat at the\n\nkeyboard and tried to come up with the perfect lead to sum up my feelings about\n\nRoger Ebert’s death.”\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE\n\n“Back in the ’80s, my\n\ncareer was at a low ebb. My last two pictures hadn’t made money and were made\n\nat a transitional moment in Hollywood, after ‘Heaven’s Gate.’ My first attempt\n\nto make ‘The Last Temptation of Christ’ fell apart at the very last minute, I\n\nwas absolutely exhausted and I thought, ‘OK, this is it, I probably won’t be\n\nable to make any more pictures.’ I wasn’t talking much, I wasn’t going out; I\n\nwould see only a few people here and there. And then one day, completely out of\n\nthe blue, I received an invitation from Roger and Gene Siskel to be the\n\nhonoree at that year’s Night of the Stars in Toronto. It was just what I\n\nneeded; it actually helped to bring me back to life. Roger knew that, I think,\n\nbut he didn’t present it that way — he was always encouraging, always\n\naffirming, but without making a show of it. Roger was just there for me, in a\n\nway that few people in my life have ever been. It meant the world to me.\n\nThe death of Roger Ebert\n\nis an incalculable loss for movie culture and for film criticism. And it’s a\n\nloss for me personally. Roger was always supportive, he was always right there\n\nfor me when I needed it most, when it really counted – at the very beginning,\n\nwhen every word of encouragement was precious; and then again, when I was at\n\nthe lowest ebb of my career, there he was, just as encouraging, just as warmly\n\nsupportive. There was a professional distance between us, but then I could talk\n\nto him much more freely than I could to other critics. Really, Roger was my\n\nfriend. It’s that simple.\n\nFew people I’ve known in\n\nmy life loved or cared as much about movies. I know that’s what kept him going\n\nin those last years – his life-or-death passion for movies, and his wonderful wife,\n\nChaz.\n\nWe all knew that this\n\nmoment was coming, but that doesn’t make the loss any less wrenching. I’ll miss\n\nhim — my dear friend, Roger Ebert.”\n\nKEVIN SMITH\n\n“Dammit! Roger Ebert died. My review: An iconic\n\ngame-changer, Roger brought film criticism AND movie-loving to the mainstream.\n\n2 Thumbs up.”\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG\n\n“Roger loved movies. They\n\nwere his life. His reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs\n\ndown. He wrote with passion through a real knowledge of film and film history,\n\nand in doing so, helped many movies find their audiences. Along with Gene\n\nShalit, Joel Siegel, and of course Gene Siskel, Roger put television\n\ncriticism on the map. Roger’s passing is virtually the end of an era and now\n\nthe balcony is closed forever.”\n\nOLIVER STONE\n\n“What marked Roger was love. A sense of love for this craft, a love for movies, and for watching movies, that was deep and\n\nspiritual. That’s why he loved Marty [Scorsese] so much, because Marty was very\n\nspiritual about it, like a priest. Roger had a bit of that. Even if he\n\ndidn’t care for a film, he would write his review in a way that did not\n\nexcoriate the filmmaker, it seems to me.”\n\nHARVEY WEINSTEIN\n\n“Roger Ebert was a\n\npassionate critic who understood that he needed to not only appraise films but\n\nbe a champion of cinema. He was always on the side of movies that needed that\n\nextra push. The only thing that tops him as a writer was his kindness as a\n\nhuman being. I will miss Roger very much and my heart goes out to Chaz and the\n\nentire family.”\n\nROBERT ZEMECKIS"
