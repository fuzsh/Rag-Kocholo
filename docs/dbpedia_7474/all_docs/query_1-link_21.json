        "text": "Forgotten today, Marcella Albani was an idol of the European cinema in the final years of the 1920s, making dozens of films in five different countries (Italy, Germany, Austria, France and Czechoslovakia). After sound came, her popularity declined and she turned to writing. One of her novels \"La Citt√† dell'amore\" was even adapted for the big screen by Mario Franchini, her husband. She went on acting until 1936. After a final appearance in Luis Trenker Der Kaiser von Kalifornien (1936), she retired from acting and led a peaceful life at the Ligurian Coast. Born in 1899, Marcella Albani had been discovered twenty years afterward by writer-director Guido Parish with whom she formed a very successful team. The couple made nearly all their respective films together (mainly tearjerkers and adventure yarns) until 1924 when they parted company. Their first movies were made in Italy until Parish decided to go to Germany. Marcella followed her mentor - who had changed his name to Guido Schamberg - there, and she met with instant success. Very exotic as the elegant Latin lady against a German backdrop, she enraptured German males in flicks such as Frauenschicksal (1923), Das Spiel der Liebe (1924) or Die Flucht in den Zirkus (1926). When she became freelance, she was occasionally chosen by important directors like Joe May, Friedrich Zelnik' or William Dieterle. One thing leading to another Marcella Albani made no fewer than fifty-odd films in only seventeen years. She was not even sixty when, having fallen into oblivion, she died of a brain tumor. Will she be rediscovered some day?\n\nJose Paige was given the screen name Don Alvarado by studio chief Jack L. Warner while they purportedly were driving past the Los Angeles street Alvarado. Paige played a number of starring roles that relied on his Latin good looks, and masculine build, achieving a certain following as a Rudolph Valentino type. He was barely 17 when he left his native Albuquerque and came to Los Angeles where he became fast friends with fellow struggling actor Gilbert Roland. Paige met his future wife Ann Boyar while both were still teenagers and the young couple married and soon after had a daughter named Joy. After six years of marriage Ann Page fell in love with Jack Warner and the marriage to Paige dissolved. Warner waited several more years until his parents died before he divorced his wife, Irma, and married Ann. When asked why she had divorced Paige to marry Warner, Ann Warner joked, \"the talkies, of course.\" In 1928 Warner's studio had ushered in the sound era, and Paige's career like those of so many other silent actors, had suffered. He continued to act, but in supporting roles. He and Ann remained friends, though, and after a long career as an assistant director, Paige was asked by his former wife if he might like to manage the 80,000 acre Arizona cattle ranch she had purchased with Warner. Page had grown up in cattle country, was an experienced horseman and spoke Spanish. He accepted the job and by all accounts was a respected and much-liked manager.\n\nThe son of a travelling salesman and a department store merchandise demonstrator, Arthur was obliged to fend for himself from an early age, selling newspapers and working at starvation wages for a condiment manufacturer. Although underage, he escaped from this life by joining the Bugle Corps at the outset of World War One. His experience in army shows as a comedian and singer encouraged him to try for an acting career.\n\nAgain a civilian, Arthur took advantage of a government program to enroll at a dramatic school run by the wife of prominent Shakespearian actor/producer Sir Frank Benson. Deciding to adopt a stage name, he simply reversed his first and middle names, adding a meaningless initial 'K' in order to distinguish himself from another George Arthur. He made his professional debut as a spear-carrier in a production at the Memorial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon, and soon was playing minor parts in Benson's West End Shakespearian productions.\n\nLearning that American film director Harold M. Shaw was in London planning a cinematic adaptation of the novel \"Kipps\" by H.G. Wells, Arthur, with characteristic brashness and skillful self-promotion, managed to persuade Shaw that he was perfect for the title role - as indeed he was. Even before its release it was apparent to all that the film would be a hit, and Arthur found himself in demand as a film actor, and in a position to hobnob with visiting celebrities like Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.\n\nThe success of Kipps (1921) led to two films with visiting American star Mae Marsh and dreams of Hollywood. Leaving behind a newly-acquired wife (Milba Lloyd, later employed by Cecil B. DeMille in his art department), Arthur sailed to America and was received with profound indifference by American film makers. Arthur turned to Chaplin for help, and the latter found him a role in a John Gilbert film at Fox. Arthur was then able to persuade director James Cruze to give him a prominent part in his all-star production of Hollywood (1923), today one of the most eagerly sought-after 'lost' films of the silent era.\n\nA five-year contract with producer Pat Powers in his pocket, Arthur was convinced that he was firmly established in Hollywood as a light comedian / juvenile, and brought the rest of his family over from England. Within a few months Powers's venture collapsed, and Arthur was reduced to operating a grocery store and remodelling houses to eke out a living. Having long nurtured plans of producing a film of his own, he managed to bluff his way into obtaining sufficient money to finance an ultra-low budget production. He turned to would-be director Josef von Sternberg to helm the film, and with a script by the latter and a largely non-professional cast, Die Heilsj√§ger (1925) was made. Arthur screened the film for Chaplin, who showed it to Pickford and Fairbanks, and it was decided that United Artists would distribute it. A critical success, Sternberg's career was launched, and Arthur obtained a contract with MGM.\n\nArthur now enjoyed his best days as a film actor. Separated from his first wife, he romanced Ren√©e Ador√©e and Jean Arthur, and was a frequent visitor to San Simeon. MGM paired Arthur with Karl Dane in a very successful series of light comedies, which ended when the advent of sound revealed Dane's thick accent. The team was able to keep going for a while in vaudeville and short films for RKO and Paramount, and Arthur tried his hand as a singer / composer and novelist, but by 1933 he was pretty much desperate for work. He was able to obtain bit parts at MGM, but focussed his attention on a new career as theatrical producer. He opened a short-lived Grand Guignol theatre in Hollywood, followed by a much more ambitious venture in partnership with E.E. Clive, but after a final film appearance in Vanessa, Her Love Story (1935), he wound up working as a film salesman in Michigan, and then as a theatrical reviewer on Station WQXR. He also published a not-very-successful magazine guide to New York theatre and night life.\n\nFollowing Pearl Harbor, Arthur, now a US citizen, joined the Air Force as a private. Shortly before being shipped overseas, he married again. He spent the war years organising shows for the troops.\n\nOn his return Arthur tried to revive his magazine, with little success. Once again he reinvented himself, this time as a producer and distributor of short films for television. This provided him with a comfortable living into the 1960s."
