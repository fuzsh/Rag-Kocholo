        "text": "Columbia University Press was fortunate to have published one of David Bordwell’s first books, The Classical Hollywood Cinema: Film Style and Mode of Production, co-written with Janet Staiger and Kristin Thompson in 1985, and his most recent, Perplexing Plots: Popular Storytelling and the Poetics of Murder. We join his many students, readers, colleagues, and admirers in the the film world, in mourning his death and celebrating his rich legacy.\n\nFor more on David Bordwell, read Kristin Thompson’s post “Gone but far from forgotten.”\n\nFounded in 2000, and becoming an imprint of Columbia University Press in 2011, Wallflower publishes intellectually rigorous works for film scholars, students, and cinephiles.\n\nIn addition to a wide range of stand-alone titles from across the spectrum of contemporary world cinema studies, the series listed below are pillars of the Wallflower list.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Short Cuts series is a comprehensive library of introductory texts covering the full spectrum of film studies. With concise discussion of contemporary issues within historical and cultural contexts and the extensive use of illustrative case studies, this list of study guides is perfectly suited to building an individually styled library for all students and enthusiasts of cinema and popular culture.\n\nThe Directors’ Cuts series focuses on the work of many of the most significant contemporary international filmmakers. In considering the production and reception of the most important works of directors – from Clint Eastwood and the Coen Brothers to Agnès Varda and Béla Tarr, and all points between – this series sheds light upon the creative dynamics of world cinema.\n\nCinematic Guerrillas: A Conversation With Jie Li\n\nLong before provisionally becoming the most important film market in the world, much of China’s territory lacked the infrastructure necessary to develop a sustainable film-exhibition network. Despite the lack of electricity in rural areas in the mid–twentieth century, the newly established socialist state spared no effort in bringing cinema to even the most remote of its villages. For that, it created a low-tech propaganda network for distributing films, one that relied on the hard work of itinerant projectionists, who would carry equipment to electrify villages both literally—with the aid of generators—and figuratively, bringing to Chinese communities the “light” of Mao Zedong’s leadership.\n\nRead More\n\nBook Excerpt from Death by Laughter: “Gaslighting the libido”\n\nIn the spirit of imagining hysteria as a misalignment of laughter, I’d like to turn to Esther Wakefield, an unknown woman from Chicago whose pageantry of uproarious symptoms reportedly gave “a black eye to science” and left the country’s medical physicians “all at sea” in 1899.\n\nRead More\n\nBook Excerpt from Perplexing Plots: \"Holmes and Watson in Manhattan:\" Musing on the Creation of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin\n\nRex Stout began writing before Hammett, Chandler, and Gardner did. Between 1912 and 1917, he published more than thirty stories and four novels, most in pulp magazines. At age twenty-seven, Stout gave up writing to run a company that arranged for schoolchildren to set up savings accounts. The earnings from this business enabled him to move to Europe and launch a second writing career.\n\nRead More\n\nA Man of Genius Has Been Seldom Ruined But By Himself: Ethan Warren’s The Cinema of Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nWhen he was seven, Paul Thomas Anderson wrote in his diary, “I want to be a writer, producer, director, special effects man. I know how to do everything and I know everything” (p. 1). For this millennial wunderkind, it would seem his pre-adolescent gall was not mere lip service but foretelling. Anderson directed three star-studded films before turning thirty; his frequent collaborator, Daniel Day-Lewis, is one of the most renowned contemporary actors; and, at the time of this writing, Anderson is rumoured to be working on several projects, including a possible adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland.\n\nRead More\n\nFilm and Culture publishes a wide range of books that explore the history, aesthetics, industrial practices, and technologies of film from around the world. Books in the series mix archival research with critical readings and approaches to individual films and the works of filmmakers.\n\nVisible Evidence publishes books that reexamine the global history of documentary media as well investigating the challenges and opportunities for documentary media in the twenty-first century. Books will consider global documentary media and its relationship to digital filmmaking, history and historiography, activism and social movements, political trauma, and climate change.\n\nWinner, 2023 Lewis Mumford Award for Outstanding Scholarship in the Ecology of Technics, Media Ecology Association\n\nAt a time when digital platforms continue to encroach on everyday life, The Immersive Enclosure takes a critical look at these attempts to jettison existing social realities and offers a bold new approach for understanding the media environments to come.\n\nIf you would like to submit a book to Columbia University Press, please send a proposal containing a brief description of the content and focus of the book, a table of contents or chapter outline, a literature review and market analysis, and professional information about the author, including previous publications.\n\nFloating Opera Press is a Berlin-based publisher of contemporary criticism as well as select artists’ books. It aims to make new demands on critical inquiry into culture and politics and to publish underrepresented or historically silenced writers and artists. In this vein, Floating Opera Press launched the Critic’s Essay Series in 2021. The series gives voice to authors who subvert or replace normative modes of thinking through our cultural and political moment.\n\nTulika Books is a small independent publishing house based in New Delhi, India. Publishing since 1995 from a broad left and democratic perspective, its list comprises primarily scholarly/academic books in the arts, humanities and social sciences. Tulika Books brings out between 10 to 15 new titles every year, besides reprints and revised/updated editions of previously published titles. Archaeology, architecture, art, critical theory, cultural studies, development studies, economics, film studies, history, literary theory, politics, philosophy and sociology are among the subject areas it specializes in. The authors published by Tulika Books include some of India’s best known academics and intellectuals."
