        "text": "BBC Culture polled film critics from around the world to determine the best American movies ever made. The results are surprising – Gone With the Wind appears at 97.\n\nAmerica’s films are among its greatest exports. Since Thomas Edison’s innovations in the medium in the 1890s, the United States has consistently been a powerhouse in the development of cinema – from the massively popular entertainments of Hollywood to independent and avant-garde film. In recognition of the astounding influence of the US on what remains the most popular art-form worldwide, BBC Culture has polled 62 international film critics to determine the 100 greatest American films of all time.\n\nThis is a national film tradition that has influenced film-making worldwide, so we felt it was important, also, to get a global perspective on American film: the critics we polled live and work all over the world, from the United Kingdom and continental Europe to South America, Australia, India and the Middle East – and of course the United States as well. Previous film polls conducted by other publications or organisations either haven’t looked solely at American film or have drawn their poll contributors from within the US film industry, not necessarily relying just on the opinion of critics. Some of the critics we invited to participate are film reviewers at newspapers or magazines, others are broadcasters and some write books.\n\nWhat defines an American film? For the purposes of this poll, it is any movie that received funding from a US source. The directors of these films did not have to be born in the United States – in fact, 32 films on the list were directed by film-makers born elsewhere – nor did the films even have to be shot in the US. Each critic who participated submitted a list of 10 films, with their pick for the greatest film receiving 10 points and their number 10 pick receiving one point. The points were added up to produce the final list. Critics were encouraged to submit lists of the 10 films they feel, on an emotional level, are the greatest in American cinema – not necessarily the most important, just the best. These are the results.\n\nThe 100 greatest American films\n\n100. Ace in the Hole (Billy Wilder, 1951)\n\n99. 12 Years a Slave (Steve McQueen, 2013)\n\n98. Heaven’s Gate (Michael Cimino, 1980)\n\n97.
