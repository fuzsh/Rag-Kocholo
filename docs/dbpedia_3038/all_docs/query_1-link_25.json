        "text": "Midway through the movie “Babe,” Ferdinand, the panicky, wise-talking duck, reaches his breaking point. A shrewd bird, he has discerned that the Hoggetts, his owners, keep farm animals around only if they are gainfully employed, but all of his efforts to find a job have failed. Egg-making was a non-starter. “I tried it with the hens,” he says. “It didn’t work.” His second scheme—usurping the rooster and squawking out a reveille every morning—was briefly successful, until Mrs. Hoggett bought an alarm clock. The only role left for him, Ferdinand fears, is as Christmas canard à l’orange. “Dinner means death!” he wails. “Christmas means carnage!” In the end, Farmer Hoggett slaughters a duck named Rosanna instead. But the fix seems to be in, and Ferdinand decides to flee the farm. His parting words to Babe, the piglet hero of the film, sound like something out of “Paradise Lost.” “There must be kinder dispositions in far-off, gentler lands,” he says. Then off he flaps.\n\nKinder dispositions seem to be in short supply just now, which may explain the sense of cheer that permeated David Geffen Hall last Friday, when the New York Philharmonic put on a screening of “Babe.” The film was released in 1995, when I was seven years old, and I had forgotten how nimbly it jumps from darkness to light and back again. The script is based on “The Sheep-Pig,” a children’s book by Dick King-Smith, and was adapted for the screen by Chris Noonan, the film’s director, and George Miller, its producer. Within the first minute, the piglet sees his mother cattle-prodded off to her death and replaced with a milk-dispensing machine. (No wonder James Cromwell, the actor who portrayed Hoggett, became a vegan afterward.) But soon Babe is adopted by the sheepdogs on the farm, Rex and Fly and their puppies, and he begins, improbably, to learn the art of herding. By the end, the movie becomes an irresistible ode to mutual understanding.\n\nI had forgotten, too, how elegantly “Babe” is supported by its soundtrack. Friday’s performance was conducted by the Australian composer Nigel Westlake, who wrote the film’s score, more than two decades ago, and recently reworked it. The Philharmonic, like other big ensembles around the world, mounts these screenings with some regularity, in part because they have a way of luring in new audiences. “Most people only hear classical music coming out the cardboard diaphragm of a speaker in their home cinema,” Westlake told me in late November. The screenings, he said, are a way of “cross-pollinating and diversifying.” At David Geffen Hall, fully a quarter of the crowd appeared to be children under the age of ten. “You want to take a couple home?” the father next to me asked.\n\nWestlake said that he got the “Babe” assignment when he was still “a bit of a rookie,” having written primarily for radio, TV, IMAX, and the circus. He was the second composer whom Noonan and Miller had tried. The first, a Hollywood veteran named Jerry Goldsmith, had produced a partial score, but it didn’t fit the film. “It was just too pretty, too sentimental,” Miller told me earlier this month. “We needed something with a little bit more weight about it.” Noonan and the editors had put together a temporary soundtrack, which included some well-known pieces from the classical repertoire, and it became Westlake’s job to meld them with his own work. “At the time, I kind of cringed,” he said. “Pillaging the classics for profit is not a good look.” But Noonan, by his own admission, was “pretty insistent,” and Westlake relented. Miller observed that something similar happened with “2001: A Space Odyssey” when Stanley Kubrick rejected Alex North’s original music in favor of the two Strausses, Richard and Johann. “Often people become addicted to the temp score,” he said.\n\nMusical quotations are scattered throughout the film like Easter eggs. When Ferdinand conscripts the pig to go into the house and steal the alarm clock, the tiptoeing music that accompanies the scene is Léo Delibes’s “Pizzicato Polka.” When Babe witnesses his first act of sheepdogging, watching as Rex and Fly glide fluidly around the bleating herd, it is to the waltzing rhythm of Edvard Grieg’s “Spring Dance.” And when, in one of the movie’s most affecting scenes, Hoggett watches TV while Fly and Babe sleep in front of the fire, safe from the tempest raging outside, the song that makes him tear up is Gabriel Fauré’s “Cantique de Jean Racine.” Westlake’s original material, which accounts for the majority of the score, is skillfully restrained, though there are moments when it, too, tugs at the ears, as in the sombre duet between violin and bassoon that plays when Fly’s pups are sold off to the neighbors, or the demented rendition of “Jingle Bells” that accompanies the arrival of the Hoggetts’ bratty, citified grandchildren. If you consider the world from an animal’s perspective, as “Babe” asks you to do, and if Christmas for animals means carnage, why shouldn’t a carol sound totally crackers?\n\nThe melody that ties “Babe” together is part pop, part classical, part Westlake. You may know it from the film’s euphoric penultimate scene, in which Hoggett sings and dances for the sick pig to get him to eat again, but it was originally written by the nineteenth-century French composer Camille Saint-Saëns. His third symphony, the so-called Organ Symphony, is sometimes derided as a potboiler, but I submit that there are few joy-delivery systems better than the piece’s finale. The minutes that lead up to it are turbulent and brutal, and the oboe emerges from them with an apprehensive solo, answered sweetly by the woodwinds. There is a moment of silence, and then the organ hits you, right in the solar plexus, with a chord of Gothic proportions. After several measures of throat-clearing, the music resolves into a happy emulsion, the organ humming along beneath the main theme in the strings while a piano tinkles prettily above.\n\nIt was this theme that the composer Jonathan Hodge, best known in his native Britain for having written the jingle for a cleaning product called Shake ’n’ Vac, adapted into “If I Had Words,” the love song that Hoggett sings to Babe. The original recording, which reached No. 3 on the U.K. charts in 1978, is a perfect cultural artifact—set to a reggae groove, backed by a choir of English schoolchildren, and filled with New Age-y promises. (“If I had words to make a day for you, / I’d sing you a morning golden and new.”) When I asked Miller about the song, he said, “It was as if it were written for this movie. Here’s a farmer who speaks very few words and a pig who can’t speak to humans, and yet there’s some connection between them.” Still, he and Noonan wondered whether it was too cheesy to use. Eighteen months before they shot the singing scene, they remained uncommitted; they decided to “let it be Darwinian,” Miller said.\n\nBut “If I Had Words” stuck, and Westlake worked the Saint-Saëns melody in throughout the score, reorchestrating it to suit the gentle nature of the film and its characters. “Babe” was shot in the Shire of Wingecarribee, a highland idyll in southeastern Australia, and the first appearance of the theme is suitably serene, played on celesta, the same instrument that Tchaikovsky chose for his Sugar Plum Fairy. It crops up again at key emotional moments, as when the pig asks Fly whether he can call her Mom, or when he herds his first sheep past a gawping Hoggett. When the tune returns in the singing scene, Westlake adds a penny whistle and a frame drum—“preferably of Celtic folk origin,” the score notes—for a flavor of Riverdance. There is no organ, but the joy is the same.\n\nIn the final act of “Babe,” all the Chekhov’s guns go off. Hoggett uses his befuddling Christmas present, a fax machine, to enter Babe into the national sheepdog trials. The gruff alpha dog Rex, lately muzzled because of his aggression, sweet-talks the sheep into giving him the password that Babe needs to compete. (I happened to see the movie for the first time in France, where the password wasn’t “Baa, ram, ewe” but “Bleat, faithful herd.”) But the best callback involves Hoggett’s fogeyish devotion to making gates close quietly. Earlier in the movie, after the farm gate clangs open too loudly for his taste, he designs an intricate mechanism to shut it up. At the end of the trials, when Babe ushers his sheep into the final holding pen three by three, Hoggett pivots the gate creakingly, groaningly toward the latch. There’s a split second of total silence, then a satisfying click, and the spectators go wild. Babe earns a 10.0 from all five judges, and it is right then that Westlake brings back the Saint-Saëns theme, richly and triumphantly orchestrated. The movie ends, of course, with the immortal “That’ll do, pig,” and with Hoggett and Babe gazing beatifically at each other. But the Philharmonic’s performance might just as well have ended a few moments earlier, with a cutaway to the prodigal Ferdinand back on the farm. “The pig did it! The pig did it!” he cheers. “Got the perfect score!”"
