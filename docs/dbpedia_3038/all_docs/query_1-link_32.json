        "text": "May 30, 2018\n\nThe Pig is difficult to classify.\n\nIt's non-fiction, erudite but creatively interpreted, with footnotes, lots of footnotes, so many that a page without them is a surprise and a page only of them ought to have been allowed by the publisher. Hebrew slips between two teeth, German and Latin between the other, Greek likes it on the tongue to roll about with French.\n\nThe first page has a black and white reproduction of Pornokratès or The Lady with the Pig by Félicien Rops (1878).\n\nAny frivolity you may anticipate will drain from your mind after the first few footnotes; any flagrant immorality or irreligiousness might be flagrant to an astute mind willing to brave said footnotes full of quotes in their original languages—the translator left them wonderfully untouched.\n\nThe introductory chapter by the translator is aptly named Porco-Analysis, but is hard to make much of initially. Though you do understand fairly quickly that The Pig is the Sun is the thesis of the book and what follows is a proof by thorough analysis of myth.\n\nYou really can't get far without reading the footnotes. Occasionally sentences (All this made the Pig the paragon of Power, Fearsomeness, Courage, and untameable Desire) will confirm the thesis explicitly, then there'll be more footnotes.\n\nIn the Taittiriya Brâhmana, the Wild Boar guards the treasure of the demons (the stolen Winter Sun), which is locked away in seven mountains (the months of Winter); Indra slays the Boar and discovers the treasure (the Spring Sun) (ibid., 345.).*\n\nProof abounds for viewing the Boar as the principle of Fertility, Springtide, and the Venal Sun.\n\n(p. 15)\n\nThe excerpts and connections are fun.\n\nThere's also a nonstandard version of Cinderella, who instead having to complete the impossible task of sorting lentils before being allowed to go to the ball, must “eat an immeasurable quantity of apples”.\n\nNow, instead of summoning pigeons, she calls on “a veritable legion of Piglets, which consume the apples in her stead” (Gubernatis, 342).\n\n(p. 16)\n\nThe Edda naturally gets a looking into: we are reminded that the Boar pulls Freyr’s Sun Chariot and in Skaldic Poetry, Freyr himself occasionally rides upon the Boar. In the Younger Edda, the Boar is vaunted further: he has the ability to run through air and water, unstoppably, and his bristle shine through the thickest darkness. Indeed,\n\nIn his Lexicon mythologiae (1828), Finn Magnusen calls him the immediate representative of the Sun: pro solis ipsius idolo sive simulacro.\n\n(p. 35)\n\nYou might be scandalised:\n\nOne almost wishes to congratulate the Jews on the choice they made. Indeed, because they continue to observe the prohibition of consuming Pork, this spared them from eating their own God.*\n\n(p. 64)\n\nThe star at the end of this quote leads to a footnote curious in itself.\n\n*”Would, indeed, anyone be so mad as to declare something his God and, at the same time, eat it?” asked Cicero in De nature deorum, III, 16—hardly suspecting, or course, that one hundred years alter his question would prove altogether timely.\n\n(Marcus Tullius Cicero lived in the first century before Christ.)\n\nIn the end, a hundred pages later, it's still an odd book, but one that's enjoyable for its depth and erudition. And if you like pigs, this is the book for you. Pig as solar deity? Well, why not?"
