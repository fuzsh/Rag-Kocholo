        "text": "I wrote the score and made the sound design for Josh Gibson’s Pig Film, which received its world premiere at the 2018 Edinburgh Film Festival and its US premiere at the New Orleans Film Festival the same year. Called by one reviewer an “hour-long, black & white sci-fi musical”, Pig Film stars actress and soprano Julianna Tauschinger-Dempsey. Josh writes of the story:\n\nIn an empty world, a solitary female mechanically follows the protocols of a factory hog farm. Her labors are sporadically punctuated by musical rhapsodies as she moves toward the impending end. Is it the end of the world, a program malfunction, or the beginning of a film?\n\nBelow are eight excerpts from the film featuring the songs and electronic interludes. Josh and I co-wrote the song texts, which derive entirely from historical ephemera of the hog farming and pork industries: film scripts, sales spiels, manuals, television commercials, etc."
