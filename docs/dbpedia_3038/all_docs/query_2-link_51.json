        "text": "On a bucolic farm in Upstate New York, a farmer is in crisis: after years of raising pigs, he can no longer bear the ultimate act of betrayal. Unable to ignore his ethical impasse, and with 250 pigs on the farm, he sets out to change his life.\n\nStunning cinematography captures the final year of a small-scale farmer and the pigs under his care. Deeply immersive, THE LAST PIG is a poetic snapshot, a contemplation on compassion, ethics, and the changing landscape of animal agriculture. The farmer’s inner reflections share his struggle to align life with values, and through the story’s simple intimacy, his moral quandary quietly becomes our own.\n\nWith bittersweet detail, this award-winning film offers an entirely new view of small-scale livestock farming and raises crucial questions about the ethics of eating.\n\nBob Comis, the main character of THE LAST PIG, chronicled his day-to-day life as a pig farmer for over 10 years. His work has been published online and can be read at: https://www.huffpost.com/author/bob-comis.\n\n“For the first few decades of my life, I was oblivious to the suffering of non-human (and human) animals. Thanks to the courage and bravery of undercover investigators who secretly capture and share footage of the twin horrors of factory farming and industrial slaughter, I was roused from my ignorance. I became a vegan, but quickly failed. In search of an alternative to factory-farmed meat, I became a humane pig farmer—and quickly succeeded.\n\n​\n\nI raised pigs for slaughter for ten years, until a powerful sense of empathy and compassion propelled me to change the course of my life. I decided to quit pig farming, start a vegetable farm, and become a vegetarian (vegan, in 2015).\n\n​\n\n​Today, when I pull a beet out of the ground, or unearth a brilliant cluster of potatoes, I am able to be fully present, which is very much the opposite of my experience when I farmed pigs, which I did from a distance, divorced from the moment, disconnected from myself.”\n\nFinding the story: A few years ago, I read an essay titled “Happy Pigs Make Happy Meat?”– written by a pig farmer. By the time I’d finished reading, I was in tears. I mustered the courage to contact the farmer, and we talked on the phone for an hour. I asked if he’d consider a documentary, and despite his reservations, he agreed to let me visit his farm with my friend and cinematographer, Joe Brunette. We made the 4 hour trip to his farm in Upstate New York, not knowing whether Bob would consider letting us film. After talking for hours, he said yes! For Bob to allow us to tell his story was a huge leap of faith.\n\n​\n\nThe filming process: We started filming right away, since we’d miss the story if we took time to search for funding. We shot for nine months, through the seasons, for one week each month. In the field, it was just Bob, Joe, me, the pigs, and Monk, Bob’s beloved dog. Our two-person crew gave us an intimacy which I think is reflected in the film.\n\n​\n\nAlthough we filmed on-camera interviews, in the edit I decided to almost exclusively use Bob's voice. Seeing him speak on camera seemed to break the intimacy. I wanted the viewer to slip into Bob’s subconscious and become an intimate part of his journey.\n\nI believe Bob's willingness to share his human imperfections makes his story all the more powerful. I hope his transparency will inspire others to consider their own truth and to live that truth more completely—even if it means turning their life upside down.\n\nWhy I wanted to make this film: I've been making documentaries on issues about justice, animals, and conservation for the past 30 years. When I read Bob Comis' essay, I knew his incredible story had to be shared. For much of our society, there's a huge disconnect between what we eat and the source of that food. Who better to help explore that disconnect, and inspire compassion for ALL beings, than a farmer experiencing his own evolution of thought? Through its intimacy, this story has the power to reach an audience that might not have contemplated these issues.\n\nWhy Bob wasn’t able to create a sanctuary for the last pigs: There were multiple reasons why Bob wasn't able to create a sanctuary for the last of the pigs. The land was not his—it was leased from neighbors—and all of Bob’s money was tied up in the farm.\n\n​\n\nBob also knows his limitations. He's gifted at caring for animals, but keeping a sanctuary afloat requires skills he doesn’t possess (such as fundraising and management). He recently shared with me that he misses the pigs terribly and is still haunted by their ghosts.\n\nQ: How did you finance the film?\n\nA: The Last Pig has been a labor of love, financed through crowdfunding, a few small grants and work without pay on the part of the filmmakers.

In almost all cases, the animals are never allowed outside. Because these confined conditions are so unhealthy for the animals, they are fed antibiotics to keep them alive until they are slaughtered."
