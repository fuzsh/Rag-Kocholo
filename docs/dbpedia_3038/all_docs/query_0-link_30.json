        "text": "‘The Three Pigs’ story is a tale all kids should know as it stresses a valuable lesson of life, i.e. hard work in the right direction will bear positive results. Although brothers, the three pigs possess different personalities, which comes across through the narrative as they set out to live their lives by themselves. Read the full story of ‘The Three Pigs’ in English to your child and teach them the value of smart+hard work in the long run.\n\nOrigin And History Of The Story\n\n‘The Three Pigs’ story has been a part of everyone’s childhood memories, and its various versions have been passed down from generation to generation. The earliest source is believed to be ‘The English Fairy Tales’ by Joseph Jacobs around 19 century.\n\nStory Type Of ‘The Three Pigs’\n\nThis story is a fairy tale and can be narrated to kids at bedtime. A picture book of this story makes for a great visual experience for kids.\n\nStory Characters\n\nThe story revolves around three pigs, but we also have an antagonist, the wolf, who symbolises life’s challenges, negativity, and hardships. Every character has its trait. The first two pigs showcase the shortcomings of lazy behaviour and an ‘I don’t care’ attitude. In contrast, the third pig establishes the positive side of being a hard worker and a planner in life.\n\nThe Story Of ‘The Three Pigs’ For Children\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived an old mother pig. She had three little pigs. One day she decided to send them on their way to lead their lives on their own. “Go and seek your own destiny and fortune” the mother said, and the little pigs went their ways.\n\nThe first pig was very lazy. “I’ll build my house with straws”, he decided as he chose the easy way. He got the straw from a farmer and started building.\n\nThe second pig said “I will make my house with sticks.” He got the sticks from a woodcutter and began building.\n\nThe third pig was laborious and intelligent. “I will make my house using bricks” he said, and got the materials from a builder pushing a cart of bricks.\n\n“Your materials seem weak, and your house won’t be strong”, said the little pic to his brothers, as he was concerned that their construction would not be sturdy enough. He said, “Listen, brothers, we should make a strong house, which can save us from any danger.”\n\nThe other two pigs said, “You do it your way, and we will make our houses our way. Anyways, those bricks look very heavy. So much labour and so much work – not for us. You continue.”\n\nThey ignored his advice and constructed their houses the way they wanted.\n\nSoon, all three pigs built their houses and were pleased about it.\n\nAfter some time, a wolf passed the lane of these pigs’ houses. He saw the house made up of straws and a pig playing nearby. The wolf decided to him. The moment the pig saw the wolf, he ran inside the house in fear. Then, the wolf knocked on the door and said, “Little pig! Little pig! Won’t you let me in?”\n\nBut, the pig refused and replied, “No! No! No! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!”\n\nThen the wolf grinned and said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”\n\nHe did what he said, and he blew the house away. Seeing this, the first pig ran towards the second pig’s house to hide.\n\nThe wolf followed him along and found the second pig’s house.\n\nHe knocked on the door again and said, “Little pigs! Little pigs! Won’t you let me in?”\n\nAfter seeing the scary teeth of the wolf, both the pigs replied, “No! No! No! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chin!”\n\nThen again, the wolf laughed in satire and said, “Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” And he did just that.\n\nRealising what was happening, both the pigs escaped to the third pig’s house.\n\nThe wolf followed them and reached the third pig house.\n\nNow, the wolf knocked on the door again and said, ‘Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!’\n\nBut the frightened pigs answered back, ‘No! No! No! Not by the hair on our chinny chin chin!’\n\nThen the wolf laughed cunningly and threatened, ‘Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.’\n\nThe big bad wolf tried to bring the house down and huff and puff again and again, but it was of no use. The frustrated wolf attempted to make a forceful entry from the chimney, but the intelligent third pig boiled a large pot of water and placed it below the chimney. The wolf fell inside the pot, hurt himself, and ran away in a jiffy. The three pigs were overjoyed!\n\nThe other two pigs praised the third pig for his hard work, practicality and intelligence.\n\nStory Summary\n\nGiven below is the summary of the story.\n\nIn the story, three little pigs are sent off by their mother into the world to live their lives on their own. In the pursuit of the same, each pig builds a house. The first pig builds a house of straw, the second decides to construct a house of sticks, and the third builds one with bricks. One day, a big bad wolf spots the pigs. He chases them to their houses and asks each pig to let him inside. The pigs, knowing he will eat each of them, do not let him in, saying, ‘Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin.’ The wolf threatens, saying, ‘Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.’ The wolf quickly brings the homes made of straw and sticks down, but it becomes impossible to blow down the sturdy brick house built by the third pig. The wolf then climbs down the chimney but ends up in a large pot of hot water. He quickly jumps out of the pot runs away, never to return, and the three pigs are saved.\n\nMoral Of The Story\n\n‘Perseverance and hard work pay off in the end.’\n\nThe story highlights the importance of intelligent and practical hard work in life, as it will definitely pay off in the coming years. The first two pigs were reluctant to do the hard work and chose an easy way to build their houses, and these houses couldn’t protect them in the face of danger. But the third pig, who didn’t shy away from the hard work, made a solid house that could protect him and his brothers in the end.\n\nHow Can Children Apply The Moral Lesson Of The Story In Their Real Life?\n\nKids need to understand that lazy behaviour will not help them yield good results in the long run. They should work hard towards their goal and learn to plan strategically for more impact and success. Farsightedness is a skill that needs to be cultivated in kids with time. The third pig knew that a house made of bricks would be stronger, durable, and could protect him from any danger or unpredictable situation, and it did.\n\nStories are a great way to teach some great moral values to kids. Stories like ‘The Three Pigs’ are essential to inculcate the importance of hard work in kids. With this story, they will understand that shortcuts may satisfy them in the short run, but in the long run, lead to problems and challenges in life, but intelligent and consistent hard work will take them towards the path of success and help them make better decisions in life."
