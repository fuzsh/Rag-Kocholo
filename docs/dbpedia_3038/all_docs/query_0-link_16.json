        "text": "See also: PIG and Pig\n\nEnglish Wikipedia has an article on:\n\nWikipedia\n\nWikispecies has information on:\n\nWikispecies\n\nFrom Middle English pigge (“pig, pigling”) (originally a term for a young pig, with adult pigs being swyn), apparently from Old English *picga (attested only in compounds, such as picgbrēad (“mast, pig-fodder”)), from Proto-West Germanic *piggō, *puggō (“piglet”). Compare Middle Dutch pogge, puggen, pigge, pegsken (“pigling”), Middle Low German pugge, pûke (“piglet”). Pokorny suggests this root might be somehow related to *bū-, *bew- (“to blow; swell”), which could account for the alternation between \"pig\" and \"big\".\n\nA connection to early modern Dutch bigge (contemporary big (“piglet”)), West Frisian bigge (“pigling”), and similar terms in Middle Low German is sometimes proposed, \"but the phonology is difficult\".[1] Some sources say the words are \"almost certainly not\" related,[2] others consider a relation \"probable, but not certain\".[3]\n\nThe slang sense of \"police officer\" is attested since at least 1785.[4]\n\nIPA(key): /ˈpɪɡ/\n\nAudio (US):\n\nAudio (General Australian):\n\nAudio (UK):\n\nRhymes: -ɪɡ\n\npig (countable and uncountable, plural pigs)\n\nAny of several mammalian species of the genus Sus, having cloven hooves, bristles and a nose adapted for digging; especially the domesticated animal Sus domesticus.\n\nsee Thesaurus:pig\n\nThe man kept a pen with two pigs that he fed everything from carrots to cabbage.\n\n1855, Charles Kingsley, “How Salvation Yeo Slew the King of the Gubbings”, in Westward Ho!: Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight,[…], volume II, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire: Macmillan & Co., →OCLC, page 113:\n\n[…] and at the back a rambling courtledge of barns and walls, around which pigs and bare-foot children grunted in loving communion of dirt.\n\n(specifically) A young swine, a piglet (contrasted with a hog, an adult swine).\n\n2005 April, Live Swine from Canada, Investigation No. 731-TA-1076 (Final), publication 3766, April 2005, U.S. International Trade Commission, →ISBN, page I-9:\n\nWeanlings grow into feeder pigs, and feeder pigs grow into slaughter hogs.

Those in front resumed their taunts of “Pig, pig, fascist pig,” and “pigs eat shit, pigs eat shit.” The rest of the crowd, however, backed off and sat down on the grass when reinforcements arrived.
