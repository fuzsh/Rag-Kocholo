It manages to skillfully ask questions about the nature of reality, memory, and dream while speculating on what may become of our addiction to incarcerating our fellow brothers and sisters. The result is the best kind of intellectual head trip.” — SERGIO DE LA PAVA, AUTHOR OF A NAKED SINGULARITY AND LOST EMPRESS\n\nIt’s been seven years since Gloomy Knob landed in the Ted Stevens High-Security Federal Penitentiary and five years since the end of the war, the one North Korea started when they sent a missile to Cold Storage, Alaska. Serving a life sentence for the murder of his sister, Gloomy spends his time trying to forget about the past.\n\nThen one day, an old family friend grabs Gloomy from his off-site work station and smuggles him away in a hollow tree trunk. Instead of celebrating his newfound freedom, Gloomy finds himself coming unmoored—he feels he belongs in prison for the unspeakable wrongs he has committed. But his kidnappers believe Gloomy knows where a second nuclear warhead is hidden and demand to know where it is before it detonates. The clock is ticking . . ."
