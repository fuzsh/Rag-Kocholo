        "text": "Deliberate, active listening is hugely important for learning the Chinese language (or any language!). However, binge-watching Chinese shows can help you improve your 语感 or “sense of the language”. What do I recommend? Well, Peppa Pig Mandarin Chinese dub. =P\n\nI actually enjoy watching Peppa Pig with my daughter, even though I’ve watched many of the episodes many times. Don’t force yourself if Peppa Pig isn’t your thing. There are plenty of other Chinese shows around (feel free to share your recommendation!).\n\nI think Peppa Pig is simple, practical and fun, so I hope you can start here! Don’t underestimate children’s shows!!\n\nI don’t know if anybody else has studied these videos as much as I have by now. Some days I feel like I can write a couple research papers on Peppa Pig.\n\nSo I thought I should share with you how to navigate the official Chinese Peppa Pig channel and recommend a few videos with my comments.\n\nWhere can I find Peppa Pig Mandarin Chinese Dub?\n\nPeppa Pig Mandarin Dub has an official YouTube channel: 小猪佩奇 中文官方 – Peppa Pig. (Please try to support the creators by avoiding any other users’ uploads!)\n\nOn the channel, most videos are about one hour long. That is by design because the channel is geared towards young children, and it is recommended that children don’t watch videos for too long, usually not longer than one hour.\n\nThese one hour videos are perfect for binge-watching and getting some passive listening practice in.\n\nIn particular, these videos on YouTube don’t have Chinese or English subtitles. (I heard Netflix does have the subtitles.) Even if you can find subtitles, of if one day the channel or YouTube adds subtitles, I recommend that you avoid them! Subtitles take away the listening comprehension practice.\n\nWhich videos should I watch for practicing passive listening in Chinese?\n\nThere are so many videos!! Which ones are worth watching? They are all good. But I have a few general tips.\n\nTip #1: Go for 全集合集 or full-length episodes\n\nThis is my most important tip.\n\nIf you pay attention to the titles, you’d notice they usually have either “全集合集” or “精选合集” in the title.\n\nI would highly recommend you go for “全集合集” rather than “精选合集”. Since the former are collections of full length episodes, while while the latter are only collections of highlights.\n\nNote that they have a playlist called “全集合集” but the playlist is actually a combination of both collections of full-length episodes and highlights. False advertising!!\n\nSince I’m advocating for learning Chinese through contexts, I believe it’s way better to watch full episodes with complete stories (unless you’re doing deep dive repeats on Kong Long Mandarin. Even then, I try to include small self-contained scenarios in my segments.)\n\nTip #2: Don’t care about the order of the episodes\n\nWithin each forty-minute to hour-long video, there are nine or fourteen episodes of Peppa Pig, each about five minute long.\n\nThe order of these episodes don’t necessarily follow the order of broadcasting. It doesn’t matter, because the episodes can be watched independently, there is no particular orders to follow.\n\n(Similarly, I strive to make each post on Learn Chinese with Peppa Pig independent of each other, so one doesn’t have to follow a particular order when they’re going through the posts.)\n\nOccasionally new characters get introduced. So you may have the urge to try to watch the intro episodes first. Well, it’s not critical! You will be able to figure out who they are. Almost all the characters are kids in Peppa or George’s daycare and their relatives.\n\nThis isn’t a mystery drama. You will be okay.\n\nTip #3: Repeat just a few of the hour long videos as much as possible\n\nEven if you’re binge-watching, I highly recommend you watch just a few repeatedly in order to reap the benefits of repeats. Repeats are so incredibly important!!\n\nChildren love repeats and that’s how they acquire the language! It’s the same for everybody else.\n\nEvery time you repeat something you’ve watched or listened to before, you will consolidate what you’ve learned, and learn a few more things! I promise.\n\nIf you want to binge-watch, start with a few collections from Season one!\n\nThe reason why I started with season one is simply because that’s what I started watching with my daughter and I started writing show notes for season one. If I make it to the later seasons, I will certainly write about them!\n\nGuide to Peppa Pig Mandarin Chinese Dub Season One\n\nHere I’ve included all the collections of full-length episodes from season one that I found on the YouTube channel. There are overlapping episodes in these videos.\n\nIf you’ve been doing Chinese practice here at Kong Long Mandarin. You’re no strangers to the episodes in this video!\n\nEpisodes included in this collection: (As you can tell right away, some of these episodes are not actually from the first nine episodes as the title of the video suggests. I have no idea why they did that.)\n\nS01E03 Best Friends\n\nS01E04 Polly Parrot\n\nS01E09 Daddy Loses His Glasses\n\nS01E50 My Birthday Party\n\nS01E46 At the Beach\n\nS01E02 Mr Dinosaur is Lost. Mr Dinosaur is introduced in this episode! This is an awesome episode for practicing transcribing if you’ve studied S01E09 Daddy Loses His Glasses.\n\nS01E01 Muddy Puddles\n\nS01E03 Best Friends (Yes this episode shows up twice in this collection!)\n\nS01E41 Chloe’s Puppet Show. BTW, Chloe was introduced in S01E28.\n\nI am a fan of this collection. It covers a wide range of topics and all the episodes are good.\n\nEpisodes included in this collection:\n\nS01E19 New Shoes\n\nS01E20 Bicycles\n\nS01E09 Daddy Loses His Glasses\n\nS01E24 Treasure Hunt\n\nS01E22 The Tooth Fairy. BTW The tooth fairy isn’t a thing in China, but the episode explains what a tooth fairy is.\n\nS01E18 Dressing Up\n\nS01E11 Hiccups\n\nS01E08 Piggy in the Middle\n\nS01E05 Hide and Seek\n\nS01E15 Picnic\n\nS01E17 Frogs and Worms and Butterflies\n\nS01E07 Mummy Pig at Work, learn some words about computers!\n\nS01E03 Best Friends\n\nS01E14 Flying a Kite\n\nEpisodes included in this collection:\n\nS01E21 Mummy Pig’s Birthday. You can do transcribing exercise together with S01E50. Both birthday themed.\n\nGardening\n\nS01E01 Muddy Puddles\n\nS01E06 The Playgroup. The teacher Madame Gazelle and friends at daycare were introduced!\n\nS01E13 Secrets\n\nS01E04 Polly Parrot\n\nS01E16 Musical Instruments. It’s a good episode to learn names and verbs associated with musical instruments.\n\nS01E02 Mr Dinosaur is Lost\n\nS01E30 Babysitting\n\nS01E33 Cleaning the Car\n\nS01E37 The Tree House. I would say learning about tree houses isn’t too practical for Chinese but it is a useful episode for learning etiquette for going into somebody’s home.\n\nS01E45 Daddy Puts up a Picture\n\nS01E50 My Birthday Party\n\nS01E52 School Play. I am not a fan of this episode for learning Chinese, even though the story of 小红帽 is very well-known in China too.\n\nThis collection is following the order of the series as the title suggests.\n\nEpisodes included in this collection:\n\nS01E43 Tidying Up\n\nS01E44 The Playground I am not a fan of the translation of playground to “操场”\n\nS01E45 Daddy Puts up a Picture\n\nS01E46 At the Beach\n\nS01E47 Mister Skinnylegs\n\nS01E48 Grandpa Pig’s Boat\n\nS01E49 Shopping. Good episode to learn common food names.\n\nS01E50 My Birthday Party\n\nS01E51 Daddy’s Movie Camera\n\nS01E52 School Play\n\nThis collection is also following the order of the series as the title suggests. Not a huge fan of this collection because my daughter is scared by a couple episodes.\n\nS01E15 Picnic\n\nS01E16 Musical Instruments\n\nS01E17 Frogs and Worms and Butterflies\n\nS01E18 Dressing Up\n\nS01E19 New Shoes\n\nS01E20 The School Fete\n\nS01E21 Mummy Pig’s Birthday\n\nS01E22 The Tooth Fairy\n\nS01E23 The New Car. This episode scares my daughter. I don’t think it’s a good episode for repeats.\n\nS01E24 Treasure Hunt\n\nS01E25 Not Very Well. This episode also scares my daughter because of Peppa’s sickness.\n\nS01E26 Snow. You can learn a bunch of terms related to snow and snowman in this episode.\n\nS01E27 Windy Castle. This episode is more about the journey to get to the Windy Castle. I had no idea what a ”风息堡” is until I watched this episode.\n\nCall to Action\n\nAll Chinese language exposure is good exposure. Don’t feel bad about binge-watching!\n\nWith that said, practicing active listening is way more effective for learning the Chinese language. Please feel free to transcribe any of the episodes yourself. I would be happy to review!"
