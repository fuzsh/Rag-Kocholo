        "text": "Pig Standards\n\nPig Standards (pdf)\n\nThe Certified Animal Welfare Approved by AGW (AWA) seal is a hard earned badge of difference and demonstrates the farmer’s commitment to the care of their animals, the land and the local community. Farmers in this program will be distinguished by a humane and conscientious attitude towards the animals in their care as evidenced by physical audit and development of detailed plans and records of farm practices.\n\nFarmers in the program agree to a minimum of one visit a year from AGW staff or agents, with the possibility of additional visits if deemed necessary, to confirm compliance with the standards during various seasons and to allow observation of animals in different phases of life. Participation in the program is on an annual basis and must be renewed each year.\n\nThe premise of the AWA standards is that animals must be allowed to behave naturally. The following standards allow animals the opportunity to perform natural and instinctive behaviors essential to their health and well-being. Provisions are made to ensure social interaction, comfort, and physical and psychological well-being.\n\nThe AWA program is voluntary. The standards do not supersede national government or state legislation.\n\nAGW recommends that farmers have the Guide to Understanding Our Standards and Standards and Program Definitions documents at hand while reading these standards.\n\n1 OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION\n\n1.0.1 The individual or entity seeking AWA status for their livestock must own and have management control of the animals.\n\n1.0.2 The individual or entity seeking AWA status must produce a livestock product for sale or trade that is eligible to carry the AWA seal.\n\nNote: If the primary market is selling/trading livestock as pets, animals for 4H, FFA, show animals or pack animals or marketing meat from animals slaughtered at non-compliant slaughter facilities the farm cannot be AWA. See also section 14.1 if the primary market is breeding animals.\n\n1.0.3 The AWA Standards must be met for all the animals or birds of the species for which use of the label is sought. Farmers using “split” or “dual” systems, in which some animals or birds of one species are simultaneously kept in systems that do not meet AWA Standards must have a plan that demonstrates clear separation and traceability of operations. The plan must address:\n\n1.0.3.1 Physical Separation\n\n1.0.3.2 Financial Separation\n\n1.0.3.3 Operational Separation\n\nNote: The Dual Production Plan template must be filled out for determination of compliance if an operation has a split or dual system. AGW’s dual production policy is intended to support operations in expanding AGW-certified production. An operation must show that they are either operating separate businesses or distinctly separate product lines. A farm is not required to seek approval for all the species they manage simultaneously. If a farm has split or dual systems of the same species and cannot demonstrate clear traceability, AGW maintains the right to refuse to audit or certify the farm.\n\n1.0.4 AWA is a birth to slaughter program. Meat sold under the AWA label or logo must come from animals that have been certified as being raised to AWA standards and slaughtered using a method and at a location that has received written approval from AWA.\n\n1.0.4.1 If the farm does not intend to market meat from some or all of their animals under the AWA label, but owns or has control of an animal when it is slaughtered, the slaughter process must meet the AWA Slaughter Guidelines for Red Meat.\n\n1.0.5 The certified farm may participate in networks, co-operatives or marketing groups in order to market livestock products as AWA as long as each member is audited as meeting all other requirements listed in these standards.\n\n1.0.6 All those working with animals must be competent to carry out the tasks required of them.\n\nNote: This standard applies to contract and temporary workers as well as full time employees and family members.\n\n2 BREEDS AND ORIGIN OF ANIMALS\n\n2.0 Breeds and Origin– General Standards\n\n2.0.1 Breeds and strains must be chosen with consideration of their ability to thrive in the prevailing climatic conditions of the farm, in pasture-based, free range, outdoor systems.\n\n2.0.2 Cloned or genetically engineered animals are prohibited.\n\nNote: This includes the use of cloned or genetically engineered breeding stock, the offspring of clones or genetically engineered animals and semen from cloned or genetically engineered animals.\n\n2.0.3 Breeding replacements may come from farms that are not certified by AWA but must be of a suitable breed or type for pasture based production under these standards.\n\n2.0.4 A record of the source, date of purchase and number of breeding animals must be kept.\n\n2.0.5 Recommended Wherever possible the farm should run a closed herd.\n\nNote: A closed herd is one where no animals are brought onto the farm from external sources. Farms that do not have the genetic diversity or the expertise to achieve this should partner with experienced breeders to source their animals and learn more about selection criteria.\n\n2.0.6 Rescue animals and animals sold as culls from other herds cannot be bought into the AWA herd.\n\nNote: If an experienced farmer is asked to participate in rescue activities they must contact AGW as soon as possible and preferably before rescue animals arrive on farm to discuss their options. Rescue animals cannot be used or marketed as AWA.\n\n2.1 The Pig Breeding Herd\n\nNote: Artificial insemination is permitted.\n\n2.1.1 – 2.1.2 Not allocated.\n\n2.1.3 The ability to successfully give birth independently must be taken into account in modifications over time to herd genetics.\n\nNote: In order to score this standard the auditor will assess the number of assisted births.\n\n2.1.4 Embryo transfer is prohibited.\n\n2.1.5 In breeding programs, attention must be paid to breed characteristics that will improve welfare such as susceptibility to lameness, susceptibility to heat stress and longevity.\n\n2.1.6 Not allocated.\n\n2.1.7 Pigs selected for breeding must be chosen for their good maternal qualities, hardiness and ability to meet the needs of their piglets.\n\n2.2 Not Allocated\n\n2.3 Animals Raised for Meat\n\n2.3.1 Feeder or store pigs to be raised for meat must only be obtained from AWA farms.\n\nNote: Where no livestock from certified farms is available, please contact AGW for more information on sourcing feeder or store animals.\n\n3 HEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\n3.0 Health Planning and Preventative Management\n\nHealth and management planning increases both positive welfare and productivity.\n\n3.0.1 Animal management must be focused on promoting health rather than treating disease.\n\n3.0.2 Each farmer in the AWA program must establish contact with a qualified expert such as a veterinarian. The qualified expert must be familiar with:\n\n3.0.2.1 The animals on the farm.\n\n3.0.2.2 The health requirements of the state.\n\n3.0.2.3 Methods to maximize animal health and welfare.\n\n3.0.3 Recommended Each farmer should schedule regular preventative care visits by a qualified expert.\n\nNote: AGW will provide support and assistance in achieving this standard.\n\n3.0.4 A health plan emphasizing prevention of illness or injury must be prepared in consultation with the farm’s qualified expert advisor to promote positive health and limit the need for treatment. It must address:\n\n3.0.4.1 Avoidance of physical, nutritional or environmental stress.\n\n3.0.4.2 Lameness.\n\n3.0.4.3 Climatic considerations.\n\n3.0.4.4 Vaccinations and other methods to cope with prevailing disease challenges.\n\n3.0.4.5 Biosecurity measures.\n\n3.0.4.6 Nutrition.\n\n3.0.4.7 Environmental impacts, including manure management and run-off.\n\n3.0.4.8 Ranging and foraging area management.\n\n3.0.4.9 Exclusion of predators and control of rats and mice.\n\n3.0.4.10 Euthanasia.\n\n3.0.4.11 Mastitis.\n\nNote: See Standard 11.1.2 for recommendations on review/update of plans.\n\n3.0.5 If there is disease or known risk of disease on farm vaccines must be used.\n\nNote: In order to help eliminate or reduce vulnerability to disease and the need for antibiotics at therapeutic levels, AGW encourages the appropriate use of vaccines on an individual or group basis for prevention of disease.\n\n3.0.6 Action must be taken to address any causes of lameness.\n\n3.0.7 Recommended Farmers should participate in recognized disease eradication programs.\n\nNote: AGW supports management to eliminate or reduce the risk of certain diseases and farmers are therefore encouraged to engage with programs that seek to achieve this. Recognized schemes could be national or state wide.\n\nThis standard may become required for specific diseases when a funded and functioning program is available.\n\n3.1 Treatment\n\n3.1.1 Any sick or injured animals on the farm must be treated immediately to minimize pain and distress. This must include veterinary treatment if required.\n\n3.1.1.1 Homeopathic, herbal or other non-antibiotic alternative treatments are preferred.\n\n3.1.1.2 If alternative treatments are not suitable or not effective or if a veterinarian has recommended antibiotic treatment, this must be administered.\n\n3.1.1.3 Withholding treatment in order to preserve an animal’s eligibility for market is prohibited.\n\nNote: The discovery of untreated injured or ill animals may be grounds for removal from the program.\n\n3.1.2 The sub-therapeutic and/or non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, or any other medicines, to control or prevent disease or promote growth, is prohibited.\n\n3.1.3 Growth hormones or the use of any other substances promoting weight gain are prohibited.\n\nNote: Probiotics to promote positive health are permitted.\n\n3.1.3.1 The use of ractopamine (Paylean) is prohibited.\n\n3.1.4 Substances to induce estrus must only be used when there is a therapeutic need or when a welfare benefit can be demonstrated.\n\n3.1.5 Records must be kept of the administration of veterinary medical products.\n\n3.1.5.1 Date of purchase.\n\n3.1.5.2 Name of product.\n\n3.1.5.3 Quantity purchased.\n\n3.1.5.4 Identity of the animals treated.\n\n3.1.5.5 Reason why animals were treated.\n\n3.1.5.6 Number of animals treated.\n\n3.1.5.7 Date when treatment started and finished.\n\n3.1.5.8 Withdrawal time.\n\n3.1.6 Animals treated with an antibiotic must not be slaughtered to produce meat for the AWA program before a period of time has passed that is at least twice the licensed withdrawal period of the antibiotic used.\n\n3.1.7 Animals treated with any off-label medication must not be slaughtered to produce meat for the AWA program until at least seven days after medication, or an alternative withdrawal as advised by a veterinarian.\n\n3.1.7.1 Animals must not be treated with any medications prohibited for food animal use.\n\n3.1.8 Any surgical procedure not covered by these standards must be carried out by a veterinarian.\n\n3.2 Parasites\n\n3.2.1 The primary methods of preventing parasite infestations must be ranging and foraging area management or rotation and bedding management and removal.\n\n3.2.2 If prevention has not been effective, medicine regimens must be implemented to effectively control worms, lice, mange and any other parasites.\n\n3.2.3 The use of organophosphates and other products with the same or a similar mode of action is prohibited.\n\nNote: An exception to the standard above may be considered if other treatments have been shown to be ineffective. Please refer to the AGW paper on organophosphate and non-organophosphate type products.\n\n3.2.4 Recommended Fecal samples to monitor internal parasite burdens should be taken at least annually.\n\n3.2.5 Fecal samples must be reviewed by a competent person.\n\n3.2.6 Recommended Fecal samples should be taken during the growing season when animals are out on the ranging and foraging area.\n\n3.3 Euthanasia\n\nNote: When local or national authorities order the killing of a herd or if any large-scale euthanasia is about to take place to eradicate disease, AGW must be notified as soon as possible.\n\n3.3.1 Animals experiencing pain or suffering from which they are unlikely to recover must be promptly euthanized on the farm in a manner that renders the animal immediately insensible to pain.\n\nNote: Please contact AGW if further information on appropriate methods of euthanasia is required.\n\n3.3.2 Euthanizing pigs in a way that causes unnecessary pain or suffering is prohibited. Prohibited methods include:\n\n3.3.2.1 Electrocution.\n\n3.3.2.2 Suffocation.\n\n3.3.2.3 Exsanguination without prior unconsciousness.\n\n3.3.2.4 Poison.\n\n3.3.2.5 Blow to the head by blunt instrument on piglets heavier than 12lbs (5.5kg).\n\nNote: A blow to the head by blunt instrument on piglets below 12lbs (5kg) is only acceptable if a preferred method is not readily available and the animal would suffer if euthanasia was not carried out immediately.\n\n4 ANIMAL MANAGEMENT\n\n4.0 General Animal Management\n\n4.0.1 Not allocated.\n\n4.0.2 All pigs must be thoroughly inspected at least twice per 24 hours.\n\nNote: During the inspection the welfare of each animal must be observed. If any animal is not in a state of well-being, it must be cared for immediately and corrective measures must be taken. During a time of increased risk to health and welfare, inspections must be increased as necessary to protect the animal’s well-being.\n\n4.0.3 Not allocated.\n\n4.0.4 Animals must be maintained at body condition score 2 or above on a 1-5 scale.\n\n4.0.5 Breeding animals must not exceed body condition score 4 on a 1-5 scale.\n\n4.1 Not Allocated\n\n4.2 Group Management\n\n4.2.1 All classes of animals must be sorted (for example by age, size and/or behavior) so that they remain in stable groups and the welfare of less dominant animals is protected. Mixing animals from different groups should be avoided.\n\n4.2.2 Pregnant sows must be kept in groups.\n\n4.2.3 Special care must be taken when mixing breeding males to socialize them to one another as safely as possible and to minimize harm to individuals.\n\n4.2.4 Recommended Male breeding animals should be kept with the main herd or have nose to nose contact with other animals of the same species.\n\nNote: No animal can be kept completely in isolation unless it is sick or injured (see Standard 8.3.3). If a male breeding animal has to be kept away from other animals of the same species, it must have a compatible companion of another species.\n\n4.3 Breeding and Farrowing\n\n4.3.1 A competent person must be available at birthing time to assist if problems are anticipated at delivery.\n\n4.3.2 – 4.3.3 Not allocated.\n\n4.3.4 Gilts must not farrow before the age of 10 months.\n\nNote: Young females may reach puberty before the optimal age of first service.

Both extensive and rotational systems are permitted.\n\n7.0.5 The amount of outdoor area must be such that the health and welfare of the animals and ranging and foraging area quality is maintained.\n\n7.0.6 Ranging and foraging areas and the fencing that surrounds them must be designed and maintained so they do not pose a risk, or inflict injury on the animals.\n\nNote: This includes keeping ranging and foraging areas free of old fencing, old farm machinery and any other debris that could cause injury.\n\n7.0.7 Animals must have access to ranging and foraging areas that are well drained and clean.\n\n7.0.8 A ranging and foraging area management plan must be in place that addresses the specific farm site. It must ensure that:\n\n7.0.8.1 Not allocated.\n\n7.0.8.2 Pigs must have access to growing green vegetation on the range whenever conditions allow.\n\n7.0.8.3 The composition of the ranging and foraging areas does not create health problems for the animals.\n\n7.0.8.4 Animals have access to fresh, clean ranging and foraging areas that has not become polluted with manure.\n\n7.0.8.5 The location of water, shelter, and feeding areas is addressed.\n\nNote: See Standard 11.1.2 for recommendations on review/update of plans.\n\n7.0.9 Soil testing must be conducted at least every three years.\n\nNote: Farmers with extensive, unfertilized range lands and/or farming land on short term lease agreements should contact AGW for guidance on appropriate soil testing intervals.\n\n7.0.9.1 Recommended Annual soil testing should be carried out in any ranging and foraging areas where manure is spread.\n\n7.0.9.2 Recommended Annual soil testing should be carried out in any areas where pigs have been kept.\n\n7.0.10 Recommended Annual testing of pasture or forage nutritional content is recommended (see also 6.0.2).\n\n7.0.11 Herbicides and pesticides may only be used when weeds or pests cannot be practically controlled by other means.\n\n7.0.12 Herbicides and pesticides must be mixed, used and disposed of according to manufacturer’s instructions to avoid environmental contamination.\n\n7.0.13 Animals must not be grazed or kept on land within 21 days of direct application of herbicides or pesticides.\n\n7.0.14 The use of any manures or fertilizers for ranging and foraging areas that are bought in from off-farm must be justified by soil testing and crop nutritional need.\n\n7.0.15 Waste from on-farm slaughter, and the remains of animals that die or are euthanized on farm must be properly composted before it is applied to ranging and foraging areas.\n\n7.0.16 Fish fertilizers must come from sustainable sources.\n\n7.0.17 After the application of fish fertilizer, the composted remains of animals that die or are euthanized on farm or slaughter waste to ranging and foraging areas there must be an interval of at least one month, or until all visible signs of the application have disappeared (whichever is longer), before animals use the land.\n\nNote: Permission may be granted to allow animals to use the land prior to one month after application of composted animal remains, slaughter waste or fish fertilizer if it can be demonstrated that animals will not be exposed to any trace of the fertilizer.\n\n7.0.18 Recommended Manures and fertilizers that can have a negative effect on soil microbial life and/or which contain heavy metals should be avoided.\n\n7.0.19 Water sources on the farm must be managed and maintained to prevent environmental pollution.\n\n7.0.20 Land must be managed to avoid erosion.\n\nNote: AGW understands that even with the best management some erosion due to the activities of pasture based livestock may occur. This standard is scored against the steps farmers take to try to avoid and/or minimize erosion risks rather than the presence or absence of erosion on the farm. A complete absence of any erosion is desirable – but it is accepted that it may not always be possible.\n\n7.0.21 Ranging and foraging areas must not be degraded by overuse and/or other management techniques.\n\n7.0.22 Non-point pollution and other local environmental standards must be met.\n\n7.0.23 Ranging and foraging areas on which animals have been out-wintered or that are otherwise worn out or denuded must be restored.\n\n7.0.24 Not allocated.\n\n7.0.25 Spraying neonicotinoids on pasture land owned or managed by the approved farm is prohibited.\n\n7.0.26 Recommended Neonicotinoids should not be sprayed on any land owned or managed by the approved farm.\n\nNote: There is increasing evidence that neonicotinoids not only adversely affect bees, but other wildlife. These products are already prohibited in many countries and AGW will continue to monitor published research on this topic.\n\n7.1 Not Allocated\n\n7.2 Ranging and Foraging Area Access for Pigs\n\n7.2.1 Ranging and foraging areas must have evidence of grown vegetative cover within the last calendar year (refer to ranging and foraging area plan 7.0.8).\n\n7.2.2 Where vegetative cover cannot be maintained throughout the year manipulable material must be provided (refer to ranging and foraging area plan 7.0.8).\n\n7.2.3 Recommended Denuded ranging and foraging areas should be rested and allowed to regenerate after each group of pigs.\n\n7.2.4 When pigs are at risk of heat stress, wallows or sprinklers, in combination with natural or artificial shade, must be provided.\n\n7.2.5 Confinement systems, in-house or field-based pens or cages that restrict the pigs’ natural behaviors, are prohibited.\n\n7.2.6 Any ranging and foraging enclosure area provided for pigs must offer separate dunging, feeding, wallowing and foraging areas.\n\n7.2.6.1 The minimum pen size for pigs must be 1400 sq. ft.\n\n7.2.6.2 Each adult pig must have at least 700 sq. ft. of space.\n\n7.2.6.3 Each market pig must have at least 56 sq. ft. of space.\n\n7.3 – 7.4 Not Allocated\n\n7.5 Exclusion from Ranging and Foraging Areas\n\nFor the purposes of these standards AGW defines exclusion from ranging and foraging areas as the following:\n\nShutting animals into a house or barn.\n\nKeeping animals outdoors, outside of the growing season, on a sacrifice pasture (or similar).\n\nKeeping animals outdoors when the ranging and foraging area is covered to the point that animals cannot access vegetation (e.g. when the ranging and foraging area is snow covered).\n\nAnimals who have been properly selected for the specific climate conditions will voluntarily choose to go outdoors in all but the most extreme weather. However when exclusion is in the best interest of the animal the standards in the following section and those in section 8 must be met.\n\n7.5.1 Animals may only be removed from ranging and foraging areas and housed when their welfare would otherwise be negatively affected.\n\nNote: Acceptable reasons for removal from ranging and foraging areas could include the following: extreme weather, emergencies; for example wildfires or ensuring piglets for up to four weeks post weaning have adapted to solid feed and are trained to fencing.\n\n7.5.2 If there is planned removal of animals from ranging and foraging areas for any length of time OR in an emergency where removal from ranging and foraging areas exceeds 28 days, the farmer must put into place a written plan for animal management. It must include:\n\n7.5.2.1 Triggers for housing such as temperature, precipitation or soil condition.\n\n7.5.2.2 Space available to each housed animal.\n\n7.5.2.3 Facilities available to house the animals. These must include lying areas, loafing areas, feeding areas and space to enable animals to fulfill their behavioral needs.\n\n7.5.2.4 Triggers for animals to be returned to the ranging and foraging areas.\n\nNote: It is not acceptable to use a particular date during the year as a trigger for either housing or return to ranging and foraging areas. Triggers should relate to the identified risk to the welfare of the animals under particular climatic or environmental scenarios.\n\n7.6 Exclusion from Ranging and Foraging Areas for Pigs\n\n7.6.1 When pigs are excluded from ranging and foraging areas they must be provided with sufficient material they can manipulate so that they can engage in rooting and foraging behavior.\n\n8 HOUSING AND SHELTER\n\n8.0 General Housing Standards\n\n8.0.1 Not allocated\n\n8.0.2 The thermal comfort of pigs must be protected by provision of housing or shelter with natural or mechanical temperature and humidity control as required. The needs of all ages and stages of production and local climatic extremes must be taken into account when planning housing or shelter.\n\nNote: This standard does not supersede 4.3.15, which requires a hut, arc or pen for sows about to farrow. For other types of pig particular attention must be paid to predation and management of thermal stress if shelter without a roof is being considered.\n\nIf the temperature drops below 59F (15C) for more than 7 days in a row, natural shelter is not sufficient to protect pig thermal comfort and man made arks, huts or barns must be provided.\n\n8.0.3 In extreme weather there must be a means to feed and water animals in a sheltered environment.\n\n8.0.4 Shelters and housing must be positioned away from areas of run off or potential run off.\n\n8.0.5 Shelters and housing must be well ventilated and allow fresh air to enter.\n\n8.0.6 Shelters and housing must allow natural light to enter.\n\n8.0.7 All housing, huts, arks and other facilities (such as feeders and water troughs) must be designed and maintained in such a way that they do not pose a risk, or inflict injury or damage to the animals.\n\n8.0.8 Animals must not be subjected to dim and/or continuous lighting or kept in permanent darkness.\n\n8.0.9 In the daytime, the animals must always be able to see each other, their food and water sources, as well as their surroundings clearly.\n\n8.0.10 Inspection of animals must be possible at any time day or night.\n\n8.0.11 Use of artificial light must not extend the maximum day-length beyond 16 hours.\n\n8.0.12 When animals are shut into housing or shelter any artificial light must be distributed evenly.\n\n8.0.13 Not allocated.\n\n8.0.14 Shelters and housing for pigs must have solid floors.\n\nNote: Floors may be natural – the surface of the ground or pasture – or artificial.

any changes on farm that could result in a deviation from the standards.\n\nNote: The farmer must AGW if they change slaughter plant from that which is listed on their certificate – even if the change is to another plant that has been reviewed and recommended by AWA.\n\n15.0.2 Temporary deviations will be taken into consideration when unexpected circumstances that are not under the control of the farmer arise.\n\n15.0.3 All other deviations from the AWA standards can be cause for reconsideration of the farmer’s participation or removal from the AWA program and use of its seal, in conjunction with that farmer’s products.\n\n15.1 Derogations\n\n15.1.1 If, in the opinion of the AWA Standards Board, a system meets all of the principles of the program but does not pass a specific standard or standards, derogation may be granted.\n\n15.1.2 In order for a derogation to be granted, an inspection report must be submitted stating the deviation from the published standard, the reason for this deviation, the length of time this deviation from standards will occur and the welfare outcome should the derogation be granted.\n\n15.1.3 Derogation may be granted for on-farm trials and case studies that deviate from the standards when the proposed outcome is a benefit to animal welfare and/or farmer education.\n\n15.2 Complaints\n\n15.2.1 A complaints record relating to complaints about AWA certified livestock or products must be maintained and be available at annual inspection. The record must list both the complaint and the action taken by the farm.\n\nNote: The AWA program is accredited to ISO 17065 and it is a requirement of our certification that farms within the program maintain a record in the rare event that any complaint is made. AGW does not expect that farms in the program will receive complaints about their certified livestock or products, but if any are received they must be recorded along with the response from the farm.\n\n16 SLAUGHTER\n\n16.0 Slaughter of pigs\n\n16.0.1 Recommended On-farm slaughter is recommended.\n\n16.0.2 Recommended Controlled Atmosphere Killing (CAK), in which pigs remain in groups and their oxygen is slowly replaced by a mixture of argon and/or nitrogen and carbon dioxide is recommended for pigs.\n\nNote: On-farm mobile slaughter and CAK are not readily available. It is the goal of AGW to make these processes more widely available and acceptable for USDA-approved programs.\n\n16.0.3 Slaughterhouses receiving animals in the AWA program, or the process of slaughtering on-farm, must pass a review by the AWA program for pre-slaughter handling, stunning, and killing.\n\nNote: For further details of the review requirements see the AWA Slaughter Guidelines for Red Meat.\n\n16.0.4 Recommended The person delivering the animals to slaughter should stay with them to ensure that they are slaughtered according to AWA guidelines.\n\n16.0.5 Downed animals must be euthanized where they lie in a manner that renders them immediately insensible to pain.\n\nNote: Please contact AGW if further information on appropriate methods of euthanasia is required.\n\n16.0.6 Meat from downed animals must not be sold or carry the AWA seal.\n\n17 TRACEABILITY\n\n17.0.1 Producers must use the applicable logo on certified products unless otherwise agreed with AGW.\n\n17.0.2 Records must ensure an input/output balance can be carried out on a product with an AGW log and must be retained for at least two years.\n\n17.0.3 AGW must approve logo use prior to certified sales."
