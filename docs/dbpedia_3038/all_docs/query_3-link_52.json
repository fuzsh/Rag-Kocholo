But what inspired Blabey to create this delightful tale? Let’s take a closer look at the journey behind “Pig the Pug.”\n\nAaron Blabey, an Australian author and illustrator, began his career as an actor before turning his attention to children’s literature. In a 2018 interview with “The Sydney Morning Herald,” Blabey shared that he started writing children’s books after a life-changing car accident in 2006. The accident left him with a profound sense of gratitude and a newfound appreciation for life, and he decided to pursue his passion for storytelling and illustration.\n\n“Pig the Pug” was first published in 2014 and quickly became a hit with young readers due to its engaging story, entertaining characters, and the moral lesson it imparts. The book is the first in a series featuring Pig, a selfish and greedy pug, and his good-natured friend Trevor, a dachshund. The story is known for its rhyming text, humor, and eye-catching illustrations.\n\nThe inspiration for “Pig the Pug” came from Blabey’s love for animals, particularly dogs. He mentioned in a 2017 interview with “Books+Publishing” that he had always been drawn to the idea of creating a character who was “an awful little monster” but still managed to be lovable. Blabey found the perfect balance in Pig, a character who is both funny and relatable, despite his flaws.\n\nDive into the hilarious world of Pig and Trevor!
