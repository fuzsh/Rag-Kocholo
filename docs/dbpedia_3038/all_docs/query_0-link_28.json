        "text": "Owhayarehayouyay?Atwhayiswayouryayamenay? Elcomeway. Sounds almost like something out of the Sims, doesn’t it? If this doesn’t make sense to you, welcome to Pig Latin. The phrases above translate to; How are you? What’s your name? And Welcome.\n\nPig Latin is a pseudo-language or argot where we use a formal technique altering English words. The basic rule is to switch the first consonant or consonant cluster to the end of the term and then adding suffix “ay” to form a new word. For instance, the word ‘pig’ would become igp+ay which becomes igpay.\n\nIt is a typical language game for children who want to use a coded language in sports or to confuse adults. But this unique language has also found its way to literature (such as the famous Dragon Slayer books), advertising and many other areas.\n\nIf you want to work in advertising, translation or other areas where words are crucial, you might find it necessary to learn this playful language. This guide delves into the exciting world of Pig Latin to help new users find their ways around the rules and usage.\n\nBut if you prefer to watch a video instead, click here:\n\nThis post was updated on March 2021\n\nHistory of Pig Latin\n\nThe phrase Pig Latin seems to imply there’s a connection with the language used by Romans for centuries. However, this is not the case as this language game originated from kids’ play in the 1800s. It was initially known as Hog Latin before taking the more formal term Pig Latin.\n\nHowever, there are earlier mentions of this type of language game which was then called dog Latin. It was a parody of the Latin language which had become a language of the elite in the middle ages. Shakespeare’s 1598 play, Love’s Labour’s Lost references dog Latin implying a play on English words.\n\nThe earliest mention of Hog Latin was in an article published in 1866. It referred to the addition of letters to a word to form a language used by young boys and is similar to Pig Latin today. Another mention was in May 1869 in Putnam’s Magazine.\n\nThe use of this language game referred to a Latin-esque gibberish which mocked people who still used the dying Latin language. The release of the song Pig Latin Love in 1919 popularized the language game among kids and made more people start noticing.\n\nWhile many words in this language are momentary, some have caught on quickly and lingered. Examples include “Ixnay” from ‘nix,’ and “Amscray,” an alteration of “scram.” The 1929 film “Broadway Melody” featured the term “Ixnay” and the word has remained in common usage since then.\n\nIn literature, author Kate McMullan of the Dragon Slayers’ Academy serine is one of the leading supporters of Pig Latin. She has used the playful language for her lead character Wiglaf. Such mainstream use of the language game has made it popular and seen interest in its use grow. Radio ads and slang are other areas where Pig Latin has grown over the years.\n\nIn 2014, Pig Latin made news in a court pitting Microsoft against Google. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the advertising watchdog, ruled in favor of Microsoft in a legal battle with Google’s Gmail.\n\nIt was regarding an advert where Microsoft had addressed Gmail users about their safety. The company implied that Gmail users would have to understand and use Pig Latin to prevent the email provider from reading their emails.\n\nTranslation Rules for Pig Latin\n\nLike with any new language, it is crucial to learn the formal rules of pig Latin. This not only gives you a solid foundation in the language game, but it also helps you understand its usage. These rules will also come handy if you have a text to translate to pig Latin.\n\n1. Words Beginning With Consonants/Consonant Clusters\n\nPick any English word. The name could start with a consonant or consonant cluster or a vowel.\n\nIf you’ve got a word starting with a consonant cluster or consonant move the consonant or consonant cluster from the initial location of that particular word to the last position of the name.\n\nAdd a suffix the suffix “-ay” to the end of the word.\n\nExample:\n\nDuck becomes uckd+ay to form the pig Altin word uckday\n\nMove become ovem+ay to form ovemay\n\nScratch becomes atchscr+ay to form atchsray\n\n2. Words Beginning With Vowels\n\nIf you want to create a Pig Latin word from an English word starting with a vowel, add the suffix “-yay”, “-way”, or “-ay” at the end of the original word. For instance,\n\nOval becomes ovalyay\n\nUltimate become ultimateyay\n\nOdd becomes oddyay\n\n3. For Words Starting With the Letter ‘Y’\n\nThe letter ‘Y’ creates a tricky situation when forming words in Pig Latin. Users have to determine whether the letter is a vowel or consonant based on its location in a name. Here are some essential facts to remember:\n\ni) When the latter ‘Y’ comes are the beginning of an English word, you consider it a consonant. This means you move it to the end of the term and then add suffix –ay. For instance;\n\nYellow becomes ellowy+ay to form ellowyay\n\nYear becomes eary+ay to form earyay\n\nii) When the letter ‘Y’ appears in the second position of a word, the standard rules for word formation apply. E.g\n\nDyke becomes yked+ay to form ykeday\n\niii) If you have a consonant cluster at the beginning of the word and the letter ‘Y’ comes at the end of this cluster, you treat it as a vowel and hence doesn’t move with the consonant cluster. Example:\n\nRhythm becomes ythmrh+ay to form ythmrhay\n\n4. Creating Pig Latin words from Compound Words\n\nYou should first separate the compound word into individual words and apply the appropriate rules. For instance,\n\nBathroom becomes athbayoomray\n\nToothbrush becomes oothtayushbray\n\nHow to Get Started With Translating Pig Latin\n\nNow that you know the rules, the next step is, of course, to apply them in your translation project.

Go From The Known To The Unknown\n\nPig Latin is a new language to you, and with this in mind, you should start with translating the most common words and phrases before moving onto more sophisticated sentence constructions. This is the cardinal rule in learning any language. As you get used to the common phrases, it will become easier to apply translation rules to more complex expressions.\n\n4. Research Pig Latin\n\nIf you want to build a career in Pig Latin translation, take time to dig deeper into the language game and learn how it came about.

In such a case, the term ‘earn become ‘earnway’ rather than ‘earnay.’ These variations are correct, and if you have a client’s project, it’s essential to confirm which version of Pig Latin to use in the translation.\n\n5.
