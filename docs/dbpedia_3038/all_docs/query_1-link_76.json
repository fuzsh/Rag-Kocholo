        "text": "“My dad was on his deathbed, I mean, my dad’s prognosis early on was very, very, very bad. And the doctors have done everything in their power to keep him alive. They basically said he had less than six months and that this was very experimental. He could — He could not live or he could last a day or he could last a couple of days. I mean, we’re in the unknown at this point. It was very difficult for him to make this decision. But at the end of the day, this was his best hope of getting out of the hospital and having somewhat of a normal quality of life.” “We wouldn’t give him a worse outcome and we had a chance, perhaps, of striking a good one. He himself said, ‘I want to live and if I don’t, you’ll learned something.’ I wish we knew more. But we’re learning a lot every day with this gentleman. And so far, we’re happy with our decision to move forward, and he is as well. Big smile on his face today. I think it’s significant because we don’t have a source of human organ replacement of sufficient numbers to answer demand and not only demand, but a timely demand. And there are people who, because of the scarcity of the human heart and its relative value, who just are not included in transplantation for age and other reasons.”"
