        "text": "Here at Paultons Park, we’re home to the world’s first Peppa Pig theme park; Peppa Pig World. As you can imagine, we’re huge fans of the show and absolutely love all things Peppa. Today, as a special treat, we thought we’d take a short trip down memory lane to look back at the history of Peppa Pig and reminisce about how it all got started.\n\nIn this article, we’ll be looking at the timeline of Peppa Pig, all the way from creation to the global phenomenon it is today.\n\nWho created Peppa Pig?\n\nPeppa Pig was created by Astley Baker Davies; an independent animation studio based in London, owned by Peppa Pig co-creators and producers Neville Astley, Mark Baker and Phil Davies.\n\nAnimators Neville Astley and Mark Baker were the co-founders of the animated series.\n\nWhen did Peppa Pig first air?\n\nThe first ever episode of Peppa Pig aired on 31 May 2004. The show was originally broadcast on Channel 5.\n\nIs Peppa Pig based on a book?\n\nNo, Peppa Pig is not based on a book. There is a series of books based on Peppa Pig, however the animated series came first. One of these books, Peppa meets the Queen, was written in celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.\n\nHow did the creators come up with Peppa Pig?\n\nAnimators Neville Astley and Mark Baker wanted to create a children’s animated series that had clear and concise story lines with beginnings, middles and endings. They also wanted to create a main character who was a girl but who was different to the existing portrayals of princesses and ballerinas, so they created four year old Peppa who is confident, bright and cheeky.\n\nWhat does Peppa Pig wear?\n\nTitle character, Peppa Pig, wears a red dress as the creators wanted her outfit to reflect her slightly fiery personality. Occasionally Peppa is depicted in yellow rainboots and a coat. Peppa wears her yellow boots when jumping in muddy puddles, which is one of her favourite activities.\n\nWho was the first voice of Peppa Pig?\n\nThe first person to voice Peppa Pig was four year old actress Lily Snowden-Fine. Lily also provided the voice for Peppa Pig in the pilot episode and continued to portray Peppa for the duration of the first series. Read more about the actresses who have played Peppa Pig.\n\nHow long did Harley Bird voice Peppa Pig?\n\nHarley Bird provided the voice for Peppa Pig for 13 years from 2007 to 2020. She was just five years old when she got the part and was the third actress to play Peppa Pig.\n\nWho voices Peppa Pig now?\n\nEnglish actress Amelie Bea Smith has been the voice of Peppa Pig since taking over from Harley Bird in 2020.\n\nWhen did Peppa Pig first air in the US?\n\nPeppa Pig first aired on Cartoon Network’s Tickle-U segment for preschoolers on 22 August 2005. Since February 2011, Peppa Pig has aired on Nick Jr as a half hour show. The first 2 series of Peppa Pig were re-dubbed with American actors but since 2007 the series has been shown with the original British soundtrack in the US.\n\nHow many episodes of Peppa Pig have there been?\n\nAs of March 2022 there have been 368 episodes of Peppa Pig.\n\nWhat other countries is Peppa Pig available in?\n\nPeppa Pig is watched in 180 countries and is dubbed in 40+ languages. The show has become an international sensation.\n\nIs Peppa Pig shown in Australia?\n\nYes. Peppa Pig is available to watch in Australia with the exception of Mister Skinnylegs, which is an episode that features a friendly spider called Mister Skinnylegs. The episode encourages children to overcome their fear of spiders by befriending them, which was deemed inappropriate for Australian audiences due to the number of dangerous spiders native to Australia.\n\nWho writes the Peppa Pig songs?\n\nThe Peppa Pig songs are upbeat, catchy and family-friendly. A number of songwriters have contributed to Peppa Pig, including Clare Bradley, Julian Nott and Paul Moessl.\n\nPeppa Pig has a number of associated songs including the series theme tune, in-episode songs, charity singles and studio albums.\n\nWho wrote Bing Bong Champion?\n\nBing Bong Champion was written by Clare Bradley and Paul Moessl.\n\nWhen did Peppa Pig World open?\n\nPeppa Pig World first opened on 9 April 2011. Peppa Pig World is a themed area within Paultons Park, which is a family friendly theme park in Hampshire, England. The theme park area features 9 super fun, Peppa themed rides and numerous other attractions. Book your tickets to Peppa Pig World today."
