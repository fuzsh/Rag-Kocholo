        "text": "I love children’s books, and if you didn’t know already, I’m a children’s book author! One of my favorite books I read as a child was the Three Little Pigs. Joseph Jacobs, was the author, and it was first published on June 19, 1890. This story has been loved around the world for over a century.\n\nWhen the three little pigs decide to leave home, they build houses made of straw, branches, and bricks. They knew that the big bad wolf would come around to blow each house down, but which house will stay standing? I think we all know the story, but here’s how it was written:\n\nOnce upon a time, there were three little pigs. One pig built a house of straw, while the second pig built his house with sticks. They built their houses very quickly and then sang and danced all day because they were lazy. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.\n\nA big bad wolf saw the two little pigs while they danced and played. The wolf thought, “What juicy tender meals they will make!” He chased the two pigs and they ran and hid in their houses.\n\nThe big bad wolf went to the first house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes. The frightened little pig ran to the second pig’s house that was made of sticks. The big bad wolf now came to this house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time. Now, the two little pigs were terrified and ran to the third pig’s house that was made of bricks.\n\nThe big bad wolf tried to huff and puff and blow the third house down, but he could not. He kept trying for hours but the house was very strong and the little pigs were safe inside. He tried to enter through the chimney but the third little pig boiled a big pot of water and kept it below the chimney. The wolf fell into it and died.\n\nThe two little pigs now felt sorry for having been so lazy. They, too, built their houses with bricks and lived happily ever after.\n\nTwo of the pigs didn’t put a lot of thought into their houses and were defeated by the wolf.\n\nThe third pig built a sturdy home that took a lot of time and thought process. Then he rested, knowing his home would stand up to the wolf’s plans. This pig was not defeated by the wolf.\n\nAre you like the first two pigs who hurried to get something done quickly? Are you still worn out, tired, and defeated? Or, are you like the third pig who planned, and prepared himself a sturdy home to withstand the enemy?\n\nThe process may be tiresome, but be strong and courageous!\n\nJoshua 1:9 Have I not commanded you be strong and courageous? Do not be terrified. Do not be discouraged. For the Lord your God will be with you wherever you may go.\n\nGod will give you the strength to go through what you must. He is with you every step of the way showing you how to live and be a great mom! You are never alone!\n\nBe-In-Couraged! You can be strong & courageous even when you feel tired and worn out."
