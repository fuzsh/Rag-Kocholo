        "text": "The Three Little Pigs\n\nDown in the valley was a farm. On the farm there was a pigsty. And in the pigsty lived Mummy Pig and The Three Little Pigs.\n\n“You are growing so fast my dears,” said Mummy Pig to the three little Pigs. “Soon there'll be no space for you here. It is time for you to leave the farm and build your own houses to live in.”\n\nBefore leaving, Mummy Pig gave each of the three little Pigs a packed lunch box and told them something very important. So she said, “You must remember to build your house out of bricks. Bricks are very strong and they'll keep you safe no matter what.”\n\nThe Three Little Pigs set off down the lane to the brickyard, leaving Mummy Pig all alone in the sty.\n\nAfter a short while they came across the next door farmer ploughing his field.\n\nThe first little Pig thought to himself, “By golly, if I build my house out of this farmer’s straw then I’ll save myself a trip to the brickyard and build my house in half the time!”\n\nSo the first little Pig said to the farmer, “I’d like a big bundle of your finest straw kind Sir. I'll use it to build my own house!”\n\nThe farmer—a little surprised by this request—happily obliged. He gave the first little Pig ten bales of his finest straw and the Pig built his straw house. The house looked sublime. There was not a single straw out of place and the little Pig was very proud of himself.\n\nA big bad Wolf—who'd been watching from afar—strolled up to the straw house, knocked at the door, and said in a low, gruff voice, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\n“Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!” replied the little Pig.\n\n“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!” said the big bad Wolf.\n\nWithout delay the Wolf took a huge breath in. Then he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in. The straw house looked wonderful, but it was extremely weak. It fell down in an instant and the big bad Wolf gobbled up the first little Pig.\n\n“Lovely.”\n\nMeanwhile, the second and third little Pigs had continued to walk down the lane to the brickyard.\n\nThey soon came across another farm. This was an apple farm and the farmer was busy chopping down the branches of the apple trees. An enormous pile of sticks lay on the ground next to the farmer.\n\nThe second Little Pig thought to herself “By golly, I’ve got it! I’ll make my house out of sticks. It'll save my tired legs from walking further and my house will be built faster!”\n\nSo the second little Pig said to the farmer, “I’d like to have that enormous pile of sticks kind Sir. I will use it to build my house!”\n\nThe farmer—who was looking for a way to get rid of his sticks—happily obliged. He gave the second little Pig all of the sticks and the Pig built her stick house. The house looked fabulous. There was not a single stick out of place and the little Pig was very proud of herself.\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf—fresh from gobbling the first little Pig—strolled up to the stick house, knocked at the door, and said in a low and gruff voice, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\n“Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!” replied the second little Pig.\n\n“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!” said the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nWithout delay the Big Bad Wolf took a huge breath in. Then he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in. The stick house looked superb, but it too was extremely weak. It fell down in an instant and the Big Bad Wolf gobbled up the second little Pig.\n\n“Yummy-yummy-yummy.”\n\nMeanwhile, the third little Pig had made it all the way to the brickyard. He went up to the man in charge of the yard and said “Hello kind Sir, I would like a large pile of your bricks to build my house.”\n\nThe man—who, as it turned out, was extremely generous—happily obliged. He gave the third little Pig all the bricks he wanted and the Pig built his brick house. The house not only looked tremendous, it was extremely strong. The third little Pig had taken the time to build his house well and he was extremely proud of himself.\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf—fresh from gobbling the second little Pig—strolled up to the brick house, knocked at the door, and said in a low and gruff voice, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\n“Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!” replied the third little Pig.\n\n“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in!” said the Big Bad Wolf.\n\nWithout delay the Big Bad Wolf took a huge breath in. Then he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed, but the brick house was much too strong and well built to be blown down.\n\nThis made the Big Bad Wolf wild with rage, so he devised a nasty plot to fool the third little Pig into coming out of his brick house.\n\nTap tap tap came from the window.\n\n“Little Pig, I know a farmer with some marvelous turnips. You love turnips don’t you little Pig? Shall we go there tomorrow and get some?” said the Big Bad Wolf.\n\n“Very well,” said the little Pig, “I do love turnips. What time do you want to go?”\n\n“Seven o’clock sharp,” said the Wolf, “and don’t be late!”\n\nThe third little Pig may have been little, but he wasn't stupid. He was, after all, the little Pig that made his house from bricks—as his mother had wisely proposed. So the little Pig got up early, filled a sack full of turnips and was back in his house long before seven o’clock.\n\nWhen the Wolf arrived he said, “Little Pig, are you ready to go?”\n\n“Silly Wolf!” said the little Pig, “I’ve been. My turnips are already bubbling away in a huge pot for my dinner.”\n\n​The Wolf was incensed. He was so angry he felt sure he could have exploded, but he suddenly had a thought and pulled himself together.\n\n“Little Pig,” he said, “I know a place where there is a wonderful apple tree. You love apples don’t you little Pig.”\n\n“Oh yes, I do,” said the Pig, “Where is this wonderful tree you speak of?”\n\n“Just over the hill,” said the Wolf, “I’ll be back here at six o’clock tomorrow and we can go together to get the apples. So you had better not deceive me this time little Pig!”\n\nThe little Pig woke at five the following morning and went over the hill to the big apple tree. He had hoped to help himself before the Wolf arrived, but the Wolf was too clever for that.\n\nThe little Pig saw the Wolf approaching—which, as you can imagine, terrified him greatly—and quickly climbed the tree.\n\n“Hello, Wolf,” said the little Pig from up in the tree, “Wait there while I find the biggest, plumpest, juiciest apple for you.”\n\nThe Wolf waited.\n\nThe little Pig picked a big juicy apple, then called down, “I’ll throw it to you Wolf. Here it comes!” The Pig then threw the apple as far away as he could.\n\nAnd while the Wolf was away collecting the apple—which took quite some time—the little Pig jumped down from the tree and ran safely home to his brick house.\n\nBy now the Wolf had had enough.\n\nHe followed the little Pig home and called through the window, “Little Pig, little Pig, I am going to eat you up. I will climb on the top of your house, come down the chimney and gobble you up in a single bite!”\n\nHearing this, the little Pig quickly made a roaring fire and placed upon it a large pot full of water. As the Wolf came down the chimney the little Pig lifted the lid of the pot. The Wolf fell in with a plop—head first—and the little Pig replaced the lid quick as a flash.\n\nThe little Pig then boiled the Wolf, gobbled him up for his supper and lived happily ever after.\n\nThe End"
