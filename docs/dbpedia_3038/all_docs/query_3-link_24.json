        "text": "To watch “In the Year of the Pig,” the 1969 Vietnam War documentary by Emile de Antonio (1919-89) is to be dropped into the middle of a long-germinating and still-developing disaster.\n\nThe movie, screening this weekend in a newly restored 35-millimeter print as part of Metrograph’s current de Antonio retrospective, is not a history of the Vietnam War so much as an immersion in the ideas that were held while the war was going on.\n\n“In the Year of the Pig” (which can be found on YouTube) is also a landmark in film history. Commonplace now, the notion of a documentary without a voice-over, predicated on the juxtaposition of archival footage and contrapuntal interviews was novel in 1969 and proved highly influential."
