        "text": "“Eating the Pig,” by Donald Hall, appeared in the Winter 2018 issue of MQR, a special issue dedicated to Poetry at Michigan. The accompanying photo essay by Sarah Innes, “Forgotten Photographs from the Feast That Occasioned Donald Hall’s ‘Eating the Pig,'” featured pictures taken by her late husband, Stephen Blos, at the dinner on which the poem was based. Writes Innes:\n\nI climbed the steps to their corner apartment on a dark Sunday evening. Everybody had made an effort to dress up. The table was set with an Indian print bedspread, mismatched goblets, and tall candles. The pig was shiny and striped like a tiger, with an apple clenched in his teeth, and surrounded by fruit stuffing…\n\nThese photographs (and more) are now on view at Hatcher Graduate Library until October 7, 2018 as part of its “Eating The Pig: A Dinner Party in Poetry, Photography and Painting” exhibit. Curated by Sarah Innes, the exhibit previously appeared at the Ann Arbor District Library.\n\nTwelve people, most of us strangers, stand in a room\n\nin Ann Arbor, drinking Cribari from jars.\n\nThen two young men, who cooked him,\n\ncarry him to the table\n\non a large square of plywood: his body\n\nstriped, like a tiger cat’s, from the basting,\n\nhis legs long, much longer than a cat’s,\n\nand the striped hide as shiny as vinyl.\n\nNow I see his head, as he takes his place\n\nat the center of the table,\n\nhis wide pig’s head; and he looks like the javelina\n\nthat ran in front of the car, in the desert outside Tucson,\n\nand I am drawn to him, my brother the pig,\n\nwith his large ears cocked forward,\n\nwith his tight snout, with his small ferocious teeth\n\nin a jaw propped open\n\nby an apple. How bizarre, this raw apple clenched\n\nin a cooked face! Then I see his eyes,\n\nhis eyes cramped shut, his no-eyes, his eyes like X’s\n\nin a comic strip, when the character gets knocked out.\n\nThis afternoon they read directions\n\nfrom a book: The eyeballs must be removed\n\nor they will burst during roasting. So they hacked them out.\n\n“I nearly fainted,” says someone.\n\n“I never fainted before, in my whole life.”\n\nThen they gutted the pig and stuffed him,\n\nand roasted him five hours, basting the long body.\n\n* * *\n\nNow we examine him, exclaiming, and we marvel at him—\n\nbut no one picks up a knife.\n\nThen a young woman cuts off his head.\n\nIt comes off so easily, like a detachable part.\n\nWith sudden enthusiasm we dismantle the pig,\n\nwe wrench his trotters off, we twist them\n\nat shoulder and hip, and they come off so easily.\n\nThen we cut open his belly and pull the skin back.\n\nFor myself, I scoop a portion of left thigh,\n\nmoist, tender, falling apart, fat, sweet.\n\nWe forage like an army starving in winter\n\nthat crosses a pass in the hills and discovers\n\na valley of full barns—\n\ncattle fat and lowing in their stalls,\n\nbins of potatoes in root cellars under white farmhouses.\n\nbarrels of cider, onions, hens squawking over eggs—\n\nand the people nowhere, with bread still warm in the oven.\n\nMaybe, south of the valley, refugees pull their carts\n\nlistening for Stukas or elephants, carrying\n\nbedding, pans, and silk dresses,\n\nold men and women, children, deserters, young wives.\n\nNo, we are here, eating the pig together.\n\n* * *\n\nIn ten minutes, the destruction is total.\n\nHis tiny ribs, delicate as birds’ feet, lie crisscrossed.\n\nOr they are like crosshatching in a drawing,\n\nlines doubling and redoubling on each other.\n\nBits of fat and muscle\n\nmix with stuffing alien to the body,\n\nwalnuts and plums. His skin, like a parchment bag\n\nsoaked in oil, is pulled back and flattened,\n\nwith ridges and humps remaining, like a contour map,\n\nlike the map of a defeated country.\n\nThe army consumes every blade of grass in the valley,\n\nevery tree, every stream, every village,\n\nevery crossroad, every shack, every book, every graveyard.\n\nHis intact head\n\nswivels around, to view the landscape of body\n\nas if in dismay.\n\n“For sixteen weeks I lived. For sixteen weeks\n\nI took into myself nothing but the milk of my mother\n\nwho rolled on her side for me,\n\nfor my brothers and sisters. Only five hours roasting,\n\nand this body so quickly dwindles away to nothing.”\n\n* * *\n\nBy itself, isolated on this plywood,\n\namong this puzzle of foregone possibilities,\n\nhis intact head seems to want affection.\n\nWithout knowing that I will do it,\n\nI reach out and scratch his jaw,\n\nand I stroke him behind his ears,\n\nas if he might suddenly purr from his cooked head.\n\n“When I stroke your pig’s ears,\n\nand scratch the striped leather of your jowls,\n\nthe furrow between the sockets of your eyes,\n\nI take into myself, and digest,\n\nwheat that grew between\n\nthe Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.\n\n“And I take into myself the flint carving tool,\n\nand the savannah, and hairs in the tail\n\nof Eohippus, and fingers of bamboo,\n\nand Hannibal’s elephant, and Hannibal,\n\nand everything that lived before us, everything born,\n\nexalted, and dead, and historians who carved in the Old Kingdom\n\nwhen the wall had not heard about China.”\n\nI speak these words\n\ninto the ear of the Stone Age pig, the Abraham\n\npig, the ocean pig, the Achilles pig,\n\nand into the ears\n\nof the fire pig that will eat our bodies up."
