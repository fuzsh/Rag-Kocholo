        "text": "You must report movements any time pigs move on or off your holding or premises. You must do this even if you keep pigs as pets or have temporary responsibility for them.\n\nReporting movements helps contain and control the spread of disease. It’s your responsibility to follow the rules. If you do not, you could get movement restrictions on your herd, get a fine or be prosecuted.\n\nYou must also keep a holding register to record the movements.\n\nThere’s different guidance for reporting and recording pig movements if you’re a market, collection centre, showground or slaughterhouse.\n\nBefore you move pigs\n\nRead what keepers need to know about moving pigs, which includes guidance on how to register your land and register as a keeper.\n\nYou must make sure:\n\nyour pigs are correctly identified\n\nyou have a county parish holding (CPH) number for your land\n\nYou must report all pig movements using electronic animal movement licensing (eAML2). You’ll need to register the first time you use it.\n\nAfter you’ve registered, you’ll be able to set up and confirm off and on movements.\n\nYou can also view your movement history, which you can use as a holding register.\n\nIf you cannot use eAML2 to report movements online, you’ll need to call the helpline each time you want to move pigs. You’ll need to allow time for them to set up the move and send you the movement documents in the post before you can move the pigs.\n\nAfter you’ve registered, you can enter all your pig keeping details in Pig Hub - this will save your information and help fill in the movement forms.\n\nSet up a movement (‘pre-notify’)\n\nYou must set up a movement on eAML2 before you move your pigs. This is often called ‘pre-notifying’.\n\nYou do not have to set up a movement if it’s to a vet for emergency treatment.\n\nYou’ll need to:\n\nselect your farm as the ‘departure site’\n\nselect where you want to send your pigs, for example a slaughterhouse\n\nYou’ll need your holding details and CPH number, unless you’ve set up your profile in Pig Hub (these details will already be filled in).\n\nDepending on the type of move you’ll also need to record some or all of the following:\n\nyour herd mark\n\nthe total number of pigs you want to move\n\nlot numbers or individual animal identification numbers (for example, for pedigree pigs), if you have them\n\nwhere the pigs were born\n\nquestions about the pigs’ health and welfare\n\nyour transporter or haulier details\n\nthe journey details, including the date of the movement, the distance and how long the journey will last\n\nIf you cannot use eAML2 online, call the helpline.\n\nGet your movement document\n\nAfter you’ve set up your movement, you can print the movement document (sometimes referred to as a licence or haulier summary).\n\nGive the required number of copies (for example, one to the haulier and one to the receiving keeper, if they do not use eAML2) to the haulier or person transporting the pigs - the documents must travel with them.\n\nIf you set up the movement online, the eAML2 service will create a document for you, which you can print.\n\nIf you cannot use the internet or do not have a printer, call eAML2.\n\nIf you set up the movement by phone, you can choose to get the document by email or post - allow 5 days for the document to arrive.\n\nHauliers and transporters must keep a copy of the movement document for 6 months.\n\nIf the receiving keeper does not have an eAML2 account\n\nAsk the receiving keeper to call eAML2 before you move the pigs - eAML2 will register them over the phone and check that they:\n\nhave a CPH number\n\nare registered as a keeper\n\nReport (confirm) the ‘off movement’ on the day\n\nYou (the sending keeper) must confirm the off movement has happened and any changes you’ve made since you set up (pre-notified) the movement. For example, any change to the number of animals you’re moving.\n\nYou must do this within 24 hours of the pigs leaving your holding.\n\nYou can confirm the movement:\n\nonline on eAML2\n\nby calling eAML2\n\nby texting eAML2 - you must register your mobile phone number to use the text message service\n\nReport an ‘on movement’\n\nIf you’re the keeper receiving the pigs you must confirm:\n\ntheir arrival (the on movement)\n\nany changes, for example if the number of animals that arrive is different from the number notified as being sent (including if any were dead on arrival)\n\nYou can confirm the movement:\n\nonline using eAML2\n\nby calling eAML2\n\nby texting eAML2, if you’ve registered your mobile phone number with eAML2\n\nIf you do not have an eAML2 account, you should get 2 copies of the movement document from the haulier. Use these to report the move to eAML2 by phone. You must keep a copy of the document for 6 months.\n\nWhen the pigs arrive on your holding, you must follow the standstill rules if there are livestock on your holding.\n\nIt’s against the law to send pigs without movement documents, so you should not receive pigs without movement documents.\n\nMove pigs to and from a market or collection centre\n\nOn eAML2, select the ‘to a market or collection centre’ option. Choose the destination market or collection centre from the drop-down list.\n\nThen follow the same process to set up a movement and confirm the movement on the day.\n\nFill in a paper movement document and send it with your pigs. You can get paper documents from a market or print a copy of the farm to market template from the eAML2 website.\n\nOn the day of the move, the market will use eAML2 to:\n\nrecord the movement from your holding\n\nreport the on movement to the market or collection centre\n\nOccasionally, you may not have to set up a movement to the market if they agree to do it for you.\n\nThis might be necessary if, for example, the market asks you on the day of a sale if you have any pigs ready to sell so that they can meet their buyers’ demand.\n\nIf this happens, the market must report the whole movement - off your holding and on to theirs - on the same day the pigs arrive.\n\nMovements from a market\n\nAs a farmer, keeper or buyer, you do not have to set up (pre-notify) a movement when:\n\nyou buy pigs from a market\n\nif you take them back to your holding\n\nThe market will do this for you in eAML2 and give the haulier movement document copies.\n\nYou’ll need to confirm the pigs’ arrival at your holding - this should be the same as stated on the movement document. If the pigs were moved to a different destination you must make sure that is corrected on eAML2.\n\nMove pigs to and from a showground\n\nOn eAML2, select the ‘to a show’ option and choose the show you want to take your pigs to from the drop-down list.\n\nYou’ll need to include:\n\nthe number of pigs you’re moving\n\neach pig’s herd mark and individual identification numbers\n\nYou’ll then be prompted to set up the post-show movement either:\n\nback to your holding\n\nto a different place if the pig is not coming back to your holding - for example because you’ve already agreed to sell to another keeper, or it will be going to a different holding for breeding\n\nIf the pigs come back to your holding, log in to eAML2 and confirm the movement.\n\nWhen you sell pigs at a show\n\nIf you’re planning on selling pigs at the show and you do not already have a buyer, you must also print a ‘show sales form’. You’ll get this after you’ve set up the movement to the show in eAML2.\n\nTake this with you and give it to the new keeper, who’ll use it to confirm the movement on to their holding. Include the movement reference number, if you know who will be buying from you at the show.\n\nWhen you buy pigs at a show\n\nLog in to eAML2 and enter the movement reference number on the show sales form. You can then check the details and confirm the movement on to your holding.\n\nMoving pigs for exhibition or performance reasons (‘special destination’ moves)\n\nYou might want to move pigs to non-agricultural locations that do not have a CPH number, such as:\n\na school or other education facility\n\na TV studio\n\nother venues for performance-related activities\n\nTo report the movement, select ‘to a performance location’ on eAML2.\n\nThis will allow you to move the pigs to a destination without a CPH number. You can set up new destinations as you need to.\n\nYou’ll need to confirm the off and on movement on the same day - you’ll be prompted to set up the return movement.\n\nYou’ll need to apply to APHA for a permit to ‘disapply the standstill’ so that the standstill rule does not apply at the location and when the pigs return to your holding.\n\nContact APHA.\n\nA condition of that permit is that they’re the only animals involved at the event.\n\nIf there are animals from other keepers involved, the venue becomes a ‘gathering’ and will need an animal gathering licence.\n\nMove pigs to a slaughterhouse\n\nOn eAML2, select the ‘to an abattoir’ option and choose where you want to move the pigs. Then follow the same process for setting up an off movement and confirm the off movement on the day.\n\nThe slaughterhouse will confirm the on movement on to their premises.\n\nImport and export movements\n\nUse eAML2 to report imported pig movements and set up export movements.\n\nFor imported pigs, report the movement on to your holding on eAML2. You’ll need the relevant details on the import health certificate that should arrive with the pigs, such as:\n\nwhere the animal arrived in England, for example the port details\n\nthe haulier details\n\nthe herd mark and any individual identification numbers from their country of origin\n\nthe total number of pigs\n\nthe type of pigs\n\nfood chain information, if you have it\n\nTo set up an export movement, you’ll need to get an export health certificate to send with the pigs. The you can set up the export movement on eAML2. To set up an export movement, you’ll need to get an export health certificate to send with the pigs.\n\nMake sure that the pigs are correctly identified with ear tags, ear tattoos or slap marks.\n\nThere are other rules to follow when you:\n\nimport livestock into Great Britain\n\nexport livestock from Great Britain\n\nGet help or advice"
