        "text": "Sign of the Chinese zodiac\n\n\"Year of the pig\" redirects here. For the Doctor Who audio play, see Year of the Pig. For the U.S. documentary film about the Vietnam War, see In the Year of the Pig.\n\nPigTraditional Chinese豬Simplified Chinese猪\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinzhūWade–Gileschu1IPA[ʈʂú]HakkaRomanizationchûYue: CantoneseYale RomanizationjyūJyutpingzyu1IPA[tsy˥]Southern MinHokkien POJtiOld ChineseBaxter–Sagart (2014)*tra\n\nThe Pig (豬) or sometimes translated as the Boar is the twelfth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in Chinese zodiac, in relation to the Chinese calendar and system of horology, and paralleling the system of ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. Although the term \"zodiac\" (etymologically referring to a \"[circle of] little animals\") is used in the phrase \"Chinese zodiac\", there is a major difference between the Chinese usage and Western astrology: the zodiacal animals (including the zodiacal Pig) do not relate to the zodiac as the area of the sky that extends approximately 8° north or south (as measured in celestial latitude) of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, the Moon, and visible planets across the celestial sphere's constellations, over the course of the year.[clarification needed]\n\nIn Chinese astrology, \"zodiacal\" animals refer to fixed cycles of twelve animals. The same cycle of twelve is used for cycles of years and cycles of hours. In the case of years, the cycle of twelve corresponds to the twelve-year cycle of Jupiter. In the case of the hours, the twelve hours represent twelve double-hours for each period of night and day. In the continuous sexagenary cycle of sixty years, every twelfth year corresponds to hai, 亥 (the twelfth of the twelve Earthly Branches); this re-recurring twelfth year is commonly called the Year of the Pig (豬年).\n\nThere are five types of Pigs, named after the Chinese elements. In order, they are: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. These correspond to the Heavenly Stems. Thus, there are five pig years in every sexagenary cycle. For example, in the year 2019, the Earthly Branch is the twelfth, hài, and the Heavenly Stem is the sixth, jǐ 己. The Chinese New Year in 2019 is February fifth: this corresponds with the beginning of both the sexegenary year of jǐ hài and also the zodiac year of the Earth Pig.\n\nIn the Japanese zodiac[1] and the Tibetan zodiac,[2] the Pig is referred to as the boar. In the Dai zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the elephant.[3] In the Gurung zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the deer.[4] The Malay zodiac replaces the Pig with the tortoise.[5]\n\nPig in the Chinese zodiac legend\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the myths, the Pig was the last to arrive when the Jade Emperor called for the great meeting. Other sources said that Buddha called for a great meeting when he was about to leave the Earth. The Pig arrived last.\n\nYet another legend has it that The Emperor organized a race to ascertain the order of the animals in the Zodiac. The pig not having arrived long after all of the other animals, he was about to call it a day when an oink and squeal were heard. The term \"lazy pig\" comes from this incident; the Pig had become hungry during the race, stopped for a feast, and then promptly fell asleep. The pig finally completed the race, however, and was accordingly named the 12th and last animal of the zodiac cycle.[6]\n\nOther sources say that given his very stout form, he was just too slow a swimmer, and thus he could not do anything against the other animals (or conversely that he was so fast he went up the wrong side of the river first). [citation needed]\n\nYears and the Five Elements\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Pig and the Elements\n\n[edit]\n\nThe natural element of the Pig is Water. Thus, it is commonly associated with emotions and intuitions. Yet, given that along with the elements (called the Celestial stem), the animal zodiac (called the Earthly stem) also follows a cycle, each of the elements affect the characteristic of the same Earthly stem (see Sexagenary cycle).\n\nHowever, the Pig is yin, and thus only the negative aspects of the elements can be attached to them, thus only 5 kinds of Pigs are found in the zodiac. They are the following:\n\n乙亥 (yǐhài) – The Wood Pig\n\n丁亥 (dīnghài) – The Fire Pig\n\n己亥 (jǐhài) – The Earth Pig\n\n辛亥 (xīnhài) – The Metal Pig\n\n癸亥 (guǐhài) – The Water Pig\n\nThe Years of the Pig\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople born within these date ranges can be said to have been born in the \"Year of the Pig\", while bearing the following elemental sign:\n\nStart date End date Heavenly Branch 4 February 1935 23 January 1936 Wood Pig 22 January 1947 9 February 1948 Fire Pig 8 February 1959 27 January 1960 Earth Pig 27 January 1971 14 February 1972 Metal Pig 13 February 1983 1 February 1984 Water Pig 31 January 1995 18 February 1996 Wood Pig 18 February 2007 6 February 2008 Fire Pig 5 February 2019 24 January 2020 Earth Pig 23 January 2031 10 February 2032 Metal Pig 10 February 2043 29 January 2044 Water Pig 28 January 2055 14 February 2056 Wood Pig 14 February 2067 2 February 2068 Fire Pig 2 February 2079 21 January 2080 Earth Pig 18 February 2091 6 February 2092 Metal Pig 4 February 2103 28 January 2104 Water Pig\n\nHour of the Pig\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Hour Of The Pig\" redirects here. For the movie, see The Hour of the Pig.\n\nSimilarly to the usage of the traditional Japanese clock, each day-night period was divided into 12 double-hours, each of which corresponding with one of the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, with similar symbolic motif and astrological significance. The first of the twelve double hours (the Hour of the Rat) encompasses midnight, at the middle of the double hour, corresponding with 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., with midnight being the midpoint of the first double-hour. The animals in the hourly sequence are the same and in the same order as in the yearly sequence. The Pig is the last in the sequence, with the Hour of the Pig corresponding to the double-hour 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., also known as the hour hai (亥). [7]\n\nGiven that the traditional Chinese day-night cycle was composed of 12 hours, each sign is given to the different signs of the zodiac. The Pig is assigned to govern the time between 21:00 hrs to 22:59 hrs. According to tradition, this is the time when the Pig is doing what it does best (sleeping and enjoying the sweet life).\n\nIn terms of astrology, the hours in which people were born (technically termed as the Ascendant) are the second most important facet of their astrology. Thus, this alters greatly the characteristics. Even if people were born in any year governed by another animal (for example, anyone born on 20 December 2000, i.e. year of the Dragon) will display strong characteristics of the Pig. Thus, they may be fierce and strong like the Dragon, but at the same time emotional and intuitive like the Pig.\n\nBasic astrology elements\n\n[edit]\n\nEarthly Branches of Birth Year: 亥 Hai The Five Elements: Water The Five Planets: Mercury Cardinal Point: North-Northwest (NNW) Yin/ Yang: Yin Lunar Month: Tenth House: XI The karma and unconscious Earthly Branch Ruling Hours: 21:00 to 22:59 Twelve Heavenly Generals: Sanskrit: Kiṃbhīra (Hanzi: 宮毘羅) Lucky Flowers: lily Lucky Numbers: 2, 5, 6, 8; Avoid: 3, 4, 9 Lucky Colors: yellow; Avoid: red, blue\n\nCultural notes\n\n[edit]\n\nSome Chinese Muslims will say that they were born in the year of the hai, 亥 (twelfth and final year of the zodiac) to avoid saying the \"Pig\".[8] This is because pigs are haram (forbidden to eat) in Islam and therefore Muslims consider pigs unclean.\n\nIncreasing numbers of countries and regions now issue lunar new year stamps. For the 2019 Year of the Pig, the USC U.S.-China Institute collected stamps from 56 jurisdictions.[9]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChinese astrology\n\nChinese calendar correspondence table\n\nTraditional Chinese timekeeping\n\nBurmese zodiac\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nNeil Somerville (2006).
