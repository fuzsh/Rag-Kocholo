        "text": "I’ve had a strangely double-sided reaction to this one.\n\nIn The Year Of The Pig is a sort of found-footage documentary, an assortment of newsreels and interviews assembled by filmmaker Emile de Antonio to give some context to the complicated origins of the Vietnam War. It’s a parade of newsreels and interviews with foreign policy experts and military analysts, starting from as early as the late 1940s; chronicling first American feelings on the French/Indochinese War, moving on to CIA attempts to shore up Điện Biên Phủ, and then the growing American involvement in Vietnam – starting in the mid-1950s and spurred on by fears of Communism, marching inevitably over the ensuing decade to the point where young American men are being shipped overseas to fight in a war that effectively started when they were children.\n\nMost of the footage is simply clips of interviews, sometimes juxtaposed with scenes from the then-current Vietnam War (including footage of the self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức and a newsreel of US Marines cavorting on a South Vietnamese beach). There’s no narration, it’s just this parade of clips, pulled out from their various time frames and assembled together.\n\nIntellectually I’ve been fascinated by the range of different reactions generated by de Antonio’s approach. I’ve found some supportive reviews, both contemporary and recent; and I’ve found some heavily critical reviews as well, accusing de Antonio of being classist and a Marxist in his approach.\n\nAnd, well, they’re not wrong; de Antonio did indeed lead left, so to speak. But I can’t think of any example of any possible missing interview that would have justified the war – especially since the film is already full of such interviews, all from American journalists and pundits and statesmen expressing support for our efforts to Sort Things Out in Vietnam, only for things to later go wrong.\n\nAnd that leads to my other reaction. I didn’t come away from this film thinking that this was Communist agit-prop – as its detractors have argued – rather, I came away from this horrified at how little it seemed that our state department knew about Vietnam, and how shallow its understanding was of the nation’s internal affairs – and how much harm we still caused nevertheless, through our own ignorance. We didn’t lose in Vietnam because because of Communist agitprop – we lost in Vietnam simply because we had no idea what we were doing. We were looking at a very complex international incident through a very narrow filter, and trying to help the people of Vietnam based on that narrow filter. It’s no wonder we got things so wrong – and that tragedy is what affected me most."
