        "text": "The Revivalists, Muscadine Bloodline, The Cadillac Three and Greylan James Round Out the Lineup\n\nTampa, Fla. – (April 22, 2024) – Tampa Bay’s premier philanthropic community event, the Tampa Pig Jig, will welcome three-time CMA-Award-winning superstar Dierks Bentley to Julian B. Lane Park on Saturday, October 19. American rock band The Revivalists, southern country duo Muscadine Bloodline, ACM-nominated band The Cadillac Three, and young breakout Country star Greylan James, round out the all-star lineup. The event, presented by RIPA, Valley Bank, and Baldwin Risk Partners, donates proceeds to NephCure, supporting its mission to find treatment and a cure for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Nephrotic Syndrome. The Tampa Pig Jig, named Best Charity Event by Tampa Magazine, has become a favorite fall event, combining live music, games, a silent auction, and delicious food and drinks into one fun-filled day.\n\nA group of local men founded the Tampa Pig Jig to support their friend fighting against FSGS, a rare kidney disease. Kidney disease affects more than 1 in 7 adults in the U.S., and Nephrotic Syndrome, which includes FSGS, is one of the most severe and debilitating forms. Currently, there is no cure. Since its inception, the Tampa Pig Jig has helped NephCure increase funding for critical research, growing from just three clinical trials in 2011 to over 60 now underway. As it enters its thirteenth year, the nonprofit event has raised more than $7 million and inspired events in San Jose (Silicon Valley Pig Jig), Colorado Springs (Rocky Mountain Pig Jig), and Staten Island (Staten Island Pig Jig).\n\nDierks Bentley released his 10th studio album, GRAVEL & GOLD, in 2023, again “proving why he’s one of Country’s biggest stars” (TODAY), whose unique 21st-century career has had a rare consistency fueled by longevity. He landed his first publishing deal in 2001 and released his debut album in 2003, producing an instant number-one single. In the two decades since, Bentley has achieved success with eight more albums that reached the top of the Country sales charts, resulting in 22 No. One songs, eight billion streams, three CMA Awards, 15 GRAMMY® nominations, and membership into the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nEight-piece rock ‘n’ roll collective The Revivalists have made the journey from hole-in-the-wall gigs to sold-out shows at hallowed venues, multi-platinum success, more than 800 million streams, and major media praise. Their fifth album, Pour It Out Into The Night (Concord Records), is a life-affirming album about living in the moment, fueled by lessons in gratitude and life realizations. Renowned for their live prowess, soulful alt-rock anthems, a distinct mix of many of the classic styles of American music, and outward generosity through their philanthropic Rev Causes initiative, The Revivalists broke through with 2015’s Men Amongst Mountains, which featured the double-platinum smash single and Billboard Hot 100 hit “Wish I Knew You.”\n\nProudly independent and unapologetically Southern, country duo Muscadine Bloodline found their true voice on their latest album, Dispatch to 16th Ave. Their sophomore record debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Country Chart, hit No. 4 on the iTunes All Genre Chart and peaked at No. 17 on the Billboard Chart. Lauded by Taste of Country, Rolling Stone, PEOPLE and Billboard, the duo’s new music is the most authentic Muscadine Bloodline yet. Since 2015, the Mobile, Alabama natives have charted three albums, sold out shows across the country and played the Grand Ole Opry multiple times, hailed often as the most successful independent duo in Country music.\n\nWith more than a decade of making records and touring to their credit, The Cadillac Three continues to push boundaries with their self-branded “CountryFuzz” sound, a singular mixture of Country music storytelling and rock ‘n’ roll musicianship. Composed of three Nashville natives who became friends in high school, the group features singer-guitarist Jaren Johnston, drummer Neil Mason, and steel player Kelby Ray, who does double duty on bass. Over the course of TC3’s six studio albums, they’ve garnered ACM and CMA International Achievement nominations.\n\nFrom the moment his Papaw gifted him his first guitar at the age of five, one of Nashville’s most exciting young breakout Country stars, Greylan James, knew he was meant to be a musician. The Knoxville-raised singer/songwriter has quickly become a “celebrated songwriter” (Country Now) since moving to Music City, earning cuts from some of Country music’s most notable artists, including Kenny Chesney (“Happy Does”), Chris Young (“If That Ain’t God”), Chris Janson (“Real Friends” feat Blake Shelton), Cole Swindell (“How Is She”), Bailey Zimmerman (“Get to Gettin’ Gone”) and more. To date, Greylan’s songbook has amassed more than 650 million streams. His first No. 1 with Jordan Davis’ smash hit “Next Thing You Know” earned him nominations for Song Of The Year from the CMA and ACM Awards, respectively. Greylan’s debut single “Young Man” is out now.\n\nTickets for the 2024 Tampa Pig Jig go on sale this Friday, April 26, at 10 a.m. Fans can enjoy early bird pricing of $130, which includes entry into the Tampa Pig Jig, access to the main lawn, game areas, and food row vendors.
