And why is that pig licking his lips?\n\nThe Day the Pig Ate Keith, a fictional mystery tale based on a true event as seen from the point-of-view of an eight-year-old, is guaranteed to make you chuckle!\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBrenda Jordan Strickland is the third oldest child in a family with twelve children. She and her family often reminisce about the “good old days,” and still laugh about the day the pig ate Keith, when young Brenda was convinced a pig had, indeed, eaten her brother!\n\nGrowing up on the farm left Brenda and her family with many fond memories and opportunities to laugh. They are blessed to have all fourteen family members alive and doing well—and their family is growing, with spouses, children, and grandchildren! Love continues to bind them together."
