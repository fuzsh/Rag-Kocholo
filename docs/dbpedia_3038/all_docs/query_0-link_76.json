        "text": "Well-respectedEvery other animal is willing to go out of their way to hear Old Major's speech.[Old Major] was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.It is clear that the others respect Old Major. So much so that they will even lose some sleep to hear his thoughts. Rest time must have been very precious during Mr Jones' rule.Good speakerDuring his speech, Old Major uses a range linguistic techniques such as part of rhetoric to persuade and inspire the other animals.\"Why then do we continue in this miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer to all our problems.\"Old Major persuades the animals that he is right by using emotive words like 'miserable' to pull on the animals' heartstrings. He also uses questions and inclusive pronouns like 'comrades' and 'our' to involve them in his ideas."
