        "text": "Meaning: To refuse to acknowledge a known truth\n\nExample: I’ll turn a blind eye once, but next time you’ll be in trouble.\n\nOrigin: While many proposed origins of this phrase are disputed, it is commonly accepted that turning a blind eye comes from a comment made by British Admiral Horatio Nelson. In 1801 he led the attack alongside Admiral Sir Hyde Parker in the Battle of Copenhagen. Nelson was blind in one eye. Parker communicated to Nelson at one point, via flags, that he needed to retreat and disengage. Nelson, however, was convinced that he could prevail if they pushed onward. Nelson then, holding the telescope to his blind eye, pretended not to see the signal—making a sly comment to a fellow officer about reserving the right to use his blind eye every now and again.\n\nMeaning: To reprimand someone for behaving badly, with the intention of improving that person’s behavior\n\nExample: Taylor was being too loud in class, so I read her the riot act.\n\nOrigin: This idiom most likely comes from the real Riot Act, an act passed by the British government in 1714 to prevent unruly assemblies. In the 18th century King George I and the government were fearful of being overthrown by supporters of the previous Stuart dynasty. If crowds of more than 12 assembled, authorities could read them a portion of the Riot Act, upon which they must leave or be imprisoned. Thus, if someone is behaving in a manner that we find inappropriate, we “read them the riot act,” intending to get the unruly person to stop what they’re doing.\n\nMeaning: Depending on who you ask, you’ll actually find an array of definitions for this odd idiom. Here are some of the most commonly used definitions:\n\n1. There is evidence to back up a previously made claim, specifically evidence intrinsic to the object in question. (Example: Of course this project will be successful, the proof is in the pudding.)\n\n2. The process of achieving something isn’t important as long as the end product is good. (Example: I may have had to walk 1,000 miles to find this treasure, but the proof is in the pudding.)\n\n3. The success of something can only be measured by putting it to its intended use. (Example: You’ll have to try it out before you buy it, since the proof is in the pudding.)\n\nOrigin: The reason for the plethora of definitions is most likely the Americanization of the old British idiom, which reads “the proof of the pudding is in the eating.” Whereas the British version makes at least some sense, the shortened American version is nonsensical. This led to the varied use of the idiom in a multitude of situations, with varying understandings of the definition. The British version, however, is closest in definition to the third listed above. The word proof was synonymous to test in the 16th century, which is when this idiom is thought to have surfaced. Pudding was also far different from today. It was most likely a minced-meat dish. Therefore, the true test of the success of a pudding dish is in how it tastes, not any ornamentation or appearance. More generally, the success of something can be measured only by putting it to its intended purpose. It is unknown where the more American definitions came from, though they are used very commonly.\n\nMeaning: Secured success\n\nExample: I’m not even worried about the interview. I’ve got it in the bag.\n\nOrigin: Although there are other recorded uses, the version of this idiom that has become so widely accepted came about thanks to the old New York Giants (now San Francisco Giants) baseball team. It began as a superstition. In 1916 the Giants had a run of 26 consecutive wins. A bag filled with 72 extra baseballs would be put on the playing field at the beginning of each game. These balls were used to replace any that were hit into the seats or any that became too dirty. The Giants, during this crazy winning streak, fell under the impression that if they were in the lead during the ninth (last) inning, carrying the ball bag off the field would ensure their win because, according to the team, they had captured the game in the bag."
