        "text": "Mark Twain? Robert Heinlein? Paul Dickson? Anonymous?\n\nDear Quote Investigator: Teaching a pig to sing is a futile task that aggravates the porcine student according to a popular saying. Luminary Mark Twain and science fiction author Robert Heinlein have received credit for this adage. Would you please determine the accurate ascription and the original context?\n\nQuote Investigator: In 1973 Robert Heinlein published “Time Enough for Love” featuring a main character, Lazarus Long, who appeared in several other novels by the author. Long was a colorful individualist who had been genetically selected to live for centuries. He delivered the adage during a discussion of avarice and deceit. Emphasis added to excerpts by QI:\n\nI have never swindled a man. At most I kept quiet and let him swindle himself. This does no harm, as a fool cannot be protected from his folly. If you attempt to do so, you will not only arouse his animosity but also you will be attempting to deprive him of whatever benefit he is capable of deriving from experience. Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig.\n\nThus, the context was the difficulty and pointlessness of communicating a lesson that an individual is unwilling or unready to learn.\n\nThe implausible ascription to Mark Twain occurred in recent decades and is unsupported.\n\nA different saying with a distinct meaning is sometimes confused with this adage. QI has a separate article on this topic: Never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty and the pig likes it.\n\nBelow are additional selected citations in chronological order.\n\nIn 1809 a precursor with a musical instrument appeared in “The Gentleman’s Magazine” where it was described as more than two thousand years old:\n\nWhen the Greeks meant to say that a man was absurdly, foolishly, or improperly employed, they used to say,\n\n“He ploughs the air;\n\n. . .\n\nHe is making clothes for fishes;\n\nHe is teaching an old woman to dance;\n\nHe is teaching a pig to play on a flute;\n\nHe catches the wind with a net;\n\nA thematically germane citation appeared in a Waterford, Ireland newspaper in 1866. The task of teaching a pig to sing, dance, and whistle was included in the lyrics of a comical Irish ballad as an example of an absurd enterprise:\n\nYou may catch old birds with chaff.\n\nSays the Shan van Vocht,\n\nYou may coax a cow to laugh,\n\nSays the Shan van Vocht,\n\nYou may teach a pig to sing,\n\nTo dance a “Hieland fling.”\n\nOr whistle any thing.\n\nSays the Shan van Vocht.\n\nIn 1877 the London humor magazine “Punch” published a parody of a popular adventure book titled “A Ride to Khiva” by Frederick Burnaby. The parody was titled “Diary of My Ride to Khiva”, and the author was unidentified. During one satirical episode a “learned pig” was distracted and irritated by a singing mouse:\n\nSlight jealousy between the Learned Pig and the Musical Mouse. Whenever the Pig begins to practise with his letters (as he has to do every day), the Musical Mouse begins to whistle and sing, just to put him out, and make him wild. This annoys the Pig, who spells things wrong, and doesn’t answer questions properly. Consequently, I am obliged to beat the Pig. Whereupon he grunts piteously, and spells out, “Cuss that Mouse!” If I could only smooth matters over, and bring them together, it would be a fortune!\n\nIn 1889 “The Salt-Cellars: Being a Collection of Proverbs Together with Homely Notes Theron” by Charles Haddon Spurgeon included the following entry:\n\nThere’s no profit in teaching a pig to play the flute.\n\nEven if the pupil could learn, others would do the business better. There are persons who have no capacity for learning a certain art, and teaching it to them would be lost labour.\n\nIn 1900 teaching musical skills to crows or pigs was depicted as a dubious undertaking:\n\nCurtiss asked him what he would charge for teaching the crows how to sing melodiously. He burst out laughing. “Why I’d as soon expect to teach a pig to squeal in tune as to teach a crow to sing. They have absolutely no ear at all.”\n\nIn 1914 a columnist in “The Pittsburgh Gazette Times” of Pennsylvania presented the goal of teaching a pig to sing opera as an instance of an outlandish impractical objective:\n\nI suppose it is possible to teach a pig to sing grand opera—or something that you could pretend he meant for grand opera—if you wanted to take the time and the patience to do it.\n\nBut why?\n\nIn 1973 Robert Heinlein published the modern adage as noted previously:\n\nNever attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig.\n\nIn 1978 the saying was printed on an illustrated poster that a college student sent to his mother. No ascription was provided:\n\nAfter my wife visited my son’s room at college, and made the usual motherly remarks about his tidiness, she received a memorable poster for her kitchen bulletin board. The poster displayed a pig sitting comfortably in its native habitat. The message at the bottom of the poster read:\n\n“Never try to teach a pig to sing.\n\n“It wastes your time and it annoys the pig.”\n\nIn 1980 Paul Dickson included the saying in a compilation titled “The Official Explanations”. He acknowledged “MBA Magazine” as the source:\n\nBusiness Maxims. Signs, real and imagined, that belong on the walls of the nation’s offices . . .\n\nNever Try to Teach a Pig to Sing; It Wastes Your Time and It Annoys the Pig\n\nBy 1986 the saying had been reassigned to a well-known quotation magnet within the pages of a self-help book titled “One Minute Messages”:\n\nMark Twain said, “Don’t try and teach a pig to sing. It’s a waste of your time, and it annoys the pig.”\n\nIn 1987 a medical columnist in a Texas newspaper shared a variant using the word “irritate” instead of “annoy”:\n\nAvoid giving advice. An East Texas proverb states, “Don’t try to teach a pig to sing, it will irritate the pig and frustrate you.”\n\nIn 1997 “The Friars Club Encyclopedia of Jokes” credited Dickson:\n\nNever try to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and it annoys the pig.\n\nPaul Dickson\n\nThe valuable 2012 reference “The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs” has an entry on this topic that lists the Heinlein citation.\n\nIn conclusion, Robert Heinlein should be credited with the statement he published in his novel “Time Enough for Love” in 1973. The linkage to Mark Twain is spurious.\n\n(Great thanks to Mededitor and RaPUNzel whose inquiries led QI to create this entry about singing pigs in conjunction with the previous entry about wrestling pigs. Great thanks to David K. Barnhart who noted that “To teach a pig to play on a flute” was in Farmer and Henley’s opus on slang. In addition, thanks to discussants James A. Landau and Peter Reitan.)\n\nUpdate History: On July 20, 2017 citation dated 1809 and 1889 were added."
