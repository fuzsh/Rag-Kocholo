        "text": "At some point this Saturday for an hour, in the time before the sun rises, I’ll be sitting around a campfire, nursing either a late-night beer or an early-morning cup of coffee, standing guard over a roughly 180-pound pig slowly roasting.\n\nI’ll have two pig-roasting duties: Make sure the fire below the pig doesn’t go out and that the pig doesn’t catch fire. That’s about it when it comes to pig watching. Oh, there are other intricacies in the matter of pig roasting, but keeping the fire below the pig slowly burning while not allowing that same fire to set the pig ablaze are the two most important jobs.\n\nMy pig-watching duties arise because this weekend marks a Mississippi writer friend’s annual pig roast at his renovated, former plantation house in central Mississippi. The event kicks off Friday afternoon when the pig is prepared for its fiery bath and then placed into the makeshift smoker of cinder blocks and tin. Once the pig is over the fire, the pig stays there for about 24 hours. Every hour or so, a tin door is lifted, and the fire is checked, but one can approximate the condition of the fire and pig by the amount of smoke escaping through the fissures in the tin roof of the smoker. Too much smoke — and especially flames — and there’s a problem. Too little smoke — and especially no smoke — and there’s a problem.\n\nA pig roasting for 24 hours needs people watching it for 24 hours. Even in the predawn hours. This is where the tradition of pig-watching duty comes into play. My writer friend has hosted this annual Saturday pig eating at his rural Mississippi spread for years, and each year the people who arrive for the event Friday afternoon and evening are given pig-watching duty — at least for one hour during the 24-hour period. The case used to be that people drew for their time slot. Since there’s a small party going Friday night until around 2 or 3 in the morning, drawing pig-watching duty during these times was not too rough. The party is going, and people are awake and lively. The times to avoid were the early-morning hours. Four or 5 o’clock in the morning. By that time, the party was over for the night and you were alone with a dying campfire and a quite dead pig. Draw that time and there were two options: Drink all night long and power through, or head to bed early and arise before the crack of dawn. (I once pulled a 5 a.m. shift. I powered through.)\n\nIn the past few years, pig-watching duties have changed. People sign up for the times they want, with the heartier souls selecting the hours before daybreak. This way some unfortunate person without the resolve for predawn pig-watching duty doesn’t draw 5 a.m. and sleep in, forcing others to check on the pig. It’s serious business, this pig-watching duty. No one wants to be the person on duty who allowed the fire to extinguish or the pig to go ablaze. Both have happened in the past. (After dawn Saturday, the pig is in good hands as people arrive throughout the day for the big reveal.)\n\nBy Saturday evening around 7, the pig is cooked, butchered and served to about a hundred people, and this is the real significance of the annual pig roast. The event is less about the pig and more about the social. The pig roasting becomes this hub for a great gathering of people. Morrocan rug dealers, auto mechanics, Vanity Fair writers, U.S. Forest Service employees, bankers, former Jeopardy contestants, Notre Dame professors, political opposition researchers, retirees and foreigners (even Yankees), Southerners and Mississippians of all stripes gather for the event. Vegetarians, too, as there’s a grill with veggie burgers, hamburgers and hot dogs for those misguided souls who don’t enjoy roasted pig. Beer is consumed. Whiskey and tequila shots choked down. Old friends meet again. Music is played, and every soul is content.\n\nThe pig roast is one of those things that re-enforces that all in life is grand. That is, as long as the pig doesn’t catch fire and the fire doesn’t burn out."
