Landon, Thruston B. Morton, Paul Mus, Charlton Osburn, Harrison Salisbury, Ilya Todd, John Toller, David K. Tuck, David Wurfel and John White.[7][11]\n\nProduced during the Vietnam War, the film was greeted with hostility by many audiences, with bomb threats and vandalism directed at theaters that showed it.[12][13] When confronted with the charge that In the Year of the Pig had a leftist perspective, de Antonio conceded the point, replying: “Only God is objective, and he doesn’t make films.”[14]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Year of the Pig was released as a region 1 DVD in 2005. In addition to the film, the DVD has audio commentary with director Emile de Antonio composed from archival sources, an interview with de Antonio, and liner notes by de Antonio scholar Douglas Kellner.[15]\n\nInfluences\n\n[edit]\n\nA still photograph used in the film that displayed Marine Corporal Michael Wynn later was incorporated into the album cover for The Smiths' second album Meat Is Murder (1985). The insignia on Wynn's helmet was changed to \"meat is murder\".[16][17]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHearts and Minds, the Oscar-winning 1974 documentary film by Peter Davis\n\nModernist film\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSchwartzman, Theresa. 2004.
