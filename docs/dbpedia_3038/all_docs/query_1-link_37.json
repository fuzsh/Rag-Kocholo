Though he knew his partner Derek wouldn't be enthusiastic, he agreed to take the adorable little pig anyway, thinking he could care for her himself. Little did he know, that decision would change his and Derek's lives forever.\n\nIt turned out there was nothing \"micro\" about Esther, and Steve and Derek had actually signed on to raise a full-sized commercial pig. Within three years, tiny Esther grew to a whopping 600 pounds. After some real growing pains, and a lot of pig-sized messes, it became clear that Esther needed much more space, so Steve and Derek made another life-changing decision: they bought a farm and opened Happily Ever Esther Farm Sanctuary, where they could care for Esther and other animals in need.\n\nRead more --->\n\nNot so little anymore . . ."
