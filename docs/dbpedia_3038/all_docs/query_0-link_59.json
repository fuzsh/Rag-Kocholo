        "text": "Hi all,\n\nmajor problem: I'm trying to translate a number of comic strips into italian but as I am not an english mothertongue I am at a loss to understand the actual meaning of some expressions - therefore I can't even attempt to give an understandable version to my readers. Any help would be most appreciated\n\nThis guy is a gold hunter, the comic strip describes all the cliches of such endeavour (\"Funny hat? Check. Adventurous lifestile? Check. Romanticized icon of book and films? Check - and so forth) and he says:\n\n\"S'why ain't there no dagnabbed, doggone, dad blasted, two-bit, side windin', confounded, cotton-pickin', talk like a prospector day?\"\n\nAnswer: \"I think you have been hornswoggled, compadre\"\n\nAnswers back: \"Durn tootin' \"\n\n...help...\n\nThanks a million\n\nQ.\n\nps: the comic is american.\n\nHi Q.\n\nThis is not going to be easy to translate! These are slang expressions that are stereotypically western; the west of old movies and stories! There used to be a show called the Beverley Hillbillies, where some country people moved a big city. The show made fun of the poor counrty people (and their rich neighbors too), anyway, the characters on that show used expressions like this. I don't know anyone in real life who has ever said dagnabbed but somewhere in my pop-culture education I learned the meaning.\n\ndagnabbed = damned\n\ndoggnone = damned\n\ndad blasted = damned\n\ntwo bit = worthless (bits were money... two bits = not much money)\n\nside winding = damned (sneaky like a snake which travels by winding on its side)\n\ntalk-like-a-prospector day= The day is dedicated to talking like prospector and using these expressions all day( as opposed to valentines day, veterans day, independence day etc...\n\nhornswaggled = trick, disappointed, let down\n\ndurn tootin = absolutely right\n\nWhat's funny is the use of all of that old slang at once. (well, personally, I don't think it's so funny, but that''s the joke) How would you translate these? If you use more conventional words, there is no joke! I am really curious about what you are going to do. Let us know what you decide.\n\nS.\n\nsperdomo said:\n\nHi Q.\n\nThis is not going to be easy to translate!

I am really curious about what you are going to do. Let us know what you decide.\n\nS.\n\ndoggone or dog gone or dog gone it. I think doggnone must be a typo. I never heard of it. I think that doggone, dagnabbed (or dagnab it) dad blasted are less like damn/damned and are really humorous euphemisms for damn--like durn or durn it.\n\nCotton pickin is a humorous insult which is also a euphemish for damn or damned or something worse. I guess it refers to people who pick cotton. A lowly job and hence an insult. Just something else to be thrown into a long curse, e. g., \"You cotton pickin son of a bitch, stay away from here\".\n\nQueva said:\n\nhe says:\n\n\"S'why ain't there no dagnabbed, doggone, dad blasted, two-bit, side windin', confounded, cotton-pickin', talk like a prospector day?\"\n\nAnswer: \"I think you have been hornswoggled, compadre\"\n\nAnswers back: \"Durn tootin' \"\n\nIn plain English:\n\nSo why isn't there a day to honor people who talk like gold prospectors (people who search for gold in the Old West.)\n\nFriend, I think you have been deceived.\n\nYou are absolutely right.\n\nNote that the words\n\ndagnabbed, doggone, dad blasted, two-bit, side windin', confounded, cotton-pickin' are words that the old prospectors would have used and he uses them to modify the ''day'' he wishes to honor such people.\n\nErhm..well, I did make it up from the term pig-Latin I thought it would give the idea - as I frankly have no idea what you would call that kind of english. Parody country slang maybe?\n\nAs for an equivalent in italian, it's very difficult to give any examples. We do not have any standard curse for the word \"damned\" that would compare to \"dadblasted\" or similar, and to portray a coarse countryside accent one would have to pick the region first, and then represent the accent and the typical manner of speaking with the usual: changing of letters in normal words and use of stereotypical expressions. For a Sicilian, one would write \"famigghia\" instead of \"famiglia\" (family); \"pecche'\" instead of \"perche'\" (why) and would use a lot of \"minchia\" which roughly translates everything from \"damn\" to \"For God's' sake\" For a stereotype northern mountain dweller, one would put an article in front of every name of person (la Sara, il Giovanni (lit. the Sara, the Giovanni) instead of plain Sara and Giovanni); then you would need to put most \"o\" sound into \"u\" sound, pronouncing the u as a German would - \"alura\" instead of \"allora\" (\"well?\" also \"therefore\") and you'd use a lot of stock phrases like \"eh\" \"ostia\" \"neh\" and similar.\n\nIt's a bit more complicated than that but that's the idea.\n\nTe gato..Looney Toones, that's an idea! I go rummage through my nephew's tapes\n\nThanks all\n\nQ.\n\nMy dad taught me what I call \"poo poo\" language. His parents spoke it in Portuguese to speak privately in front of their chaperon. It involves taking each syllable and repeating it, except you substitute the \"p\" with the same vowel sound the second time you say the syllable. Ending consonants are said with an\n\n-oo after them, followed by a \"poo--.\" Strangely enough, while in Argentina someone tried to code Spanish using the \"poo poo\" language, and I could understand them!\n\nAn example:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n--becomes\n\n\"Wha-puh-too-poo do-poo you-poo wa-pahn-too-poo?\n\nI'm guessing if there's not a pig-Latin forum, there won't be a poo-poo language forum any time soon....\n\nmjscott said:\n\nMy dad taught me what I call \"poo poo\" language.

Is it what you are talking about?\n\nIs it called \"poo poo\" language in English? Wow!\n\nPeople, I am glad that by reading this thread I learnt how to say \"jerigonzo\" in English. At the beginning I didn't understand what you were talking about.\n\nThat \"pig-English\" thing ... Now I read it again, and did some googling and found this.\n\nArtrella-\n\nWHEN will you ever run out of resources?!? If ever you need to reference that language in English--NO ONE WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY POO-POO LANGUAGE! I spoke it one time in a social setting, and some friends of mine just howled (in laughter). They quickly found a way to incorporate into a skit, and my friend called it Poo-poo language--because, I am supposing that the \"oo\" sound making a poo was so prevalent when speaking, and so funny. Poo-poo is a cutesy-child word for excrement. Outside of my father telling me about the language and hearing it only one time in Argentina--I have never met anyone who not only knew about it, but could give me its offical Spanish name and reference a website to it!\n\namazing...."
