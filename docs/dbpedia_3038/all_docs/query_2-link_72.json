        "text": "War Pigs was written and recorded by Black Sabbath and released in 1970. It was originally titled ‘Walpurgis’, an anniversary associated with witches and Satanists, but was changed on the recommendation of Black Sabbath’s record company. The lyrics of War Pigs take aim at military commanders, comparing them to sorcerers and “witches at black masses”. It also accuses politicians of starting wars but abdicating any responsibility for them. According to Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne War Pigs is a generic anti-war song; it was not specifically about Vietnam. War Pigs did not sell well as a single but has become an iconic song. Several critics consider it the best heavy metal anti-war song ever recorded.\n\nGenerals gathered in their masses,\n\nJust like witches at black masses\n\nEvil minds that plot destruction,\n\nSorcerer of death’s construction\n\nIn the fields the bodies burning,\n\nAs the war machine keeps turning\n\nDeath and hatred to mankind,\n\nPoisoning their brainwashed minds\n\nOh Lord Yeah!\n\nPoliticians hide themselves away\n\nThey only started the war\n\nWhy should they go out to fight?\n\nThey leave their role to the poor, yeah\n\nTime will tell on their empower minds,\n\nMaking war just for fun\n\nTreating people just like pawns in chess,\n\nWait ’til their judgement day comes, yeah\n\nNow in darkness world stops turning,\n\nAshes were the bodies burning\n\nNo more War Pigs have the power,\n\nHand of God has struck the hour\n\nDay of judgement, God is calling\n\nOn their knees the War Pigs crawling,\n\nBegging mercies for their sins\n\nSatan, laughing, spreads his wings\n\nOh Lord Yeah!"
