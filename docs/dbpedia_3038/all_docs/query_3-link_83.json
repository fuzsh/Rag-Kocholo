        "meta_description": "It's just a normal day in the life of Peter Porker, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Ham! Keeping New Yolk City safe from dastardly villains is no easy feat, especially when the Green Gobbler from the year 2099 travels back in time to team up with his present-day counterpart. Talk about a pair of rotten eggs! What's worse, Spider-Ham gets flung into the future, making it impossible to stop the duo's evil plot. He'll have to team up with heroes from all across time if he wants to make it back and save the day. But what is New Yolk City to do without its greatest defender? Luckily for everyone, Mary Jane Waterbuffalo and Black Catfish are here to pick up the slack while Peter Porker is messing around in the time stream. Can the two hold out long enough for Spider-Ham to return, or will the Green Gobbler finally claim his spot at the top of the roost?",
