        "text": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the most advanced stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with prevalence in the United States reaching 809,000 in 2019 (Johansen et al., 2022). The most used form of renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients in the United States is hemodialysis (HD). Despite significant improvements in HD technology, the mortality rate in ESRD patients is still as high as 20% annually (Williams et al., 2004), with infections being the most common cause of hospitalization and mortality after cardiovascular disease (Kato et al., 2008). The immunocompromised state of ESRD is characterized by simultaneous immunodepression due to the impact of uremic milieu on immunocompetent cells and immunoactivation due to the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (Kato et al., 2008). There are alterations to both innate and adaptive immunity, including elevated levels of mannose-binding lectin (Satomura et al., 2002), impaired maturation of monocytes and dendritic cells (Satomura et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2007), increased B cell apoptosis (Fernández-Fresnedo et al., 2000), and decreased T-cell proliferation with elevated Th1/Th2 ratio (Stenvinkel et al., 2005).\n\nStudies of genome-wide expression (i.e., transcriptome) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ESRD demonstrate a complex picture of immune alterations. One study found upregulation of genes involved in the complement and oxidative metabolism pathways, and downregulation of genes associated with the clathrin-coated vesicle endosomal pathway and T-cell receptor signaling (Scherer et al., 2013). Two other studies have demonstrated impaired expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Granata et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2002). A study identifying a group of inflammatory genes playing a causative role in oxidative stress in dialysis patients showed unique gene expression alterations in maintenance HD patients compared to un-dialyzed CKD patients and compared to patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (Zaza et al., 2008). These studies indicate a range of immune pathways that may impair vaccination response, and further suggest that dialysis leads to unique immune profile alterations. These alterations may lead to higher susceptibility to infection and lower response to vaccination (Ghadiani et al., 2012). For example, while more than 90% of patients without CKD develop protective antibodies against HBV after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert. There have also been higher vaccination failure rates demonstrated against influenza virus, Clostridium tetani, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae in ESRD (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007).\n\nUnderstanding the immune response to vaccines in ESRD is particularly important for the new mRNA vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have proven to be efficacious in non-immunocompromised individuals, with initial reports showing 95 and 94.1% reduction of COVID-19 disease in recipients (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). However, certain immunosuppressed populations remain at risk of infection. Given the widespread transmission of COVID-19, detailed assessments of degree, duration, and determinants of immune protection conferred by these vaccines are vitally needed in immunocompromised patient populations including those with ESRD.\n\nWhile recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 BTN162b2 vaccine in HD demonstrate high levels of seroconversion ranging from 84 to 96% (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021), they also demonstrate quantitatively reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We posit that characterization of the transcriptomic underpinnings of antibody titer development on a continuous scale may identify biomarkers for weaker or less durable immune protection in this population. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses may identify strategies for the development of new, effective vaccines against other infectious diseases for this population. Thus, we characterized the immune response of the HD population to the COVID-19 mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine using mRNA sequencing, anti-spike antibody ELISA, and neutralization titers across multiple time points. We then integrated these data to identify transcriptomic and clinical determinants of the humoral immune response in HD patients.\n\nOur results demonstrate differing expression of BTMs and differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects compared to controls. Controls demonstrated expected transitions from early type I interferon and myeloid activity to T cell activity after the first vaccination dose (Figure 1). The predominant positive enrichment of T cell modules in controls at 1 wk after the first vaccination dose (V1D7) was contrasted with predominant positive enrichment of myeloid modules in HD at V1D7. Interestingly, HD showed prolonged upregulation of myeloid activity at V1D7, while controls showed downregulation of these modules at V1D7 (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Overall, these observations indicate delayed resolution of innate myeloid responses in the HD cohort and suggest diminished transition to an adaptive immune response.\n\nFollowing the second vaccination dose, both groups demonstrated early enrichment of innate immune modules, with HC alone transitioning to a plasma cell response by V2D7 (Figure 1C). Direct group comparisons at V2D7 did not show differences of plasma cell response, but metabolic activity was decreased in HD compared to controls (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Further, HD demonstrated increased V2D7 expression compared to controls of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BH3, a mediator of lymphocyte apoptosis. A prior study showed accelerated in vitro apoptosis of lymphocytes in uremia, with a particularly pronounced effect on B cells, mediated by dysregulation of Bcl-2. These results suggest a state of heightened cellular stress in HD after vaccination leading to increased apoptotic signaling.\n\nDespite differing transcriptomic time courses in the two group, our results demonstrate significant elevation of anti-spike IgG titers after two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in both HD and controls. HD demonstrated only a slight decrease of IgG levels at V2D7 when controlling for SARS-CoV-2 history (p<0.05) and no statistically significant difference at 6 mo. Prior studies comparing short-term antibody response to BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in HD versus controls find antibody response rates of 84–96% in HD after two vaccination doses, but with lower mean IgG levels compared to controls (Grupper et al., 2021; Jahn et al., 2021; Attias et al., 2021; Anand et al., 2021; Agur et al., 2021; Longlune et al., 2021; Drakesmith et al., 2021). Notably, the HD population studied here is younger and more racially and ethnically diverse. The average age of HD cohorts in prior studies was predominantly in the 60s, compared to an average age of 54 in our study. Jahn et al. found in a subset analysis that HD patients under 60 y of age responded equally to healthy controls, suggesting an interaction between increasing age and less effective antibody response in HD patients (Jahn et al., 2021).\n\nHD subjects with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to vaccination had wider variance of antibody titers at all time points in this study, with two subjects demonstrating V1D0 antibody titer levels similar to that of uninfected subjects. These two subjects consistently had the lowest titer levels at V2D7 and M6 within the group of previously infected subjects and amongst the lowest titers across all subjects. One subject is the oldest enrolled patient, and both are diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.\n\nGiven previously and presently demonstrated the wider variance of protective immune responses in HD and altered interactions with risk factors including age, it is valuable to identify predictors of the strength of immune response to vaccination in this population. We identified both transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG development at both V2D7 and 6 mo after the second vaccination dose (M6). Increased gene expression of blood transcription modules (BTMs) including monocyte activity, dendritic cell and antigen presentation activity, IFN type I activity, and T cell activation 2 d after the second vaccination dose (V2D2) in HD were predictive of V2D7 anti-spike IgG. Additionally, increased expression of PLK1 signaling events, indicating increased cell cycle activity, at V2D7 was predictive of V2D7 and M6 anti-spike IgG. Clinically, serum ferritin values in the intermediate range at baseline predicted stronger anti-spike IgG development. A prior study of 58,058 maintenance HD subjects found serum ferritin levels between 200 and 1200 ng/ml to be associated with lower all-cause mortality due to ferritin <200 ng/ml representing low iron status, and >1200 ng/ml representing a hyper-inflammatory state due to ferritin’s status as an acute phase reactant (Kalantar-Zadeh et al., 2005). Iron deficiency has been linked to impaired immune response and vaccine efficacy in other infections, while inflammation induces macrophage release of the heavy chain component of ferritin, FTH, which has been reported to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and function (Drakesmith et al., 2021; Kernan and Carcillo, 2017). Additionally, increased LFC in WBC count 1–3 wk after vaccination was predictive of higher antibody titers.\n\nOur study is limited by different early time points between controls and HD (day 1 vs. day 2 after each vaccination dose), sample size particularly when subdividing SARS-CoV-2 history, and differing racial profiles of the control and HD cohort. The smaller sample size additionally limits our ability to characterize differential immune pathways in clinical subsets of the dialysis population, such as those with low, medium, and high baseline ferritin levels. Our small sample size precludes a validation cohort to validate the study’s results. We also cannot exclude the likelihood that these results are driven in part by immune dysregulation from diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. While we did not exclude these in recruitment of our control cohort, subjects in the HD cohort are inevitably disproportionately affected by these conditions. Future studies are needed for more comprehensive characterization of the immune pathway recruitment in response to the COVID-19 vaccinations in this population. It will be of further interest to characterize immune responses dependent on etiology of ESRD (i.e., hypertension vs. diabetes mellitus), as well as amount of time spent on hemodialysis, as this study was not sufficiently powered to disentangle these differences.\n\nThe COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proven more efficacious than other vaccines in the ESRD population, both for COVID-19 and for other infectious diseases; for example, there has been an inconsistent antibody response in HD to the adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S compared to mRNA vaccines (Brunelli et al., 2022). Additionally, while more than 90% of patients without chronic kidney disease develop protective antibodies against hepatitis B after vaccination, only 50–60% of patients with ESRD seroconvert (Eleftheriadis et al., 2007). One explanation is that, in mRNA vaccines, the mRNA both encodes the viral antigen and acts as an adjuvant due to its innate immunostimulatory properties; the mRNA is recognized by endosomal and cytosolic innate sensors upon cell entry, resulting in cellular activation and production of type I interferons and other inflammatory mediators (Teijaro and Farber, 2021). This elevated innate immune stimulus could overcome immune desensitization in ESRD, evidenced by diminished TLR4 expression on monocytes (Koc et al., 2011) and downregulation of activating receptors on natural killer cells in this population (Nagai, 2021). If so, the mRNA vaccine delivery vehicle could prove particularly valuable in vaccine development for ESRD and HD going forward.\n\nOverall, we demonstrate differing time courses of immune responses to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in maintenance HD subjects and identify transcriptomic and clinical predictors of anti-spike IgG titers in HD. Given the efficacy of this vaccination in our HD cohort, the differential transcriptomic responses likely represent immune alterations with subclinical effects on humoral immune response to the BTN162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Our results warrant further characterization of the immune dysregulation of ESRD and of immune biomarkers that underlie efficacious immune responses to vaccination in this population."
