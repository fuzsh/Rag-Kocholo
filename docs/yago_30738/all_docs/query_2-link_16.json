        "text": "\"She belongs in motion pictures, but instead works as a burlesque dancer at the city’s most ”upscale” nightclub – where she inevitably attracts the attention of many powerful men, manipulating their weaknesses and desires for her own ends.\"\n\n— Biography\n\nJessica Rose is a character appearing in Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies, as one of the four main characters of Shadows of Evil. She is voiced and motion-captured by Heather Graham.\n\nBiography[]\n\nJessica works as a burlesque dancer in the Black Lace club, though she dreams of becoming a famous Hollywood star. In order to make it happen, she went as far as engaging in a sexual relationship with a film producer. The relationship, however, was caught by a press photographer, who threatened to blackmail Jessica. Left with no choice, she decided to invite him over, luring him into a trap and killing him to get rid of the evidence.\n\nOn one night, Jessica does her usual performance at Black Lace, where she meets the magician Nero Blackstone, the boxer Floyd Campbell, and Detective Jack Vincent. During her performance, the four of them are mysteriously knocked out cold. Each of them later wake up in different areas of Morg, finding their left hand branded with the Mark of the Beast. They discover zombies roaming around the city, and attempt to escape, only to reunite in an alley later.\n\nA mysterious figure calling himself Shadowman then asks the four characters to complete the rituals to atone for their sins. Jessica collects her ritual item, which is the film producer's toupée, and later sacrifices him as part of the ritual. After finishing all the rituals, the Shadowman reveals that they have opened a gateway to freeing the Apothicon on their dimension. After reading a book located in Nero's lair, the four find out the true nature of the Apothicon, as well as the Keepers. They then proceed to summon the Keepers under the Rift, where they work together to \"kill\" the Shadowman.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to them, only his physical body was destroyed and his soul is preserved within the Summoning Key. Using the power of the Keepers, they destroy the large Apothicon creature roaming the skies of Morg City, freeing their dimension from the Apothicon's wrath. As the Keepers return the key to them, Primis Edward Richtofen quickly appears and takes it. He thanks Jessica and the others for their efforts, then teleports away, leaving the crew behind. The next day, the Apothicons destroyed their dimension, killing them.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nMain article: Shadows of Evil/Quotes#Jessica Rose\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
