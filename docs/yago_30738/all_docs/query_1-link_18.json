        "text": "IU alumnus Scott Dolson is in his fifth year as IU’s Vice President and Director of Intercollegiate Athletics. The native of Michigan City, Ind., began his role at the helm of IU Athletics July 1, 2020, after spending the previous 11 years as the department’s Deputy Director of Athletics and chief operating officer.\n\nDolson has since overseen an era of remarkable athletic and academic accomplishments for the department. These achievements have come against a backdrop that includes the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid pandemic and the rapidly-evolving world of intercollegiate athletics.\n\nAcademically, IU’s student-athletes performed at an extraordinary level in 2023-24. Thirteen of IU’s programs earned a perfect Academic Progress Report (APR) score in the spring of 2024, and IU’s collective APR score of 991 (out of 1,000) was the second-best in school history. IU also earned a 90 percent Graduation Success Rate (GSR) score last year, the fifth time in the last six years IU has been at 90 percent or better. And during the 2023-24 academic year, 141 IU student-athletes also earned their degrees.\n\nAthletically, IU teams excelled individually and collectively on the Big Ten and NCAA levels in 2023-24. Four IU programs captured Big Ten Championships in 2023-24, the most by IU in 32 years and the second-most of any Big Ten school. IU Men’s Soccer captured both the Big Ten regular and postseason championships for a Big Ten record 12th time, and advanced to the NCAA Elite Eight for an NCAA record 29th time. IU Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving each won Big Ten titles, although in very different ways. The men won their third straight title in dominating fashion, besting the runner-up by nearly 300 points. The women, meanwhile, secured their first league title in five years by a mere ½ point, slipping past second-place Ohio State in the final relay event of the championships. The programs continued their successes at NCAAs, where they finished fourth and seventh, respectively. The final Big Ten championship came in women’s golf, where IU rallied on the final day to claim the title by one stroke. The championship was IU Women’s Golf’s first in 26 years. On top of those championship performances, many other IU programs performed at an extremely high level. Women’s Basketball was the Big Ten runner-up, advanced to the Sweet 16 for the third time in four years, and became just the fifth Big Ten program to average 10,000 fans at its home games in a single season. Indiana Softball and Baseball each earned NCAA Tournament invitations, making IU the only Big Ten school to have both of those programs included in the postseason tourney.\n\nIn addition to the team accomplishments, IU student-athletes also enjoyed great individual successes. Swimmer Brendan Burns (100 back) and Carson Tyler (3-meter, platform) each captured individual NCAA championships, marking the 16th straight non-COVID year that IU has had at least one individual NCAA champion. IU also had three student-athletes earn Big Ten Athlete of the Year honors: Burns (Men’s Swimming), Tyler (Men’s Diving), and Jamie Gerstenberg (Women’s Soccer – Goalkeeper of the Year). IU had 31 student-athletes earn first, second, or third-team All-America honors, and 36 earn first-team All-Big Ten honors.\n\nIU Athletics is also enjoying record-setting performances in terms of attendance. In basketball, the men ranked first in the Big Ten and sixth nationally in home attendance, while the women ranked No. 2 in the conference and fifth in the country. Combined, IU welcomed more basketball fans to its home games (472,132) than any school in the country. Especially noteworthy on the women’s side was IU averaged 10,336 to its home games, marking only the fifth time in Big Ten history that a women’s basketball team has averaged 10,000-plus during a season. In addition to those successes at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, IU Volleyball enjoyed a pair of sellouts in 2023, and IU Football ranked No. 52 nationally with nearly 45,000 per home game.\n\nUnder Dolson’s leadership, IU continues to be at the forefront of supporting its female student-athletes and women’s intercollegiate athletics. Shortly after he assumed the leadership of IU Athletics, he announced the creation of the Women’s Excellence Initiative, a fundraising effort designed to enhance the intercollegiate athletic opportunities for IU’s female student-athletes. To help direct these efforts, the IU Athletics Women’s Excellence Committee was created under the Varsity Club National Board of Directors, a group that includes, among others, former Indiana University First Lady Laurie Burns McRobbie, IU Board of Trustees member Donna Spears, Indianapolis Colts’ Vice Chair and Owner Kalen Jackson, and co-founder and Board Chair of the Samerian Foundation Cindy Simon Skjodt. Since its launch in August of 2021, Women’s Excellence has raised more than $8.5 million – far exceeding the initial goal of $1 million. Those funds have already been used for facility enhancements that have impacted Women’s Basketball, Field Hockey, Rowing, and Softball, and to fund overseas off-season training trips for Volleyball and Women’s Basketball. The impact of Women’s Excellence is also obvious when looking at the women’s programs’ competitive success. In 2023-24 IU women multiple Big Ten team championships in women’s sports for the first time in 24 years.\n\nUnder Dolson’s leadership, IU Athletics is also a leader in diversity both on the IU campus and in the Big Ten Conference. IU heads into the 2024-25 academic year with the second-most diverse group of head coaches among all 18 Big Ten institutions, as 26.3% of its head coaches are people of color. During his first four years at the helm of IU Athletics, Dolson has hired five head coaches, three of whom are people of color (Men’s Basketball Coach Mike Woodson, Women’s Tennis Coach Gabby Moore, and Track and Field Coach Ed Beathea). And of the nearly 800 student-athletes who represented Indiana University in intercollegiate athletics during the 2023-24 season, 30.1% were people of color. The numbers are similar for IU’s group of assistant coaches for its 24 varsity programs, of which 26% are people of color.\n\nThroughout Dolson’s tenure, IU Athletics has also been a national leader in the Name, Image and Likeness arena. IU has established partnerships with industry leaders Opendorse and Altius Sports Partners, as well as the IU Kelley School of Business, Media School and Maurer School of Law, to support the department’s ongoing and comprehensive efforts to educate and support its student-athletes and allow them to maximize their opportunity in the new intercollegiate athletics landscape. IU Athletics was also among the first department’s to formally create and announce a department-wide Name, Image and Likeness Policy to guide its NIL efforts. Thanks in large part to that vision and Dolson’s efforts, there are three highly-active IU affiliated NIL entities that are actively forming partnerships with IU student-athletes – Hoosiers For Good, Hoosiers Connect, and the Hoosier Hysterics Collective.\n\nThe last four years have also featured extensive efforts and initiatives to support the well-being of all members of the Indiana University Athletics family. In the fall of 2020, IU Athletics created the IU Athletics Mental Health Task Force as well as the Anti-Hate and Anti-Racism Coalition. Under the Mental Health Task Force’s leadership, IU has introduced extensive and ongoing programming through the Excellence Academy to increase awareness, maintain a healthy culture, provide resources, and develop key programming to support student-athletes, coaches and staff. The Anti-Hate and Anti-Racism Coalition, meanwhile, has been active in developing opportunities for student-athletes and staff to engage in diversity and inclusivity programming.\n\nIn addition to his successes at IU, Dolson has also been involved in a leadership role on the Big Ten and NCAA levels. He recently completed the first of his two-year stint as the Chairperson of the Big Ten Athletic Directors Group, and he also was named to the NCAA Division I Baseball Selection Committee in January of 2024.\n\nDolson was appointed to his role as the leader of IU Athletics by former IU President Michael A. McRobbie. In assuming the role, Dolson has remained committed to and anchored by the five priorities put in place by his predecessor, Fred Glass.\n\n1. Playing by the rules;\n\n2. Being well in mind, body and spirit;\n\n3. Achieving academically;\n\n4. Excelling athletically; and\n\n5. Integrating with the University.\n\nIn his previous role as Deputy Director of Athletics under Glass, Dolson\n\nhelped oversee strategic planning of all facility projects and renovations, ensuring the successful completion of the university's Bicentennial Facilities Master Plan for IU Athletics, which includes over $150 million in facility construction and renovations. In recent years, these projects have included the North End Zone Student-Athlete Development Center, the Henke Hall of Champions, the D. Ames Shuel Academic Center, Bart Kaufman Field, the Andy Mohr Softball Field, the Cook Hall basketball practice facility, the renovated Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall, the enclosure of the South End Zone of Memorial Stadium (Excellence Academy), and Wilkinson Hall, IU's new home for its volleyball and wrestling teams. More recently, the projects also include the four-year-old championship golf course, The Pfau Course at Indiana University, and the Tardy Center renovations at Armstrong Stadium.\n\nIn addition to his role as deputy director of intercollegiate athletics, Dolson maintained his leadership as the fourth director of the Varsity Club. As director, he managed the athletic department's overall fundraising program for scholarships, annual giving, endowments and athletic facilities.\n\nThe Michigan City, Indiana, native graduated from IU with a bachelor's degree in management from the Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. While doing his undergraduate work, Dolson was a student manager for the IU men's basketball team for four seasons, serving as the program's head manager in 1988. Following graduation in 1988, he worked for Tim Knight Enterprises before joining the joining the Varsity Club staff in December 1989.\n\nDolson and his wife, Heidi, have five children: Luke, Sam and Zach Wisen, and Kristen and Nick Dolson.\n\n2023-24 IU Athletics Accomplishments\n\nThirteen programs earned a perfect Academic Progress Rate (APR) score of 1,000, and collectively IU programs had a 991 APR score, the second-best in school history\n\nEarned a Graduation Success Rate score of 90%, the department’s fifth 90%-or higher score in the last six years\n\n141 student-athletes earned their Indiana University degrees\n\nWon the Governor’s Cup against Purdue 13-7, IU’s sixth consecutive win in the series\n\nMackenzie Holmes and Nathan Stone named G.
