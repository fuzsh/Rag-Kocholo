A true friend and mother to everyone who passed through her door, Dee will always be remembered as a woman who opened her heart and her home to all who knew her. Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dee was raised in Philadelphia by her parents, Howard T. and Florence R. Mitchell. While attending the University of Pennsylvania and earning her bachelor's degree in education, she met Charles S. Gould, a young, dashing merchant mariner on a blind date arranged by her Alpha Chi Omega sorority sister. On Aug. 17, 1946, the two married and began their life together in New Brunswick, N.J. Dee taught kindergarten and Charlie worked towards his master's degree at Rutgers University. In 1954, Charlie, a sales representative at Dupont Chemical, was transferred to Maine and they settled there after a brief stint in Texas. In 1956, they moved to their home in South Freeport and raised their four children. Dee was a member of The South Freeport Congregational Church where she was a long time choir member (she had a voice like an angel), organist and junior choir director. A member of the Harraseeket Yacht Club, Dee was also politically active in town and county politics and was an accomplished piano player who even taught lessons for a few years. In 1966, Dee went back to work first at Job Corps in Poland Springs, then later, in 1970, as a psychiatric social worker at the Bridgeton Mental Health Clinic. Later in 1978, she transferred to Maine Medical Center where, in addition to her duties in the psychiatric unit, she did consultations in the ER and burn units. Dee's experiences made her a firm advocate of family participation. She once said, 'I'm a great believer in family involvement. People don't live in a vacuum, they live in a system with others. Mental illness represents great challenges, but with understanding comes acceptance.' No one knew more about family acceptance than Dee herself. After her retirement in 1990, she turned her attention and efforts to her family and friends, keeping up a long-standing Gould family tradition called 'Augustfest,' a family reunion held in their home for the past 30 years or so. Augustfest was an event which Dee planned and executed in her typical way-with tons of love and even more important perhaps, her 'meticulous' lists of everything from guests to menus to sleeping arrangements. No matter whether 10 people attended or 100, Dee was ready for anything. Dee is survived by her husband of 62 years, Charles S. Gould; her children, Charles M. Gould of Portland, Barbara L. Gould of Lincolnville, Matthew R. Gould of Falmouth, Mass., and James D. Gould of Natick, Mass.; and her four grandchildren, Louisa, Morgan, Steven and Danny; as well as many, many beloved cousins, nieces, nephews and close friends whom she considered her own.
