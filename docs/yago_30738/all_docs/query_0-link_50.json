Under the guidance of advisors, the Labs allow fellows to deepen the creative potential of their projects, develop their creative instincts and evolve their storytelling, communication and problem-solving skills at all stages of their project. The fellows continue on through the Producers Summit and receive ongoing year-long mentorship, creative support, and networking opportunities with industry.\n\nThis year’s advisors include fiction producers Mollye Asher (Academy Award winner, Nomadland), Amy Lo (Nancy), Paul Mezey (After Yang), Laura Rister (The Tale), and nonfiction producers Violeta Bava (Azor) Jannat Gargi (Vice Studios), Andrea Meditch (Fathom), and Tracy Rector (Nia Tero). The Producers Summit brings together diverse sectors of the industry including financiers, packaging agents, distributors, and domestic and international sales representatives with emerging and mid-career producers for a revolving series of conversations around critical issues facing the field and producer sustainability. The program includes curated talks, one-on-one meetings, roundtables and a keynote conversation with Hasan Minhaj exploring the critical role of bold, personal storytelling.\n\nThe Fellows and projects selected for the 2021 Feature Film Producers Lab are:\n\nCaity (U.S.)\n\nProducing Fellow: Katie White\n\nWhile managing her family’s local haunted house with her alcoholic father, Paul, 16-year-old Caity navigates the evaporating space between childhood and adulthood and discovers a fantasy of intimacy in another teenage employee, Hannah.\n\nKatie White is a creative producer.
