Kerrigan is the latest in a long line of historically funny women who cut their teeth at the World Famous Comedy Store. Starting out as a waitress there, Eleanor learned the ropes of comedy, all the while making the best comics in the country laugh, in the kitchen of the club. It would take several years and lots of pushing from one of her biggest fans, Andrew Dice Clay, to finally get her to take her comedic talents to the stage. After co-starring with him in “Dice Undisputed”, Dice invited Eleanor to go on the road with him to promote the show. “I’m an actress not a stand up!” she replied. After seeing her one woman show, Andrew would no longer take no for an answer. “You’re hysterical and everyone should know that!” he said, and Eleanor’s been performing stand up in clubs and theaters around the country ever since. Her hilarious take on life comes from her unique experiences growing up street-savvy in South Philly, as one of 10 children in a very Irish-Catholic family. She paints an uproarious portrait of her life experiences, beginning with her childhood in a three bedroom row home and moving to her adventures as an adult living in L.A... Eleanor’s shoot-from-the-hip take on life is both refreshing and exciting. She’s not afraid to give the audience a piece of her mind and they love her for it. She’s had audiences rolling as one of the motorcycle riding, pool cue wielding tag team called “Harley’s Angels” on UPN’s “Women of Wrestling” and has made countless appearances on other major networks such as Nickelodeon, VH1, Howard Stern & HBO’s Entourage, The Blue Show on Showtime. You can also catch her on The Ringers on Comedy Central with Bill Burr & The Comedy Store Documentary on Showtime.

When he released his debut album, Dice, the parental advisory label simply read “Warning: This album is offensive.” Despite media backlash, Dice’s rise to fame was nothing less than meteoric, creating “Dicemania.” He’s sold-out hundreds of arenas across the country, famously sold-out Madison Square Garden (MSG) two nights in a row in 1990 and was the only performer ever “Banned for Life from MTV” (a ban which has since been lifted).\n\nDice has released numerous gold and platinum-selling albums including the Rick Rubin-produced The Day The Laughter Died (among the five releases Rubin produced for Dice); best-selling DVDs (Dice Rules!); and starred in several one-hour HBO, pay per view, and Showtime stand-up specials including No Apologies, The Diceman Cometh, and Indestructible.\n\nIn recent years, Dice’s career has experienced a resurgence including his recurring role on the final season of Entourage (2011). He starred to great critical acclaim alongside Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine (2013); in Martin Scorsese’s Vinyl (2016); in the award winning, blockbuster hit, A Star Is Born(2018) alongside Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga; and in Hulu’s Pam & Tommy (2022).
