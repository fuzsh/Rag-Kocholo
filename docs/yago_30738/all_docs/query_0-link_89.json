        "text": "Reviews\n\nALITA: BATTLE ANGEL. Well, shit. As I sit quietly with the fortunately fading memory of this movie, I am faced with dilemma: Did I even try to want to like it? Did I sacrifice that crucial tenet to preconceived notions, early onset joylessness and dismay at copycat world-building? As one might already have gleaned, I did not like Alita: Battle Angel (even the title seems clumsy and vaguely offensive from where I sit). But did I even give it a chance? Should I have bothered? Well, yes and no, as so often is the case.\n\nJust because a movie is adapted from a given media (manga, let's say) said movie does not necessarily have to adhere to the aesthetic tenets of the source. Nobody seems to have gotten that memo, however, and so manga adaptations generally attempt to play like a comic reads on the page. Cinema — like comics, literature, music, painting and sculpture — is its own medium and need not ape the original art's medium — that art already exists. The movie version should transcend and transmute the source material into something that could not exist on the page. (It's a masking-tape-on-the-glasses distinction, I know.)\n\nPerhaps I should have found hope in the hands of the adaptors of Alita. In my youth, I was a fairly devout Robert Rodriguez acolyte — more Desperado (1995) than El Mariachi (1992), as I'm a sucker for production value — reading and re-reading his book Rebel Without a Crew, espousing his frugal, anti-establishment doctrine, playing his soundtracks on loop and biting them for my own little (highly derivative) movie projects. And when he adapted Frank Miller with Sin City (2005), I thought he pulled off the trick of a reverential adaptation that brought new life to the material with some aplomb. (How well that adaptation, let alone its flat-footed sequel, will continue to age remains to be seen.) But it the last of his projects I liked; even Machete (2010) drew off most of the fun from a brilliant concept. And I didn't even realize James Cameron was involved until after the fact, which is probably for the best: That megalomaniac has been on my list for over 20 years now.\n\nSo yes, I had semi-subconsciously stacked the deck against Alita and the trailer was no help. But as I sit with my feelings about it, I think I gave it a fair chance. Maybe I'm looking for forgiveness from myself but that would be a first.\n\nFrom the first frame, the formidable cast (Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Christoph Waltz, Jeff Fahey, an unrecognizable Jackie Earle Haley and Rosa Salazar in the lead) could do nothing to win me back, nor did the immersive depth of field of the effects, because it was in service of a pallid, hackneyed vision of a dystopian future that started off copping elements from landmarks of science fiction (and from less significant works of cinema at large) and never seemed to let up.\n\nAlita is a robot, or parts thereof, found on a scrap-heap in a squalid future city by a gifted cyborg surgeon (Waltz). He brings her back to life, partially in an effort to reanimate some semblance of his dead daughter. Turns out he's also a bounty hunter with an ambitious ex-wife with questionable motives (Connelly). She works for the chairman of the mega-sport Motorball (Ali), at which Alita is preternaturally adept because, natch, she was some sort of super soldier in her previous life. It just goes on and on and on, with a teen love story thrown in, leading to a non-climax in attempts to reach a city in the sky, followed by a blatant sequel set-up for a second installment we can only hope does not make it to production. PG13. 122M. BROADWAY, FORTUNA, MILL CREEK, MINOR.\n\nISN'T IT ROMANTIC. I harbor no particular disdain for romantic comedies: Their forebears, the screwball comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, boast some of the sharpest, funniest writing in American movie history. But they've become lazy, simple to dull, easy-money generators for incurious date-nighters happy to forget about a movie as soon as it ends. Isn't It Romantic may not buck that trend entirely but it manages to skewer some of the weaker elements of contemporary romantic comedy, while also celebrating some of the genre's classic, late-20th century moves.\n\nNatalie (Rebel Wilson), a talented architect with little self-respect and less patience for notions of romance, is a bit of a doormat in her own life. That is, until she smashes her head on an I-beam in the subway and wakes up in a world defined by rom-com tropes. The dashing billionaire (Liam Hemsworth) becomes immediately smitten with her; her weirdo shut-in neighbor is now her offensively flamboyant Gay Best Friend (Brandon Scott Jones); the ignored co-worker who loves her (Adam Devine) has a swimsuit model (Priyanka Chopra) desperate to marry him; there are flower shops and cupcakeries on every corner; and musical numbers pop off spontaneously. Clearly this is not a world built to last and so Natalie sets out to learn the Important Lesson that will send her home again.\n\nLight and ultimately inconsequential, Isn't It Romantic remains noteworthy for its semi-wicked sense of humor, its balanced attitude toward beauty myths and cultural \"norms\" and the obvious love its makers have for the love stories of their collective youth.
