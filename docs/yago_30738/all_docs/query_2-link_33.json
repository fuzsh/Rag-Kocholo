This enigmatic Australian New Wave masterpiece delves into the mysteries of a clutch of Victorian schoolgirls roving through the wilderness on a hot summer afternoon. Renowned for its BAFTA-winning cinematography, the tensely lyrical drama is “filled with palpable dread and rich iconography that is delivered with spellbinding artistry” (Matthew Pejkovic).\n\nTAKE SHELTER (Jeff Nichols, 2011, 35mm, 120 mins)\n\nSPANOLA PEPPER SAUCE COMPANY (Ray McKinnon, 2013, DCP, 8 mins)\n\n7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6, 2024\n\nTwo tales of the anxieties of fatherhood set in rural America. In Take Shelter, Michael Shannon gives a powerhouse performance as a man whose apocalyptic visions leave him unsure if he should protect his family from an impending calamity or from himself. Jessica Chastain, Shea Whigham, and Spanola’s director Ray McKinnon co-star.\n\nSUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 26, 2024\n\nF.W. Murnau (1927, 35mm, 94 mins)\n\nLive musical accompaniment by Donald Sosin and Joanna Seaton! New print! Murnau brought German Expressionism to Hollywood with his first American film, a story of a farmer tempted away from his loving wife by a big city vamp. Sunrise won Best Unique and Artistic Picture at the very first Academy Awards. “To see it today is to be astonished by the boldness of its visual experimentation” (Roger Ebert).\n\nCAPOTE\n\n7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024\n\nBennett Miller (2005, 35mm, 114 mins)\n\nCelebrate Truman Capote’s centenary with a portrait of the literary legend during his writing of In Cold Blood. Philip Seymour Hoffman won an Academy Award for his transformation into a troubled scribe who “knocks on your door with a smile, a pen, and a piece of ice in his heart” (Zadie Smith). Catherine Keener received one of the film’s five Oscar nominations as Capote’s childhood friend, Harper Lee.\n\nDOUBLE INDEMNITY, 80th Anniversary Screening\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 10, 2024\n\nBilly Wilder (1944, 35mm, 107 mins)\n\nNew print! A SoCal femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck) lures a gullible insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) into a murder plot in a hardboiled classic that earned seven Oscar nominations. Adapted by Wilder and first-time screenwriter Raymond Chandler from the James M. Cain novel, this “shrewd, smoothly tawdry thriller” (Pauline Kael) is “film noir at its finest” (Rob Fraser).\n\nPRESSURE\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024\n\nHorace Ové (1976, 35mm, 126 mins)\n\nNew print! The UK’s first Black feature-length drama stars Herbert Norville as a young Brit navigating life in Ladbroke Grove, not quite at home with either his Windrush-generation Trinidadian family or an unaccepting English establishment. Pressure “has the punchy quality of a 21st-century graphic novel, eagerly tackling Black Power and social realism, mixing comedy, tragedy, and irony” (Peter Bradshaw).\n\nBRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN\n\nLocation: 53 Wall Street Auditorium\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024\n\nJames Whale (1935, 35mm, 75 mins)\n\nNew print! She’s alive! Elsa Lanchester is one of cinema’s most shockingly unforgettable icons as the potential partner (produced from purloined parts) for Boris Karloff’s Monster. Whale’s masterpiece is both chilling and campy, mixing sci-fi, sacrilege, and social satire to create “the finest of all gothic horror movies” (Philip French). See this Universal classic with us this Halloween…if you dare!\n\nTHE CONVERSATION, 50th Anniversary Screening\n\n7 p.m. Friday, Nov. 1, 2024\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola (1974, 35mm, 113 mins)\n\nNew print! Gene Hackman gives one of his greatest performances as Harry Caul, a San Francisco surveillance expert who may have listened in on a murder. This “bleak and devastatingly brilliant film” (Time Out) boasts an ensemble that includes John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford, Teri Garr, and Robert Duvall.\n\nMADAME SATÃ\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024\n\nKarim Aïnouz (2002, 35mm, 105 mins)\n\nBased on the true story of a drag queen, folk hero, and small-time gangster who rose to cabaret stardom in 1930s Brazil, this gritty drama “doesn't glorify dos Santos but examines the hot, reckless fever of his life in all its thorny complexity” (Edward Guthmann). “It's a vivid, emotionally charged snapshot that makes no apologies or excuses” (Chris Vognar). In Portuguese with English subtitles.\n\nBLACK NARCISSUS\n\n7 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024\n\nMichael Powell & Emeric Pressburger (1947, 35mm, 101 mins)\n\nNew print! Anglican nuns attempt to create a convent school high in the Himalayas, but chilling winds and emerging obsessions threaten to throw their plans—and vows, and sanity—off a cliff. Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Sabu, and a spellbinding Kathleen Byron star in this “rapturous, near-indescribable work of cinematic art” (Noel Murray). Technicolor at its most emotionally expressive.\n\nBREATHLESS\n\n7 p.m. Friday, Dec. 13, 2024\n\nJean-Luc Godard (1960, 35mm, 90 mins)\n\nNew print! A defining film of the French New Wave, Godard’s debut is “a thoroughgoing assault on the accepted grammar of filmmaking” (Sam Wigley) and is marked by “a cavalier insouciance that feels like liberation” (A.O. Scott). Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg deliver career-defining performances as a thief and his American girlfriend, with a supporting cast that includes Rivette, Melville, and Godard himself. In French with English subtitles.\n\nPAST TREASURES SCREENINGS\n\nSLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE\n\n7 p.m. Wednesday, July 17, 2024\n\nDanny Boyle (UK, 2008, 120 mins), introduction by Brian Meacham\n\nMOULIN
