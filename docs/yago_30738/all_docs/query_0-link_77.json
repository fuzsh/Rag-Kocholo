        "text": "The 25th edition of the South by Southwest Conference and Festival have unveiled its robust lineup and opening-night film for the festival. The confab runs March 9-18 in Austin.\n\n“2018 marks the 25th edition of the SXSW Film Festival and my 10th year at the helm. As we look back on the body of work of talent discovered, careers launched and wonderful films we’ve enjoyed, we couldn’t be more excited about the future,” said Janet Pierson, SXSW’s Director of Film. “This year’s slate, while peppered with works from many of our alumni, remains focused on new voices, new directors and a range of films that entertain and enlighten.”\n\nOpening the fest is A Quiet Place, directed by and starring John Krasinski. The horror pic teams Krasinski and his wife Emily Blunt for the first time in a story following a family living in quiet solitude in the woods — the keyword being quiet. They use sign language, which we soon see is a choice, not a necessity. The movie’s tagline “If they can’t hear you, they can’t hunt you” and the teaser trailer pretty much gives you an idea of what to expect from a film like this.\n\n“We are particularly pleased to present John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place as our opening-night film,” Pierson added. “Not only do we love its originality, suspense and amazing cast, we love seeing artists stretch and explore. While this is not Krasinski’s first feature as writer and director, it’s an exciting evolution for this multi-talented artist.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFeature films in the SXSW lineup are categorized into 12 sections: Narrative Feature Competition, Documentary Feature Competition, Headliners, Narrative Spotlight, Documentary Spotlight, Visions, Midnighters, Episodic, 24 Beats Per Second, Global, Festival Favorites, and Special Events.\n\nDuring the nine days of SXSW, 132 features will be shown, with additional titles yet to be announced. The full lineup will include 44 films from first-time filmmakers, 86 World Premieres, 11 North American Premieres, and 5 U.S. Premieres. These films were selected from 2,458 feature-length film submissions, with a total of 8,160 films submitted this year.\n\nTitles included this year in the Narrative Competition are Family directed by Laura Steinel; First Match directed by Olivia Newman; Jinn directed by Nijla Mu’min and others. The Documentary Competition includes i-Town directed by Nick Budabin, Garry Winogrand: All Things are Photographable directed by Sasha Waters, and The Gospel of Eureka directed by Michael Palmieri and Donal Mosher.\n\nOther highlights for this year’s lineup include the documentary The Bill Murray Stories: Life Lessons Learned From a Mythical Man directed by Tommy Avallone, the Kay Cannon-directed Blockers, Paradox from Daryl Hannah, Timur Bekmambetov’s Profile as well as A Vigilante directed by Sarah Daggar Nickson.\n\nOn the episodic end of the spectrum, SXSW will feature Bill Hader’s Barry, and Jordan Peele’s The Last O.G. starring Tracy Morgan and Tiffany Haddish.\n\nThe SXSW Film Festival is also launching a new Independent Episodic section which is an expansion of its Episodic section that started in 2014. The lineup for Independent Episodic, Midnighters, Shorts, Virtual Cinema, Title Sequences, Music Videos and late-breaking Features will be announced February 7.\n\nFor now, read the first wave of the feature lineup below.\n\nNARRATIVE FEATURE COMPETITION\n\nTen world premieres; ten unique ways to celebrate the art of storytelling.
