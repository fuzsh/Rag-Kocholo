        "text": "Mary (Sunseri) LaBuda, age 96, formerly of Johnstown, died Saturday, March 23, 2019 in Omaha NE where she had lived with her daughter and son-in-law, Donna and Bernard Lichvar. For many years they took care of her with love and compassion. Our Mom was a devout Catholic who said thousands of rosaries in her lifetime. She will be remembered as a selfless Mother who always sacrificed her needs to the good of her family. The love she had for her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren was special to us all. She loved music and anything sweet.\n\nShe is the daughter of the late Marianna (Piazza) and Dominic Sunseri. She is preceded in death by her husband Michael (Spike) LaBuda and her loving daughter, Michele DeRosa. Her brothers and sisters, Michael Sunseri, Frank Sunseri, Samuel Sunseri, Anna Ciaravella, Marianna Cassat, Angela Sakmar, Rose Luden and Josephine Murphy preceded her in death.\n\nHer surviving children are Barbara Gibson, Donna Lichvar and Michael LaBuda and her grandchildren, Nicole Bennett, Jessica Castro, Bruce Lee Derosa and Michael DeRosa. She was blessed with 8 great grandchildren.\n\nMemorial Mass will be held at 10:00am on Tuesday, August 13, 2019 at St. Francis Church, 120 Barron Ave., Morrellville. A gravesite service will immediately follow at St. Stephen's Cemetary.\n\nPublished on August 1, 2019\n\nPlant a Living Memorial\n\nIn Memory of MaryHow does it work?\n\nSend Flowers: When Is the Ordering Deadline?\n\nNext-Day Delivery\n\nANY DAY OF THE WEEK\n\nOrder any time up till the day before\n\nSame-Day Delivery\n\nMON-FRI Order by 2:00PM\n\nSAT & SUN Order by noon\n\nMorning Delivery\n\nTUES-SAT Order by 3:00PM\n\nThe day before\n\nSAT & SUN Order by Saturday\n\nNote: These are general guidelines; some florists may not be able to operate within these timelines.
