        "text": "I am a New York-based Director of Photography originally from Miami, Florida. My work includes feature and short narrative, documentary, fashion, branded content, music videos, and artist moving image. My work has been showcased at Sundance FF, Tribeca FF, SXSW, Los Angeles FF, Atlanta FF, the Whitney Biennial… Clients include Harry Winston, Bobbi Brown, Calvin Klein, Converse, Rolling Stone, HBO, Netflix… My career began in lighting design for theater and performing arts. From there I gained expert experience in lighting and camera movement working as a gaffer, key grip, dolly grip, crane operator, and camera operator alongside master cinematographers such as Lisa Rinzler, Bradford Young ASC, and Michael McDonough ASC. During this decades long career in motion picture, I have worked with masters of the craft like Spike Lee, Arthur Jafa, Martin Scorsese, Andrew Dosunmu, Stephen Spielberg, and contemporary artists Leah Devun, Sabisha Friedberg, and Sasha Wortzel.\n\nComing of age embedded in the subcultures of Miami, I follow a vision that profoundly explores the unfolding complexities of meaningful stories. My path is informed by a deep sense of ethics, approaching any medium with dignity and respect and sensitive to the social political underpinnings of this work. With a diverse background in film, photography, music, and fine arts, I am guided by light and the ethereal into the essence of any subject."
