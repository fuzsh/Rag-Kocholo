This time around ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Slim⁠⁠, Mia, and Mitchell discuss the upcoming SUMMER slate of movies and why you might need to add them to your own watchlists including MaXXXine, Kinds of Kindness, Furiousa: A Mad Max Saga, and Longlegs just to name a few*.* They also look ahead outside the most popular movies and shuffle their watchlists just like old times.\n\n⁠⁠⁠⁠Weekend Watchlist – Updated Weekly list⁠⁠⁠⁠ > movies mentioned in this episode.\n\nChapters:\n\nOpening credits + The Fall Guy (00:00:00)\n\nSummer 2024 preview Top 10 through 3 (00:05:43)\n\nSummer 2024 preview Top 3 (00:30:55)\n\nOur summer watchlists (00:39:02)\n\nWatchlists shuffles (00:49:15)\n\nCredits: Recorded in Philadelphia PA, Newark DE and Los Angeles CA.

Brian, who had a golden ticket to the ceremony itself, recaps how it felt for his eyes to see Al Pacino announce, “My eyes see Oppenheimer!”, while Gemma and Mia recount their hectic day on the red carpet and evening in the press room—plus dancing with the Anatomy of a Fall lawyers at the afterparty. Finally, we invite our London correspondent/Best in Show newsletter extraordinaire George Fenwick to reflect on the awards season as a whole, and to submit his winning pick for the inaugural Bradley Moze (and Otis) Awards, named for our beloved cats who kept us grounded over the past few months.

Also, Mia and Brian debrief about the Dune: Part Two hype (Space melodrama! More worms! All hail Denis Villeneuve!) and its entry into the Letterboxd Top 250 at a miraculous number six. For the grand finale, riot grrrl rockers Sleater-Kinney make a special appearance, with Carrie Brownstein recounting her brief appearance in Todd Haynes’ Carol.

Brian meets his sporting hero Marshawn Lynch, and Mia settles in for a conversation with International Feature Spirit winner Justine Triet about the multiple languages of Anatomy of a Fall. Finally, Neil Hamburger himself (On Cinema’s Gregg Turkington, cast member in the John Cassavetes Award-winning Fremont) tells Mia and Gemma about the first award he ever won (and seems to keep on winning).\n\nChapters:\n\nOpening credits (00:00:00)\n\nNews (00:03:06)\n\nJustine Triet interview (00:33:34)\n\nWinner Winner Turkington Dinner (00:49:48)\n\nClosing credits (00:54:40)\n\nCredits: Recorded in Los Angeles.

The superstar sibling duo is behind the Best Original Song Oscar nominee ‘What Was I Made For?’, and Mia chats with them about hiding secrets in their devastating-but-hopeful tune, the music and movies that make them feel emotionally validated and Billie’s directing aspirations. There’s also some queening out over a mutual love of Andrew Scott in Fleabag and Sherlock—relevant because he and Billie are both nominated in acting categories at the Indie Spirits this year (him for All of Us Strangers, her for Swarm), and because Andrew is always relevant. London Editor Ella Kemp pops in as well for a BAFTAs debrief, sharing her interviews with Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Samantha Morton and Best in Show bestie Paul Mescal.\n\nChapters:\n\nOpening credits (00:00:00)\n\nBAFTA recap and red carpet interviews (00:01:43)\n\nBehind the curtain (00:23:36)\n\nBillie Eilish and FINNEAS interview (00:26:08)\n\nWinner Winner Chicken Run Dinner (00:45:29)\n\nClosing credits (00:59:40)\n\nSponsor: Sony Pictures\n\nCredits: Recorded in Los Angeles and London.

More ‘Help!’ arrives in the form of Sean Lennon, co-writer of the Oscar-nominated short War Is Over!, via his chat with our New York correspondent, Julia Barrett-Mitchell. Mia and Brian also recap their Oscars Luncheon experience, which involved press and A-listers alike getting starstruck by Messi the dog, who plays Snoop in Anatomy of a Fall (and was snubbed for Best Supporting Actor).

This special is structured like the book that it’s based on: in three acts. The main interview is with staff writer for The New Yorker and National Book Award finalist, David Grann, whose searing account of the Osage murders is the basis of Scorsese’s new film. We speak to not just Grann, but also include two bits from a roundtable interview with Scorsese himself, paired with Osage Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear. You’ll hear from Scorsese himself about adapting Grann’s book, then an in interview with Grann, wherein he talks at greater length about some of the broader history that he charts in his phenomenal book and about some of the Osage writing that made it into the film. And finally this special will close with some words from Chief Standing Bear about their trust in Grann and the trust that Scorsese had to earn.\n\nCredits: Recorded in Los Angeles and New York City; produced by Brian Formo, edited by Slim; features music from Robbie Robertson’s score for Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nLists & Links: Martin Scorsese’s Letterboxd account\n\nThe power of podcasting compels you to listen as the Letterboxd crew gathers for a roundtable discussion about The Exorcist.\n\nSlim⁠ puts on his seasonable vestments and welcomes ⁠Gemma⁠, ⁠Mia⁠, Brian and ⁠Mitchell⁠ into the Letterboxd Studio to walk down memory lane on their first-time watches, favorite moments, and much more.
