        "text": "Jessica Biel is trying to start a new movement by having snacks in the shower. The Candy star posted a TikTok at the end of 2023, which seemed to inspire users on the platform about the weird personal passion. Biel, 41, said in her video that she loves to eat and drink in the shower. However, the mother of two sticks to what she thinks are shower-appropriate items. Biel lists cereal, popsicles, yogurt, tea, and coffee as her favorites. As she noted, if it drops or melts, it can easily go down the drain.\n\nIn response to a fan, Biel made a follow-up video last week explaining how she tackles consuming in an environment that would get everything wet. The question that the fan posed read: “I need her to explain HOW she eats said ‘shower appropriate’ items without getting water in it??” According to her, a ledge is quite helpful for placing down coffee or yogurt in the middle of your wash. “It’s pretty simple, guys. You can do this,” she urged. “I find it deeply satisfying.” She then pointed out some obvious tips for the concerned fans flooding the comments, like keeping your mouth closed while chewing under the water. She concluded, “Enjoy your shower consuming.” While the admission seems weird to some fans, others — particularly moms — could relate. As one parent commented, “I got four kids, they eat my food, I stand behind this 100 percent since it’s the only place I have privacy.” Another agreed, “It’s the only place you can probably eat without having to share with kids.”\n\nStill, she didn’t sell some people on the concept of cereal shower snacks. “Cereal? Without Milk? Does the water get in the bowl?” a comment read. “[Too] many questions.” Fortunately, it’s not that serious. As Biel quipped in one of her captions, “(Shower) food for thought…” Seemingly appropriate, the actress’ TikTok bio reads: “I’m sorry in advance for anything I post here.”\n\nThese Celebrities Have March Birthdays\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
