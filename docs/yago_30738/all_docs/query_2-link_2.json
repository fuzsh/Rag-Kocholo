        "text": "Ice Spice is following her fellow “ice” rappers, Ice Cube and Ice-T, in exploring her thespian side, as the Bronx rhymer has booked a role in Spike Lee‘s next film, starring leading man Denzel Washington.\n\nAccording to Variety, the “Munch” rapper will appear in Lee’s upcoming English-language reinterpretation of the Akira Kurosawa crime thriller, High and Low, which was based on Evan Hunter’s (Ed McBain) 1959 novel, King’s Ransom. Ice Spice, born Isis Gaston, has reportedly already begun filming scenes for the upcoming flick.\n\nThe news comes one month after Oscar nominee Jeffrey Wright was confirmed to have also joined the cast.\n\nKurosawa’s High and Low follows an executive whose son is mistakenly kidnapped, leading to an extortion plot. It is currently unclear if Lee plans to stick to the source material, or give the story a bit of a twist.\n\nThe film will make for Lee and Washington’s fifth collaboration, following Mo’ Better Blues (1990), Malcolm X (1992), He Got Game (1998) and Inside Man (2006). High And Low is being developed and produced by A24, Escape Artists, and Mandalay Pictures, and was written by Lee and Alan Fox.\n\nThe flick is set to hit movie theaters before finding a home on Apple TV. A release date has yet to be revealed."
