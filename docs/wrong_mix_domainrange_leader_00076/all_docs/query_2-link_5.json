The Cabinet was the only body of the Transvaal Colony from the granting of responsible self-government by letters patent on 6 December 1906, and was superseded by the Transvaal Provincial Executive Committee of the Transvaal Provincial Council with Rissik as the first Provincial Administrator.\n\nCabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nPortfolio Minister Party Term start Term end Prime Minister\n\nMinister of Agriculture Rt Hon.
