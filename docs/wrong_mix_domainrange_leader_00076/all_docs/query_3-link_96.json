One might argue that, given the grant of self-government, this achievement owed less to the organizing techniques of Het Volk as a party, than to the numerical strength and the cohesion of the Boers as a community; but even so, the importance of Het Volk would be established as the expression, at the level of a political party, of these social facts. Coming into existence alongside other parties, before the introduction of self-government, Het Volk helped ensure that under the new constitution a fully fledged party system would function from the beginning.\n\nType\n\nArticles\n\nInformation\n\nThe Historical Journal , Volume 9 , Issue 1 , 1966 , pp. 101 - 132\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0018246X0002639X [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 1966\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Merriman's influence had been present at an earlier stage. At the end of May 1904 Smuts had written to him asking for information on the South African Liberal Association. This was an organization formed by Merriman in the Cape with the aim of attracting the broad support of English-speaking urban workers throughout South Africa. Smuts's aim was to create an organization (Het Volk?) on lines sufficiently broad to appeal to ‘British’ voters in the Transvaal. , Davenport, op. cit., chap, XII(ii)Google Scholar.\n\n65\n\n65 Aardt, Van, op. cit., p. 152Google Scholar ; Volkstem, 5 and 8 12 1906Google Scholar.\n\n66\n\n66 CO. 291/115, Selborne's despatch, 7 Jan. 1907.\n\n67\n\n67 , Spoelstra, op. cit., pp. 344–5.Google Scholar\n\n68\n\n68 For the results in full see Clough, E., The South African Parliamentary Manual (London, 1909), pp. 81–6Google Scholar , and Cd. 3528, pp. 162–6. Het Volk won all the country seats except Barber-ton, 3 Pretoria (urban) seats and 4 on the Witwatersrand. Of the 37 returned, 34 were official candidates and 3 Independents who supported the party. Including these Het Volk had 46 candidates in the field. The Progressives had 34 (winning 21 seats–20 on the Rand and 1 in Pretoria); the National Association 16 (winning 6–4 in Johannesburg and 2 in Pretoria); Labour groups 14 (winning 3 seats, all in Johannesburg); and there were 33 Independents, of whom only 2 were elected. In 10 constituencies Het Volk candidates were returned unopposed; in the 36 constituencies in which they were engaged in contests they polled 24,769 votes, compared to the Progressives' 17,449 in 34 constituencies. In the contested constituencies 68 per cent of the 90,057 registered electors cast their votes. In seats won by Het Volk the average percentage poll was 72 per cent; in seats won by the Progressives 66 per cent.\n\n69\n\n69 African 837 (March 1906), p. 9.\n\n70\n\n70 African 853, pp. 7-8, 11.\n\n71\n\n71 , Hancock, op. cit., p. 228Google Scholar ; Aardt, van, op. cit., pp. 140Google Scholar (Botha to Leyds, 21 Sept. 1906), 171.\n\n72\n\n72 CO. 291/112, West Ridgeway's memorandum attached to the report, 31 July 1906; CO. 291/102, West Ridgeway's minute on Selborne's despatch of 13 Aug. 1906; CO. 291/103, Selborne's despatch, 24 Sept. 1906 (see also May, Le, op. cit., p. 206)Google Scholar.\n\n73\n\n73 Unless H.

Selborne wrote: ‘The clear majority which Het Volk has won over all other parties combined, together with the defeat of Sir Richard Solomon by Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, has of course made it necessary for me to send for General Botha, and I have very little doubt that he will form a Ministry consisting mainly, if not entirely, of members of his own party’ (CO. 291/116, despatch, 25 Feb. 1907).
