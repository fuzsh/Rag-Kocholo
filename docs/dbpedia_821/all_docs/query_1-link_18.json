        "text": "I am an experienced physiotherapist who enjoys developing strong therapeutic relationships. I have a wide range of experience with different problems, but I have a particular interest in exercise rehabilitation of the knee (osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain, ACL injury rehab, running injuries), challenging tendinopathies and persistent low back pain. I am a keen runner and enjoy hitting the pavement where I live in Geelong, and along the trails around the surf coast.\n\nMy interest in knees guided me into a Masters by Research at La Trobe, which I completed in 2024. My research has explored the efficacy of treatment of patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA), and how people with PFOA make decisions about their treatment. I am also a tutor for GLA:D Hip and Knee, and GLA:D Back Australia, which sees me teaching on courses through La Trobe and Macquarie Universities."
