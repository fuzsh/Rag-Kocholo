(2d) 93 (Gen.Div.)\n\nImportant decision of the Ontario Court (General Division) dealing with what assets of the charity can be used to satisfy judgements against it\n\nCourt looked at definition of what constituted a donor-restricted trust fund which would then place the asset out of reach of creditors\n\nDetermined that for a true donor-restricted gift certain formalities must be complied\n\nPublic appeals for funds for a particular purpose are not considered to be a donor-restricted fund and therefore could be available to satisfy creditors\n\nSee an article by T. Carter on Donor Restricted Charitable Gifts: A Practical Overview @ www.wardlaw.on.ca for a more complete analysis of the consequences of the Christian Brothers decision.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This Legislative & Caselaw Developments That Effect Churches and Charities is distributed with the understanding that it does not constitute legal advice or establish the solicitor/client relationship by way of any information contained herein.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS\n\nCharities seldom give sufficient attention to organizational structural issues, particularly as they relate to national or international structures\n\nThere is frequently a difference between how the charity actually operates and the legal organizational documentation for the charity\n\nThis dichotomy can eventually result in potential confusion and possibly even litigation\n\nAvoiding exposure to liability and maintaining effective control over the goodwill of a charity are dependent upon putting an effective organizational structure in place that reflects how the charity operates\n\nAll Charities should review their organizational structure on a regular basis\n\nCharities that operate on a national or international basis particularly need to evaluate the effectiveness of their organizational structure to protect their assets and maintain control over member organizations\n\nStructural issues are relevant for any charity that is a part of a larger organization\n\nSee www.wardlaw.on.ca for more details on this topic in a paper entitled National and International Charitable Structures: Achieving Protection and Control\n\nB. THE NATURE OF A NOT-FOR-PROFIT CHARITABLE\n\nCORPORATION AND THE NEED FOR CONTROL\n\n1. THE RELEVANCY OF THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION\n\nNot every not-for-profit corporation is a charity, ie, a golf club is a not for profit corporation but is not a charity\n\nEvery charitable corporation, though, must by definition be a not-for-profit corporation\n\nA not-for-profit corporation is distinctive from a profit making corporation because it has members instead of shareholders\n\n2. THE LACK OF EQUITY IN A NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION AND THE CORRESPONDING NEED FOR CONTROL\n\nA not-for-profit corporation does not permit equity ownership in the company through the issuance of shares and therefore cannot be controlled by another corporation by the ownership of shares\n\nA not-for-profit corporation is controlled through its members, but the members cannot own the corporation through the purchase of shares\n\nThe control mechanisms for not-for-profit corporations must instead be created through establishing effective contractual relationships\n\nC. NATIONAL CHARITABLE STRUCTURES\n\n1. THE NATURE OF A NATIONAL CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION\n\n(a) The Basic Character\n\nA national charitable organization generally has operations that extend beyond the boundaries of one province but can also apply in the same province\n\n(b) The Distinction Between the National Chapter Model and the National Association Model\n\n(i) The National Chapter Model (ie. a single charity with chapters)\n\n(ii) The National Association Model (ie, many independent charities are associated with each other)\n\n(c) Confusion Between the National Chapter Model and the National Association Model\n\nMany religious charities operate without knowing whether they are organized as a National Chapter Model (ie, a single charity) or a National Association Model (ie, many independent charities)\n\nThis may result in confusion and increased potential for legal action , particularly with estate gifts\n\nWhere a National Association Model is utilized without adequate control provisions in place, it may result in the loss of control of a \"renegade\" member organization\n\n(d) The Pros and Cons of the National Chapter Model\n\n(i) The Pros of the National Chapter Model\n\nHigher degree of control can be exercised over chapters and branches\n\nGreater simplicity in operation on a national basis\n\nNo risk of losing control over the assets and goodwill of the national charity to a renegade member organization\n\n(ii) The Cons of the National Chapter Model\n\nAny liability claim against a chapter or branch will expose all of the assets of the national organization and its chapters by a successful claimant ie, there will result a \"deep pocket\" for successful plaintiffs to claim against\n\nPossibly increased expense from employment legislation, such as pay equity or employer health tax\n\n(e) The Pros and Cons of the National Association Model\n\n(i) The Pros of the National Association Model\n\nReduced liability exposure by containing liabilities within separate corporations\n\nThe liability risks of one member organization does not affect the assets of other member organizations or of the national governing association\n\nA separate Ontario corporation created only for Ontario operations can limit the jurisdiction of the PGT under the Charities Accounting Act and the Trustee Act of Ontario to Ontario assets only\n\nReduced expenses under employment legislation, such as pay equity or employee health tax\n\n(ii) The Cons of the National Association Model\n\nIncreased complexity in maintaining effective control over member organizations\n\nThis could result in the loss of control over a \"renegade\" member organization\n\nPotential loss by a national associations of its trade-mark rights through misuse by member organizations\n\nPotential for confusion in determining whether the beneficiary of a charitable gift is a member organization or the national governing association\n\n(f) Comments Concerning Choice of Organizational Models\n\nIncreasing risks of litigation necessitates that the National Association Model be considered for charities involved in higher risk activities, for instance, where children ministries are involved\n\nCharities that have low liability exposure may be better served through the enhanced control available from the National Chapter Model, provided that the increased costs from employment legislation is not too expensive\n\n2. THE STRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION MODEL\n\n(a) Internal Structure of the National Governing Association\n\n(i) Federal vs. Provincial Incorporation\n\nA national governing association should generally be incorporated as a federal corporation under the Canada Corporations Act\n\n(ii) Letters Patent Considerations\n\nObjects need to be national in scope\n\nObjects need to provide authority to establish and enforce national standards\n\nReligious charities should include a statement of faith in its letters patent\n\nLetters patent should include a broad investment power\n\nLetters patent should include a \"directed\" dissolution clause in favour of a charity that has similar objects\n\n(iii) By-Law Considerations\n\nAre different classes of membership required to reflect regional interests?\n\nIs the election of directors to be done by corporate members or by nominees?\n\n(b) Control Considerations\n\n(i) The Need for Control\n\nThe National Association Model requires that control be exercised through internal corporate documentation for member organizations as well as contractual and/or licence arrangements between the national governing association and member organizations\n\n(ii) Ex Officio Control Method\n\nThe ex-officio control method involves representatives from the national governing association being \"ex-officio\" members of the board of member organizations\n\n(iii) Franchise Control Model\n\nA franchisor/franchisee model utilized in a business context where a parent/subsidiary form of ownership of shares is not available can provide an effective model for a national governing association that is not able to control its member organization by \"owing\" the organization as a subsidiary\n\n(c) The Specifics of the Franchise Control Model\n\n(i) An Association Agreement for Member Organizations would include the following terms:\n\nA requirement that there be similar charitable purposes\n\nA statement that there be no partnership or joint venture arrangements\n\nThe length of term for the agreement with automatic renewals unless canceled\n\nThe basic requirements of the association relationship are specified\n\nThe rights that flow from the association relationship are specified\n\nA statements of when the association relationship will be terminated and the consequences that flow from such termination\n\nThe inclusion of a conflict resolution provision through mediation and/or arbitration\n\n(ii) Incorporating Documentation for Member Organizations\n\nStandard incorporating precedent materials could be attached as a schedule to the association agreement\n\nThe approval by the national governing association should be required for the incorporating documentation for a member organization\n\n(iii) Trade-Mark Considerations\n\nThe name and/or trade-marks of a charity is one of its most important assets and should be protected\n\nA trade-mark registration should be made for key trade-marks\n\nA trade-mark licence agreement is essential to protect a trade-mark by evidencing adequate control as required by the Trade-marks Act\n\n(iv) Copyright Considerations\n\nThere is a need to establish and/or clarify ownership of copyrights\n\nThere may also be a need for a copyright licence agreement with member organizations\n\n(d) Decentralization Through Utilization of the National Association Model\n\n(i) What is Meant by Decentralization?\n\nDecentralization involves a National Chapter Model (single charity) converting into a National Association Model (multiple charities) to enhance liability protection of assets\n\nDecentralization may be necessary if the national charity is involved in activities that have a high risk of exposure to liability, such as children ministries\n\n(ii) Considerations Involving the process of Decentralization\n\nNeed to properly document transfer of assets and liabilities in favour of each Member Organization\n\nThe transfer of real property should first require an environmental audit\n\nThe transfer of donor restricted trust funds needs to be documented and may require a consent order pursuant to the Charities Accounting Act\n\nThe terms of charitable trusts in old deeds must be complied with and will bind a subsequent transferee charity\n\n(e) \"Piercing the Corporate Veil\" and Multi-Corporate Liability\n\nThe concept of \"piercing the corporate veil\" could result in the assets of a national governing association being exposed to the liabilities of its member organizations\n\nOntario courts will not \"pierce the corporate veil\" unless there has been a complete domination by one corporation over the other corporation, as well as fraudulent or improper conduct, and damages result\n\nNotwithstanding the narrow case law, steps should be taken to avoid even the possibility of \"piecing the corporate veil\" by separating the legal and operational aspects of the national governing association from that of its member organizations\n\n3. THE STRUCTURE OF THE NATIONAL CHAPTER MODEL\n\n(a) The Internal Structure\n\n(i) Preliminary Considerations\n\nThe national organization and the Chapter Model is both the governing body as well as the single legal entity that carries on operations throughout Canada (or on a provincial basis)\n\n(ii) Federal vs. Provincial Incorporation\n\nA national organization based on a Chapter Model should be incorporated federally under the Canada Corporations Act\n\nA national organizations that is currently incorporated provincially should be very careful before attempting to a convert federally by the incorporation of a new federal corporation\n\n(iii) Letter Patent Considerations\n\nThe charitable purposes need to be national in scope\n\nThe charitable purpose needs to authorize activities being carried out through divisions i.e., through chapters or branches\n\n(iv) By-Law Considerations\n\nThe organizational by-laws for chapters or branches should be included as part of the by-laws of the national organization\n\n(b) Establishing the Structure of a National Chapter Model\n\n(i) Utilizing a Chapter/Charter Agreement\n\nThe utilization of a chapter/charter agreement would recognize that a chapter or branch is an operating division of a single national organization\n\nThe expectations and limitations in the operations of a chapter or branch need to be set out in a chapter/charter agreement\n\n(ii) Licensing Considerations\n\nLocal chapters need limitations concerning when or how the trade-marks and copyrights of the national organization can be used\n\nLicencing eliminates confusion over who owns trade-marks and copyrights\n\n(c) Liability Considerations Involving the National Association Model\n\nThe activities of a chapter or branch may expose all of the assets of a national organization as well as all of its chapters or branches to claims made against a single chapter or branch\n\nA national organization should implement effective risk management policies and procedures for chapters and branches to protect both the national organization and all chapters and branches\n\n(d) Utilization of a Parallel Foundation for the National Chapter Model\n\nA parallel foundation can be used to shelter assets of the national oganization and its chapters or branches\n\nA parallel foundation can also be used to attract long term endowment funds\n\nD. INTERNATIONAL CHARITABLE STRUCTURES\n\n1. THE GENERAL NATURE OF AN INTERNATIONAL CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION\n\n(a) The Challenge of Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions on an International basis\n\nThe sovereignty in each country requires that international operations be carried out through independent and autonomous charitable organizations in each country\n\n(b) The Dichotomy Between National and International Operations\n\nConfusion can result from the founding charity in one country acting as both the international parent as well as the domestic charity\n\nConfusion can result from the founding charity (often in the U.S.) attempting to impose its organizational structure and precedents on member domestic charities\n\n(c) Funding Issues with Revenue Canada Involving the Transfer of Monies Outside of Canada\n\nA Canadian registered charity must carry on charitable activities itself or through \"qualified donees\", otherwise the activities done through foreign charities must be carefully done in accordance with arrangements acceptable to Revenue Canada\n\nTransfer of monies to \"non-qualified donees\" requires that there be either an agency relationship, joint venture arrangement or co-operative partnership\n\n2. OPTIONS IN STRUCTURING AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION\n\n(a) Multiple Association Model\n\n(b) Subsidiary Model\n\n(c) Separate International Organization Model\n\n3. THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF A SEPARATE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION\n\n(a) The Benefits of a Separate International Organization\n\n- a separate international organization separates the international operations from the control of the founding charity\n\nthis permits better representational input from member domestic charities\n\nit also permits a central entity to own and control key assets on an international basis, such as trade-marks\n\n(b) Where to Incorporate a Separate International Corporation\n\nNeed to choose a stable county in which to incorporate\n\nInternational operational purposes needs to be recognized as being charitable at law\n\n(c) Letters Patent Considerations\n\nThe charitable objects need to be international in scope and authorize the establishment and implementation of international standards\n\nReligious charities should include statement of faith in the letters patent\n\nThe letters patent should include a direct dissolution clause in favour of a charity with similar objects\n\n(d) By-Law Considerations\n\nWho are to be the corporate members?\n\nPossible need to reserve veto rights in favour of the founding charity\n\nIs the election of directors to be done by corporate members or nominees from member organizations?\n\n4. IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL PROVISIONS\n\n(a) The Importance of Developing International Control Provisions\n\nThe lack of control provisions can result in a potential renegade domestic charity\n\nEffective strategic planning in international structure can avoid conflict, loss of control, and potential litigation\n\n(b) Utilizing the Franchise Control Model\n\nThere should be a single entity to act as the \"franchisor\" with each domestic charity acting as a \"franchisee\"\n\nControl can be effected through contractual and/or licencing arrangements between the \"franchisor\" and each domestic charity\n\n(c) The Specifics of the Franchise Control Model on an International Basis\n\n(i) The International Association Agreement would include:\n\nA statement of the international expectations for domestic charities\n\nAn explanation of circumstances leading to the termination of the International Association Agreement\n\nThe consequences from loss of association status would include the loss of the right to use the trade-mark and copyrights in the country of the domestic charity\n\n(ii) Incorporating Documents of the Domestic Charity would include:\n\nThe general terms of charitable purposes consistent with international charity\n\nA statement of faith consistent with international charity\n\nA right of approval of the international charity over changes in the constating documents of the domestic charity\n\nThe requirement for ex-officio participation of the international charity on the board of directors of the domestic charity\n\n(iii) Trade-Mark Licensing Considerations\n\nThe need to register trade-marks in each country that the international charity operates in\n\nThe international charity should be the owner of the trade-marks in each country and then licence the trade-marks to the domestic charity\n\nThe international charity needs to register internet domain names using as many domains as possible to \"occupy the field\" and preclude \"domain squatting\" by others\n\nThe international charity should also register geographic internet domain names for each country and then licence them to applicable domestic charities\n\nTrade-mark applications in some countries can be based on proposed use as well as actual use of the trade-mark\n\nA domestic charity may need to assign its trade-mark rights in favour of the international charity if the domestic charity has already acquired rights in the trade-mark\n\n(iv) Copyright Considerations\n\nOwnership of copyrights need to be clarified between international and domestic charities\n\nThe international charity may need to establish licence agreements for copyrights being used by domestic charities\n\n(v) Enforcing Control Provisions\n\nControl provisions are of little value unless they are enforced\n\n\"Use it or loose it\" applies to the time sensitive nature of protecting intellectual property rights\n\n5. LIABILITY ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\n\n(a) Exposure to Liability\n\nAgency and/or co-operative partnerships may lead to joint and several liability\n\nMultiple corporations may lead to liability if there are circumstances where the \"corporate veil is pierced\"\n\n(b) International Risk Management Considerations\n\nIt is important to review insurance policies for geographic limitations and the designation of the international charity and the domestic charities as co-insured\n\nThe need to allocate risk and utilize a release and/or indemnification agreement\n\nDISCLAIMER: This National and International Charitable Structures: Achieving Protection and Control is distributed with the understanding that it does not constitute legal advice or establish the solicitor/client relationship by way of any information contained herein.

Web Resource Materials on Y2K issues\n\nB. WHAT ARE THE BASIC Y2K ISSUES?\n\n1. ADOPT A CAUTIOUS APPROACH\n\nLike it or not, the Year 2000 (\"Y2K\") Problem or the \"Millennium Bug\" is difficult to ignore\n\nConsiderable litigation is speculated to result, but no one knows for sure whether Y2K is more \"hype\" than \"crisis\"\n\nDue diligence requires that charities become aware of the issues and take appropriate precautions as necessary\n\nCharities and churches cannot afford to simply do nothing\n\nDo not panic but be aware and be prepared\n\n2. WHAT IS THE Y2K PROBLEM OR \"MILLENNIUM BUG\"?\n\nThe Y2K Problem refers to the inability of computers, software and micro-processors to process date related information beyond December 31st, 1999\n\nThe Y2K Problem originates from using abbreviated date codes and allowing for only the last two digits of the year instead of all four\n\nWhen the year changes from 1999 to 2000, technology using two digits will see a change from 99 to 00 and programs may misinterpret 00 as 1900 instead of 2000\n\nThe Y2K is also a leap year which many computer applications may fail to consider\n\nIf systems are not rendered capable of dealing with Y2K, they may crash or fail to correctly compute information\n\nThe U.S. Government estimates that its Y2K costs alone to be thirty billion ($30,000,000,000.00) (U.S.) to achieve compliance\n\n3. WHAT DOES Y2K COMPLIANCE MEAN?\n\nA single definition of Y2K Compliance does not exist\n\nCompliance should include accurate and timely processing of date data using both single century and multi century formulas\n\nCompliance should include years 1999, 2000 and leap year calculations and recognition\n\nCompliance should include date and data communication and transfer capability\n\nCompliance should include the absence of malfunctions, logical or mathematical inconsistencies, or operational interruptions due to any data\n\nC. HOW THE Y2K PROBLEM MAY IMPACT CHARITIES\n\n1. COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCIES\n\nFailure to maintain records for Revenue Canada under the Income Tax Act\n\nFailure to maintain accounting records for the Public Guardian and Trustee of Ontario under the Charities Accounting Act (Ontario)\n\nFailure to maintain donor lists\n\nInability to produce charitable receipts to donors\n\nInability to maintain financial statements for audit purposes\n\nFailure to maintain records of charitable trust funds\n\nFailure to maintain investment records for surplus monies and charitable trust funds\n\nFailure to maintain records involving international charitable activities through third parties, ie, agents, co-joint venture participants, partners or international projects\n\n2. HARDWARE DEFICIENCIES\n\nComputers have internal clocks that record the time and date\n\nBoth older models and some newer model computers still record the years with two digits\n\nSome computers can be corrected by a change to the basic input/output system (BIOS)\n\nSome computers may be too old to be fixed and will need to be replaced\n\n3. SOFTWARE DEFICIENCIES\n\nMany computer software may not work properly after the Year 2000\n\nVendors should be contacted to see if the software program can be updated to correct Y2K deficiencies before the Year 2000\n\n\"Detonation method\" of testing for Y2K compliance by setting the computers clock to January 1st, 2000 might result in software programs shutting down, software licenses expiring, and date reminders disappearing\n\nAccounts payable/receivable and payroll software may not properly work\n\nRecords retention and retrieval system software may not properly work\n\n4. DATA STORAGE DEFICIENCIES\n\nData storage using a two digit format will not work properly after the Year 2000\n\nSoftware is generally available to update data handling programs but is not fool proof\n\n5. TELECOMMUNICATION DEFICIENCIES\n\nTelephone switching equipment and voice mail may not work properly after the Year 2000\n\nNeed to check with manufacturer about the Y2K compliance of equipment\n\n6. ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES\n\nVaults, security and safety systems, sprinkler systems, HVAC, lighting and elevators may not properly function after the Year 2000\n\nD. THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE Y2K\n\nPROBLEM FOR CHARITIES\n\n[Excerpted in part (with permission) and modified as necessary from the Canadian Bar Association in \"Countdown To 2000 - The Legal Issues\"]\n\n1. OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR CHARITIES\n\nY2K compliance by third parties\n\n- consider what steps should be taken to determine the Y2K compliance status of third parties, such as suppliers or other charities involved in joint projects\n\nY2K representations and commitment to third parties\n\n- consider what Y2K representations and commitments, if any, should be provided to third parties or to donors about charitable activities\n\nDisclosure obligations and financial statements\n\n- consider what disclosure of Y2K compliance, if any, should be made in the financial statements of the charity\n\nInsurance coverage\n\n- consider the extent to which Y2K risks can be insured under an existing policy, if at all, and what steps should be taken to protect against or extend coverage\n\nRisk management\n\n- consider whether steps should be taken to appoint an appropriate Y2K project management team to address the risks\n\nStaffing and personal\n\n- consider the implications of the Y2K Problem on staffing and labour relations\n\nExpert assistance\n\n- consider whether to seek advice from outside consultants and advisors\n\nDelegation of the Y2K duties\n\n- consider to what extent the board of director's responsibility to deal with Y2K Problems can be delegated to a committee of the board or to outside advisors\n\nProtection of privilege and confidentiality\n\n- consider what steps should be taken to ensure that the confidentiality and privilege of Y2K information is preserved\n\n- it may be advisable to use legal counsel to protect Y2K reports with a solicitor client privilege\n\n2. CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS\n\nWho owns the affected software?\n\n- consider whether the charity owns the software it uses or has licences for\n\nAccess to software source codes\n\n- consider who can modify a source code for customized software\n\nIs software warranted to be Y2K compliant?\n\n- consider whether existing software licence agreement, maintenance support agreements and outsource agreements contain a warranty stating that the software is Y2K compliant or, if not, will be modified as necessary\n\nDoes the charity have contractual rights to modify software itself?\n\n- for licensed software, consider whether the software license precludes modifications without the prior consent of the software vendor\n\nIs software vendor offering assistance?\n\n- consider whether the software vendor is offering assistance to make the software Y2K compliant and what warranties are being offered in this regard\n\nInsurance contracts\n\n- consider whether a charities insurance may cover the cost of determining a major Y2K Problem under an existing insurance policy\n\nProtection of outstanding loans\n\n- if the charity has loaned money then consider how it can protect its rights, and security if the borrower is likely to face significant risks associated with Y2K\n\n4. MAINTENANCE OF RELIABLE RECORDS FOR EVIDENTIARY PURPOSES\n\nWill a Y2K Problem compromise the integrity of the records of a charity to an extent that it will render those records inadmissable in evidence in future litigation?\n\nCharities should consider the extent to which an organization's inability to defend against or prosecute civil claims may occur because of a lack of a reliable evidentiary source\n\nE. WHAT IS THE EXPOSURE TO LEGAL LIABILITY FROM Y2K?\n\n[Excerpted in part (with permission) and modified from the Canadian Bar Association in its\n\n\" Countdown To 2000-The Legal Issues\"]\n\n1. STATUTORY SOURCE OF LIABILITY\n\nConsider the statutory requirements that may be breached by lack of Y2K compliance\n\nIncome Tax Act and electronic record keeping requirements\n\nIncome Tax Act and requirements in issuance of charitable donation receipts and records\n\nCharities Accounting Act (Ontario) and maintenance of accounting records for charities in Ontario\n\n2. PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY\n\nConsider whether charities are subject to organizational obligations and duties as members of a national or international association that may be impacted by Y2K non-compliance\n\nie, failure to produce regular financial statements and reporting requirements to a national or international association\n\n3. CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY\n\nConsider what contractual obligations may be affected by Y2K Problems\n\n- - i.e., direct or implied contracts to provide goods or services, technology, or equipment\n\nCharities should identify the specific contracts and issues that may result in liability\n\n4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIABILITY\n\nConsider whether remedial action undertaken to achieve Y2K compliance may infringe, breach, contravene or misappropriate intellectual property rights of others\n\n- ie, the Copyright Act will generally require the consent of software owners\n\n5. CONFIDENTIALITY LIABILITY\n\nConsider whether technology and software data that is subject to confidentiality obligations will be impacted by Y2K Problems or Y2K Corrections\n\nConsider whether the disclosure of, or failure to adequately protect information constitutes a breach of privacy rights, ie, failure to protect donor lists\n\n6. DIRECTOR AND OFFICER'S LIABILITY\n\nDirectors and officers may be exposed to personal liability for failure to exercise due diligence in undertaking remedial steps to avoid Y2K Problems\n\nDirectors and officers may be accountable to their corporate members, Revenue Canada, and to the Public Guardian and Trustee of Ontario for breach of fiduciary duties of directors in their roles as \"quasi trustees\"\n\nDirectors and officers may be exposed to breach of trust for improper investment of charitable funds if the income or the investment is lost through Y2K Problems\n\n7.

INTRODUCTION\n\nDespite popular belief to the contrary, the Internet is not lawless. It is governed by all of the same laws which affect us in our daily lives\n\nMaintaining a web site can expose a church or charity to a variety of criminal and civil sanctions if it is not careful\n\nThe following are a number of areas of concern for church and charity web site owners\n\nB. COMMENTARY\n\n1. TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION: \"WHOSE LAWS DECIDE?\"\n\nThe Internet is international in nature\n\nWhat a church or charity posts on its web site can be viewed anywhere in the world\n\nWhat a church or charity posts on its web site may expose it to the laws of potentially any other jurisdiction anywhere else in the world\n\nIssues of which jurisdiction is applicable is a relevant at present - the high degree of uncertainty in determining the applicable jurisdiction should lead to wariness for church and charity web site owners\n\n2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS\n\nAll intellectual property laws are applicable to the internet including copyright and trade-mark law\n\nUnauthorized use of material created by someone else, may expose a church or charity to an action for copyright infringement\n\nTrade-mark law is applicable to web sites. If a church or charity makes use of the trade-mark of another without its' permission, whether to establish a hyperlink, a meta-tag, or to promote the services of the church or charity, then the church or charity will likely be exposed to an action for trade-mark infringement\n\nObtaining necessary releases and licenses important for web site owners to reduce the chances of litigation\n\n3. DOMAIN NAME DIFFICULTIES\n\nArea of contention and uncertainty at present\n\nIf the domain name is the trade-mark of another then a church or charity may expose itself to an action for trade-mark infringement\n\nAt the same time, taking appropriate steps to secure its domain name is highly recommended to churches and charities\n\nIf a church or charity fails to act, it may find itself having to purchase its domain name from someone who had the prescience to register it first\n\n4. CIVIL ACTIONS ON THE INTERNET\n\nInclude defamation (libel and slander), interference with economic interests, passing-off, trade-secrets and breach of confidence, and negligence\n\nDefamation can occur easily on the Internet. E-mails can not be considered as privileged or private communication. Bulletin Boards and Chat Rooms allow the disenchanted to defame others\n\nChurch and charity web site owners should carefully review anything posted to their sites, or they may find themselves publishing defamatory material\n\nUse of a web site to criticize the business practices, wares or services of others can lead to actions for interference with economic interests if such use leads to contracts being breached\n\nPassing-off can occur if a web site is used to promote goods or services in the name of another, or if the web site is designed to prosper from the goodwill of another organization or individual\n\nTrade-secrets can be passed easily over the internet, and breaches of confidence can easily occur through inappropriate use of e-mail, or improper security measures\n\nNegligence can include statements posted on a web site which are relied upon by others to their detriment, in situations where it would be expected that such reliance would occur\n\nSome recommendations to reduce problems\n\n(a) Vicarious liability of employers for actions of employees - limit employee access to the web site;\n\n(b) Limit access to the web site to invited guests;\n\n(c) Regularly monitor what is posted on your web site;\n\n(d) Use security measures; and\n\n(e) Use disclaimers;\n\n5. CRIMINAL ACTIONS ON THE INTERNET\n\nCriminal law is applicable to the internet\n\nIssues of jurisdiction important for criminal law - area of uncertainty\n\nIncludes illegal speech, criminal libel and gaming\n\nIllegal speech involves s.319 of the Criminal Code\n\nIllegal speech includes: \"Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace\" and \"every one who, by communicating statements other than in private conversation, willfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group\" is guilty of an offense\n\nCriminal libel is defined as \"a matter published, without lawful justification or excuse, that is likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that is designed to insult the person or, or concerning whom it is published\"\n\nGaming and betting is regulated through numerous applicable sections in the Criminal Code\n\nGenerally, gaming is prohibited unless regulated by a provincial government, while section 207(4) (c) basically requires that any lottery scheme using a computer be operated by a provincial government\n\nIssues of jurisdiction significant when dealing with gaming\n\nMichigan statement on jurisdiction over internet - indicates that Michigan will try individuals under Michigan law is offer gambling over the internet to Michigan residents\n\nThe same recommendations as outlined in the section dealing with civil law issues apply with respect to criminal law issues\n\n6. AREAS OF SPECIFIC CONCERN\n\nA number of web site design practices have recently engendered litigation in the United States, and should be avoided where possible. These include the following practices\n\n(a) Hyperlinking without permission to other web sites\n\n(b) Hyperlinking to pages on another web site, which are below the home page of the other web site\n\n(c) Using a meta-tag which is the trade-mark of someone else without their permission, in order to draw searches to your web site\n\n(d) Using 'framing' technology in order to pass of f the material of another web site, which has been hyperlinked into the frame, as your own, or in combination with your own promotions and advertisements\n\n(e) Spamming - mass e-mail distribution -- can lead to civil actions for damages as well as the anger of recipients\n\nC. CONCLUSIONS\n\n1. SOME EASY RULES OF THUMB\n\nFirstly, don't use what is isn't yours, or attempt to gain benefit from the work of others without first obtaining their permission;\n\nSecondly, ensure that you use your web site in a civil manner, always with an eye to how\n\nothers will receive what you have to say;\n\nRemember to maintain control over how your web site is being operated;\n\nEnsure that only a limited and trusted number of employees have access to what is placed on your web site;\n\nMaintain confidentiality of information obtained and used; and\n\nOperate your web site with an eye to the effect that it will have throughout the world, and not just in Canada or the United States.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This summary of Web Site Issues: The Law and What You Need to Know is distributed with the understanding that it does not constitute legal advice or establishing the solicitor/client relationship by way of any information contained herein.
