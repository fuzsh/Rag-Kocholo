        "text": "We used BlastP to search for sequences related to the Microsporidia conserved protein family # c_456 (Nakjang et al., 2013) which contains the Nematocida spp. putative NupG-like nucleoside/H+ symporter (Cuomo et al., 2012), in the genomes of Microsporidia and their endoparasitic relatives among the Rozellomycota (Corsaro et al., 2016), including species of Rozella (James et al., 2013), Mitosporidium (Haag et al., 2014) and Amphiamblys, (Mikhailov et al., 2017). Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that Rozellomycota is a paraphyletic group containing a ‘core Microsporidia’ clade (Corsaro et al., 2016), although others have argued for a different taxonomy with an expanded definition for the Microsporidia (Bass et al., 2018). The core Microsporidia (the term we use here) contains all the species traditionally classified as Microsporidia and which share diagnostic features of the group, including a coiled polar tube, a polaroplast, and the absence of a mitochondrial genome (Corsaro et al., 2016; Mikhailov et al., 2017). A total of 63 members of the protein family c_456 were identified among the Rozellomycota and core Microsporidia (Figure 1—source data 1). Phylogenetic analysis including homologues from prokaryotes and eukaryotes recovered the Microsporidia transporters as a separate clade with homologues from Mitosporidum, Amphiamblys and Rozella (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2); providing evidence that the genes were present in the common ancestor of these species. Homologues of the Microsporidia proteins were also detected in other eukaryotes including free-living fungi, Oomycetes, Metazoa, Euglenozoa, Alveolata and Stramenopiles. The broad distribution of the genes across major lineages of eukaryote including free-living species suggests that this family of transport proteins may be ancestral among eukaryotes. In particular, the tree topology provides no compelling support for an origin of the Microsporidia genes through LGT from prokaryotes as previously suggested (Cuomo et al., 2012), and there is no evidence from the tree for a specific relationship to the E. coli NupG and XapB (Nakjang et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2004) transporters (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2).\n\nFigure 1—source data 1\n\nMFS protein sequences from Microsporidia and Rozellomycota analysed in this study.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.008\n\nFigure 1—source data 2\n\nMFS homologues from the family c_456 (Nakjang et al., 2013) encoded by the genome of two recently sequenced Rozellomycota species.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.009\n\nDetailed phylogenetic analysis identified two clades (A and B) of Microsporidia proteins (Nakjang et al., 2013) originating from a gene duplication in the common ancestor of the core Microsporidia and some Rozellomycota (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Clade A contains at least one copy from every Microsporidia genome sampled. Clade B contains sequences from most Microsporidia apart from the Encephalitozoon/Nosema/Ordospora and Enterocytozoon/Vittaforma lineages, which appear to have lost the genes for these transporters (Figure 1). The majority of the Microsporidia sequences from clade A contain an indel (insertion or deletion) between the 7th and 8th transmembrane domains (TMD) compared to other proteins (Nakjang et al., 2013) (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The indel is between 16 to 38 residues long (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) apart from one of the paralogues from Anncaliia algerae which has lost most of the indel (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The sequences from Rozella, Mitosporidium and Amphiamblys at the base of clade A do not possess the indel (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Clades A and B both contain evidence for further lineage-specific duplications affecting some Microsporidia (Figure 1). For example, in clade A, T. hominis and some other microsporidian genomes encode only a single gene, whereas others have multiple paralogues (Figure 1, Figure 1—source data 1). In clade B, T. hominis has three paralogues, whereas other species have only a single gene or appear to have lost their clade B homologue altogether (Figure 1). This type of lineage-specific gene duplication is a feature of the evolution of other Microsporidia transporters (Nakjang et al., 2013) providing the raw material (new genes) for functional divergence among paralogues (Dean et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2014).\n\nWe used the four T. hominis sequences and related proteins from Microsporidia and Rozellomycota as search queries in HMMer searches against the Pfam domain database (Figure 1—source data 1). The Microsporidia members of clade A, one sequence from Mitosporidium daphniae and four from Rozella allomycis matched the MFS profile PF03825 found in nucleoside/H+ symporters including E. coli NupG. This profile did not match any of the other transporter homologues, including the proteins from Amphiamblys sp. (Figure 1—source data 1). Microsporidia sequences from clade B were characterised by matches to the more general MFS transporter profiles MFS_1 (PF07690) and MFS_2 (PF13347) (Figure 1—source data 1). The alignment for the indel in sequences from clade A did not generate a significant hit (all e-values ≥ 13) in a HHPred profile-profile search of gene families in the protein domain databases (data not shown). The Microsporidia MFS transporters are predicted to have 12 alpha helical TMD, with both termini facing the cytoplasmic side (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). This is a typical conformation (Reddy et al., 2012) as previously reported for the E. coli NupG and XapB nucleoside/H+ symporters (Nørholm and Dandanell, 2001; Vaziri et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2004) and is consistent with the Microsporidia proteins being functional MFS transporters.\n\nIn summary, all the Microsporidia proteins are members of the major facilitator family (MFS) of transport proteins, but there is no compelling evidence for a particularly close relationship to NupG, or strong indication from trees or bioinformatics concerning their substrates or transport mechanisms. In the rest of the manuscript we refer to the four T. hominis transporters as T. hominis ThMFS1-4 with the following locus tags and uniprot accessions (Heinz et al., 2012): in clade A, ThMFS1: THOM_0963 - L7J × 55; in clade B, ThMFS2: THOM_1192 - L7J × 19; ThMFS3: THOM_1681 - L7JVD0; ThMFS4: THOM_3170 - L7JT12.\n\nWe used RNA-Seq and measured transcript abundance (expressed as transcripts per million, TPM) at six time points representing different stages in the parasite lifecycle, during a synchronised intracellular infection of rabbit kidney (RK13) cells by T. hominis (Dean et al., 2018). ThMFS1 mRNA was characterised by a relatively high abundance at the first time point (3 hr) followed by a gradual decrease at 14, 22 and 40 hr (Figure 2A) and then a dramatic increase after 40 hr during spore formation (70 hr) and maturation (96 hr), when it was the most abundant ThMFS mRNA (peaking with a mean value of 363 TPM, Figure 2A). A previous RNA-Seq analysis of a sample taken at a late time point in a T. hominis infection of RK13 cells, also identified ThMFS1 as the most abundant transcript among the four ThMFS genes (Watson et al., 2015). By contrast, the expression profile of ThMFS3 mRNA peaked during the early stages of infection at the 3 hr post-infection time-point (238 TPM), and gradually declined to about 50% of this level by the 22 hr time point (Figure 2A). ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 were both characterised by significantly lower levels of transcript abundance throughout the infection, with mean levels at all time points below 19 TPM. Relative expression profiles for ThMFS1-4 (Figure 2B) further emphasise the contrasting levels of transcripts for the different transporters during infection. Published RNA-Seq data for other Microsporidia (Cuomo et al., 2012; Desjardins et al., 2015; Grisdale et al., 2013) show similar patterns in the expression of paralogous MFS-like genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). For example, the Vavraia culicis orthologue of ThMFS1 (Figure 1) shows its highest expression during spore formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and the V. culicis orthologues for ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 (Figure 1) have the lowest levels of transcription (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Based upon the branch lengths in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 are evolving much faster than ThMFS3 (Figure 1) and ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 also have the highest number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the ThMFS homologues (Figure 2—source data 1). Previous work (Dean et al., 2018) on the T. hominis NTT (ThNTT) demonstrated a similar reciprocal relationship between the degree of ThNTT sequence conservation (expressed as tree branch lengths) and expression levels, with the fastest evolving ThNTT paralogues showing the lowest expression levels. Comparing ThMFS and ThNTT (Dean et al., 2018) transcript abundance indicated that ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 are characterised by higher levels of expression than ThNTT1-3 throughout the time course of the experiments (Figure 2—source data 2). Notably, ThNTT4 is characterised by the highest level of transcripts among all ThMFS and ThNTT transporters, with mean TPM values of >1000 across six different time points of the synchronised infection (Figure 2—source data 2) (Dean et al., 2018).\n\nFigure 2—source data 1\n\nSNP analysis of the ThMFS1-4 ORFs.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.020\n\nFigure 2—source data 2\n\nTranscriptomics data for ThMFS1-4 and ThNTT1-4 transporters.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.021\n\nFigure 2—source data 3\n\nQuantifications of IFA signals for ThMFS1-4 and mitHsp70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.022\n\nWe made anti-peptide (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) rabbit antibodies for each of the four T. hominis MFS transporters and used them in immunofluorescence assays (IFA) of infected cells grown on slides and sampled at different time points (Figure 2C). Each slide was co-incubated with rabbit antisera from one of the ThMFS (red) and rat antisera to T. hominis mitochondrial Hsp70 (ThmitHsp70) (green), with the latter labelling parasite mitosomes and acting as a control for the fixation and permeabilization protocol (Freibert et al., 2017; Goldberg et al., 2008). DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (blue) was also added to stain parasite and host nuclear DNA (Figure 2C). During intracellular infection (Field et al., 1996) the surface plasma membrane of T. hominis is exposed to the host cell cytosol or to the lumen of an intracellular compartment called a sporophorous vesicle (SPOV) (Cali and Tokvarian, 2014). In the infective spore stage, the plasma membrane is protected from the external environment by a thick spore coat (Vávra and Lukeš, 2013). The antisera to ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 gave clear and specific labelling of the surface of parasites consistent with a plasma membrane location (Heinz et al., 2014) in samples taken during the time course of infection (Figure 2C). By contrast, no parasite specific IFA signals were detected for the antisera to ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 at any stage of the infection cycle, despite observing consistent labelling of the mitosomes and nuclei of parasites (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). The reasons for the lack of ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 signals are not known but the expression levels of these two genes were much lower than for ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 (Figure 2A), so it is possible that the antibodies we used were insufficiently sensitive to detect expression in our model system or the proteins were not expressed under the experimental conditions used. Consistent with these possibilities, the antisera for ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 gave no parasite-specific signal in western blot analyses on total protein extracts from T. hominis infected RK13 cells and T. hominis spores, in contrast to the strong signals for antisera to ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 5). The antisera for ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 also generated relatively weaker signals against the peptides used as antigens in dot blots suggesting the antibodies may be ineffective (Figure 2—figure supplement 6).\n\nThe antisera for ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 showed different patterns of parasite labelling during the infection (Figure 2C), suggesting that they have evolved functional differences following gene duplication, as previously shown for the paralogous NTT transporters of T. hominis (Dean et al., 2018). We detected no labelling of the parasite surface by the antisera to ThMFS1 in replicate slides at 3 hr post-infection, despite transcript levels for the gene being relatively high at this point (Figure 2A) and clear labelling of mitosomes and nuclei on the same slides (Figure 2C). The ThMFS1 antisera gave strong labelling of the surface of parasites at 14 hr, 22 hr and 40 hr post-infection (Figure 2C). At 70 hr and 96 hr post-infection, strong signal was located in the SPOV membrane surrounding groups of T. hominis (Figure 2C) sporonts and spores (Hollister et al., 1996; Watson et al., 2015). This suggests that ThMFS1 has a role in supporting parasite development within the SPOV. The spores inside the SPOV were not labelled with either of the antibodies or by DAPI, suggesting that the developing spore coat may exclude access of these reagents. A lack of signal from spores in these types of experiments has previously been observed using antibodies to the ThNTT transporters and to several mitosomal proteins (Dean et al., 2018; Freibert et al., 2017; Goldberg et al., 2008). Proteomics data for purified T. hominis spores (Heinz et al., 2012) has shown, however, that ThMFS1 is present in spores. We detected strong parasite surface labelling by antisera to ThMFS3 from 3 hr up to 40 hr post-infection, but no labelling by antisera to ThMFS3 of either parasites or SPOV membrane in slides for 70 hr and 96 hr (Figure 2C). The absence of signal for ThMFS3 on the surface of mature vegetative cells at 70 hr appears to be stage specific because fields of highly infected RK13 cells that contain a mix of mature and early stage parasites (through reinfection), show strongly labelled smaller cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 7). Labelling of small cells characteristic of earlier time points, with antisera for ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 at 96 hr post-infection, are also consistent with the initiation of new infections from germinating newly differentiated spores (Figure 2—figure supplement 8). Consistent with the absence in IFA of a detectable signal for ThMFS3 in the later stages of parasite development, ThMFS3 was not detected in proteomics data for purified T. hominis spores (Heinz et al., 2012).\n\nUpon their discovery, it was suggested (Cuomo et al., 2012) that the Nematocida homologues of ThMFS transporters might be purine and pyrimidine nucleoside transporters like the E. coli NupG transporter. NupG has a broad specificity for nucleosides (Nørholm and Dandanell, 2001; Patching et al., 2005; Vaziri et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2004) including the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (Nørholm and Dandanell, 2001; Xie et al., 2004). We used heterologous expression in E. coli strains (Dean et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2014; Tsaousis et al., 2008) to test if the ThMFS1-4 proteins could transport radiolabelled uridine, using the E. coli NupG transporter as a positive control. Because expression of eukaryotic proteins in bacteria can be improved by codon optimisation in the bacterial host (Gustafsson et al., 2012) we tested expression of native and E. coli codon-optimised ThMFS in different E. coli strains. The E. coli strain GD1333, which lacks the two endogenous nucleoside transporters NupG and NupC (Nørholm and Dandanell, 2001), was used as the expression host in these assays (Figure 3A). In contrast to the positive control expressing recombinant NupG, none of the ThMFS proteins transported [14C]-uridine above background levels for the empty vector control (ptrc99a) (Figure 3A). These data suggest that uridine is not a substrate for transport by ThMFS1-4.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3—source data 1\n\nRaw data and their processing to calculate the transport of the tested nucleoside or nucleotides by ThMFS1-4 and control transporters expressed in E. coli (worksheet 1: panels A and B; worksheet 2: panel C).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.024\n\nWe recently characterised the substrate specificities and evolution of a family of Microsporidia nucleotide transport proteins (NTT, Pfam profile PF03219) that import ATP and GTP for parasite growth and replication inside infected host cells (Dean et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2014). These transporters (family # c_336 in Nakjang et al., 2013) are also members of the MFS protein superfamily (clan CL0015; Dean et al., 2018). To investigate if the structural similarity between the ThMFS and NTT transporters is reflected in their transport properties, we tested if the ThMFS proteins could transport radiolabelled purine and pyrimidine nucleotides when expressed in E. coli (Figure 3B and C). All four ThMFS transported ATP above background, whereas E. coli expressing NupG did not transport ATP (Figure 3B). Further experiments demonstrated that all four ThMFS proteins can also transport radiolabelled-GTP, but not radiolabelled-CTP or UTP (Figure 3C). Consistent with the specific uptake of [α32P]-ATP and [α32P]-GTP, uptake of both substrates by E. coli cells expressing ThMFS transporters was time-dependent (Figure 4). Our data demonstrate that ThMFS1-4 can transport purine and thus their substrate specificity overlaps with that of the previously characterised Microsporidia NTT nucleotide transporters (Dean et al., 2018; Heinz et al., 2014). The lack of a positive control in these assays makes it difficult to interpret the negative results for transport of the two tested pyrimidines.\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4—source data 1\n\nRaw data and their processing to calculate the transport of the tested nucleotides by ThMFS1-4 expressed in E. coli (worksheet 1: panels A and C; worksheet 2: panels B and D).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.026\n\nThe E. coli NupG transporter is a H+ symporter that uses a proton gradient to drive the transport of uridine and other nucleosides (Xie et al., 2004). We have previously shown that some Microsporidia NTTs have evolved into symporters (Dean et al., 2018) capable of mediating the net import of nucleotides. To test if nucleotide uptake by ThMFS proteins is also proton dependent, we investigated [α32P]-ATP and [α32P]-GTP uptake by ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 are the most abundant transcripts in RNA-Seq (Figure 2A) and both are detected on the cell surface of actively growing parasites (Figure 2C). The addition of CCCP had no effect on nucleotide uptake by E. coli expressing ThMFS1 or ThMFS3 (Figure 5), suggesting that they are not H+-symporters. By contrast, CCCP did inhibit import of nucleotides by Protochlamydia amoebophila PamNTT5, a known H+-symporter of GTP (Haferkamp et al., 2006) (Figure 5). The nucleotide transport activity of some Microsporidia NTT (e.g. ThNTT4) were previously shown to be sensitive to CCCP treatment in the same expression system (Dean et al., 2018).\n\nFigure 5—source data 1\n\nRaw transport data and their processing to investigate the impact of the protonophore CCCP on nucleotide import in E. coli expressing ThMFS1, ThMFS3 or the control PamNTT5 (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47037.029\n\nPrevious studies have shown that Microsporidia lack the genes needed to make primary metabolites including nucleotides, and that they have a limited capacity to make their own energy (Dean et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2014). This raises the question of how these intracellular parasites obtain the enormous amounts of ATP and other nucleotides that they need to support their rapid growth and replication. For example, it is suggested that it takes at least 109 ATPs (Phillips and Milo, 2009) to make a single E. coli, and the ATP requirement to make the larger cells of Microsporidia is likely to be considerably higher. Previous work suggests that Microsporidia can use surface-located NTT nucleotide transporters to import purine nucleotides including ATP and GTP during their intracellular growth (Dean et al., 2016; Dean et al., 2018; Tsaousis et al., 2008). In the present study, we show that Microsporidia have a second set of MFS transporters that they can potentially use to supplement their energy and nucleotide budget. Thus, all four T. hominis ThMFS transporters were able to transport ATP and GTP when expressed in E. coli (Figure 3C), and the two most highly expressed proteins (ThMFS1 and ThMFS3) are present on the surface of parasites (along with the NTTs; Dean et al., 2018) when they are most actively growing inside infected rabbit kidney cells (Figure 2C). The functional relevance of the transporters ThMFS2 and ThMFS4 is unclear as we were unable to detect any evidence of their protein expression in our model system.\n\nIt was originally suggested that the Nematocida homologues of the T. hominis ThMFS transporters might have similar transport properties to the E. coli MFS NupG (Cuomo et al., 2012). NupG is an MFS H+ symporter that uses the proton gradient to drive transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (Xie et al., 2004). However, as we show in the present study, the levels of shared sequence similarity between NupG and Microsporidia sequences are generally low. Moreover, characterised members of the MFS superfamily that includes the Microsporidia sequences and NupG, transport a broad spectrum of ions and solutes using a variety of different mechanisms (Yan, 2015). This diversity makes it difficult to make reliable functional inferences based upon sequence similarity (Finn et al., 2016; Saier et al., 2016; Yan, 2015). This is exemplified by recently published data (Dean et al., 2018) for Microsporidia NTT transporters where substrate and mechanism vary among closely related paralogues (Dean et al., 2018). In this study, we show that ThMFS1-4 do not transport uridine, a known pyrimidine nucleoside substrate of NupG (Xie et al., 2004), and that ThMFS1 and ThMFS3, are not inhibited by CCCP, a classic inhibitor of H+ symporters like NupG (Xie et al., 2004). Moreover, although T. hominis has a putative uridine kinase (Heinz et al., 2012), most Microsporidia genomes appear to lack the kinases needed to utilise uridine and other nucleosides in their metabolism (Dean et al., 2016), even if they could import them.\n\nIn recent years, a number of endoparasitic microbial eukaryotes related to Microsporidia have been identified and their genomes sequenced (Galindo et al., 2018; Haag et al., 2014; James et al., 2013; Mikhailov et al., 2017; Quandt et al., 2017). Phylogenomic analyses suggest that these taxa form a monophyletic sister group to the true fungi, for which the name Rozellomycota has been suggested (Corsaro et al., 2016), and that core Microsporidia form a distinct clade within Rozellomycota (Galindo et al., 2018; Mikhailov et al., 2017; Quandt et al., 2017). Like the Microsporidia, many of the Rozellomycota lack genes for making nucleotides de novo and some have a limited capacity for making their own ATP (Dean et al., 2016; Dean et al., 2018; Galindo et al., 2018; James et al., 2013; Mikhailov et al., 2017; Quandt et al., 2017). This suggests that they all depend to some degree upon host energy and nucleotides for their own intracellular growth and replication. Recent work has shown that Rozella and Microsporidia possess horizontally acquired nucleotide (NTT) transport proteins that they can use to import host ATP, and in the case of Microsporidia other purine nucleotides and NAD+ (Dean et al., 2018). The topology of the NTT tree (Dean et al., 2018) suggests that NTT transporters were acquired by lateral gene transfer into the common ancestor of Rozella and Microsporidia and subsequently vertically inherited (Dean et al., 2018; Major et al., 2017). Analysis of the draft genomes of Amphiamblys sp. (Mikhailov et al., 2017), Metchnikovella incurvata (Galindo et al., 2018), Mitosporidium daphnia (Haag et al., 2014) and Paramicrosporidium saccamoebae (Quandt et al., 2017), suggest that they lack NTT genes. Based upon the topology of published trees (Dean et al., 2018; Galindo et al., 2018; James et al., 2013; Mikhailov et al., 2017; Quandt et al., 2017) which place these species as internal branches of the Rozellomycota, it appears that they have lost NTT genes during their independent evolution. By contrast, all these species contain multiple homologues of the ThMFS transporters (Figure 1, Figure 1—source data 2) suggesting that these transporters provide an alternative and hitherto unrecognised way for endoparasites to exploit the host nucleotide pool.\n\nThe same T. hominis infected RK13 cells used for the synchronised infection experiments (see RNA-Seq section) were also grown on 13 mm glass coverslips and then fixed in methanol/acetone (50:50 at −20°C for at least 10 min) (Dean et al., 2018; Goldberg et al., 2008; Heinz et al., 2014; Tsaousis et al., 2008) at the different time points post-infection. Rat antisera against ThmtHSP70 (locus tag THOM_3057) were used to label T. hominis mitosomes and both host and parasite nuclei were stained with DAPI, as previously described (Dean et al., 2018; Freibert et al., 2017; Goldberg et al., 2008; Heinz et al., 2014; Tsaousis et al., 2008). Dilutions of antisera were as follows: anti-ThmtHSP70 1:200; anti-ThMFS1-4 1:50. For anti-ThMFS2 and anti-ThMFS4 1:10 and 1:2 dilutions were also tested but no IFA signal was observed in any of the tested conditions. For ThMFS1 and ThMFS3 both rabbit antisera gave parasite-specific IFA signals. Blocking and antibody incubations were performed in 5% milk prepared from skimmed milk powder in PBS, with PBS used for washing steps. Cells were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes) and mounted in Vectashield Hard set (VectorLabs). Peptide competition assays were performed with the addition of solubilized pairs of peptides in a 200-fold molar excess compared to the affinity-purified antibody. The IgG molar mass was considered as 150,000 Daltons, and the molar masses of the blocking peptides were taken into consideration for the calculations. For ThMFS1, the final antibody concentration was 5.2 μg/ml and the concentrations of peptide 1 and peptide 2 were 13.6 μg/ml and 11.2 μg/ml, respectively. For ThMFS3, the final antibody concentration was 3.3 μg/ml and the concentrations of peptide 1 and peptide 2 were 8.3 μg/ml and 8.5 μg/ml, respectively. As expected, the control mitosomal ThmitHsp70 signal was not affected by any of these conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 9). Images were taken with a Zeiss Axioimager II epifluorescence microscope using a 63x objective lens and images processed with ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Quantification of the ThMFS antibody fluorescence signal was determined for fields including intracellular stages of the parasite. Axiovision software and Image J[Fiji] with the Bioimport plugin was used to determine relative fluorescence for each specific antibody including the mitosome-specific antibody to mitHsp70. Background signal was determined in a similar manner and subtracted from the specific signal."
