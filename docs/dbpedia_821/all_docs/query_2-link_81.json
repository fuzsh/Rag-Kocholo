See ‘Meaning & use’ for definitions, usage, and quotation evidence.\n\nhalfpenny has developed meanings and uses in subjects including\n\nHow common is the noun halfpenny?\n\nAbout 0.3occurrences per million words in modern written English\n\n17504.717604.817704.617805.217905.018004.418103.918203.718303.018402.618502.418602.418702.318802.218902.019001.819101.519201.319301.019400.8519500.6819600.5319700.4419800.3619900.320000.2620100.26\n\nHow is the noun halfpenny pronounced?\n\nBritish English\n\nHAYP-nee\n\nHAY-puh-nee\n\nU.S. English\n\n/ˈheɪp(ə)ni/\n\nHAYP-uh-nee\n\nHAFF-pen-ee\n\nWhere does the noun halfpenny come from?\n\nThe earliest known use of the noun halfpenny is in the Middle English period (1150—1500).\n\nOED's earliest evidence for halfpenny is from around 1200, in West Saxon Gospels: Luke.\n\nhalfpenny is formed within English, by compounding.\n\nEtymons: half adj., penny n.\n\nNearby entries\n\nEtymology\n\nSummary\n\nFormed within English, by compounding.\n\n< half adj. + penny n. Compare earlier halfpennyworth n.…\n\n< half adj. + penny n. Compare earlier halfpennyworth n.\n\nNotes\n\nCompare Middle High German halpphenninc, and (in different sense, with reference to shared profits) Middle Low German halfpenninc. Reduced pronunciations such as /ˈheɪpni/ remain frequent (and in British English usual) in most uses, even when the word is written halfpenny (as also for the plural forms halfpennies and halfpence); for the phonology, see discussion at half adj. The plural halfpennies (now historical) refers to the individual coins only; halfpence is usually collective, or expresses the sum however made up. Possible earlier currency in Old English. Earlier currency is probably implied by the (11th-cent.) composition date of quot. c1275 at sense 1a, and perhaps also by halfpennyworth n. Compare also (in different sense) Old English healf pening, denoting half a pennyweight (compare penny n. II.6), in which the first element is treated as a normal adjective inflected for case and number.\n\nMeaning & use\n\n1.a.\n\nOriginally: a coin of the English (later British) currency of half the value of a penny; the amount represented by this, a sum equivalent to two farthings. Later (from 15 February 1971 until 1984): the smallest coin of British decimal currency, having the value of half a new penny, or \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{200}\\) of a pound; the amount represented by this. Also: a similar coin or amount in the currency of another country, e.g. Scotland or Ireland before they became part of the United Kingdom, or Ireland between 1928 and 1986.\n\nSilver halfpennies were first issued during the reign of Edward I (1272–1307), and continued to be minted until the time of the Commonwealth (1649–60). Copper halfpennies were first struck during the reign of Charles II (1660–85); after 1860 they were of bronze. As no copper pennies were struck until 1797, the halfpenny was the only copper coin in circulation for some time and the plural form halfpence came to be used colloquially to refer to copper or bronze coins collectively.\n\nAfter the decimalization of British currency in 1971, halfpenny was often written as two words and pronounced British English /ˌhɑːf ˈpɛni/ , U.S. English /ˌhæf ˈpɛni/ . The British decimal halfpenny was demonetized on 31 December 1984, and now the sum, when reference to it is necessary, is more usually denoted by half a penny, or (in writing) ½p or 0.5p.\n\nIn earliest use apparently as a unit of account or perhaps alluding to the practice of cutting silver pennies into halves to obtain a lower denomination.
