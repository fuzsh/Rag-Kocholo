        "text": "‚ùóToday, Microsoft announced that outbound marketing will be removed as of June 30, 2025. To avoid any business continuity issues, all customers still using outbound marketing must transition to real-time journeys before this date. ‚ö†Ô∏èThey will also remove social posting and LinkedIn lead generation capabilities on December 2, 2024. Microsoft don‚Äôt plan to support social posting in real-time journeys because it has low demand and usage. We're considering adding LinkedIn lead generation to real-time journeys in a future release. üì¢ I've made an update to the D365 Marketing Weekly newsletter to make sure the latest announcement from Microsoft is included. üîó\n\nThis post is about using a combination of D365 Marketing (Customer Insights ‚Äì Journeys), Microsoft Clarity, Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics and tracking visitors to your website from the email sent out in your Journeys. Using these tools, we can review recordings and heatmaps for visitors that have come to our website specifically because they clicked on a link in one of your emails. This will leverage the UTM tracking functionality in Realtime marketing. So let‚Äôs get started! https://lnkd.in/entGkcv2 #Clarity #GoogleTagManager #GA4 #D365Marketing #CustomerInsightsJourneys\n\nThe issue for this week is ready to go! It‚Äôs a very short one this week! Just a couple of items for you, but important ones to check out. Do you know of anyone new who has started blogging in this area? If so, let me know! ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/emgcUsWX Content from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Community, ServerSys - Warren Butler. #D365Marketing #CustomerInsightsJourneys #RealtimeMarketing #Marketing\n\nIt's been a while, anyone fancy helping with a little test for some blog prep? This one is to provide the ability to filter your recordings and heatmaps in Microsoft Clarity based on visits to your site from your Contacts and Leads, and give you filtering options in Google Analytics. üî•üî•üî• To help me out, just click on the link and enjoy the website for a moment or two. That's it. ü•∞ https://lnkd.in/eyJiHHci üöÄ Blog post out next week, hopefully with some traffic and insights to show. #MicrosoftClarity #GoogleAnalytics #D365Marketing #RealtimeMarketing #Insights\n\nYES!!! THANK YOU! Sorry Microsoft but this has to be one of THE MOST ANNOYING 'features' you've come up with. Thankfully there is a way to turn off those suggestions in D365 that just aren't helpful 99.99999% of the time. Thanks for sharing Jeroen Scheper! #CoPilotNoPilot"
