        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nQuality control guideline TG142 1 recommends that the coincidence of radiation and mechanical isocenters, as well as imaging and treatment isocenters, should be verified annually. The assessment of coincidence of radiation and mechanical isocenters is difficult to perform directly since the mechanical isocenter is traditionally determined using gantry and couch‐mounted mechanical pointers 2 and graph paper, and the radiation isocenter is determined by means of the Winston‐Lutz (WL) test 3 with a ball‐bearing (BB) phantom, historically with radiosensitive film and nowadays with the electronic portal imaging detector (EPID). 4 In the WL test, the BB phantom, representing a target, is attached to the patient support table and aligned to the treatment isocenter. EPID images of the BB phantom are then acquired with the collimated beam at various gantry and collimator angles and analysed in terms of deviations of the radiation field centers from the BB phantom (i.e. beam isocentricity).\n\nLiu at al. 5 presented an improved version of the mechanical and radiation coincidence test, using a special EPID (BIS 710) sensitive to light and radiation that significantly reduces the measurement uncertainty. However, the mechanical isocenter was assumed to be represented by the optical isocenter (light and crosshair system), which might not be the case. An alternative and less complex method is to utilize the laser system (used for initial patient positioning) as the reference coordinate frame. In that case lasers are first aligned to the mechanical pointer adjusted to represent the mechanical isocenter. Rosca et al. 6 presented a high accuracy method of verifying the laser system alignment with the radiation isocenter using phosphor plates. The method also provides characteristics of the radiation isocenter geometry, similar to that achieved with the commonly used WL test and ball‐bearing phantom. However, the method is still relatively time and resource intensive.\n\nLetourneau et al. 7 discussed how to assess accurately the alignment of the radiation beam axis with the three independent mechanical axes of rotations of the collimator, the gantry and the couch based on an analytical model, custom‐made phantoms and analysis software. However, the mechanical isocenter location was not defined, and therefore the coincidence of radiation and mechanical isocenters could not be unambiguously determined.\n\nZhang et al. 8 considered carefully the issues related to having various linac isocenters, commonly referred to as those for mechanical, radiation and imaging systems, depending on how the isocenter position is determined. They presented a theoretical framework of the linac isocenter starting from fundamental concepts of a definition expressed mathematically. They also recommended that the linac mechanical isocenter, called in brief ‘linac isocenter’, should be used as the reference isocenter and that the other isocenters should be aligned with it, including the treatment isocenter. Zhang et al. 8 asserted that there should be one ‘center of collimation’, that is common for all Beam Limiting Devices (BLD) (e.g. MLC, diaphragms, cones) since all BLDs can be calibrated against this reference ‘center of collimation’. This approach is only effective when the focal spot position (point of the electrons hitting the target) is aligned with the collimator axis of rotation i.e. the focal spot offset (FSO) is zero.\n\nThe effect of FSO was first reported by Lutz et al. 9 They noticed that a transverse beam spot offset caused the radiation field positions to shift laterally, which resulted in two radiation fields at two opposed gantry angles to be misaligned (‘FSO effect’).\n\nSonke et al. 10 and Slama et al. 11 demonstrated that the focal spot position for both Elekta and Varian linacs is changing at beam start‐up and hence depends on the MU delivered (i.e., beam on time). On average the beam position stabilizes after 10 MU for Truebeam linacs and about 20 MU for Elekta and older design (Trilogy, iX) Varian linacs.\n\nNyiri et al. 12 considered the dependency of the x‐ray shadows of radio opaque rods on the distance of the rod from the radiation source. They observed that when the focal spot is not aligned with the collimator axis of rotation the distance between the two centers of the images formed by projected x‐ray shadows of two rods positioned at different distances from the radiation source is dependent on the collimator angle. They proposed the image center shift method to correlate geometrically the FSO (DFSO) and the distance between the two image centers (ΔFSO). The centers of the images were calculated as the average position of projected x‐ray shadows of the two rods, respectively (placed at distances d1 and d2 from the radiation source), while rotating the collimator, and were measured using the EPID (placed at a distance dEPID from the radiation source):\n\nΔFSO/DFSO=(dEPID/d2‐dEPID/d1)\n\n(1)\n\nIn practice, this means that the FSO effect causes the difference between radiation field centers to vary depending on the FSO value, the position of the BLD forming the field aperture and the position of the measurement plane (i.e., EPID). Chojnowski et al. 13 explored the FSO effect for a clinically relevant example of the Elekta Agility MLC calibration procedure, where the reference calibration position is determined using two BLDs (i.e., the MLC and diaphragms) that are physically at different distances from the radiation source. They reported a correlation factor of 0.7 between the MLC calibration error and the FSO scaled back from the EPID level to the isocenter level, i.e., if the FSO is 0.2 mm, it results in an MLC miscalibration of 0.14 mm.\n\nThe FSO effect is larger when the difference between distances of the BLDs to the radiation source is larger. The correlation factor between the WL test and the FSO for the Elekta linac with the Agility head is approximately 1.8 (see Eq. (1), [dEPID/d2(MLC) – dEPID/d1(BB)] * [dISO/dEPID]; dEPID = 160 cm (EPID positioned at 160 cm from the radiation source), d1(BB) = 100 cm (ball‐bearing positioned at the isocenter), d2(MLC) = 35.5 cm (MLC positioned at 35.5 cm from the radiation source), dISO = 100 cm (scaling back to the isocenter)). If the radial 1 FSO for an optimized beam on Elekta linacs is about 0.2–0.3 mm, 13 , 14 this would result in about 0.4–0.5 mm shift of the radiation isocenter longitudinally1 from the mechanical isocenter. Therefore, nowadays, the radiation isocenter is often used as the treatment isocenter, not the mechanical isocenter as in the past, and the two major linac manufacturers (Elekta and Varian) use it in their proprietary procedures to calibrate (align) the imaging systems’ isocenters. This approach does not, however, eliminate the FSO effect as such, but just minimizes it. If stereotactic treatments are performed with cones, the treatment isocenter defined by the MLC and diaphragms is different compared to the radiation isocenter collimated by the cone due to the FSO effect, as will be illustrated in the Methods and Results below.\n\nTo eliminate the FSO effect, the authors expanded the theoretical Zhang et al. 8 concept of the ‘center of collimation’ to be more practical and include the requirement for the FSO to be zero (i.e., include the FSO correction). Therefore, the concept of the ‘central axis of collimation’ is proposed here (referred to as the collimator CAX), commonly known as the collimator axis of rotation, and also that all radiation beam collimation axes (referred to here as the beam CAX) as well as all BLDs should be aligned with it.\n\nThe collimator CAX position is very reproducible 15 and the authors agree with the recommendation of Zhang et al. 8 that all radiation and imaging isocenters should be aligned to the stable mechanical isocenter. 16 However, there are no published methods describing how to position the BB phantom precisely at the mechanical isocenter so that it can be used to assess the alignment of linac isocenters utilizing a common WL test.\n\nNyiri et al. 12 presented the image center shift method, as mentioned above, to measure the FSO and to localize the collimator CAX at the EPID level with a jig comprising two rods, however, the procedure can only be used at gantry angle 0° due to the nonrigid design of the jig. Riis et al. 14 designed a special rigid phantom with two BBs that is conceptually similar to Nyiri’s jig but can be used at any gantry angle. However, neither the BB phantom nor the EPID can be placed at the linac isocenter due to the collision risk with the bulky phantom.\n\nThis study expands the work of Nyiri et al. 12 and Riis et al. 14 to localize the collimator CAX using radiation, utilizing a phantom of a different design and a modified method to guide the BB phantom to the mechanical isocenter. The mechanical isocenter position is defined in this study using the ‘collimator axis trajectory’ approach proposed by Skworcow et al., 16 which means that the mechanical pointer axis is utilized, instead of the mechanical pointer end, where the latter is common in standard approaches. It is important to emphasize that differences between mechanical isocenters determined using ‘collimator axis trajectory’ and standard approaches may be over 1 mm. The ‘collimator axis trajectory’ approach is more clinically relevant and conceptually similar to the radiation isocenter determination approach.\n\nIn this work, a method is proposed to localize the collimator CAX and the mechanical isocenter using radiation and was validated against varying radiation beam parameter settings of energy and MU. Based on the findings, three examples of procedures for specific linac quality assurance (QA) assessments were developed and presented, namely:\n\nCoincidence assessment of mechanical and radiation isocenters\n\nStereotactic beam isocentricity assessment\n\nComprehensive assessment of linac geometrical performance\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nComprehensive assessment combines many individual recommended tests such as coincidence of mechanical and radiation isocenters, coincidence of treatment and imaging isocenters, isocenters sizes as well as the end‐to‐end IGRT QA test.\n\nThe proposed methods are relatively fast and efficient. The basic coincidence assessment procedure consisting of attaching the FSO phantom and delivering the FSO field sequence with one energy, takes about 20–30 min. Determination of the radiation isocenter characteristics is performed using radiation fields defined by MLC and diaphragms and at the same time the mechanical isocenter characteristics can be determined using the FSO phantom. The efficiency comes from the fact that the congruence assessment between those two isocenters is done in a single process automated by the linac hardware and the IHD software.\n\nIt may be noted that, of course, the couch positioning, axes, limitations, and deviations are also an integral part of the overall geometric uncertainties of the system for the practical applications considered, e.g., stereotactic treatments. However, these can be assessed separately and are not evaluated here, since we are primarily concerned with the geometric behavior of the linac itself.\n\nIn the presented comprehensive assessment example, the uncertainty of determining the mechanical isocenter position and size are 0.05 mm and 0.04 mm, respectively, and the uncertainty of determining the radiation isocenter position and size are 0.36 mm and 0.12 mm respectively. This demonstrates that the applied methodology of localizing the mechanical isocenter is effective and precise compared to the normally used methodology for the radiation isocenter. This is because the localization of the radiation isocenter position (as opposed to the mechanical) depends on the energy, collimation, and MU i.e., is sensitive to adjustments of beam characteristics such as mean photon energy, FSO, start‐up beam stability.\n\nIt is recommended that the mechanical isocenter position should be used as the reference linac treatment isocenter. This approach is in line with the recommendation by ‘AAPM Medical Physics Practice Guideline 8.a.: Linear accelerator performance tests’ 19 in which the appropriate method should be established during the linac acceptance/commissioning to define the (linac) isocenter position in an appropriate reference frame that assures required accuracy at the radiotherapy clinic.\n\nThe linac isocenter size is a very important linac specification parameter that is used for acceptance testing, especially if the linac is planned to be used for SRS/SBRT treatments. The mechanical isocenter size shows minimal variation with the energy and no variation with the BLD (see Table ) and is therefore recommended to be used for linac acceptance testing, with other isocenters referenced to it.\n\nLocalizing mechanical isocenter position with the use of the BB phantom helps in setting‐up or independently correcting linac radiation and imaging isocenters. Namely, the BB phantom should be positioned at the mechanical isocenter. All radiation isocenter positions can then be adjusted to be aligned with the mechanical isocenter by appropriate beam steering in the radial direction as well as radiation isocenters sizes can be minimized by appropriate beam steering in the transverse direction.\n\nThe image guidance system can also be calibrated (or referenced) at the same time using the BB phantom. That methodology would assure congruence for all linac isocenters i.e. mechanical, radiation, and imaging. Moreover, if any of the linac isocenters drifted it can be adjusted accordingly without the need to affect, adjust, or calibrate other isocenters.\n\nThe Elekta proprietary procedure for localizing the radiation isocenter, as part of the kilovoltage (kV) imager flexmap calibration process, 18 uses a predefined field sequence called ‘kV FlexMap Cal. MLC160’. This sequence differs from the FSO sequence, since it uses four gantry angles (instead of five) and 12.5 MU per field (instead of 50 MU). The Elekta sequence designated for localization and alignment assessment, must therefore be used with caution, since low MU per field and lack of data from the fifth gantry angle might substantially alter the radial beam CAX position for each gantry angle, affecting longitudinal isocenter localization.\n\nIn the hypothetical scenario where the FSO is zero and there is no MLC or diaphragm sag at any gantry angle it would result in a zero value BO, eliminating the FSO effect, and guaranteeing alignment of mechanical and radiation isocenters. However, this might not be the optimal linac set‐up since the gantry sag and the collimator tilt causes the mechanical and radiation isocenter sizes to be nonzero. Also, treatment planning systems assume that the radiation isocenter size is zero. Therefore, for linacs designated for SRS/SBRT, it is advantageous to correct the transverse beam steering to minimize the radiation isocenter size at the cost of reintroducing a small FSO effect in the transverse direction. A practical guide for optimizing beam steering for SRS/SBRT linacs is the subject of future study."
