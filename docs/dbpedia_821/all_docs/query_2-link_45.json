        "text": "Have you ever f**ked up at work? I mean, properly f**cked up? To the point you consider going into hiding, such is the blush-inducing agony of it all? I have. I dumped it to a world-class standard on one occasion in my career. And I’ve decided to tell you about it. I’ve written on here about several money-making success stories I’ve been a part of over the years. But I’ve never shown you the other side of those coins. It feels unnatural; like folding your arms the wrong way (go on, give it a try). I’m sure, like me you’ve sat in many a business briefing where the leader of said business was asking for more innovation; welcoming, almost encouraging the failure new ideas can sometimes bring, their words accompanied by a quote to give them added gravitas. Like the Woody Allen one: “If you’re not failing every now and then, it’s a sign you’re not doing anything very innovative.” Yeah, cheers boss, but I have a feeling if I do fail, you might just fire me for it! Fortunately for me, when I dropped my uber-clanger, the P45 didn’t follow. Nevertheless, it’s taken me to my eleventh article to tell you about it. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to think back and remember the lessons learned, as they shaped so much of what followed for me, and you might just find them useful too. Right, curtain closed, shutter open, let the confessional begin. “Forgive me friends, for I have failed.”\n\nIt was 2012. Remember that year? I think of it as ‘Peak Britain’, such was the sense of pride & togetherness at the time, spearheaded by our hosting of the Olympics & Paralympics. And within weeks of the cauldron being lit in East London, I re-opened one of three Beefeater restaurants we’d converted to a new version of the proposition we were trialling. Beefeater? Yeah I know, not the sexiest brand in the sector, but it made good money and we’d seen an opportunity to make more by re-connecting the brand with its roots in steak. In its heyday, it had been famous for this, but in more recent times lost its way. Now brace yourself, here comes a highly retro piece of advertising featuring TV grumpy-bloke Geoffrey Palmer to make the point.\n\nI imagine there was a version on the cutting room floor where she chinned him. But while his delivery may have dated, it turned out the thrust of Geoffrey’s point had not. When we did our homework, we discovered steak was still a compelling food hook for the brand. It was a treat, people didn’t feel confident cooking it at home and with all the cuts & styles of preparation available, there was so much to be explored. The level of love among existing guests for what we currently offered felt low, so the risk of change felt equally so. Gaucho & Hawksmoor were thriving, Flat Iron had just got going and we could see a gap in the mass-market for a steak focused enterprise. Easy then. We’ll hook back onto steak, make that the focus of everything we do and re-invent our offer accordingly. Eating beef was in our name, after all. We also played into the British DNA of the brand, reflecting this in our tone of voice and across parts of the menu, particularly the puddings. The changes we made were significant. A radically simpler menu, updated kitchen & cooking platform, new restaurant design, a revised service style and overhauled end-to-end experience, all wrapped up in new branding, and all built around steak. Here, take a look.\n\nWe converted our three chosen sites over in a matter of days - in Ashford, Birmingham & Burton – and couldn’t wait to see how much everyone loved what we’d done, such was our confidence in the whole venture. Cue the needle scratching off the vinyl. The first few days of trade signalled all that was coming. The speed of reaction was faster than anything I’d seen before. Did we attract new guests? Yes. Did we lose herds of the guests we already had? Yes. Netting one off against the other, did our sales go backwards at a rate of knots? Yes – by a good 30%. Gulp. The Beefeater natives were restless. Perhaps my most telling moment was in Ashford as I sauntered across the newly refurbished restaurant, just in time to hear a regular guest asking my colleague \"What idiot has made all these changes?\" Yep, that would be me sir. Now that was a sobering conversation. And once I’d taken the time to reflect on what he’d said, I couldn’t disagree with him. But like an overcooked rump, it was hard to digest.\n\nNow I had been prepared for failure several years earlier. While working at Egg, we’d been coached by a chap called David Pearl on using the skills of theatre & performance to inspire an audience and drive action. One of the techniques he shared centred on how live performers recover when things inevitably go wrong. So there we were in groups of three, throwing a long stick to each other, vaguely wondering what this actually had to do with our job. \"Pass it with a flourish, try and get some finesse into your throw…\" said David as he encouraged us, before inevitably one of our group dropped the stick. \"And freeze!\" he said. The penny dropped – we were in the money business after all. There we were in various contorted states of panic. It’s human instinct to flinch when something goes ‘wrong’. David’s point was simple and one I’ve never forgotten. Learn to celebrate dropping the stick. React positively, not negatively. And in this particular instance, shout at the top of your voice and with a big smile \"I’ve dropped the f**cking stick!\" He actually made us do that. It was such a powerful insight. And now a good decade down the line, here I was much in need of it. So I stood in the middle of that restaurant in Ashford and shouted “I’ve just dropped the…\" No, don’t worry, I didn’t. But I did take time reflecting and learning from the whole experience of failure, and I want to share a few of my key insights with you now. What did I learn?\n\n1. Eat one bite at a time: On a practical level, it’s smarter to trial new ideas in one place and extend from there. When you have several trials live from the get-go, any errors you’ve made are multiplied, and if there are significant issues to solve that only makes it worse. You spend as much time fire-fighting as you do learning. Start small, learn & fail fast, then extend from there. Incubating in one place makes it easier to gather with the team and learn alongside them too. Going a little slow(er) to go fast really does work.\n\n2. Beware of false comforts: Research won’t tell you everything. It can be misleading. All our insights suggested what we had would be a slam-dunk success, but research rarely tells the whole story. How many groups would wagamama sail through as a concept given all the rules it breaks? But look now successful it’s been. Research has its place, but needs balancing with instinct and the views of people around you – the more angles you look at it from, the more you see, the better the result.\n\n3. It’s good to talk: Now there’s an iconic ad-line from the 90’s. But it’s true. And talking to the people that actually run your business is essential. If I’d taken more time to do that, I’d have heard many of the issues we experienced played back before we created them. Numerous CMO’s have gone before you, each fizzing with new ideas. Your colleagues have seen this and carry the insights (and scars) with them. All you need to do is ask. And of course it means when the changes do land, they own them with you.\n\n4. Value what you have: Don’t take your existing guests for fools. Was our brand perfect? No. But did people already enjoy what they were spending their money on? Yes. And that loyalty must be retained to grow. This is in part an ‘ownership’ thing. In the 80’s, Coca-Cola changed their recipe to a disastrous reception, coming to realise they were playing with something people felt they owned. It was much the same here. It’s amazing what a VIP preview evening does to engage existing guests, even when most of the changes are the same. Sometimes, all people need is to be asked.\n\n5. Choose your leaders carefully: The people at the top of your pile matter. In my case, they were Paul Flaum (MD) & Andy Harrison (CEO). I can recall vividly the ExCo meeting where I shared the performance on these trials. I was mortified. Andy’s reaction? He paused, met my gaze and said \"Ok, well it’s going to take a little longer to crack this, so make sure you have enough in the tank to trade the business while you do that, don’t lose your nerve and keep going.\" I already knew Paul was equally supportive. Their attitude was pivotal in giving me the courage to drive forward. And it worked.\n\n6. Learn to celebrate dropping the stick: Now you can only do this one if the leaders above you are the right ones – otherwise, you most likely get fired for the sheer insolence! But David was right. When you feel comfortable to embrace your ‘mistakes’, it changes the tone and flow of the conversation, removes any awkwardness and gives everyone the freedom to learn and make changes. Less time covering up, more time moving forward. So start rehearsing your speech for when the time comes.\n\nThere, six of the best – I figured that would be enough for one sitting. How did this sorry tail all turn out? Well we listened, learned and put our best foot forward a few months later - this time in Leicester - and our revised formula worked brilliantly. A sharpened restaurant design & layout, some gentler changes to the menu and softened branding did the trick, supported by better comms with our loyal guests. This is where we landed.\n\nWithin a couple of years, the new Beefeater proposition had been rolled out nationally, including back into those first three sites we’d converted. That is a seventh lesson actually. Be sure to go back to fix what you started. If you don’t, what signal are you sending to anyone considering being the first in any future trials? Our success here led to the development of Bar + Block, our high street steak format. That proved to be a phenomenal success, and was all built on the insights from that initial failure. So I guess Woody was right after all.\n\nI opened with a provocative question, accentuated by a double-use of the f-word (see what I did there). But if we’re to view the things we learn from innovation in those potty-mouthed terms, little will move forward. Repeatedly making the same mistakes is careless and worthy of that dreaded P45. Trying new ideas in the pursuit of something better is to be lauded & applauded. The key lies in daring to try. Ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky famously lamented he missed 100% of the shots he never took. Just as stars of elite sport perfect their art as their career extends, so we all find better ways to finesse our own shots on goal as we progress through life. Taking a plunge that risks sharing our weaker side will rarely feel comfortable, a risk amplified by the tide of social media we’re washed down with each day – a swell of people’s best bits that creates an illusion of perfection in a world that is anything but. Sometimes you just need to mess things up a bit; land in a place that’s less than perfect. In those imperfections lies the genius that moves us all forward. And it’s the privilege of leadership that unlocks it all. Because when your leader encourages you to believe in better and they believe it themselves, anything is possible."
