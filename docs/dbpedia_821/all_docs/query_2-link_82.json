In what ways is your club spreading the joys of hiking?\n\nTrail Work: What is your club doing to build, maintain, and promote hiking trails?\n\nInclusion: What efforts does your club make to include people of different age groups, foot trail user groups, backgrounds, abilities, racial groups and ethnicities?\n\nPhilanthropy: What charitable efforts does your club make within its community? What accomplishments has your club made to benefit the broader community?\n\nThe club application for this award should include:\n\nA statement that tells us what makes your club so awesome and why you should be the Club of the Year.\n\nA maximum of 2 documents that support your application. This could include anything from an informational one-sheet to a video.\n\nJust because your club is new or small, it doesn’t mean that it can’t leave a big footprint! Club of the Year submissions are judged on club achievements relative to the club’s size and age. A member club cannot win the award two years in a row. Please only enter one submission per member club!\n\nThe KTA Citation Award for Lifetime Achievement is presented to a person who has, over a period of years (not necessarily their entire lifetime), made significant contributions to the preservation of hiking trails and promoting hiking in Pennsylvania. Service may be in the form of volunteer efforts, publications, field work, or any other pursuit that has furthered the mission of the KTA. The nomination should include the name of the nominee, the approximate length of the person’s service to KTA's mission, and a brief description of the individual’s contributions.\n\nThe Thyra Sperry Volunteer of the Year Award goes to a KTA member whose recent service to KTA's mission, especially in the preceding year, is most worthy of recognition. It is named in honor of former KTA president Thyra Sperry (d. 2017) and her devoted service to KTA. The nomination should include the name of the nominee, the approximate length of the person’s service to KTA's mission, and a brief description of the individual’s contributions.\n\nCertificates of Achievement can also be awarded based on nominations from KTA member organizations for extraordinary work on projects that benefit hikers and/or trails in Pennsylvania. This award option allows clubs to nominate a volunteer who may not be an individual KTA member. The nomination should be based on recent service, especially in the past year, that serves the hiking public as a whole rather than primarily the members of the member club. The nomination should include the name of the nominee, the approximate length of the person’s service to KTA's mission, and a brief description of the individual’s contributions.\n\nSend all nominations to Barbara Wiemann, Awards Committee chair, at [email protected] by September 15, 2024.\n\nKeystone Trails Association Annual Hiking Awards ​\n\nThe KTA Hiking Awards honor individuals with a passion for exploring the wealth of incredible hiking trails that Pennsylvania has to offer.

Over the years, hundreds of individuals have demonstrated their dedication to hiking and, in no small part, to preservation of trails by applying for and receiving the various KTA awards.\n\nIn 2003, three additional awards joined the traditional Appalachian Trail, Merit, Merit II and Western Pennsylvania Awards. Hikers may now apply for the Pennsylvania Award, the Young Hiker Award, and the State Forest Trails Award (cosponsored by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation & Natural Resources)."
