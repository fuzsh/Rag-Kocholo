        "text": "Extract\n\nThe extract takes place in the palace market the day after Rowena and Berthilda have joined Thomas and Wulfstan’s team. They’re taking advantage of the fact the market sells the best horses in the country.\n\n‘Now,” he said, “I believe you’re a pretty good horsewoman too. Let’s go and choose our mounts.’\n\nBeing the palace marketplace with the King in residence, some of the finest horses in the country were there. They did an initial check of all three horse merchants to see just what was on offer, before they settled down to the selection process.\n\n‘We’ll start with one for you Hengist.’ said Wulfstan.\n\n‘But I already have a horse Your Highness.’ said Hengist.\n\n‘That’s true, but he’s your personal mount. I’m going to get you one specifically for our challenge. That way, if anything happens to it, you’ll still have your own. Now, go and choose one, and don’t worry about the money. You can get your own back on my father at this point!’ he laughed.\n\nHengist grinned, a little sheepishly, then picked out a beautiful piebald stallion that at 14 hands was one of the biggest in the country. He also seemed to have a mind of his own, but Hengist was confident he could handle him.\n\nRowena fell for an almost pure white gelding. The horse was beautifully muscled, yet gentle in nature. When she was astride it, with her glorious red hair and pale complexion, the effect was otherworldly.\n\nBerthilda chose a lovely roan gelding with three white feet. He wasn’t quite as good looking as the other two horses, but handsome enough and Berthilda sensed something in him. He in turn seemed to bond almost instantly with her.\n\nThat left Wulfstan, but at this precise moment he found himself outside the body again, watching Thomas.\n\n‘Bother! I could get really tired of this!’ he shouted. ‘Oh well, we both want the same one, so go get him Thomas.’\n\nFrom the moment they’d seen him, Thomas and Wulfstan’s hearts had settled on an almost pure black gelding. Its muscles rippled under the sheen of its coat as it stood proud and aloof, held by the merchant’s servant.\n\nThe boy was bored and began to play a game, tossing the end of the lead rope into the air and catching it in the same hand. The higher he tossed it, the less accurate he became, and eventually he got it wrong. The end knot landed heavily on the horse’s nose, causing it to flick its head in alarm. The boy took the blow full in the face and was sent flying. The merchant rushed up and prepared to strike the horse with his whip, but Thomas leapt between them and held up his hand to stop him.\n\n‘Your Highness!’ called Hengist. ‘You should stay back! He could flatten you!’\n\nThomas turned slowly to face the horse, who watched him warily. He held out his hands in front of him, open, showing he had nothing in them before taking a step slowly towards the animal. The horse stepped skittishly away, keeping the distance the same.\n\nThomas cocked his head to one side, dropped his shoulder, and snaked his head gently towards it.\n\nThe horse stood still, watching carefully.\n\nThen Thomas turned his body so he was parallel to the horse, and again cocked and snaked his head.\n\nThe horse remained still.\n\nAnother couple of rounds of this and Thomas was next to the horse. He held up the back of his hand, limp, so the horse could smell him. It began to nuzzle him gently, and in turn allowed Thomas to softly stroke its nose.\n\nWithin a minute it was calm enough for Thomas to nestle his forehead into its neck. The horse lowered its own head over Thomas’ shoulder, and closed its eyes in pleasure as the little human scratched it behind the ears.\n\n‘We’ll take him.’ said Thomas.\n\nThe others were watching him with astonishment. He shrugged his shoulders with an embarrassed smile. ‘I just behaved like a horse. I used my body like another horse would, and he understood I meant him no harm.’\n\n‘But where did you learn how to do that?’ asked the merchant. ‘It’s like magic!’\n\nThomas shook his head. ‘No. Not like magic. I’ve been watching horses for a long time, and learned how they behave, how they move. I thought that if I tried to speak their language, it might help, and it did. Berthilda does it too if you watch her. That’s why she’s so good with them. They trust her.’\n\n‘I do that?’ asked Berthilda.\n\n‘Sort of, only you’re much better than I am. For you it’s a natural thing. You’re just not aware you do it. But how many others can ride with no reins? Very few. The reason you can, is that they trust you, and you’re directing them with your legs. That’s all they need from you. It’s a gift, but it isn’t magic.’\n\nGuest Post\n\nAuthor Imogen Matthews’ Dutch background inspired her latest novel: Hidden in the Shadows\n\nAll my life I have heard stories from my Dutch mother about the war and the terrible Hunger Winter when she was forced to dig up tulip bulbs in frozen fields to save her family from starvation. She was a young woman of 19 when war broke out. Her stories were not entirely bleak – she described how she had many intensely exciting experiences, such as clambering over the rooftops with illegal leaflets to escape German soldiers who were searching for anyone working for the Resistance. It was these stories that sparked my imagination – what must it have been like for young people living through the thick of war?\n\nI still have close connections with Holland, visiting the beautiful Veluwe for family cycling holidays every year. I thought I knew the woods well, until a few years back I came across a memorial along one of the cycle paths. This large engraved stone told how the local community had helped build a village of underground huts for people needing to flee from the Nazis. They selflessly provided food, medicines and clothing to ensure their survival. It was a poignant reminder of what happened to millions of Jews during WW2 who weren’t so fortunate. I knew I had to get this story down, so I wrote The Hidden Village, a novel based on these real-life events, underpinned by my mother’s vivid stories.\n\nMy new novel, Hidden in the Shadows, is a sequel, but written as a standalone book. The opening scene is set just after the village was ambushed by the Germans, but with two characters who played a secondary role in the first book. I felt that it was time for Wouter and Laura’s stories to be heard: as they flee from danger, they lose one another, but must keep moving to avoid capture against all odds. As cold sweeps in signaling the start of the Hunger Winter, time is running out and Wouter’s search for his beloved Laura becomes a battle for survival.\n\nHidden in the Shadows and The Hidden Village are available as ebook and paperback on Amazon."
