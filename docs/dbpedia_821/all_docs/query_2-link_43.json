        "text": "The taxon authorship names have been adjusted to the format established by The International Plant Names Index (IPNI). This index is the most comprehensive database of plant names and authorship available today. It is managed through a collaboration between the Royal Botanic Gardens - Kew, The Harvard University Herbaria, and the Australian National Herbarium. A standardized authorship name is a surname, or an abbreviation of it (e.g. Ehrenb. for Ehrenberg). The rules for formatting names are rather flexible for the purpose of practicality, but the four absolute rules established by IPNI are:\n\nThe script must be in Roman characters.\n\nEvery standardized name must be unique to one person.\n\nIdentical surnames are given the same form (e.g. Smith is always Sm.). These authors are differentiated with additions such as suffixes or initials (e.g. W.Sm. for William Smith and H.L.Sm. for Hamilton Lanphere Smith).\n\nAll abbreviations and contractions are terminated with a full-stop (e.g. Hust. for Hustedt).\n\nThe database now has IPNI-formatted names for every taxonâ€™s species author, original author, synonym species author, and similar/comparison species author. This was done by searching for author names in the IPNI and cross-referencing author names in another database of taxon descriptions, such as the Catalogue of Diatom Names created by the California Academy of Sciences. Going forward, all new authorship citations should follow the IPNI format so that all citations are consistent and clear to understand. To make this easier, we have compiled a list of every author in our database along with their corresponding IPNI standardized name. This list is attached below. Please use this list when citing authors, or visit the IPNI directly."
