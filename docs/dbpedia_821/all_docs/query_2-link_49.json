        "text": "At Jukai, people who are receiving the precepts are given a lineage chart (kechimyaku) which shows their new dharma name at a long end of a blood line going back to the historical Buddha. Look closer and the line is actually a loop with no end and no beginning. One of the children attending our […]\n\nRead more…\n\nI often think of Zen books as something like the fourth treasure, combining with the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha treasures in a handy, go anywhere package. As a newbie to Zen practice, I’ve only scratched the surface of the countless titles available, but feel my practice has benefited immensely from what little I have read. […]\n\nRead more…\n\nThis for me is rebirth. I find it impossible to believe in reincarnation, literal interpretations of rebirth and versions of karma associated with these. I wrote this some months ago and found spending some time reflecting on the implications of this for my life and practice valuable, kickstarting another strand of practice. I’ll come […]\n\nRead more…\n\nI’ve found it quite difficult to think of a response to this question; how life and practice interplay isn’t something I spend time thinking about. It wasn’t until I sat down to write this that I realised that I don’t see daily life and practice life as clearly defined. In previous years I would have […]\n\nRead more…\n\nSix months before the pandemic, I attended a conference of the European Buddhist Union. It included a workshop about online dharma led by an American who worked with the youth network of Thich Nhat Hahn’s Plum Village sangha. I think he despaired at the lack of tech experience of our mostly middle-aged/older gathering of well-meaning […]\n\nRead more…\n\nI’m not sure I can explain well in words why I chose to receive jukai or tokudo because I don’t think I knew why I was doing it. I just felt that I would. There was a pull to do both that I didn’t understand but which felt important to honour. There was a jukai […]\n\nRead more…\n\nAs a fairly extreme addict of zazen and of shikantaza (“just sitting”) in particular, spending most of 2020 unable to sit up for more than a few minutes due to Long Covid meant that the mechanics of my practice needed to change. One option might have been to stop sitting but that somehow never occurred […]\n\nRead more…\n\nWhen I thought about the subject of sesshins past I was a little surprised that the memories of sesshin that came up weren’t of any particular sesshin or of the the long hours in the zendo, much as I honestly love the sitting. Instead what popped up were other accompanying moments. Wandering leisurely through the […]\n\nRead more…\n\nWhen I first pondered this question, the only word that appeared in my head was ‘life’. I tend to take a rather wide and inclusive approach to practice so before I jump to that conclusion it is perhaps more helpful to start with a more focused definition: Buddha as the historical figure whose example still […]\n\nRead more…"
