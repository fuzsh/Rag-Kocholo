        "text": "What happens when the corporation becomes an individual?\n\nLong tradition requires that every company jumps on new tech by putting it somewhere in their name.\n\nLast year we were all Web 3.0 companies. This year we’re all AI companies.\n\nSure, there will be some AI companies. But you’ll be able to count the important ones on the fingers of one hand.\n\nSo for the rest of us, what changes?\n\nEverything Changes\n\nThe short answer is, everything to do with branding and customer relationships.\n\nToday, customer relationships happen through websites, apps, emails, crappy bots and call centres with unusually high call volumes.\n\nBasically squinting at screens and poking at buttons.\n\nTomorrow, each customer will have a direct, personal relationship with the company itself. It’ll be just like the good old days — with added steroids.\n\nThe Branding Dream\n\nGenerative AI means tomorrow’s company is a helpful personality — one that exists independent of its staff and systems. The customer can talk to it anytime, anyhow, and just take up the conversation where they left off.\n\nFor example I will talk to my bank — I do mean literally the bank and not a representative of the bank — like this:\n\n“Hi, long time no speak. So I noticed £19.50 go out the last couple months, what is that?”\n\n“It’s been a while Jacoby, good to hear from you. Let me just check that withdrawal…”\n\n“Do you mean the £19.95 that went to Apple, Inc?”\n\n“Probably. Was that on the 15th?”\n\n“Varies between the 13th and 16th of each month for the last 11 months”.\n\n“Yes that’s it. What’s it actually for?”\n\n“It looks like a digital subscription to the AI Today podcast.”\n\n“I haven’t listened to that for months. Can you cancel it?”\n\n“Sure. Just say the word.”\n\n“Ok. Word.”\n\n“Funny! Well that’s cancelled going forward. Anything else I can help with?”\n\n“Thanks but no, speak later.”\n\nThe Corporation As Personality\n\nNobody enjoys using the web for things like banking, booking travel or grocery shopping.\n\nFor that sort of thing, websites on screens are approximations. They always fall slightly short.\n\nNever quite showing you what you need to see, never quite letting you do what you need to do.\n\nThese kinds of sites will wither away. Why fiddle about with a screen when you can talk directly to the corporate personality instead?\n\nThe context of that conversation is entirely personal, and always forms a relevant background to the next interaction.\n\nIdentifying the Customer\n\nTo maintain this seamless dialogue, the human and the corporate personality need to identify each other in both directions instantly and reliably.\n\nThat means you’ll use your own personal web agent, making conversations with multiple corporate personalities seamless, instantaneous and login-free through any device or medium.\n\nThink of it as a supercharged Alexa - only it belongs to you and communicates directly with any and all corporate personalities:\n\n“Sainsbury’s, are you there?”\n\n“Hi Jacoby, yes I’m here.”\n\n“Can you do me the usual weekly grocery shop, only no cauliflower this time?”\n\n“Yes of course. Delivery should be Monday 6pm to your usual address, is that ok?”\n\n“Thanks, that’s great. Bye.”\n\nSeamless is Inevitable\n\nNo website. No login. No tedious repetition to bring a new representative up to speed (“Sorry but you’re the third person I’ve spoken to about this…”).\n\nJust seamless service arising from the secure, direct interaction of personal agent and corporate personality.\n\nSecrets and Lies\n\nThe organisations that lead this service revolution will set a standard that all others will be forced to follow.\n\nBut now ask yourself — who owns the conversations you have with all these corporate personalities that are your bank, your online stores, your governmental agencies?\n\nStudy History? Or Repeat it?\n\nFor 30 years of the web revolution, tech companies enthusiastically and successfully stole our data. They tricked legislators with phrases like “platform, not publisher”. They keep our data to themselves and use it to make a lot of money.\n\nThis drives social division and inequality in myriad ways.\n\nDuring the revolution of the last 30 years, we might as well have all been asleep.\n\nIf we fall into the Alexa trap (or Hey Google, or Hey Siri) we’re once again asleep on the job.\n\nWe and our legislators should stay awake for this coming revolution. Because the consequences of sleeping through this one will not be pretty."
