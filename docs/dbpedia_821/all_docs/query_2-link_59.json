        "meta_description": "Abstract. The Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf buttresses a significant portion of Thwaites Glacier through contact with a pinning point 40âkm offshore of the present grounding line. Predicting future rates of Thwaites Glacierâs contribution to sea-level rise depends on the evolution of this pinning point and the resultant change in the ice-shelf stress field since the breakup of the Thwaites Western Glacier Tongue in 2009. Here we use Landsat-8 feature tracking of ice velocity in combination with ice-sheet model perturbation experiments to show how past changes in flow velocity have been governed in large part by changes in lateral shear and pinning point interactions with the Thwaites Western Glacier Tongue. We then use recent satellite altimetry data from ICESat-2 to show that Thwaites Glacierâs grounding line has continued to retreat rapidly; in particular, the grounded area of the pinning point is greatly reduced from earlier mappings in 2014, and grounded ice elevations are continuing to decrease. This loss has created two pinned areas with ice flow now funneled between them. If current rates of surface lowering persist, the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf will unpin from the seafloor in less than a decade, despite our finding from airborne radar data that the seafloor underneath the pinning point is about 200âm shallower than previously reported. Advection of relatively thin and mechanically damaged ice onto the remaining portions of the pinning point and feedback mechanisms involving basal melting may further accelerate the unpinning. As a result, ice discharge will likely increase up to 10â% along a 45âkm stretch of the grounding line that is currently buttressed by the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf.",

TG holds the single greatest control on sea-level rise over the next few centuries, so it is important to understand changes on the TEIS, which controls much of TG's flow into the ocean. Our results suggest that the TEIS is progressively destabilizing and is likely to disintegrate over the next few decades.\n\nDifferential interferometric synthetic aperture radar for tide modelling in Antarctic ice-shelf grounding zones\n\nChristian T. Wild, Oliver J. Marsh, and Wolfgang Rack\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 3171–3191, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Antarctica, ocean tides control the motion of ice sheets near the coastline as well as melt rates underneath the floating ice. By combining the spatial advantage of rare but highly accurate satellite images with the temporal advantage of tide-prediction models, vertical displacement of floating ice due to ocean tides can now be predicted accurately. This allows the detailed study of ice-flow dynamics in areas that matter the most to the stability of Antarctica's ice sheets.\n\nThe Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) v1.1\n\nFabien Maussion, Anton Butenko, Nicolas Champollion, Matthias Dusch, Julia Eis, KÃ©vin Fourteau, Philipp Gregor, Alexander H. Jarosch, Johannes Landmann, Felix Oesterle, Beatriz Recinos, Timo Rothenpieler, Anouk Vlug, Christian T. Wild, and Ben Marzeion\n\nGeosci.

Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM; www.oggm.org), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world.\n\nAnalysis of ice shelf flexure and its InSAR representation in the grounding zone of the southern McMurdo Ice Shelf\n\nWolfgang Rack, Matt A. King, Oliver J. Marsh, Christian T. Wild, and Dana Floricioiu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 2481–2490, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2481-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2481-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPredicting changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet involves fully understanding ice dynamics at the transition between grounded and floating ice. We map tidal bending of ice by satellite using InSAR, and we use precise GPS measurements with assumptions of tidal elastic bending to better interpret the satellite signal. It allows us to better define the grounding-line position and to refine the shape of tidal flexure profiles.\n\nThe demise of the world's largest piedmont glacier: a probabilistic forecast\n\nDouglas Brinkerhoff, Brandon Tober, Michael Daniel, Victor Devaux-Chupin, Michael Christoffersen, John W. Holt, Christopher F. Larsen, Mark Fahnestock, Michael G. Loso, Kristin M. F. Timm, Russell Mitchell, and Martin Truffer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2354,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2354, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSít' Tlein is one of the largest glaciers in the world outside of the polar regions, and we know that it has been rapidly thinning. To forecast how this glacier will change in the future, we combine a computer model of ice flow with measurements from many different sources. Our model tells us that with high probability, Sít' Tlein's lower reaches are going to disappear in the next century and a half, creating a new bay or lake along Alaska's coastline.\n\nTidal influence on flow dynamics of Dotson Ice Shelf, West Antarctica\n\nGabriela Collao-Barrios, Ted A. Scambos, Christian T. Wild, Martin Truffer, Karen E. Alley, and Erin C. Pettit\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1895,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1895, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDestabilization of ice shelves frequently leads to significant acceleration and greater mass loss, affecting rates of sea level rise. Our results show a relation between tides, flow direction, and grounding-zone acceleration that result from changing stresses in the ice margins and around a nunatak in Dotson Ice Shelf. The study describes a new way tides can influence ice shelf dynamics, an effect that could become more common as ice shelves thin and weaken around Antarctica.\n\nTriggers of the 2022 Larsen B multi-year landfast sea ice breakout and initial glacier response\n\nNaomi E. Ochwat, Ted A. Scambos, Alison F. Banwell, Robert S. Anderson, Michelle L. Maclennan, Ghislain Picard, Julia A. Shates, Sebastian Marinsek, Liliana Margonari, Martin Truffer, and Erin C. Pettit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1709–1731, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1709-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1709-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula, there is a small bay that had sea ice fastened to the shoreline (fast ice) for over a decade. The fast ice stabilized the glaciers that fed into the ocean. In January 2022, the fast ice broke away. Using satellite data we found that this was because of low sea ice concentrations and a high long-period ocean wave swell. We find that the glaciers have responded to this event by thinning, speeding up, and retreating by breaking off lots of icebergs at remarkable rates.\n\nMillennial and orbital-scale variability in a 54 000-year record of total air content from the South Pole ice core\n\nJenna A. Epifanio, Edward J. Brook, Christo Buizert, Erin C. Pettit, Jon S. Edwards, John M. Fegyveresi, Todd A. Sowers, Jeffrey P. Severinghaus, and Emma C. Kahle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4837–4851, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total air content (TAC) of polar ice cores has long been considered a potential proxy for past ice sheet elevation. This study presents a high-resolution record of TAC from the South Pole ice core. The record reveals orbital- and millennial-scale variability that cannot be explained by elevation changes. The orbital- and millennial-scale changes are likely a product of firn grain metamorphism near the surface of the ice sheet, due to summer insolation changes or local accumulation changes.\n\nModeling saline fluid flow through subglacial ice-walled channels and the impact of density on fluid flux\n\nAmy Jenson, Mark Skidmore, Lucas Beem, Martin Truffer, and Scott McCalla\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-792,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-792, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater in some glacier environments contains salt which increases the density of the fluid and decreases the freezing point of the fluid. As a result, hypersaline lakes can exist in places where freshwater cannot and can contain unique microbiological communities. We model the flow of saline fluid from a subglacial lake through a channel at the glacier bed. The results suggest that fluid with higher salinity reach higher discharge rates compared to fresh water due to increased fluid density.\n\nMass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 1992 to 2020\n\nInÃ¨s N.

Sutterley, Bramha Dutt Vishwakarma, Jan Melchior van Wessem, David Wiese, Wouter van der Wal, and Bert Wouters\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 1597–1616, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1597-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy measuring changes in the volume, gravitational attraction, and ice flow of Greenland and Antarctica from space, we can monitor their mass gain and loss over time. Here, we present a new record of the Earthâs polar ice sheet mass balance produced by aggregating 50 satellite-based estimates of ice sheet mass change. This new assessment shows that the ice sheets have lost (7.5 x 1012) t of ice between 1992 and 2020, contributing 21 mm to sea level rise.\n\nClimatology and surface impacts of atmospheric rivers on West Antarctica\n\nMichelle L. Maclennan, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Christine A. Shields, Andrew O. Hoffman, Nander Wever, Megan Thompson-Munson, Andrew C. Winters, Erin C. Pettit, Theodore A. Scambos, and Jonathan D. Wille\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 865–881, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-865-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-865-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric rivers are air masses that transport large amounts of moisture and heat towards the poles. Here, we use a combination of weather observations and models to quantify the amount of snowfall caused by atmospheric rivers in West Antarctica which is about 10 % of the total snowfall each year. We then examine a unique event that occurred in early February 2020, when three atmospheric rivers made landfall over West Antarctica in rapid succession, leading to heavy snowfall and surface melt.\n\nSub-seasonal variability of supraglacial ice cliff melt rates and associated processes from time-lapse photogrammetry\n\nMarin Kneib, Evan S. Miles, Pascal Buri, Stefan Fugger, Michael McCarthy, Thomas E. Shaw, Zhao Chuanxi, Martin Truffer, Matthew J. Westoby, Wei Yang, and Francesca Pellicciotti\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4701–4725, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4701-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4701-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce cliffs are believed to be important contributors to the melt of debris-covered glaciers, but this has rarely been quantified as the cliffs can disappear or rapidly expand within a few weeks. We used photogrammetry techniques to quantify the weekly evolution and melt of four cliffs. We found that their behaviour and melt during the monsoon is strongly controlled by supraglacial debris, streams and ponds, thus providing valuable insights on the melt and evolution of debris-covered glaciers.\n\nRapid fragmentation of Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf\n\nDouglas I. Benn, Adrian Luckman, Jan A. Ã strÃ¶m, Anna J. Crawford, Stephen L. Cornford, Suzanne L. Bevan, Thomas Zwinger, Rupert Gladstone, Karen Alley, Erin Pettit, and Jeremy Bassis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2545–2564, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2545-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2545-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThwaites Glacier (TG), in West Antarctica, is potentially unstable and may contribute significantly to sea-level rise as global warming continues. Using satellite data, we show that Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf, the largest remaining floating extension of TG, has started to accelerate as it fragments along a shear zone. Computer modelling does not indicate that fragmentation will lead to imminent glacier collapse, but it is clear that major, rapid, and unpredictable changes are underway.\n\nBrief communication: A roadmap towards credible projections of ice sheet contribution to sea level\n\nAndy Aschwanden, Timothy C. Bartholomaus, Douglas J. Brinkerhoff, and Martin Truffer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5705–5715, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5705-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5705-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimating how much ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica will contribute to sea level rise is of critical societal importance. However, our analysis shows that recent efforts are not trustworthy because the models fail at reproducing contemporary ice melt. Here we present a roadmap towards making more credible estimates of ice sheet melt.\n\nTwo decades of dynamic change and progressive destabilization on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf\n\nKaren E. Alley, Christian T. Wild, Adrian Luckman, Ted A. Scambos, Martin Truffer, Erin C. Pettit, Atsuhiro Muto, Bruce Wallin, Marin Klinger, Tyler Sutterley, Sarah F. Child, Cyrus Hulen, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Michelle Maclennan, Eric Keenan, and Devon Dunmire\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5187–5203, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 20-year, satellite-based record of velocity and thickness change on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS), the largest remaining floating extension of Thwaites Glacier (TG). TG holds the single greatest control on sea-level rise over the next few centuries, so it is important to understand changes on the TEIS, which controls much of TG's flow into the ocean. Our results suggest that the TEIS is progressively destabilizing and is likely to disintegrate over the next few decades.\n\nGeophysical constraints on the properties of a subglacial lake in northwest Greenland\n\nRoss Maguire, Nicholas Schmerr, Erin Pettit, Kiya Riverman, Christyna Gardner, Daniella N. DellaGiustina, Brad Avenson, Natalie Wagner, Angela G. Marusiak, Namrah Habib, Juliette I. Broadbeck, Veronica J. Bray, and Samuel H. Bailey\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3279–3291, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3279-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3279-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the last decade, airborne radar surveys have revealed the presence of lakes below the Greenland ice sheet. However, little is known about their properties, including their depth and the volume of water they store. We performed a ground-based geophysics survey in northwestern Greenland and, for the first time, were able to image the depth of a subglacial lake and estimate its volume. Our findings have implications for the thermal state and stability of the ice sheet in northwest Greenland.\n\nGrounding zone subglacial properties from calibrated active-source seismic methods\n\nHuw J. Horgan, Laurine van Haastrecht, Richard B. Alley, Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Lucas H. Beem, Knut Christianson, Atsuhiro Muto, and Matthew R. Siegfried\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1863–1880, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1863-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1863-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe grounding zone marks the transition from a grounded ice sheet to a floating ice shelf. Like Earth's coastlines, the grounding zone is home to interactions between the ocean, fresh water, and geology but also has added complexity and importance due to the overriding ice. Here we use seismic surveying – sending sound waves down through the ice – to image the grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica and learn more about the nature of this important transition zone.\n\nUnderstanding drivers of glacier-length variability over the last millennium\n\nAlan Huston, Nicholas Siler, Gerard H. Roe, Erin Pettit, and Nathan J. Steiger\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1645–1662, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1645-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1645-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the past 1000 years of glacier length variability using a simple glacier model and an ensemble of global climate model simulations. Glaciers with long response times are more likely to record global climate changes caused by events like volcanic eruptions and greenhouse gas emissions, while glaciers with short response times are more likely to record natural variability. This difference stems from differences in the frequency spectra of natural and forced temperature variability.\n\nSpectral characterization, radiative forcing and pigment content of coastal Antarctic snow algae: approaches to spectrally discriminate red and green communities and their impact on snowmelt\n\nAlia L. Khan, Heidi M. Dierssen, Ted A. Scambos, Juan HÃ¶fer, and Raul R. Cordero\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 133–148, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-133-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-133-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present radiative forcing (RF) estimates by snow algae in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region from multi-year measurements of solar radiation and ground-based hyperspectral characterization of red and green snow algae collected during a brief field expedition in austral summer 2018. Mean daily RF was double for green (~26 W m−2) vs. red (~13 W m−2) snow algae during the peak growing season, which is on par with midlatitude dust attributions capable of advancing snowmelt.\n\nNew gravity-derived bathymetry for the Thwaites, Crosson, and Dotson ice shelves revealing two ice shelf populations\n\nTom A. Jordan, David Porter, Kirsty Tinto, Romain Millan, Atsuhiro Muto, Kelly Hogan, Robert D. Larter, Alastair G. C. Graham, and John D. Paden\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2869–2882, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2869-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLinking ocean and ice sheet processes allows prediction of sea level change. Ice shelves form a floating buffer between the ice–ocean systems, but the water depth beneath is often a mystery, leaving a critical blind spot in our understanding of how these systems interact. Here, we use airborne measurements of gravity to reveal the bathymetry under the ice shelves flanking the rapidly changing Thwaites Glacier and adjacent glacier systems, providing new insights and data for future models.\n\nBrief communication: Mapping Greenland's perennial firn aquifers using enhanced-resolution L-band brightness temperature image time series\n\nJulie Z. Miller, David G. Long, Kenneth C. Jezek, Joel T. Johnson, Mary J. Brodzik, Christopher A. Shuman, Lora S. Koenig, and Ted A.

Wild, Oliver J. Marsh, and Wolfgang Rack\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 3171–3191, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Antarctica, ocean tides control the motion of ice sheets near the coastline as well as melt rates underneath the floating ice. By combining the spatial advantage of rare but highly accurate satellite images with the temporal advantage of tide-prediction models, vertical displacement of floating ice due to ocean tides can now be predicted accurately. This allows the detailed study of ice-flow dynamics in areas that matter the most to the stability of Antarctica's ice sheets.\n\nIceberg topography and volume classification using TanDEM-X interferometry\n\nDyre O. Dammann, Leif E. B. Eriksson, Son V. Nghiem, Erin C. Pettit, Nathan T. Kurtz, John G. Sonntag, Thomas E. Busche, Franz J. Meyer, and Andrew R. Mahoney\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1861–1875, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1861-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1861-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe validate TanDEM-X interferometry as a tool for deriving iceberg subaerial morphology using Operation IceBridge data. This approach enables a volumetric classification of icebergs, according to volume relevant to iceberg drift and decay, freshwater contribution, and potential impact on structures. We find iceberg volumes to generally match within 7 %. These results suggest that TanDEM-X could pave the way for future interferometric systems of scientific and operational iceberg classification.\n\nThe Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) v1.1\n\nFabien Maussion, Anton Butenko, Nicolas Champollion, Matthias Dusch, Julia Eis, KÃ©vin Fourteau, Philipp Gregor, Alexander H.

Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM; www.oggm.org), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world.\n\nExtracting recent short-term glacier velocity evolution over southern Alaska and the Yukon from a large collection of Landsat data\n\nBas Altena, Ted Scambos, Mark Fahnestock, and Andreas KÃ¤Ã¤b\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 795–814, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-795-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-795-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany glaciers in southern Alaska and the Yukon experience changes in flow speed, which occur in episodes or sporadically. These flow changes can be measured with satellites, but the resulting raw velocity products are messy. Thus in this study we developed an automatic method to produce a synthesized velocity product over a large glacier region of roughly 600 km by 200 km. Velocities are at a monthly resolution and at 300 m resolution, making all kinds of glacier dynamics observable.\n\nIncreased West Antarctic and unchanged East Antarctic ice discharge over the last 7 years\n\nAlex S. Gardner, Geir Moholdt, Ted Scambos, Mark Fahnstock, Stefan Ligtenberg, Michiel van den Broeke, and Johan Nilsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 521–547, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-521-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe map present-day Antarctic surface velocities from Landsat imagery and compare to earlier estimates from radar. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 89â¯% of the observed increase in ice discharge. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic have been remarkably stable. Our work suggests that patterns of mass loss are part of a longer-term phase of enhanced flow.\n\nSurface formation, preservation, and history of low-porosity crusts at the WAIS Divide site, West Antarctica\n\nJohn M. Fegyveresi, Richard B. Alley, Atsuhiro Muto, AnaÃ¯s J. Orsi, and Matthew K. Spencer\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 325–341, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-325-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-325-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObservations at the WAIS Divide site in West Antarctica show that near-surface snow is strongly altered by weather-related processes, such as strong winds and temperature fluctuations, producing features that are recognizable within the WDC06A ice core. Specifically, over 10 000 prominent crusts were observed in the upper 560 m of the core. We show that these crusts develop more often in summers, during relatively low-wind, low-humidity, clear-sky periods with intense daytime sunshine.\n\nAnalysis of ice shelf flexure and its InSAR representation in the grounding zone of the southern McMurdo Ice Shelf\n\nWolfgang Rack, Matt A.

We map tidal bending of ice by satellite using InSAR, and we use precise GPS measurements with assumptions of tidal elastic bending to better interpret the satellite signal. It allows us to better define the grounding-line position and to refine the shape of tidal flexure profiles.\n\nActive subglacial lakes and channelized water flow beneath the Kamb Ice Stream\n\nByeong-Hoon Kim, Choon-Ki Lee, Ki-Weon Seo, Won Sang Lee, and Ted Scambos\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2971–2980, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2971-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2971-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKamb Ice Stream (KIS) in Antarctica ceased rapid ice flow approximately 160 years ago, still influencing on the current mass balance of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We identify two previously unknown subglacial lakes beneath the stagnated trunk of the KIS. Rapid fill-drain hydrologic events over several months indicate that the lakes are probably connected by a subglacial drainage network. Our findings support previously published conceptual models of the KIS shutdown.\n\nIn situ field measurements of the temporal evolution of low-frequency sea-ice dielectric properties in relation to temperature, salinity, and microstructure\n\nMegan O'Sadnick, Malcolm Ingham, Hajo Eicken, and Erin Pettit\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 2923–2940, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2923-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-2923-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNon-destructive in situ monitoring of sea-ice microstructure is of value to sea-ice research and operations but remains elusive to date. We relate in situ measurements of sea-ice dielectric properties at frequencies of 10 to 95 Hz to ice temperature, salinity, and microstructure. Results support the possible use of low-frequency electric measurements to monitor the seasonal evolution of brine volume fraction, pore volume, and connectivity of pore space in sea ice.\n\nThe modelled surface mass balance of the Antarctic Peninsula at 5.5â¯km horizontal resolution\n\nJ.

Precipitation (snowfall and rain) largely determines the SMB, and is exceptionally high over the western mountain slopes, with annual values > 4 m water equivalent. Snowmelt is widespread over the AP, but only runs off into the ocean at some locations: the Larsen B,C, and Wilkins ice shelves, and along the north-western mountains.\n\nEstimating supraglacial lake depth in West Greenland using Landsat 8 and comparison with other multispectral methods\n\nA. Pope, T. A. Scambos, M. Moussavi, M. Tedesco, M. Willis, D. Shean, and S. Grigsby\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 15–27, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-15-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-15-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLiquid water stored on the surface of ice sheets and glaciers, such as that in surface (supraglacial) lakes, plays a key role in the glacial hydrological system. Multispectral remote sensing can be used to detect lakes and estimate their depth. Here, we use in situ data to assess lake depth retrieval using the recently launched Landsat 8. We validate Landsat 8-derived depths and provide suggestions for future applications. We apply our method to a case study are in Greenland for summer 2014.\n\nConfiguration of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet at LGM based on a new synthesis of seabed imagery\n\nC. Lavoie, E.

The satellite data is laser altimetry from ICESat and stereo image DEM differences. The results show that 24..9 Â± 7.8 billion tons of ice are lost from the region north of 66Â°S on the peninsula each year. The majority of the data cover 2003-2008.\n\nKinetic fractionation of gases by deep air convection in polar firn\n\nK. Kawamura, J. P. Severinghaus, M. R. Albert, Z. R. Courville, M. A.

Bracegirdle, Ella Gilbert, Peter L. Langen, Matthew A. Lazzara, Ruth Mottram, Tony Phillips, Ruth Price, Sebastian B. Simonsen, and Stuart Webster\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2897–2916, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2897-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2897-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated a melt event over the Ross Ice Shelf. We use regional climate models and a firn model to simulate the melt and compare the results with satellite data. We find that the firn model aligned well with observed melt days in certain parts of the ice shelf. The firn model had challenges accurately simulating the melt extent in the western sector. We identified potential reasons for these discrepancies, pointing to limitations in the models related to representing the cloud properties.\n\nCoupled iceâocean interactions during future retreat of West Antarctic ice streams in the Amundsen Sea sector\n\nDavid T. Bett, Alexander T. Bradley, C. Rosie Williams, Paul R. Holland, Robert J. Arthern, and Daniel N. Goldberg\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2653–2675, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2653-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2653-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new ice–ocean model simulates future ice sheet evolution in the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica. Substantial ice retreat is simulated in all scenarios, with some retreat still occurring even with no future ocean melting. The future of small \"pinning points\" (islands of ice that contact the seabed) is an important control on this retreat. Ocean melting is crucial in causing these features to go afloat, providing the link by which climate change may affect this sector's sea level contribution.\n\nResponses of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers to melt and sliding parameterizations\n\nIan Joughin, Daniel Shapero, and Pierre Dutrieux\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2583–2601, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2583-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2583-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are losing ice to the ocean rapidly as warmer water melts their floating ice shelves. Models help determine how much such glaciers will contribute to sea level. We find that ice loss varies in response to how much melting the ice shelves are subjected to. Our estimated losses are also sensitive to how much the friction beneath the glaciers is reduced as it goes afloat. Melt-forced sea level rise from these glaciers is likely to be less than 10 cm by 2300.\n\nExtreme melting at Greenland's largest floating ice tongue\n\nOle Zeising, Niklas Neckel, Nils DÃ¶rr, Veit Helm, Daniel Steinhage, Ralph Timmermann, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1333–1357, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1333-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1333-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 79° North Glacier in Greenland has experienced significant changes over the last decades. Due to extreme melt rates, the ice has thinned significantly in the vicinity of the grounding line, where a large subglacial channel has formed since 2010. We attribute these changes to warm ocean currents and increased subglacial discharge from surface melt. However, basal melting has decreased since 2018, indicating colder water inflow into the cavity below the glacier.\n\nThe complex basal morphology and ice dynamics of the Nansen Ice Shelf, East Antarctica\n\nChristine F. Dow, Derek Mueller, Peter Wray, Drew Friedrichs, Alexander L. Forrest, Jasmin B. McInerney, Jamin Greenbaum, Donald D. Blankenship, Choon Ki Lee, and Won Sang Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1105–1123, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1105-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1105-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves are a key control on Antarctic contribution to sea level rise. We examine the Nansen Ice Shelf in East Antarctica using a combination of field-based and satellite data. We find the basal topography of the ice shelf is highly variable, only partially visible in satellite datasets. We also find that the thinnest region of the ice shelf is altered over time by ice flow rates and ocean melting. These processes can cause fractures to form that eventually result in large calving events.\n\nUnveiling spatial variability within the Dotson Melt Channel through high-resolution basal melt rates from the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica\n\nAnn-Sofie Priergaard Zinck, Bert Wouters, Erwin Lambert, and Stef Lhermitte\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 3785–3801, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3785-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-3785-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ice shelves in Antarctica are melting from below, which puts their stability at risk. Therefore, it is important to observe how much and where they are melting. In this study we use high-resolution satellite imagery to derive 50 m resolution basal melt rates of the Dotson Ice Shelf. With the high resolution of our product we are able to uncover small-scale features which may in the future help us to understand the state and fate of the Antarctic ice shelves and their (in)stability.\n\nBrief communication: Is vertical shear in an ice shelf (still) negligible?\n\nChris Miele, Timothy C. Bartholomaus, and Ellyn M. Enderlin\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2701–2704, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2701-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2701-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVertical shear stress (the stress orientation usually associated with vertical gradients in horizontal velocities) is a key component of the stress balance of ice shelves. However, partly due to historical assumptions, vertical shear is often misspoken of today as negligible in ice shelf models. We address this miscommunication, providing conceptual guidance regarding this often misrepresented stress. Fundamentally, vertical shear is required to balance thickness gradients in ice shelves.\n\nAn analysis of the interaction between surface and basal crevasses in ice shelves\n\nMaryam Zarrinderakht, Christian Schoof, and Anthony Peirce\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1252,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1252, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective of the study is to understand the interactions between surface and basal crevasses by conducting a stability analysis and addressing the implications of the findings for potential calving laws. The study's findings indicate that while the propagation of one crack in the case of two aligned surface and basal crevasses does not significantly reinforce the propagation of the other, the presence of multiple crevasses on one side enhances stability and decreases crack propagation.\n\nChange in Antarctic ice shelf area from 2009 to 2019\n\nJulia R. Andreasen, Anna E. Hogg, and Heather L. Selley\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 2059–2072, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2059-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-2059-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere are few long-term, high spatial resolution observations of ice shelf change in Antarctica over the past 3 decades. In this study, we use high spatial resolution observations to map the annual calving front location on 34 ice shelves around Antarctica from 2009 to 2019 using satellite data. The results provide a comprehensive assessment of ice front migration across Antarctica over the last decade.\n\nPredicting ocean-induced ice-shelf melt rates using deep learning\n\nSebastian H. R. Rosier, Christopher Y. S. Bull, Wai L. Woo, and G. Hilmar Gudmundsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 499–518, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-499-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-499-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFuture ice loss from Antarctica could raise sea levels by several metres, and key to this is the rate at which the ocean melts the ice sheet from below. Existing methods for modelling this process are either computationally expensive or very simplified. We present a new approach using machine learning to mimic the melt rates calculated by an ocean model but in a fraction of the time. This approach may provide a powerful alternative to existing methods, without compromising on accuracy or speed.\n\nGlaciological history and structural evolution of the Shackleton Ice Shelf system, East Antarctica, over the past 60 years\n\nSarah S. Thompson, Bernd Kulessa, Adrian Luckman, Jacqueline A. Halpin, Jamin S. Greenbaum, Tyler Pelle, Feras Habbal, Jingxue Guo, Lenneke M. Jong, Jason L. Roberts, Bo Sun, and Donald D. Blankenship\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 157–174, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-157-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-157-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use satellite imagery and ice penetrating radar to investigate the stability of the Shackleton system in East Antarctica. We find significant changes in surface structures across the system and observe a significant increase in ice flow speed (up to 50 %) on the floating part of Scott Glacier. We conclude that knowledge remains woefully insufficient to explain recent observed changes in the grounded and floating regions of the system.\n\nAn assessment of basal melt parameterisations for Antarctic ice shelves\n\nClara Burgard, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Ronja Reese, Adrian Jenkins, and Pierre Mathiot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4931–4975, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4931-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4931-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe ocean-induced melt at the base of the floating ice shelves around Antarctica is one of the largest uncertainty factors in the Antarctic contribution to future sea-level rise. We assess the performance of several existing parameterisations in simulating basal melt rates on a circum-Antarctic scale, using an ocean simulation resolving the cavities below the shelves as our reference. We find that the simple quadratic slope-independent and plume parameterisations yield the best compromise.\n\nSurface melt on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, East Antarctica (2003â2021)\n\nDominic Saunderson, Andrew Mackintosh, Felicity McCormack, Richard Selwyn Jones, and Ghislain Picard\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4553–4569, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4553-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4553-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the variability in surface melt on the Shackleton Ice Shelf in East Antarctica over the last 2 decades (2003–2021). Using daily satellite observations and the machine learning approach of a self-organising map, we identify nine distinct spatial patterns of melt. These patterns allow comparisons of melt within and across melt seasons and highlight the importance of both air temperatures and local controls such as topography, katabatic winds, and albedo in driving surface melt.\n\nThe effect of hydrology and crevasse wall contact on calving\n\nMaryam Zarrinderakht, Christian Schoof, and Anthony Peirce\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4491–4512, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4491-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4491-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIceberg calving is the reason for more than half of mass loss in both Greenland and Antarctica and indirectly contributes to sea-level rise. Our study models iceberg calving by linear elastic fracture mechanics and uses a boundary element method to compute crack tip propagation. This model handles the contact condition: preventing crack faces from penetrating into each other and enabling the derivation of calving laws for different forms of hydrological forcing.\n\nOn the evolution of an ice shelf melt channel at the base of Filchner Ice Shelf, from observations and viscoelastic modeling\n\nAngelika Humbert, Julia Christmann, Hugh F. J. Corr, Veit Helm, Lea-Sophie HÃ¶yns, Coen Hofstede, Ralf MÃ¼ller, Niklas Neckel, Keith W. Nicholls, Timm Schultz, Daniel Steinhage, Michael Wolovick, and Ole Zeising\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4107–4139, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4107-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4107-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves are normally flat structures that fringe the Antarctic continent. At some locations they have channels incised into their underside. On Filchner Ice Shelf, such a channel is more than 50 km long and up to 330 m high. We conducted field measurements of basal melt rates and found a maximum of 2 m yr−1. Simulations represent the geometry evolution of the channel reasonably well. There is no reason to assume that this type of melt channel is destabilizing ice shelves.\n\nOngoing grounding line retreat and fracturing initiated at the Petermann Glacier ice shelf, Greenland, after 2016\n\nRomain Millan, Jeremie Mouginot, Anna Derkacheva, Eric Rignot, Pietro Milillo, Enrico Ciraci, Luigi Dini, and Anders BjÃ¸rk\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3021–3031, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3021-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3021-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe detect for the first time a dramatic retreat of the grounding line of Petermann Glacier, a major glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using satellite data, we also observe a speedup of the glacier and a fracturing of the ice shelf. This sequence of events is coherent with ocean warming in this region and suggests that Petermann Glacier has initiated a phase of destabilization, which is of prime importance for the stability and future contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise.\n\nShear-margin melting causes stronger transient ice discharge than ice-stream melting in idealized simulations\n\nJohannes Feldmann, Ronja Reese, Ricarda Winkelmann, and Anders Levermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1927–1940, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1927-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1927-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a numerical model to simulate the flow of a simplified, buttressed Antarctic-type outlet glacier with an attached ice shelf. We find that after a few years of perturbation such a glacier responds much stronger to melting under the ice-shelf shear margins than to melting in the central fast streaming part of the ice shelf. This study explains the underlying physical mechanism which might gain importance in the future if melt rates under the Antarctic ice shelves continue to increase.\n\nBasal melt of the southern Filchner Ice Shelf, Antarctica\n\nOle Zeising, Daniel Steinhage, Keith W. Nicholls, Hugh F. J. Corr, Craig L. Stewart, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1469–1482, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1469-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1469-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote-sensing-derived basal melt rates of ice shelves are of great importance due to their capability to cover larger areas. We performed in situ measurements with a phase-sensitive radar on the southern Filchner Ice Shelf, showing moderate melt rates and low small-scale spatial variability. The comparison with remote-sensing-based melt rates revealed large differences caused by the estimation of vertical strain rates from remote sensing velocity fields that modern fields can overcome.\n\nAutomatic delineation of cracks with Sentinel-1 interferometry for monitoring ice shelf damage and calving\n\nLudivine Libert, Jan Wuite, and Thomas Nagler\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1523–1542, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1523-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1523-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOpen fractures are important to monitor because they weaken the ice shelf structure. We propose a novel approach using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry for automatic delineation of ice shelf cracks. The method is applied to Sentinel-1 images of Brunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica, and the propagation of the North Rift, which led to iceberg calving in February 2021, is traced. It is also shown that SAR interferometry is more sensitive to rifting than SAR backscatter and optical imagery.\n\nIce-shelf ocean boundary layer dynamics from large-eddy simulations\n\nCarolyn Branecky Begeman, Xylar Asay-Davis, and Luke Van Roekel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 277–295, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-277-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-277-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses ocean modeling at ultra-high resolution to study the small-scale ocean mixing that controls ice-shelf melting. It offers some insights into the relationship between ice-shelf melting and ocean temperature far from the ice base, which may help us project how fast ice will melt when ocean waters entering the cavity warm. This study adds to a growing body of research that indicates we need a more sophisticated treatment of ice-shelf melting in coarse-resolution ocean models.\n\nThe potential of synthetic aperture radar interferometry for assessing meltwater lake dynamics on Antarctic ice shelves\n\nWeiran Li, Stef Lhermitte, and Paco LÃ³pez-Dekker\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5309–5322, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5309-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5309-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface meltwater lakes have been observed on several Antarctic ice shelves in field studies and optical images. Meltwater lakes can drain and refreeze, increasing the fragility of the ice shelves. The combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and interferometric information (InSAR) can provide the cryosphere community with the possibility to continuously assess the dynamics of the meltwater lakes, potentially helping to facilitate the study of ice shelves in a changing climate.\n\nTwo decades of dynamic change and progressive destabilization on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf\n\nKaren E. Alley, Christian T. Wild, Adrian Luckman, Ted A. Scambos, Martin Truffer, Erin C. Pettit, Atsuhiro Muto, Bruce Wallin, Marin Klinger, Tyler Sutterley, Sarah F. Child, Cyrus Hulen, Jan T. M. Lenaerts, Michelle Maclennan, Eric Keenan, and Devon Dunmire\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 5187–5203, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-5187-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a 20-year, satellite-based record of velocity and thickness change on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS), the largest remaining floating extension of Thwaites Glacier (TG). TG holds the single greatest control on sea-level rise over the next few centuries, so it is important to understand changes on the TEIS, which controls much of TG's flow into the ocean. Our results suggest that the TEIS is progressively destabilizing and is likely to disintegrate over the next few decades.\n\nMechanics and dynamics of pinning points on the Shirase Coast, West Antarctica\n\nHolly Still and Christina Hulbe\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 2647–2665, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2647-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-2647-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPinning points, locations where floating ice shelves run aground, modify ice flow and thickness. We use a model to quantify the Ross Ice Shelf and tributary ice stream response to a group of pinning points. Ice stream sensitivity to pinning points is conditioned by basal drag, and thus basal properties, upstream of the grounding line. Without the pinning points, a redistribution of resistive stresses supports faster flow and increased mass flux but with a negligible change in total ice volume.\n\nEvidence for a grounding line fan at the onset of a basal channel under the ice shelf of Support Force Glacier, Antarctica, revealed by reflection seismics\n\nCoen Hofstede, Sebastian Beyer, Hugh Corr, Olaf Eisen, Tore Hattermann, Veit Helm, Niklas Neckel, Emma C. Smith, Daniel Steinhage, Ole Zeising, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1517–1535, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1517-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1517-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSupport Force Glacier rapidly flows into Filcher Ice Shelf of Antarctica. As we know little about this glacier and its subglacial drainage, we used seismic energy to map the transition area from grounded to floating ice where a drainage channel enters the ocean cavity. Soft sediments close to the grounding line are probably transported by this drainage channel. The constant ice thickness over the steeply dipping seabed of the ocean cavity suggests a stable transition and little basal melting.\n\nThe 32-year record-high surface melt in 2019/2020 on the northern George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula\n\nAlison F. Banwell, Rajashree Tri Datta, Rebecca L. Dell, Mahsa Moussavi, Ludovic Brucker, Ghislain Picard, Christopher A. Shuman, and Laura A. Stevens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 909–925, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-909-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-909-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves are thick floating layers of glacier ice extending from the glaciers on land that buttress much of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and help to protect it from losing ice to the ocean. However, the stability of ice shelves is vulnerable to meltwater lakes that form on their surfaces during the summer. This study focuses on the northern George VI Ice Shelf on the western side of the AP, which had an exceptionally long and extensive melt season in 2019/2020 compared to the previous 31 seasons.\n\nThe 2020 Larsen C Ice Shelf surface melt is a 40-year record high\n\nSuzanne Bevan, Adrian Luckman, Harry Hendon, and Guomin Wang\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3551–3564, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3551-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3551-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn February 2020, along with record-breaking high temperatures in the region, satellite images showed that the surface of the largest remaining ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula was experiencing a lot of melt. Using archived satellite data we show that this melt was greater than any in the past 40 years. The extreme melt followed unusual weather patterns further north, highlighting the importance of long-range links between the tropics and high latitudes and the impact on ice-shelf stability.\n\nDiagnosing the sensitivity of grounding-line flux to changes in sub-ice-shelf melting\n\nTong Zhang, Stephen F. Price, Matthew J. Hoffman, Mauro Perego, and Xylar Asay-Davis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3407–3424, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3407-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3407-2020, 2020\n\nA protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections\n\nNicolas C. Jourdain, Xylar Asay-Davis, Tore Hattermann, Fiammetta Straneo, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Christopher M. Little, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3111–3134, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo predict the future Antarctic contribution to sea level rise, we need to use ice sheet models. The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for AR6 (ISMIP6) builds an ensemble of ice sheet projections constrained by atmosphere and ocean projections from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). In this work, we present and assess a method to derive ice shelf basal melting in ISMIP6 from the CMIP6 ocean outputs, and we give examples of projected melt rates.\n\nLateral meltwater transfer across an Antarctic ice shelf\n\nRebecca Dell, Neil Arnold, Ian Willis, Alison Banwell, Andrew Williamson, Hamish Pritchard, and Andrew Orr\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2313–2330, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2313-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2313-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA semi-automated method is developed from pre-existing work to track surface water bodies across Antarctic ice shelves over time, using data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. This method is applied to the Nivlisen Ice Shelf for the 2016–2017 melt season. The results reveal two large linear meltwater systems, which hold 63 % of the peak total surface meltwater volume on 26 January 2017. These meltwater systems migrate towards the ice shelf front as the melt season progresses.\n\nIce shelf rift propagation: stability, three-dimensional effects, and the role of marginal weakening\n\nBradley Paul Lipovsky\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1673–1683, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1673-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1673-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce shelves promote the stability of marine ice sheets and therefore reduce the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. Ice shelf rifts are through-cutting fractures that jeopardize this stabilizing tendency. Here, I carry out the first-ever 3D modeling of ice shelf rifts. I find that the overall ice shelf geometry – particularly the ice shelf margins – alters rift stability. This work paves the way to a more realistic depiction of rifting in ice sheet models.\n\nGetz Ice Shelf melt enhanced by freshwater discharge from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nWei Wei, Donald D. Blankenship, Jamin S. Greenbaum, Noel Gourmelen, Christine F. Dow, Thomas G. Richter, Chad A. Greene, Duncan A. Young, SangHoon Lee, Tae-Wan Kim, Won Sang Lee, and Karen M. Assmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 1399–1408, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1399-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1399-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGetz Ice Shelf is the largest meltwater source from Antarctica of the Southern Ocean. This study compares the relative importance of the meltwater production of Getz from both ocean and subglacial sources. We show that basal melt rates are elevated where bathymetric troughs provide pathways for warm Circumpolar Deep Water to enter the Getz Ice Shelf cavity. In particular, we find that subshelf melting is enhanced where subglacially discharged fresh water flows across the grounding line.\n\nDifferential interferometric synthetic aperture radar for tide modelling in Antarctic ice-shelf grounding zones\n\nChristian T. Wild, Oliver J. Marsh, and Wolfgang Rack\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 3171–3191, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-3171-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn Antarctica, ocean tides control the motion of ice sheets near the coastline as well as melt rates underneath the floating ice. By combining the spatial advantage of rare but highly accurate satellite images with the temporal advantage of tide-prediction models, vertical displacement of floating ice due to ocean tides can now be predicted accurately. This allows the detailed study of ice-flow dynamics in areas that matter the most to the stability of Antarctica's ice sheets.\n\nIce shelf basal melt rates from a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) record for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica\n\nDavid E. Shean, Ian R. Joughin, Pierre Dutrieux, Benjamin E. Smith, and Etienne Berthier\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2633–2656, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2633-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2633-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe produced an 8-year, high-resolution DEM record for Pine Island Glacier (PIG), a site of substantial Antarctic mass loss in recent decades. We developed methods to study the spatiotemporal evolution of ice shelf basal melting, which is responsible for ~ 60 % of PIG mass loss. We present shelf-wide basal melt rates and document relative melt rates for kilometer-scale basal channels and keels, offering new indirect observations of ice–ocean interaction beneath a vulnerable ice shelf.\n\nSpatial and temporal variations in basal melting at Nivlisen ice shelf, East Antarctica, derived from phase-sensitive radars\n\nKatrin LindbÃ¤ck, Geir Moholdt, Keith W. Nicholls, Tore Hattermann, Bhanu Pratap, Meloth Thamban, and Kenichi Matsuoka\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 2579–2595, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2579-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-2579-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we used a ground-penetrating radar technique to measure melting at high precision under Nivlisen, an ice shelf in central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica. We found that summer-warmed ocean surface waters can increase melting close to the ice shelf front. Our study shows the use of and need for measurements in the field to monitor Antarctica's coastal margins; these detailed variations in basal melting are not captured in satellite data but are vital to predict future changes.\n\nPast and future dynamics of the Brunt Ice Shelf from seabed bathymetry and ice shelf geometry\n\nDominic A. Hodgson, Tom A. Jordan, Jan De Rydt, Peter T. Fretwell, Samuel A. Seddon, David Becker, Kelly A. Hogan, Andrew M. Smith, and David G. Vaughan\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 545–556, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-545-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica is home to Halley VIa, the latest in a series of six British research stations that have occupied the ice shelf since 1956. A recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf signals the onset of its largest calving event since records began. Here we consider whether this calving event will lead to a new steady state for the ice shelf or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow or collapse.\n\nCited articles\n\nAlley, K.
