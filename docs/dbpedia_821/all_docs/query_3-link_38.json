        "text": "Independent producer David Thwaites has joined Miramax in the newly-created position of VP of film, the company announced Monday.\n\nReporting to Zanne Devine, executive VP of film and TV, Thwaites will head Miramax’s burgeoning film production and development activities as the studio continues its push into new content areas, including film, television, acquisitions and co-productions.\n\n“I’m thrilled to be joining the fantastic team at Miramax,” said Thwaites (pictured above at the premiere of “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”). “I can’t wait to begin working on Miramax’s rich and diverse development slate, and I look forward to bringing in new projects for all of us to dive into.”\n\n“We are very excited to boost our growing production and development activities with an industry executive of David’s caliber. David has great network reach, creative intuition and production savvy,” added Devine.\n\nThwaites most recently produced “Crouching Tiger II: The Green Destiny.” He also served as co-president of production at Phoenix Pictures, where he led the development of many projects and nurtured relationships with writers, directors and actors. During his tenure at Phoenix he produced and executive produced films such as Darren Aronofsky‘s Oscar-nominated “Black Swan,” the Cameron Diaz comedy “What to Expect When You’re Expecting,” “Shanghai,” “License to Wed,” “Miss Potter” and “All the King’s Men.”"
