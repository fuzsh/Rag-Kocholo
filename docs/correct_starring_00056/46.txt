Biography[]

Pirates of the Caribbean[]

Paul McCartney portrayed Uncle Jack for the fifth film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. The character was named after McCartney's own uncle, John "Jack" McCartney.[1][2] According to directors Rønning and Sandberg, Paul McCartney's character Uncle Jack takes the role that would have been filled by Keith Richards as Captain Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague. However, when Richards was unavailable, reportedly because of scheduling issues, the directing duo brainstormed with Johnny Depp, believing they should "honour the tradition of showing a Jack Sparrow family member." Depp texted Paul McCartney, who agreed to appear in the film.[3] But due to his demanding schedule during the main shoot of the film in Australia, McCartney wasn't free to make it happen until the Vancouver shoot.[4] Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson created an appropriate scene for Depp and McCartney, to which the duo then added their own very particular and personal spin.[2]
