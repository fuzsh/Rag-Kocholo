        "text": "This June, I attended a wedding in a bright, steamy garden in New Orleans, in which a procession of small children entered to “Sun King,” from “Abbey Road.” The scene immediately felt magical: When have you heard “Sun King” in a garden? The wonderful deep-cut weirdness of the later Beatles albums doesn’t tend to interact with public life. Then, in a daring solar-musical shift, “Here Comes the Sun”—and the bride entered, dazzling us, as if alighting from the heavens.\n\nIf I had a religion, the Beatles—or possibly the Velvet Underground, or trees—would be it. But until this autumn, when I saw Paul McCartney at Madison Square Garden, I had never heard any former Beatle in concert. I had never tried to. I’d always had an ineffable feeling that the Beatles exist in our memory, in our headphones, in our imagination, somewhere above and beyond us. Seeing Paul or Ringo, I’d assumed, wouldn’t conjure that aura. Another reason I’d never tried to see McCartney in particular was McCartney himself. I’ve only lived in the decades of post-Beatles McCartney—regular guy of whatever era you were in. In the seventies, my parents scoffed at Wings; in the eighties, I scoffed at “Give My Regards to Broad Street” and “The Girl Is Mine” (which, as far as I’m concerned, remains a comic high point of the twentieth century). Later, I’d get wary when he’d show up on some televised event and plunk out an earnest “Hey Jude.” All of that helped me take McCartney for granted.\n\nThe passage of time has changed my perspective entirely. So has the brutality of the world. When George Harrison died, I was devastated and a little shocked. Suddenly, I thought, What are you doing not seeing Paul in concert? We only go around once! This summer, I heard that McCartney was coming to Madison Square Garden in September, and I made plans to go. It’s 2017, and the world is a disaster. Donald Trump is President, Arctic ice is melting, publications are folding, the Noho Star is closing. And yet you can just go see Paul McCartney in concert. At this point, it seems like hubris not to.\n\nThe tempus-fugit scenario in which I had arranged to see McCartney sharpened acutely in September. The week of the concert, a dear friend of mine died. In those raw first days, all I understood was grief, consoling, being consoled, and love for my departed friend. The rest of life—eating things, finding an unwrinkled skirt to wear, writing about podcasts—was just confused bumbling. The next morning, I would be taking a train to Philadelphia for a memorial; tonight, I was seeing McCartney, with a beloved companion who understood.\n\nMcCartney came onstage waving, shaking a fist in the air. There he was. He looked youthful as ever—fluffy brown hair, wrinkled boyish face, jacket with chevrons on the sleeve. Then he and his band played the thrilling, mysterious opening chord of “A Hard Day’s Night.” I just about lost my mind. How was I hearing Paul play a faithful, electrifying “Hard Day’s Night”? Suddenly, I was a kid again, holding the record sleeve in my hands—red border, black-and-white Beatles grid, four photographs showing a set of dark eyes under a set of dark bangs. I remember trying to determine if they were all the same person—and also if they were, somehow, my dad. My parents had divorced when I was two, and I saw him every few weeks. He was jocular and fun. The Beatles all resembled him, and his haircut. The “Hard Day’s Night” cover rattled me, and then it intrigued me. Then I was hooked. I absorbed their albums as I grew. The early stuff—“Love Me Do” and “She Loves You” and “Help!”—was for swinging on the swing in my bedroom doorway; the White Album was for dancing with my mom; “Sgt. Pepper” was for building forts while she worked at our family’s seed company; “Rubber Soul” was for reading Nancy Drew. And so on.\n\nMcCartney made a gesture like, Ooh, sizzling! He is so lovably himself: a little corny, extremely amiable, a friendly pop genius. Green lights flashed, and the band went right into “Junior’s Farm.” McCartney made his impish McCartney expressions. “Good evening, New York City!” he said. “It’s so good to be back. We’re going to play some old stuff, we’re gonna play some new stuff, and I’ve got a feeling that we’re going to have some fun.” I was still processing the fact that I was in the same room as Paul McCartney, even if it was a very big room.\n\nSuddenly, he was playing “Can’t Buy Me Love.” Onscreen behind him, there were young John Lennon and young George Harrison running through the train station in “A Hard Day’s Night,” falling down, mucking about. There was young Ringo, lying in the grass. In the movie, “Can’t Buy Me Love” signals joy, more than once, and the film’s shots enhance that joy—bursting out of doors, leaping into the air. Then McCartney played “Jet”—soaring clouds onscreen, theatrical fog onstage, euphoria all over. He followed that with the dreamy “All My Loving.” Above us, two women swayed while clutching their hearts.\n\nPaul has always been a cozy Beatle, and a cozy post-Beatle. That day, I’d been thinking about “When I’m Sixty-Four,” about a lonelyheart wanting to live a quiet life of companionable fuse-mending and sweater-knitting, written (in a “rooty-tooty variety style,” McCartney has said) when he was around fifteen and recorded when he was a twenty-four-year-old at the height of virility and world domination. At seventy-five, he’s still a genuine rock star, even a sex symbol of sorts—after “All My Loving,” he removed his jacket and the crowd roared—but a companionable one. Later, when he read signs that people held up—“I Heart You More Than Mashed Potatoes”; “Sign My Butt?”—he sounded both wizened and like an innocent. He doesn’t give you the leathery-aged-hedonism feeling that many of his peers do. He’s not a leerer. He gives the impression that he’s just a person, and this is part of why we love him. He’s a musical genius who’s lived one of the craziest lives imaginable and known plenty of darkness, but outwardly, at least, he’s maintained a quality of straightforward good cheer.\n\nDuring “Maybe I’m Amazed,” we saw the photo from the back cover of “McCartney,” from 1970—Paul, beardy and happy, with his and Linda’s baby Mary tucked inside his fur-lined jacket. This, too, I’d listened to, and stared at, as a child: red berries on a white surface, black-and-white bowl, red juice, jolly family with a sheepdog. It mesmerized me, all of it. I began to read about the Beatles: my mom’s book “Shout!,” in which I learned about everybody’s relationships; my dad’s copy of “The Book of Rock Lists,” which he had won from a radio station, and which I read with interest in a green velvet scoop chair at his apartment. In my research, I’d learned that “Martha My Dear” was about the sheepdog pictured on “McCartney”; the album, to me, looked and sounded like domestic bliss, with warmth I recognized from my own unconventional family. I recently learned that McCartney was struggling while writing “McCartney”—Beatles breaking up, John out, Paul drinking—and that Linda had supported and encouraged him to make his own music. Knowing these things makes “Maybe I’m Amazed” sound even lovelier: its vulnerability, its admiration, its gorgeous snaking piano.\n\n“This is a night full of memories for me,” McCartney said. He talked about recording “Love Me Do” at Abbey Road, and about George Martin. (“George turns to me and says, ‘Paul, would you mind doing the ‘Love me do’ line?’ I was petrified.”) Here, the vocal-on-harmonica action really hit the spot. My friend said, “He’s going to play ‘And I Love Her.’ ” He was right. In front of us, a tween boy and his mother linked arms and danced.\n\nA few off notes pierced the bliss. McCartney told us that he’d written “Blackbird” in solidarity with the American civil-rights movement, a fact I hadn’t heard before; as we contemplated this information, which made the song’s lyrics seem condescending (Broken wings? Sunken eyes? What?), he rose up on a glowing white cube, performing from on high. Flowers bloomed onscreen. “Is he going to float over us?” my friend asked. It’s a weird move to praise yourself in the name of civil rights and then raise yourself aloft. This, and “Lady Madonna,” paired with footage of inspiring women, wore me out.\n\n“After my dear friend John passed away—let’s hear it for John!” McCartney said, pumping his fist. We cheered for John. He played “Here Today”—a song in the form of “a conversation we didn’t get to have,” he said.\n\n“When we play a Beatles song, the room lights up like a galaxy,” he said, happily. “When we play a new song, it’s like a black hole. But we don’t care. We’re going to play them anyway.”\n\nHe shifted abruptly from his newest song, “FourFiveSeconds,” a collaboration with Rihanna and Kanye West, which baffles me—are we to believe that Paul McCartney is four, five seconds from wildin’?—to “Eleanor Rigby,” a song that, I’ve discovered, feels much different in middle age than it did when I was eight. I wished that a philharmonic could join in, a string section sawing away the anguish. “I Wanna Be Your Man” made me think of my twenties, when I rediscovered the “Hard Day’s Night” movie, and Ringo dancing hilariously at the night club—a scene that treats us to the rare joy of seeing the Beatles at a party, dancing to the Beatles. “Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!” was another astonishment, its surreality full and real, augmented by “Yellow Submarine”-style clouds floating behind Paul onscreen as he sang about Messrs. K. and H. being second to none. My whole life was unfurling in a kaleidoscope of eras and memories.\n\nMcCartney pulled out a ukulele. “George Harrison was a very good ukulele player,” he said. “Let’s hear it for Georgie!” I loved the way he was dealing with these losses: nothing gloomy, just a big “Let’s hear it” for everybody. (Let’s hear it for my friend Michael!, I thought.) He began to play “Something” solo, on ukulele. I happen to love the soppy gorgeousness of the studio version of that song, the emotions lolling around in an orchestral bath. I also love George’s uke-playing, but I didn’t want a ukulele here—I wanted the beautiful glop. The crowd was wailing, “I don’t know, I don’t know!” Then, thrillingly, Paul crossed the stage to his guitar, the rest of the band joined in, and the full beauty of the song came together. Paul played the great guitar solo and pictures of George showed onscreen, and of Ringo with a hell of a mustache. I no longer feel that Paul is too easy with Beatles nostalgia—I’m just grateful for his presence, and that some of us are alive.\n\n“This is a song I wrote with my mate John,” he said. He played “A Day in the Life.” The drums were exact, and the harmonies were, too; the extended “I’d love to turn you on” section built and built, just the way you wanted it to. Daisies bloomed onscreen. I cried and it felt good. Hearing the madness of the George Martin wizardry, the John Lennon “Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall” part, merging into Paul’s wonderful “Woke up, got out of bed” section, delivered by Paul himself, was heaven. At the bouncing “somebody spoke and I went into a dream,” lights shone gorgeously. But then the song segued—not into its glorious, improbable finale, which sounds like an orchestra being sucked into a vacuum cleaner—but into “Give Peace a Chance.”\n\nI adore John and Yoko, but I rarely adore “Give Peace a Chance”—and without its raggedy beginning, and without being delivered by two longhairs protesting in a bed, it loses its edge. I wanted to hear the end of “A Day in the Life”—to feel its full power, not have it frittered away in a peace-sign montage. But I couldn’t be mad at McCartney. I waited pleasantly for it to play itself out, and found myself thinking of the way I had waited for various odd moments to pass in some of the funerals I had been to in 2017. This year, there have been many funerals, and many odd moments—a confused speech, a treacly song in a memories slide show. During these, I have willed myself not to be made uncomfortable, to ride them out. We are all doing the best we can. In these moments, the point is to be there together, and to feel love. Onscreen, as if to reinforce this idea, there was footage of the crowd I was in now: baby boomers in drapey sweaters; kids holding up peace-sign fingers; a woman with elaborate “Sgt. Pepper” puppets.\n\nThen—a thrill! And a transition that surely would have annoyed John: “Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da,” crashing into existence with McCartney’s banging piano. I’ve always loved the songs of Paul’s that John considered granny music, the music-hall stuff. I listen to “Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da” a surprising amount, sometimes while charging down the sidewalk with headphones. McCartney wanted us to sing the “La!”s at the end, but we all sang the whole goddam thing."
