        "text": "Paul McCartney’s animated feature film, High in the Clouds, has set a director, writer, composer, and more, Variety reports. The film, which has been in development since 2009 and is adapted from McCartney’s own 2005 children's book, is slated to begin production next year. Coco and Inside Out composer Michael Giacchino will handle the score, with Jon Croker writing and Toby Genkel directing. It also reportedly features six new original songs from McCartney.\n\nHigh in the Clouds follows “a headstrong teenage squirrel, Wirral, who lives in Gretschville, a city where music has been banned by a diva-owl, Gretsch, who wants to be the only singer in town,” per a plot synopsis. McCartney reportedly voices a main character in the film adaptation. Since High in the Clouds, McCartney has written the children’s books Hey Grandude! and Grandude’s Green Submarine."
