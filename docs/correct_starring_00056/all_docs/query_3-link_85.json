        "text": "With Paul McCartney having just played from what I understand two spectacular shows at Fenway Park in Boston, I figured I would throw in my two cents on Paul playing live at 80 years old. Well, I say 80... but Paul is actually turning 80 on June 18th. Close enough.\n\nI was not at either of the Fenway shows, but I was fortunate to have been at the show at the JMA Wireless Dome (the former Carrier Dome) in Syracuse, New York on Saturday night (June 4th).\n\nA Berkshire Paul McCartney Fan's Perspective...\n\nFirst, I have to say that Sir Paul certainly doesn't act his age. I mean that in the best of ways of course. He put on a show that was very close to three hours on Saturday that despite the sore backside I had from sitting on the metal bleacher seats for all that time, was one of the most amazing shows that I have attended. I went in expecting awesomeness, and that is just what Paul delivered. He was all over the stage. If you squinted, you might think you were watching the Paul of old instead of the old Paul.\n\nPaul and his amazing band spanned the decades of Paul's endless song catalog with The Beatles, Wings, and his solo material. They didn't just cruise through the songs either. They really rocked the house! I will say that Paul, vocally anyway, has lost a step to some degree, but his musicianship was as great as it has ever been. Just amazing!\n\nI have no doubt that the shows at Fenway Park were every bit as incredible. I know several people who attended those shows and have heard nothing but good things!\n\nI will say that if you are a Paul McCartney fan and you have never seen him live... you should make it a point to catch him the next time he comes around. You won't regret it!\n\nThe view from my seat...\n\nHere are a few photos from the show at the JMA Wireless Dome in Syracuse, NY on June 4th that you can check out. I can't post any videos here because of the song copyrights, but hey... if you wanna see the three videos I shot and more pictures... you can visit my Facebook page on your own. I welcome your visit.\n\nIf you are wondering what Paul and the boys played... Here is the setlist:\n\nCan’t Buy Me Love\n\nJunior’s Farm\n\nLetting Go\n\nGot to Get You Into My Life\n\nCome On to Me\n\nLet Me Roll It\n\nGetting Better\n\nLet ‘Em In\n\nMy Valentine\n\nNineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\n\nMaybe I’m Amazed\n\nI’ve Just Seen a Face\n\nIn Spite of All the Danger (a song from The Quarrymen)\n\nLove Me Do\n\nDance Tonight\n\nBlackbird\n\nHere Today (which he did in tribute to John Lennon)\n\nNew\n\nLady Madonna\n\nFuh You\n\nBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\n\nSomething\n\nOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\n\nYou Never Give Me Your Money\n\nShe Came in Through the Bathroom Window\n\nGet Back\n\nBand on the Run\n\nLet It Be\n\nLive and Let Die\n\nHey Jude\n\nENCORE:\n\nI’ve Got a Feeling (a virtual duet with John Lennon)\n\nBirthday\n\nHelter Skelter\n\nGolden Slumbers\n\nCarry That Weight\n\nThe End"
