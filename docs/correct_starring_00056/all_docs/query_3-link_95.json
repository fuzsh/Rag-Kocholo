        "text": "Here’s everything we know about the four movies about The Beatles.\n\nEach movie will focus on a different member of The Beatles\n\nAccording to the press release, each movie will be from the perspective of a different member of the band, meaning Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr will each have their own biopic.\n\nIt’s the first time that the band’s company, Apple Corps Ltd., has given permission for the group’s life story and music to be used in a scripted film about them.\n\nSince 1979, 18 unauthorized biopics have been made about the band including 2009’s “Knowhere Boy\" starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lennon and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McCartney.\n\nThe release also says that the four movies “will intersect to tell the astonishing story of the greatest band in history.” Yes, Mendes is effectively giving audiences The Beatles Cinematic Universe, so get those “Avengers” jokes out of the way now.\n\nSam Mendes will have 'no limits' telling The Beatles’ story\n\nIn an interview with Deadline published on Tuesday, Pippa Harris, who will produce the films, said the band’s surviving members, McCartney and Starr, have given their blessing for Mendes to work on the four films.\n\nRelated stories\n\n“It’s a testament to his creative brilliance and powers of persuasion that Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Sean Lennon, and Olivia Harrison responded with such warmth and enthusiasm as soon as he spoke with them,” she said, referring to John Lennon's son and George Harrison's widow.\n\nHarris went on to say that Mendes will have no restrictions on what he depicts from the band members’ lives.\n\nShe said: “What is truly exciting is for Sam to have the freedom to delve into the lives of each of the Beatles, with nothing off limits and no sense of the band wanting him to tell a particular ‘authorised’ version of their rise to success.”\n\nStarr also gave his blessing on Tuesday via a post on X.\n\nNobody has been cast yet, but The Beatles movies should be released in 2027\n\nMendes is the only big name attached to all four movies as director, and no actors have been cast as Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, or Starr as of yet.\n\nPer the press release, Sony is looking to release all four movies about The Beatles in 2027, which gives Mendes plenty of time to find the right people to play the Liverpudlian superstars.\n\nCorrection: March 1, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated the director of the film \"No Time to Die.\" Cary Joji Fukunaga directed the film, not Sam Mendes."
