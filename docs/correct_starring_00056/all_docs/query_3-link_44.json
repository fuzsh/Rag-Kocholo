        "text": "Yesterday Film Review: “ A FAIRY TALE/ CARTOON” by Alan Chrisman, copyright.\n\nWith the recent Beatles influenced film, Yesterday, I wanted to see it in a theater, but I waited until it hit my local second-run movie house(I usually wait until the hype has boiled down on these things to make up my own mind). I knew its basic plot about a young aspiring immigrant musician in England being in a bus accident and going into a fantasy that when he wakes up no one else had remembered Beatles’ songs, but himself. But soon after, he starts singing them and claiming he wrote them, and he’s about to become the biggest pop star on the planet. At first, it seemed the movie was a combination of director, Danny Boyle’s (Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting) and screenwriter, Richard Curtis’ quirky Brit. Rom- Coms., usually staring Hugh Grant (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill) previous movies. Or Slumdog Millionaire meets Bridget Jones- but with a Beatles song track-which in many ways, it was. Interestingly, the back story is somewhat similar to the recent Queen bio.–pic., Bohemian Rhapsody, about real life immigrant , Freddie Mercury, wanting to become the next big pop star too. I thought upon viewing that film that it was almost a caricature , especially with the lead actor equipped with an excess of fake teeth, supposedly because Mercury had a larger mouth with more teeth than normal, which partly accounted for his wider range vocals in his songs and with his exaggerated mannerisms(although it was supposed to be a true story).\n\nThe characters in Yesterday are also almost carictures too. The musician, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel( Bit. soap opera, Eastenders) and his childhood friend, first manager, and eventual crush, Ellie( played by Lily James from Downton Abbey) are almost too wide-eyed naïve and innocent to be true( certainly in these times). They become pitted against the stereotyped Big Bad Music Business, personified by the Evil New Manager, played by Saturday Night Live comedian, Katherine McKinnon. Her portrayal, especially, is way over the top and extreme, almost like the evil nemesis Cruella de Vil in Disney’s original cartoon, One Hundred and One Dalmations. I thought at first this movie was meant to be taken straight. But later I realized the whole film was not only a fantasy, in the lead characters head, but in ours too. The film was actually, I think, a more like cartoon. Much as the 2nd Beatles film, Help was. Even though Beatles fans at the time, despite its silly plot (something about Ringo being chased around for his ring) took it seriously as a continuation of their first Marx Brothers-compared movie classic, A Hard Day’s Night. Even though the Beatles themselves knew better (spending most of the time on set for Help, high on pot and and giggling to themselves at the absurdity of it all). “We were extras in our own film.”, Lennon later said.\n\nLike Help, what saves Yesterday is, of course, Beatles’ music. It also strangely reminded me of the Beatles cartoon, Yellow Submarine (which The Beatles themselves had little to do with in the making). Yesterday, at some points as when it visits Liverpool landmarks, puts Yellow Submarine-like big colorful titles of some of their songs across the screen. But it also continued the clichéd arc of films these days about pop music and rock stars: starting out unknown; being discovered virtually overnight (in Yesterday’s case, current pop idol, Ed Sheeran, playing himself, shows up at Jacks door); then getting caught up in the fame and temptations of the Music Business, but in the end( despite many rock stars in real life dying of their own excesses)– but that’s okay because their music will out survive them- goes the usual theme. So the myths continue. But in this fairy tale , of course, the hero comes to his senses and recognizes the error of his ways and they live happily ever after(“Ob La Di Ob La DA. Life Goes on Bra).” There’s also a scene with talk show host, James Cordon, doing his usual in real life fawning to rock and movie stars, which I think was meant to be a satire of the media coverage today and how they both build you up and then tear you down with the next breath. Ironically, it was Cordon who took Paul back to his childhood house in Liverpool last year. Paul probably only did it being the savy PR man he is, to promote his latest album, Egypt Station.\n\nThe audience I saw it with was almost entirely Baby Boomers. When it first came out, on several Beatles sites, Boomers defended the film because they said it would allow younger generations to rediscover Beatles music (even in this watered down form) and hoped to take their own children and grandchildren to see it. I thought it was revealing that my generation was so insecure about their own music, that they were even worried about this. I’m not, for the Beatles will be known, I’m sure, not only for their music, but because they also changed the wider culture. We don’t really know what pop music will be like in a hundred years or more from now. Maybe those grainy black and white photos and films of them playing on Ed Sullivan will be like us watching old silent films from the 20’s and 30’s. But just like we know the best of that era still, Chaplin, Keaton, and the Marx Bros. when people look back on our century the Beatles will be a part of it. Because they also represent a time of historical change, the 60s(which in turn affected them to change too). There’s a scene at the end of Yesterday, where, a character, (you-know-who) makes a brief appearance. The audience actually gets quiet as they recognize him(even though I thought it didn’t look that much like him or especially sound like him), as we waited for the icon he has become, words of wisdom(to borrow Paul’s expression). But then its right back to Beatles covers. The Beatles and publishers reportedly got $10 Million alone for the use of their songs.\n\nIt would be curious to see what young people do see in the film, not having the baggage we do about our own music and memories. They might see the film more like a graphic novel, which ironically, there was a French one in 2011 called Yesterday, with a similar theme (which would fit in with my theory that the film is really more of a cartoon). But I don’t think most of the audience (or the critics, who gave it mixed reviews ) understand this. Most of the audience were just taping their toes along to the catchy nostalgia of it all (I noticed most of the songs were McCartney ones). I overheard a lady next to me tell her friend that the actor in that climatic scene was played by his son, Julian. I responded that, no it wasn’t, but that if it had of been, it might have looked more like him. And that I had met his mother, Cynthia. We both stayed to watch as the credits rolled to see who was playing the part, but it didn’t seem to be listed. Research later showed it was Scottish actor (no wonder his accent seemed confused) Robert Carlyle, from the previous Boyle film, Trainspotting. Then that woman said, “Well, the music today is not as good as our music.” I realized that each generation is caught up in its own little bubble. Yesterday was a light bubble of a film, whose Beatles’ songs saved it from bursting into reality. I came with a couple of friends: my ex-wife, whom said afterwards she didn’t get the film, but who usually likes Hugh Grant movies and happy endings. Part of that may be because we arrived a few minutes late and she didn’t realize it was a fantasy inside the lead characters’ head. My male friend, who also came with us and who’s into early 60’s music, liked the character of Ellie( and the actress who played her, Lily James). He dreams in real life of women like her, which I joked probably don’t even exist anymore, since perhaps 1962, or in movies such as this. In some ways, her character and the film, reminded me of an innocence long gone by. Which is why, “Yesterday”, I maintain, is basically a Baby Boomer fantasy and cartoon. I also saw later, the Rocketman film about Elton John. There’s a scene in it in the Beatles music publisher, Dick James( who did later represent Elton John) office where Reg Dwight(” Elton John”) looks at a picture of the Beatles on the wall and the film makes it look like Elton got his name from Lennon- but it isn’t true. Elton John was actually named after Brit. blues singer, Long JOHN Baldry, and after ELTON Dean (later of the Soft Machine) who, along with an early Rod Stewart, was in Baldry’s band. The Elton John song “ Somebody Saved my Life Today” was about when Elton almost tried to commit suicide, after his failed relationship with a woman, and Baldry had helped talk him out of it(their both having to come to grips with being gay), at a time when in England it was still illegal. The film should have at least got this right about where Elton got his name. Yet despite that, I thought Rocketman was a better film than either Bohemian Rhapsody or Yesterday. It had more original imagination( and real feeling ) in it than Yesterday or Rhapsody. If you’re going to make a cliched rock film, you should least come up a few new ways to do it.\n\nby Alan Chrisman, copyright.\n\nLet’s just suppose John Lennon hadn’t met Paul McCartney; how would things have been different?\n\nOr what if they had passed their Decca Records audition? They might have been forced to record someone else’s songs, like Mitch Murray’s “How Do You Do it”. Decca might have released a single and it might have become a minor hit. And on that supposed Decca album there might even have been, unnoticed, one of their early original songs like “Like Dreamers Do” . Or what if Brian Epstein hadn’t decided to manage them, would they have ever made it out of Liverpool, then London, let alone America? And if George Martin hadn’t signed them, would any other producer had allowed them to do their own songs or experiment with new sounds? Would there have been a Revolver or Peppers without him and his innovative engineers? On the other hand, Martin, without them, might have only become known for his James Bond soundtracks and comedy records.\n\nHow would that have changed music in Britain? Would it, after skiffle had faded in a year or two, have reverted back to imitating U.S. pop stars and sounds. Without The Beatles leading the assault on America would there have been a British Invasion? No English bands had before made much of a mark on American shores. What if Kennedy hadn’t recently been assassinated and the pop charts weren’t filled with clean-cut white “Bobby Bobbys”, as Jerry Lee Lewis called them, because most of the 50’s often black founders of rock’n’roll had vacated the spots for various reasons. So there was a real vacuum to fill.\n\nOf course, the 60’s would still have happened, civil rights and anti-Vietnam demonstrations and drugs and acid rock from California. In England, some Brit. bands like the Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, and Animals would have still copied their blues heroes. But how many would have written their own songs if Lennon/McCartney hadn’t shown that it was possible? Would Brian Wilson have gone against his record company and some of his fellow Beach Boys, wanting to move past just writing about girls, cars and surfing? Although he was already experimenting with pot and sound textures, without Rubber Soul, would he made the Good Vibrations of Pet Sounds? And even Bob Dylan , already with a following on college campuses with his protest songs, but also craving a mass audience, having been booed for going electric, if he hadn’t heard “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and recognizing that “was where music had to go.”? Would his new direction have been accepted by the general public without the revitalization of rock by the The Beatles too? What if there had been no Hard Days’ Night movie and The Byrds’ Roger McGuinn hadn’t seen George Harrison’s Rickenbacker guitar and decided to put it together with Dylan’s folk and help popularize folk-rock? Pop music might have just remained entertainment for teenagers, but The Beatles, especially, showed that it could be so much more- even art.\n\nWhat might each Beatle have done instead? Would Paul have become a teacher as his mother wanted; perhaps at Liverpool Institute where he might have become a headmaster? Or with his natural musical talent, he might have become a Prof. of Music and composed a classical piece about his childhood called, “Liverpool Oratorio.” Or he might have become just a songwriter providing songs for pop singers like Welsh singer, Tom Jones(whom in real life turned down “Long And Winding Road”). Or perhaps with his boyish good looks and charm, he might have been the next pop idol a la Cliff Richard and had hits with his ballads “Yesterday” and ” Michelle.” But unlikely then, he would have been allowed to display his more rocky side, such as “She Loves You” “Lady Madonna” or “Paperback Writer”. Although he could have still had massive hits with his own songs, “Hey Jude” or “Let It Be”. Or maybe he might have gone another way and become like an Andrew Lloyd Weber and written a show for Broadway based on a character whom had a lonely wedding called “Eleanor Rigby”. That’s all possible.\n\nGeorge Harrison, might have joined his mate, Jackie Lomax’ Liverpool band, The Undertakers, and they might have written together a guitar instrumental, like “Cry For A Shadow. But unlikely anything as majestic as “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” or “Something” or “My Sweet Lord”, with Lennon/ McCartney not providing him expert competition.\n\nAnd Ringo? After Rory Storm broke up, his drum skills would have gotten him steady work in several Liverpool bands and he’d have been a regular at Butlins’ Holiday camps. And maybe opened a hair dressing shop and married its hairdresser, Maureen. In short, he would still have been Ringo.\n\nBut what of John Lennon-if he hadn’t met Paul? After his teenage band, The Quarry Men, fell apart, would “Johnnie” Lennon, as he might have been called, like his estranged father, “Freddie”, have become a Liverpool pub entertainer, playing old rock covers(and perhaps an occasional original tune), when he wasn’t in jail for getting in drunken fights? Or might he have done stand-up comedy like his Dove Dale Primary School classmate, Jimmy Tarbuck? Comedian Lennon, known for his politically-incorrect jokes about “cripples.” For as a Liverpool School of Art friend had said, “You will one day hit the bottle or hit the top boy and nothing in between.”\n\nWould his pub friends have believed him when he said he knew he’d always been a genius? Would there have ever been a “Strawberry Fields Forever” or “Walrus” (or “Imagine” or “Give Peace a Chance”, if he hadn’t met a Japanese avant garde artist), or a more commercial, Paul McCartney?\n\nIt took a lot of just the right circumstances and personalities and talents to all come together. Fortunately, they all did. A Beatle flapped its wings and the universe opened up-for us all.\n\nI just saw the new Beatles film, “Eight Days a Week” and these are some of my impressions. I didn’t think I would actually like it that much. The Beatlemania years, frankly, don’t interest me as much as their more interesting Liverpool and Hamburg beginnings or their more creative period in the studio. The usual story is that, most of the time, they were just going through the motions, unable to hear themselves play, with all the screaming fans’ madness (especially near the end of their “Touring Years”, as the movie’s subtitle is called).\n\nI thought director Ron (“Happy Days”) Howard might only cover the nice parts of Beatlemania. He does in the first half of the film and captures the pure energy of their early performances. He has assembled some not usually-seen footage and photos of their early concerts and appearances in Liverpool and Europe. These sometimes black and white images give it an almost old newsreel and historical feel. The film does seem primarily aimed at the North American market though. There were only a couple Liverpool interviewees included in the theatre version, except for some trusted Beatles-insiders like roadie and later Apple director, Neil Aspinall (although I understand the later-to-be-released Deluxe 2 DVD version will include more of these and lots more).\n\nHoward also puts the Beatles Invasion into context with the tumultuous events the U.S.A. was going through in the mid-60’s with the Vietman War, Civil Rights demonstrations, and the assassination of JFK, which had only happened a few months before. The American people, especially its teenagers, were certainly ready for something to lift them out of their depression. Along come these 4 English lads with the funny Liverpool accents and humor and it’s just the right medicine. The Fab Four did so with its own version of the, ironically, America’s export, rock and roll, and the simple but catchy words and rhythms of their early original songs. But what struck me again, upon seeing the film, is just how young and mainly female so many of their fans were. For by this time, The Beatles themselves were already grown men in their early 20’s, playing to some only half their age. Some of the most interesting and humorous moments for the movie audience, I was with anyway, was seeing again the complete hysteria they created in their fans (remember early attendees to their performances in the Cavern and Hamburg, evidently, didn’t originally scream).\n\nBut by ’66 and for most of the rest of the film, the whole atmosphere begins to change around The Beatles and they themselves could do little to contain it. Of course, there was the infamous “we’re more popular than Jesus” Lennon remark and the reaction it caused. But it wasn’t only in America that they began to feel a backlash; there were death threats in Japan and, in the Philippines, they barely escaped when its First Lady Imelda Marcos felt snubbed. Howard has said in interviews promoting the film, that he didn’t want to go intodark corners. But I have to give him credit for also not shying away from this part of their story too. For it seemed the once innocent teen hysteria had indeed turned into a far more dangerous form of madness. Howard includes excerpts from John and George’s recorded comments and also present day interviews with Paul and Ringo on both, the good and bad, aspects of this period.\n\nThe pall of these later more disturbing times toward the end of their touring years, which somewhat descends on the last half of the movie, is fortunately broken by his choice to also include their famous last public appearance on their Apple company’s rooftop in 1969. What this reveals once again, is that even to the end (which they would also demonstrate on their last recorded album, Abbey Road) these were first and foremost musicians and original songwriters. Once they decided to finally get off the road because of the mounting pressures they were feeling, it would also allow them more time to spend in the studio and become more and more creative artists and not just entertainers.\n\nAlso shown in the movie theater after, was a half-hour film of their ’65 Shea Stadium concert. With improved color footage and remixed sound for this project by George Martin’s son, Gilles (although some in the particular theater I was in, said the sound wasn’t that good-but it may be fine in the movie and DVD itself), it shows just how good of performers they could be, even in often chaotic conditions. Ringo says that they really did try to always give their best-all four of them. You can tell by their on-stage jokes that they are still having fun-most of the time. In the Shae Stadium show, Paul does one of his best, but perhaps underrated rockers, “I’m Down”, with which they often ended their concerts, but for some reason was never released on a regular Beatles album(it was the B-side of the “Help” single). John seems to be his old self, mugging and delivering gobbledigook asides and Paul is always the consummate showman. George is the musician, making sure he doesn’t miss a single guitar note and Ringo is driving the beat and shaking his hair. They alone were in the eye of the hurricane, but the film does seem to capture what it must have been like. Howard’s title for his film is appropriate, for it really was “8 Days a Week.” As I said, the DVD will be released later this fall with some interesting extras. But I would recommend, if you can, going to see this film still in the movie theater, and getting that feeling of enjoying it with other fans, which is what the best of Beatlemania was all about.\n\nStuart Sutcliffe was born on June 23, 1940. He was one of the original 5 Beatles who went to Hamburg and was John Lennon’s close friend and a big artistic influence. There have been many myths built up over the years about Stu’s bass playing, as with Pete Best’s drumming, that they both weren’t that good and that’s one of the main reasons Stu left and Pete was later let go. But several Liverpool people who knew them and witnessed their playing, dispute these myths (including Bill Harry, Editor of Mersey Beat Newspaper, and who had introduced John to Stu at their Liverpool art school). Bill Harry says “the photo floating around in which Stu’s back is turned to the audience was taken during a tune up session. It’s pointed out that none of the Beatles were accomplished musicians at that time, that George Harrison wrote Stu after he left asking him to ‘please come back’, It is suggested that he actually was a good bass player, certainly not bad, and his reason for leaving the band was something other than his musical abilities.” They and others have also said that there was competition between Paul and Stu for John’s friendship. Pete Best says: “When we came back from Germany I was playing using my bass drum very loud and laying down a very solid beat. This was unheard of at the time in Liverpool as all the groups were playing the Shadows’ style. Even Ringo in Rory Storm’s group copied our beat and it wasn’t long before most drummers in Liverpool were playing the same style. This way of drumming had a great deal to do with the big sound we were producing.” This beat was referred to as “The Atom Beat”. Pete was actually the most popular Beatle in Liverpool and called, “ Mean, Moody, Magnificent” Pete and when they played the Cavern with new drummer , Ringo, George got a black eye from some of the fans. Cynthia Lennon told me she thought Pete just couldn’t compete with John and Paul’s egos: he was too nice.\n\nStu was also a talented painter who left The Beatles right before their success to pursue art and stay with his German girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr. .Astrid, an art student and photographer, would also have a huge effect on The Beatles who posed for her iconic black and white photos and encouraged them to change to their later famous Beatles haircuts and helped create their whole image. Stu would die soon after of a brain hemorrhage at only age 21.\n\nI was fortunate to meet Stu sister, Pauline and to see some of Stu’s paintings and artwork at an exhibit in Toronto in ’95. I had actually talked on the phone to her before that, because when I met Cynthia Lennon and May Pang at the Conn. Beatles Convention the year before, when I returned there was a call from her (I assume Cynthia. had given her my number, because I had mentioned to her that I planned to put on my own more artistic Beatles Conventions), which I did. I was also to meet several from their beginnings including one of the Quarrymen, who was there the day John met Paul on July 6, 1957, Allan Williams who had sent them to Hamburg, Tony Sheridan, who they backed up in Germany and first recorded with, Pete Best who was guest at my 1st Convention, Louise Harrison, George’s sister, guest at my 2nd. B. Wooler Epstein’s assistant, and others. When I met these and others who were there, since I was especially interested in this period, I would ask their opinions on these and other Beatles’ stories. Pauline Sutcliffe would also co-write the book, Backbeat, which was the basis for the film of the same name, which told of their fascinating time in Hamburg and Stu’s short but productive life. Stu would pass away on April, 10, 1962. Ironically, The Beatles would officially break-up on April, 10, 1970, exactly 8 years later to the day.\n\n“BACKBEAT FILM: HAMBURG BEATLES & INSIDE STORIES.” : https://beatlely.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/backbeat-film-hamburg-beatles-inside-stories/\n\nInterviews about Stu with: Astrid Kirchherr (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39qqW7z8dAk), and a Liverpool musician (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpzUOxmY7g).\n\nRINGO RECOGNIZED: The Still Down-To-Earth STARR\n\nBy Alan Chrisman (All Articles ARE written BY ALAN CHRISMAN), copyright 2012-2015.( a Praveen Patel has tried to hack them and claim them.)\n\nRingo was inducted into The Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame by Paul McCartney on April 18, 2015. He was the fourth Beatle to be recognized there as his own solo artist, besides the Beatles as a group.\n\nRingo always was portrayed as the “everyman” in the group, often overshadowed by the giant song writing talents of John and Paul and later, George Harrison. Lennon-McCartney tailored certain songs just for Ringo to sing on Beatles’ albums like “Help from My Friends” and “Yellow Submarine.” Otherwise, he mainly sang covers of his favorite country heroes like “Act Naturally.”\n\nBut Ringo was the consistent drummer on all their albums. Ringo had replaced Pete Best just after they had gotten their record deal in 1962. Producer George Martin, as was common in those days, hired a session drummer to fill in for Ringo on the Beatles’ first single, “Love Me Do.” Ringo had actually been in a more popular Liverpool group than The Beatles at the time, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes, but he had sometimes played together with the Beatles when they were both in Hamburg. But Ringo was always much more than just a drummer while in The Beatles, for he was an integral part of that mysterious chemistry that made the Beatles, uniquely, The Beatles. And he had that same kind of off-the-wall humor. Someone said once they were like a four-way marriage with all their personalities and talents plugged into each other. And Ringo always seemed to be the “grounder.” He not only kept the beat grounded, but sometimes the members’ egos too.\n\nWhen the Beatles split in 1970, many wondered about his solo future. He had only written a couple Beatles’ songs, “Don’t Pass Me By” and “Octopus’ Garden.” So it was to everyone’s surprise when he was to have one of the most successful ex-Beatles’ solo’s albums with his Ringo album in 1973, with several big hits including the George Harrison co-written song ,“Photograph.” He would go on to have seven Top Ten hits like, “It Don’t Come Easy”, “Back Off Boogaloo “, “ You’re Sixteen”, “Only You’, etc. Even when the other ex- Beatles sometimes were still not talking with each other much , they would still continue to appear on his albums and he theirs.\n\nThen in the 80’s & 90’s, he put together his own of several All-Starr Bands with well-known musicians who hit the road playing their hits and his. Ringo has continued to release albums over the years. And he has actually turned into a pretty good co-writer and songwriter himself. Particularly with albums like his 2008, album, Liverpool 8, it was noticeable his growing skill in that area too. Also with that album and song, he has been writing songs looking back at his Liverpool beginnings. Ringo has continued this on his new recently released album, Postcards from Paradise, with a song called “Rory & the Hurricanes.” It is Ringo’s 18th album.\n\nHe also has appeared in several films as well: Magic Christian Music, Candy, Caveman (where on set, he met his current wife, Barbara Bach, in 1981). I think his best role is in That’ll Be the Day, where he plays a working-class carny at a holiday camp (similar to the ones Ringo’s band, Rory Storm, would have actually played). It perfectly captures early 60’s England just before The Beatles hit. He is also an accomplished photographer and shot the covers for his friend, Marc Bolan’s T-Rex albums and directed a film on him. Quite a career and life for a sickly, poor, relatively-uneducated lad named “Richie” Starkey, who only picked up drumming banging on biscuit tins with sticks in the beginning! Ringo said he had just hoped to make enough as a Beatle to maybe open a hair dressing shop.\n\nLike has also been leveled at Pete Best (Cynthia Lennon told me, shy Pete didn’t have the ego to compete with John and Paul’s), over the years, some have even accused Ringo of not being the best drummer. Ringo himself has never claimed to be a trained drummer. But several other respected drummers have disagreed, crediting him with developing a whole “Ringo” sound, which many have copied. At one point during the making of The White Album, Ringo felt left-out and walked away from the sessions, but came back when the other Beatles sent him a postcard which said “You Are the Greatest Drummer in the World- Really.” Others have said he was just lucky to have been there at the right time. Paul McCartney has said they wouldn’t have stayed with Ringo, if they didn’t believe he was a good drummer. It’s hard, indeed, to imagine those Beatles’ songs without his distinctive back-beat rhythms.\n\nBelow Beatles’ postcard to Ringo asking him to return to The Beatles & Ringo’s iconic drum set on display at the R’n’R Hall Of Fame:\n\nJohn Lennon said: “Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met. Ringo was a professional drummer who sang and performed and was in one of the top groups in Britain, but especially in Liverpool. So Ringo’s talent would have come out one way or the other … whatever that spark is, in Ringo, we all know it but can’t put our finger on it. Whether it’s acting, drumming, or singing, I don’t know. There’s something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced as an individual … Ringo is a damn good drummer.”\n\nThe Beatles were more than just the sum of their parts. Ringo was and is much more than just a drummer, who happened to play in the best band in the world. He has his own personality and persona and talents and loyal following. Ringo still seems to be that same down-to-earth star that’s such a rarity these days, especially, with whom we can all still relate.\n\nWhen McCartney and rock royalty induct Ringo into the Hall of Fame, it will be time and well-deserved. Paul and he are now receiving all kinds of accolades and still carrying on their great legacy and still performing.\n\nRingo has announced another tour starting in October with his All-Starr band line-up of the last 12 years to support his new album, Postcards from Paradise. I met his 1995 All-Starr band including Billy Preston, Randy Bachman (The Guess Who and BTO), and Felix Cavaliere (The Rascals). I’m very happy I was able to get tickets for his new show in October in Montreal, where I also saw Paul in ‘89 and George in ’74. I also saw Paul in Ottawa in 2013. We should still see these living legends while we still can, as they continue to put on great shows. Some things which are good, never change. And Ringo, as I said, is like that, or as he would say, like “Peace & Love” too. The Hall of Fame ceremony will be broadcast on HBO May 30.\n\nRingo doing his rocker, “Rory & the Hurricanes” about his beginnings, from his new album, Postcards from Paradise:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HPjQcqRsqBQ\n\nRingo on his new album and tour:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uGdhtLV8c50\n\nFREDA KELLY: THE BEATLES’ SECRETARY & FAN CLUB HEAD\n\nBy Alan Chrisman (All Articles ARE written BY ALAN CHRISMAN), copyright 2012-2015.( a Praveen Patel has tried to hack them and claim them.)\n\nI just saw a documentary on Freda Kelly, The Beatles’ secretary and who was in charge of their official fan club. The film is named “Good Ol’ Freda” after a shout-out The Beatles’ make about her in their 1962 Xmas’ message.\n\nI thought it would be interesting, as she was one of the few who were there at their very beginnings. And it is, as she relates many everyday stories about them. She worked with them for 11 years, from 1961 on. She had been working in a typing pool and was a regular at The Cavern. Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein, approached the seventeen-year-old to come help him deal with the growing workload at his NEMS Liverpool record store and help with his new band, The Beatles.\n\nBesides her regular office work for Brian, a lot of her duties consisted of answering the, at first, a few letters a day to later thousands in big mailbags, from their increasing numbers of fans. Out of that grew her starting their first official Beatles’ Fan Club and newsletter and Beatles’ Monthly Magazine. She saw The Beatles’ often as they would drop in to Epstein’s office and got to know each well. They would have cups of tea and autograph the rising pile of fan letters requesting signed photos, snippets of hair and clothing. Freda also often had to go around and visit the Beatles’ homes after her already long hours at work to get them to sign more photos or papers, and she got to know all their families well. Ringo’s mom, she became especially close to, as her own mother had died when she was only 18 months old and was raised by a father, who saw no future in her working for a pop group.\n\nAll these stories and descriptions of The Beatles and the people around them are fascinating enough, but what really makes the film is Freda herself. She’s a very interesting person. While many others around the Beatles have exploited their connections to them, she never did. She calls herself a very private person and always wanted to respect their privacy too. She had even told little of her Beatles’ involvement to her own family and friends. She had given away most of the leftover Fan Club photos, magazines, etc. to fans with whom she identified and felt committed to, as she had been originally just a fan herself. At one point in the film, she goes into her attic and rummages through the last few boxes of Beatles’ material she has kept. She still feels a fierce loyalty to them and their story. After The Beatles broke up in 1970, she got another job as a private secretary and she is still working and living in Liverpool. She only agreed to tell her story (for the one and only time, she says) when her daughter finally persuaded her and for her grandchild, when approached by the filmmaker nephew of another Liverpool friend and band at the time, The Merseybeats. That’s the kind of person, Freda Kelly is, still not anxious to tell secrets on her old friends and bosses.\n\nI, as I’ve said, have been fortunate to meet several people who knew The Beatles. I’ve written about several of these and others around them, as well as a series of recent tributes to Neil Aspinall, Tony Sheridan, and Cynthia Lennon (who passed away, Apr. 1st). Some have written books, appeared at Beatles’ Conventions, and been in documentaries. The Beatles are, of course, Rock Royalty now, but some behind-the scenes people, like Freda Kelly, haven’t gotten much recognition. Few around them became became rich or famous. Some have even preferred to remain mainly private: Astrid Kirchherr (who created their “look”), Bob Wooler (Cavern DJ), Tony Sheridan). I have found very interesting stories about The Beatles through theirs and others’ eyes and stories like Pete Shotten’s (Quarrymen and Lennon’s childhood friend), Derek Taylor and Tony Barrow Beatles’ publicists), etc. But as Freda Kelly breaks down near the end of the film and says, not many of them are still here anymore. What struck me about most, if not all, the people whom I met who knew The Beatles’ at their beginnings, is their reverence for The Beatles and what they experienced. That and their remarkable down–to-earthness, which must reflect their often Liverpool humble roots. Freda Kelly comes across like you could just drop in for a cup of tea, as she often had with The Beatles.\n\nTrailor for film, “Good Ol’ Freda”:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LqO3DIaKTXM\n\nComplete film Dvd available:\n\nhttp://www.magpictures.com/goodolfreda/\n\nA TRIBUTE TO CYNTHIA LENNON & MEETING HER\n\nBy Alan Chrisman, copyright.\n\nCynthia Lennon, John’s 1st. wife, passed away April 1, 2015 at the age of 75 after a battle with cancer. I’d always wanted to meet her and in 1994, I got my wish. Someone had told me of a Beatles’ Convention in Stamford , Connecticut and she was one of the main guests.\n\nI had never been to a Beatles’ Convention before, but my fellow student and friend, Al Whyte, and I had just completed a course about putting on events and our two’s school project (only a fantasy) had been to do a Beatles’ Convention. So we had a chance to actually go to one and also meet, as I say, John Lennon’s wife. I had read her book, Twist of Lennon, and could picture what it must have been like before they were very well-known in those early Beatles’ days in Liverpool.\n\nAl and I met her briefly and she was even nicer and lovely than I had hoped. She signed my copy of her book and I nervously asked her some questions. I’d always wanted to see if I could try and see what John had been like past the pop star and media images. We also ran into her later coming down in the elevator of the hotel where the Convention was being held. She had long blonde hair and wore wire-rimmed glasses like John.\n\nI had read the romantic story in her book about how John had met her at their Liverpool art school in 1958. But they were complete opposites. John was the angry, chip-on his shoulder rebel, especially because his mother had been killed by a drunken driver when John was still a teenager. Cynthia Powell was the more middle-class “nice girl”. But what they had in common was both of them being near-sighted and their love of art. But she was able to detect underneath the Lennon sneer, a softer side too. They would sneak over to John’s aspiring-painter friend, Stu Sutcliffe’s room to make love.\n\nCynthia was very supportive of John and his early budding Beatles’ band. And when Paul, George, Pete Best, and Stu Sutcliffe were sent to Hamburg, John would write back regular funny postcards and letters to her (even though they were playing in some of most decadent bars and temptations in Europe). When they returned from Germany and first played the Cavern, she was there too. But Cynthia didn’t have it easy. She was renting a room from John’s sometimes stern Aunt Mimi, while working at Woolworths and the two women didn’t get along. She then moved to a small bedsitter room.\n\nWhen Cynthia became pregnant with their son, Julian, they got married in 1962. (John said later, “it had been the thing to do”). Even as The Beatles were becoming more and more popular, Cynthia was still stuck alone while The Beatles were on tour, having to put up with her husband being away a lot of the time, and with all the girls throwing themselves at the young men. And Lennon would sometimes take his frustrations out on her, violently even. There’s a scene in The film, Backbeat about the Hamburg days, where Astrid Kirchherr, the German art student who basically created the whole Beatles’ “look” says to Cynthia’s character, ”but John wants the world.”\n\nAt their height, as The Beatles were experimenting with drugs, Cynthia never really felt comfortable with their excesses. Beatle wives were rarely allowed to be in the studio when their husbands were at work. When their manager, Brian Epstein died, they all went to India to see the Maharishi, but John was secretly writing to this new artist, Yoko Ono. On the plane home, he admitted to his wife the many affairs he’d had. John advised her to go to Greece for a vacation, the day she returned, she discovered Yoko had spent the night with him at her home. Lennon and Cynthia soon divorced in 1968.\n\nJohn had remarried Yoko but Julian had been pretty well ignored by his father ( much as John himself has been deserted by his father). It wasn’t until Yoko and John had separated for several months in 1973 and John was with May Pang in L.A. that May encouraged John to re-connect with Julian. Interestingly, I also met May Pang at that same Conn. Convention. I was surprised she was there; she wasn’t a scheduled guest. But I soon learned she was good friends with Cynthia and had come in to see her. I was able to meet May Pang too and get her to sign my copy of Lennon’s Walls and Bridges album and get photos of her too.\n\n.Al and I were so inspired by meeting Cynthia and May Pang and others at that Conn. Convention that we decided to actually put on our own Beatles’ Conventions. Also, soon after I got back home, Stu Sutcliffe’s sister, Pauline called me from England (I think Cynthia must have given Pauline my number). We had presented Cynthia with our “fantasy”. She seemed interested in our more ‘artistic’ convention than they usually were. Cynthia was an artist in her own right and she would later have exhibitions of some of her art. Cynthia Lennon’s own artwork of The Cavern. Cynthia’s own drawing of The Cavern.\n\nWe even thought of having her son, Julian, whom had had a successful album, Valotte, as a guest too (which she liked). Unfortunately, she couldn’t make it, but we did end up doing our Ottawa Conventions in ‘95 and ’96, with Pete Best and Louise Harrison as main guests, respectively. Cynthia Lennon would later write a second book simply called John in 2005. She was a lot more critical of John in that book than her first and even said she wished in some ways, she had never met him. Cynthia would, for years, have trouble getting much money and ran a couple failed restaurants and two of her marriages had ended in divorce before her final third husband died in 2013. When Yoko inherited John’s estate when John was killed in 1980, it still took years until Julian finally got a settlement which he shared with his mother. Julian has been bitter the way he felt he had been treated, but over time, all the Beatles’ wives and children finally did appear together at certain functions such as the premiere of Cirque de Soleil’s Beatles’ Love show.\n\nCynthia, despite having been married to one of the most famous people in the world, as I said, didn’t have it easy. But I was honored to meet her. I have no doubt that if Al and I hadn’t met Cynthia, we would never have actually done our own Beatles’ Conventions and gone on to meet several who knew The Beatles. That’s how much this lovely lady, Cynthia Lennon, had inspired me.\n\nBelow Julian Lennon’s video tribute to his mother, Cynthia, with his song:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fsyYqJxf9Qk\n\nTribute to Neil Aspinall: The Beatles’ Guardian Angel by Alan Chrisman, copyright.\n\nNo one was more trusted by The Beatles than Neil Aspinall( who died on Mar. 24, 2008). . He was director of their Apple Records for 30 years after Brian Epstein and Allan Klein. He had started out in Liverpool at their very beginnings, driving them around in his van to their early shows and was their road manager. He had been in the same class as Paul McCartney and knew George Harrison at Liverpool Institute and met John Lennon attending his first term at the Liverpool College of Art next door.\n\nHe became very good friends with Pete Best, original Beatles’ drummer and stayed at his house, where the Beatles first played Pete’s mother’s club, The Casbah, before The Cavern. And when The Beatles replaced Best with Ringo, Pete advised him to continue working with The Beatles, despite their close friendship.\n\nAspinall traveled with them to America and when George became sick, he stood in for him at rehearsals for the Ed Sullivan Show. He would also accompany them to promote the founding of their Apple Corp. in 1968. It was his idea to have a Sgt. Pepper as the narrator of their land-breaking album. He also participated in the recording of “For The Benefit of Mr. Kite”, “Within You, Without You”, on “Magical Mystery Tour” and “Yellow Submarine.”\n\nNeil Aspinall’s Van in which he drove early Beatles (including above, Pete Best) to their shows, outside The Cavern.\n\nBut his main role besides being their personal assistant along with Mal Evans, was their confidant and protector. When Klein tried to “clean house” to save money at Apple and even let go of Aspinall, all the Beatles came to his rescue. After Klein and The Beatles parted ways, Aspinall, who was trained as an accountant, was asked by them to take over the running of Apple. Even during this period when The Beatles had split up and were suing each other, he was always able to maintain an impartiality with each of them, which couldn’t have been easy at times. He would be instrumental in fighting for several lawsuits for them against Apple Computers and their EMI Record Company.\n\nIt was Neil Aspinall’s idea for the later very successful Beatles’ Anthologies in the early 90’s. He had started working on compiling their official history as early as 1970 under the original title, “The Long and Winding Road.”\n\nAlthough he had many lucrative offers to reveal inside secrets about The Beatles, he never did, maintaining their loyalty and trust until his death of lung cancer in 2008 (like George Harrison, whom he had first met sharing smokes behind a schoolyard shed).\n\nA couple things which some people may not know: While Neil Aspinall was staying at Pete Best’s place, the 19 year-old had a relationship with Pete’s mother, who ran The Casbah. The result was the birth of Roag Best, Pete’s half-brother . Pete and his brother, Roag, were musical guests at 1st. first Ottawa Beatles Convention which I organized in 1995. It was there where I learned of this, for a long time, little-known connection between the two and this was during the release of the 1st Beatles Anthology. By the next year, when Pete came back to play during my second Convention week, Pete had become a millionaire “overnight” (30 years having been dismissed by The Beatles, with no explanation), because he was on several songs on the Anthology. I’ve always wondered if Neil Aspinall hadn’t had something to do with Pete finally getting his due, since it had been his idea, as I said, for The Anthologies. It wouldn’t surprise me a bit, as Aspinall seemed to always strive for fairness for everyone.\n\nPete Best Band (Including Neil Aspinall’s son and Pete’s half-brother, Roag, left) were musical guests at the 1st Ottawa Beatles Convention.\n\nAnother interesting story is that my friend, Yury Pelyushonok, actually got to know Neil Aspinall a bit. Neil had taken a liking to my Russ. Cdn. friend, Yury Pelyushonok and Yury’s book, Strings for A Beatle Bass, about how The Beatles helped bring down communism and Yury had been to see Aspinall in London at Apple headquarters a few times. This is an excerpt from my previous blog about how that originally came about: “Yury was going to London, in April, 2000, and I suggested he leave a copy of his book with the Beatles’ manager, Neil Aspinall (the BBC lady had given me his contact at the Connecticut convention in’94, because I had alerted her about a dealer that was trying to sell a rare BBC film, which she got back). Yury did leave a book there and upon returning, he called me one morning and said he’d had a dream, that Neil Aspinall had called me. I’d always wanted to meet Aspinall because he had been there since the beginning and was their closest confidant. And the very next day Yury calls me back and says, “Guess who just called?” I said “Who?” He says, “Paul McCartney’s personal assistant, Geoff Baker!”\n\nThe Beatles’ record company, Apple, would also later call back for more copies for George and Ringo. Yury went back to the Beatles’ headquarters a couple more times to discuss the possibility they would publish his book. Neil Aspinall told him in advance that Paul McCartney was to play in Red Square in May, 2003; it was to be a world event. Yury had taken a lot of flak for suggesting that the Beatles could have helped bring down Communism. But Yury was interviewed in N.Y. on ABC- TV “BEATLES REVOLUTION” in 2000 with several celebrities who agreed, including Czech director Milos Forman and Keith Richards (“What brought it down, in the end, was blues jeans and Rock N’ Roll”). And there was soon to be growing evidence that what Yury had first said, was indeed true.\n\nYury Pelyushonok’s book above, about how Beatles helped bring down communism.\n\nYury’s book and experiences were to partly inspire BBC film director, Leslie Woodhead’s film, HOW THE BEATLES ROCKED THE KREMLIN. Finally in 2009, the film was completed and shown on PBS in the States and CBC in Canada, in conjunction with the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall in ’89. The film and idea got write-ups in the L.A. Times, Toronto Globe and Mail, etc. Yury was interviewed again by the Ottawa Citizen. And the film has since been repeated several times on both PBS and the CBC. In 2013, Mr. Woodhead released a book of the same title, chronicling the making of his film, including a whole chapter on Yury and the visit to Ottawa in 2007 (including about the day we shot the video and both Tony Copple of The Ottawa Beatles Site and I, are described in it) to film an interview with Yury and the video shooting of his song, “Yeah Yeah Virus”. It is used as a theme throughout the film. Yury had also told me about a call he received from Aspinall around the time of the premiere of The Beatles’ Love show and by Cirque du Soleil in 2006. Aspinall put on the phone briefly an oriental woman (Yoko?), as Aspinall was still working on helping Yury get his book known up until close to his death. As I said, he seemed to have taken a liking to my friend, Yury, and that was the kind of gentleman, Aspinall was.\n\nIt was my friend, Yury, above with Neil Aspinall at The Beatles’ Apple Corp. London, which first described him as The Beatles’ Earthly Guardian Angel.\n\nBelow video of those special few, including Neil Aspinall, who helped The Beatles, behind the scenes:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pBh47-WOk3Q"
