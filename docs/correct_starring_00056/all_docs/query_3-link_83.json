        "text": "McCartney, 81, will appear alongside singing legends Elton John and Garth Brooks in the follow up to the 1984 comedy movie.\n\nThe original film followed members of the fictional heavy metal group Spinal Tap – dubbed “one of England’s loudest bands”.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, Director Rob Reiner, who made the first movie, says he is making a sequel featuring a host of stars.\n\nHe revealed Beatles icon Paul McCartney has a role during a chat on Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre podcast.\n\nStars of the original hit flick Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest will also return.\n\nReiner said: “We’re making a sequel. We’re going to start shooting at the end of February.\n\n“Everybody is back, Paul McCartney is joining and Elton John, and a few other surprises, Garth Brooks.”\n\nDiscussing the success of the first film, he said: “The only thing that matters is getting people that are good at improvising. You have to get people who feel comfortable doing that.”\n\nThe plot of Spinal Tap will centre on the death of the fictional British band’s manager and his wife who then inherits a contract that requires them to do one last concert.\n\nThere’s bad blood and anger towards Reiner’s filmmaker Martin “Marty” Di Bergi who they feel did a hatchet job with the original documentary, but returns to film their final hurrah.\n\nWhile the original movie was met with critical acclaim, it wasn’t an initial hit commercially, later finding an audience on VHS instead.\n\nReiner has said that initially, viewers were confused.\n\n“The first time we screened in Dallas, they didn’t know what the hell it was,” he explained.\n\n“People came up to me and said, I don’t understand why would you make a movie about a band no one has heard of and is so bad. Why would you do it?\n\n“I said, it’s satire and I would explain, but it took a while for people to catch up to it. Now, it’s in the National Film Registry.”\n\nReiner went on: “I can tell you hardly a day goes by without someone saying, why don’t you do another one?”\n\n“For so many years, we said, ‘nah.’ It wasn’t until we came up with the right idea how to do this. You don’t want to just do it, to do it. You want to honour the first one and push it a little further with the story.”\n\nThe new movie is set for release in two years’ time to coincide with the 1984 original’s 40th anniversary.\n\nEarlier this year the fictional band’s drummer Ric Parnell, who later toured with them in real life, died aged 70."
