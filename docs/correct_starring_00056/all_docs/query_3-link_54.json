        "text": "Publish date: 2024-06-13\n\nIn an exclusive Screen Rant interview, Yesterday director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Richard Curtis discuss why Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr donât have cameos. â¦ While speaking with Screen Rantâs Alex Leadbeater, Yesterdayâs director and screenwriter revealed why the two surviving Beatles donât have cameos.\n\nAlso, Is Julian Lennon in the movie Yesterday?\n\nYesterdayâs big cameo features a 78-year-old Lennon, a man who accepts a strange guest at his seaside home. His appearance affects Jack in a profound way, and thematically calls back to the first act inciting incident: the bus accident. Jack is led to Lennon by two loyal fans.\n\nAccordingly, Does Himesh Patel really sing in Yesterday?\n\nIn the case of Yesterday, the Beatles-centric jukebox musical film, the answer is a resounding âyes.â Star Himesh Patel, who plays a struggling singer-songwriter who somehow is the only person on Earth who remembers the Beatles, does all his own singing in the movie.\n\nin the same way Where is John Lennonâs house in Yesterday?\n\nWho played John Lennon? Toward the final act, Jack travels to a faraway house (shot on Shingle Street in Suffolk) to visit an old man. It turns out to be John Lennon, who, in this alternate timeline, became an old man living a modest, peaceful life.\n\nDid Himesh Patel really lose his teeth?\n\nItâs all movie magic, of course! Although theyâre soon fixed in the film, the altered appearance of his teeth was done courtesy of the excellent Fangs FX.
