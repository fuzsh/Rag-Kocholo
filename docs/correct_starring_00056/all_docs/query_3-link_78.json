        "text": "It may be hard to believe, but Sir Paul McCartney, one of two surviving members of The Beatles and arguably the game-changing foursome’s most successful solo graduate, is the only Beatle who doesn’t have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nThe 69-year-old has certainly seen his share of nominations over the years, and even participated in honoring two of his bandmates, Ringo Starr in 2010 and George Harrison in 2009, eight years after the guitarist died in 2001 — both stars, along with John Lennon’s and one for The Beatles, have a permanent home in Hollywood outside the Capitol Records building near Hollywood and Vine — but the dedication ceremony has eluded him, mostly due to scheduling difficulties.\n\nSTORY: Rihanna, Coldplay and Paul McCartney to Perform on Grammy Awards\n\nThe unintended slight is about to change.\n\nOn Feb. 9, nearly 20 years after last being chosen for the honor in 1993, he’ll finally get that star. Details on guest attendees and speakers have yet to be revealed, but the ceremony will take place at 2 p.m. outside of Capitol Records. The next night, the Beatle will be honored as Musicares’ Person of the Year at the organization’s annual gala dinner and tribute concert.\n\nIt’s all part of a grand celebration of music leading up to the Grammy Awards, broadcast live on CBS from the L.A’s Staples Center Sunday, Feb. 12."
