        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n28 Nov 2023, 08:41\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nOne of the all-time greatest comedy mockumentaries is getting a long-awaited sequel, and it’s got some big names lined up.\n\nClassic 1984 documentary-style film, This Is Spinal Tap, is a regular on all-time top movies lists, with its tale of a fictional ailing British rock-metal band’s disastrous US tour. Directed by Rob Reiner, it stars US actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean from Better Call Saul and The Simpsons’ Harry Shearer as English musicians in the band Spinal Tap.\n\nNow, Reiner has revealed that actual, real-life British music legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John are set to appear in the upcoming sequel, and that US country singer-songwriter Garth Brooks will also feature.\n\nSpeaking on Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, the filmmaker said: “We’re going to start shooting in the end of February. Everybody’s back. Paul McCartney is joining us, and Elton John. And a few other surprises... Garth Brooks.”\n\nJust as he did in the original film, Reiner will appear as Marty DiBergi, as well as directing the movie. And, as you would expect, McKean, Guest and Shearer will all return as David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel and Derek Smalls.\n\nThe 1984 film, which was largely improvised, contains several moments that have gone down in movie folklore, including quotable moments such as guitarist Nigel telling Marty how his amps “go to eleven” because, “it’s one louder, isn’t it? It’s not ten.”.\n\nOther highlights include the band being second on the bill to a puppet show, confusion regarding a replica of Stonehenge, and some bizarre reasons the band have to keep replacing their drummers.\n\nThe sequel to This Is Spinal Tap was due to land in March 2024, in order to coincide with the original film’s 40th anniversary. However with Reiner announcing that filming is set to begin in February, this release date will need to be revised. There is no news on when the film will be out."
