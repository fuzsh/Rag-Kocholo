        "text": "Sir Paul McCartney has joined a host of celebrities to pay tribute to the actor Victor Spinetti, who has died at the age of 82.\n\nBorn to an Italian-Welsh father and Welsh mother in Cwm, Ebbw Vale, Spinetti was a regular performer in London's West End as well as with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nHe appeared in more than 30 films, including three Beatles movies.\n\nSir Paul spoke about Spinetti's \"wit and exuberant personality\".\n\nThe former Beatle struck up a friendship with the Welshman during filming for the first Beatles film, A Hard Day's Night.\n\n\"Victor was a fine man, a great pal and a fantastic actor and someone I am proud to have known for many years,\" said Sir Paul.\n\n\"His irreverent wit and exuberant personality will remain in my memory forever.\n\n\"I will miss his loyal friendship, as will all the others who were lucky enough to know and love the wonderful Mr Spinetti.\"\n\nSpinetti died at a hospice in Monmouth on Monday morning, said his agent Barry Burnett.\n\n\"He had cancer for a year, but he was very cheerful to the end,\" said Mr Burnett.\n\n\"I spoke to him on Friday and he was talking about his plans and everything.\"\n\nNews of his death prompted a stream of tributes from fans and members of the entertainment world on Twitter.\n\nBarbara Windsor, a lifelong friend and co-star in Oh! What a Lovely War, had visited Spinetti last Thursday.\n\n\"We were very close. He was another of my great friends from that era. He was such a great man,\" she said.\n\n\"We just chatted and chatted and talked about old things. But he said, 'let's not talk about all that, let's talk about the future'.\"\n\nActor Rob Brydon tweeted: \"So sad Victor Spinetti has died. The funniest story teller I've ever met and a lovely warm man. Proud to have been his friend. 'Eh, Vic...'\"\n\nBritt Ekland, actor, wrote: \"Just heard my wonderful friend, co writer and director Victor Spinetti died. Am devastated to have lost a true acting genius.\"\n\nWelsh actor Sian Phillips told BBC Wales she was shocked and saddened, adding: \"He was such a force of joy and vitality. When one saw him across a crowded room, one couldn't wait to get together with him and have a chat and a catch-up.\""
