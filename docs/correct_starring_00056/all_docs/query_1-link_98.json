        "text": "Paul McCartney is writing a musical version of the classic Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, who rose to international fame with the Beatles, has joined forces with Lee Hall (Billy Elliot: The Musical), who is penning the libretto and co-writing the lyrics with McCartney. Bill Kenwright will produce.\n\nMcCartney, who has already written more than 10 songs for the project, said in a statement, “Writing a musical is not something that had ever really appealed to me. But Bill and I met up with Lee Hall and had a chat, and I found myself thinking this could be interesting and fun.”\n\nNo timeline has been officially announced for a stage production, although a 2020 U.K. premiere would likely precede a Broadway staging.\n\nSEE WHAT ELSE IS SCHEDULED TO PERFORM IN LONDON\n\nThe 1946 film starred James Stewart as George Bailey with Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H.B. Warner, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Samuel S. Hinds, Mary Treen, and Virginia Patton. The movie earned five Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture."
