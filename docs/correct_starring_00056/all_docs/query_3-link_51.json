        "text": "Sir James Paul McCartney (born June 18, 1942), better known as Paul McCartney, is an English singer, songwriter, and musician who gained worldwide fame as co-lead vocalist, co-songwriter, and bassist for The Beatles. After the Beatles split up in 1970, McCartney pursued his own successful solo career, recording with a variety of artists, including his group ‘Wings’. One of the most successful composers and performers of all time, he is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism, exploring styles ranging from pre-rock 'n' roll pop to classical and electronica. Paul McCartney portrayed Uncle Jack in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPirates of the Caribbean[]\n\nPaul McCartney portrayed Uncle Jack for the fifth film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. The character was named after McCartney's own uncle, John \"Jack\" McCartney.[1][2] According to directors Rønning and Sandberg, Paul McCartney's character Uncle Jack takes the role that would have been filled by Keith Richards as Captain Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague. However, when Richards was unavailable, reportedly because of scheduling issues, the directing duo brainstormed with Johnny Depp, believing they should \"honour the tradition of showing a Jack Sparrow family member.\" Depp texted Paul McCartney, who agreed to appear in the film.[3] But due to his demanding schedule during the main shoot of the film in Australia, McCartney wasn't free to make it happen until the Vancouver shoot.[4] Screenwriter Jeff Nathanson created an appropriate scene for Depp and McCartney, to which the duo then added their own very particular and personal spin.[2]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales - Uncle Jack\n\nTrivia[]\n\nPaul McCartney portrayed \"Uncle Jack\" in Dead Men Tell No Tales. Having previously been rumored to appear as a jail guard, McCartney was listed as \"Jail Guard #2\" on IMDB. Even after the film's release, as of 2023, such information was still written on the the official Disney D23 website.[5]\n\n[]\n\nPaul McCartney on Wikipedia\n\nPaul McCartney at the Internet Movie Database"
