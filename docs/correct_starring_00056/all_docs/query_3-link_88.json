        "text": "His career has spanned more than 60 years!\n\nSir Paul McCartney has had quite the career, spanning more than 60 years and earning him 18 Grammys, and a knighthood along the way. While known to many as the bass player and singer-songwriter in The Beatles, Sir Paul has also enjoyed success as part of Wings and as a solo artist.\n\nThanks to his amazing talents as a songwriter and musician, Paul composed dozens of hit songs including 'Hey Jude' and 'Let it Be', which continue to have multi-generational appeal. From his time in The Beatles and Wings to going it alone as a solo artist, here’s everything you need to know about Paul McCartney and his amazing career. This year, the musician was reunited with a bass guitar which was stolen more than 50 years ago, released a previously unreleased live album called 'One Hand Clapping'.\n\nWhere was Paul McCartney born?\n\nPaul McCartney was born in Liverpool, England on 18th June 1942.\n\nHow old is he?\n\nPaul McCartney turned 82-years-old in 2024.\n\nHe celebrated his 81st birthday on Father's Day in 2023, sharing a photo of himself in front of Cliveden House in Berkshire which is where The Beatles filmed their 1965 movie Help!.\n\nBack in 2022, he celebrated his 80th by performing with Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi as part of his US 'Got Back' tour.\n\nWatch Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen perform 'Glory Days' and 'I Wanna Be Your Man':\n\nPaul McCartney's career with The Beatles\n\nThe Beatles, which consisted of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, shot to fame in 1963 after releasing their first single in the UK, 'Love Me Do'. But it wasn’t until they toured the US in 1964 that they truly reached international stardom. According to Official Charts Company, The Beatles went on to have 18 Number 1 singles in the UK (their 18th being 'Now And Then' in 2023), they also had 16 Number 1 albums in the UK.\n\nThanks to their unique look and sound, the band captivated a younger generation of music lovers during a period of immense change. Artists such as Oasis, Black Sabbath, Lady Gaga, Nirvana and Paul Weller have all cited the band as being major influences in their work.\n\nWhen did Paul join The Beatles?\n\nOn July 6th 1957, Paul McCartney met John Lennon through a mutual friend at Woolton Village Fete when he was 15-years-old. John was performing in his skiffle band, The Quarrymen, and a few months later, Paul was invited to join. Several name changes later, The Beatles was born, along with a new rock ‘n’ roll sound.\n\nDespite only being together for eight years, The Beatles recorded a whopping 209 songs. Their biggest hit was 'She Loves You' which spent six non-consecutive weeks at Number 1 in the UK and sold 1.92 million copies worldwide. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'Can’t Buy Me Love' were also huge successes for the quartet, selling 1.78 million and 1.54 million copies respectively.\n\nWhich songs did Paul McCartney write for The Beatles?\n\nOf the 209 songs recorded by The Beatles, it’s claimed that Paul McCartney wrote 43. His most successful songs include 'Hey Jude', 'Let It Be', 'Eleanor Rigby' and 'Yesterday'. Paul also co-wrote numerous hit songs with bandmate John Lennon, including 'She Loves You' and 'I Want to Hold Your Hand'.\n\nHow was the breakup of The Beatles announced?\n\nOn 10th April 1970, Paul McCartney unintentionally announced the breakup of The Beatles. He was about to release his debut solo album 'McCartney' on the 17th April, but rather than do promotional interviews, Paul answered questions written for him by Peter Brown, an assistant at The Beatles' label, Apple Records.\n\nAlthough he did not confirm that the band had split up, his answers to this 'self-interview' press release included disparaging comments about the band and the end of his songwriting partnership with John Lennon. After its contents were revealed to the media, the band decided to cut ties for good.\n\nThe Beatles 'final' song 'Now And Then'\n\nIn June 2023, Paul McCartney revealed he has recorded the 'final' Beatles song, using AI to recreate John Lennon's voice. He explained how John's voice was isolated by Peter Jackson for the film Get Back, which was about their 1970 album 'Let It Be'.\n\n\"When we came to make what will be the last Beatles record, it was a demo that John had (and) we were able to take John’s voice and get it pure through this AI,\" Paul told the BBC.\n\n'Now And Then' was released on 2nd November 2023 as a double A side with the band's 1962 debut single 'Love Me Do'. Along with the song, a documentary was released which follows the creation of the song, dating back to the 70s when John Lennon wrote the song and recorded it on a cassette tape.\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney's friendship\n\nAside from being the most legendary songwriting duo in music history, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were also kindred spirits, meeting when they were just teenagers. The unique friendship between the pair began through a like-mindedness for music but their connection was further strengthened over the shared loss of their mothers.\n\nWhile the pair were undeniably close, there was also a brotherly sense of competitiveness between them when it came to writing songs. This eagerness to out-do each other by writing the best songs arguably helped the band to continuously produce hit after hit.\n\nDuring the promotional tour for his album, 'Egypt Station' in 2018, Paul McCartney was asked by CBS if he and John ever complimented each other’s song writing face to face. He said 'Once. Once John gave me a compliment. It was only once the whole time. It was ‘Here, There and Everywhere,’ one of my songs on 'Revolver'. John says just as it finishes, ‘That’s a really good song, lad. I love that song.’ And I’m like, ‘Yes! He likes it!’\"\n\nPaul wrote the song 'Dear Friend' about John in an attempt to reach out following the band's split. He revealed that in the song, he was: \"Talking to John after we’d had all the disputes about The Beatles break up\" and also revealed that he gets emotional listening to the song to this day.\n\nDespite their arguments following the breakup of The Beatles, the pair managed to reconcile and rebuild their friendship before John was sadly killed in 1980. In his last interview, John spoke of his friendship with Paul, saying: \"He's like a brother. I love him. Families, we certainly have our ups and downs and our quarrels, but at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, I would do anything for him, and I think he would do anything for me.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's tribute to John Lennon\n\nWhilst grieving the loss of John Lennon, Paul McCartney recorded the song 'Here Today' as a personal tribute to his friend and former Beatles bandmate. The song was included on the 1982 album 'Tug of War' and Paul often plays the song when he’s on tour, even to this day.\n\nIn 2019, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr teamed up to perform a rendition of John Lennon’s 'Grow Old with Me' for Ringo’s 2019 album, 'What’s My Name'. The last two surviving members of the Beatles said they collaborated on the song to pay tribute to John, 40 years after the singer’s untimely death.\n\nPaul recalls his last meeting with George Harrison\n\nPaul spent time with George not long before his death from cancer in 2001 and opened up about the last time he saw his bandmate: \"I sat with him for a few hours when he was in treatment just outside New York. He was about 10 days away from his death, as I recall. We joked about things - just amusing, nutty stuff.\n\n\"It was good. It was like we were dreaming. He was my little baby brother, almost, because I’d known him that long. We held hands. It’s funny, even at the height of our friendship – as guys – you would never hold hands. It just wasn’t a Liverpool thing. But it was lovely.\"\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nA documentary following The Beatles' career in 1969 and their final performance together on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building, called The Beatles: Get Back came out in November 2021 on Disney+.\n\nSince then, the rooftop concert got a cinematic release and the documentary has come out on DVD.\n\nReflecting on his favourite parts of Get Back, Paul said: \"There were quite a few smiles: me and John goofing around on ‘Two of Us’ acting like ventriloquists and singing through our teeth; me and John goofing around on ‘Bathroom Window’ where we start ringing Tuesday - \"Hello Tuesday!\" - that was nice. But the one that immediately comes to mind is John dancing - just seeing him dancing. It’s very cute, and he was actually a really good mover!'\"\n\nPaul McCartney's career with Wings\n\nWings were a British-American rock band created in 1971 by Paul McCartney, his wife Linda McCartney, drummer Denny Seiwell, and guitarist Denny Laine. The band were notorious for frequent changes to their line-up, going through three lead guitarists and four drummers in a short space of time. However, the trio of the McCartneys and Laine remained throughout.\n\nDuring the 10 years the band were together, they wrote huge hits such as 'Hi, Hi, Hi', 'Mull of Kintyre' and 'Red Rose Speedway', as well as the James Bond theme song 'Live and Let Die'. Their biggest album 'Band on the Run' spent four weeks at Number 1 in the US charts and eventually went Triple Platinum.\n\nWhich are the most successful Wings songs?\n\nThroughout their 10 years together, Wings achieved 12 Top 10 singles in the UK and 14 Top 10 singles in the US. Their song, 'Mull of Kintyre' reached Number 1 in the UK in 1977 and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. This earned the song the title of best-selling UK single in history at the time.\n\n'Jet' and 'Band on the Run' were also successful songs for Wings. 'Band on the Run' made it to Number 1 in several countries, including the US, Canada and New Zealand and sold over 1 million copies in the US alone. 'Jet' was also a Top 10 hit for Wings and Paul McCartney, peaking at Number 7 in both the US and the UK.\n\nIn 1972, Paul and Linda brought their daughters Heather, Mary and Stella on tour with them, and Paul opened up about the experience of touring with his family.\n\nExplaining the decision, Paul said: \"Our main reason was, we worried about leaving the kids at home and then getting a nanny or somebody ringing up saying, ‘Oh they’ve gone into hospital’ or ‘they’re very ill’, and we’d be far away in Australia or something.\"\n\nHe added: \"When we decided to bring them along we tried to be very careful about the sensible stuff like their education. We did things like going to their school and asking the teachers what the class are going to be doing while we’re away, and then we had a tutor that came with us - the kids hated him! They did not like being told in the afternoon that it was ‘school time!’. They’d protest: ‘No, we wanna go to the beach!’.\"\n\nHow many albums has Paul McCartney released?\n\nDuring their eight years together, The Beatles released 12 studio albums, including 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' in 1967 and 'Abbey Road' in 1969.\n\nWings released seven studio albums, one live album and two compilation albums during their time together. This included 'Wild Life', 'Band on the Run' and 'Venus and Mars'. Paul has now announced another album will be released in June, which will feature unreleased recordings from 1974. The album is called 'One Hand Clapping'.\n\nThroughout his career as a solo artist, the ex-Beatle has also released 26 studio albums, nine live albums and four compilation albums.\n\nWhat is 'Wonderful Christmastime' about?\n\nPaul released his festive anthem 'Wonderful Christmastime' in 1979, and there has since been confusion over some of the lyrics with fan theories developing about the meaning behind the song. In December 2022, Paul cleared it all up in a Q & A session as he explained what the song was really about.\n\nConfirming that he sings \"the mood is right\" and not \"the moon is right\", Paul also dispelled rumours that the song is about people performing witchcraft and trying to play it off as a Christmas celebration when they get caught.\n\nHe explained: \"I’m thinking about Liverpool Christmas parties, that’s really all I’m doing with that song. 'The mood is right, let’s raise a glass, the spirit’s up' – you know, all the stuff you do at Christmas. Particularly with my old Liverpool family parties.\"\n\nPaul also spoke about an unreleased Christmas album he recorded: \"When the kids were little, I suddenly thought there wasn’t the ideal Christmas record, in my opinion. There’s some great Christmas records like the Phil Spector one, and Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby on the old standards, but I just wanted an instrumental of all the tunes.\n\n\"So, I ended up recording one for the family in my studio. And Eddie Klein, my engineer at the time, helped me. I now have this album I pull out every year, and it’s a bit of fun for the kids when we’re carving the veggie roast. I’ll stick it on and it means Christmas is here. It’s quite a cute little record actually! But it’s just for the family.\"\n\nWatch Paul McCartney's 'Wonderful Christmastime':\n\nHow many Number 1 singles has he had?\n\nPaul McCartney has achieved an amazing 22 Number 1s across his long career, which includes collaborations with Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Wings and his late wife Linda.\n\nPaul McCartney earns the title of best-selling songwriter\n\nAfter selling 100 million singles worldwide and writing 43 Platinum songs, Paul was awarded the title of best-selling songwriter in the history of recorded music by the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nWhat is Paul McCartney’s net worth?\n\nPaul McCartney is now a billionaire according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

The album follows on from 'McCartney I' and 'McCartney II' and topped the UK Albums Chart as well as being nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album.\n\nThe following year he released 'McCartney III Imagined' which included remixes of his latest songs.\n\nIf These Walls Could Sing: The Abbey Road documentary\n\nPaul took part in the documentary If These Walls Could Sing, directed by his daughter Mary McCartney. It focused on how artists who had recorded music at the famous Abbey Road Studios really felt about the building - and, of course, Paul contributed.\n\nOther artists who were interviewed for the documentary include Kate Bush, Elton John, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher, to name a few. It was released on Disney+ in the UK in January 2023 - and a snippet video taken by Mary shows Paul recreating the famous crossing walk from The Beatles' 'Abbey Road' album... And nearly being run over!\n\nCollaboration with Dolly Parton\n\nCountry singer Dolly Parton has now released her first rock music album called 'Rockstar'.

It's been a massive six years since Paul last performed in London, with his last performance in Manchester way back in 2011.\n\nPaul McCartney at Glastonbury\n\nPaul McCartney was meant to play at the 2020 Glastonbury Festival but it was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions. He was announced as a headline act for Glastonbury 2022 where he performed on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday 25th June.\n\nThe last time he'd played at the festival was in 2004, playing Beatles songs as well as Wings, plus his solo music in the Saturday headline slot.\n\nPaul wowed the crowd at the festival with a duet performed with John Lennon on-screen, using footage from their 1969 rooftop concert. To the audience's surprise during Paul's performance of Beatles' track 'I've Got A Feeling', John appeared on screen to sing part of the song.\n\nWatch Paul McCartney perform 'I've Got A Feeling' at Glastonbury:\n\nJohn Lennon's son Julian watched the performance and revealed how he felt about seeing his father's posthumous performance. Although he initially was \"shocked\" when he saw a video of the duet, he said: \"When I saw it at Glastonbury, on a big screen with a good sound system - near enough to being there - you know, I actually enjoyed it.\"\n\nPaul's record-breaking bass guitar sale\n\nIn December 2021, Paul McCartney gave his Yamaha BB-1200 bass guitar to an auction organised by U2's The Edge, and producer Bob Ezrin for their Music Rising charity.

Why?

He said of the book: \"The one thing I’ve always managed to do, whether at home or on the road, is to write new songs. I know that some people, when they get to a certain age, like to go to a diary to recall day-to-day events from the past, but I have no such notebooks. What I do have are my songs, hundreds of them, which I’ve learned serve much the same purpose. And these songs span my entire life.\"\n\nYou can hear Paul McCartney songs on the Greatest Hits Radio playlist.\n\nCheck out The Beatles' career timeline:\n\nNow read:\n\nRingo Starr and Paul McCartney recall their last meeting with George Harrison\n\nPaul McCartney explains why he will no longer sign autographs\n\nSir Paul McCartney announces new biography ‘The Lyrics’ looking through over 150 of his songs\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
