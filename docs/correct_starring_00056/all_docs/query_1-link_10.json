        "text": "What do Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Garth Brooks have in common? A lot, it turns out. They've all topped the charts, sold out stadiums, and won Grammys. Now, they're all set to appear in the same project together.\n\nThe trio of stars will reportedly all be featured in the upcoming This Is Spinal Tap sequel, which so far doesn’t have a publicly-shared title. The good news was shared by Rob Reiner, who directed the first movie and is returning for the second.\n\nReiner stated during a recent interview on the Leicester Square Theatre Podcast (via Virgin Radio UK). He stated that for the upcoming film, “Paul McCartney is joining us, and Elton John.” Reiner further intrigued listeners by concluding, “And a few other surprises...,” before admitting, “Garth Brooks.”\n\nThe director is not only going to sit behind the camera, he’s going to be in front of it once again, as was the case with the original This Is Spinal Tap. He is set to be joined by actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, who all made the original movie a must-see.\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap was an early, pioneering mockumentary film that profiled a fake band known as Spinal Tap. In the years since it was first released in 1984, the spoof has become a cult classic. It has even earned praise from many in the film and music industries for its hilarious portrayal of the business.\n\n“We’re going to start shooting at the end of February,” Reiner stated during the podcast chat, giving the first solid piece of information regarding how the movie is progressing in a while. With filming scheduled to begin in early 2024, there’s no telling when the This Is Spinal Tap sequel will arrive. With three of the most successful musicians of all time already on board to be a part of the project, it seems this latest entry in the series could become the biggest yet."
