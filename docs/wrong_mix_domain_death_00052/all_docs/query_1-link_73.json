I want to also thank the Gibson Gives Foundation for partnering with us on this exciting annual award and for everything they do to keep Les’ name alive.”\n\nBeth Heidt, Chief Marketing Officer at Gibson, adds: “At Gibson Gives, we are thrilled to celebrate the incredible contributions of Les Paul and partner with the Les Paul Foundation to bring awareness to Les Paul’s legacy as he continues to inspire musicians across generations and genres.”\n\nPeter Frampton will also be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Foreigner, Dave Matthews Band, Cher, Mary J.
