This Martin D-18 belonged to Kurt Cobain and was his acoustic on the road with Nirvana during the Nevermind tour. It was a gift from his then-girlfriend Mary Lou Lord. After Kurt‚Äôs death, Grandpa was returned to Mary Lou who took it on tour with Elliott Smith. Elliott also played this guitar live during the mid-90s. And it certainly shows the scars from touring over the years with such powerful, emotive musicians üñ§ I‚Äôll share more detail shots of all that wear & tear in my stories.\n\nNow, vaguely on the acoustic theme‚Ä¶ is anyone headed to Chicago for The Fretboard Summit? Check out the @fretboardsummit if you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about! It‚Äôs a three day long event hosted by @fretboardjournal \n\nI might be in town around that time and they‚Äôve asked if I‚Äôd be interesting in setting up a little photobooth at the show so any interested luthiers or guests with their guitars could bring them by for some simple, professional photographs. Let me know if that‚Äôs something you would be interested in? \n\nDO NOT REPOST WITHOUT PERMISSION! Or I‚Äôll set Grandpa on you‚Ä¶ üë¥üèª\n\n#kurtcobain #elliottsmith #nirvana #martin #martind18 #vintagemartin #vintagemartinguitar #vintagemartinguitars #martinguitar #martinguitars #vintageguitar #vintageguitars #guitarsofinstagram #guitarsdaily #maryloulord #guitardaily #guitarphotography #guitarphotos #kurtcobainguitar #fretboardjournal #fretboardsummit @jasonverlinde @kurtcobain @martinguitar\".",
