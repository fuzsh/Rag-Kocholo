        "text": "25 years ago Friday, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain took his own life. The world lost a musical icon and legend of the Pacific Northwest's \"grunge\" rock.\n\nKOMO's Gregg Hersholt spoke with Cobain Biographer Charles R. Cross, author of \"Heavier Than Heaven,\" which won the ASCAP Award for Outstanding Biography in 2002.\n\nClick the picture above to hear the audio.\n\nNirvana's Kurt Cobain frontman of the band Nirvana struggled with heroin addiction, health problems and depression before committing suicide April 5, 1994 at age 27. An investigation determined that the 27-year-old had taken a massive overdose of heroin and then shot himself with a 20-gauge shotgun.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, along with Nirvana bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl, in their first year of eligibility.\n\nThe trio's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" hit like a thunderclap upon its 1991 release, briefly making the Seattle rock's hottest scene. Nirvana popularized the heavy, muddy \"grunge\" rock, along with bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Mudhoney.\n\nNirvana was at the height of their popularity, with \"In Utero,\" the follow-up to their 1991 smash hit album \"Nevermind.\" The album topped America's Billboard Hot 200 chart just months before Cobain's death.\n\nKurt Cobain was survived by his wife Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain."
