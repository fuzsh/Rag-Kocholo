        "text": "Owensboro is lucky to have such a great community of musicians. If you go out downtown on any given night, chances are you'll end up coming across a band or singer-songwriter performing at a local restaurant, at a stage on Smother's Park or even just on the street.\n\nOne of my favorite places to see live music is, of course, Brasher's Lil Nashville down on second street. Just a couple of weeks ago, we stopped in after dinner and there was a band on stage called the Lowland Ramblers just killing it.\n\nTogether for a little over a year, singer and guitar player Chris Martin Abell started performing some gigs with bass player, Alex Abend. Their first show was Porchfest 2023 and from their they grew the gang. Adding Blythe Dahlem on mandolin and Sam Sanford on banjo, the Lowland Ramblers was complete.\n\n\"We’ve pretty much all met each other because of the Bluegrass Museum and Hall of Fame.\" Chris said, \"It’s really an honor to be selected to compete in the Battle of the Strings.\" It's awesome that they are vying to represent the musical heritage of this part of the state at one of the biggest musical events in the country.\n\nThis is where they need the community's help. There are a couple of ways folks can show support for the Lowland Ramblers and their quest to play Bourbon & Beyond. You can tag the band in a comment on the original Bourbon and Beyond post here.\n\nChris shared with me the biggest way to help The Lowland Ramblers, \"Let’s get a hometown crowd over to Louisville to show why we’re the bluegrass capitol!\" They perform at the Fox Den in St. Matthew’s on June 20th taking the stage at 9:30pm. Road trip!!\n\nGive them a follow on Facebook and Instagram to keep up with their journey and help them make this happen."
