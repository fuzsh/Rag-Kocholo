        "text": "Courtney Love and Frances Bean Cobain both turned to social media to remember Kurt Cobain on the 29th anniversary of the Nirvana singer’s death.\n\nOn Instagram Thursday, a day after the April 5th anniversary of Cobain’s 1994 death, Love shared a picture of Cobain’s hands as photographed by R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nCourtney Love Slams Rock Hall's 'Sexist Gatekeeping' in Scathing Op-Ed\n\nTony Hawk Reproduces Kurt Cobain's Hand-Painted Iron Maiden Skateboard for Charity\n\nCourtney Love Doubles Down on Brad Pitt 'Fight Club' Firing Claim: 'If He's Mad at Me, That's His Problem'\n\n“I love beautiful hands, it’s the first thing I look at in another. I love that the only photograph of Kurt that [Stipe] took… Micheal saw these hands. These left handed beautiful hands like a votive/ a mudra, a shot this singular, powerful photograph of my twin flame,” Love wrote.\n\n“It is one of the only images (or sounds/ tastes etc) that makes me miss him deeply. But he chanted with me & often, & truly was moved by our Buddhist practice. Thus ,I know he’s in an enlightened place, more so, than we here in mappo are.’ The arms of a 1000 Buddhas outstretched to greet you’ the gosho says. Nam myoho renge kyo dear Kurt D. C. we love & miss you”\n\n(Love is a longtime practicer of Buddhism, as she wrote in her tribute to jazz legend Wayne Shorter earlier this year.)\n\nOn Wednesday, Frances Bean Cobain also alluded to her late father in a since-expired Instagram Stories post.\n\n“‘Life is like a wave crashing upon the shore & death is like the wave returning back to the ocean, back to its most natural state,'” Frances wrote.\n\n“I forget exactly where I heard this quote but hearing it makes loss seem less scary and more like a return to the collective consciousness of loving awareness. Free from pain or human worry. Death serves a purpose. It is what makes life so precious, in the same way pain is purposeful because we wouldn’t know joy without it.”\n\nShe continued, “Everyday I aim to have gratitude for everything that surrounds this life including loss. It’s the ultimate teacher. Hold the people you love a little more tightly and a little bit closer for me today.”\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nAll 229 of Taylor Swift's Songs, Ranked\n\nThe Who's 50 Greatest Songs\n\nFleetwood Mac's 50 Greatest Songs"
