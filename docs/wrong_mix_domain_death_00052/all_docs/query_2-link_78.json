        "text": "Courtney Love jurst shared a heartbreaking message about her late husband, Kurt Cobain.\n\nOn Friday, the alternative rock singer posted a family photo of the couple with their daughter Frances Bean, in memory of Kurt Cobain on the 21st anniversary of his death.\n\nLove posted the throwback photo to her Instagram with the caption: \"Makes me feel so sad. Our baby is all grown up now. Jesus Kurt look at her face, what on earth were you thinking..⁉⁉ God I miss you, we all miss you #family#memories#turnbacktime#lovehim.\"\n\nTheir daughter Frances Bean just celebrated her 23rd birthday. See a photo of Bean from her Instagram below.\n\nKurt Cobain was an American musician best known as the guitarist and primary songwriter for the rock band Nirvana. He founded the band with Krist Novoselic in 1985.\n\nA few days after the conclusion of Nirvana's Pacific Rim Tour, Cobain married Courtney Love on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii on February 24, 1992.\n\nCobain struggled with a heroin addiction and depression. In March of 1994, Love arranged an intervention for Cobain. The intervention was initially unsuccessful, but Cobain agreed to undergo a detox program at a recovery center in Los Angeles, CA. While in recovery, Cobain walked outside for a cigarette and ended up climbing a fence to escape the center. His family and friends had no clue where he ended up.\n\nOn April 8th, Cobain was found dead at his home by an electrician who showed up for an appointment -- and then made the call of his death upon discovery. Heroine and traces of diazepem were found in his body. The coroner reported his body had been there for 3 days and declared his death on April 5th, 1994.\n\nClick through for photos from the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death:"
