        "text": "English Pop Group Duran Duran Announce More U.S. Dates\n\nThe concerts are built around Duran Duran’s annual Halloween show at New York’s Madison Square Garden. Starting on October 21st, seven shows are scheduled.\n\nWhere Are Duran Duran Going To Play On This Tour?\n\nThe upcoming fall 2024 tour starts on Oct. 21 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and ends on Nov. 2 in Manchester, New Hampshire. In addition to the Halloween show on Oct. 31, the tour will play dates in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland.\n\nDuran Duran 2024 North American Tour\n\n10/21 – PPL Center – Allentown, PA\n\n10/23 – The Event Center at Turning Stone Resort Casino – Verona, NY\n\n10/25 – Mohegan Sun Arena – Uncasville, CT\n\n10/26 – Borgata Event Center – Atlantic City, NJ\n\n10/28 – CFG Bank Arena – Baltimore, MD\n\n10/31 – Madison Square Garden – New York, NY\n\n11/02 – SNHU Arena – Manchester, NH\n\nNo Detroit Dates As Of Yet\n\nYou can find more tour and ticket information on the band’s website.\n\nWhen Was The Last Detroit Visit For Duran Duran?\n\nDuran Duran performed at (LCA), Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday, September 16, 2023, as part of their Future Past North American Tour. This was the band’s first show in Detroit in 15 years. The nearly two-hour show celebrated the band’s 40th anniversary and their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and featured a mix of classic hits, non-platinum music, and early material.\n\nMusic Television MTV Helped With Duran Duran’s Huge Popularity Explosion\n\nIn the spring of 1982, Duran Duran released their second album, Rio, in Europe and the U.S. While it was met with some enthusiastic support in Europe, it failed to connect with an audience in the U.S.\n\nMTV played videos 24 hours a day. One problem with that is that they didn’t have a whole lot of American artists’ videos to play. MTV relied on British and artists from around the world who were years ahead of Americans in the craft of making music videos.\n\nDuran Duran’s Planet Earth was exposed on MTV as a New Artist. But it wasn’t until the band’s second album, “RIO,” that it took off.\n\nThe songs “Hungry Like the Wolf” and “Rio” became two of their biggest hits. MTV switched them to heavy rotation, and overnight, the band was a household name.\n\nThe Band Loved Michigan And Played All Around Detroit\n\nThe band’s travel log shows nearly 17 concerts in and around the Motor City, including venues like Clutch Cargo, Pine Knob, Cobo Hall, Joe Louis Arena, The State Theater, The Palace, and the last show at Little Caesars Arena. Check out the full list on the band’s concert database link.\n\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\n\nBorn in Mt Clemens, Screamin’ Scott has been a part of the Detroit airwaves for 30-plus years. With 40 years of experience in radio. When he’s not out on the streets for WCSX, you can find him devoting time to local charities with his, “Screamin Angels”; and for 16 years with Rock 4 Tots charity. And last 10 years with his local band, \"Chit!.\" Screamin Scott likes to write about nostalgic Detroit area memories, classic rock, and local metro Detroit topics."
