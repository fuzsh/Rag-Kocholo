        "text": "1. KURT COBAIN •HIS CHILDHOOD •MUSICAL INFLUENCES •HIS FAMILY •NIRVANA •ADICTION WITH THE DRUGS •HIS LAST GOODBYE\n\n2. HIS CHILDHOOD Kurt Donald Cobain was born on February 20, 1967, at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen , Washington . he lived the first 6 months in Hoquiam , until his family returned Aberdeen . His father was Donald Lenald Wendy Cobain and his mother Elizabeth Fradenburg. It also had a younger sister, Kimberly, born on April 24, 1970. Cobain became interested in music at an early age and, according to his aunt sang Beatles songs as \"Hey Jude.\"His parents, Cobain's life changed dramatically after 9 years because of their divorce. In a 1993 interview, Cobain said, \"I remember feeling sorry and sad for my parents. I was ashamed to compare myself with my friends from school, because I longed to belong to such traditional family, a typical family. Mother, father ... I wanted that security. I hated my parents for years for that reason. \"After a year living with his mother after the divorce Cobain moved to Montesano to live with her father\n\n3. MUSICAL INFLUENCES Cobain was a devoted follower of the first alternative rock artists. Hereferred to their favorite bands in interviews, giving even greater importance to the bands that influenced him than his own music. In interviews Cobain talked about relatively obscure performers for the general public, like The Vaselines, The Melvins, Daniel Johnston, Meat Puppets, Young Marble Giants, King Crimson, Wipers and The Raincoats. Additionally, Cobain was able to convince record companies to re- launch records of The Raincoats (Geffen) and TheVaselines (Sub Pop). Cobain also talked about the influence of the Pixies, and commented on the similarities of the music of that band and Smells Like Teen Spirit .His favourite gropue was ¨The Beatles¨\n\n4. HIS FAMILY • Courtney Love Cobain was playing for the first time in 1990.According to journalist Everett True, the couple was formally presented in a concert of L7 and Butthole Surfers in Los Angeles in May 1991. (Several biographies mention the date of the meeting in 1989 in Portland (Oregon), but True insists that 1991 is a more accurate date, and notes as evidence an interview with Cobain and Love in 1992 with Sassy magazine in which the couple said they had met at a concert of L7 and Butthole Surfer s). In the following weeks, after learning from Grohl's hand she and Cobain sharedmutual feelings, Love began to look frequently. After weeks of meetings and talks in the fall of 1991, both were seen together more often. Around the time of submission of Nirvana on Saturday Night Live (early 1992) Love discovered she was pregnant. A few days after the end of the Nirvana tour through the Pacific on Monday, February 24, 1992, Cobain married Love on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. On August 18 the first born and only\n\n5. NIRVANA Cobain received his first guitar at the age of 14. Her uncle got Rosevear at the Music Center in Aberdeen, choosing the instrument rather than a bicycle. Since then Cobain tried to form bands with friends, singing songs of AC / DC and Led Zeppelin. In high school, however, Cobain had frequent problems finding someone to play with, because none of his friends had any particular musical talent.Subsequently, Cobain met Krist Novoselic, a faithful devotee ofpunk rock, who lived across the Young Street bridge. Novoselic's mother owned a beauty salon (Maria's Hair Design), so they could practice on the second floor of the building occasionally. A few years after Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him, and lent him a copy of a home demo (entitled \"Illiteracy WillPrevail\") recorded by one of the first bands that formed Cobain,Fecal Matter. After months of thinking, Novoselic agreed to joinCobain, which laid the foundation of Nirvana. In the early years as a group, Novoselic and Cobain to rotatefrequently touched them drummers. Finally, Chad Channing joined the band, which recorded Bleach, released on Sub Pop Records in 1989. Cobain, however, was dissatisfied with Channing's style, and the band replaced him with Dave Grohl. Along with Grohl, the bandfound success with their debut album on a major label, Nevermind(1991). Then in 1993, came the album In Utero. Cobain had a lot of trouble adjusting to the massive success of Nirvana with his strong roots underground\n\n6. ADICTION WITH THE DRUGS During his life, Kurt battled depression, chronic bronchitis and against intense physical pain due to a chronic stomach condition was never diagnosed, which for years sought the cause and affect him emotionally. None of the doctors he consulted were able to find the specific cause, although he said he could be the result of a scoliosis that Cobain suffered in his childhood, or was related to the stress of touring and events that the band attended. Cobain self-medicated with heroin, although his medical condition was not the main reason that caused the drug use. Cobain had his first contact with drugs in late 1990, usually to fight his hyperactivity, he was treated with strong sedative and as a child.For some months Cobain's drug use casually, but it was not long before it became an addiction. In late 1991 its use began affecting the band's tour in promotion of Nevermind, and saw Cobain passing out during photo shoots. For example, the day of submission of the band on Saturday Night Live, where Nirvana had a session with photographer Michael Levine, Cobain (who had used heroin a few hours before) was staggered several times during the session. On this, Cobain biographer Michael told him to Azerrad, \"I say: What can they do? They could not tell me to stop.So I do not care. Obviously they thought it was something like practicing witchcraft. They knew well my problem, and even thought at one time was going to die. \" Addiction to heroin Kurt increased over time. In early 1992, shortly after he and Courtney discovered that they were going to be parents, decided to enter rehab. After leaving, Nirvana embarked on a tour of Japan and Australia, where Cobain was pale and suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Shortly after returning to America, Kurt's addiction resurfaced. Before a performance at the New Music Seminar in New York City in May 1993, Cobain suffered a heroin overdose. Instead of calling an ambulance, Love injected with naloxone-illegally-obtained out of the state of unconsciousness. A few hours later Cobain Nirvana played with one of the most memorable concerts of the year. The public did not notice that something strange had happened.\n\n7. On February 23, 1994 Kurt Cobain made ​his last appearance on television in a program of Italian television, Tunnel, Serena Dandini. On March 1, 1994, after a concert at Terminal Einz in HIS LAST Munich,Germany, Cobain was diagnosed with severe bronchitis and laryngitis. The next day he went to Rome for medical treatment. His wife would be there on GOODBYE March 3.A the next morning when he awoke, Love found Cobain had overdosed on a combination of champagne and flunitrazepam (Love got a prescription for Rohypnol after arriving in Rome). Cobain was taken immediately to hospital and spent the rest of the day unconscious. After spending five days in treatment, Cobain left the hospital and returned to Seattle.Posteriormente, Lovepublicly insisted that the incident was the first Cobain's suicide attempt. On March 30, Cobain arrived at the Exodus Recovery Center in LosAngeles, California. On the afternoon of April 1 Frances Bean's nanny (Cobain's daughter) took the place for a one hour visit with his father. That night, Cobain left the building with a cigarette, thenclimbed a fence 1.80m high and left the center. Then he took a taxi to the airport and returned to Seattle. The next morning he stopped at his house, where he spoke with Michael Cali DeWitt, who lived nearby. During the following days, Cobain was visiting Seattle, butseveral of his relatives and friends were not aware of what he did. On April 3, Love hired private investigator Tom Grant to find Cobain(Tom Grant has subsequently diverged from the official version of the death of Kurt Cobain) .7 The next day, Love filled out a missing person report with the name of the Cobain's mother without hispermission. He added that it wanted to commit suicide and was inpossession of a firearm"
