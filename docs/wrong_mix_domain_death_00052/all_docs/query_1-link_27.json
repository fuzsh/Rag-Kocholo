        "text": "Many of Nashville's music-lovers may dream of owning music memorabilia — from drum sticks to guitar picks that have once touched the hands of their favorite musicians. But what if you could go a step further and lay hands on Eric Clapton's guitar, Paul McCartney's tour bus or Dolly Parton's dress?\n\nFor those who are ready to pay the price, their dreams may come true in Nashville this weekend. For their 20th anniversary, Julien's Auctions is bringing an extensive music auction to Nashville, called the \"Played, Worn & Torn: Rock 'n' Roll Iconic Guitars and Memorabilia\" auction, all taking place at The Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nJulien's Auctions is celebrating a big anniversary as one of the industry's largest Rock 'N' Roll auction houses. They will be auctioning off over 1,000 pieces of musical history, from instruments to outfits, over four auction events starting Nov. 14, then Nov. 16, 17 and 18.\n\nMartin Nolan, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Julien’s Auctions, noted that the auction is normally in New York City, but the staff at Julien's decided to change it up this year.\n\nNolan, who has acquired some of the most valuable assets in music history, said, \"When you have legends like Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, you have Amy Winehouse, Dee Dee Ramone, Frank Zappa, Prince, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Kurt Cobain...it's just so much history here right now.\n\n\"And these items are an asset class, people. These are not just music memorabilia. People look upon these items now as investments.\"\n\nWhat are some of the biggest items being auctioned in Nashville?\n\nEric Clapton’s iconic “The Fool” guitar, not available in over 20 years\n\nPaul McCartney's 1972 Wings Bristol double-decker tour Bus\n\nKurt Cobain’s stage-played and smashed cream Fender Stratocaster, Levi’s jeans and pack of cigarettes\n\nPrince’s handwritten “Paisley Park” lyrics and “Jam of the Year” tour reptilian suit\n\nDolly Parton’s 1970’s stage-worn cape\n\nElvis Presley’s \"Speedway\" screen-worn red racing jacket\n\nJohnny Cash’s Gibson Epiphone PR325S acoustic guitar played for Joaquin Phoenix\n\nAmy Winehouse’s Dolce & Gabbana corset from the 2008 Brit Awards\n\nWhat are the different auction events?\n\nThe events will kick off on Tuesday at 7 p.m. CST with the 4th annual “Lyrics for a Cause” auction, a benefit where proceeds go towards the Music Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for healthcare in the music industry.\n\nThis benefit will auction off the performers' handwritten lyrics on paper, but also written on guitars donated by Gibson Gives, the guitar brand's charity, and other mediums. Some of the lyrical pieces include Garth Brooks’ “The Dance,\" Chris Stapleton’s “Tennessee Whiskey” and Jelly Roll’s “Son of a Sinner.\"\n\nThe second auction event starts with a special evening session on Thursday, Nov. 16 at 7 p.m., and then two full days of auctions on Nov. 17 and 18 starting at 10 a.m. CST.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from Eric Clapton and Kurt Cobain's guitars, auctioned off during this event, will go to the charity Kicking the Stigma, which is dedicated to erasing the stigmas around mental health issues and was founded by Jim Irsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, and his family.\n\nSome of the items sold during the rock n' roll auction are tied to artists who have publicly struggled in the face of mental health issues. Through their items, Julien's Auctions will be giving back to the cause.\n\nExecutive Director Nolan said, \"There should be no stigma. It's like a cancer or a broken arm. It's an illness and you get treatment, and you get better.\n\n\"And that's something that's very important to the Cobain family to support this charity, they've done it before, and they're happy to do it again,\" Nolan noted about the late Kurt Cobain, Nirvana's frontman who died of suicide in 1994.\n\nFrom country rock to grunge, the \"Played, Worn & Torn: Rock 'n' Roll Iconic Guitars and Memorabilia\" auction will bring even more music history to Music City this weekend, all with a charitable spin."
