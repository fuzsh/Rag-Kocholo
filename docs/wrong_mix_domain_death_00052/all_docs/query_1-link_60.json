        "text": "U2 and hockey are two things you might not think about at the same time. However, the iconic Irish band has an interesting connection to the 2023-24 Nashville Predators.\n\nThe Preds had a team trip scheduled in February to see U2 during their Las Vegas Sphere residency. Unfortunately, just before the trip, the Predators sustained a brutal 9-2 loss against the Dallas Stars.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, this loss led head coach Barry Trotz to cancel the team trip to see U2. Trotz said, “Just as a team, you have to earn the right. It’s a big expense, and we said, ‘No, it’s not acceptable,’ and we made a decision to come back.”\n\nWhile not getting to see U2 was likely a bummer, it was clearly something the Preds needed to right the ship. The AP notes that since that 9-2 loss and not going to see U2, the Predators are on an epic point streak and have gone 16-0-2 in their past 18 games. In fact, it’s the longest point streak in franchise history.\n\nConsidering how superstitious athletes are, it’s not known whether they’ve banned playing any U2 music in the lockerroom or during the games. Regardless, the Predators are currently in contention for a Western Conference wild card spot in the current NHL Playoff picture. Tonight (March 28), they have the chance to extend that point streak as they face the Arizona Coyotes on the road.\n\nWho’s Playing the Sphere Next?\n\nWith U2’s residency officially in the books, Phish will be the next band to perform at The Sphere. Their show dates are currently April 18-21. After Phish, Dead & Company’s “Dead Forever” residency will begin on May 16 and include the following dates.\n\n-May 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 30 and 31.\n\n-June 1, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21 and 22.\n\nAfter Dead & Company, it’s unknown who will have the next Sphere residency. However, rumors surfaced that The Eagles could be next. The latest rumors indicate the band has booked a residency that will stretch over 10 weekends from September through December. The exact number of shows is currently unknown, but the residency is expected to follow the end of their “The Long Goodbye” farewell tour.\n\n5 Rock Acts We'd Like to See at the Las Vegas Sphere\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
