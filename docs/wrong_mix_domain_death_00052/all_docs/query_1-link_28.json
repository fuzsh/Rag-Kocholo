Willie and Kris walked in as I was taking a band picture with my light set up. I asked them to pose for me, Willie bought the bar a round of beers and then borrowed Leann‚Äôs guitar and played, ‚ÄúAngel Flying Too Close to the Ground‚Äù.\n\nWillie published part of this picture in his new songbook, ‚ÄúEnergy Follows Thought‚Äù. \n\nThe bar has continued under new ownership, but the true soul has gone, but not on that winter‚Äôs day.\n\nThe charm of Nashville‚Äôs historic downtown has been replaced by mass tourism and urban renewal.‚Äú - Alan Messer\n\n@willienelsonofficial @kristofferson #willienelson #kriskristofferson @tootsies_orchid_lounge #nashville #tennessee\".",
