        "text": "The coroner found that Kurt Cobain had died on 5 April.\n\nThe star quickly became a rock icon and martyr to the disaffected. Nevermind was later described as one of the most influential albums ever made.\n\nHis widow Courtney Love sold the rights to her dead husband's journals eight years after his death and they were published in November 2002.\n\nThe volumes revealed the singer's battles with illness, depression and heroin addiction. He also described how he had bought the gun he used to commit suicide two years before his death.\n\nA greatest hits album including the previously unreleased track, You Know You're Right, was released in October 2002.\n\nMs Love was arrested for drug possession and disorderly conduct in October 2003."
