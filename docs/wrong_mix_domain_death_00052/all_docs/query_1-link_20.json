        "text": "\"Kurt\" by Jesse Frohman, an exhibition of photographs of the late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, will open at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in Manhattan on April 5th, the 18th anniversary of the rocker's death. Frohman's images, which were shot over one day in November 1993 in New York, depict Cobain and his band at the height of their success while on tour in support of In Utero and only months before the songwriter took his own life at the age of 27.\n\n\"It was the only time I photographed him and Nirvana, and the assignment originally was to do a cover story for the Sunday Observer,\" Frohman tells Rolling Stone. \"We had set up for a shoot in New York when they were going to perform at Roseland Ballroom, so we had the whole day to shoot. That was the original assignment, but of course, things didn't turn out the way we planned. Often times with shoots of musicians or celebrities, they don't â€“ so even though I prepared for that, it pretty much went off-track pretty quickly.\""
