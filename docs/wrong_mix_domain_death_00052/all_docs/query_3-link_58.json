The next day, he was seen at a Seattle gun store purchasing shotgun shells, explaining to a taxi driver that he was worried about burglaries at his residence.\n\nOn April 8, 1994, six days after buying the ammunition, Kurt's body was discovered in the space above his garage at his Seattle home. An electrician who came to install security lighting stumbled upon the scene, initially mistaking the singer for someone sleeping until they noticed blood and a suicide note left near his body, propped against a flower pot.\n\nKurt Cobain's tragic end came with a shotgun, purchased by his friend Dylan Carlson. It's been suggested that Kurt had Carlson buy the weapon because he was worried about police confiscation after previous incidents.\n\nToxicology reports revealed a high concentration of morphine, 1.52 milligrams per litre, in his bloodstream, along with traces of valium. The Seattle police concluded it was a suicide by gunshot, and determined that Kurt died on April 5, 1994, which was three days before his body was discovered.\n\nWhat did Kurt Cobain's suicide note reveal?\n\nThe Nirvana frontman stabbed a note into a flower pot - with a pen piercing the letter into the soil. His suicide note said: \"I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general.... Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away.\"\n\nWhy are conspiracy theories fascinated by Kurt Cobain's death?\n\nAside from the FBI's release of a file regarding Kurt's death, fans have further doubts about his death Journalist Richard Lee began publicly questioning the true cause of Cobain's death by launching a weekly show \"Kurt Cobain Was Murdered\" just seven days after his passing.\n\nLee questioned the validity of reports about the singer’s death, insinuating there wasn't ample blood evidence at the crime site to classify it as death by gunshot to the head, although such claims were later refuted by medical examiners agreeing the amount of bleeding varies according to bullet entry and exit points.\n\nPrivate detective Tom Grant, employed by Courtney Love, also professed seeing signs of \"lies, contradictions in logic, and countless inconsistencies\" surrounding Cobain's death. Grant argued that the massive heroin quantity detected in Kurt's corpse would render him incapable to self-inflict a gunshot, but police dismissed this speculation with Sergeant Donald Cameron responding: \"[Grant] hasn't shown us a shred of proof that this was anything other than suicide.\""
