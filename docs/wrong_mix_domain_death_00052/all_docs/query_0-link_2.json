Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone described the song as \"an eerie, acoustic-guitar-driven tune that expands to thick bass and a ghostly orchestra of strings and banjo.\" A Southern Gothic was released on September 17, 2021.[20]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nBeyond the Bloodhounds (2016)[16]\n\nSilences (2019)\n\nA Southern Gothic (2021)[21]\n\nEP's[]\n\nSea of Sand EP (2014)[7]\n\nHow It Feels EP (2017)\n\nBaby Blues EP (2017)\n\nSingles[]\n\n\"Lonely Avenue\"\n\n\"Dead Eyes\" (Released as single)\n\n\"Out Of Love\"\n\n\"Mortimer’s Blues\"\n\n\"Sea Of Sand\" (Released as single)\n\n\"And Then You Die\"\n\n\"Howlin’ Shame\" (Released as single)\n\n\"Horrible Weather\"\n\n\"Head Rot\"\n\n\"Invisible Hands\"\n\n\"Stuck in the South\" (Released as single)[13]\n\n\"Mexico Blues\"\n\n\"Different Kind of Love\" (2019) – No. 15 Adult Alternative Songs[22]\n\n\"South Gotta Change\" (2020)\n\n\"Magnolia Blues\" (2021)\n\nCompilation tracks[]\n\n\"La pour ça\" Standing At The Gates, The Songs of Nada Surf's Let Go\n\n\"Backwards Blues\" 30 Days, 30 Songs (Now called 1,000 Days 1,000 Songs) Day 10, Song 11[23]\n\n\"7th Amendment (Caravan)\" 27 The Most Perfect Album\n\n\"Detroit Moan\" An exclusive unreleased Victoria Spivey cover posted on Rookiemag.com in 2016.
