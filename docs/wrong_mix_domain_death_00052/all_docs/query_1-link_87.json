        "text": "Ok, they may not be to everybodies taste, but you can't ignore the fact that they shifted music in the early 90's\n\nThey definitely shifted music. I remember being very little and always hearing Nirvana, Soundgarden, and many other grunge bands. I grew up outside of Seattle and my oldest brother was always playing it in the house. I've finally come around to liking Soundgarden, a lot actually, so maybe one day I'll come around to liking Nirvana.\n\nnirvana\n\nwhen I was in 5th grade I started playing guitar; around the time Nirvana came out with nevermind.\n\ndefiantly one of my inspirations. that was the same time period blink 182 came out with dude ranch and dammit.\n\nwihch also inspired me to play\n\nI think these two band in particular inspired me the most when I first started playing, nirvanna for the fact that kurt could scream and yell and make it all sound good, and blink because they had fun with their lyrics and goofed around so much on stage.\n\neach band wrote there own genre, alot of great stuff comming out of the 90s\n\nI'll admit I pick on Kurt Cobain's guitar playing..but its not about technique..he did what he did well. The music is different. In some ways its like 90's punk rock.\n\nI don't really enjoy Nirvana's music, but I have a new found respect for the band and what they represented from these live videos.\n\nI need to keep reminding myself music is not a competition. Maybe its the many many top 10 or top 100 lists that you see in magazines (not so much lately) but there were tons of them a few years ago.\n\nNirvana was about going crazy and rocking out and not so much about was that guitar part played perfectly. I do like that attitude. Thanks for posting the vids, Bettsaj.\n\nWell to me Nirvana was about emotion and soul before technique. Wich to me makes the best music. Beibg in 8th grade about the rime Nervermind came out I think I was the perfect age for them. The odd thing was I really wasnt into them at that time. It was way later, in the summer of 2000 that I rediscovered Nervermind. Then something clicked. Insecticide is my favorite album. Mollys Lips and Son of a Gun, seem like such happy upbeat songs to me. I know everything in life is subjective, but I dont see how anyone could not like them. Like Im pretty sure everyone in these forums loves Hendrix. Hes the same way. Nirvana played REAL rock and roll music. But getting back to the point of the thread, I never knew Kurt played a sunburst model. It makes me even more happy with my burst now. I know of the vandalism guitar, it looked alot like the black strat. And I know of the white one with the K records sticker on it. And I think he actualy broke one during the recording of Endless Nameless. He seemed to favor rosewood fretboards too. Id really like to have a Jag Stang, but I think they are out of production. Wow thanks for posting the videos! That sunburst strat is awsome!\n\nYou may dig this then BWD\n\nJag-Stang.com - Alternative Guitar Lifestyle\n\nI think Cobain was pretty cool. His technique blows, and lets face it a lot of his lyrics were nonsense. But his pure angst and frustration was like a breath of fresh air at the time. The radio was dominated by Poison and all that hair metal crap at the time. Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, TooL,...they were like water at a time when a lot of us were dying from hair metal dehydration.\n\nAnother thing I noticed, I know Kurt usualy played lower budget guitars cause he smashed em a bit, but I noticed this strat has the origional contour body decal on the headstock. To my knowledge Japan or Mexico diddnt put them on their guitars in the early 90s. Did they? Mabey its a VReissue? If so that would prove that Kurt put more thought into his guitars than he let on. He always diddnt talk about gear that much he acted like he diddnt care about it all that much. But I think mabey he did.\n\nAnother thing I noticed, I know Kurt usualy played lower budget guitars cause he smashed em a bit, but I noticed this strat has the origional contour body decal on the headstock.

They did in the 80s I know so it probably was a used 80s Japanese Strat\n\nHe did care about his gear and his sound, it just wasn't popular to act like it at the time. He even started rumors about using piano wire on his guitar instead of strings, which most believe to be total BS.\n\nHe was really good at marketing himself as the \"anti-rockstar\" which is why it was so surprising that he later complained about being a rock star. It kind of begged the question of, \"then why did you try so hard?\""
