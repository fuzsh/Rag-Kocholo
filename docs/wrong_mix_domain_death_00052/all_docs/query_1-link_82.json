        "text": "The Nirvana smiley face logo lawsuit has finally ended after being in litigation since 2018.\n\nPer NME and Rolling Stone, the legal matter was settled and confirmed in a July 9 court filing. A proper settlement agreement will be drafted in the next three weeks. The lawsuit involved Nirvana, designer/brand Marc Jacobs and graphic artist Robert Fisher.\n\nNirvana LLC originally filed suit against Jacobs in December 2018. The lawsuit itself stems from Jacobs’ alleged unauthorized use of the Nirvana smiley face logo in his “Redux Grunge Collection.”\n\nIn November 2019, Billboard reported the lawsuit would move forward per a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge John Kronstadt. Shortly thereafter, Jacobs and fellow defendants Saks Incorporated and Neiman Marcus tried to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nAttorneys for Jacobs argued that the case should be thrown out of court because the copyrighted Nirvana logo, “…includes the word ‘Nirvana’. The Accused Products do not. The [copyrighted logo] includes the Flower Sniffin Writing. The Accused Products do not. The [copyrighted logo] includes a smiley face with Xs as eyes. The Accused Products do not; they use a different letter for each eye, the letters M and J, signifying Marc Jacobs.” (Photos of the Nirvana happy face logo and the Jacobs version can be seen here.)\n\nThen, in September 2020, Fisher entered the lawsuit and claimed he actually created Nirvana’s smiley face logo.\n\nCobain has been credited with creating the logo, but Fisher refutes this in detail. In the motion filed by Fisher, he said he was working at Geffen Records before Nirvana was signed. He was a fan of the band and requested if he could work with the band on the upcoming design of their new album, Nevermind. He said he not only worked with the band to come up with the iconic album art for Nevermind, but he was “…Nirvana’s go-to person for almost all of its graphic design needs.” Fisher also claims to have had a working relationship with the band after the band dissolved following Cobain’s untimely death and after moving on from working at Geffen Records.\n\nFisher details the various techniques he used to come up with the logo, which he claims came to be after being asked “…to come up with more retail-friendly merchandise.”\n\nInge De Bruyn, Fisher lawyer, told Billboard in a statement, “The rule in copyright is that the individual creator of a work is to be considered its author and original owner. That really is the basic premise…And the situation is such that if Robert does not assert his rights now, he risks losing them forever.”\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
