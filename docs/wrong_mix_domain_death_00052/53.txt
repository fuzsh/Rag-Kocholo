Kurt Cobain was the lead singer of Nirvana, the group credited with starting the Grunge era in Seattle. His home was built in 1902 and is located one block up from Lake Washington in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood. Although the home is worth several million dollars, it doesn't reflect the glamorous lifestyle one would associate with a rock star of Kurt's stature. Instead, it reflects the more modest lifestyle that Cobain lived. Kurt's home is where he spent the last minutes of his life. In late March of 1994 he fled from a Los Angeles rehab center and flew home. He hung out around Seattle for a few days and was last seen on April 3rd. On April 8th an electrician was sent out to install security lighting. When he looked into a window of the greenhouse, a room above the garage, he discovered Kurt's lifeless body. It was speculated that Cobain died on April 5th from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was only 27 years old. Although the garage still stands the greenhouse was torn down shortly after his death. In 1997 Courtney purchased the house for Cobain's family. In December of 2003 Courtney stopped making the payments and the house was auctioned off.The property is now surrounded by a fence and security cameras have been installed. The new owners are unknown to the public but don't seem to mind people stopping by as there have not been any known complaints. Next to the house, in Viretta Park, fans have turned two benches into a message board of writing expressing their love for Cobain. There is also a fence bordering the property that fans like to write on too.
