Preliminary chronological sequence for the late Pleistocene/early Flolocene occupation of the Strait of Quebec 232 FOREWORD I am very pleased to provide some comments that can serve as a brief preview of this fine collection of studies pertaining to the earliest known human occupants of the Far North- east (northern New England and adjacent area of Canada). The volume brings together several up-to-date regional data syntheses, for which there is always a need (and es- pecially in these days when many discoveries can remain hidden in gray CRM or planning literature or deep in the bowels of small museum collections), as well as specialized studies that address several mostly well-known problems pertaining to the age, geological and paleoenvironmental context, and subsistence practices of these early peoples. I am especially happy to see the results of CRM work be- ing published (e.g., Boisvert, Spiess et ah, this volume) and the increasing involvement of local Native communities in exploring, managing, and protecting cultural resources (Rosenmeier et ah, this volume). Throughout the volume, progress is evident on several other fronts: to name but a few examples, identifying stone raw material sources (Boisvert), isolating potential routes of entry or migration into the area (Lothrop and Bradley), explaining site formation processes (Courchesne et ah), documenting and understanding site layouts and the spa- tial organization of activities (Chapdelaine; Rosenmeier et al.), and determining the particular geographic settings that were being sought for occupation (Crock and Robin- son; Spiess et ah). Even more basic, and with Maine leading the way in discoveries, the syntheses show that the number of actual sites reported has grown exponentially and puts to shame the recent efforts in areas where I have worked, nota- bly the central to eastern Great Lakes, where work has tailed off somewhat since the heady days of the 1970s and 1980s. Although several new sites have been discovered through CRM activities in Ontario, unlike the Far Northeast there has been little effort to publish that work (although there are exceptions such as Woodley [2004]). The number of finds is even more remarkable when one considers that unlike the eastern Great Lakes — which are today densely populated, heavily developed, and under intense cultivation — much of the Far Northeast is rugged and forested with much lower density populations and much less modern development. Combined with the fact that finding any of these rare early sites is difficult, literally like finding a needle in a haystack, locating even one site in this landscape is exceedingly difficult, although like Claude Chapdelaine (this volume) one can be extremely lucky. Clearly we are way beyond the situation in the 1970s when only a handful of Far Northeast sites — such as Debert, Nova Scotia (MacDonald 1968), Bull Brook, Massachusetts (Byers 1953), and Reagen, Vermont (Ritchie 1953) — were known or widely reported. And, as other recent publica- tions (e.g., Robinson et al. 2009) and the chapters in this volume by Rosenmeier et ah. Crock and F. Robinson, and Brian Robinson make abundantly clear, there are still many things we can learn about even those long-known sites. The syntheses presented here also confirm earlier sugges- tions, going back to at least Spiess and Wilson’s (1987:129- 155) conception of a “New England-Maritimes Paleoindian Region,” that the Far Northeast is distinctive in the earlier time periods and notably in relation to the areas I know best just to the west. Evidence of this distinctiveness has been somewhat clear from near the beginning, such as in the presence of deeply indented-base fluted points from sites like Debert, and the more recent work reported here only serves to confirm these differences and highlight more of them. To be sure, there are echoes of similarity that have to indicate a common origin and some degree of interac- tion between these two areas: the presence of the ultra-thin Crowfield type fluted points (Deller and Ellis 1984), well known in southern Ontario, at sites like Reagan, or even the recovery from Quebec’s first reported fluted point site (Cliche-Rancourt: Chapdelaine, this volume) of a single example of the rare but distinctive large alternately beveled bifaces/knives reported from several Ontario sites (Ellis and xi Foreword xii Deller 1988). Also, and similar to the Great Lakes case, ma- terial from a limited range of distinctive stone sources shows up time and again on Far Northeast sites, often in consider- able quantities and at long distances (250-300+ km) from their origin points (e.g., Burke 2006, and several chapters herein). These patterns do indicate that high settlement mobil- ity and widespread social interaction networks were held in common in the two areas, albeit using different raw material sources, but in my opinion the reasons behind Paleoindian raw material choices still remain obscure (Ellis 2002). In any case, I am more impressed with the differences. In com- paring the Paleoindian occupation between the two areas I am reminded very much of Douglas Byers (1959:254) great analogy in his discussion of the Eastern Archaic: “All show points in common. They are as familiar as a contemporary class picture from another school — the clothes and poses are familiar, but the faces are different.” Notable differ- ences extend from the distinct Far Northeast point forms such as the Ste. Anne, Cormier/Nicholas, and aforemen- tioned Debert style to the common presence in the earlier components of twist drills, pieces esquillees, and the like. It is plausible that the toolkit differences are to some extent explained by geographic isolation and consequently more limited east-to-west interaction patterns, perhaps due to the presence of physical geographic barriers such as the Champlain Sea, differences reinforced by the fact that little in the way of certain stone raw materials shows up in both areas — although the location of sites throughout the area, as along the north shore of the St. Lawrence, cer- tainly indicates that Paleoindians had watercraft. It is also plausible that these and other contrasts indicate differing adaptations in the two areas. Certainly, as the chapters in this volume clearly demonstrate, these early inhabitants of the Far Northeast were living in an area that contrasted in several respects with the Great Lakes. In some locations such as southern Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes, all evidence suggests to me that these peoples were living in true tundra environments at the northern edge of the area closer to the ice sheet; in Ontario the evidence still suggests that Paleoindians avoided those areas (Ellis 2002). They also, as the Rosenmeier et al. chapter in this volume makes abundantly clear, had to cope in at least part of the region with rapid and substantial environmental changes induced by the Younger Dryas climatic event, which apparently had more limited and less rapidly appearing consequences for Paleoindian peoples living elsewhere (Meltzer and Flolliday 2010) — including, although the exact extent of the effects is disputed, the Great Lakes (Ellis et al. 2011; Eren 2009). Several authors in this volume also suggest that these peoples were able to, and were, exploiting marine resources of the Champlain Sea, the lower reaches of the St. Law- rence River area, and, one presumes, the Atlantic coast. I remember being exposed to this idea by my first mentor, the late William Roosa, who talked of the possibility that the inhabitants of Bull Brook, Massachusetts, were hunting seals (he even suggested this in print: Roosa [1962:265]), but I was highly skeptical of this idea at the time. Later inves- tigators also began to raise this possibility (e.g., Keenlyside 1985:83-84). Although I would certainly love to see direct faunal evidence, I believe this idea is now on a much more plausible footing based on improved dating of the Cham- plain Sea, which makes it definitely contemporary with the Paleoindian occupation, and the recent models of the geographic and geological settings of the sites reported in this volume, notably at locations in Vermont and Quebec. Such a unique set for resources should have had an ef- fect on overall site locational preferences. In fact, I wonder if the ability and willingness to inhabit the more extreme environments or tundra areas closer to the ice sheets in the Far Northeast, but seemingly not in the Great Lakes, were due to the fact the far northeastern peoples could also ac- cess resources unavailable to the west, such as the marine resources. A greater abundance of resources might also explain why anyone entering the area from warmer, more southern climes would be attracted to these areas in the first place. The rarity of these early sites suggests that it was not population pressure that forced people into new, previously uninhabited, more marginal areas; unless one wants to as- sume that Paleoindian peoples simply had a wanderlust to explore new places (and they may have!), there had to be some attraction of these difficult-to-traverse areas with their extreme climates and lower inland carrying capacities. Researchers should be able to build on the foundation pro- vided by the contributions to this volume to explore these kinds of ideas in more detail in future studies. It is fair to note that some questions remain partly un- answered or controversial. I am certainly saying nothing Foreword xiii new here, for the same problems have been noted in com- mentaries in Paleoindian volumes and syntheses since ar- chaeological time immemorial (e.g., MacDonald 1971; Ma- son 1962; Wright 1989). One obvious one, hinted above, is the paucity of preserved faunal (and floral) remains. As is evident in this volume (e.g., F. Robinson; B. Robinson), the subsistence models we are currently developing and using, especially those concerning the role of caribou, are much more sophisticated than the simplistic, and rightly criticized (e.g., Dincauze 1988), models of the past that drew one to one analogies with whatever particular ethnographic group happened to strike one’s fancy. Nevertheless, although they may be more sophisticated and realistic, in the absence of substantial faunal recoveries the new models remain simply well-informed models. Another notable problem area revolves around questions concerning the absolute age of the sites, refined knowledge of which is basic to almost all archaeological interpretations. I used to think that we had a substantial foundation for our absolute age estimates of these occupations and especially when we had sites like Debert, with many fairly consistent radiocarbon dates; this suite of dates seemed to indicate that it was the best absolute-dated Paleoindian site in the East (e.g., Curran 1996:5-6; Ellis 2004). Flowever, as Rosenmeier et al. suggest in this volume, even the best dated actually may not be well dated, or, at least, there are several ways one can interpret the dates — and I believe the situation may be even more complicated than how they portray it. Of course, part of the problem is that radiocarbon dates during the late Pleistocene, and Younger Dryas in particular, vary because of changes in atmospheric carbon, and radiocarbon dates of the statistically same age may actually be separated by hundreds of sidereal years (“radiocarbon plateaus”). One can even get reversals at some points such that one gets older radiocarbon dates on what are actually younger sites (e.g., Curran 1996; Fiedel 1999). I am convinced, for example, that plateau effects account for the fact that we seem to have a huge number of distinct point types (Bull Brook/West Athens Flill, Michaud/Neponset, Crowfield, Cormier/ Nicholas) wedged into a narrow slice of radiocarbon time around 10,500-10,100 ''‘C yr BP. We need to be exceedingly careful in how we treat and use those dates, and we need to supplement them with other lines of evidence. This volume does shows that efforts to use the other lines of evidence are well under way, most notably via geochronological tech- niques and especially the distribution of sites in relation to old levels of the Champlain Sea and the upper St. Lawrence River area (Pintal, F. Robinson, this volume), and through the continuing development and use of refined point ty- pologies (Lothrop and Bradley, Spiess et ah, this volume). Well, all we can do is keep plugging away and hoping we find those Floly Grail sites with preserved fauna and flora, including charcoal suitable for dating, in undisturbed contexts. I am also hopeful that eventually we will begin to construct models and accumulate information that helps us to go beyond the more materialistic and pragmatic concerns of Paleoindian life such as subsistence practices. Perhaps, as Jess Robinson hints in his chapter, we may be able to one day speak of ideological aspects of Paleoindian peoples, of aspects such as their cosmological landscapes and how these perceptions may have influenced the colonization process and their use of space, a topic I find particularly fascinating, albeit difficult to deal with (Ellis 2009). Regardless, as this volume makes abundantly clear, studies in the Far North- east have come a long way even over the scholarly lifespan of this researcher, and I look forward to continuing progress in the coming decades.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Paleoindian archaeology calls for a multidisciplinary ap- proach, and most scholars work with a broad geographic scale to coincide with the adaptive nature of the late Ice Age hunting groups they study. Todays borders in the Far Northeast lose their significance in the face of the high mo- bility of these Paleoindian groups, which is visible in the long distances between sites and the primary lithic sources and is best illustrated by the use of Munsugun chert from northeastern Maine at the Bull Brook site in Massachusetts. It may be said that scholars working in the Far Northeast form a large family and that sharing information is rarely a problem. As an example, in 2002, while I was starting a long-term project in the Megantic Lake area, Richard Bois- vert paid me a visit and, after looking at the few tools and flakes from the Cliche-Rancourt site, told me with a wide smile that I might have a very early site. Over several years, he had encountered Early Paleoindian sites with a striking feature that he recognized at Cliche-Rancourt in 2002: the combined presence of New Flampshire rhyolite and red Munsungun chert. I already knew about the latter lithic source, but I did not know about the rhyolite from Jeffer- son or Mount Jasper. Dr. Boisvert’s sixth sense turned out to be right, for we found the first two of our fluted point fragments the following year. Collaboration was instrumental in the initial stages of our work at Megantic Lake, as it is now with this book. I would like to acknowledge all the contributors of this book. They are not just active in the field and at meetings; they are also willing to use their precious free time to produce knowledge in published form. It is time-consuming labor, taking a good share of our energy, but we all know that written words endure longer than pretty talks enhanced by witty one-liners. My sincere thanks go also to Christopher Ellis, who enthusiastically accepted the request to write a foreword to this volume. As a veteran of Great Lakes Paleo- indian studies, he was indeed a good choice, and his ability to accomplish this task in timely fashion is equal to his great generosity and willingness to share data with the Far Northeast family. Along with Kurt Carr, Dr. Ellis also acted as a reviewer, and their comments helped to broaden the scope of this book. They are both acknowledged here for the high quality of their constructive comments. This volume can be considered as the official admission of the province of Quebec to the unofficial “Clovis Club,” a lofty claim that requires some background. When I was dreaming about finding the first Early Paleoindian site in Quebec back in the early 1980s, I had the opportunity to dig one long weekend with Michael Gramly at the Vail site in Maine, near the Quebec border. Accompanied by David Keenlyside of the National Museum of Canada (now the Canadian Museum of Civilization), we uncovered a nice endscraper and several flakes while having the pleasure of working on this famous site. After that experience, I asked Mike if he would be interested in publishing in French, since he had new data collected after his 1982 publication. Fie accepted, and I seized the opportunity to look at the whole Paleoindian situation in southern Quebec, basi- cally to ask geographers to contribute to the physical and biological environment, to discuss the potential of finding fluted point sites, and to examine new data from late Paleo- indian sites. Following the publication of this special is- sue of Recherches amerindiennes au Quebec in 1985, the late Pierre Dumais organized another issue in 2002 in the same journal on Paleoindian questions from southern Ontario, the Maine-Maritime peninsula, and Quebec. The follow- ing year we found the first fluted point site in all of Que- bec. I freely admit that this discovery was an archaeologist’s dream come true. Flowever, it would have been impossible without the consent of M. Jean Cliche and Mme Catherine Rancourt, who let us invade their property and run our summer field school from 2001 to 2009. Their generosity is equal to the support they have given us all these years. XV XVI Acknowledgments and we will be working on the Cliche-Rancourt site for some time to come, combining small-scale research with the challenge of developing an interpretation center. This volume is in part the result of the long-term collab- oration between myself during a sabbatical leave from the Universite de Montreal, and Richard Boisvert, New Hamp- shire State archaeologist, who came to the Megantic Lake area almost every year with a group of volunteers to assist in various research aspects. It was Dr. Boisvert who made the suggestion to submit our manuscript to the Center for the Study of the First Americans. Given the reputation of this institution over the past twenty years, it was our idea to find a western publisher to build a more continental audience for Far Northeast archaeology and ecology. I thank series editor Michael Waters for his immediate enthusiasm for the project, and my gratitude also goes to Mary Lenn Dixon of Texas A&M University Press for having supported this venture through all the stages leading to publication. I hope that scholars working on the Paleoindian era in North America, and elsewhere, will find an interest in the diversity of these chapters on the Far Northeast. Clatide Chapdelaine Universite de Montreal CHAPTER I Introduction Toward the Consolidation of a Cultural and Environmental Framework Claude Chapdelaine and Richard A. Boisvert T he concept for Late Pleistocene Archaeology and Ecology in the Far Northeast derives from a long- term collaboration between the two of us and the desire to share the results of the past decade or so of research by the many active scholars addressing the Paleo- indian era in this region. The Far Northeast is not a new concept (Sanger and Renouf 2006); it refers to a large glaci- ated territory that holds a particular geographic and ecolog- ical position, affording it a distinct chapter in the peopling of North America. The Far Northeast is a peninsula incor- porating the six New England states, New York east of the Hudson, Quebec south of the St. Lawrence River and Gulf of St. Lawrence, plus the Maritime Provinces. This region was inhospitable before 13,500 years ago, especially in its northern latitudes. The fundamental issue for this volume focuses on the derivation of the Clovis pioneers from their eastward migration into the Far Northeast, who were dis- tinguished by the more numerous fluted point style form variations than previously thought (Bradley et al. 2008; Morrow and Morrow 1999, 2002). The archaeological record of the Far Northeast indicates that the area was probably settled slightly after 13,000 years ago. Several sites might apply to be among the oldest sites, but decisive data based on secure radiocarbon dates are still lacking (Bonnichsen and Will 1999; Gramly and Funk 1990). The contenders, on a logical basis, should be found in the western or southwestern portion of the Far North- east. Sites such as Bull Brook in Massachusetts, Whipple in New Hampshire, or several sites in southeastern New York were certainly among the early settlements. Although all these sites are not well dated independently with Arm ra- diocarbon assays, the fluted point styles from these sites are close to the older Clovis prototype that was the trademark between 13,500 and 12,800 years ago farther west and south. No clear association between the extinct fauna and human occupation has been recorded in the Far North- east, for few bones have been recovered so far. Although the proposition may seem tedious, caribou does seem to be the major prey, leading the majority of scholars to favor the caribou/ tundra model of settlement subsistence during the early days and in northern latitudes. Within this per- spective, the Vail site in Maine illustrates the Paleoindian capacity to explore and exploit a mountainous area around 12,500 years ago (Gramly 1982), and Debert in Nova Scotia (MacDonald 1968), dated to the same time range, could be the illustration of swift eastward mobility by Paleoindian hunters in relation to extensive caribou migration along a northeastern corridor. I 2 Chapdelaine and Boisvert The incentive of this book is to present new data and updates of some earlier interpretations. Among these, it is worth mentioning the synthesis provided for the early 1990s (Gramly and Funk 1990), revisited by others eight years later (Spiess et al. 1998; see also Spiess and Newby 2002). A lengthy foreword by the late James Petersen (2004) on the West Athens Flill Site, the Paleoindian period, and the contributions of Robert Funk is also of great relevance to grasp the accumulated knowledge on this early period of time. Still, there has not been a single book or article that makes a complete summary of the Paleoindian era for most of the Far Northeast. With this volume we attempt to ad- dress this need, admitting that our coverage is by no means complete. Of the Canadian provinces. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are not represented in this volume, since no discoveries have been made in the past decade al- though early human presence has been recorded previously (Keenlyside 1991). This book offers a new opportunity to review new data and interpretations in most areas of the Far Northeast, in- cluding a first glimpse at the only known fluted point site in Quebec, the Cliche-Rancourt site. Given the annual investigation of sites throughout the Far Northeast, the ac- cumulation of research findings has been steady, making it timely to present some of the most interesting results, changing our perception of this large area. The process of assembling this volume began when scholars were invited to participate in a symposium at the annual meeting of the Quebec Archaeological Associa- tion in Sherbrooke, May 1—3, 2009. All nine participants involved in Paleoindian archaeology or ecology agreed to transform their presentations into chapters for the pres- ent book.' After the Sherbrooke meeting, invitations were extended to additional colleagues who could fill key areas of the Far Northeast. The famous Debert site is now part of a cluster of sites, and a team led by Leah Rosenmeier agreed to contribute to this venture. Likewise, John Grock accepted our invitation to present an update on the Early Paleoindian occupation for the state of Vermont. A total of ten chapters along with this introduction are thus presented here, each presenting new data to the scientific community. Each chapter is unique, ranging from site description (Ghapdelaine) to site clusters (Rosenmeier et ah, Spiess et ah, Pintal), pedology (Gourchesne et ah), subregional synthesis (Boisvert, Grock and F. Robinson, Lothrop and Bradley), and specific problems such as the relationship with the Ghamplain Sea (F. Robinson) and the existence of a caribou drive near the Bull Brook Site (B. Robin- son). With reports incorporating Maine, New Flampshire, Vermont, eastern New York, Massachusetts, southeastern Quebec, and Nova Scotia, we feel that our coverage of the Far Northeast is adequate and hope that our efforts pro- vide food for thought and stimulate a new interest in areas where archaeological research is lacking. A collection of chapters covering such a vast territory could only be eclectic, which was the case for a comparable book on the Southeast (Anderson and Sassaman 1996), and we feel it is logical to present the regional syntheses first (part I), followed by specialized studies (part II). Ghapter 2, by Jonathan Lothrop and James Bradley on the Fludson Valley, covers the presumed territory from which specific groups may have entered the Far Northeast from the west, not excluding a southern entrance, and it might contain the most ancient sites of our study area. This chapter presents recent data and interpretations on Early and Middle Paleoindian lifeways during the late Pleistocene in the Mohawk/ Fludson drainage basin. It provides cur- rent perspectives on late Pleistocene landscapes of eastern New York, scenarios for human colonization, and aspects of settlement, subsistence adaptations, and technology. It is thus a starting chapter for studying the peopling of the Far Northeast. The state of Vermont was first in the Far Northeast to record a Paleoindian site, with the Reagan site (Ritchie 1953), but a long silence followed that is now broken by John Grock and Francis Robinson reporting an impressive set of new sites. In chapter 3 they challenge stereotypes by referring to Paleoindians located mostly along the Gham- plain Lake area as “Maritime Mountaineers” inhabiting the west coast of New England. A strong link can be made be- tween their vision and the one developed by Pintal’s chap- ter II on the Quebec Strait, emphasizing both an intimate relation between a site’s location and the Ghamplain Sea episode with its presumed marine biodiversity. This wel- come chapter describes the cultural affiliation, settlement type, content, and location of twenty-five recorded Paleo- Introduction 3 Indian sites and well-documented finds in Vermont for the purposes of understanding human colonization and early settlement in the region. The state of New Hampshire has also known a rapid increase in Paleoindian sites over the past fifteen years, and the synthesis provided by Richard Boisvert in chapter 4 is the first ever attempted while fieldwork and lab analysis are ongoing. It is thus not surprising that research con- ducted since 1996 has substantially enlarged the database for the state and contributed significantly to the region. This expansion is summarized and evaluated in this chap- ter. Patterns of site location within the state, evidence for behavior beyond the requirements of hunting, and indica- tions of complex interactions with other areas lead Boisvert to a more nuanced model of settlement. The Potter site, which is mentioned in the chapter, is definitely a key site, and much attention will be devoted to it in the coming years. The state of Maine has been making tremendous prog- ress since the discovery and publication of the Vail site in the early 1980s (Gramly 1982). In chapter 5, Arthur Spiess and his colleagues Ellen Cowie and Robert Bartone bring us to another level with an analysis of clusters. The authors mention the discovery of almost twenty Paleoindian sites in Maine in the past twenty years. Two clusters are dis- cussed in this chapter: Vail, and those associated with the Lewiston-Auburn airport. Styles of fluted points and range of raw materials used among various sites in a site cluster are examined to discuss the length of occupation and the range and variation in Paleoindian movement to and from each place. The seasonal aspect of Paleoindian settlement pattern is supported by this new recognition of successive occupations at specific areas. With this perspective in mind, several sites considered isolated in an area might be the start of new research to verify the existence of a cluster. A new contribution on a cluster of sites in the general area of the Debert site by a team of scholars led by Leah Morine Rosenmeier starts part II and the specialized stud- ies. With the support of Scott Buchanan, Ralph Stea, and Gordon Brewster, in chapter 6 Rosenmeier presents new evidence from several sites on soil, stratigraphy, and cul- tural content and discusses the implications on the dating and environmental conditions prevailing at the end of the Pleistocene. These new sites define a cluster that gives the region a new window into the past. The Gliche-Rancourt site reported in chapter 7 by Glaude Ghapdelaine is the single known site for the en- tire province of Quebec that could be assigned to the Early Paleoindian period on the basis of fluted points and other distinctive artifacts. The site has received much attention since 2003, after the first two fluted points were discovered, and 205 m^ have been dug so far. Pour loci were delim- ited and extensive research has been carried out on Areas i, 2, and 3. The 2009 field season confirmed that Area 4 was not occupied by fluted point makers, but the recognition of the new Area 5 in the southwestern portion of the site has given new breath for investigation. The chapter is limited to a detailed presentation of the first three areas. The tool assemblage is described, followed by a discussion on inter- nal organization and domestic activities. External relations with adjacent regions are explored within a broader per- spective with the implications of the Gliche-Rancourt site for our understanding of seasonal movements, adaptation, lithic acquisition, and cultural relations. The unusual presence of artifacts at depths ranging from 20 to 80 cm within the otherwise sterile orange sand layer below the spodic gray sand at Gliche-Rancourt led to the collaboration of Francois Gourchesne, pedologist, and his team to tackle this problem. The results of this study, given in chapter 8, question the mechanisms involved in this burying process. A polygenetic model of soil evolu- tion was used as the theoretical framework to facilitate the identification work of pedogenetic processes, in particular, pedoturbation. This approach has helped to retrace the soil evolution since ice retreat and suggested the central impor- tance of cryoturbation and bioturbation as major mecha- nisms in the burying of artifacts at the Gliche-Rancourt archaeological site. Ghapter 9, on Bull Brook, by Brian Robinson is part of a quest to understand a settlement pattern represented by a single organized event with thirty-six activity loci, along with the economic strategy to allow this important social aggregation. The hypothesis developed here stresses the importance of a lowstand of the changing sea level east of Bull Brook, favoring the emergence of Jeffreys Ledge, a drowned maritime island that may have provided abun- 4 Chapdelaine and Boisvert dance, predictability, and landscape characteristics suitable for communal caribou drives. The location of Bull Brook could have been related to this late ephemeral Pleistocene landscape. Chapter to, by Francis Robinson IV, on Vermont is a much needed update on the exact relationship between the Champlain Sea episode and the known Paleoindian sites. The location of the Reagen site, a multicomponent Paleo- indian site, near the expected sea shoreline or altitude tends to support the chronological framework based on fluted point forms developed recently (Bradley et al. 2008). Mod- els of the inception and duration of the Champlain Sea have been revised significantly over the past decade, and the Paleoindian presence in Vermont is now considered coeval. The biodiversity of the late Pleistocene body of water brings a new perspective to discussions of Paleoindian settlement patterns and subsistence dominated by the caribou model. In chapter ii, Jean- Yves Pintal presents a series of chal- lenging sites found in the Quebec City area that are pro- viding us with a unique view of the end of fluted point manufacture and its transition into something else. The inception and evolution of the Champlain Sea episode in the Strait of Quebec are the necessary general background for understanding human occupations in the area. The basic chronology suffers from a lack of radiocarbon dates for these oldest sites, but an Early Archaic site dated to 9000 ''‘C yr BP with a quartz assemblage is providing a solid upper limit for the Paleoindian period. The tool as- semblage of these oldest sites in the Quebec City area shows resemblance to the Cormier/Nicholas point style, and it should be older than the Early Archaic site. The spatial dis- tribution of these sites between 11,300 and 8800 years ago indicates a rather smooth change in the exploitation of the territory, starting with a tendency to occupy the same sites and later moving to a wider range of environments. The chapters of this volume have much in common, but one source is especially pivotal. This is “Whafs the Point? Modal Forms and Attributes of Paleoindian Bifaces in the New England-Maritimes Region,” by James Bradley, Ar- thur Spiess, Richard Boisvert, and Jeff Boudreau, published in the Archaeology of Eastern North America in 2008. Prior to its publication, researchers in the Northeast had to rely on external references to define and discuss the essential diagnostic artifacts of the region. The purpose of the study was “to propose a set of definitions for the Paleoindian bi- faces currently known within the New England-Maritimes Region ... to provide a clearly defined set of working terms to facilitate comparisons and test hypotheses.” (Bradley et al. 2008:119). These authors then set out to define the modalities of the Paleoindian bifaces metrically, stylisti- cally, and geographically with a (partial) goal of clarifying the chronological and cultural parameters, thus offering a point of departure for future research. In a brief period of time this work has become a standard reference in Paleo- indian studies. In a sense, this publication was a watershed event and represented a coming of age for the study of the Paleoindian era for the region. Its authors intended it to be used and tested as a tool, and one can judge its utility by its application in the chapters of this volume. Another aspect touched on regularly in this volume is the importance of channel flakes (see Boisvert 2008). This particular type of artifact is mostly associated with the final stage of fluted point production. Channel flakes obtained from the final fluting process, nearly always as fragments, exhibit short truncated flake scars on their exterior that meet to form a central ridge parallel to the direction of force that removed the flake. These flakes are the product of the manufacture of the longitudinal grooves that are the diagnostic feature of Paleoindian fluted points. The specificity of our geographic area is also worth mentioning. Recently, the impact of the Younger Dryas on North American Paleoindians has been challenged (Melt- zer and Floliday 2010). If the impact seems to have been less severe in various parts of the continent, it was stressed that Paleoindians may have noticed climate changes in the Northeast (Newby et al. 2005). We can confirm that state- ment for the Far Northeast, which is a good example of extreme human adaptation at northern latitudes. Other aspects make this eclectic volume thought pro- voking. Most chapters are concerned with settlement pat- terns and various recurrent themes such as high mobility expressed through an impressive lithic network including Fludson Valley chert to the west and Munsungun chert in northeastern Maine, seasonal caribou adaptation, as well as site locations and chronology. Site formation processes and the meaning of multilocus sites are other aspects discussed by several authors. The radiocarbon-dating of North American Paleoindian Introduction 5 sites is one of its most challenging issues. Unfortunately, the Far Northeast is no exception, and problems such as the plateau effect (Fiedel 1999), lack of hearths with charcoal and bone, and the calibration curve with substantial differ- ences between calendar and radiocarbon years still apply. This dating problem places the Paleoindian era in a con- stant debate. Although radiocarbon dating is instrumen- tal to our discipline, its limited utility is not contributing significantly to the emerging point typology. It is with no surprise that the point typology is now the major chrono- logical tool, a situation similar to that in the Great Lakes (Ellis and Deller 1997). The geographic scope of this collaborative effort to bring together the existing data on the Paleoindian era at the end of the Pleistocene in the Far Northeast, though stressing the importance of environmental conditions (see Newby et al. 2005), is far from exhaustive. Still, this book should be helpful for at least a decade or more, depending on the dynamism of the field and its actors. It will thus be a basic reference for scholars interested in Paleoindian studies, the search for the First Americans, and comparisons with other areas of North America. It is our hope that in future com- parative analyses the Far Northeast plays an active role and is not relegated to the background. NOTE I. Unfortunately, the team led by Pierre J. H. Richard, in- cluding Alayn C. Larouche, Tamylia Elkadi, and Nicole Morasse of the Universite de Montreal, was not able to meet the deadline for the book. Their paper was highly complementary to the chapters by Chapdelaine and by Courchesne et al. as well as hav- ing strong implications for the Far Northeast, with the detailed environmental reconstruction of southeastern Quebec and sur- rounding areas. Palynologically controlled radiocarbon ages are suggesting the maintenance of a tundra for a longer time period than previously thought and giving more support to a seasonal settlement subsistence pattern based on barren-ground caribou (see Chapdelaine, this volume).

Part I Regional Syntheses CHAPTER II Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley, New York Jonathan C. Lothrop and James W. Bradley M uch of our current perspective on late Pleisto- cene adaptations in New York stems directly from work by former state archaeologist Wil- liam A. Ritchie and his successor, Robert E. Funk. For five decades, their investigations defined the research frame- work for late Pleistocene occupations of eastern New York. In so doing, their research influenced interpretations of Paleoindian lifeways in glaciated regions that extend be- yond New York, including the eastern Great Fakes, New England, and the Canadian Maritimes. In recent years, new information has come to light on the environmental setting and landscape evolution of late Pleistocene New York, providing a better basis for under- standing the physical contexts for postglacial human colo- nization after circa 13,000 cal BP. As well, new insights (and persistent questions) on systematics and chronology cast a different light on published data for Paleoindian sites and point finds in New York (Bradley et al. 2008; Fothrop et al. 2011). Coupled with recent discoveries and analyses, this allows us to reconsider what we think we know about how the late Pleistocene peoples colonized, and then adapted to, the dynamic deglacial landscapes of eastern New York. In this review we discuss (i) late Pleistocene landscapes. (2) scenarios for human colonization, and (3) Paleoindian settlement, subsistence, and technology for the Hudson Valley and vicinity. We also consider possible roles of the Hudson Valley and the Champlain lowlands in peopling of the Far Northeast. Our geographic focus on eastern New York includes the Mohawk-Hudson drainage basin, adja- cent upland provinces, and, to a lesser extent, the Cham- plain Basin. To complement this study area, we also draw on data from adjoining regions. In particular, we consider the eastern New York data in relation to the broader glacial landscapes extending north and east, collectively referred to elsewhere as the New England-Maritimes (Bradley et al. 2008; Fothrop et al. 2011; Spiess et al. 1998) but referenced in this volume as the Far Northeast. As we discuss below, most site-based evidence for Paleo- indian occupation in eastern New York consists of early fluted point occupations, by default defining our primary focus. Our chronological framework relies on Bradley et al. (2008), distinguishing Early Paleoindian, Middle Paleo- indian, and Fate Paleoindian over the time span of circa 12,900-10,000 cal BP. Unless otherwise noted, all age and date references are based on calibrated radiocarbon dates and calendar years before present (Fiedel 1999). 9 10 Lothrop and Bradley LATE PLEISTOCENE LANDSCAPES IN EASTERN NEW YORK Physiography, Geology, Drainage Figure 2.1 illustrates physiographic regions of New York (Cadwell et al. 2003). Areas of higher elevation in eastern sectors of the state include the Appalachian Plateau, Ad- irondack Highlands, and Taconic Mountains, all underlain by rock units more resistant to erosion. Known region- ally as the Southern Tier of New York, the Appalachian Plateau is made up of Devonian limestones, shales, sand- stones, and conglomerate. The Onondaga Escarpment and its chert-bearing limestones extend west-to-east across the midsection of the state. Highly metamorphosed rocks of the Middle Proterozoic — gneisses, quartzites, and marbles — make up the Adirondack Highlands in northern New York. To the east, the Taconic Mountains are composed of meta- morphosed Cambrian through Middle Ordovician rocks, including sandstones, shales, and slates. Most of the lowland provinces in New York and west- ern Vermont are made up of limestones, shales, sandstones, and dolostones; erosion and glacial scouring created ter- rains of modest relief that transect the New York region. In prehistory, the Erie-Ontario, Hudson-Mohawk, and St. Lawrence-Champlain lowlands offered broad travel corridors for human and animal populations skirting the Appalachian Plateau and Adirondack Highlands. To the southeast. Long Island marks the Terminal Moraine and lies within the Atlantic Coastal Lowlands province. The Hudson River is the master stream for eastern New York. Draining 36,000 km^, the Hudson runs south from its source on Mount Marcy in the Adirondacks for 507 km to its mouth in New York Bay. The east-flowing Mohawk and Wallkill river tributaries provided entry for humans into the Hudson Valley from points west; the west-flowing Hoosic and Battenkill rivers led eastward (upstream) from the Hudson Valley into the rest of the Far Northeast. Deglacial Chronology and Events As the Pleistocene drew to a close, the face of eastern New York was dramatically reshaped by glacial retreat, sea level rise, isostatic rebound, massive drainage diversions, and the formation and draining of proglacial and inland marine water bodies (Bloom 2008; Cronin et al. 2008; Donnelly et al. 2005; Rayburn et al. 2005; Richard and Occhietti 2005; Ridge 2003; Stanford 2009; Teller 2004). Current chronologies suggest that many of these events transpired only centuries before Paleoindian colonization. In New York, the Late Wisconsin advance of the Laurentide ice sheet reached its southern terminus circa 28,000-24,000 cal BP, creating the massive terminal moraine of Long Island. Ice margin retreat from this po- sition began about 24,000 cal BP (Ridge 2003; Stanford 2009), a process that was periodically interrupted by glacial 2.1. Physiographic regions of New York (after Cadwell et al. 2003). Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley II readvances, forming smaller end moraines farther north. By circa 15,500 cal BP, the glacial margin had retreated 250 km northward up the Hudson Valley to near present-day Al- bany. Thereafter, the pace of ice withdrawal across New York accelerated, with final retreat into Quebec by circa 13,100 cal BP (Donnelly et al. 2005; Richard and Occhietti 2005; Ridge 2003). During this final deglaciation of eastern New York, meltwaters pooled behind the retreating ice front in the Hudson and its tributary valleys, trapped by morainal ridges on the isostatically depressed landscape. Large and small proglacial lakes formed and drained, their shoreline footprints fluctuating in response to changes in meltwater input, outlet elevations, and isostatic rebound. Although a general sequence of proglacial lakes in the Hudson Valley is known, chronological control is poor, and rough dates are often available only for either the inception or draining of some lakes. After these proglacial lakes formed, clay to silt-size sediments settled out on their bottoms, and feeder streams constructed deltas where they discharged into these water bodies. (In some cases, geologists have con- ferred more than one name for a particular proglacial lake with multiple stages in the Hudson valley; for simplicity, we follow Stanfords [2009:7] Lake Albany designation for proglacial water bodies that occupied the Hudson Valley bottom south of Fort Ann). After final draining of these proglacial lakes, streams dissected the lake bed sediments, and winds eroded exposed deltaic sediments, creating local- ized dune fields (Bloom 2008; Stanford 2009). During initial ice retreat up the lower Hudson Valley between about 24,000 and 17,000 cal BP, small progla- cial lakes Bayonne, Passaic, and Hackensack formed and drained in an overlapping sequence west of the Hudson Valley bottom (Stanford 2009:7-8). To the northwest, glacial retreat from the tributary Wallkill valley formed Lake Wallkill — a proglacial lake contemporary with earlier stages of Lake Albany (Stanford 2009:14). Beginning about 22,500 cal BP, Stanford (2009:8) sug- gests, early Lake Albany was restricted to the lower Hudson, with a stable spillway outlet at Hell Gate, flowing eastward along the north side of Staten Island into what is now Long Island Sound. Thereafter, the location and size of Lake Al- bany’s footprint fluctuated as it migrated upvalley, even- tually reaching its northern limit near Glens Falls, east of the Adirondacks (figure 2.2B) (Gadwell and Muller 2004; Gadwell et al. 2003; Dineen et al. 1992). The total foot- print of Lake Albany through time extended circa 320 km (515 miles) from the Narrows upstream to Glens Falls, with a maximum width of 50 km (80 miles) near Albany (fig- ure 2.3). During specific stages, however, the extent of the lake’s footprint was significantly smaller. Over its lifespan, as new outlets opened, water levels in Lake Albany dropped to successive lower levels, with these later lake stages becoming more fluvial or riverlike (DeSimone 1992). Stanford (2009:14) proposes that, as the footprint of Lake Albany migrated northward up the Hud- son Valley, declining water levels combined with isostatic rebound to the south exposed the former lake bed in the lower Hudson Valley. Beginning about 17,500 cal BP, the northward-shifting outlet of Lake Albany began incising the emerging lake bed downstream, creating the modern course of the lower Hudson River. Dineen (1982:3) suggests a date of 12,600 '^G yr BP (ca.14,800 cal BP) for the final draining of Lake Albany, although this approximation is likely too old. As ice withdrew up the Hudson Valley, the postglacial Atlantic shoreline of the New York region retreated at vari- able rates. At circa 18,300 cal BP, sea level lay 150 m lower than today, with the coastline near the outer edge of the continental shelf at the “Nicholls” shoreline position (ca. 208 km, or 130 miles, southeast of Staten Island) (Stanford 2009:Figure 2.3B). This broad exposed plain on the conti- nental shelf was bisected by the southeast-trending course of the late glacial Hudson Valley. Between circa 18,300 cal BP and the end of the Pleistocene at circa 11,600 cal BP, regional isostatic rebound in southeastern New York nearly equaled eustatic sea level rise, resulting in only marginal landward retreat of New York’s Atlantic coastline (see fig- ure 2.2A). After 11,600 cal BP, sea level rise began to outpace isostatic rebound, resulting in more rapid transgression and drowning of the lowermost Hudson Valley (Stanford 2009:9-10, Figure 2.5). Northwest of the Hudson Valley, ice retreat from the Ontario basin after 16,200 cal BP created proglacial Lake Iroquois along the southern margin of the ice front. With meltwater input from other Great Lakes basins to the west. Lake Iroquois continued to expand, eventually exceeding the footprint of modern Lake Ontario (see figure 2.2A). 12 Lothrop and Bradley 2.2.

Glacial Lake Albany in eastern New York (A) Maximum footprints of proglacial lakes Iroquois and Albany; at circa 13,400 cal (after Cadwell et al. 2003). BP, retreat of Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) ice margin from the Covey Hill Gap along the northern Adirondacks reroutes drainage from the Mohawk Valley to lower-elevation outlets, draining Lake Iroquois through the St. Lawrence, Champlain, and Hudson lowlands. (B) Circa 13,100-13,000 cal BP, continued ice retreat opens the St. Lawrence Valley, and the Atlantic Ocean floods the Champlain Basin, forming the Champlain Sea. Numbered routes illustrate possible corridors for Paleoindian colonization of eastern New York. A northern corridor (i) runs east along Erie-Ontario lowlands into eastern New York (2, 3). A southern corridor (4) trends northeasterly via the Upper Susquehanna or Delaware and Wallkill valleys to the Hudson Valley (5, 6) (after Brad- ley 1998:15; Newby and Bradley 2007:Figure i). Sometime between 14,600 and 13,800 cal BP, final ice re- treat from the Mohawk Valley opened an outlet for progla- cial Lake Iroquois near Rome, New York, routing meltwater via the ancestral IroMohawk River into later, lower stages of Lake Albany in the Hudson Valley (Ridge 2003; Stanford 2009:12; Wall 2008). Wall (2008) calculates astonishing maximum flow rates of at least 42,500 m^ per second (1.5 million cubic feet per second) (cfs) down the IroMohawk Valley for perhaps one to three centuries before the Lake Iroquois outlet shifted to the St. Lawrence drainage circa 13,400 cal BP (see below). This estimated flow rate is 275 times greater than the average flow rate today for the mod- ern Mohawk River (154 m^ per second, or 5,440 cfs)(USGS 2010). At the IroMohawk— ancestral Hudson River conflu- ence, these turbulent floodwaters stripped away glacial till and proglacial lake sediment, cutting massive potholes into bedrock (Hall 1871; Wall 2008:17-18). In 1867 construction workers discovered the Cohoes mastodon in one of these glacial potholes. AMS dating of this mastodon yielded an age of 11,070 ± 60 '\"‘C yr BP (12,930-13,050 cal BP), pro- viding “a minimum age for pothole exposure following a drop in high water discharge during the drainage of Lake Iroquois” (Miller 2008b). Reflecting these events, surficial geology in the Hudson Valley consists of mostly glacial till on higher elevations and proglacial lake bed sediments in valley bottoms (Cadwell and Dineen 1987). In addition, coarse deltaic sediments deposited on the margins of Lake Albany became exposed sandy plains as the lake drained (Cadwell and Muller 2004; Cadwell et al. 2003), and prevailing winds reworked these Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley 13 sandy deposits into dune fields (Dineen 1975, 1982; Dineen and Hansen 1983; Donahue 1977). Today, the largest of these relic dune fields lies between Albany and Schenectady, New York, where the IroMohawk River fed higher, early stages of proglacial Lake Albany. This dune field landscape is variously known as the Albany Dunes, the Capitol Dunes Complex, or, reflecting the xeric vegetation it hosts, simply the Pine Bush. At about 13,400 cal BP, ice retreat from the northern margin of the Adirondacks at Covey Hill opened a succes- sion of lower outlets for proglacial Lake Iroquois, shifting outflow from the Mohawk Valley to the St. Lawrence Valley (see figure 2.2A). Waters discharging from Lake Iroquois were rerouted northeasterly around the Adirondacks, south into proglacial Lake Vermont in the Champlain Basin, and finally down the Hudson Valley to the Atlantic (Donnelly et al. 2005; Rayburn et al. 2007; Stanford 2009). Waters in the Ontario Basin dropped 90-100 m below modern levels to early Lake Ontario, a low stage with a footprint smaller than modern Lake Ontario (Anderson and Lewis 1985). Rayburn et al. (2005) and Thieler et al. (2007) propose that this drainage rerouting to the St. Lawrence, and subsequent drops in the Fort Ann outlet at the south end of Lake Ver- mont, released two flood pulses of meltwater (volumes es- timated at 570 km^, 130 km^) into Lake Vermont and down the Hudson Valley. The precise timing of these events is uncertain but most likely transpired between 13,400 and 13,100 cal BP. Depending on duration as well as aggregate volumes, these outflow pulses could have caused catastrophic flooding on a gigantic scale down the Hudson Valley, further scouring the ancestral Hudson River channel. Circa 13,100-13,000 cal BP, with final ice retreat north of the St. Lawrence Valley, the Atlantic Ocean flooded the isostatically depressed St. Lawrence and Champlain lowlands, marking the end of proglacial Lake Vermont in the Champlain Basin and creating the Champlain Sea (see figure 2.2B) (Cronin et al. 2008; Rayburn et al. 2005; Rayburn, personal communication, 2008; Richard and Oc- chietti 2005; Rodrigues 2006). At its maximum extent, this vast inland sea stretched 600 km (375 miles) east-west be- tween Ontario and Quebec and 300 km (185 miles) south from Quebec into the Champlain Basin of eastern New York and western Vermont, dwarfing modern Lake Cham- plain. With isostatic rebound, the footprint of the Cham- plain Sea shrank through time and was cut off from the Atlantic Ocean at about 9800-9700 cal BP (Cronin et al. 2008). Importantly, by this current chronology the Cham- plain Sea overlapped the Paleoindian occupation of eastern New York and thus could have factored into regional Paleo- indian subsistence and land use practices. Late Pleistocene Paleoenvironment and Fauna While dramatic deglacial events were fundamentally re- shaping postglacial landscapes of eastern New York, re- gional late Pleistocene climates were also in flux, reflected by dynamic changes in vegetation as plant and tree com- munities recolonized the region after ice retreat and in response to subsequent climate changes. Beginning circa 14,700 cal BP, a general warming trend is indicated dur- ing the Bolling-Allerod interval. Over the next 1,400 years, both boreal and temperate forest species established them- selves in the deglaciated middle and lower Hudson Valley of New York (Miller 2008a). Between about 12,900 and 11,600 cal BP, a climatic reversal known as the Younger Dryas took place, with a sudden return to colder temperatures and decreased pre- cipitation in the Canadian Maritimes and New England (Peteet et al. 1993). In east-central New York, mean annual temperatures were 5-10° C colder than present, similar to the modern climate of central Quebec (Miller 20o8b:23). Paleoenvironmental data for the Far Northeast indicate that plant and tree communities responded quickly (perhaps one to two centuries ) to the onset of the Younger Dryas climatic reversal, but that these vegetation changes varied across the region (Maenza-Gmelch 1997; Miller 2008a, 2008b; Newby et al. 2005; Lothrop et al. 2011:550-551; Pe- teet et al. 1993; Shuman et al. 2002, 2004; Toney et al. 2003). In the Maritimes, tundra partly replaced spruce forests. In southern New England, boreal forest taxa (spruce, fir, and occasionally alder or birch) became more common at the expense of deciduous species like oak and ash (Newby et al. 2005; Shuman et al. 2002). In the middle-lower Hudson Valley of New York and northern New Jersey, spruce, balsam fir, and alder increased in abundance, consistent with cooler and drier conditions (Miller 2008b). Miller (20o8b:23) suggests that during the Younger Dryas the middle-lower 14 Lothrop and Bradley Hudson Valley included both open and more closed forests, suggesting landscapes with mosaic-like vegetation patterns. The end of the Younger Dryas at circa ii,6oo cal BP was marked by abrupt warming and even drier conditions, re- flected by newfound dominance of pine and oak species. In eastern New York, discoveries of postglacial fossils highlight a rich record of late Pleistocene terrestrial fauna, some of which persisted until Paleoindian entry into the region (e.g., Feranec and Kozlowski 2010; Funk and Stead- man 1994; Hartnagel and Bishop 1922; Thompson et al. 2008). Most spectacular of these are proboscidea (American mastodon and Columbian mammoth), along with ungu- lates (caribou, stag-moose, and muskox) and other mam- mals (giant beaver, flat-headed peccary). Robinson and Burney (2008:298) place the extinction of mastodon and mammoth in New York State at or shortly after circa 11,000 ‘'‘C yr BP (12,945 cal BP). Radiocarbon dates for mastodon fossils at the Hiscock site in Genesee County, western New York, range from 11,033 ± 4° to 10,515 ± 120 ‘'‘C yr BP (Laub 2003:71). At two sigma using Calib 6.1, these dates yield age ranges of 12,724-13,091 cal BP and 12,053-12,649 cal BP for the oldest and young- est mastodon dates at Hiscock. In western New York this would delimit mastodon extinction or extirpation to sometime after 12,053-12,649 cal BP, suggesting that Paleo- indians and mastodons coexisted for several centuries in the New York region. Discovery of fossil flsh scales in a pollen core from Al- lamuchy Pond, northern New Jersey, documents the late Pleistocene presence of flsh populations in the upper Dela- ware Valley (Daniels and Peteet 1998; Peteet et al. 1993). Scales of sucker in sediment dated 12,260 ± 220 ''‘C yr BP (two sigma calibration of 13,730-15,094 cal BP, Calib 6.1) and of trout, sunflsh, and yellow perch dated 10,740 ± 420 '^C yr BP (12,406-12,929 cal BP) show that these spe- cies colonized this pond within centuries after the onset of organic deposition, presumably from late glacial refugia in the Coastal Plain and Atlantic Ocean. Similar scenarios can be envisioned for eastern New York. Finally, together with possible marine resources along New York’s since-drowned late Pleistocene Atlantic coast, the Champlain Sea supported a diverse marine fauna (see below) (Franzi et al. 2010; Harrington 1988; McAllister et al. 1988; Steadman et al. 1994). Regional Toolstone Sources in Prehistory Primary, bedded sources of toolstone used in prehistory by Native Americans outcrop across discrete sectors of the New York region (Funk 2004; Holland 2004). These in- clude both Devonian and Ordovician chert-bearing forma- tions; the most extensive outcrops consist of chert-bearing Devonian limestones along the Onondaga and Helderberg escarpments, fronting the northern and eastern margins of the Appalachian Plateau in New York (Fisher et al. 1970). Investigations of the Potts and Corditaipe sites in central and eastern New York document exploitation of these sources during the late Pleistocene (Funk and Wellman 1984; Gramly and Lothrop 1984; Lothrop 1989). Members of the Ordovician Normanskill Group — the Mount Merino and Indian River formations — are mapped together discontinuously through the upper and middle Hudson Valley from Washington County southward into Dutchess County (Fisher et al. 1970). The Mount Merino Formation yields cherts ranging from green to black, and outcrops of the Indian River Formation may also contain green cherts (Fisher 1977; Landing 1988, 2007; Landing et al. 1992). Archaeological and geological investigations at the Greene County outcrops of West Athens Hill, Scott Farm Quarry, and Flint Mine Hill variously document mining and reduction of Normanskill chert from Paleo- indian through later prehistoric times in the mid-Hudson Valley (e.g., Brumbach 1987; Burke 2006; Funk 1973, 2004; Parker 1924; Robinson et al. 2009), and fleldwork in Washington County reveals outcrops of this toolstone in the upper Hudson Valley as well (Holland and Ashton 1999). There may well be other, unrecorded outcrops in the Hudson Valley of this important toolstone source that were exploited by Paleoindians. For the Wallkill Valley of southeastern New York and adjoining New Jersey, LaPorta (1996) and Holland (2004) describe Lower Ordovician chert-bearing formations that Native Americans mined for toolstone through much of prehistory. LaPorta (1996:73-74) notes the presence of eight different chert-bearing members in southern exten- sions of the Beekmantown Group in northern New Jersey. Surface finds (Lake 2003) and investigation of the Zappa- vigna site by Funk et al. (2003:16) indicate Paleoindian use of several Wallkill Valley chert sources, including the Epler and Ontelaunee formations. Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley 15 In eastern Pennsylvania, jasper in the Hardyston Forma- tion was mined by Native Americans throughout prehis- tory (Flatch 1994). Paleoindians appear to have transported this toolstone from quarries in Berks, Lehigh, and Bucks counties to sites in the Susquehanna and Delaware drain- ages of Pennsylvania (Carr and Adovasio 2002:21-23; Carr and McLearen 2005; Fogelman and Lantz 2006; Flatch and Maxham 1995; Lothrop et al. 2008). The likely additional presence of eastern Pennsylvania jasper in Paleoindian site collections in the upper Susquehanna and Fludson valleys of New York strongly suggests that Paleoindians imported this toolstone to the region during seasonal travels (Funk 1993:174, 2004; Ritchie 1957; Whitney 1977). This notion is consistent with sourcing analysis that links jasper at the Bull Brook Paleoindian site in Massachusetts to eastern Pennsylvania sources (Robinson et al. 2009). COLONIZING EASTERN NEW YORK: TIMING, ROUTES, AND RESOURCES Chronological Control The scarcity of reliable radiocarbon dates for Paleoindian sites in northeastern North America has led archaeologists to formulate biface sequences for relative chronological control. For the eastern Great Lakes, researchers have de- veloped a sequence of Early (fluted) and Late (nonfluted lanceolate) Paleoindian bifaces (Deller and Ellis 1988; Ellis 2004a, 2004b; Ellis and Deller 1990, 1997; Jackson 2004; Simons 1997; White 2006). For fully fluted forms, the relative ordering is Gainey-Barnes-Crowfleld (table 2.1), with Simons (1997) further suggesting that Butler points are transitional between Gainey and Barnes forms. In this formulation, Gainey is viewed as oldest based on greater similarity to Clovis forms. Late Paleoindian point forms include basally thinned Flolcombe and Fli-Lo forms fol- lowed by nonfluted, lanceolate points. Building on Spiess et al. (1998), Bradley et al. (2008) proposed a similar point sequence for the Far Northeast, spanning a suggested time interval of 12,900-10,000 cal BP for this sequence. Kings Road/Whipple forms are most similar to Clovis bifaces and therefore likely oldest in this series. For fully fluted bifaces in this sequence, trends through time include decreasing basal width and maxi- mum thickness, increasing face angle (divergence of lateral margins), and increasing flute length (similar to trends in the eastern Great Lakes). As illustrated in table 2.1, Brad- ley et al. (2008) proposed Early Paleoindian and Middle Paleoindian subdivisions for fluted biface forms. Reflecting a shift to nonfluted bifaces after the Younger Dryas, Late Paleoindian forms include lanceolate Agate Basin-related and Ste. Anne/Varney bifaces (Bradley et al. 2008; Newby et al. 2005). Gramly (2008, 2009) proposes an alternate Paleoindian biface sequence for much of eastern North America, includ- ing southeastern New York. Fie suggests that Cumberland points in the Southeast and Great Lakes Barnes points pre- date Clovis, and that Folsom and Crowfleld forms derive directly from Clovis. Gramly reviews the five fluted bifaces Table 2.1.

Of these five fluted points, we are uncertain about the fragmentary tip specimens but note that metric attributes for the two specimens with surviving basal seg- ments — the complete fluted point (NYSM A2001.17.001) and the basal fragment (NYSM A74952.001) — fall within the range of variability for Michaud/Neponset forms in the Far Northeast (Bradley et al. 2008:141-146). Why Colonize New York? Why colonize eastern New York at the end of the Pleisto- cene? Most theoretical and regional models of Paleoindian colonization are ultimately resource driven. Foraging theory suggests incentives for human colonization of adjoining re- gions in an evolving late Pleistocene deglacial environment organized in a mosaic (as opposed to zonal) pattern (e.g.. Barton et al. 2004). For example, patch choice models pre- dict that colonizers to a new region focus on high-ranking resources such as megafauna (made more feasible by a pre- adapted hunting technology; Kelly and Todd 1988). Over time, population growth of foraging groups and depletion of prey species encourage groups to move into uninhab- ited regions nearby — an example of short-distance colo- nization of adjoining regions based on range shift (Spiess et al. 1998:247). Long-distance colonization may have also figured in this process, perhaps driven by other factors and relying on migration via major valley corridors, possibly moving out from ecologically rich zones (Anderson 1990; Anderson and Gillam 2000; Dincauze 1993). For eastern New York and the Fludson Valley, a range of resources could have drawn Paleoindian explorers into the region. These included toolstone; eastern New York har- bored good-quality cherts in Fludson Valley outcrops of the Ordovician Normanskill group and in Devonian forma- tions along the east-facing Flelderberg Escarpment. The New York region also contained a variety of late Pleistocene fauna as potential prey — including caribou and mastodon — that overlapped human occupation of the region, before extinction or extirpation (Laub and Spiess 2003; Newby and Bradley 2007). Newby et al. (2005) ar- gue that vegetation changes in the Far Northeast at the Younger Dryas onset (more open conditions to the north and southward-shifting spruce forests) created habitats fa- vorable to local and long-range migratory herds of caribou. Dincauze and Jacobson (2001) point to migratory water- fowl populations in the late Pleistocene as potential food resources, especially where early postglacial lake shorelines intersected Atlantic flyways. Perhaps the largest resource draw for the New York region in the late Pleistocene, the Champlain Sea likely formed only a century or two before human colonization of New York. Loring (1980) suggested that the Champlain Sea contained marine resources attractive to Paleoindian populations, a notion receiving renewed support (Newby and Bradley 2007; F. Robinson, this volume). Discoveries of fossil remains in the former footprint of the Champlain Sea reveal a rich marine fauna inhabiting this vast inland sea that fronted northeastern New York, including five species of whales, four species of seals, more than ten fish species, and shorebirds (Franzi et al. 2010; Flarrington 1988; McAl- lister et al. 1988; Steadman et al. 1994). Fossils of saltwater fish species suggest coastal marine habitats comparable to southern Labrador today (McAllister et al. 1988:243). Renewed consideration of how prehistoric peoples may have colonized uninhabited landscapes, particularly in late Pleistocene North America (e.g., Flaynes 2002:239—262; Meltzer 2002, 2004; Rockman and Steele 2003), highlights the critical human strategies of “wayfinding” and “land- scape learning.” From ethnographic data on how hunter- gatherers use landscapes, Kelly (2003:54) suggests that way- finding through an unknown landscape was probably made easier and less risky by piloting between landmarks along easily traceable geographic features — most obviously major rivers, but also mountain ranges or other linear ecological margins. Conversely, landscapes lacking topographic re- lief or major waterways would have been more difficult to navigate and internalize and therefore were perhaps avoided initially. These notions mesh well with Paleoindian colonization scenarios. Building on Bradley (1998), Newby and Brad- ley (2007) offer a detailed model of colonization scenarios, suggesting “northern” and “southern” corridors into eastern New York and the broader region (see figure 2.2B). Paleoindian populations could have entered New York Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley 17 2.4.

Abandoned before 13,000 cal BP, these relict low-relief channels could have provided pathways for movement across New York for colonizing and later Paleoindian populations (DEM imagery courtesy of Andrew Kozlowski). from the west, perhaps from the Ohio Valley, following a northern route eastward between the Onondaga escarp- ment and early Lake Ontario (see figure 2.2B, i). Travel- ing east along the Lake Ontario Plain, Paleoindians could have followed the Cross-State Channels (Kehew et al. 2009; Kozlowski and Pair 2007; A. Kozlowski, personal communication, 2008) (figure 2.4). These late Pleistocene erosional channels span much of the Ontario Lake Plain and were likely formed during deglaciation either by sub- glacial drainage or by meltwaters flowing eastward along the retreating ice front toward the Mohawk Valley. DEM imagery from central New York shows that these west-to- east trending channels run perpendicular to (and in some cases have truncated) north-south oriented Late Wisconsin drumlins on the Ontario Lake Plain. By the time of human entry into the New York region circa 13,000 cal BP, melt- water had long since abandoned these channels. With each channel measuring up to 0.5 km wide and incised 5-10 m into the late Pleistocene landscape, these features could have facilitated human colonization and later seasonal trav- els of Paleoindians across the Ontario Plain. Paleoindians also could have entered eastern New York via a southern corridor, following the Susquehanna or Del- aware valleys upstream (Newby and Bradley 2007; Ritchie 1957) (see figure 2.2B, 4). By crossing divides, these drain- ages lead into the Mohawk and Wallkill/Hudson valleys, respectively. These northern and southern entry routes highlight the strategic importance of the Hudson Valley during the late Pleistocene, as a corridor for accessing toolstone and subsistence resources and also as a jumping-off point for initial entry, and later seasonal travels, into the rest of the Far Northeast. Sequence of Colonization Recent AMS radiocarbon dates on early Paleoindian oc- cupations in northern Ohio and the upper Delaware Val- ley indicate that fluted point populations were present in regions proximal to western and southeastern New York by circa 12,900 cal BP (Gingerich 2007, 2011; Gingerich and Waters 2007; Waters et al. 2009). Gonsistent with the ap- pearance of early fluted point sites and isolates across parts of the Far Northeast, we assume that this approximates the entry date for human groups into the New York region. Paleoindian site locations in Bradley et al. (2008), cali- brated with their proposed point sequence, offer a provi- sional window on the earliest incursions of Native American groups into the eastern New York, as well as later settlement trends. These data, combined with a subsequent review of Paleoindian site distributions across the Far Northeast (Lothrop et al. 2011), suggest changes through time in the Paleoindian occupation of eastern New York. Early Paleoindian. Based on site distributions, eastern New York may have been most heavily occupied during Early Paleoindian times.

Locations of selected Paleoindian sites in eastern New York and vicinity. Swale, and West Athens Hill, record perhaps the earliest oc- cupations in the lower-middle Hudson Valley (figure 2.5). Northeast of the Hudson Valley, Kings Road/Whipple point sites are also present in the middle and upper Con- necticut valley (DEDIC, Whipple, Jefferson III) (Bradley et al. 20o8:Figure 2.7). Vail/Debert point sites — believed to postdate Kings Road/Whipple point occupations — appear to be absent in eastern New York. Occupying more north- erly settings, these sites appear in northwestern Maine and farther east at the Debert and Belmont site cluster in Nova Scotia (Bradley et al. 20o8:Figure ii; Rosenmeier et al., this volume). Bull Brook/ West Athens Hill point sites are more broadly distributed across central and southern portions of the Far Northeast and in eastern New York, include West Athens Hill, the Davis site, and perhaps the Sundler site (Bradley et al. 20o8:Figure 13). Bull Brook/ West Athens Hill point sites at Wapanucket, Bull Brook, and Spiller Farm record near-Atlantic coastal occupations for the first time (dated at Bull Brook to ca. 12,400 cal BP; Robinson et al. 2009), and the Windy City site at the Munsungun chert source area indicates more northerly occupations also. After first entering a new region such as the Hudson Valley, how long would it take immigrant Paleoindians to identify optimal travel routes and critical resource areas such as toolstone outcrops and productive lands for sea- sonal animal and plant resources? Petersen (2004:xxvi- xxvii) suggests that in the glaciated Northeast this process was probably fairly brief: “Pioneering must have come to an end in most areas relatively quickly, perhaps only a few generations or less than too years.” Considering the site- based evidence above for the earliest Paleoindian occupa- tions of eastern New York, circa 12,900-12,400 cal BP, we can indeed envision “landscape learning” of the Hudson and Champlain lowlands taking place within a few genera- tions after initial entry.

PLENGE PORT MOBIL Paleoindian Occupations in the Hudson Valley 19 less common in eastern New York. To date, examples are limited to the Michaud/Neponset point sites of Dutchess Quarry Caves i and 8 in the Wallkill Valley (Funk and Steadman 1994) and possibly the Sundler site. Funk and Walsh (1988) recorded a possible Crowfield-related point occupation at the Putnam site in the upper Fludson Valley (see figure 2.5). Farther east, Michaud/Neponset point sites occupy the eastern Champlain Basin, the middle-upper Connecticut Valley, southern Maine, and southern Que- bec. In some cases, these Middle Paleoindian sites are dis- tinguished by repeated occupation of discrete landscapes. Terminal fluted point sites with Cormier/Nicholas bifaces display a more restricted distribution focused in southern Maine, northern New Flampshire, and northwestern Ver- mont (Lothrop et al. 2011). Late Paleoindian. Sites producing nonfluted, lanceolate Late Paleoindian points are also rare in eastern New York, represented only by the Lower Saranac site in Clinton County (Flartgen 1991). Ste. Anne/ Varney points at this lo- cality attest to Late Paleoindian occupation of a high terrace formed from deltaic sediments originally deposited by the ancestral Saranac River into the regressing Champlain Sea. Elsewhere in the Far Northeast, Late Paleoindian sites with Agate Basin-related and Ste. Anne/Varney points appear to concentrate in northern New England and southern Que- bec (Bradley et al. 20o8:Figures 23, 26) . This northern focus for Late Paleoindian sites mirrors similar distributions in the eastern Great Lakes (Ellis 2004b; Ellis and Deller 1990; Jackson 2004). Taken together, these site location data suggest that Paleoindian occupations in eastern New York were heavi- est during Early Paleoindian colonization and settling in across the region. During both Middle Paleoindian and Late Paleoindian times, occupation of the region may have been less intensive, perhaps reflecting Paleoindian settle- ment focused farther east. FLUTED POINTS AND SITES: IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEOINDIAN SETTLEMENT Flere we review available data from eastern New York re- lated to Paleoindian settlement adaptations. We begin with an overview of published sites for the region and their im- plications for site typologies from a functional standpoint.
