Two old men on a bench reflect on religion, politics, life and happy slapping, but it transpires there is more to their relationship than we realise. Hilarious sit-down drama about age, showbiz and the cartography of friendship.\n\n'There are fringe legends and then there is Arthur Smith' (Bruce Dessau).\n\n'... all-time favourite double act Fiasco Job Job' (Harry Hill, Fight!).\n\n“100 Things I Meant To Tell You”\n\nArthur’s latest book.
