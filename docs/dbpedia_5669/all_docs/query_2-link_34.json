First coming across as a cheeky chappie, it doesn’t take long to realise that Wilson has a lot more strings to his bow.\n\nA mixture of sharp observations, pinpoint accents and curveball one liners that suit all types of audiences.\n\nTestimonials:\n\n“Smart, charismatic and a huge hit with audiences at up the creek. Wilson is fast becoming a great name to watch out for” – Up the Creek Comedy Club\n\n“Awesome, a real undiscovered gem in this new comedy landscape” – Tom Stade\n\nArthur Smith\n\n…is a bit of a star…\n\nComedian, Presenter, Actor, Writer (and Night Mayor of Balham – self appointed), Arthur is one of the much admired originals of the great British alternative comedy scene. Arthur has a consistently brilliant talent and ability to provide light entertainment whilst also still finding new and interesting ways to make people laugh. It is no surprise, therefore, that he remains a sought after artist by Comedy Clubs, Theatres, Festivals and Private Events and is regularly seen and heard on Television and Radio.\n\nCredits:\n\nTV:\n\nGrumpy Old Men (BBC)\n\nQI (BBC)\n\nHave I Got News For You (BBC)\n\nThey Think Its All Over (BBC)\n\nNever Mind The Buzzcocks (BBC)\n\nPeople Just Do Nothing (BBC)\n\nRed Dwarf (BBC)\n\nFilthy Rich & Catflap (BBC)\n\nGirls On Top (ITV)\n\nPyjamarama (ITV)\n\nArthur and Phil Go Off (Channel 4)\n\nRoom 101 (BBC)\n\nThe One Show (BBC)\n\nAre You Being Served (BBC – 2016)\n\nCelebrity University Challenge (BBC)\n\nPointless Celebrities (BBC)\n\nCelebrity The Chase (ITV)\n\nMastermind (BBC)\n\nNewsnight (BBC)\n\nClive Anderson Talks Back (Channel 4)\n\nCountdown (Channel 4)\n\nJust A Minute (BBC)\n\nWhose Line Is It Anyway (Channel 4)\n\nMarried (BBC)\n\nNightcap (BBC)\n\nIdent (Short – Aardman Animations – Voice)\n\nRex The Runt (Animation – Voice)\n\nThe Animal Train (Animation – Voice)\n\nRomuald The Reindeer (Animation – Voice)\n\nLife of Grime (BBC – Voice)\n\nMoney For Nothing (BBC – Voice)\n\nRadio:\n\nLoose Ends (BBC Radio 4)\n\nThe Comedy Club Interviews (BBC Radio 4 Extra)\n\nArthur Smith’s Balham Bash (BBC Radio 4)\n\nArthur Smith’s Last Hangover (BBC Radio 4 Extra)\n\nSmith Lectures (BBC Radio 2)\n\nExcess Baggage (BBC Radio 4)\n\nArthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen (BBC Radio 4 Extra)\n\nArthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen, Again (BBC Radio 4 Extra)\n\nSaturday Live (BBC Radio 4)\n\nMidweek (BBC Radio 4)\n\nWriting:\n\n100 Things I Meant To Tell You (book – publish date autumn 2019) · – My Name is Daphne Fairfax (autobiography)\n\nAn Evening with Gary Lineker (with Chris England – Olivier nominated stage play & TV Movie)\n\nLive Bed Show (Stage)\n\nMy Summer With Des (TV Movie)\n\nSit-Down Comedy (contributor – published 2003)\n\nHello Mum (TV)\n\nArthur and Phil Go Off (TV)\n\nJosie (TV)\n\nIdent (Short – Aardman Animations (additional material)\n\nHallmark Cards\n\nSolo Shows:\n\nSYD\n\nArthur Smith’s Swan Lake\n\nArthur Smith: That Which Is Not Said\n\nArthur Smith: ARTURART\n\nArthur Smith’s Public Lecture: ‘The Toilet Role of Arturart in the History of Western Representation\n\nArthur Smith: Edinburgh Book Festival\n\nAaaaaaaargh!
