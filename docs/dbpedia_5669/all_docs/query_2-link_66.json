It was aiming for a 2007 release date, and was set in the Cold War during the 1970s. It kept getting delayed and was never actually released, only getting an announcement at E3 2009. There was some leaked concept art and screenshots, but no actual builds have appeared.\n\n…And Justice For Gore: A Gore and Noise Tribute to Metallica: This was a gore grind and noise core tribute album dedicated to Metallica.

They recorded their first album, Sacks of People, in 2001, to little success. Some of the music stores would even give away the album for free. However, in 2002, the album would gain traction because of the guitarist, Luke Helder, being the Midwest Pipe Bomber. The album would even be auctioned off eBay for $200. The tracks would be lost for many years. This changed in 2021 when two tracks, “Conformity” and “Black and Back”, would be found. The rest of the tracks would be found in September 2023.\n\nIncel Project: This was an online documentary series that ran from 2008 to 2012.

The show has a lot of cut content that hasn’t been released online.\n\nSuper Mario 64 Secret Star: This was a YouTube video first uploaded in August of 2007. At first, it seems like it’s about how you can find a secret star in Mario 64, with the video being recorded on a flip phone to feel more realistic. Then, the video turns out to be a screamer prank, cutting to the zombie from the K-Fee Ghost Car commercial. Also, the video was apparently muted for copyright concerns, though it’s unclear what the song in it was. Some say it was either “Dreamscape” by 009 Sound System, “Database” by Alexander Perls, or “Bring Me to Life” by Evanescence. The original video is lost, with only a low quality reaction video of it surviving.\n\nTelechat English Dub: Telechat was a French-Belgian puppet show that acted as a parody of news programs for children.

No one could record the footage due to there being a no recording policy. From what was described though, it seems almost exactly the same as the final game:\n\nGogola: This is a 1966 Bollywood movie that takes inspiration from 1954’s Godzilla. It’s a similar plot to the original, but with the Godzilla-like monster, Gogola, being in Mumbai instead of Tokyo. The government then puts a bounty on the monster, which catches the attention of a scientist and his daughter. When it released, it likely wasn’t a hit, considering how it’s Indra Dhanush Films’, the studio behind this, only film. Aside from the soundtrack and some pictures, the film is lost.\n\nBaby Shaker: This was a very controversial app when it released. It was a “game” where you had a baby on your phone. You then had to shake your phone as fast and violently as you can. The app wasn’t free either, you had to pay 99 cents for this shit. It was so controversial that it was eventually banned from the App Store. The app itself is lost, but footage of it is available.\n\nMetallica: The Game: Another Metallica themed entry. This was a planned 2005 open world game that was meant to release on the PS2, Xbox, and PC. It was said to be a driving/shooting type game that heavily featured Metallica’s music.

Despite all of this, the episode is still lost.\n\nThe Moxy Show: This was a CGI show made by Cartoon Network in the 90s. Basically, before Cartoon Network had original programming, they would mostly air old Looney Tunes and Hanna Barbera shows. In between those shows, between 1993 and 1995, they would have these shorts involving an orange CGI dog named Moxy, voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait, and his pet Flea. Some of the episodes are still lost.\n\nWeaponless Self-Defense: This was an early BBC show that aired from 1936 to 1937.

It would end up releasing in 2021, after the deaths of both vocalist Pete Burns and drummer Steve Coy.\n\nNirvana Sings Nirvana: So, when most people think of Nirvana, they think of the late 80s/early 90s grunge band. However, there was actually an older band called Nirvana from the UK. They had planned on doing a cover album where they performed Nirvana’s grunge songs. The album was scrapped after the passing of Kurt Cobain. Only one song, their cover of “Lithium”, has appeared online.\n\nLord Byron’s Memoirs: Near the end of his life, the English poet Lord Byron wrote memoirs about his life. He would sell it to Irish writer Thomas Moore, who then sold it to Scottish publisher John Murray, hoping that it would one day be published.

They decided to burn the only copy of his memoir, causing what is now known as the greatest literary crime in history.\n\nKraina Grzybow TV - Poradnik Usmiechu (3): So, this is said to be an episode of a Polish surreal psychological horror online show called Poradnik Usmiechu, which translates to Smile Guide.

The magazine would have two separate runs, one from 1969 to 1981, and another from 2000 to 2018. The website had things you’d find in the magazine, like toys, games, videos, cartoons, jokes, stories, and activities. The website first launched in 2000 but closed in 2015, with much of the content going down with it. Some has resurfaced, like the cartoons posted on the site.\n\nHeil Honey! I’m Home!: Oh dear. So you ever just look at something and wonder how it even got past the drawing board? This was a British sitcom that aired in 1990. It was a parody of 1950s sitcoms, but the lead characters are, get ready for this….Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. The consensus for this show was so bad that it was cancelled after episode one. It’s now seen as one of the worst shows ever made. An entire first season of this show was made, but never aired. Hopefully, it stays that way.\n\nMy Little Pony - Rainbow Factory: There was a planned fan animation based on the My Little Pony creepypasta Rainbow Factory.

On a Saturday evening in the UK in November 1977, a news cast was interrupted by a spaceman named Vrillion, who was a part of the Ashtar Galactic Command.

The film never ended up being released for some reason.\n\nPlayStation All Stars Battle Royale DLC: PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale was basically PlayStation’s attempt at making a Smash Bros game.

It never released and we only have some footage.\n\nAstro Boy Test Pitch Animation: This is the test footage for the 2009 Astro Boy film. While the whole test pitch is unavailable, there are parts of it that can be found.\n\nBalinese Slapping Fish: This is a short series that aired on Nickelodeon Australia in 1998. It’s about two fish that would slap each other. It was lost, but now, all of the episodes are available.\n\nCook’s Night Out: This show aired on the BBC in 1937. It was a cooking show that featured the French chef, Marcel Boulestin. It was said that there were only five episodes made. Since it aired live, none of the episodes were ever archived, as usual with old BBC programming.\n\nStar and the Forces of Evil: This was the unaired pilot for the Disney Channel show, Star Vs. the Forces of Evil. It was originally pitched to Nickelodeon, but they passed on it, with Disney picking it up instead. It’s basically the same thing as the actual first episode, “Star Comes to Earth”, but with different character designs. It would be lost, but finally found in 2023.\n\nWhatever Happened To…Robot Jones?: This is a Cartoon Network show that ran for two seasons from 2002 to 2003. It’s about a teenage robot that goes to a suburban school. He experiences normal things that any teenager would experience. Some of the episodes of this show are missing. This includes episodes in season 2 which originally would’ve featured Robot Jones being voiced by a text-to-speech modulator, like in season 1, but ended up being replaced by an actual VA. There were also some episodes planned but were scrapped after the show was cancelled.\n\nBalloon Trip NDS Tech Demo: This was a tech demo done for the Nintendo DS. It was said to have combined elements of Yoshi’s Island and Balloon Fight. It never really released, so all we have of it now are some videos. It was, however, reworked into the game Yoshi’s Touch and Go.\n\nCarving For NDS Tech Demo: Here’s another Nintendo DS Tech Demo. This one allowed you to carve different sculptures. Again, it never released outside of E3 2004, with only some footage being available.\n\nSocks the Cat Rocks the Hill For Sega Genesis: Here’s a pretty interesting game. This one would’ve let you play as Socks the Cat, AKA Bill Clinton’s cat, stopping rat spies from stealing nuclear plans. The bosses would’ve been based on political figures, like Ross Perot and Jimmy Carter. It had a planned 1993 release for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, but never released due to its publisher shutting down. While the build for the SNES version was found in 2018, the Sega Genesis build is still lost."
