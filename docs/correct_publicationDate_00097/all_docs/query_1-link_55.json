The culmination of a progressive movement that, for the first time, focused on producing texts specifically oriented to appeal to children, this era continues to be cited as a major source of inspiration for modern juvenile authors and illustrators. During this period, the sheer number of published children's texts increased exponentially, with publishing houses releasing thousands of new books annually. While most were substandard in quality, earning the label \"toy books,\" the highest echelon featured a roster of acclaimed artists that produced painstaking illustrations which continue to be reproduced in new editions even today. Many of the top artists of this era either earned lasting fame as a result of their work in children's publishing, such as Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, or solidified already well-established reputations by crossing over to juvenile-themed illustrations, such as George Cruikshank and John Tenniel.\n\nAs a movement, the \"Golden Age\" can be difficult to define given the dramatically varied artistic visions, subject matter, and broadly attributed period of time over which it is said to have occurred. However, several generalizations regarding the underlying themes and motifs of the Golden Age can be made. In theory, artists ascribed to this period are remembered for their interest in providing a more intuitive connection between the text and image than had been present in children's literature prior to the Victorian Age. As a result, they introduced the first aspects of realism into popular children's illustrations with the intent of creating a gateway to the text rather than drawing attention away from the text. Additionally, while the subject matter for Golden Age artists primarily revisited previously published material—most commonly, revised editions of famous novels, educational primers and alphabet books, or classic folk stories, including the works of George MacDonald or the Brothers Grimm—Golden Age illustrators distinguished themselves through their use of modern art theories to reinterpret these more classical texts. As a result, facets of several different artistic styles were used to reinvigorate conventional children's publications, evincing the influences of the Pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic Art movement, Art Noveau, and Les Nabis, among others. But perhaps most importantly, the Golden Age oversaw a new devotion by artists and publishers to children's literature that was focused solely on young audiences, fostered largely by improvements in printing methods—a result of the dawning Industrial Age—which allowed better quality illustrations to accompany these works.\n\nAs a result of the Golden Age's broad scope and time period, critics tend to divide the movement into three phases defined by three leading schools of illustrators—the early Victorians, a group of innovative masters who helped enable the ascendancy of color illustrations; the Victorians, whose work is generally ascribed as being the artistic peak of the movement; and the Brandywine School, a group of American illustrators formed under the tutelage of Howard Pyle who reinterpreted traditional Victorian motifs to create an uniquely American artistic style. There are two primary figures who are commonly associated with the Golden Age's early Victorian period: George Cruikshank and John Tenniel. Both men achieved early fame as political caricaturists for such magazines as The Scourge and Punch. While working almost exclusively in black-and-white plates drawn in ink, they laid a structural and stylistic framework that edged away from earlier children's illustrations which simply served a decorative purpose. Indeed, some critics even label Cruikshank's illustrations of Jacob and Wilheim Grimm's first English translation of German Popular Stories (1823) as the first manifestation of the Golden Age. Cruikshank was also renowned for his early collaborations with Charles Dickens, providing the illustrations for the first edition of Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress (1838). John Tenniel found similar acclaim with his groundbreaking plate illustrations for the first edi-tions of Lewis Carroll's children's classics Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871).\n\nThe second epoch of the Golden Age—the mid- to late-Victorian period—witnessed, what some consider, the zenith of children's illustration, a result of the culmination of a cultural shift in both societal thought and color image reproduction capabilities. Printer Edmund Evans published many of the most acclaimed children's texts from this era, including the works of three of the most prominent Golden Age illustrators: Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway. Crane was an admirer of the Aesthetic Art movement, which sought to incorporate contemporary art into the mass-produced publications of industrial England. Crane believed that a balance could be achieved between the seemingly disparate forms of mass entertainment and great art; the success of his efforts is highlighted by some of his best known works such as The Frog Prince (1874) and The Baby's Opera, A Book of Old Rhymes with New Dresses (1877). As Crane's contemporary, Randolph Caldecott suggested an appreciation for adventure and experimentation as well as a strong belief in the use of clean bold lines that nonetheless expressed a nostalgic undercurrent for a simpler era, the details of which are readily apparent in what is perhaps his most famous work: The Three Jovial Huntsmen (1880). In books such as Under the Window, with Coloured Pictures and Rhymes for Children (1879) and A Apple Pie: An Old-Fashioned Alphabet Book (1886), Kate Greenaway also invoked a sentimental revisiting of the pre-Victorian era, presenting a bevy of young children playfully enjoying sunny scenes of everyday events, all facets of her characteristic images of an idealized childhood. But where Caldecott's broad strokes attempted to incorporate the stylistically impressionist forms of such artists as James Whistler, Greenaway's illustrations were slavishly detail-oriented recreations of eighteenth-century pastoral scenes. Despite their fundamentally disparate approaches to engaging their young audiences, as clients of the same publishing house, Crane, Caldecott, and Greenaway were friendly rivals, and their work remains as examples of some of the most resplendent illustrations to ever accompany a children's text.\n\nThe third phase of the Golden Age revolves around Howard Pyle's American Brandywine School. Drawing upon the legacy of Crane, Caldecott, and Greenaway, Pyle blended Victorian realism with romanticism, a style that brought a new artistic vigor to the author/illustrator's own juvenile adventure books such as The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (1883) and The Story of King Arthur and His Knights (1903). While the Victorian Golden Age artists would frame their illustrations with no trace of action or consequence, Pyle's artwork was fraught with the tension and drama of the text he was illustrating. In this sense, Pyle was faithful to the doctrines of the Victorian belief that illustration should be more than decorative, working to advance the plot as much as the words on the page. But as important as his artistic contributions were, Pyle's greatest personal legacy might be his instruction of a group of illustrators that is collectively called the Brandywine School. Composed of such luminaries of American illustration as N. C. Wyeth, Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Maxfield Parrish, Frank Schoonover, Harvey Dunn, and Violet Oakley, the Brandywine artists were all pupils of Pyle and evince varying aspects of his tutelage in their work. Of all the Brandywine students, N. C. Wyeth's artistic style most parallels the works of his teacher. His efforts in children's literature were largely within the realm of adventure novels—including Treasure Island (1911) and Robinson Crusoe (1920)—texts that featured explosions of bright color and raging action. Like Pyle, Wyeth's work served to underscore the action, linking thought to the visual stimulation offered by the illustration. However, while Wyeth was the scion to Pyle's illustrative style, other Brandywine artists—particularly his female students—demonstrated a willingness to explore other aspects of illustration. For example, in some ways, the works of Jessie Willcox Smith seem more reminiscent of Kate Greenaway than the works of Howard Pyle. Like Greenaway, Smith dabbled with the idealized mold of drawing gently romanticized portraits of happy children sedately content in their own warm homes. But, unlike Greenaway's sentimental universe, Smith's works showed the complete family, not just the fantasy realm of the child.\n\nBy the late twenties, the era of the Golden Age began to slowly fade, with only a few illustrators such as Beatrix Potter and Arthur Rackham taking up the mantle of the Victorian and Brandywine traditions. And even though these artists can lay claim as being the equals of any of their forebears, they are sometimes considered an afterthought due to their late prestige. Indeed, Arthur Rackham's illustrations for Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows (1940) is generally regarded as the final great issue of the Golden Age. Still, the influence of these early masters remains widely felt in almost every picture book published today in terms of format and intent. Further, the Golden Age illustrators are credited for help-ing save hundreds of traditional folk tales from obscurity through their faithful retellings, even as the Industrial Age threatened their existence as society continued its dramatic shift away from the countryside and into more urban settings. But more importantly, the Golden Age illustrators saw the value that art could play in children's literature, appreciating that good art could teach and motivate. Despite the gains made to children's literature over the years, the Golden Age remains remarkable for its contrast of vivid beauty and realism while maintaining its roots in traditional illustration. In honor of their contributions to the genre, many of the most prestigious awards in children's literature bear the names of the Golden Age masters, including the Caldecott Medal for best American children's book and the Kate Greenaway Medal given annually to the best British children's illustrator.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE WORKS\n\nRandolph Caldecott\n\nThe Diverting History of John Gilpin [illustrator; written by William Cowper] (picture book) 1878\n\nThe House that Jack Built (picture book) 1878\n\nSing a Song for Sixpence (picture book) 1880\n\nThe Three Jovial Huntsmen (picture book) 1880\n\nThe Queen of Hearts (picture book) 1881\n\nHey Diddle Diddle, and Baby Bunting (picture book) 1882; also published as Hey Diddle Diddle and Other Funny Poems\n\nA Frog He Would a-Wooing Go (picture book) 1883\n\nSome of Aesop's Fables with Modern Instances [illustrator; edited and compiled by Alfred Caldecott] (picture book) 1883; also published as The Caldecott Aesop: Twenty Fables, 1978; and as Aesop's Fables, 1990\n\nJackanapes [illustrator; written by Juliana H.

Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2001.\n\n[In the following essay, Lundin provides a comprehensive analysis of the \"cultural discourse\" surrounding the works of several major illustrators from the \"Golden Age of Children's Literature,\" including Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway. Lundin presents ten traditional aspects of review that she uses as criteria to evaluate the impact of the Golden Age illustrators on their intended audiences.]\n\nThe twentieth-century picture book bears the mark of Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway. They are our historical horizon, the cultural landscape against which our modern books are foregrounded, silhouetted. Indeed, children's books, particularly from the late Victorian period, look familiar to us today. Instead of the plain fare of instruction, books for the young appealed to adult as well as child fancies. Picture books were celebrated as works of art and enjoyed a large following. From the largesse of the literati, with its tradition of au-thoring and editing children's books, to the speculative market of sensational fiction, children's books shared a public literary culture of young and old. The popularity of children's literature can be determined not only by the diversity of books produced but also by the nature of the productions and the manner in which they were presented. In essence, by looking at what the critics said.\n\nThe Victorian periodical press both reflected and constructed the response of the public to a literature of childhood. Literary journalists reviewed children's books in response to a heightened interest in children's reading and to a concomitant rise in the juvenile book market. Journals and magazines included essays on children's literature in its relationship to education, book arts, and the marketplace. These reviews and commentary constituted the criteria by which children's books were interpreted and given value in the late Victorian period.\n\nHow were children's books received in the formative period of the late nineteenth century? What contributions did the critics make in shaping the cultural discourse over children's books? How does this reception compare to the climate that shapes contemporary book publishing? To answer these questions, we turn to the cultural gatekeepers of the age—the periodical reviewers, the cultural mediators—to see how they perceived and promoted children's books. I embarked on what was an immersion in the cultural discourse of the late Victorian age, as revealed by their voices across a century. To understand these critical years of the Golden Age of Children's Literature, seventy-five British and American periodicals were chosen from a twenty-five-year period. The primary question was to what extent late Victorian criticism reflected and constructed a certain climate that encouraged the growth and development of what has become modern children's literature. Readings in reception theory afforded a foundation for a study of historical readership.\n\nReception Theory\n\nReception theory is a modern approach to literary history that examines the ways in which literary works are received by readers. The examination of \"reception\" began in the 1950s in the fields of jurisprudence, theology, and philosophy. The application of \"reception\" to literary studies developed in the late 1960s as a way to relate the three elements of aesthetic communication—author, work, and recipient (reader, critic, or audience). The approach is a reaction to the limitations of intrinsic literary study, often known as \"New Criticism,\" in which a literary work is considered complete unto itself, autonomous and apart from the reader. Reception theory was launched by the theories of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hans Robert Jauss, Wolfgang Iser, and furthered by the work of Stanley Fish, Jane Tompkins, Jonathan Culler, among others, who argue for the role that audiences play in the scheme of things. Reception theory is central to the larger field of Cultural Studies, which shares interest in the social history of how culture is produced and received.\n\nReception theory is related to other rhetorical studies, such as reader-response criticism. What they have in common is an interest in the relationship between the literary text and its reader, between what is being communicated and how it is received. Each reader-oriented approach acknowledges that literary works do not exist within a vacuum—a departure from formalist criticism—but have meaning from their interaction with readers. Reception study is distinguished by its greater concern with historical changes affecting the reading public than with the solitary reader. Literary meaning is determined over time, by a series of readings constituting its history of influence. The history of reception includes those literary and sociological factors that shape individual responses in a given time and place. The context of reception is defined in material and ideological terms, in aesthetic terms, or in terms of evaluative interpretive communities that mediate between the literary product and audience.\n\nReaders of a certain social group—what Stanley Fish calls \"interpretive communities\"—shape readings and evaluations of a literary work. Historically situated, the community of interpreters are a work's first readers. Wolfgang Iser suggests that audiences play an important part in what he calls the \"realization\" of a text.1 Jane Tompkins views historical reception as the only way to re-create the original context from which the books emerged and responded to the cultural discourse of their time.2 The history of reception includes those literary and sociological factors that shape individual responses in a given time and place, often called \"the horizons of expectation\" that frames the impact and interpretation of a work. To Gadamer, the concept of a horizon is \"the range of vision that includes everything that can be seen from a particular vantage point,\" which includes the shared meanings or \"prejudices\" of an age.3 A work's first readers are privileged for their proximity to the text's cultural formation and their critical role as the audience of ideal readers—and consumers—for whom a work is conceived. In Jauss's words, the horizon \"conditioned the genesis and effect of the work.\"4 Examining the contemporary reception of a literary work at the moment of its emergence offers insight into why and for whom a work is conceived—an impact that may be lost to a modern reader.\n\nHistoricizing the context to a book's reception provides the opportunity to see texts in a different light. Instead of embodying universal themes of transcendent value, literature bears the cultural realities of its age, the national, social, economic, and institutional interests and concerns of an historical context from which texts arise and continue to speak. This way of looking at literature challenges canonical notions and allows for a broader consideration of \"literary\" and \"extraliterary\" texts. Children's books and picture books matter and make sense as agency, what Tompkins calls \"sensational designs\" that seek to move readers and make things happen as \"attempts to redefine the social order.\"5 A text's \"cultural work\" arises from its influence in the culture as a discourse of power. A literary text's particular historical audience responds to the work in a dialectical relationship by the way it answers the fundamental questions of its age. The questions and answers embedded in a literary work in a particular historical moment can only be understood by a later age through reconstructing the horizons of expectations of that time, which reveal how the readers of that day viewed and understood the work.\n\nAllowing historical contingencies to be part of our perception of literature also offers a glimpse into the politics of reputation. Tompkins considers how works deemed classic are embedded in a network of circumstances, which are political, \"since they involve preferences, interests, tastes, and beliefs that are not universal but part of a particular reader's situation.\"6 Some of these circumstances are artfully crafted, and others are serendipitous interventions by figures of status and influence. Readers are always situated in relation to a work in a particular framework of beliefs and social practices. This insight does not deny a text's aesthetic value but explains, in part, why some texts reach a wide audience and rich reward, while others remain obscure. Whatever a text's intrinsic merit, a literary work succeeds or fails in terms of its cultural production, which includes publishing practices, pedagogical and critical traditions, economic structures, social networks, and national needs. Classics are made, not born.\n\nA key to the interpretation of cultural production lies in the historical studies of reader response criticism. The salient features that shaped literary fashions and critical reputations in the late nineteenth century were embedded in the horizons of expectations of the age—the assumptions of the readership as to childhood and its literature. The horizons of expectations with respect to children's literature in the 1880s and 1890s constituted the framework in which juvenile books were received. These standards are implicit in the Victorian periodicals of the day, in which reviewers and commentators of literary magazines and journals, as well as the popular press, articulated their expectations for literature and art. The careers of Crane, Caldecott, and Greenaway must be seen within the context of children's literature with its cultural assumptions and presuppositions, and within the context of periodical publication, in which critics embraced children's books as a valid subject and authorized their existence as text and image. Drawing on reception theory and on my own readings into the cultural discourse on children's books in late nineteenth-century England and America, I construct my sense of the spectrum of these contextual perspectives. I turn to the documentary evidence of the reviews and commentary of contemporary readers, drawing on approximately seventy-five periodicals as representative of the leading review journals of the day, as determined through Poole's Index, Nineteenth-Century Readers' Guide, and Wellesley Index.\n\nMy research reveals which periodicals, in part, reviewed children's books, something we have not known in children's book history. Of this number, forty-six periodicals, or 61%, did some reviewing of juvenile literature. On the inclusion of commentary on children's literature, fifty periodicals, or 67%, were represented. Some periodicals that did not review children's books included articles about issues related to children's reading, noted children's book authors, or classic children's books of an earlier era. The high percentage of periodicals covering children's books is significant, considering that most were literary reviews or magazines oriented to a general adult readership. As this late Victorian period was prior to the establishment of professional journals in the field, these periodicals represent the nature and extent of cultural discourse concerning children and their literature.\n\nBased on my reading of the contemporary cultural discourse of the period (1875–1900), and in the process of determining the context for the reception of Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway, I constructed the following horizons, realizing that Crane, Caldecott, and Greenaway's contemporary reception could be examined only by understanding the larger cultural context of the day: the historical situation of which both the readers and the works were a part.\n\nVictorian Horizons of Expectations\n\nThe horizons of expectations with respect to children's literature in the last quarter of the nineteenth century constituted the context in which, I believe, juvenile books were received. The literary discourse of the period can be described as including the following spectrum of positions:\n\n(1) Treatment of children's books as a commodity\n\n(2) Elevation of children's books as works of art\n\n(3) Emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature\n\n(4) Lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature\n\n(5) A growing gender division\n\n(6) Diversification of the didactic tradition\n\n(7) Continuing debate on fantasy and realism\n\n(8) Romantic idealization of childhood and its literature\n\n(9) Attention to the historiography of children's literature\n\n(10) Anxiety about the changing character of children's literature\n\nThese characteristics of the literary climate describe the complex and often conflicting critical reception of children's books in the late Victorian period. While these issues have been present to some extent since the advent of children's book publishing in the mid-eighteenth century, they converged to create a unique climate for the reception of children's books in England and America in the late nineteenth century.\n\nTreatment of Children's Books as a Commodity\n\nVictorian children's books were perceived as commodities, in the sense of prizes or rewards, gift books, and toy books. Books as prizes had a long tradition in juvenile publishing. They were originally designed to impart moral guidelines, to reinforce exemplary behavior, and to caution against the evils of intemperance or profanity. The Religious Tract Society, with evangelical leanings, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, with a broader base, were two pioneer publishers in the field whose influence continued throughout the century. By the 1870s prize books were more secular in content and more attractive in appearance. Many of the mainstream publishers, such as Cassell, Routledge, Ward Lock, Nelson, and Nisbet, developed reward series. Reviewers rarely discussed prize books as such, but covered the leading publishers; the Times regularly reviewed new works of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, noting that they excelled in storybooks with a wide range of tone and subject matter.7 The visibility of prize books in the marketplace was most evident in periodical advertisements: the Religious Tract Society announced its list in the Spectator (1879) as \"Christmas Presents and School Prizes\"; Mudie's headlined an extensive list as \"Christmas Presents and Prizes.\"8\n\nHowever, while this \"prize book\" market was more institutional, geared to Sunday Schools and other educational purposes, most of the children's book trade was centered on the home. The multitude of periodicals, the promotion of books as designed for family reading, and the timeliness and publishing zeal in late autumn months for the holiday gift market all pointed to the significance of the family as a responsive market for children's book publishing. For instance, the appearance of children's books at the Christmas season promoted the association of juvenile books as illustrated holiday books or annuals. Illustrated gift books, often called \"Keepsakes,\" \"Forget-Me-Nots,\" or \"Friendship's Offering,\" were produced from the beginning of the nineteenth century. They were essentially booklets of verse, by whatever famous personage could be cited as a contributor, and illustrated with steel engravings. Seasonal themes were common. The gift books were meant to be ornamental, in the style of our \"coffee table books\" today, something more to adorn a room rather than to be read.\n\nThe annuals began to be fashioned into illustrated Christmas stories by popular authors. It was in this tradition that the public received Dickens's A Christmas Carol (1843) and Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring (1855). This fashion died out, too, but after this the illustrated magazines revived the \"Annual\" tradition in their special Christmas numbers. In the late 1860s holiday gift books, illustrating a favorite poem or other literary masterpiece, began to appear on the shelves at Christmastime. Publishers vied with each other as the demand for the books grew. While only a few publishers were associated with the Christmas book trade at mid-century, by 1880, as the Dial noticed, the leading publishers, both English and American, were competing and employing \"much of the finest literary, artistic, and inventive talent that clus-ters around the publishing craft.\"9 Much of this attention was directed to a young audience. The Graphic (1882) noted a marked change in the character of Christmas literature: \"Formerly the season produced a host of handsome and elaborately illustrated 'drawing-room' volumes; now such works are few and far between, and publishers' energies seem concentrated on the childish public.\"10\n\nThe concentration of children's book publishing at the Christmas season promoted the notion of the book as commodity. The Times (1883) began one of its Christmas book surveys by connecting the \"English manner of celebrating Christmas\" and \"the development of popular English art.\" The fashion for exchanging gifts promoted the publishing of books, especially with \"the growing taste for reading\" and \"the publishers of many classes\" eager to provide competition.11\n\nJuvenile books regularly appeared approximately two months before Christmas. Most publishers featured children's books only at this season, a practice that elicited commentary. The Graphic considered \"how little juvenile literature is published at any other time.\"12 The Nation noted in 1879, \"Every holiday season brings a fresh assortment of stories for the young which, as being new, recommend themselves as gifts and do their share in the cultivation of juvenile ethics.\"13 In 1880 the Saturday Review commented that the quantity is much more remarkable than the quality: \"A flock of brilliant cloth covers, a crowd of woodcuts, is the general impression left on the weary eye and brain\"14; in 1882 the journal observed that Christmas books come out earlier all the time, now appearing by late September15; and in 1886 Christmas picture books were \"sufficiently numerous to engage the whole of the fabulous family of the old lady that lived in a shoe.\"16 The Illustrated London News (1882) defined the gift book genre as consisting of handsome editions of popular classics, illustrated with pictorial designs; new flights of fancy, such as narrative poems or fairy tales, also furnished with graphic illustration; and children's books, nursery tales, rhymes, or \"new ones specially composed for the beloved infant race of this present time.\"17 The Graphic stated in 1892 that the juvenile literature of the year was crowded into a few weeks, \"a custom too deeply rooted for change.\"18 This custom, according to the Bookman (1896), impeded literary criticism, since the books appeared as a great bulk, impossible to characterize except in a cursory manner.19\n\nVictorian children's books developed in part from the gift book tradition. John Newbery's pioneer works in the mid-eighteenth century were gift books, containing miscellaneous verse, pictures, and marketing ploys. A Little Pretty Pocket-Book (1744) included toys as rewards and gimmicks of promotion: balls for boys, pincushions for girls. Nineteenth-century children's books perpetuated these associations with the designation of \"toy books.\" Largely a publisher's invention, the term was used to describe contemporary picture books, often issued in series, which depended for their impact on the use of color. The emphasis was indeed on color, not text, which was often slighted, until Edmund Evans transformed the genre with high quality artistic books: the works of Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway.\n\nBy 1895, the Dial, noting the proliferation of Christmas books for children, commented that their imaginative composition could \"supply a modern school of fiction,\" but was instead contained in fifty or so volumes of \"impractical and impossible extravagances.\" To Dial, these books potentially might stimulate the heroism and genius of the future, but, more practically, their sheer volume and excess might just as readily \"crush them.\"20\n\nElevation of Children's Books as Works of Art\n\nChildren's books were transformed during this period from utilitarian fare to objects of art. The Dial (1881) admired the beautiful volumes, resplendent in gilt covers and exquisite illustrations, heaped on the booksellers' shelves, and recalled, in contrast, the books of the writer's own childhood, \"plain and clumsy to ugliness in their exterior.\"21 The Art Journal (1881) noted, too, the startling difference between the toy books of twenty years ago and those of the present: the earlier books were described as \"primitive\" and \"clumsy\" in conception and craftsmanship, characterized by crude lines and harsh colors, devoid of beauty. Acknowledging Randolph Caldecott's influence, the critic, William Henley, stated, \"Art for the nursery has become Art indeed.\"22 The Magazine of Art (1882) chronicled the rise of illustration in children's books, from its infancy in the mid-eighteenth century when the expectations were low; now the standards were high in the use of paper, type, and, especially, color printing, which gave the books the status to be considered as works of art.23\n\nGift books and toy books attained artistic status through technical as well as aesthetic changes. The revival of etching and invention of photomechanical methods of reproduction provided a medium for a new school of illustrators. The success of children's magazines stimulated greater attention to book arts. The competition for subscriptions and quality stories and art work raised the standards in general for children's literature.\n\nThe decade of the 1880s was attuned to art reform. Aestheticism was the name given to the heightened emphasis on art principles in domestic manufacturing, including furniture, ceramics, textiles, wallpapers, and books that began in mid-nineteenth-century England. Its most visible impact was on architecture, where it was known as the \"Queen Anne style.\" This progressive ideal of style led to a greater interest in aesthetics for children. The Aesthetic movement in illustration was heralded by books written for children, with adults in mind, particularly the work of Crane, Caldecott, and Greenaway.\n\nContemporary reviewers were aware of the phenomenon. Grant Allen in the Fortnightly Review (1879) related the work of Robert Louis Stevenson, Walter Crane, and Randolph Caldecott to \"the many products of the Queen Anne revival,\" which he characterized as a reaction to \"the formless solidity of the age wherein we live.\" He astutely observed that literary revivals tended to look back to an idealized world while incorporating touches of the modern spirit as well.24 The Critic (1881) praised the number of excellent toy books on the market, which should help children learn at an early age to distinguish good art from bad.25 The Graphic (1881) surmised that \"children of the nineteenth century ought to grow up with well-cultured artistic tastes if they profit by the daintily illustrated books provided for their delectation.\"26 The Dial (1881) observed that books best show the influence of \"art-culture\" in America. Children's books were touted as a measure of the progress of the American people in applying art to decorative purposes and to the techniques of art. A skillful use of color—\"the last and most sacred element of beauty\"—was considered essential. Holiday books for children revealed the extent of this \"genuine feeling for the beautiful and a correct interpretation of its laws and possible interpretations.\"27 This description, which could function, in itself, as a contemporary definition of Aestheticism, suggests how children's books related to the extension of the movement.\n\nA children's book could hope for no higher praise than the word \"artistic.\" Publishers even advertised their books as such. An advertisement by E. P. Dutton in the Critic (1884) was entitled \"Artistic Children's Books\" and included promotional blurbs that cited one book as a model for students in water-color drawing and another as \"the most charming specimen of really artistic children's books that we have met for a long time.\"28 By the late 1870s, children's books stood at the forefront of fashion, reflecting contemporary artistic motifs and attracting a sizable, sophisticated market.\n\nWhile the Aesthetic movement peaked in the 1860s–1870s, its influence lingered in the status accorded children's books as art. In 1882 the Graphic noted that Aestheticism was beginning to wane, but not in children's books, where it was more influential than ever. The reviewer mentioned the familiar aesthetic themes still so prominent in juvenile books: \"fancies of olden times, soft refined colouring, and humour suggested rather than strongly expressed.\"29 In 1900, the Dial wrote about Walter Crane's picture books, \"the pictures are sufficiently decorative to be used on the nursery walls by lovers of life and beauty.\"30 Aesthetic principles were embodied in the Arts and Crafts movement, with its emphasis on hand craftsmanship and what the English artist William Morris called \"The Book Beautiful.\"\n\nEmphasis on Illustration and Pictorial Effects in Literature\n\nIn the Victorian period art became increasingly important not only in illustrating the text but also in influencing literary discourse. As a visual art, illustration was able to extend the concerns of the journalist and the novelist. In its opening issue in 1842, the Illustrated London News declared that art had become the bride of literature. In the serial novels of Dickens, the illustrations and pictorial narrative worked as one. A public receptive to art was instrumental in the response to illustrated children's books. The use of illustration in both children's and adult literature—picture books, periodicals, and novels—helped to educate the expectations of the public and stimulate a close relationship between books for young and old.\n\nThe popularization of visual elaboration coincided with technical progress in printing for a mass audience. The development of wood engraving was instrumental in creating a popular audience for illustration. Wood engraving was a traditional woodcut technique, dating back to the thirteenth century, in which the parts of a design that are to be white are cut away, while the black parts are left in relief. Thus, both text and illustration can be printed together. Wood engraving had been developing steadily since the mastery of the craft by Thomas Bewick (1753–1828), who perfected the process that was used extensively throughout the nineteenth century, which necessitated hard-wood blocks and tools of metal engraving. He demonstrated the effect of light and shade by lowering parts of the block to print faintly and to create delicate designs by using the close-grained end of boxwood. Bewick's techniques were adapted by news periodicals, which found the unity of the page conducive for mass production.\n\nFrom the 1840s illustrations played a role in periodicals, but by the 1860s visual matter was prominent. Wood engraving was suitable to the large print runs of popular journalism. The development of a workable process of picture reproduction stimulated creativity and the emergence of artists. Professionally trained artists were engaged to illustrate appealing images of Victorian life to accompany serialized fiction, poetry, travel literature, and news stories. Illustration became a staple of popular journalism. The receptivity of the public to these images increased the use of wood engraving to produce publications in greater abundance and economy. The number of new publishers of books and periodicals grew rapidly, as did the reputation of these artists, who enjoyed an unprecedented public following and influence.\n\nFurther technical innovations changed the direction of printing by the mid-1860s. Thomas Bolton developed a technique of transferring a photographed image of a drawing to a wooden block, which enabled the engraver to work on the surface and to preserve the original drawing. George Baxter pioneered a process of using aquatinting to produce a design in color; the technique was further refined by J. M. Kronheim to produce similar effects at a lower cost. Color printing by wood engraving was perfected in the work of Edmund Evans, a printer in direct lineage to Bewick. Evans, apprenticed to Ebenezer Landells, a pupil of Bewick, developed a mastery in color printing from wood blocks and worked closely with his artists—Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, and Kate Greenaway—to exploit the possibilities and limitations of the medium. Evans demonstrated that it was possible to produce inexpensive illustrated books of fine color and taste.\n\nArtistic styles and technical methods were further expanded toward the end of the century by Oriental influences and the Arts and Crafts movement, with its revival of interest in early illustration. The tradition of the decorated book had waned over the course of the century, only to be revived by the Pre-Raphaelites, in particular the edition of Tennyson's Poems (1857) and the title page by Rossetti to Early Italian Poems (1861). Book decorators and book printers worked toward an ideal of design as beautiful in its own right and its relationship to the whole of the book. As Walter Crane—who was the person most vocal on the subject—writes, \"Book illustration should be something more than a collection of accidental sketches. Since one cannot ignore the constructive organic element in the formation—the idea of the book itself—it is so far inartistic to leave it out of account in designing work intended to form an essential or integral part of the book.\"31 In effect, the illustrator, often collaborating with the author, became more interested in interpreting the text than in decorating the page, and the whole book—from cover to cover—was now considered text. The emphasis on the visual, on the physical attractiveness of a book, created a stimulating book environment.\n\nArt was so prominent in literature that a writer in the Critic (1883) stated, \"The spirit of the times takes much more kindly to the art of the painter than to that of verse-making.\"32 The prevalence of illustration accompanying text in periodicals and novels affected the expectations of the public for the reading experience. The impact was on the serialization process as well as on the framework of illustrated texts. In suggesting character, advancing plot, stating dialogue, and infusing moral significance, the illustrator's creativity shared the novelist's dramatic quality. The inherent rivalry was exacerbated by a practice of matching text to preexisting pictures. The traditional role of text and illustration was reversed as well in the practice of gift books; often the illustrations were completed first, with verse then written to complement the pictures.\n\nReviewers frequently noted the dominance of illustration in contemporary literature. To the Critic (1882), \"A savage dropped into a modern bookstore would undoubtedly suppose literature to be something to look at; something like Wordsworth's Nature, with 'no charm unborrowed from the eye.'\"33 The Literary World (1881) was struck by the proliferation of illustration, once so diffuse, which was now directed toward two distinct lines: \"the pictorial poem and the children's quarto.\"34 The Dial (1880) noted the stock of holiday juvenile books, most of which were illustrated, and commented as an aside, \"A holiday book without pictures is like a Christmas pudding without plums.\"35 To Walter Crane, children's book illustration was the only imaginative outlet available for the creative artist who rebelled against \"the despotism of facts.\"36\n\nHeightened attention to art was perceived by some as a threat to the future of literature. An 1880 essay in Lippincott's on \"Cheap Books\" attributed a decline in quality literature to the ascendancy of Aestheticism. The author noted, \"Literature is out of fashion, and Art is having its day.\" Art was defined not in the abstract but in the commercial sense—\"pocket-art.\" The public was perceived as seeking not the distinguished literary works of the past but handbooks to art, guides to decoration and ornamentation. In such a cultural climate, books lessened in value as well as cost. All that mattered was art and adornment. The writer was concerned that women's advancement would be jeopardized by a preoccupation with aesthetic touches in artistic needlework and china painting, at the expense of higher goals of intellectual merit.37\n\nLack of Rigid Demarcation between Adult and Children's Literature\n\nChildren's books were read frequently by adults in the nineteenth century. Six of the ten best-sellers in the United States between 1875 and 1895 were children's books: Heidi, Treasure Island, A Child's Garden of Verses, Huckleberry Finn, Little Lord Fauntleroy, and King Solomon's Mines.38 The generation after 1880 was the era of Robert Louis Stevenson, Howard Pyle, L. Frank Baum, Beatrix Potter, and Laura Richards. Richards's poetry was often featured in the Ladies Home Journal, suitably illustrated by Kate Greenaway. The genre of adventure fiction appealed to both children and adults, who made popular such works as Ben Hur, Rudyard Kipling's fables, and the scientific fantasies of Jules Verne as well as the magical creatures of Palmer Cox's The Brownies.\n\nThis dual readership was recognized in the reviews. The Atlantic Monthly in 1894 described the phenomenon as \"not juvenile literature but books for the big about the little.\"39 The Times (1889) found that \"some of the stories for younger children are far more amusing reading to our minds than nineteen-twentieths of the three-volume novels.\"40 The Art Journal (1881) distinguished between two classes of children's books: those actually written for children and those catering to \"the pleasure of grown-up as well as infantile minds\" and noted the continuing trend of publishing high-class works \"nominally intended for the little ones, but also catering to the grown-up folks.\"41 Reviewers frequently made reference to books \"delighting all children between the ages of six and sixty,\" or \"pleasing the old as well as the young.\"\n\nYounger children and adults shared picture books. Older children read books whose subject matter attracted a broad popular audience. Some examples included Charles Dickens's novels, G. A. Henty's imperialistic adventures, James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy, which was described in Murray's Magazine (1887) as \"one which appeals equally to the old-young reader and the young-old reader.\"42\n\nOther evidence exists about the breadth of child/adult reading practices. The Pall Mall Gazette conducted a poll in July 1898 to determine the best books for a ten-year-old. As a summary of children's leisure reading, it was instructive, suggesting the longevity of many of the books that children—and adults—read in the late nineteenth century. Most popular was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, followed by two perennial favorites, the fairy tales of Grimm and Andersen. Robinson Crusoe and Little Lord Fauntleroy followed, with The Water Babies—sixth, The Heroes—seventh, The Jungle Book—eighth, The Pilgrim's Progress—ninth. Next came The Arabian Nights, then Through the Looking-Glass, the books of Alcott, Ivanhoe, and Masterman Ready. Fifteenth were the fairy tale anthologies of Andrew Lang, and the final favorites were the books of Mrs. Molesworth and G. A. Henty.43\n\nSome critics tried to construct or preserve the distinction between books for and books about children. The Art Journal (1883), recounting the history of children's books, noted that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland appealed to both adults and children, and its enormous popularity and commercial success encouraged authors to write for both; the drawback to this approach, of course, was that in trying to please both, an author would please neither.44Blackwood's (1896) stated that books that were \"avowedly designed both for children and for grown-up people are apt to please neither.\"45 Mrs. E. M. Field's The Child and His Book (1891) noted that many recent books for children had not been stories for children, but stories about children, of greater interest to grown people than to the young. While her book surveyed older traditions in children's literature, her comments on the contemporary scene showed some concern for the appropriateness of the dual audience. To Field, contemporary artists were, if anything, \"too good.\" As she said,\n\nThe nursery picture-book has a curious tendency to find its way to the drawing-room table and to the smoking-room lounge, even perhaps to the serious study shelf. And uncles and aunts who buy these charming productions \"for the children\" are frequently discovered to be themselves gloating over them in a corner.\n\nWhile admiring the beauty of these books, she found some of the older illustrators, such as Bewick, to be superior in their directness and simplicity.46 Horace E. Scudder, the Atlantic Monthly editor, wrote Childhood in Literature and Art in 1894, which distinguished between books in which the child merely furnished the subject matter and those which were written to be read by the children themselves.47 The American Review of Reviews noted this distinction, adding that many children's books were sources of entertainment to grown-up people, and that no rigid classification should be made.48\n\nBy the end of the century, there were hints of coming changes. Compared to the prime period of \"the Golden Age\" of children's book publishing, fewer distinguished prose writers showed an interest in writing for children. The Dial (1901) noticed this tendency and expressed concern for the adverse effects on children's literature. Recalling that the masters of English fiction a generation ago had not found children's books to be beneath them, the reviewer detected \"a great gulf\" between children's book authors, who \"have little or no reputation in the broader paths of literature,\" and those who wrote for adult audiences.49\n\nA Growing Gender Division\n\nThe decades of the 1880s and 1890s displayed a growing consciousness of gender and a more rigid classification of children's books. Reflecting the broader discourse on gender roles, children's books during this period often dealt with themes of the \"test of manhood\" or \"true womanhood.\" While books for the youngest readers tended to be more gender-inclusive, those for older children divided largely into adventure fiction for boys and domestic chronicles for girls. Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island and Louisa May Alcott's Little Women stood as quintessential examples.\n\nHistorians agree that gender division in children's books became a marked trend in the 1860s, the \"After-Alice\" boom period of publishing. Edward Salmon, a prominent author and authority on children's books in the 1880s and 1890s, addressed the subject in various periodicals and in a collection of essays, Juvenile Literature As It Is (1888). In \"What Girls Read,\" appearing in the Nineteenth Century (1886), Salmon was critical of the writing for girls, not in quality but in subject matter, which lacked the dynamism of boys' books. Domestic dramas, described as \"goody-goody,\" appeared lackluster after the hairbreadth escape of boys' fiction. Girls' books existed as a transition to adult reading and to prepare young women for their social roles ahead. Well-known female authors were discussed, with Alcott the most esteemed. A poll of girls' and boys' reading, conducted by Charles Welsh, indicated a strong preference among both sexes for the works of Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott, and little reference to girls' fiction. While Salmon questioned the validity of the survey, he was struck by the omission and suggested that authors reconsider before producing \"another story on the usual lines.\"50\n\nReviewers began in earnest to differentiate between boys' and girls' books in the 1890s. Current Literature (1899) defined the gender differences by suggesting that morals should be introduced indirectly into stories, so that little boys would intuitively recognize the requisite qualities behind the heroes of adventure fiction, and little girls would be stirred in their feminine stories with \"sweetness and innocence in charming profusion.\"51 While earlier columns grouped fiction for boys and girls in composite columns labeled \"Juveniles,\" separate divisions now appeared. The Review of Reviews, a periodical originating in 1890 to reprint work from other periodicals, distinguished between them in their coverage of \"Gift Literature.\" The Academy, which had long reviewed children's books and had recently begun a Christmas book supplement, announced in 1900 that \"children's books\" had become too large a designation, and that distinction would now be made between \"Picture Books,\" \"Story Books,\" and \"Books for Boys and Girls.\"52\n\nFrom the 1880s, the Times devoted separate review essays to boys' and girls' literature. Of all the reviewing outlets, the Times was the most critical of popular fiction for the young, particularly books written especially for girls. One reviewer in 1885 admitted an unsympathetic response to books written for girls and added complaints about boys' books being monotonous in plot and motive. However, even in the stalest adventure story for boys, there would be some excitement, which contrasted sharply with girls' fiction:\n\nHowever often the hero may be blown up or shot down … although we know he has more lives than any cat, and are assured that he will be returned to his home and parents, nevertheless there is always the exciting question as to how to scrape through each particular peril; while feminine authors writing for their sex seldom dare or care to stir the pulses, except in a quietly sentimental fashion.53\n\nCommenting in 1886 on girls' fiction, the Times, in another prescient note, suggested that publishers would be more successful \"if they occasionally gave a clever authoress her head, remembering that girls, as well as boys, delight in life and action.\"54 The Dial (1899) noted differences in the quantity of books written for boys and for girls. The reviewer found it curious that fiction for adults was largely peopled with female characters, while fiction for youth was decidedly slanted toward boys' interests.55\n\nA Diversification of the Didactic Tradition\n\nThe Victorian age as a whole was preoccupied by moral concerns. As one contemporary essayist wrote in the Bookman (1897), Victorian literature was \"a literature of the pulpit—always self-conscious, always 'moral.'\"56 Children's literature has been dominated by the didactic tradition from its beginnings: the expectation that books for the young must in some way inform and instruct. The late Victorian period has been distinguished in the literature for its departure from the strictures of didacticism. An essay in Saturday Review (1886) marked this trend in the growing rise of fiction for the young. The writer noted the scarcity of books available earlier in the century, citing a brief canon of acceptable works: books by authors Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Anna Barbauld, Lucy Aiken, and Thomas Day; a few periodicals and an occasional annual; and, in more progressive homes, classics like Gulliver's Travels, Arabian Nights, Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe, Tales from Shakespeare, Tales of the Genii, and Rasselas. Now all had changed, as children's books reflected \"the development of a theory of fiction-making for the young at which our own worthy fathers and mothers would have stood amazed, if not absolutely 'aghast.'\" The writers marveled at the abundance of juvenile stories available, in a variety of illustrations and price. Fiction was now considered appropriate family reading. The author estimated that for every one book of fiction read by the young earlier in the century, fifty fictional works were now consumed.57\n\nA few years later, an 1870 Graphic vividly described the developments in this growing genre. Using the image of the nursery rhyme of Jack Horner and his Christmas pies, the reviewer remembered his own childhood reading, where he felt lucky to find \"one plum of incident or adventure amidst the solid mass of suet of instruction and the flour of moral precepts.\" Contemporary children were now able to have their instruction by itself and their amusement by itself, \"unspoiled by any dread of being trapped into 'lessons' in the midst of 'play.'\"58\n\nWhile it has been a commonplace to view the period of the mid-1860s through the turn of the century as \"the Golden Age\" of imaginative literature, there was no great departure from didactic aims in children's books. Indeed, the 1866 Saturday Review noted the appropriation of fiction by religious authors, whereby \"the ingenuous youth of today are to be seduced into the paths of virtue.\"59 Most children's books throughout the period exhibited pronounced moral or instructive themes, although there were changes in tone. Exemplary behavior could shape destiny, given the right amount of persistence.\n\nOne evidence of the survival of didacticism in the late Victorian period was the continued publication of many of the older didactic classics. Books by Sarah Trimmer, Mary Sherwood, and Thomas Day appeared in revised editions, with more engaging illustrations and abridged texts. New editions of Mrs. Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) were reprinted under the more whimsical original subtitle, The History of the Robins, and were published well into the twentieth century. Mrs. Sherwood's The Fairchild Family (three parts, 1817–1847) was reprinted in one-volume editions, with some textual changes. For instance, some of the more extreme religious exhortations were deleted as well as the notorious incident in the book when the children are escorted to a gibbet to see the decaying remains that ensued from quarrelsome behavior. Thomas Day's Sandford and Merton (three parts, 1783–1789) was reprinted many times, translated into French, and appeared in a greatly condensed chapbook edition.\n\nThe persistence of instructional works was stimulated by periodical essays and reviews which revived the childhood classics. In the New Review, and reprinted in the Eclectic Magazine, popular author F. Anstey wrote a long tribute to The Fairchild Family, a work of \"didactic piety\" and \"portentous instructiveness\" that has maintained its popularity and appeal for \"even the most secular-minded child.\"60 An Academy editorial of 1905 touted the older works for their clarity of vision and directness in discipline, as opposed to \"the introspective literature offered to the youth of our day.\"61Blackwood's, surveying the contemporary landscape of children's literature in 1896, commented that \"the collapse of baldly and blatantly didactic literature which took place a quarter of a century ago has not been an unmixed blessing.\" Tracing the evolution of a new tone in children's literature, the Blackwood's reviewer concluded that the children now have the good fortune of possessing excellent entertainment plus \"the pick of the didactic literature, which has lost all its sting.\" The writer praised the quality of the old didactic tales, which children could still enjoy, especially since they would not take them seriously but would \"revel in their archaic oddity.\"62 Biographical essays appeared on the classic Georgian children's authors, including Hannah More, Maria Edgeworth, Anna Barbauld, and Lucy Aiken.\n\nMost discussions of children's books in periodicals of the day included references to didactic intentions. The Outlook included a long essay on \"Literature for Children\" (1883), which was excerpted in the Critic, in which the author stated that \"every story should have an aim or lesson,\" the truth of which would be revealed, not by explicit authorial observation, but by narrative development.63Current Literature (1900) expressed a similar aim: \"Let them have the joy of their childhood in the little time while they may, and make them moral by example rather than by precept—at least, such precepts as are found in books avowedly didactic.\"64 But adults were counseled to be indirect in their religious exhortation, to avoid, in the words of the Critic (1884), \"harping on the golden strings.\"65\n\nThis debate on the virtues of literature was part of the larger discourse on literacy and education. In England, the passage of the Forster Elementary Education Act in 1870, which created state-run elementary Board schools, promoted an awareness of educational needs and created a growing market for the publishers. For the first time the government made provisions to use the power of \"the mighty engine of literature,\" in Matthew Arnold's words. By 1880 Parliament established compulsory education laws for all English children under twelve. The advent of universal education demonstrated the necessity of revising the conventional ideas of moral and social behavior, which had been long established within a settled middle-class society. Educational aims became so dominant that one writer in the Quarterly Review (1886) warned against excluding amusement and reminded readers that it is through the imagination that a child's interest is aroused, without which our \"educational labours will be worthless.\"66\n\nIn America, where expansion of public education progressed since the late eighteenth century, expressions of faith in the social and individual benefits of education also influenced the publishing of children's books. The Critic commented in 1887 that educational works were beginning to overwhelm the market. The writer described the field as a table to which the choicest dishes were brought, where \"didactic blackbirds vociferating the most useful information are packed, as it were, in innumerable tempting pies.\"67Current Literature (1888) viewed the growing list of distinguished writers creating books for children as a landmark of American civilization—\"this attention to the mental needs of the young.\"68Dial (1894) noted the phenomenon as well, remarking that \"some of the best writers, alive to the importance of this field, are sharing in the production of books of information.\"69\n\nThe didactic tradition was being redefined and reshaped into diverse formats. Earlier evangelical concerns were being replaced by a new scientism, and technical changes in Victorian printing made illustration a prominent feature of publishing for children. While most works in the earlier tradition of the moral tales were unillustrated, since illustration was perceived as incompatible with earnest content, contemporary instructive works exploited the potential of the pictorial effect. Picture books offered a new format for conveying instructive messages. The growth of literacy and the expansion of the reading and visually oriented public shaped a diversified object and medium for children's books.\n\nContinuing Debate on Fantasy and Realism in Literature for Children\n\nThe question of whether fact or fantasy was more appropriate reading for children has deep roots in the nineteenth century. The early reformists like Maria Edgeworth and Sarah Trimmer were concerned with educating children to live in a material world and feared that children's imaginations might be damaged by contact with mystical worlds of enchantment and mystery. Fairy tales were a subject of controversy. Fantasy in general had long been considered objectionable because it blurred truth and fiction and because it distracted children from the serious business of learning facts and moral lessons. The first objection, that fairy tales were untruthful, persisted in one form or another throughout the century, although it diminished over time. The second objection, that fairy tales were frivolous distractions from serious pursuits, was particularly pronounced during the first third of the nineteenth century, when children's books were invariably instructional in nature.\n\nThe issue continued to be debated in the periodical press into the late nineteenth century. In 1895, a column in Punch, \"Meeting of Fairy Folk,\" satirized an article from the Educational Times by a Mr. H. Holman, school inspector, who expressed his aversion to the fairy tales for their primitive, immoral nature. Punch then imagined the fairy tale characters meeting to protest their expulsion from the nursery and to defend their intrinsic utilitarian worth.70Good Words also commented on Holman's views, citing his recently published book, Education: An Introduction to Its Principles and Their Psychological Foundations,71 which included a critique of fairy tales as \"intellectual and moral atavism.\"72 While Holman questioned fairy tales for their unrealistic depiction of experience beyond a child's world, William Canton's column in Good Words affirmed that very quality as a virtue, the anticipation of \"a world of delight beyond the region of law.\" To Holman's claim that facts provided satisfying subject matter, Canton argued that the cost was too great: the acquisition of \"a handful of crude facts\" at the expense of \"that divine sense of wonder, that spiritual vision, that imaginative sympathy.\"\n\nPunch could well jest, and Good Words rejoin, particularly since esteemed scholars like Andrew Lang shared their sentiment. As a prominent man of letters, Lang helped to popularize fairy tales and to impart an academic respectability to the field. Current Literature (1890) called Lang \"unquestionably the foremost literary power in London at the present time.\"73 His fairy book series, which began with the Blue Fairy Book in 1889 and ended with the Lilac Fairy Book in 1910, helped to shape a receptive public. To Lang, folktales were not the debased remains of higher literary myths, but the very foundation of them. Lang's name was cited in an essay on fairy tales in All the Year Round (1893), in which the author urged the creation of such tales for adults, described as \"the children who have grown up.\"74\n\nFairy tales became fashionable fare in many literary magazines of the period. Even publications which normally did not cover children's literature included pieces on fairy tales as reading for adults. In Pall Mall Magazine, Evelyn Sharp commemorated Hans Christian Andersen's publishing centennial and acknowledged that fairy tales led the children first and the grown-ups afterwards.75 The Nineteenth Century included scholarly studies of fairy tales, notably \"Cinderella\" and \"Puss in Boots.\"76 The Gentleman's Magazine revealed a newly discovered fairy tale in verse by Charles Lamb.77 The Edinburgh Review (1898) published an extensive history of \"Fairy Tales as Literature,\" which was one of many that expressed what the author called \"the gospel of childhood's imagination.\" Fairy tales were viewed as opening the door to the nursery for the adult, so that the eyes of the child lingered on in the adult as \"eclipsed illusions.\" Even when the adult learned the scientific basis of reality, there would still remain a link to \"the imagination of grown years with the fairy-nurtured imaginations of the nursery.\"78\n\nAmerica seemed more resistant to fairy tale enchantment, and the reviewers lamented this opposition. A reviewer in the Critic (1887) stated pragmatically, \"Fairy-tales are hardly in fashion. If you doubt it, write one for the children's magazines, and see what becomes of it.\"79 An editorial in Current Literature (1900), in defense of fairy tales, expressed the main objection to be an exploitation of the supernatural \"to an objectionable and harmful extreme.\"80 An essayist in the journal Education (1900) argued that \"well meaning but unimaginative teachers\" substituted books of facts for books of fancy, whereas fairy tales had a strong ethical element that expressed symbolically the truths of Nature.81 What was peculiar to American children's literature was an emphasis on practicalities and self-reliance rather than imaginative play, exemplified in the popular \"Peter Parley\" series. These instructional works on the subjects of history, natural science, geography, biography, and mythology featured a fictionalized narrator and generous use of illustrations. As late as 1897, the Dial noted the prevalence of factual books of this type, which they attributed to \"the worship of false gods.\"82 The reviewer lamented the lack of imaginative content, citing barely half a dozen books that \"give the imagination a chance to grow.\" He decried the absence of fairy tales, which had a truth and authenticity that spoke to the needs of generations of children. The reviewer quoted a current essay by Harry Thurston Peck, who called for a \"Renaissance of the Natural, when they will no more be fed with formulas and made to learn so many improving things.\" Dial (1897) noted that children were so satiated with formulas and facts, with \"only practical commonplaces to digest,\" that the imagination was threatened by \"death from inanition.\"83\n\nRomantic Idealization of Childhood and Its Literature\n\nThe 1880s and 1890s were an age of romanticism and escapism. The National Review (1891) repeated the description of the period as \"the Age of Children.\"84Good Words (1904) described the nineteenth century as \"the Children's Century,\" noting the enhanced value placed on the child, as the subject of reform movements as well as scholarly studies and fictional narratives.85Scribner's (1898) explored the literary preoccupation with the child as \"a second childhood in literature,\" in which writers looked back to a \"golden age\" for solace in uncertain times.86\n\nAestheticism had popularized childhood as a contrast to the excesses of modern technology, its commercial vulgarity and industrial blight. The aesthetes of the Queen Anne movement looked back to a greener time, an older time. Country life, not town life, was preferable. The old-fashioned became fashionable. The adjectives \"delicate,\" \"quaint,\" and \"old-fashioned\" were high praise, epitomizing a nostalgic romanticism of the past. The late Victorians envi-sioned childhood as preserving the innocent world that adults had lost. Childhood was considered a separate state of life, and the child became the focus of major imaginative and philosophical speculation—as well as commercial exploitation. Childhood for the Victorians became a symbol of mediation in a period of spiritual crisis. One poem in particular became the cultural text for this mediation—Wordsworth's \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\" (1807). Throughout the nineteenth century, lines from this poem were summoned to evoke sentiment for reform as well as nostalgia. The child was viewed as one who was fresh from God and still remembered a heavenly home, while the aura surrounding childhood faded into the common light of adulthood. Writers indulged themselves in an imaginary return to the simplicity of childhood. Scribner's (1896) noted the outpouring of child literature, which seemed to be more about the child than for the child, more an expression of a state of mind than a dramatic literature. Adults seemed to be receiving, in their words, \"unalloyed enjoyment\" out of this new child literature, which was enjoying a kind of Elizabethan age.87 The Atlantic Monthly observed the trend as well. In a review of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The One I Knew Best of All, the reviewer noted the prevalent fashion of interpreting the life of the imaginative child in terms that produced not \"juvenile literature,\" but \"books for the big about the little.\"88 The Critic (1901) noted in an article, \"The Literary Cult of the Child,\" that the nineteenth century had indeed discovered childhood, that it had awakened to its \"dramatic\" and \"picturesque\" possibilities, and that the effect of the child-cult was not its moral effects but its artistic value.89 The image of the pastoral garden of childhood was pronounced for a whole framework of authors making up \"the Golden Age\" of children's literature: Charles Kingsley, Lewis Carroll, George MacDonald, Louisa Alcott, Richard Jeffries, Kenneth Grahame, E. Nesbit, Beatrix Potter, J. M. Barrie, and A. A. Milne. Children were viewed as having a clear, even heightened vision of the world so that by the end of the century, children and childhood became critical elements in the literary imagination.\n\nSuch romanticism became sentimentalized in the popular culture. The Illustrated London News (1890) described the broad nostalgic appeal of childhood:\n\nThe pleasures of children supply the sweetest part of parents' pleasures; and to many a kindly heart, among good old maids and other childless persons, or the aged whose own sons and daughters have grown up to men and women, there is nothing so delightful, in the whole spectacle of life, as the innocent joys of the little people, without whose presence the world, indeed, would be horridly dull and dreary.90\n\nThe periodicals reflected this iconization of the child in popular culture. In advertising, these images were used to peddle soap, insurance, silverware, or literature. Infants reading a book graced the 1880s cover of Tinsley's Magazine, a literary review of adult fiction. The child was extolled as \"The New Hero,\" in an article by that title in the English Illustrated Magazine (1883), which was revived more than a decade later in the Review of Reviews.91 Articles began to appear on the social welfare of children, on the reading responses of slum children to popular books. An essay in Atlantic Monthly (1901), \"The Child in the Library,\" began, \"He was an only child and a motherless one,\" and then chronicled the great works of literature within the library that provided solace.92\n\nRomanticism was also evident in the historical themes prevalent in art and literature. There was a revival of interest in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, the Regency period that represented to the late Victorians a simpler, more innocent time, just as for the Pre-Raphaelites the medieval period served as an alternative image to its modern age. Grant Allen noted in the Fortnightly Review (1879) \"the many revivals of the Queen Anne period,\" in which are found \"touches of the modern spirit everywhere interwoven with the older style.\"93 The Dial (1899) related the contemporary trend of historical fiction—tales of colonial times—to romantic yearnings for a nation's childhood at a time of enormous growth into maturity. Leaving behind simpler times, the country looked back to its origins, \"when the nation was still in swaddling clothes.\"94\n\nAttention to the Historiography of Children's Literature\n\nThe growing attention to classic books reflected the backward glance of romanticism. As the culture focused on the golden past, it looked to its own literature of childhood. The remembered books of the turn of the century were perceived as more wholesome, less corrupted by the marketplace. The Spectator (1899) examined \"Modern Nursery Books\" and concluded that contemporary authors would be well-advised to return to the old models.95 Mrs. E. M. Field did just that in her history, The Child and His Book (1891), ending her discussion with books of the 1820s.96 Art critic and editor Gleeson White wrote a seminal essay on the history of children's book illustration that consumed the whole issue of Studio(1897–98).97 Andrew Tuer compiled Pages and Pictures from Forgotten Children's Books (1898), Stories from Old-Fashioned Children's Books (1898), and wrote the definitive work, The History of the Horn-Book (1899).98 Facsimiles began to appear of classic books like Goody Two-Shoes, with an introduction by Charles Welsh, noted bibliophile and biographer of John Newbery.99 The first textbook anthology of \"Classics for Children\" appeared in 1885 by the press of Ginn, Heath & Company, to the rave reviews of the Dial.100\n\nEssays on the history of children's literature appeared in a wide range of periodicals, some of which did not regularly cover children's books: the Atlantic Monthly reviewed \"The History of Children's Books\" (1888) by Caroline Hewins, the children's library pioneer who was busily promoting old and new in the Library Journal101; the Strand surveyed \"Grandfather's Picture-Books\" (1892), \"Favorite Books of Childhood\" (1894), and \"Some Old Children's Books\" (1898)102; Eclectic Magazine reprinted an article that appeared in New Review, a tribute to \"On an Old-Fashioned Children's Book: The History of the Fairchild Family,\" (1896) by popular author F. Anstey103; Blackwood's surveyed contemporary literature in \"On Some Books for Boys and Girls\" (1896), concluding with an historical appraisal104; the New England Magazine offered Charles Welsh's \"The Early History of Children's Books in New England\" (1899)105; Critic savored \"Christmas Books of the Past\" (1899), finding most contemporary holiday books \"unwholesome and depressing\"106; Longman's explored \"Some Eighteenth-Century Children's Books\" (1901)107; and, in that same year, Edinburgh Review covered \"Schoolroom Classics in Fiction.\"108 The interest in the origins and development of children's books indicate a maturing field, an independent branch of literature, and a romantic longing for the past—for one's own childhood reading and the childhood of the genre.\n\nAnxiety about the Changing Character of Children's Literature\n\nTo establish a canon of childhood literature became critical as its very foundations were considered threatened. The field was being glutted with cheap publications, products of the new rotary press, which made accessible what was popularly called \"sensational fiction.\" The \"penny dreadfuls,\" as they were known in England, or \"the dime novels,\" as they were known in America, created great turmoil in the press. Many in the educational establishment felt threatened by such encroachment on the perceived purity of literature for the young. To Edward Salmon, \"no element of sweetness and light\" entered their dark forays into bloody revenge and base passions, improbably plotted and crudely executed.109 Others nostalgically looked back to the simpler texts of their childhood and reminisced over the great classics so removed from what was now, in the words of the Dial (1888), \"the large amount of trash which goes under the name of children's literature.\"110 A few argued for greater tolerance of popular literature. One notable example was the essay, \"Sensational Literature,\" in All the Year Round (1892), in which the author examined the conventional wisdom about the adverse effects of cheap publications on culture and morality and refuted the charges in a strong defense of popular literature.111\n\nMore common was the sentiment expressed by H. V. Weisse in \"Reading for the Young\" that cheap literature poisons the mind with its dubious moral tone and unwholesome stimulus; Weisse even suggested that a life of crime might result from such literary consumption.112 The essayist in Outlook's \"Reading for Children\" (1901) pointed out that the matter of reading was of great importance and presented \"so many perplexities\" to parents eager to train the impressionable child.113 In 1886, the Quarterly Review, after surveying new editions of the great classics, called—\"pleads\" is its word—for a guide to children's books.114 The following decade would provide an abundance of such guides, in the way of polls, reading lists, essay reviews and published books. One British newspaper, the Daily News, organized a survey of \"the best one hundred books for children,\" the results of which appeared in the Academy and were reprinted in the Eclectic.115 This cultural discourse over children's books articulated the formation of a canon, a prescribed list of revered texts, which the Victorians were the first to create and redefine according to a complex historical process that involved aesthetic ideals, educational theories, psychological insight, and contemporary fashion. These perceived classics function within the horizons of expectations, which to the late Victorians included a cultural consciousness of children and their growth toward \"life and beauty,\" two hallowed words that were common to contemporary reviews and that, curiously enough, also described the themes of the great works of the \"Golden Age\" of children's literature.\n\nPast and Present\n\nAs the nineteenth century neared its end, children's literature was shaping its identity as a separate genre and fledgling field of no small import. At the same time, children's literature was being shaped by the diverse expectations of its many publics. The literary marketplace swelled with children's books, second only to novels in book production, as the yearly notices in the Bookman indicate. The horizons of expectations for Victorian children's books, as expressed through contemporary reviews and commentary, reinforced the notion of a literature taken seriously. The horizons suggest the deep significance for the Victorians of a literature of childhood.\n\nMy construction of the horizon of expectations yields the following assumptions about the late Victorian, Anglo-American cultural landscape.\n\nFirst, the treatment of children's books as a commodity revealed the profitability of children's books in the marketplace, the appropriation of the gift book genre, and the association of children's books as holiday fare and family reading.\n\nSecond, the elevation of children's books as works of art indicated a dual audience for picture books, an aesthetic autonomy, and a perceived status as the apotheosis of art-culture.\n\nThird, the emphasis on illustration and pictorial effects in literature lent a credibility to children's literature as a highly visual narrative form.\n\nFourth, the lack of rigid demarcation between adult and children's literature created broad appeal for picture books and adventure fiction and encouraged the participation of the literati.\n\nFifth, the growing gender division led to further classification of children's books by gender and age categories, the expansion of the juvenile market, and the disappearance of a unified audience.\n\nSixth, the diversification of the didactic tradition reflected the attention of the commercial trade to secular moralities and the move from narrow prescription and instruction toward the satisfaction of a wider range of interests.\n\nSeventh, the continuing debate on fantasy and realism reflected the overt rejection of didacticism, the belated effects of romantic sensibilities, the conflicts of puritanism and scientism, and the adoption of the fairy tale as a fashionable Victorian genre.\n\nEighth, the romantic idealization of childhood and its literature invested the child with cult status, brought child-study to the forefront of scholarly and popular interests, and distinguished between books for and about children.\n\nNinth, attention to the historiography of children's literature developed out of scholarly interest in book collecting, bibliography, and the book arts, a romantic nostalgia for childhood reading, and a conservative response to a rising tide of pluralism.\n\nTenth, anxiety about the changing character of children's literature was expressed in research and in the criticism of children's books, the articulation of a literary canon of classic works, and the perception of the book as tool rather than art.\n\nThese horizons, in my reading of a vast landscape of discourse, informed the criticism and commentary on children's books in the late nineteenth century. Publishers created a niche for children's books, which became enlarged through expanding literacy as well as periodical coverage in reviews, commentary, and advertisements. The result was an unprecedented reviewing of children's literature in the leading literary periodicals of the day and a heightened awareness of children's social, educational, and artistic development. Specialized children's libraries and children's book publishing followed, along with the professionalism of these new networks.\n\nThe influence of these Victorian horizons persists into the twentieth century. In a continuity of cultural discourse, one horizon leads into another. While modern reading of Victorian children's books differs decidedly from the contemporary reception, we view these books with subtle lines of influence leading the reading backward and forward in time. Their horizons form part of our own. Curious variations of expectations exist in the reception of children's books in the late-twentieth century, some of these which have historical roots in the late nineteenth century. Unlike the extensive coverage of the mainstream literary press, children's books are now reviewed in a vast professional framework of publications and yet virtually ignored by literary periodicals. The public knows only the few leading names of bestselling titles or larger than life figures like Maurice Sendak. Debate continues over the book as text or tool, as instruction or amusement. Fantasy and imagination are suspect. Didacticism is diversified into social messages and technological formats that reflect and shape competing ideologies. In a hot-wired electronic culture, children learn nonlinearity and interactivity. The publishing of children's books is largely directed to adult consumers and a mass market. Multinational corporations, with children's book publishing a small subsidiary of their big business, control the literature of childhood. The book itself as historical and aes-thetic artifact is threatened with extinction. Some predict the end of childhood as we knew it or would wish it to be. Experts construct lists of the best books of the century and debate such canons. Literacy is defined by those who not only can read but who continue to do so beyond the schoolroom. Children and their literature are both marginalized and mythologized. The contemporary interest comes from familiar provinces of psychological, sociological, political, and spiritual needs as the modern age, like the late Victorian, turns a new century.\n\nNotes\n\n1.
