        "text": "Readers don’t need to look much further than English class standards like The Outsiders and Judy Blume’s one-woman cottage industry of iconic characters for accurate coming-of-age stories. (A fact underscored by Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret’s long-awaited film adaptation, which is poised to introduce Blume’s book to a whole new generation.) But for fans of the genre, it’s worth noting: We are amidst another golden age of teen literature.\n\nThe 1990s weren’t exactly a rich time for teen lit — even if characters in books like The Baby-Sitters Club would define the decade for many preteen girls. They were fun, pastel-colored reads where race was boiled down to passive mentions of skin color, sexuality was nonexistent, and the character Dawn was introduced almost exclusively to link social activism with being a killjoy.\n\nOf course, author Ann M. Martin isn’t to blame for The Baby-Sitters Club’s broad-stroke storytelling, which — like Sweet Valley High before it — often veered into after-school-special territory. Emerging from an era that featured both Jerry Falwell, a man so ready to see moral corruption that he once famously villainized the Teletubbies, and Tipper Gore’s Parental Advisory sticker on music, it makes sense that authors would be encouraged to fly under the radar when it came to even mildly questionable content, particularly in the face of marketing tie-ins. (The short-lived 2020 Netflix series would go on to offer fans a breathtaking look at the same characters in a more feminist-friendly, gender- and race-inclusive modern setting.)\n\nAnn Martin, writer of The Baby-Sitters Club series, signs autographs for her teen and tween fans in 1989.\n\nWhile the threat of book bans is still a struggle, the desire to accurately depict the experience of young adults remains. Our reading lists, much like our lives, are influenced by everything that came before us, and thanks to the internet, most can be easily accessed. Authors aren’t just competing against recently released books but also the whole of pop culture, in addition to readers’ personal experiences — forcing a new level of emotional honesty. It’s no wonder that adults are starting to see themselves reflected in the pages as well.\n\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint when teen lit gained its universal appeal. Surely the appearance of a certain young wizard at the end of the 1990s and the introduction of an angst-ridden, vampire-loving teen helped push the genre toward ubiquity. Although popular, these widely read books didn’t always grant their characters the kind of emotional complexity to transcend their genre, or attract readers not already interested in fantasy-based fiction.\n\nFor that, we would need Katniss Everdeen’s help.\n\nThe story of a teenager who willingly volunteers for a fight to the death in order to keep her little sister out of the ring, The Hunger Games wasn’t just a violent coming-of-age trilogy — it was the exploration of what is possible when someone self-sacrifices not only to save those close to her but also an entire nation. The intense action was coupled with equally intense themes, characters who remained realistically likable even in conflict, and a prickly romantic subplot, which made the books a hit, selling more than 100 million copies translated into 54 languages and transforming film lead Jennifer Lawrence into a household name.\n\nThe Hunger Games books and merchandise are pictured in a bookstore in 2012.\n\nDystopian teenage novels weren’t the only things adults found themselves reading in public. (Even if The Maze Runner and Divergent would also go on to make a splash on adult reading lists.) In 2012, The Fault in Our Stars landed in the No. 1 spot on the New York Times best-seller list for seven consecutive weeks. While romance can be a notoriously difficult genre to sell to non-enthusiasts — even more so with two underage leads — John Green’s remarkably unsentimental story of two terminally ill teens exploring sex, death, and the very meaning of life felt remarkably real. It is difficult to hate on two teens whose gallows humor seemingly predicted the rise of internet meme culture. Because of that, the foregone conclusion (sorry, our beloved Augustus Waters dies before the final page) is an earned tearjerker.\n\nFans took note when Green went on to recommend Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell. Like Hazel and Augustus before them, Eleanor and Park are doomed, this time via poverty and gut-churning abuse — two villains that feel even more menacing than sparkly vampires or nameless wizards. They are mismatched both physically and via fate, but while novels 20 years before might have used hand-holding as a placeholder for sex, Eleanor and Park elevate it to an art form, with Park noting, “Holding Eleanor’s hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat.” (It also might be the first literary incident of a male character turning down sex as an act of optimism.)\n\nUnlike single-issue books before it, however, Rowell doesn’t grant her characters a happy ending, or even much of an ending at all. Instead, Eleanor and Park’s great romance is left unfinished, put on ice until the time the characters have more agency and resources —a holding pattern all teens and many adults can identify with.\n\nBut teen literature’s bend toward emotional realities doesn’t rob it of its sense of playfulness, as any fan of Jenny Han’s To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before can attest. Even when demonstrating enough self-awareness to cringe at letters she wrote to previous crushes, main character Lara Jean is still young enough to invent a fake boyfriend — a sweet spot where personal growth (and comedy) occurs.\n\nEmma Lord’s four books, including the recently released Begin Again, are just as much about the emotional ups and downs of finding your path in a world of endless possibilities, off-ramps, and digital mishaps as they are fun, single-sitting reads about occasionally clueless but charismatic teenagers. Red, White & Royal Blue, Casey McQuiston’s smash-hit LGBTQ novel about the blooming romance between the First Son of the United States and a British prince, might lean hard on “the enemies to romantic partners” trope, but its playful rom-com action gives emotions room to develop — ultimately leading to the book’s message that it’s worth being exactly who you are.\n\nAnd while it’s 2023, and perhaps we shouldn’t need to have this conversation, it’s worth noting that representation is exactly why modern teen lit succeeds when previous eras have leaned toward more homogenous stories. No matter who you are or what internal or external struggles you might be experiencing, chances are there’s a book that explores that. Seeing our own journey reflected back to us is a powerful way to not only validate our experiences but also help us move forward. And while it might be especially needed as a teenager, a time when many readers are still forging a sense of self, feeling seen is powerful at any age.\n\nLaura Studarus is a Los Angeles-based travel writer who has contributed to Fast Company, BBC Travel, and Thrillist.
