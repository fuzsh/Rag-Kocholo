        "text": "The Nebula Award Nominated novel, Orphans of Chaos, written by John C. Wright, is described by Kirkus Reviews as a “fascinatingly, dazzlingly…erudite fantasy that trends inexorably toward science fiction.” The plot follows five rebellious teenagers all imbued with certain gifts and powers that set them aside from anyone else. As the plot thickens the five friends begin to suspect that they are something more than human."
