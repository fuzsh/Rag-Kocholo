        "text": "Tom Mead on how his love of classic crime has informed his own fiction\n\nAs a reader and writer of detective fiction, I've taken great pleasure in seeing the resurgence of interest in \"Golden Age\" mysteries over the last few years.\n\nThe term \"Golden Age\" is a fairly malleable one, though I usually take it to refer to mystery fiction from the decades between the world wars. Think Agatha Christie and Dorothy L Sayers. But this isn't a hard and fast definition, and there are plenty of works produced outside the period that can be considered part of the tradition. So what does “Golden Age” actually mean?\n\nEssentially, the term refers to whodunits; vintage-style puzzle mysteries in which a detective is called on to unravel a complex web of deception and identify a criminal from a cast of likely suspects. Reginald Hill, for instance, features a country house crime that is billed as \"the last of the golden age murders\" in his Dalziel and Pascoe novel Recalled to Life (1992). The book is a wonderful cocktail of familiar Golden Age trappings; but does that mean the “revival” is just a question of recycling cliches?\n\nThere's certainly no shortage of them, after all. Think of the eccentric amateur sleuth, the victim with a panoply of would-be murderers, the gathering of suspects in the drawing room for the denouement. I enjoyed myself enormously playing with these popular tropes in my first book, Death and the Conjuror. But while they are all customary features, the Golden Age style can certainly thrive without them.\n\nColin Dexter's series featuring Inspector Morse, for instance, is heavily influenced by the style of the Golden Age, though the novels are not period pieces. Instead, this influence manifests via an ostentatious lexicon, plus a preoccupation with puzzles and word-play. Golden Age-style writing isn't merely a question of getting from point A to point B. It's also about having a bit of fun en route. So often the mysteries themselves hinge on verbal clues, misheard dialogue and the like - hence the appeal to crossword enthusiast Dexter.\n\nI tend to adopt a more holistic perspective. When reading, I try to look at the story as a whole. Is it clever, memorable, entertaining? These are my primary criteria, and they are the aspects that I focus on when writing. The Golden Age is distinctive for the playfulness of its writers, and it's something I've made an effort to embrace in my own work.\n\nIn the writing process, plotting tends to come first. For me, this is usually the most satisfying part. After that comes the tricky bit: the characters.\n\nIndeed, a lack of characterisation is a complaint that is often levelled against Golden Age mysteries - in my view, unfairly. Take Agatha Christie, whose novels were the first Golden Age stories that I read. They appealed simply because they were great stories; I didn't pay much attention to the style. That's because Christie as a novelist is decidedly unobtrusive - she doesn't over-egg the cake. And yet she is a remarkably effective writer. Her characters are vivid - and not just because of their eccentricities. Of course, Hercule Poirot is her most distinctive creation, and her most eccentric. But even though years have passed since I first read the books, her secondary characters have remained with me too.\n\nTake Ariadne Oliver, for instance, the endearing author-surrogate. Then there's the flawed, human hero Luke Fitzwilliam in Murder Is Easy. There is the ill-fated Caroline Crale in Five Little Pigs. The hateful Samuel Ratchett in Murder on the Orient Express. The malicious Arlena Stuart in Evil Under the Sun. They are types, certainly; the universally loathed Arlena, for instance, is an archetypal Golden Age murder victim. But these aren't mere caricatures, nor simply cogs to facilitate the workings of the plot. They are distinct; they are memorable. They live on in the memory once the story ends. To me, that's the mark of not only a great plotter but a well-rounded storyteller.\n\nWith that in mind, I try to give my characters and my plot equal weight. That means ensuring that each is the hero or heroine of their own story. There's no particular skill to it (at least, not where I'm concerned), it's just a matter of considering their lives beyond the plot, and the desires that motivate them. I factor this into every scene, and every dialogue exchange. It helps to make each character more than just a collection of mannerisms.\n\nWhen I'm in the midst of writing one of my Joseph Spector mystery novels, I like to immerse myself in the language and literature of the period. This helps me to emulate the \"voice\" of the Golden Age. I research locations and costumes, relying on photographs to help create verisimilitude. But all of these elements - the language, the characters, the plot, the research - must be in service to the story, and the feeling it evokes in the reader.\n\nIndeed, the key to writing in the Golden Age style is to understand that the genre isn’t just a collection of familiar trappings. It comes from your voice and your style; your sentence construction; the way you convey ideas to the reader. But above all, it comes from the story."
