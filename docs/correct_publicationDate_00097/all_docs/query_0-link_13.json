        "text": "American speculative fiction writer (born 1961)\n\nFor other people with the same name, see John Wright (disambiguation).\n\nJohn C. Wright (born October 22, 1961) is an American writer of science fiction and fantasy novels.[1][2] He was a Nebula Award finalist for his fantasy novel Orphans of Chaos. Publishers Weekly said he \"may be this fledgling century's most important new SF talent\" when reviewing his debut novel, The Golden Age.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn C. Wright was born in Chula Vista, California.[1] He studied the Great Books at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, graduating in 1984.[4] He received his Juris Doctor degree from the Marshall-Wythe School of Law of the College of William & Mary in 1987.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWright was admitted to the practice of law in three jurisdictions, New York, May 1989; Maryland, December 1990. Washington, D.C., January 1994. After his law practice was unsuccessful, he went to work for the newspaper St. Mary's Today.[4]\n\nWright later worked as a newspaperman and newspaper editor[4] before venturing into writing genre fiction. When reviewing his debut novel The Golden Age, Publishers Weekly said he \"may be this fledgling century's most important new SF talent\" [3]\n\nWright also works as a technical writer in Virginia.[citation needed]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nWright's Orphans of Chaos was nominated for the 2005 Nebula Award for Best Novel, losing to Joe Haldeman's Camouflage.[5]\n\nIn 2015, as a part of the Rabid Puppies slate, Wright received five Hugo Award nominations, including three in the Best Novella category (\"One Bright Star to Guide Them,\" \"The Plural of Helen of Troy,\" and \"Pale Realms of Shade\"), a fourth for Best Short Story (\"The Parliament of Beasts and Birds\"), and a fifth for Best Related Work (Transhuman and Subhuman: Essays on Science Fiction and Awful Truth). All his works were ranked below \"No Award\".[6]\n\nOn September 4, 2016, Wright's novel Somewhither (published by Castalia House) received the first Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAt age 42, Wright converted from atheism to Christianity, citing a profound religious experience with visions of the \"Virgin Mary, her son, and His Father, not to mention various other spirits and ghosts over a period of several days\", and stating that prayers he made were answered.[8] In 2008, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, of which he approvingly said: \"If Vulcans had a church, they'd be Catholics.\"[9]\n\nWright is married to writer L. Jagi Lamplighter, and they have four children.[4]\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Golden Oecumene\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Golden Age (2002)\n\nThe Phoenix Exultant (2003)\n\nThe Golden Transcendence (2003)\n\nWar of the Dreaming\n\n[edit]\n\nLast Guardian of Everness (2004)\n\nMists of Everness (2005)\n\nChronicles of Chaos\n\n[edit]\n\nOrphans of Chaos (2005)\n\nFugitives of Chaos (2006)\n\nTitans of Chaos (2007)\n\nCount to the Eschaton Sequence\n\n[edit]\n\nCount to a Trillion (2011)\n\nThe Hermetic Millennia (2012)[10]\n\nThe Judge of Ages (2014)[11]\n\nArchitect of Aeons (April 21, 2015)[12]\n\nThe Vindication of Man (November 22, 2016)[13]\n\nCount to Infinity (December 26, 2017)[11][13][14]\n\nTales of Moth and Cobweb\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Green Knight's Squire\n\nSwan Knight's Son (2016)\n\nFeast of the Elfs (2016)\n\nSwan Knight's Sword (2016)\n\nThe Dark Avenger's Sidekick\n\nDaughter of Danger (2017)\n\nCity of Corpses (2017)\n\nTithe to Tartarus (2017)\n\nThe Mad Scientist's Intern (Forthcoming)\n\nThe Ghostly Father's Novice (Forthcoming)\n\nA Tale of the Unwithering Realm\n\n[edit]\n\nSomewhither (2015)[15]\n\nNowhither: The Drowned World (2019)[15]\n\nLost on the Last Continent\n\n[edit]\n\nTerrors of Pangaea (2020)[16]\n\nGiants of Pangaea (2020)[16]\n\nGods of Pangaea (2020)[16]\n\nOther novels\n\n[edit]\n\nNull-A Continuum (sequel to A.
