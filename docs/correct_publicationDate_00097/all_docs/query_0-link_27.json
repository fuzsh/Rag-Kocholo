Wright Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nJohn C. Wright is an author from California who focuses on science fiction novels. He is an experienced writer who took part in the Great Books program at St. John’s College of Maryland and graduated in 1987. He also went to law school although his legal career did not go all that far. He has since gone on to focus more on his writing work and has produced many stories in a number of series.\n\nHe started writing various science fiction stories in the 1990s and had some of his works published in Asimov’s Science Fiction. He has become a prominent name in science fiction writing as he focuses on space opera literature. This is a format that entails great battles, unique warfare events and romance all mixed into an intriguing series of stories.\n\nHe writes many stories about humanity and how it has grown over the years. One focus he likes to concentrate on entails how society has changed over the years and how even as people continue to evolve, there are concerns over how mankind could be at risk of harm. Much of this is due to not only outside forces from other worlds but also from the behaviors that man engages in today. The stories delve into what it moves to be human and what it takes to preserve that humanity before it is lost.\n\nBook Series\n\nWright has written a number of stories that focus heavily on intriguing space operas. The Count to the Eschaton series is one that is about traveling to a unique world to retrieve an artifact as a means of trying to restore all sorts of balances and order points around the world.\n\nThe Golden Oecumene series is a popular storyline where Phaethon, a mysterious creature, is connected to much of the world through his mind. He uses his mental powers to identify many problems and issues but as it turns out, his mind has been heavily altered as he has cleared out many parts of his memories.\n\nThe Chronicles of Chaos series is another book series from Wright to see. The series is about five orphans who discover that they have numerous distinct supernatural powers. They are distinct features that are strong but as it turns out, they are people who come from strong lineages where they are related to numerous gods.\n\nNoteworthy Books\n\nOrphans of Chaos\n\nThe first of the Chronicles of Chaos books was introduced in 2006. Each of the orphans in the story are people who have their own distinct supernatural powers but they are also people who theoretically should not be able to exist in the same plane with one another. They have been kidnapped and must escape but it turns out that they need to figure out how to use their distinct powers to get out of the situations they are in.\n\nThe Golden Age\n\nThe first Golden Oecumene book came out in 2002. Phaethon is contacted by someone who claims that he is nothing more than a fake. This comes as much of his true memory has been lost. He goes through the galaxy to find his memories and to restore them but as it turns out, it becomes hard for him to do this as there is more to his memory than what he is already aware of. He must travel far through the galaxy to find the answers that he wants as to where his memories could have gone to.\n\nSomewither\n\nThe 2015 book Somewither is a story about Ilya, a young man who works for an institute dedicated to understanding the studies of many mysterious and fantastic creatures. Ilya finds out that many theories relating to how lifesforms are created are indeed true. He has to save a young woman who is related to the main professor. But as it turns out, that woman was abducted by a sinister figure that is interested in intergalactic domination with the intention of taking over more planets.\n\nLast Guardian of Everness\n\nWright has also written some books in the fantasy genre. The Last Guardian of Everness is a 2004 novel that fits into this field. The story is about Raven, a figure who wants to save his wife from death but has to kill an innocent stranger in order to do this. The stranger he is tasked to kill is a watchman of a group that is protecting the planet from an invasion of supernatural forces. This comes as the people of the world have been separated from the dream and fantasy world and that the gods are trying to keep those two apart. As Raven goes on his quest, he discovers that the process might be more difficult than he expected as he learns about the risks that he is putting himself into.\n\nCountdown to Infinity\n\nIn 2017, Wright wrote Countdown to Infinity, a story that looks into the evolution of humanity and where it will go in the future. As a group of space travelers fight a series of aliens, the secrets behind how man has been treated and why humanity is often in danger are exposed. This all comes amid the concerns that society is at risk of serious harm in many forms.\n\nAwards Earned\n\nIn 2016, Somewither earned a Dragon Award as one of the top science fiction novels of the year. This prominent award is given to people who focus on this particular genre of work.\n\nIn 2005, he was given a Nebula Award nomination for his work on Orphans of Chaos. The Nebula award is given by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and is one of the top honors given in the field.\n\nThe story work that John C. Wright has produced over the years shows that he is a very distinct and unique figure in the field of literature. His stories are fascinating and show that he is a very talented figure with a strong desire to look into many parts of the world and universe."
