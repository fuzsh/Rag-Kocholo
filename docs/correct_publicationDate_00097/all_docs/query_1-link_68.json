Really look at how the scenes she creates impacts the written text, and suddenly the drawings will take on a deeper significance.\n\nCindy Helms, New York Journal of Books\n\nEach of these mythical stories is rhapsodically illustrated and adds a dreamlike quality to the seventeen stories...\n\nSeattle Book Review\n\nD'Aulaire's Book of Greek Myths for a new generation, this beautifully illustrated selection from Ovid's Metamorphoses will introduce kids to some of the well trodden myths alongside the less while known stories of transformation.\n\nKatherine N., Porter Square Books"
