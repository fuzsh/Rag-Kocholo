        "text": "I really didn't see any of this in the books... but then I suppose I just read them as a story without looking for anything else or trying to read anything else into them.\n\nTo use Pullman's constant reference, I never saw the Christianity overtones of the Narnia books until it was pointed out to me as an adult.\n\nIn both cases, these books are aimed to children and I think children, like me, don't go looking for hidden messages or agendas. There is no doubt that Pullman does use this beliefs in his writing and I did think that the themes of the series were a little heavy for children, but I doubt it’ll influence them in any way.\n\nI certainly don't think that can be used to sway a child’s belief system. I read the Narnia books as a child and certain didn't turn out to be a Christian of any sorts.\n\nMy opinion of the John C Wright's opinion is tainted by the fact he is a recent convert to Catholicism.\n\nNorthern Lights is a phenomenal alt-history fantasy novel with some fantastic ideas. The armoured warrior polar bears are also cool.\n\nThe Subtle Knife is weaker (introducing our real world to the mix doesn't really work) but there's some phenomenal imagery in the various other worlds our characters visit.\n\nThe Amber Spyglass is a train-wreck of a novel where the Message does indeed take over and starts smashing logic over the head repeatedly. The scene where a guy is sitting in a gyrocopter blasting angels out of the sky with a minigun and rocket launcher is quite astonishingly silly. Pullman also has a ridiculously convoluted ending to explain why Lyra and Will can't be together which is almost exactly the same situation as to why the children in the Narnia books have to die in the final book to find redemption (something Pullman once described as cruel and inhuman done by the author for the sheer hell of it). I wonder if Pullman was going for irony there or if he was just being a bit of a berk.\n\nOTOH, some of Wright's other comments are a bit weird. First of all, there's no such thing as the 'Gunrack' argument. It's called 'Chekhov's Gun'. I'd expect a published author to know that. Also, there are no 'rules' in SF or Fantasy. If you want to break the rules and you can pull it off, then go for it. His suggestion that prophecies not coming true is BS is itself nonsensical: ASoIaF does the 'thwarted prophecy' thing very well, several times, among others.\n\nI read these books about 7 years ago and I honestly did not see the Atheistic views. Did I enjoy the books? Yes. I will agree with Wert and say that they tapered off a bit towards the end, but I still have fond memories of the series, and it stands out a favorite. Having attended a Christian University, and having read the bible since I read this series, I feel compelled to go back and give it a re-read and see if I experience things differently this time.\n\nI will say that the essay written by Wright rubbed me the wrong way. I found myself bristling with his one-sided views. As an adult who works with youth, I think kids could do much worse than to \"stay in school and hate God\" as Wright has written. There isn't anything wrong with kids or adults thinking for themselves, and if Pullman is just writing something different with a non-christian POV there is nothing wrong with a person reading it and making their own conclusions, or with him writing it. I think one thing Wright is forgetting is that people have the ability of choice, and to make decisions for themselves, and can, like Ms. Moon chose to do, stop reading the books if they don't want to hear any more of what Mr. Pullman has to say.\n\nOkay, so I shoved aside my unfair \"Wright can never be right\" gag reflex and read it, and I have to say that while I agree that he exposes some of the silliness of the series very well it mostly comes across as Wright trying to lay down rules as to how a book *should* work. I haven't read the series in many years, and do remember when I was a kid thinking that The Amber Spyglass went off the rails, but really this is just Wright complaining about what he, personally expected to get out of the series and didn't. Which is cool, except that he seems to think that it's a prescriptive for what's fundamentally wrong with the thing. He loses me in particular when he starts talking about how character arcs should conclude, and prophecy. As Werthead's pointed out, prophecy is not law in fantasy and can be used in different ways, and Philip Pullman's character arcs \"should\" end however Philip Pullman pleases, [with bonus points if they, you know, make sense, but the decision to throw a right angle into character development is one which often pays off]. I am with him, though -- at least mostly, on the message over story in The Amber Spyglass. I think that some of the sequences, like the death of the insane Authority, are actually pretty powerful; it's a shame they make little [I won't say no] sense.\n\nI don't feel the need to get all dramatic about the Wright thing, [though I sympathize with those that do], beyond saying that, well, in the space of less than half a year he's managed to make it almost infinitely unlikely that I'd ever try one of his books. I'm torn on the mutation in the boycot that Peter William's brought up: I think that extending the whole thing to Lamplighter might be a bit far. Until she starts parroting Wright's crazy, [and from what I've read of his opinions it really is crazy], I'm more than happy to try her work. [I just finished Prospero Lost.] That said, I'm not sure I would *purchase* her work, [library's my friend on this one], which is unfair to her, but, ... I dunno. Drawing others down with him, indeed.\n\n* end serious off-topicness, I even managed not to go into a huge ramble about what I thought of the Lamplighter book.\n\n________\n\nCOACH HANDBAGS\n\nI read these books about 7 years ago and I honestly did not see the Atheistic views. Did I enjoy the books? Yes. I will agree with Wert and say that they tapered off a bit towards the end, but I still have fond memories of the series, and it stands out a favorite.

I think one thing Wright is forgetting is that people have the ability of choice, and to make decisions for themselves, and can, like Ms. Moon chose to do, stop reading the books if they don't want to hear any more of what Mr. Pullman has to say.\n\nYour misinterpreting what he is saying. Wright's claim is that the Story is clearly driving towards a confrontation with a cruel and tyrannical God (which Wright thinks could be very interesting) but in the third book the Message overwhelms the Story and so instead of a confrontation with a vengeful (evil) God we meet a God who is a drooling idiot. Wright thinks the story was a retelling of Paradise Lost with humans vs. God but that Pullman's message is atheistic (God doesn't exist). Unfortunately Pullman splits the difference and ends up with god as senile idiot which doesn't assist the story or the message. Wright isn't criticizing Pullman for his PoV, he's saying that in the third book Pullman starts preaching in a fashion that undercuts the story from the first two books. In other words, he's criticizing Pullman's methods rather then his point of view.\n\nAs a side note, whether it was because of the \"message\" pushing or not, I did find the last two books a struggle to read and only continued out of a desire to find out what happened at the end.\n\nAfter skimming over some of John C Wrights other blogs, I think it is a great example of why sometimes it is better not to know too much about an authors personal opinions. I've never read any of Wright's work, and I know that we've had a discussion on the forum before about if knowing an authors personal opinions would effect you reading their work, and in this case it really would. I don't read SF anyway, but if I did....\n\nI don't go looking for stuff to offend me on the internet, so it is very rare I hear or read such opinions... I know they exist, but... his opinions pretty much directly clash with mine and franky offend me greatly.\n\nYour misinterpreting what he is saying. Wright's claim is that the Story is clearly driving towards a confrontation with a cruel and tyrannical God (which Wright thinks could be very interesting) but in the third book the Message overwhelms the Story and so instead of a confrontation with a vengeful (evil) God we meet a God who is a drooling idiot.

In other words, he's criticizing Pullman's methods rather then his point of view.\n\nYou may be right. There is a chance that I am misinterpreting what Wright is saying, because after a point, I physically cant read anymore of his essay. But with just a quick reread of the parts of essay I did read and a skim of the parts I didn't read, the interpretation I get is that Wright is saying Pullman's views create the issues with his methods...so to me it seems Wright is saying that Pullman's atheist view is part of the problem.\n\n\"But the message cannot be Taoist or Buddhist or even New Age Spiritualism. Mr. Pullman's message is atheist. He cannot have a reincarnation be shown as a better alternative to hellfire, because he does not believe in reincarnation any more than he believes in hellfire. In order for his message to prosper, materialism has to be the order of the day. All the ghosts of the lordly dead, the honored ancestors to whom the pagan shrines are adorned, also have to be false. The ghosts in a Pullman fantasy world have to be bored, and dissolving back into matter has to be the only ecologically sound proposition. It is a boring and undramatic resolution, unconvincing to the point of idiocy, but it is the only one his message would allow.\"\n\nEither way, I didn't notice any of this stuff when I read the books so the argument is interesting to me. And don't get me wrong, when I read the essay I can see what you are saying too. I am just calling it like I see and it frankly I don't care too put too much more time into what Wright is saying.\n\nI will say that I think Wright's idea is just one opinion, and it seems that whenever I hear of His Dark Materials, it is someone damning Pullman for his Atheist propaganda, which I think is unfair, because it is a fun series, and something I didn't even notice when I read it...if someone does notice that stuff when they read it, good for them, and they can choose to carry on or not."
