        "text": "I have previously written on my favorite science fiction series, Count to the Eschaton Sequence, before. The first book is Count to a Trillion and is an excellent adventure science fiction novel.\n\nThis retrospective was a long time coming. I’ve found John C. Wright’s work fascinating, if not a bit verbose in areas, and creative. He’s held up in some circles as a master of the craft, and it’s easy to see why. He throws out so many creative ideas, it feels like God gave him a double-portion of the creativity he gave most.\n\nI would simply say I admire his work.\n\nThere are six books in the series and according to the reviews they get better as they go on. However, I’ve read them and I can admit that the journey starts off on a strong foot. There’s an issue with the second book being very different than the first, but the first is a fantastic story.\n\nThe third and fourth books are good, but I really feel like the fifth and sixth were the best. The sixth book was actually huge in scale, far grander and stranger than anything else in the series.\n\nNow how do I describe this series?\n\nLet me start with the first book. These books in general deal with transhumanism, the growth of artificial intelligence, and ancient aliens. The main character injects a sort of brain medical solution thanks to the issue of translating an ancient alien message discovered in space. He uses the alien message itself to modify his brain and comes up with a minor version of an improvement to his brain. It’s fascinating. Along with it, though, go echoes of changing history. The astronauts become conquistadors, and the main character becomes a duelist and renegade. He fights the system of technocratic feudalism.\n\nAmidst it all is Princess Rania. She’s the most interesting character to me, and Wright wrote her as a sort of King of Elfland’s Daughter type of character. She’s beautiful, brilliant, and is able to hold her own with the main character. However, she disappears and is seen as a kind of space goddess. It’s fantastic, again.\n\nThe biggest complaints people have are the following:\n\nOne – The main character Menelaus speaks like a Texan, since he is, and it’s hard to read. Well this isn’t a very good complaint, though I admit his speaking style takes time to adjust to. It’s fine, though. The duels, in particular, are interesting chess matches with high stakes.\n\nTwo – The characters are weak. I couldn’t disagree with this more. I get that they are, in fact, archetypes. But that’s actually the point. They become more than they were as a simple individual, and grow insanely. These characters are creatively written and brilliantly grow throughout the six books. It all leads to a fascinating conclusion.\n\nThree – Each book has a cliff hanger, for the most part. This is true, and if you don’t like that, this may leave you with a sour taste. But honestly, it pays dividends.\n\nIn conclusion…\n\nRead the first book. It’s great and if you like it try the second. If you’re lost then, just drop it. But honestly, the entire series is worth a read and I’m so mad that more people aren’t in love with these books like I am.\n\nIf you like my work consider supporting me with a donation! http://www.paypal.me/FrankOrmond\n\nYou may like some of my other reviews:\n\nStory Review: Black Amazon of Mars by Leigh Brackett\n\nBook Review: The Troy Rising Trilogy by John Ringo\n\nBook Review: The High Crusade by Poul Anderson\n\nBook Review: The Lost Fleet Series by Jack Campbell\n\nYou may also like some of my other work:\n\nWorldbuilding: Religion and Philosophy\n\nHow to Tell if Your Writing is Improving\n\nPoetry: “Story Unpublished”\n\nPoetry: “Elfland”\n\nMake sure to follow me on Twitter and Instagram!\n\nI went into Count to a Trillion hearing about how John C. Wright was considered an interesting author. He’s considered controversial in some circles, but I didn’t hear about any of that as I started reading. In that way I avoided having my enjoyment of this book diminished in any way.\n\nScience fiction has been a love of mine for a long time. When I was a kid I read Jurassic Park and got into Michael Crichton. I never stopped reading science fiction throughout my life, taking short breaks and spend\n\ning time doing other times, perhaps, but never halting entirely.\n\nI can honestly say Count to a Trillion is one of the greatest science fiction books I’ve read since Isaac Asimov’s Foundation.\n\nIt seems to be space opera in the roughest of senses: a space princess, starship expedition, secret society, and ancient aliens all play a role. However it’s elevated to a level that I couldn’t do justice with my limited language skills.\n\nThe book focuses on Menelaus, a genius who grows up loving science fiction, to the chagrin of his mother. He’s a Texas-grown duelist who is able to out think people using their smart bullet type guns. After a stint as a lawyer, he ends up being recruited for a ship called the Hermetic, which is setting out on a century long expedition to a diamond star. Menelaus ends up experimenting on himself in order to create the next stage of evolution. In doing so, he misses the trip, remaining in cryostasis for the most part. Once he wakes up, over a century has passed and he is called on to assist in preparing the world for an alien invasion.\n\nThere are many interesting elements to the book including transhumanism, the philosophy of science, and the nature of evolution. The aliens in the universe are not seen so much as felt, and they are so far beyond humanity that it’s scary in a “fear of god” sort of way.\n\nI am a student of philosophy, and as such I was able to understand a great deal of the philosophical underpinnings and thematic elements that Wright wrestles with in his prose (I was giddy when I actually saw the words “Russell-Whitehead”). This isn’t gloating, because I could hardly understand the physics language. The more scientific elements and heavily mathematical elements were beyond my limited understanding, but I enjoyed it none the less.\n\nAbout the only thing I didn’t like was a seeming lack of character development. Menelaus is flawed genius who struggles in adolescence and flourishes as an adult, but Princess Rania is quickly introduced as a love interest without much development at all. She’s interesting, and her mysteriousness might be the part that Wright wanted to emphasize, but it made me (as a reader) unattached to her and unconcerned with her machinations. Also it felt like some characters just sort of drift and change without a catalyst, like Exarchel.\n\nUltimately, I can’t encourage people to read this enough. I would say the only people this wouldn’t appeal to are those who don’t like hard science fiction. It’s clearly a form of space opera, but it’s so advanced that it’s like a genre unto its own. The depth with which Wright explores the universe in this book is incredible and the prose is moving and expertly manipulated. This book is not for everyone, but if you like depth in your science fiction, you will like this book."
