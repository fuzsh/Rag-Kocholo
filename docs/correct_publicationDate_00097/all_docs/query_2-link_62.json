        "text": "“I remember discovering your fantasy novel Last Guardians of Everness with a\n\ngreat deal of delight. Here was a new author who could write with a fine\n\nand imaginative hand. Then I came upon the Golden Oecumene series and was\n\ntotally blown away. What a great vision! This was classic stuff. I wondered\n\nwhy I hadn’t heard more about you. So I picked up the Eschaton books and\n\nread on.\n\nThen came the Rabid Puppy/Sad Puppy debacle and I was heartbroken. Not\n\nbecause your beliefs and mine are so different, but because you and your\n\nfellow Puppies were so *rude*. You, Vox, Day, and Torgenson tore into the\n\nheart of fandom out of sheer cussedness and that’s it. Your arguments for\n\nnominating a slate and violating the unwritten code underlying the Hugos\n\nwere irrational and make no sense outside of the right-wing “reality\n\nbubble.”\n\nAnd as I use No Award to wipe the Hugo Awards clean of the lame and useless\n\nPuppy nominees that you claim are “award-winning” (and I looked too), I\n\nlook back at the Golden Oecumene and remember when you were someone I\n\nadmired.\n\nYours,"
