        "text": "General Earwa\n\nFor all the general Earwa speculation, not specific to any one book - open-spoilers for all content, up to The Great Ordeal and the Atrocity Tales.\n\nNeuropath\n\nTom Bible's life is not what it once was but all that changes when Neil, Tom's college roommate, comes back into his life.\n\nLight, Time, and Gravity\n\nRumoured completed title. “What is the meaning of a deluded life?” So begins Light, Time, and Gravity, a novel told from the perspective of a suicidal English professor, recalling his experiences as a seventeen-year-old working on a Southwestern Ontario tobacco farm in the summer of 1984. Part essay, part narrative, part present, part history, Light, Time, and Gravity is a kind of Notes from the Canadian Underground, a portrait of our culture’s abject failure to create a genuine Canadian identity, as well as a stinging indictment of Canada’s literary and intellectual elites.\n\nSemantica\n\nRumoured title set in a world where nootropic and neurocosmetic techniques have created a class division between those with enhancements and those without, where superhuman Tweakers rebel and are hunted like animals by an oppressive government.\n\nThrough the Brain Darkly\n\nRumoured non-fiction title consolidating Bakker's papers, The Last Magic Show and The Introspective Peepshow, as well as the many lengthy essays and blog posts from Bakker's blog Three Pound Brain, which detail Bakker's Blind Brain Theory. Allegedly co-authored by University of Western scholar, Dan Mellamphy.\n\nThe Forum of Interesting Things\n\nA place for the otherwise unorganized clutter of the Bakker noosphere - for all the papers and links lost to the comments at Three Pound Brain or the nebulous Literature forum of Westeros."
