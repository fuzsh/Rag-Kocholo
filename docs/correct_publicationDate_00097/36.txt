Biography[]

A former attorney, newspaperman, and newspaper editor, he graduated from the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William & Mary in 1987. As an undergraduate, he studied the Great Books program at St. John's College of Maryland in 1984. He was admitted to the practice of law in three jurisdictions (New York, May 1989; Maryland, December 1990; Washington, DC, January 1994). His law practice was unsuccessful and drove him into bankruptcy soon thereafter. He then worked for the newspaper St. Mary's Today. He currently works as a technical writer in Virginia, where he lives with his wife, fellow author L. Jagi Lamplighter (St. John's College of Maryland, class of 1985), and their three children, named Orville, Roland, and Justinian Wright. At the age of 42, Wright converted from atheism to Christianity. In 2008, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church, of which he approvingly stated: "If Vulcans had a church, they'd be Catholics." For several years Wright has made regular posts to a LiveJournal page on many topics, especially sci-fi, writing, economics, politics, and culture in general, often sparking lively debates and occasional controversy[2].
