        "text": "It is characteristic of the new situation that Rudolf I of Habsburg, though he made a number of attempts, never formally achieved the imperial dignity. Henceforward the title of emperor, though it continued, usually did not have the sanction of personal crowning by a pope or papal legate. For a century after Frederick II’s death the only “true” emperor was Henry VII (king from 1308 to 1313), who was crowned in Rome in 1312 by legates of the Avignon pope. Thereafter until the end of the empire there were in all only four emperors who were duly crowned: Charles IV, crowned by a legate in 1355; Sigismund, by the pope in 1433; Frederick III, in 1452; and Charles V, by the pope but at Bologna, in 1530. If the empire and imperial title continued to exist, it resulted partly from the force of tradition, partly from the exigencies of German politics, and partly from fear of the dangerous conflict of interests that any plan for its abolition would necessarily involve.\n\nThe Germans, naturally, were unwilling to surrender hope of regaining something of the empire’s former power: both Henry VII and Louis IV (king from 1314 to 1347; his Roman coronation in 1327 was by representatives of the people) sought to revive the Italian policies of the Hohenstaufen. But the balance had swung against them. France was already striving for the imperial position that Napoleon was ultimately to secure, and France determined that the Germans should not recover the imperial prerogatives. Moreover, in Germany itself, civil war had undermined the power of the kingship, and the elective monarchy was effectively controlled by the princes through the college of electors definitely established soon after 1250. French pretensions to leadership in Europe provoked a last tardy revival of imperialist sentiment both in Germany (Alexander of Roes at the end of the 13th century, Engelbert of Admont at the beginning of the 14th) and in Italy (Marsilius of Padua and Dante), but the emperor Charles IV, a sober realist, drew the necessary conclusions. By then the axiom that “the king is emperor in his kingdom” was firmly established; it marked the end of any universalist dream. Charles set out accordingly to make the empire a specifically German institution. By agreement with Pope Clement V, he formally abandoned Italy; he would enter Rome only on the day fixed for his coronation and leave again the same day. This he did on April 5, 1355. Then he turned to the definition of the German constitution, particularly the rights of the electors, in the Golden Bull of 1356. The change was reflected in the final evolution of the empire’s title: Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanicae (Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation). This title, which appears under Frederick III (king from 1440, emperor from 1452 to 1493), indicates that the emperor’s powers were limited to his German lands. In 1508 Frederick’s successor Maximilian I, unable to go to Rome, assumed with papal consent the style “elected emperor” or “chosen emperor” (Latin imperator electus; German erwählter Kaiser).\n\nThe effect of the Reformation\n\nThe history of the empire after the promulgation of the Golden Bull may be treated briefly, because from that time it is essentially a part of German history. It is true that memories of an imperial past continued to have an influence on German thinking and that in the Habsburg lands there was a sense of belonging to a multinational empire. A few emperors—Sigismund in the 15th century, Charles V in the 16th—may even have thought to recover part of the old imperial prerogative. It was also possible to make something of the empire’s leadership of Christendom against the Turks. But institutionally the role of the empire was almost continuously whittled away. After the failure of the project of imperial reform sponsored in 1495 by the elector of Mainz, Berthold of Henneberg, the hope vanished of endowing the empire with permanent institutions effective beyond the limits of the different principalities. The Reformation entrenched the princes firmly in their rights and accentuated their autonomy.\n\nWhen Charles V, opening the Diet of Worms in 1521, declared that “the empire from of old had not many masters, but one, and it is our intention to be that one,” he was shutting his eyes to the realities. The extent of his dominions was imposing, but they were a weak dynastic agglomeration; and though Charles championed the Roman Catholic Church against the Reformation, his empire was neither in spirit nor in fact a revival of the medieval empire. When he accepted the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 and abdicated in 1556, the change that was begun with the accession of Rudolf I of Habsburg was completed. With Germany split into two religious camps, the emperor was little more than the head of a religious faction. Furthermore, after Sigismund’s death (1437), with one short intermission for Charles VII from 1742 to 1745, the imperial crown, though in theory elective, was hereditary in the Habsburg dynasty of Austria; and this fact produced a cleavage of interests between emperor and empire.\n\nThe end of the empire\n\nFrom 1556 until its end under Francis II in 1806 the empire meant little more than a loose federation of the different princes of Germany, lay and ecclesiastical, under the presidency of the House of Habsburg. After the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), no emperor again attempted, as Charles V had done, to reestablish a strengthened central authority; and the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 marked the empire’s final organization on federal lines. Yet, even at the end, the empire had loyal adherents, particularly among the small knights and noblemen of western Germany, who regarded it as their safeguard against princely absolutism; and its role was not so entirely negative as is sometimes thought. Its loose structure still suited to some degree the cosmopolitan spirit of the 18th century. But with the French Revolution, and the intensified nationalism that followed, it became an anachronism.\n\nAs far back as the end of the 13th century, French kings had been scheming to annex the title as well as to absorb the outlying territories of the empire. With Napoleon’s rise to power this ambition came within reach. Posing as the new Charlemagne (“because, like Charlemagne, I unite the crown of France to that of the Lombards, and my empire marches with the east”), he resolved in 1806 to oust Francis II from his title and to make the Holy Roman Empire a part of the Napoleonic “new order.” He was anticipated, however, by Francis II, who in 1804 had assumed the title “hereditary emperor of Austria” and who, resolving that no other should wear the crown that he was powerless to defend, resigned the old imperial dignity on August 6, 1806.\n\nSo perished the Holy Roman Empire. The extent and character of its influence will always be a matter for debate, but it left a deep imprint on Europe. Nor did it cease to be influential after its extinction. The debate about the medieval empire was an ideological background to the creation of the Second Reich, or German Empire, in 1871, and even Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich drew sustenance from memories, often thwarted and perverted, of Charlemagne and Otto the Great and Frederick II.\n\nGeoffrey Barraclough The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
