        "text": "In the 16th century intellectual, religious, cultural, and political views divided Catholic Europe and caused the Protestant Reformation. The way things turned out still effect and determine the structures and beliefs to this day. People like John Calvin, Henry VIII, and Martin Luther challenged the Catholic Church on how it delivers Christian views. They disagreed on how the religious and political power was being distributed into the hands of the Bible. The argument began wars, persecutions and a Counter Reformation. Most historians usually believe that the start of the Protestant Reformation was around 1517 when Martin Luther published “95 Theses”. The ending is anywhere from 1555 which would allow the coexistence of Catholicism\n\nThe Thirty Years War was an incredibly important event that took place during the 17th century. It caused phenomenally high destruction rates throughout Europe, especially Germany. These battles that make up the Thirty Years Wars were extremely influential towards the European people and governments. The Thirty Years War seemed to have many political factors that fueled its beginning and continuation but the religious factors were more prominent and important to the progression and completion of the war.\n\nBy the year 1860, the bloodshed that would develop into the Civil War had become inevitable. After being delayed through compromise multiple times, the election of Lincoln as the 16th president proved to be the final straw in the war over sectional conflicts. Since the invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century by Eli Whitney, The North and South began courses with two opposite trajectories, both economically and socially. Countless events from 1800 to 1860 drove the regions further apart, and although the North and the South tried to reconcile their differences with compromises in 1820 and in 1850, both attempts failed in the end.\n\nAlthough he absolutely opposed Martin Luther and the entire protestant reformation, his actions were crucial in the spread of the reformation. When Emperor Charles V agreed to a revival of the imperial Supreme Court and the council of regency and promised to consult with a diet of the empire on all major domestic affairs that affected the empire, he helped the development of the reformation by preventing unilateral imperial action against the Germans. Overwhelmed by all the land he controlled and the Habsburg wars he was involved in, Charles V was not able to stop Luther from reforming the church. He eventually gave up and signed the Peace of Augsburg on September 25, 1555. The Peace of Augsburg was the legalization of Catholicism and Lutheranism in the country of Germany. As a result to this peace treaty, the protestant reformation was spread throughout Germany and began to\n\nIn the Treaty of Paris, defeated France and Spain sought peace with Britain after seven years of conflict over American land. Although the Seven Years War is a large event in history, one can argue that the events created by results of the war concluded to be more significant. The results of the Seven Years War, or the French and Indian War, affected the lives and political state of the British, the colonists, and the Native Americans. The French and Indian War left British victorious but in debt.\n\nDue to the war in the America’s during 1754-1763, known as the 7 Years War. The British technically won the war, nevertheless also fell into debt because of the war. The British king and parliament felt that Britain must assert control back over the colonies. In attempting to assert control, the British implicated several acts which the colonist felt their freedoms were being restricted, which resulted in complications of protesting. Parliament felt justified implicating these acts for a couple reasons, the British came to the colonist aid during the 7 Years War and collected a great deal of debt, and Britain needed to reassert themselves as the rulers of the colonies.\n\nIt is difficult to determine when the Thirty Years War really began. Ultimately, a culmination of events led to the tension between the countries of the Ottoman Empire. Prior to the war’s beginning on May 23, 1618, Europe was in a state of religious, political, and imperial turmoil. The Lutherans, Catholics, and Calvinists were all competing for religious dominance. Political leaders tried to advocate for their religions in the elections. There was much controversy regarding the new kings of Bohemia and political stress between the Bourbons and the Hapsburgs. War was\n\nThe Seven Years War marked a huge turning point in American History, as it changed the outlook of the British, making them branch away from their salutary neglect, and convinced the Americans for Independence as the British started changing their way of enforcing taxes and laws. The War changed the people's opinions in both Europe and America. Americans started to despise the British, while the British started to resent the colonists because they did not help with paying the war. The changes and similarities that occurred before and after the war led to a more enforced government, as Salutary Neglect was forgotten, led to resentment towards each other as the British thought the war debt was left to be paid by the colonists, and became a turning point as colonists started to struggle against Britain's imperial balance of power in North America and the continuity of Native Americans fighting for their land.\n\nThe thirty years war was yet another example of religious strife in Europe. Rudolf II the ruler of Bohemia tolerated Protestants in his country, but his successor Ferdinand II did not and pushed the work of the counter reformation. The Bohemians rebelled, and Ferdinand exiled and executed them. They were told to register and sell their property and leave within fourteen days to \"prevent further trouble and embarrassment.\" (Dietrich). When the truce between Spain and the Dutch ended, fighting in Germany and the Netherlands resumed. Ferdinand then issued the Edict of Nantes (which he would later suspend due to opposition by nobles), which gave Catholics back all their land that the Protestants had taken. France then entered the war, seizing the opportunity to attack their opposing Catholic power, the Hapsburgs. They also attacked Ferdinand. One third of Germany's total population was killed, but this was not the\n\nThe Seven Years’ War, also known as the French and Indian War in the colonies, was the beginning of outward conflict between the British and French over North American colonies. Most Europeans viewed the Indians as a means to get something they wanted; they were pawns during this struggle in North America. During the 18th century, there were many alliances and discord among the Indians and the Europeans. The demise of many alliances was the lack of trust and suspicions of betrayal. The Europeans were a dominating force in the French and Indian War affecting aspects of territory, trade, and government in North America.\n\nThe second or Danish Phase lasted from 1625-1629. It received its name from the involvement of the king of Denmark, Christian IV. He was a Lutheran, so he supported the Protestants. Other reasons also include political rivalries with the Holy Roman Empire . The country of Denmark had enormous wealth that was unmatched anywhere else in Europe. France, under Regent Cardinal Richelieu, agreed to subsidize the war. Cardinal Richelieu was indeed a Catholic, but\n\nThe Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between Kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the"
