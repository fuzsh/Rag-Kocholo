        "text": "The massive disturbance that the Reformation caused had an enduring impact on European politics. After the Catholic Church considered Martin Luther a “protestant,” Europe became divided along confessional and territorial lines. The religious chaos of the period led to warfare within most states and between many. This warfare, especially the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648), destroyed Europe. For example, the Lutherans and the Holy Roman Empire ended a war in 1555 with a stalemate to sign the peace of Augsburg. The most crucial part of this treaty was “cuius regio eius religio,” which mean’t whatever political entity controlled an area had the right to decide what religion that area would follow. The Peace of Augsburg was only intended to be temporary, but it caused many unintended issues such as the split of Germany until its unification in the 1860s.\n\nThe Schmalkaldic League was “an alliance of Lutheran princes and cities that pledged to protect each other from any religiously motivated attack.” In the beginning, the Schmalkaldic League was made up of eight princes and eleven cities; if one member of the league were to be attacked because of their religion; all the other league members would unite and support them (The Schmalkaldic League: Reformation War). The league was formed in response to the threat in 1530 by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to get rid of Lutheranism within the empire and have all return to Catholicism. It was Charles V’s refusal to acknowledge the Augsburg Confession from the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 that lead to the formation of this league. Amongst the members, the league had a substantial military of 10,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. The Schmalkaldic League got its name from the location in which it had formed; they had formed in the small town of Schmalkalden, Germany (Schmalkaldic League). Due to other things happening during this time, Charles V did not have a lot of time to focus on the Schmalkaldic League, which led him to grant the league “free exercise of their religion until a church council or national diet could decide religious issues” (Graves). “The creation of leagues was common in the early modern Holy Roman Empire, especially during the Reformation” (The Schmalkaldic League: Reformation War). Even though the Schmalkaldic League had a large military force and was ready to\n\nThe protestant reformation was a significant turning point during the 16th century that completely revolutionized the Roman Catholic Church. The “reformation” was launched in 1517 when a German monk by the name of Martin Luther posted his “95 Theses” on the door of Castle Church in Wittenberg. The main ideas of this publication was that selling and buying indulgences was wrong and that the pope has no power over purgatory. These 95 revolutionary opinions formed the basis for the protestant reformation which revolutionized western civilization over the next three centuries. Although most people believe these reforms only affected religion, the reformation also impacted political life. Politics played an enormous role in the reformation due to the fact that political rulers wanted to extend their power and control using the church. Throughout the course of the protestant reformation, political authorities such as Emperor Charles V and Henry\n\nThe Pope took on the power, rule and authority over the Christian Church, over the Holy Scriptures and over the Word of God. Martin Luther talked about the enemies of the Pope, some such as Henry VIII, the King of England, Prince Georg of Saxony, Satan and the King of Denmark. By having these enemies it caused the Pope to lose power. It also stated that the Pope believed one thing but really that is not the truth.\n\nThe shifting beliefs with the Christian church had severe second and third order effects of power in Europe during the Protestant Reformation. It started with Martin Luther when he challenged the Catholic policy, especially the ones about money; he accomplished that with the publication of “95 Theses.” As a result, Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic church and joined forces with Germany. However, German peasants started a war based on Luther’s teaching leading to the creation of Lutheranism as the state religion for Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltics. Other countries had similar thoughts as Luther, and many religions erupted thus shifting the power balance. During the Protestant Reformation, “Political economy, nationalism, Renaissance\n\nAlthough political instability and various social crises contributed to the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire, economic misfortune was the primary cause of the collapse, as a decrease in trade and agricultural production resulted in specific social and political problems that made the Empire vulnerable to invading barbarian tribes. Poor harvests, inflation, and a pressing tax burden severely damaged the economy of the Western Roman Empire. Farm production declined during the late Third Century as small farmers could not compete against the barbarians and Roman commanders who ravaged their fields and stole their livestock. The monetary system was also troubled by debased coinage and most significantly, inflation. The denarius, the\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church responded treatment of Luther, Huguenots in France, relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor, the Jesuits and the Council of Trent, treatment of Galileo and other scientists very differently. Luther was called before Emperor Charles V to recant his beliefs. Although some German Princes sided with Luther, it was still declared an outlaw. He protected by a German Prince Frederick the Wise. He translates Erasmus’ Greek Bible into German. Holy Roman Emperor and the RCC were political allies. Prince’s allied with Luther to indirectly challenge the emperor. Huguenots in France worked to reform the rest of France, but the Catholic King Henry III was not about to let that happen. King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, this resulted in driving out hundreds of thousands of his best citizens abroad. The monks at Cluny were challenging the power of the Holy Roman Emperor, there was also the idea of separation of church and state. By 1050, King Henry III appointed the Pope he liked which was Clement II. After his death the archbishops were able to elect the Pope. Henry IV had a serious threat to his stability. He made his bishops swear loyalty to him. When Gregory excommunicated Henry he begged for forgiveness and he got it; after Henry was back to placing bishops, he was excommunicated again. The Germans were eager to see a weakened king siding with the church. The Holy Roman Empire was no way united, still very strong, but they had no control over its\n\nThree of the many major causes of the fall of the Western Roman Empire was the decline in the loyalty of the army during the second century, the invasion of the Huns, and the moving of the capital from Rome to Constantinople by Constantine. These causes drained power from the Roman government adding to its instability and inability to deal with the problems it was facing in the fourth and fifth centuries. These resulted in the collapse of Roman power, the conquering of Rome and the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 A.D. The loyalty of the army played a major part of the Roman collapse.\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was an empire in central Europe consisting of many territories and ethnicities. Once very powerful, the empire’s authority slowly decreased over centuries and by the Middle Ages the emperor was little more than a figurehead, allowing princes to govern smaller sections of the empire. Though the various ruling princes owed loyalty to the emperor, they were also granted a degree of independence and privileges. The emperor, an elected monarch, needed the allegiance of the princes and other aristocracy to support him, in turn giving them power or money. This tenuous allegiance between powers was greatly strained in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as religious reform dominated Europe and religious tensions\n\nThe next major cause of the Protestant Reformation was the creation of Lutheranism and the Lutheran Church. The Lutheran Church changed the entire culture in Europe. It caused society as a whole to live more wholesome lives by cutting down on sinful acts and criminal offenses. The Church began to draw the line on what was acceptable and what was not. People began to live more holy lives. Since religion had so much to do with the government and politics at the time, it affected how governments had to be run because they could no longer pay off the Church to get their way. This caused a major political effect on the Catholic Church. Power struggles began to influence how rulers would deal with the Church. Luther’s"
