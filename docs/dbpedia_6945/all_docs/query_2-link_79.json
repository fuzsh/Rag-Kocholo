        "text": "Our inflation calculator works for amounts between £1 and £1,000,000,000,000 (£1 trillion).\n\nFor example, imagine you want to know what goods and services costing £23 in 1975 would have cost in 1985:\n\nThe price index for 1975 = 17.78\n\nThe price index for 1985 = 44.6\n\nThe calculator increases the cost in 1975 by the change in prices between 1975 and 1985 with this formula:\n\n\\[\\textit{Cost in 1985} = \\textit{Cost in 1975} \\times \\frac{\\textit{1985 price index}}{\\textit{1975 price index}} \\]\n\n\\[£57.68 = £23 \\times \\frac{44.6}{17.78}\\]\n\nSo the cost in 1985 of the same goods and services has risen to £57.68.\n\nThe inflation calculator also tells you the average yearly inflation rate between two years or months (current year only). The formula for this, again using the example of 1975 to 1985, is:\n\n\\[\\textit{Average inflation} = \\left( \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\textit{1985 price index}}{\\textit{1975 price index}} \\right) ^{0.1} \\right) - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\n\\[9.6\\% = \\left( \\left( \\left( \\frac{44.6}{17.78} \\right) ^{0.1} \\right) -1 \\right) \\times 100\\]\n\nThis looks a bit complicated, but it just shows that on average prices rose by 9.6% a year between 1975 and 1985. By the way, “0.1” means that the change in prices is ‘raised to the power of one tenth’ to calculate the average inflation rate over ten years.\n\nOur inflation calculator is designed for illustrative and general reference purposes only.\n\nThe calculations are approximate and only give a rough guide to the buying power of the pound for goods and services purchased in the UK.\n\nWe use several sources to create our calculator. For dates from 1750 until 1948 we use the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) Composite Price Index. Before 1947 no single price index exists so the ONS use price data linked together from several different published sources. We use the ONS’s estimates of the Consumer Price Index from 1949 onwards, which we use to update our calculator each year.\n\nFor dates between 1209 to 1750, we use the cost of living index kindly supplied by Professor Greg Clark.\n\nThere are a number of other price indices available. You can find some alternatives in our A millennium of macroeconomic data spreadsheet and Professor Clark’s study The Macroeconomic Aggregates for England 1209-1869.\n\nThe website measuringworth.com has a calculator based on different measures of comparative value such as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, average earnings, and GDP per head. These measures may be more useful depending on what you’re trying to do. For example, a calculator based on average earnings might be better if you want to compare wages, income or wealth over time.\n\nOver long periods, the definitions of goods and services included in the price index have changed. For example, a family’s food and clothes today are very different to those of a typical family a hundred years ago.\n\nChanges in household spending also reflect higher incomes and the wider range of goods and services available to buy today. These new goods and services are included in today’s price index, but not in earlier versions.\n\nOverall, these features of the data mean that comparisons of prices further back in time and over long periods are less accurate than comparisons over short periods in recent years."
