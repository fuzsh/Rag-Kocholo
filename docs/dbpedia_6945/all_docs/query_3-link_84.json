        "meta_description": "Between 1583 and 1700, there were two calendars in use in the Holy Empire, with a gap of ten days between them. It is generally said that one of the calendars, the Gregorian, was Catholic, and the other, the old Julian calendar, was Protestant. There is no theological reason for this division, nor is it absolute, a fact demonstrated by the case studied in this article. In 1668, the Elector of Brandenburg (Protestant) imposed a transition to the (supposedly Catholic) Gregorian calendar on his subjects of the principality of Minden in Westphalia (with a Protestant majority). The arguments of the various protagonists in this decision and the debates it engendered reveal synergies and shifts between the religious and other domains (including economic), warping these categories that are often reified in historiography. Moreover, the debate shows that Minden’s border was embedded in the variety of scales that were mobilized according to their particular interests by various actors. This case study thus permits us to re-situate spatial and category-specific boundaries – which seem consubstantial with the notion of the territorial State in the Empire – in a complex social game that can only be understood through a wide range of sources.",

        "text": "Calendrical differences and the social history of confessions\n\n2But it is indeed from this angle that I study the difference in calendars. This very real gap, embedded in daily life and materialized by a change of date at confessional boundaries, is not based in doctrine, or even religion. The calendar itself is an adiaphoron, a dogmatically neutral thing, and all agreed on this at the time. The paradox of an omnipresent confessional marker with no religious basis is what makes it an interesting subject for my endeavor to develop a social history of categories of religious affiliation in the Holy Roman Empire of the modern era.\n\n3This endeavor gradually led me to challenge three ideas that engender particular choices in methods, documentation, and interpretive frameworks. Their proponents present these three ideas as empirical, thus neutral, classifications, when in fact they are always related to theoretical options, even if they sometimes go unnoticed. Secondly, these ideas are located at the very point where the themes historians use to sort their work into specializations overlap with the issues manipulated by actors of the period in the controversial invention of the frames of confessional coexistence. This intersection of the categories of the time and the categories of historians is what makes things difficult, and is also why there has to be a shift relative to each.\n\n4It is first of all a matter of deconstructing the ontology of the religious fact postulated by some of the actors in these confessional confrontations, and also by the niche of historiography devoted to the subject. The latter is especially pronounced in Germany, where Protestant and Catholic history are still rather distinct and practiced in part in schools of theology. This approach sees a confession’s characteristics as resulting from its core doctrine and the program of orthodoxy and orthopraxy implemented by its clergy. Deviance, the particular logics of inter-confessional relations, and the social dimension of the construction of confessions are rejected to the margins of historical work. I set out to do the opposite, to avoid immediately attributing explanatory primacy to the religious, which could obscure the diversity of uses of categories like “Catholic” and “Protestant.” From this perspective, the difference of calendars is a good vantage point for analyzing a socially rooted distinction between confessions, because it establishes a clear and readily perceptible threshold between users of the Julian and Gregorian calendars completely devoid of any doctrinal basis.\n\nThe Principality of Minden\n\n9This article focuses on one single case, which is far from covering the full range of directions that my research has taken but it does provide a clear example of the differentiated uses various social actors made of political, confessional, and spatial categories where calendars are concerned. In 1667-68, the Elector of Brandenburg – not yet King of Prussia but already in one of the most powerful dynasties of the Empire – imposed use of the Gregorian calendar on some of his subjects: those of the Principality of Minden. The decision did not concern all of his territory, the rest of which kept the Julian calendar. It led to reactions and debates that left patchy but consequential traces in the archives. I found them in two places: first in a file in Berlin that included correspondence between the government of the Elector and Minden local government, and then in the archives of Münster, where a few items of more disparate origins are preserved. There are thus several voices and several levels represented in relation to the same issue. The principality of Minden was tiny, barely 1000 km2, and has not inspired frenetic historiographic activity, but when the Gregorian calendar was introduced there, it shook up the accepted equivalencies between political obedience, confessional affiliation, and the stability of boundaries.\n\n12To recap: in 1668 a Protestant Elector introduced the Gregorian calendar in an almost entirely Protestant principality. On top of that, this situation is very similar to those of other examples of the transition to the New Style between 1583 and 1700 (the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück had a very colorful confessional landscape; in Palatinate-Sulzbach the Prince was still Protestant when he established the Gregorian calendar in his Protestant principality; the town of Höxter was bi-confessional but its council unanimously decided to adopt the New Style). In all these instances, the choice of calendar clearly reveals interactions between the political and the religious that leave us no choice but to stop thinking in terms of an equivalency – too often considered to be automatic – between princely power and confessional attribution (a reflex driven by the formula cujus regio ejus religio).\n\n14To illustrate how the differentiated and sometimes tacit handling of the confessional, spatial, and political categories of the Holy Roman Empire of the seventeenth century was expressed through the calendar in this exclave, I will focus on just a few chosen texts rather than detailing all the documentation.\n\nScales and issues\n\n15It was not a foregone conclusion that the Grand Elector, considered to be the champion of Protestantism and Prussian unity before it even existed, would introduce the “Catholic” calendar in a Lutheran principality. What were his motivations? The document in which they are presented the most clearly is the “patent” (the Elector’s decision) of 21 January 1668, marking the end of the decision-making process:\n\n21 Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin, I. HA Rep. 32 Nr. 83 10535, “Fürstentum Mind (...)\n\nSince becoming aware a certain time ago of the manner in which the different calendars in our Westphalian territories have caused great confusion and disparities between our subjects in terms of their activities and commerce, as in other terms, we have decided to henceforth introduce and put into use the new calendar in our Principality of Minden and in our town of Herford, two places where it had not been in use until this time, with the main aim of establishing between two territories, that form a whole and border one another, uninterrupted concord, good conformity, and equality likely to favor the development of trade and the maintenance of harmony.\n\n17The Elector did not speak of confession, however. He only mentioned “uninterrupted concord,” the “development of commerce,” and “the maintenance of harmony.” He prioritized economic concerns with the revitalization of trade and activity in his lands after the ravages of the Thirty Years’ War. By denouncing the obstacles raised by the diversity of calendars, he picked up on a commonplace notion that from the outset typified thinking (especially at the Assembly of Imperial Estates) on the necessity of finding a uniform way of designating time. In this statement, the Elector used a discourse that was common at the Imperial scale, applying it to a scale that is neither a territory nor the full extent of his dynasty, and he painstakingly avoids any confessional reference, as seen in the neutral expression “new calendar” instead of “Gregorian.” Most of all, by asserting his ability to change the calendar on his own initiative, he implicitly espoused the idea that the computus was purely political, irrelevant to the rules governing confessions that required the Principality of Minden to continue using the Julian calendar because it was in use there in 1624 (the normative year raised to the rank of eternal rule by the Peace of Westphalia for sorting out the confessions to be practiced publicly). The Electors of Brandenburg sided with the contrary opinion in 1583; they would proclaim the religious character of the calendar on subsequent occasions. The value of confessional and political categories depends on what one wishes to do with them.\n\n18The Elector’s patent thus settled a controversy over calendars, when in fact they were not remotely settled because most of the conflicts concerned whether or not the issue should be included under the prerogatives of the established dominant confession. The Elector did so in the name of the hierarchy of boundaries, the removal of confessional markers from the calendar, and the primacy of making the territory both regionally and economically uniform at a specific scale. This position is not without contradictions, however: it does not cover the whole Empire, where the Elector would never have advocated the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by all Protestants to facilitate the “development of commerce,” and it ignored another boundary – the one separating the Principality of Minden from the other surrounding Protestant principalities, or rather, the one harboring multiple ties with these neighbors.\n\n19This other conception of the regional scale is mobilized in a second text. It is a petition from the municipal council of the town of Minden to the Elector, dated 7 February 1668. They request that the Elector ask himself…\n\n23 The county of Hoya has been part of Brunswick-Luneburg since 1582.\n\n24 Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin, I. HA Rep. 32 Nr. 83 10535, “Fürstentum Mind (...)\n\n(…) if the introduction of the calendar might not run the risk of leading to notable confusion and trouble, and paralyzing a good share of the commerce and good sense observed thus far with neighboring lands, considering the fact that the burghers from here do most of their business with the subjects in the border areas of the county of Lippe, Schaumburg, Hoya, and the Hesse lands, where the old calendar is still in use at this time.\n\n20The neighbors mentioned in this text were carefully chosen. All are very close, a few hours walk at the most. None of them are among the Elector’s other Westphalian territories. However, they had long-running ties with Minden, especially the town, where they helped the Protestants assert themselves with their Prince-Bishop in the sixteenth century. They are also all Protestant, a fact the note carefully neglects to mention. As is often the case, the boundary was complicated and omnipresent enough to offer the various protagonists opposing arguments without necessarily having to get to the root of the problem. The subject was so delicate that a peripheral strategy was needed: the Protestant subjects protested the decision made by their prince, himself Protestant, to impose the Gregorian calendar on them. We can see that the town of Minden settled on practical arguments related to the proximity of the border. However, these arguments subtly suggest that Minden had had its own history, geography, and indeed confessional identity well before it was attached to the Brandenburg.\n\n23Considering that the petition of the town of Minden was also silent on the confessional aspect of the calendar, we might consequently be tempted to index religious affiliation to the scale in question: “from above,” confessionalization would try to make a strong distinction between Protestants and Catholics; “from below,” the population would work things out more pragmatically. But interaction between the mobilized categories, various groups of actors, and the scales at which they intervene proves to resist this vertical stratification of social interplay; a third document is an invitation to see it this way.\n\nThe local lens\n\n24This time, it is a letter written by a pastor. It is in the archives of Münster and not, like the preceding two, in the archives of the central authorities in Berlin. This report to local Minden authorities, dated the 20 December 1668, relays the threats addressed to him by members of his flock on the other side of the border, while he was in the Principality of Minden and forced to apply the new calendar.\n\n27 Landesarchiv Nordrhein-Westfalen, Abteilung Westfalen : Minden-Ravensberg, Regierung, Nr. 1 521, “E (...)\n\nDoes he [the pastor] want to celebrate holidays according to the old calendar as before, or the new? They [the parishoners] cannot, they will not, and they do not have the right to celebrate according to the new time; and if he didn’t want to do it as before, and as it is custom since time immemorial, they should part with him and find themselves a new church.\n\n26Although the Principality of Minden was very small, the parishioners on the behalf of whom the pastor petitioned were not the only ones faced with two calendars in the same parish. Summarizing several complaints they had received on the subject, the government of the principality presented the problem to the Elector during the preparatory phase of the decision, on 14 March 1667:\n\n30 Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz Berlin, I. HA Rep. 32 Nr. 83 10535, “Fürstentum Mind (...)\n\n(…) insofar as certain border-zone living subjects of the Prince of Lüneburg, the Count of Lippe and of Schaumburg, among whom the old calendar is observed, belong to the churches of our principality, and in the opposite sense, subjects from here belong to churches in these territories, and insofar as they are all required to go to these churches, this results in confusion and trouble for holiday services, all the more so as, since holidays do not fall on the same day due to the time lag, the subjects would no longer celebrate any holidays, and so there should be concern, in case the bordering lords, the Brunswick-Lünenburgs and the Hesse-Kassel, cannot bring themselves to adopt the new calendar, that their subjects will wish to leave the churches of our territory, as a result of which not only the pastor but also the churches would see a significant drop in revenues in several localities.\n\n27Because it responds to the texts of princes who only speak in political and economic terms, the argument remains in the strict register of practical inconveniences, revenues and jurisdictional prerogatives of the established public confession that resists all (“they are all required to go to these churches”). It is at this local level, however, that the confessional nature of the calendar found its expression, complicating interactions between actors, scales, and categories.\n\n29“Without even recalling” – because these reasons were above all related to the rejection of a reform enacted by papal bull in 1582, and because it is not suitable for subjects to make such a discrete reminder in protest of their prince. This is indeed the particularity of confessional conflicts in the Empire after 1648: they speak of rights that were acquired, legal quibbles, contested border markings, but very rarely of the opposition of belief, which had been put aside in a way by the definition of the only legitimate arguments for confrontation, constitutive of peace: de jure and de facto arguments. It is thus unsurprising that the only person to directly express opposition of a religious order was another pastor officiating in a border area. In August 1668 he wrote a memo to the Minden government, in which he said:\n\n32 Landesarchiv Nordrhein-Westfalen, Abteilung Westfalen : Minden-Ravensberg, Regierung, Nr. 1 521, “E (...)\n\nEspecially since it is not only very difficult and painful for churches of the principality, by adopting the new calendar, to also adopt and carry into the future one of the distinctive signs of the Anti-Christ; and also to be henceforth so separated from others of their religion, near or far, that they can no longer pray on the same timing as them, nor celebrate at the same time as them the beautiful divine services of the Lord on the most holy holidays.\n\n31The religious-marker dimension of the calendar re-emerges here – under circumstances and at a scale forming a sort of reversed front when seen through the paradigm of confessionalization-from-above. This resurgence is not incompatible with everyday arrangements (as attests the attendance of neighboring markets on unworked days), which ultimately points to the same conclusion as the Elector of Brandenburg’s choice of flexibility, as the sometime champion of Protestantism against the papal calendar but also the one to introduce the same calendar in the principality of Minden. In the context of the modern Holy Roman Empire, confessional identity can only be understood through its numerous facets, its complementary scales, and the various paces taken by society’s work on itself.\n\nConclusion\n\n33On the subject of the modern Holy Roman Empire (not to mention more generally), the inertia of historiography often leads to making an absolute of a generality: Protestantism is Protestant, Catholicism is Catholic; one studies religion, economics OR politics; and boundaries (apart from a few local exceptions) are lines separating two distinct colors, like in an atlas. If, however, we take the texts produced by contemporary people seriously, in all their complexity and diversity, we are often forced to revise such categories – not with a fresh disabused perspective, but by including the impetuses behind society’s work on itself using those categories. Yes, the calendar seems to be a borderline case, precisely because it is ambiguous, but it is generally also considered to be a sort of paradigm of the confessional division. Understanding the extent to which this division is exploited differently according to scale, circumstances, actors, and texts – as the example of the principality of Minden in 1668 prompts us to do – thus makes it possible to re-introduce analysis into a situation that seemed to have been determined by confessional inertia since 1583.\n\n34The same questions are always knocked around but never completely settled: is the calendar political or religious? Is the choice of one calendar over the other determined by political obedience or confessional affiliation? Is the scale of application the whole Empire, the dynastic ensemble ruled over by a single prince, each constituent territory of this ensemble, or the local scale and its established religion?\n\n35It is precisely because these questions remain unanswered – and because they indicate how impossible it is to delimit the confessional, fragmented as it is in social practices of distinction – that we know that the boundary plays such a determinant role in conflicts over calendars, as in other domains. This is because the boundary, specifically, is where the connections between various scales, persuasions, and conceptions of primary affiliation interact. The boundary is everywhere, but this omnipresence is more than purely geographical. It is also at the heart of the definition of the conflictual coexistence of confessions, because that is where the diversity of actors, principles, modalities, and pace of this coexistence is actualized."
