        "text": "In Germany, Charles V signed “The Peace of Augsburg(1555),” which “recognized the Lutheran church” and “established the principle that all princes, whether Catholic or Lutheran, enjoyed the sole right to determine the religion of their lands and subjects.” In England, Elizabeth I issued “The 39 articles of Religion(1563)”, which “incorporated Catholic ritual along with Calvinist doctrines.” This gave Calvinists much more religious freedom in England. In France, Henry IV signed “The Edict of Nantes(1598),” which gave the Huguenots “a large measure of religious toleration.” These laws gave Protestants religious freedom which led to the spread of\n\nMartin Luther and Jean Calvin were the two of the most influential reformers during the Protestant Reformation. Luther began the Protestant Reformation by nailing his 95 Theses to the Wittenberg Chapel in 1517 in response to the corruption and abuses of the Catholic Church. In Switzerland, Calvin also had new ideas about religion, the main being predestination (the belief that people's fates (whether they go to Heaven or Hell) are predetermined when they are born). Their reforms and ideas definitely laid the foundation for capitalism, free government/democracy, religious tolerance, and individualism, but I do not believe that the reformers (people like Luther and Calvin) had the direct intention of doing these things.\n\nAlthough he absolutely opposed Martin Luther and the entire protestant reformation, his actions were crucial in the spread of the reformation. When Emperor Charles V agreed to a revival of the imperial Supreme Court and the council of regency and promised to consult with a diet of the empire on all major domestic affairs that affected the empire, he helped the development of the reformation by preventing unilateral imperial action against the Germans. Overwhelmed by all the land he controlled and the Habsburg wars he was involved in, Charles V was not able to stop Luther from reforming the church. He eventually gave up and signed the Peace of Augsburg on September 25, 1555. The Peace of Augsburg was the legalization of Catholicism and Lutheranism in the country of Germany. As a result to this peace treaty, the protestant reformation was spread throughout Germany and began to\n\nIn Victors and the Vanquished, Schwartz poses the question of “How can we evaluate conflicting sources” (ix)? Through reading historical events such as the “Conquest of New Spain” there is an undeniably large amount of destruction of cultural material and bias testimonies of events recorded several years after they occurred. After analyzing the Spanish Conquest of Mesoamerica there is a debatable amount of evidence from the Mesoamericans and Spanish explanations of this event in history. The intentions of each explanation created a conflict to historians, art historians and anthropologists on which viewpoint holds to accuracy. There is also the issue of not only inaccuracies, but the motives behind each bias account. As many of these aspects are taken into consideration, interpreting each justification between both sides of history in Mesoamerica as a clash of ethnocentrism between two different cultures that causes an uncertainty of what actually happened in history.\n\nAfter Luther was excommunicated at Worms in 1521, many princes ignored Charles V who outlawed Luther and his books.Philip of hesse formed the luteran league of Torgau, with an aim to ensure the Edict of Worms was not implemented, which was attepting to stop the spread of Lutheranism by banning books and teachings.At the Diet of Speyer in 1526 held by Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria the protestant princes for the first time professed their faith. Charles V wanted to support princes due to the threat of the Ottoman Empire but he also wanted to suppress Lutheranism. The diet concluded that the princes would have princely autonomy, which allowed the princes to adopt new religion without fear. “Each one [prince] is to rule and at as he hopes to answer to God and his Imperial majesty.” This made Lutheranism spread much easier. In 1531 the League of Schmalkalden was formed by Philip I Landgrave of Hesse and John Frederick which was a territorial political movement to break from Rome giving them economic advantages as money would go to their territories rather than to Rome. Members of this intended for this to replace the Holy Roman Empire.They would confiscate church land and expel Catholic leaders, this lasted for fifteen years without opposition, until the Schmalkaldic War from 1546-1547 which Charles V and his allies fought the league and won. But this league allowed Lutheranism to be established firmly therefore the\n\nAccording to Spain then and now, (2011), “In contrast to Spain’s startling growth of political power and prestige during the 16th century, the 17th century is commonly seen as one of decline.” Not merely historical hindsight, this view was already articulated in the early 17th century by a group of writers known as arbitristas. They lamented the deterioration of the country, and offered suggestions for both political and especially economic reform. Who recognised the stark contrast between the appearance of imperial greatness and the reality of social and economic problems in their country. Events of the 17th century confirm the foresight of the best of these early political economists. Since then there has been general consensus that Spain\n\nProsperous Political aspects of Spain’s rise was diminutive, however it brutally terminated their Golden age. Ferdinand and Isabella made Spain a strong country with many territories in Europe and the America’s. In contrast one can see the corrupt policies of Philip II and there enormous effect on Spain’s decline. Spain lost a great deal of land trying to convert people to Catholicism. In their efforts to convert and spread Christianity during the thirty years war, Spain lost complete control of the Netherlands. In addition to losing the Netherlands, the English defeat of the Spanish armada completely crushed Spain, not only\n\nAround the late 1800s, Spain was having a hard time with preventing Cuban’s from fighting for their independence. The revolts led Spain to send over General Valeriano Weyler, to put a stop to the protests. Consequently, he had anyone suspected of supporting independence, removed from the general population, and sent to concentration camps. Newspaper publishers, William R. Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, gave the word out to the American people, with the use of a little Yellow journalism--journalism based upon sensationalism and crude exaggeration, in an attempt to create disgust towards the Spanish government's actions. The American people, with their moral beliefs, and pride in their military might, decided to put into action the long-dormant\n\nIn 1520 Charles left Spain to take possession of the German Empire to which he had been elected. The French king, Francis I, had been his rival for the dignity; Leo X thought that his interests in Italy were endangered by Charles' election. The Kingdom of Navarre was already a matter of contention between France and Spain, while France and the Netherlands wrangled over the original Dukedom of Burgundy as well as Tournai, Flanders, Artois, and some lesser territories. War had not broken out over these questions, and nothing indicated that Charles would be a warlike prince; but he had broken the alliance with France made under Chièvres. The Holy See opposed the election of Charles even more vigorously than France. As King of Aragon, Charles was heir to the Kingdom of Naples, a papal fief; the\n\nDuring the 15th century, many considered Spain insignificant. However, within a century it became a world-dominant power in Europe. Although Spain only took a brief time to rise, it was also short-lived. The rise of Spain was due to its flourishing culture, stable political system and successful voyages to the New World. On the other hand, its decline was due to religious control, resistance from other countries and inflation."
