        "text": "This essay deals with rules and attitudes towards the Spanish succession crisis from 1580 to the extinction of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty in 1700. It argues that apart from succession laws, set down in the legal texts of the many different realms under Habsburg authority, attitudes and expectations created implicit rules for the succession. These attitudes and expectations have been distilled by analyzing testaments, representation of deceased relatives in the Escorial and the behaviors towards royal children. This analysis shows that Spanish royal attitudes to the succession differed considerably from codified law, and that the behavior and policies of the kings of Spain were mainly guided by the former. This essay demonstrates, therefore, that in order to understand the development of the Spanish succession crisis, the traditional focus on biology, politics and laws needs to be expanded to include the dynasty’s implicit rules of succession.\n\nHabsburg intellectuals claimed that Charles V (1500–1558) was chosen by God to coordinate the defence of Christendom against the Ottoman Empire and to take care of the spiritual wellbeing of all Christians by fighting heresy. The Genoese captain Antonio Doria (c.1495–1577) was among the writers describing Charles as a pious and benevolent universal monarch and endorsing his military and political project. In the work entitled ‘Compendio’ (1571), Doria gives an account of the events taking place in the world during Charles's reign. This document is significant not only because Doria (with his more famous cousin Andrea) took part in several of the military episodes here recounted, but also because Genoa had joined the empire without losing its independence. Therefore, Antonio Doria's ‘Compendio’ represents an important source if we want to understand the reception of (and contribution to) sixteenth‐century imperial propaganda in the Italian context. After briefly presenting Doria's career and Genoa's republican culture, this article shows the global perspective of the text and argues that we can find in it an endorsement of Habsburg governance and an attempt to (re)order recent events within a universal, supranational framework. The final section briefly compares the ‘Compendio’ with two contemporary histories."
