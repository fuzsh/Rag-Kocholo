        "text": "Martin Luther born in Eisleben, Germany, son of Han Luder/Luther and Margarethe Lindemann Luder/Luther. He was baptized the next day, St. Martin’s Day and thus given the name Martin.\n\nMartin Luther translates the New Testament into German from the original Greek and Hebrew while hiding out in a castle tower provided by Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony.\n\n1524 -1525 – woodcut of The Peasant’s Revolt shows common farmers taking up farm implements to fight their battles by Johannes Stumpf in 1548 in Chronik\n\nPeasant’s Revolt in Germany went too far in getting rid of normal church activities and structures. Churches were burned, monastaries were burned and statues and stained glass were destroyed. Many of the medieval monastaries, abbeys and convents were closed permanently. Luther did not approve of these iconoclasts, as he simply wanted to reform the Church, not destroy it.\n\nDiet of Speyer – Holy Roman Empire censors books it doesn’t want published in an effort to stop the spread of the ideas of Luther and other reformers, and retain control of the churches.\n\nMartin Luther writes the hymn “A Mighty Fortress”, a powerful hymn about God as our protector, which was written simply enough for the congregation to join in the singing. It is Martin Luther’s most famous hymn.\n\nUlrich Zwingli, a comtemporary of Luther dies in Battle of Kappel in Switzerland and is replaced by John Calvin as leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. Zwingli and Calvin unfortunately, did not believe Christ is truly present in the Holy Eucharist\n\nMartin Luther published his translation of the Holy Bible into German, and it soon became the most influential German translation, helping to codify the German language.\n\nWilliam Tynsdale burned at the stake in England for translating the Holy Bible into English against the wishes of King Henry the VIII."
