        "text": "Tuition does not include the cost of lab fees, textbooks, or other required materials for specific courses. In general, full-time graduate and undergraduate students should anticipate costs for textbooks and course supplies of $1,300–$2,200 for the academic year. Textbook costs for specific courses can be found on the website of the Boston College Bookstore.\n\nStudents taking zero credit courses are still subject to mandatory fees.\n\nUndergraduate students attempting to accelerate their graduation to graduate in fewer than eight full academic year semesters are subject to additional charges. For more information, view the Graduation, Advanced Standing, and Acceleration section of the Undergraduate Academic Regulations on the University Catalog: Policies and Procedures page.\n\nThe University reserves the right to correct typographical errors or to adjust the Tuition and Fees schedule at any time it deems necessary.\n\nThe Trustees of Boston College reserve the right to change the tuition rates and to make additional charges within the University whenever such action is deemed necessary.\n\nCollection Cost and Fees\n\nMatriculated students at Boston College are individually, personally, and primarily responsible to the University for paying all tuition and other fees associated with enrollment and housing and food. This obligation also applies to any additional tuition and fees resulting from adjustments to course schedules. Students remain responsible in accordance with University policy for tuition and fees for classes for which they register, including any classes for which they have been withdrawn, been dropped, failed, or failed to attend. Students must formally withdraw from any/all classes that they do not attend in a particular semester. Students will not be relieved of their responsibility to pay tuition unless they withdraw from classes in accordance with the withdrawal timelines and procedures published by the Office of Student Services in the University Catalog.\n\nAll billing statements are sent electronically. Information on how to access student bills and related account information is available on the Office of Student Services website, including at www.bc.edu/mybill. Students are responsible for reviewing their billing statements, making payments by the due date stated in the billing statement, and notifying the University’s Office of Student Services in a timely manner of any errors or discrepancies. A student may authorize parents, guardians or others to view their statements and pay on their behalf, but each student shall remain individually, personally and primarily responsible for the payment of all amounts charged to their accounts. There may be a $150 late payment fee assessed to unresolved accounts by the due date. Students will also be charged a fee of $25.00 for a returned check or returned electronic payment ($65 for any returned item over $2,000).\n\nIn the event a student’s account becomes delinquent or fails to comply with a payment plan approved by Boston College, then Boston College may withdraw the student, place holds on the student’s transcript and diploma, and deny access to University services, including registration, dining, residence hall selection, library, travel abroad and recreation services.\n\nIn the event a student’s account becomes delinquent or if the student fails to comply with a payment plan approved by Boston College to bring the delinquent account current, Boston College may refer the student’s delinquent account to a collection agency, attorney or other third party that provides collection-related services. In addition to the student’s responsibility for paying any amounts due on the account prior to referral for collection-related services, the student shall be responsible for (a) paying any and all collection-related fees, which may be based on a percentage of a student’s delinquent account balance, provided that such percentage does not exceed 40%, and (b) paying any and all costs incurred in connection with the efforts to collect on the student’s delinquent account, including without limitation court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. The University, or its agents, may also report a student’s account delinquency to one or more of the national credit bureaus.\n\nNotice of Consent to Collection Communications\n\nBy registering for a course at Boston College, a student authorizes Boston College and its agents and contractors to contact the student at any current or future phone number(s), email address(es) and wireless device(s) regarding the student’s account and/or any payments owed to Boston College. Students also authorize Boston College and its agents and contractors to use automated telephone dialing equipment, artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages, and personal calls and emails, in their efforts to contact me. Students also consent to Boston College, or its affiliates, agents, and service providers, to recording telephone calls regarding the student’s account in assurance of quality and/or other reasons."
