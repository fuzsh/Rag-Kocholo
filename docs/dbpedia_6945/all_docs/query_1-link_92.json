        "text": "End of First Century BC A large settlement of the Celtic Catuvellauni developed and was known as Verlamion.\n\nAD50 The Roman City of Verulamium founded.\n\nAD60 Verulamium destroyed by Queen Boudicca (Boadicea).\n\nThird Century (circa AD250) Alban a citizen of Verulamium martyred for his Christian faith.\n\nc. 450 By this date the Roman City had almost ceased to exist.\n\n793 St Albans Abbey “founded” by King Offa of Mercia. Eventually the town of St Albans grew up around the Abbey.\n\n948 St Albans School is founded by Abbot Ulsinus (Wulsin).\n\n1086 At the time of Domesday Book about 500 people lived in the town.\n\n1140 Sopwell Nunnery is founded by Abbot Geoffrey de Gorham.\n\n1213 Council held at the Abbey at which Barons and Churchmen first discussed their grievances – this was the first step towards the Magna Carta of 1215.\n\n1217 After Magna Carta was ignored by the King, the barons invited French help to depose John. The Dauphin of France occupied the town in 1217. A month later, an army led by the notorious Faulkes de Breaute sacked St Albans, leading to the Dauphin returning to despoil the town.\n\n1349 The Black Death caused many deaths in the town and Abbey.\n\n1381 The Peasants Revolt gave the townsmen an opportunity to press their claims again. The abbots warrens and woods were broken into, four houses destroyed and the Abbot’s prison broken open. In the retribution that followed, 17 men were hanged and many of the leading townsmen imprisoned. John Ball, one of the national leaders of the rebels, was brought from Coventry and tried in front of the King, in the Moot Hall. He was condemned to drawing, hanging, beheading, disembowelling and quartering!\n\n1455 The First Battle of St Albans opened the War of the Roses. The Lancastrian army led by King Henry VI occupied the town but the Yorkist forces of the Earl of Warwick managed to break in and a battle took place in the town centre. King Henry was wounded by an arrow and captured.\n\n1461 The Second Battle of St Albans led to victory for the Lancastrians under Queen Margaret, who brought her forces down Watling Street from Dunstable. Much of the fighting took place on Bernards Heath on the north of the town and the Yorkists in retreat left the King (who had been released from his first captivity at St Albans and then retaken) sitting under an oak tree on Nomansland common.\n\n1539 The Abbey was dissolved on Dec. 5th by King Henry VIII.\n\n1553 King Edward VI granted a charter to the town by which it became a Borough with a Mayor and Corporation. The King sold the Abbey Church to the town for £400.\n\n1555 George Tankerfield, a protestant Yorkshire baker was brought from London and burnt to death on Romeland – as an example to others.\n\n1642 During the English Civil War the town sided with Parliament but was largely unaffected by the conflict.\n\n1643 The High Sheriff of Hertfordshire was arrested by Captain Oliver Cromwell after he had unwisely read a Royal Proclamation, from the steps of the Eleanor Cross. Later that year the town was the headquarters of the Earl of Essex’s Parliamentary Army.\n\n1645 The New Model Army was reviewed by Fairfax at St Albans.\n\n1648 An Army Council was held in the Abbey Church which effectively sealed the fate of King Charles I.\n\n1852 The town was deprived of representation in Parliament because of bribery and corruption at elections.\n\n1877 The Abbey Church was granted Cathedral status and the town a City charter.\n\n1881 The city’s original football club, St Albans FC was founded. This became defunct in 1904. The current club, St Albans City FC was founded in April 1908.\n\n1916 In September, following an attack on St Albans, the German airship SL 11 became the first airship to be brought down over England.\n\n1972 The first meeting of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) was held in St Albans on 20 November 1972, at the Farriers Arms pub which has a blue plaque commemorating the event. The organisation still has its head office in Hatfield Road. The local branch holds an annual beer festival in St Albans.\n\n1974 St Albans City Council, St Albans Rural District Council and Harpenden Town Council are merged to form St Albans District Council as part of a much wider local government reorganisation.\n\n2001 Census returns show a population of 129,000 for St Albans City and District.\n\nThe town is first recorded as Verlamion, a Celtic British Iron Age settlement whose name means ‘the settlement above the marsh’. After the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43, it developed as Verulamium and became one of the largest towns in Roman Britain but was later destroyed during the revolt of Boudicca in AD 60-61 before being rebuilt.\n\nOne of the most significant events in the town’s history and its namesake was the execution of Alban in around AD 250. Alban was a pagan living in Verulamium who was converted to Christianity when he sheltered a Christian priest. The legend goes that Alban switched cloaks with the priest and was arrested in his stead by Roman soldiers and subsequently executed for his faith. Alban’s declaration “I worship and adore the true and living God who created all things” is still used in prayer at St Albans Cathedral. He was later made a saint and named as the first Christian martyr. A shrine was built on the site of his death following Emperor Constantine’s adoption of Christianity as the religion of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Roman City of Verulamium slowly declined and fell into decay after the departure of the Roman Army in AD 410. However, the ruined buildings provided materials to build the new Norman Abbey and the Roman bricks removed from Verulamium are still evident in the Cathedral today.\n\nMuch of the Roman town was uncovered in the 1930’s including a hypocaust, mosaic flooring and remaining walls. These are on view in Verulamium Park today. Many of the artefacts are housed in the Verulamium Museum, also in the park. There is also the nearby open air privately owned Roman theatre. Also in the park is reputedly one of oldest pubs in England, Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, having one of the longest running continuous licences.\n\nAfter the Reformation, the Abbey was dissolved in 1539 and sold to the town in 1553 for £400, becoming a Protestant parish church. A market had been running outside the abbey since the 10th century and was confirmed by King John in 1202. It was not until May 1553 that, in response to a public petition, the town received a Royal Charter by King Edward VI. The Charter granted St Albans the status of borough as well as defining the powers of mayors and councillors. It was also in the charter that the market days of Wednesday and Saturday were specified, which continue to this day.\n\nIn the late 17th or early 18th century, reputedly in around 1736, Sarah Churchill, the 1st Duchess of Marlborough built and endowed the almshouses on Hatfield Road, which are currently still standing. These were used for the comfortable support and maintenance of 36 poor persons – 18 poor men, and 18 poor women. The Duchess, who was a favourite of Queen Anne, had land in St Albans via her marriage with John Churchill, who lived in Sandridge. The Marlboroughs retired to Blenheim Palace, which Sarah completed building after her husband’s death in 1722.\n\nThe growth of the town was facilitated by the market as well as the proximity to London. Verulam Road was created specifically to aid the movement of stage coaches, as St Albans was conveniently placed as a first night’s stop on the journey from London. This is why there are a large number of pubs in the city, reportedly the most per square mile in Britain, as they were previously used as coaching inns. The coaching industry declined after the 1840’s, when the railway arrived in 1858. There were originally three lines into the city, firstly the route to Watford, then a now defunct line to Hatfield in 1865 and finally the mainline service to London and Bedford in 1868.\n\nIt was these transport links that attracted a local seed merchant, Samuel Ryder, to locate his business to St Albans, eventually moving to offices and a large packing workshop on Holywell Hill, located where the Comfort Hotel and Café Rouge stand today. He served as Mayor of St Albans and remained a councillor for several years after his term. In his later life, Ryder began to suffer from poor health and was advised to take up golf as exercise. He joined the local Verulam Golf Club, making large donations to the club including the famous Ryder Cup and sponsorship of the tournament."
