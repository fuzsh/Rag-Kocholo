        "text": "About April 1546 - Two months after Luther's death, a heartbroken Katharina wrote her sister that everyone with any sort of heart must be mourning her dead husband. She could not eat or sleep, and she was so disoriented that she was unable to write or dictate her letter in an orderly manner. To her Martin Luther was \"this dear and precious man.\"\n\nEmperor Charles Strikes a Non-Fatal Blow\n\nNovember 1546 - The Schmalkaldic War broke out between the forces of Emperor Charles V and the Lutheran Schmalkaldic League. With the troops of Emperor Charles advancing, Wittenberg University was temporarily dissolved. Philipp Melanchthon and his family fled 32 miles west to the city of Zerbst in Anhalt and Katharina Luther and her children followed him. Katharina returned to Wittenberg a few weeks later. Again she turned her home into a hostel, taking in both professors and students to provide an income. With the help of Melanchthon, who was appointed as her guardian, she attempted to win back her confiscated property and rights. She petitioned Christian II, the King of Denmark, to continue sending the annual payments of fifty Gulden received by her husband, to which he agreed.\n\nApril of 1547 - Katharina again fled Wittenberg, this time to Braunschweig, intending to go to Copenhagen to seek asylum with the king of Denmark. But the wagon with her and the children had to turn back north of Lüneburg, about 184 miles northwest of Wittenberg. ​​\n\n​​​April 24, 1547 - At the Battle of Mühlberg in Saxony, the Catholic princes led by Emperor Charles V and the Duke of Alba decisively defeated the Schmalkaldic League of Protestant princes under the command of Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse. Over 7,000 men died or were wounded and 1,000 were taken prisoner.\n\nMühlberg, Germany\n\nMay 19, 1547 – So as not to lose time by laying siege to Wittenberg, Emperor Charles chose to negotiate with Elector John Frederick. To save his wife and sons, and to prevent Wittenberg from being destroyed, John signed the Capitulation of Wittenberg, and resigned his title in favor of his cousin Maurice. Two days later Charles V entered Wittenberg. A rumor spread that while he stood in front of Luther's tomb in the Castle Church he was urged to have Luther's body dug up burned and his ashes scattered. Reportedly Charles replied, \"I don't make war against dead men.\"\n\n​\n\nLate fall, 1547 - At the close of the war Katharina was able to return to Wittenberg, only to find the buildings and lands of the Black Cloister torn apart and laid waste. Her farm animals had been stolen or killed. The two flights exhausted the family's cash reserves, but with hard work Katharina got back on her feet. She obtained scholarships for her sons from the Dukes of Prussia and Württemberg.\n\nMay 15, 1548 - After defeating the Protestant Schmalkaldic League Emperor Charles V established a provisional ruling on the religious strife between Lutherans and Catholics known as the Augsburg Interim. It ordered Protestants to readopt traditional Catholic beliefs and practices, including the seven Sacraments, transubstantiation and the authority of the pope . But, it allowed for Protestant clergymen the right to marry and for the laity to receive both bread and wine at communion.. It is considered the first significant step in the process leading to the political and religious legitimization of Protestantism.\n\nDespite the fact that Philip Melanchthon was willing to compromise for the sake of peace, the Augsburg Interim was rejected by a significant number of Lutheran pastors and theologians. Many Catholic princes did not accept the Interim because of their concern for rising imperial authority. The pope refused to recognize the Interim for over a year as he saw it as an infringement of his jurisdiction. Charles V tried to enforce the Interim in the Holy Roman Empire, but was only successful in territories under his military control.\n\nOctober 1551 – Due to increased debts Katharina took out a mortgage on her farm in Zulsdorf, near Leipzig.\n\nJanuary 1552 - Elector Maurice of Saxony, known as the \"Judas of the Reformation\" for changing sides at Mühlburg, switched sides again. Under his leadership, he and his fellow German princes formed an alliance with Henry II of France and chased Charles V out of Germany and back to his ancestral home in Austria.\n\nAugust 2, 1552 - Weary from three decades of religious civil war, Charles V agreed to the Peace of Passau guaranteeing Lutheran religious freedoms. The Protestant princes taken prisoner during the Schmalkaldic War were released. The Peace effectively ended Charles V's lifelong quest to reunify the Catholic Church.\n\nSummer 1552 – An outbreak of the Black Plague forced Wittenberg University to move to Torgau. Katie Luther was determined to stay in the Black Cloister as long as possible. Finally, in September, the plague came to her house. Hans was at school in Königsberg and Martin may have been studying in Wittenberg. Katie boarded a carriage with Paul and Margaretha and headed for Torgau. Along the way, something startled the horses and they shied. Katie attempted to jump from the carriage to settle the horses and protect her children. Jumping from the carriage she fell, ending up in a ditch full of freezing water.\n\nPaul and Margaretha managed to get their mother to Torgau. But the fall and her injuries, along with shock from the cold water lead to paralysis. Katie was bedridden for three months, attended by Margaretha, Paul brought her happy news when he announced his marriage to Anna von Warbeck.\n\nIn her last days, Katie frequently entrusted her children to God’s care and the faith her husband had fought so hard for. Finally, the injuries and accompanying illness became too much and she died, one month shy of her 54th birthday..\n\n​Legend claims that as she lay dying, she was asked about her faith. She replied that she would “cling to Christ as a burr to a dress”. Katie was buried in Torgau's Saint Mary's Church, 47 miles from her husband's tomb in Wittenberg.\n\nLeft: House in Torgau where Katharina von Bora Luther died. Above: Parlor in the Katharina Luther death house.\n\nSt. Mary's Church in Torgau, where Kathatina von Bora Luther was buried.\n\nTomb of Katharina Luther in Torgau's St. Mary's Church. Translated, the inscription reads: \"ANNO 1552, the 20th DECEMBER. The blessed widow Katharina left behind by Martin Luther passed away peacefully here in Torgau.\"\n\nAfter the death of Katharina, the Black Cloister in Wittenberg was sold back to the university.\n\nAt the time of Katie's death her surviving children were adults.\n\nHans studied law and became a court adviser.\n\nMartin studied theology, but never had a regular pastoral call.\n\nPaul became a physician and fathered six children. The male line of the Luther family continued through him to Johann Ernest Luther, a grandson of the great reformer, who was married at St. Michael's Church in Zeitz, Germany. He and his wife Martha had eight children and established the Zeitz line of the Luther family. His headstone is embedded in the wall of the cloister at the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul. There are still descendants of Martin Luther living in Zeitz today.\n\nMargareta married Georg von Kunheim, a member of a wealthy, noble Prussian family. She died at age 36, but her line continued into the 20th century. It includes German President Paul von Hindenburg (1847–1934).\n\nThe descendants of Martin Luther are called “Lutherides”. They consist of descendants of Martin Luther and Katharina von Bora, as well as of the collateral relatives, The association has around 350 members all over the world. It was founded in 1926 in Eisenach. There are probably several thousand descendants of Luther and there exist branches in the USA and in the Netherlands, where a descendant of the Reformer from Schulpforta emigrated to in 1735. Most of them, including the line in the Netherlands, descend from Martin Luther's youngest son Paul (1533-1593), who was a doctor and the personal physician of Duke John Frederick II from Saxony. However, the Luther family name died out November 3, 1759 when great-great-grandson Martin Gottlob Luther, an attorney in Dresden passed away.\n\nJanuary 1552 - Princes' War: Led by Elector Maurice of Saxony, many Protestant princes formed an alliance with Henry II of France at the Treaty of Chambord. In return for French funding and assistance, Henry was promised lands in western Germany. Emperor Charles V was driven out of Germany to his ancestral lands in Austria, Elector Maurice returned to Saxony. No longer seen as a traitor, both Protestants and Catholics rendered him equal respect. The emperor exhorted both parties to maintain peace in his empire.\n\nJuly 9, 1553 - At the Battle of Sievershausen in Germany, Elector Maurice defeated his former ally Albert, But he was badly wounded in the stomach and died in a field camp at the age of 32.\n\nSeptember 25, 1555 - Peace of Augsburg was the first permanent legal basis for the coexistence of Lutheranism and Catholicism in Germany, by the Diet of Augsburg. The Peace allowed the princes to select either Lutheranism or Catholicism as the religion of their domain and permitted those who adhered to the other church could sell their property and migrate to a territory where that denomination was recognized. The legislation officially ended conflict between Catholics and Lutherans, though it made no provisions for other Protestant denominations,\n\nDecember 4, 1563 - Final session of the Council of Trent which took place between 1545 and 1563 in Trento (Trent) and Bologna, northern Italy. It was one of the Roman Catholic Church's most important councils. Prompted by the Protestant Reformation, it has been described as the embodiment of the Counter-Reformation. ​ Charles V had wanted abuses looked at first in an attempt to please the Protestants and hopefully tempt them back to the church. Once they were back they could look at doctrine. Paul III did not want this as reforms could financially damage him and concessions could diminish his authority.\n\nNicene Creed accepted as the basis of Catholic faith.\n\nCanon of Old and New Testament books was fixed;\n\nTradition was accepted as a source of faith.\n\nLatin Vulgate was declared adequate for doctrinal proofs.\n\nThe nature and consequences of original sin were defined.\n\nBishops must reside in their respective territories, The church effectively abolished plurality of bishoprics.\n\nChrist is entirely present in both the consecrated bread and the consecrated wine in the Eucharist but left to the pope the practical decision of whether or not the chalice should be granted to the laity.\n\nThe mass was a true sacrifice.\n\nThe Council denied the Lutheran idea of justification by faith. They affirmed the Doctrine of Merit, which allows human beings to redeem themselves through Good Works, and through the sacraments.\n\nThey affirmed the existence of Purgatory and the usefulness of prayer and indulgences in shortening a person's stay in purgatory.\n\nThey reaffirmed the belief in transubstantiation and the importance of all seven sacraments.\n\nThey reaffirmed the authority of scripture and the teachings and traditions of the Church.\n\nThey reaffirmed the necessity and correctness of religious art and he usefulness of images, but indicated that church officials should be careful to promote the correct use of images and guard against the possibility of idolatry.\n\nBy the end of the century, many of the abuses that motivated the Protestant Reformation disappeared, and the Roman Catholic Church reclaimed many of its followers in Europe. The council, however, failed to heal the schism that divided the Western Christian church.\n\n1618–1648 - The Thirty Years War was in reality a series of wars fought by various nations for various reasons, including religious, dynastic, territorial, and commercial rivalries. Its destructive campaigns and battles occurred over most of Europe\n\nAlthough the struggles that created it erupted some years earlier, the war is held to have begun in 1618, when the future Holy Roman emperor Ferdinand II attempted to impose Roman Catholicism on his domains, and the Protestant nobles of Bohemia and Austria rose up in rebellion. After a five-year struggle Ferdinand won. In 1625 King Christian IV of Denmark saw an opportunity to gain valuable territory in Germany to balance his loss of Baltic provinces to Sweden. Christian’s defeat finished Denmark as a European power, but Sweden’s Gustav II Adolf invaded Germany and won many German princes to his anti-Roman Catholic cause.\n\nMeanwhile the conflict widened, fueled by political ambitions of the various powers. Poland pushed its own ambitions by attacking Russia and establishing a dictatorship in Moscow. The Peace of Polyanov in 1634 ended Poland’s claim to the Russian throne but freed Poland to resume hostilities against its archenemy, Sweden, which was deeply embroiled in Germany. Here, in the heartland of Europe Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism vied for dominance.\n\nThe principal battlefield for all these conflicts was the towns and principalities of Germany, which suffered severely. During the war, many of the contending armies were mercenaries, many of whom could not collect their pay. Thus began the “wolf-strategy” that typified this war. The armies plundered as they marched, leaving cities, towns, villages and farms ravaged.\n\nWhen the contending powers finally met in the German province of Westphalia to end the bloodshed, the balance of power in Europe had been radically changed. Spain had lost not only the Netherlands but its dominant position in western Europe. France was now the chief Western power. Sweden had control of the Baltic. The United Netherlands was recognized as an independent republic. The member states of the Holy Roman Empire were granted full sovereignty. The long-standing notion of a Roman Catholic Europe, headed spiritually by a pope and temporally by an emperor, was permanently ended, and the essential structure of modern Europe as a community of sovereign states was established. When the war ended the map of Europe had been irrevocably changed.\n\nMay and October 1648 - Peace of Westphalia, a series of treaties, ended the Thirty Years' War\n\nIt's two main tenets were:\n\nAll parties would now recognize the Peace of Augsburg of 1555, by which each prince had the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism.\n\nThose Christians living in principalities where their denomination was not the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in privacy.\n\nThe treaty also effectively ended the Papacy's political power. Pope Innocent X declared the treaty \"null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane...\"\n\nRoman Catholics and Protestants alike, ignored him...\n\n​If a pebble dropped in a pool of water sends out ripples, then the Reformation was like a fiery meteor slamming into a body of water, sending out waves of titanic proportions. In their aftermath those waves have shaped the lives of people and nations. They redirected economic, political, and social pathways. They created inroads where there were none, and washed over those who tried to stop it. Its waves continue to surge today.\n\nTimeline\n\n1547 --\n\nApril 24 - Smalcaldic League defeated by Charles V at Battle of Mühlberg,\n\nJohn Frederick the Magnanimous taken captive in battle and exiled to Weimar\n\nWittenberg surrendered to save itself and the lives of John Frederick’s wife and sons\n\nLuther’s Small Catechism is first book printed in Lithuania\n\n1548 --\n\nMay 15 - Augsburg Interim published,\n\nJohn Frederick the Magnanimous founds Jena College\n\nAdiaphoristic controversy begins\n\nLeipzig Interim presented by Maurice, December\n\n1549 --\n\nFrancis Xavier introduces Christianity in Japan\n\nNovember 9 - Matthias Flacius moves to Magdeburg\n\n1550 --\n\nCalvin writes the ConsensusTigurinus to merge Zwingli and Calvinist views of the Lord’s Supper\n\nCharles V commands the death penalty for all heresy in the Holy Roman Empire\n\n1551 --\n\nCouncil of Trent holds more sessions, 1551–52\n\n1552 --\n\nAugust 2 - Maurice turns against Charles V, April 5, who then is forced to grant limited legal rights to Lutherans in signing the peace treaty of Passau,\n\nJohn Frederick the Magnanimous released from captivity (September 1), moves electoral capital to Weimar\n\nDecember 20 - Katharina von Bora dies in Torgau,\n\nJoachim Westphal publishes treatise fully exposing Calvinist error on Lord’s Supper\n\n1553 --\n\nJuly 9 - Elector Maurice of Saxony is killed at the Battle of Sievershausen trying to enforce the peace treaty of Passau,\n\nAugustus I becomes Elector of Saxony\n\nOctober 16 - Lucas Cranach the Elder dies in Weimar,\n\nMary Tudor begins her reign, attempts to return England to Catholicism\n\n1554 --\n\nJohn Frederick the Magnanimous dies, March 3\n\n1555 --\n\nPeace of Augsburg allows Lutherans equal rights in Holy Roman Empire\n\nOctober 5 - Justas Jonas dies in Eisfeld\n\nPope Paul IV begins pontificate, makes stamping out Protestantism high priority\n\nPfeffinger publishes treatise on human cooperation in salvation, occasions Synergist controversy\n\n1556 --\n\nCharles V abdicates throne, retires to monastery in Spain\n\n1557 --\n\nFebruary 15 - Gregory Brück dies at Jena\n\nColloquy of Worms (to unite Lutherans and Catholics) fails\n\n1558 --\n\nElizabeth I becomes queen of England, restores Reformation via Calvinism\n\nCollege of Jena becomes the University of Jena;

Although a Protestant, he aided the Roman Catholic emperor Charles V against the forces of Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1545, Maurice refused to join the Protestant Schmalkaldic League, although Landgrave Philip of Hesse, his father-in-law, was its leader. Maurice returned to Charles’s camp and conquered electoral Saxony. Ousted in 1547, he returned after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in the Battle of Mühlberg (1547) and received the electoral dignity and sizable lands.\n\nSoon Maurice began to resent Charles’ plans to reintroduce Catholicism in Germany’s Protestant territories and the continued imprisonment of his father-in-law, Philip the landgrave of Hesse, whose freedom Charles had guaranteed. Commissioned to capture the rebellious Lutheran city of Magdeburg, Maurice seized the occasion to raise an army. In March 1552 he overran southern Germany and parts of Austria, forcing the Emperor to flee and release Philip. In August 1552 the Lutheran position was provisionally guaranteed by the Treaty of Passau. Again returning to the Emperor’s camp, Maurice campaigned against the Turks in Hungary.\n\n​Finally, in northwestern Germany, he confronted his former ally Albert II of Brandenburg, who had rejected the Peace of Passau. He defeated Albert at Sievershausen but died of wounds sustained in the battle.\n\n​Did you know?\n\nToday, approximately 1 out every 4 Christians in the world are Protestant, and 1 out of every 5 Protestants in the world are Lutheran. Thus, approximately 1 out of every 20 Christians in the world are Lutheran.\n\n​Reflections\n\nWhat would you do if you found out that you had a short time to live? Would you, like Luther, plant a tree or would you do something else?\n\nThink of a time you felt God was very close.\n\nThink of a time you felt God was far away.\n\nIf one of your best friends were to identify your greatest gifts, what would they be?\n\nName two.\n\nHow can you use your gifts for ministry in your daily life?\n\nWhat is your favorite hymn and why?\n\nIn the past, issues such as slavery, the holocaust, and apartheid were encouraged by selective readings of Scripture. Can you think of ways God's word is misused today?\n\nHow can we combat such misuse?"
