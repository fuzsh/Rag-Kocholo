        "text": "The success of the treaties of Westphalia in preserving the religious peace in the Holy Roman Empire after 1648 has been a popular scholarly theme. Many historians also realize, however, that confessional tensions and confrontations persisted well into the eighteenth century. Exploring an early eighteenth-century German confessional crisis centered in the Palatinate, this article focuses on the degree to which judicial, political, and diplomatic mechanisms successfully regulated and deescalated confessional strife. In short, it looks at the “juridification” of confessional conflict in the Empire. In so doing, it addresses a number of underresearched themes, such as the reactions of the Catholic princes and the Emperor, the internal dynamics within the Corpus Evangelicorum, as well as the international dimension of European great power politics. This not only provides a multiangle analysis of a crisis that saw the emergence of a new regime in the politics of religion, but also offers greater insight into the relationship between the powerful, militarized Protestant territorial-states of northern Germany and the Habsburg emperorship, specifically with regard to the judicial authority of the latter.\n\n65 A further reason why the Protestant party asserted itself more vociferously in 1719 than it had during the earlier dispute was that the latter occurred during the War of the Spanish Succession, which might possibly have served to inhibit activity that might have appeared to be disloyal during an Imperial war against France.

[likely 1719], in William Coxe, Memoirs of the life and administration of Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, vol. 1 (London, 1816), 321–23; J.F. Chance, George I and the Northern War.

The Catholic side rejected the CE's conception of the religious corpora as firmly established Imperial institutions, and therefore pursued a policy of “invisibilization,” i.e., operating largely in secret in order to challenge implicitly the CE's legitimacy, while nevertheless secretly coordinating common strategies; see Brachwitz, Autorität, 60–96. The Mainz archival material from this period only partially confirms this view, for the Catholic side only undertook the most tentative steps toward a common approach."
