        "text": "Compiled by Dennis W. Wilhelm, Chairman Barbara Baer Capitman Archives of MDPL\n\nAugust 1976\n\nThe Miami Design Preservation League (MDPL) was formed through the efforts of Barbara Baer Capitman and her son John Capitman. The initial impetus was to find a project to honor the United States’ bicentennial; the Capitmans worked with designers Leonard Horowitz and Lillian Barber to identify a concentration of 1930s buildings in South Miami Beach that the group felt could be a historic district of 20th century architecture.\n\nDecember 1976\n\nMDPL held its first large-scale public meeting, dubbed the “Design Forum.”\n\nMay 6, 1977\n\nMDPL was incorporated by the State of Florida. Officers were: Barbara Baer Captiman, President; David Gell, Secretary; Jerry Peters, Treasurer; and Howard M. Neu, Vice President.\n\nSeptember 1977\n\nArt Deco Number of Night and Day magazine highlights the goals and accomplishments of MDPL.\n\nOctober 13-19, 1978\n\nArt Deco Week organized by MDPL. The festival was held at and around the Cardozo Hotel on Ocean Drive. Barbara Capitman created the event as a showcase for the Art Deco section of Miami Beach hoping to attract both locals and tourists to the area which was comprised of an elderly population living on fixed income, many living at the poverty level. The next year the festival became an annual and was renamed Art Deco Weekend ®.\n\nDecember 12, 1978\n\nBy-laws of MDPL were amended and submitted to State of Florida. Barbara Baer Capitman, David J. Gell and Carl Weinhardt, Jr. were authorized to execute the Articles as subscribers and Andres Fabergas and Michael Kinerk, president and secretary, respectively, were authorized to execute the declaration. Chairperson, Barbara Baer Capitman; President, Andres Fabregas; Vice President, Leonard Horowitz; Secretary, Michael D. Kinerk; Treasurer, Jose Madrazo; Board members besides officers: Jerald Goodman, Claire Major, Joy Moos, Karolyn Robinson, Sol Schreiber, Landon Thorne III, Carl J Weinhardt, Jr., Mitchell Wolfson, Jr.\n\nMay 14, 1979\n\nThe Miami Beach Architectural Historic District (popularly known as the “Art Deco District” and “Old Miami Beach”) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was the nation’s first urban 20th century Historic District.\n\nJuly 1979\n\nPortfolio of the Art Deco Historic District was published by MDPL with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA.) Barbara Capitman, editor; Diane Camber, Assistant Editor; Bill Bucolo, Managing Editor; photographic essay by David Kaminsky; articles by Carl J. Weinhardt, Jr., Karalyn Robinson, Barbara Capitman and Andrew Capitman.\n\nSeptember 1979\n\nThe Art Deco District: Time Present Time Past, a magazine with articles on various aspects of Art Deco, was published by MDPL.\n\nMarch, 1980\n\nAndy Warhol, world-famous artist and one of the pioneering Art Deco collectors, called the MDPL office in March 1980 and asked if someone would show him the Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach. An appointment was made, Warhol arrived from New York and he was given a top to bottom tour led by MDPL founder, Barbara Baer Capitman and Diana Camber the Executive Director of MDPL, now Director of the Bass Museum of Art. This event was widely covered by the news media and gave our new historic district a stamp of approval from an art-world celebrity.\n\nApril 1980\n\nThe Boulevard Hotel, at 775 Dade Boulevard, was demolished.\n\nJanuary 1981\n\nThe Anderson-Notter-Finegold plan for the Miami Beach Architectural Historic District was completed (the plan was never adopted).\n\nJanuary 7, 1981\n\nThe New Yorker Hotel (Henry Hohauser, 1939), at 1611 Collins Avenue, was demolished. Despite sustained protests from preservationists, the hotel was destroyed by owners Abe Resnik, Dov Dunaesvsky, and Isaac Fryd. The hotel, which many consider to be Hohauser’s most successful design, awakened the community to the need to enact local legislation to protect properties listed on the National Register. The hotel’s façade was later used in the new logo of the Miami Design Preservation League; the New Yorker’s lot stood vacant for many years and is now occupied by the northern-most portion of the Loew’s convention center hotel.\n\nFebruary 1981\n\nAdoption of the first Dade County Historic Preservation Ordinance, which required municipalities to adopt Historic Preservation Ordinances by July 1982.\n\nFebruary 4, 1981\n\nCity Commission adopted Resolution No. 81-16551 requesting exemption from County Historic Preservation ordinances.\n\n1981\n\nMDPL founders Barbara Baer Capitman and Leonard Horowitz took a cross-country trip to “discover” Art Deco architecture in major U.S. cities. The trip spurred the development of Art Deco societies in many of the cities, and Capitman began to be referred to as the “Johnny Appleseed of Art Deco.”\n\n1981-1982\n\nMDPL worked to protect historic buildings by encouraging local historic designation on the National Register District.\n\nApril 2, 1982\n\nFirst meeting of Mayor’s Ad Hoc Committee to draft and review a Historic Preservation Ordinance for Miami Beach.\n\nJune, 1982\n\nMiami Beach Art Deco District: Time Future was published by Community Action and Research under the auspices of MDPL. The booklet, edited by Paul A. Rothman and Barbara Capitman with graphic design by Woody Vondracek, summarized the Anderson Notter Finegold plan for the Art Deco Historic District and lobbied for its adoption by the City of Miami Beach.\n\nJune 16, 1982\n\nThe first Miami Beach Historic Preservation Ordinance, No. 82-2318, was adopted; it contained 100 percent owner consent provision.\n\nSeptember 23, 1982\n\nThe Dade County Historic Preservation Board found the Miami Beach Ordinance not in compliance with county requirements.\n\nOctober 20, 1982\n\nThe City Commission appointed the first Historic Preservation Board.\n\nJanuary 31, 1983\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior found the Miami Beach Ordinance to be in compliance with National Register standards for local governments.\n\nApril 20, 1983\n\nOrdinance No. 83-2367 amended Historic Preservation Ordinance No. 82-2318, changing owner consent from 100 percent to 51 percent required for designation.\n\nMay 4-7, 1983\n\nThe Art Deco District came to the attention of the art world as a result of “Surrounded Islands,” an installation by artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude in which a series of 11 islands in Biscayne Bay were wrapped in pink fabric. During the installation, the artists established their “headquarters” in the Art Deco District.\n\nAugust 15, 1983\n\nDade County and others filed a lawsuit to invalidate the Miami Beach Historic Preservation Ordinance.\n\nOctober 5, 1983\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 83-2388 designating the Old City Hall building as the city’s first Historic Preservation Site.\n\nFebruary 1, 1984\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 84-2402 designating the 21st Street Community Center a Historic Preservation Site.\n\nApril 4, 1984\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 84-2405 creating a Design Review Board.\n\n1984-1989\n\nThe Art Deco District achieved worldwide recognition as a result of the hit television show Miami Vice, starring Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. The show used the Art Deco District as a backdrop in many of the episodes.\n\nFebruary 6, 1985\n\nThe City Commission adopted the Ocean Drive plan containing recommendations for local Historic District designation.\n\nMarch 20, 1985\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 85-2470 eliminating the owner consent provision from Historic Preservation ordinances.\n\nOctober 16, 1985\n\nThe City Commission adopted the Espanola Way plan containing a recommendation for local Historic District designation.\n\n1985\n\nRenowned fashion photographer Bruce Weber chose Miami Beach’s Breakwater Hotel for a photo shoot for an ad for Calvin Klein’s “Obsession,” spurring an onslaught of fashion photography shoots in the Art Deco District.\n\nJuly 23, 1986\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 86-2511 designating the Espanola Way District and the Ocean Drive/Collins Avenue District as Miami Beach’s first Historic Preservation districts. These ordinances were adopted after significant grassroots efforts by MDPL.\n\n1986\n\n“Our Drive…Ocean Drive” was a joint campaign by MDPL and its sister organization, the Miami Beach Development Corporation (MBDC), now renamed the Miami Beach Community Development Corporation (MBCDC). As a result, a $3 million bond package was approved to fund the widening of the sidewalk on the west side of Ocean Drive, allowing hotels to establish sidewalk cafes. On the east side of the street, a wide promenade was created along the wall separating Lummus Park from the beach.\n\n1986-1988\n\nMDPL campaigned for local designation of the entire National Register District and revisions to the zoning codes to make them more compatible with historic preservation.\n\nMDPL started the SOS (Save Our Senator) campaign to prevent demolition of the Senator Hotel. Although the hotel was demolished ( October 13, 1988 ), MDPL’s efforts delayed demolition for more than a year. The public outcry that MDPL created resulted in the City Commission passing a strengthened local preservation ordinance that could prevent demolition.\n\n1987\n\nThe Biscaya Hotel (1925), at 650 West Avenue, was demolished. MDPL mounted an unsuccessful campaign to save the hotel, originally the Floridian Hotel and the last remaining example of the grand bayside hotels.\n\nMay 6, 1987\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 87-2665 designating Altos del Mar a Historic Preservation District.\n\nJanuary 1988\n\nThe Poinciana Hotel (Albert Anis, 1939), at 1555 Collins Avenue, was demolished.\n\nFebruary 3, 1988\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 88-2598, strengthening the demolition section of the Historic Preservation Ordinance.\n\nMay 1988\n\nMiami Beach Art Deco Guide was published by MDPL. The guidebook, written by Keith Root with editorial assistance by Dr. Ernest Martin and Michael Kinerk, contained six self-guided walking tours of the Art Deco District.\n\nOctober 13th, 1988\n\nThe Senator Hotel (L. Murray Dixon, 1939), at 1201 Collins Avenue, was demolished.\n\nJune 1988\n\nDeco Delights: Preserving the Beauty and Joy of Miami Beach Architecture, written by MDPL founder Barbara Baer Capitman, was published by E.P. Dutton.\n\nJune 1, 1988\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 88-2616 placing the Architectural District under Design Review jurisdiction.\n\nApril 5, 1989\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 89-2637 designating the Venetian Causeway (1926) a Historic Preservation Site.\n\nSeptember 7 & 21, 1989\n\nThe City Commission nominated the Flamingo and Museum neighborhoods for Historic Preservation Districts designation. The Museum area was nominated as a local historic district or collection of historic sites depending on the findings of the Historic Preservation Board.\n\nMarch 29, 1990\n\nBarbara Baer Capitman died of congestive heart failure. Capitman was memorialized with obituaries in Time and Newsweek magazines as well as the Miami Herald, the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers.\n\nJune 6, 1990\n\nThe City Commission deferred consideration on the first reading of nine nominated historic preservation sites.\n\nJune 20, 1990\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 90-2698 designating the Flamingo Park and Museum Historic Preservation Districts.\n\nJanuary 1991\n\nMDPL organized and held the First World Congress on Art Deco ®, with the goal of promoting education of the value of preserving Art Deco’s heritage. Participants came from all over the world.\n\nApril 16, 1991\n\nFirst Lady Barbara Bush accepts a painting of the Carlyle Hotel on Ocean Drive at a presentation in the White House. Michael Kinerk, Dennis Wilhelm and artist Gustavo Novoa make the presentation on behalf of MDPL.\n\nDecember 5, 1991\n\nThe Historic Preservation Board nominated all remaining areas within the Miami Beach Architectural Historic District for local historic designation.\n\nJanuary 9, 1992\n\nThe formation of a new preservation coalition, the National Coalition of Art Deco Societies (NCADS) was created during an MDPL-sponsored meeting of the presidents of Art Deco societies from around the country and preservation representatives from several cities. This coalition was later expanded to the International Coalition of Art Deco Societies.\n\nMarch 2, 1992\n\nThe Sands Hotel (Roy F. France, 1939), at 1601 Collins Avenue, was demolished.\n\nMay 18, 1992\n\nThe Planning Board recommended that the Historic Preservation Board action be approved.\n\nJune 1992\n\nThe City Commission requested the Planning Board to hold another hearing on designating the balance of the Miami Beach Architectural Historic District as a local historic district. The reason for the request related to questions about the public notice.\n\nJuly 16, 1992\n\nThe Historic Preservation Board nominated Beth Jacob Congregation at 311 Washington Avenue as a local Historic Site.\n\nJuly 23, 1992\n\nThe Planning Board held an additional public hearing to recommend the historic preservation nomination to all remaining areas within the architectural district for local historic designation, actions continued to September 22, 1992.\n\nSeptember 23, 1992\n\nThe Planning Board recommended the nomination of all remaining areas within the architectural district for local historic designation.\n\nNovember 4, 1992\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 92-2821 expanding the Historic District to the entire mile-square Art Deco district, which protected from demolition the full area entered into the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nJanuary 20, 1993\n\nThe City Commission adopted Ordinance No. 93-2832 designating Congregation Beth Jacob a Historic Preservation Site.\n\nJune 3, 1993\n\nThe Historic Preservation Board held a public hearing to consider Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace’s application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition of the Revere Hotel (Herbert Mathes, 1950), a property that was listed as “contributing,” as opposed to “historic,” at the time the district was listed on the National Register. An order was issued granting Versace’s request after six months of vigorous protest by MDPL. The Revere Hotel was demolished to make way for Versace’s private garage and swimming pool. However, the issue focused awareness on the need to overhaul the City of Miami Beach’s Preservation Ordinance.\n\nJanuary 1994\n\nRediscovering Art Deco: A Nationwide Tour of Architectural Delights, written by MDPL founder Barbara Baer Capitman and MDPL charter members Michael D. Kinerk and Dennis W.
