        "text": "The Reformation of Europe refers to the major religious changes that swept across all of Europe during the early 1500s, transforming the way of worship, society, politics and basic cultural patterns. One key point of the Reformation of Europe was the Protestant Reformation, which began in 1517 with Martin Luther's critique of doctrinal principles and church actions in Germany and that led to the creation of new official churches. These churches being the Lutheran, the Reformed or Calvinist, and the Anglican. The Reformation of Europe brought on changes such as woman’s rights, the printing culture and The Reformation changed the role of women all throughout Europe. The Protestantism church got rid of nunneries and converts, women that had once\n\nWhen thinking about the historical events that are associated with the reformation movement that can be traced back to the late 1300s and early 1400s with men like John Wycliffe, The Lollards, and Jan Hus (Men who rejected the Divine origin of the Roman Catholic Church and the alleged authority of the Pope) I can't help but feel the table had been set, that is, the conditions were perfect for Martin Luther's placing of the ninety-five theses on the church door at Wittenberg in 1517. By God's providence Luther was to undertake the most difficult task of returning the church to its intended authority - The Scriptures. Luther understood as well as anyone the sad state of affairs as it related to the Church, the Papacy, its politics and the increasing corruption of the sale of indulgences to his fellow countrymen.\n\nIn the year 1517, a monk by the name of Martin Luther revolutionized the entire religious world by starting the Reformation movement within Europe by just posting his 95 Theses to the Castle Church doors in Wittenberg, Germany. The spread of the Reformation ideals took time until it eventually made its way to England in the early 17th century. England, throughout the years, was constantly changing politically and religiously, with some monarchs leaning towards Protestantism with an iron fist and other rulers directing the country to an extremist Catholic empire. Even when the “Elizabethan Settlement”, which was treaty that ended the religious wars between the Protestants and Catholics within England, was made there were still outcries within England for greater reforms.\n\nBefore the Reformation, the church was riddled with abuse. The church was very corrupt throughout the middle ages and it ended all acts oppositions against its authority and religious doctrine. At this point, the people questioned its views and wanted change. The Protestant Reformation all began with Martin Luther. Martin Luther, a German monk and professor of theology protested abuses in the Church and called for reform. He started by attacking the practices of Indulgences. Indulgences were a payment for the lessening of sins that popes would sell, people would essentially buy these tickets if they committed a sin. They were also referred to as “tickets to heaven.” He exposed and attacking the Indulgences by publishing the 95 Theses and was focused on dismantling the doctrine of indulgences. He first published in Latin, but it was soon translated into German and published even more widely. From Luther writing this, it open and created many more causes that led to this reformation. The creation of moveable printing press was invented due to the popularity of Luther’s ideas and help spread other ideas as well. From that point, on reformers decided something had to be done and they called for a change.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was a significant development in the Christian Church as it changed from the Catholic Church into many different denominations. This reformation took place throughout Europe (largely in Germany) during the 16th Century. This occurred because several different key figures and groups challenged the Catholic Church’s doctrine and its teachings as they were against biblical teachings. The Church’s corruptness was also challenged. The main key figure who launched the beginning of the reformation was a German monk named Martin Luther, who wrote a document that was his protest against what the Church was doing. As Luther’s protest spread throughout Europe, many Catholics joined his side, which caused many major wars. Eventually, rulings were made which led to an end in the dominance of the Church and gave the Christian people the opportunity to have their own views and opinions.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation particularly was the 16th century religious, political, scholarly and very definitely social change that separated Catholic Europe, setting in place the structures and convictions that would for the most part essentially characterize the landmass in the cutting edge time in a subtle way in a subtle way. In northern and focal Europe, reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Henry VIII tested ecclesiastical power and scrutinized the Catholic Church ' 's capacity to actually essentially characterize Christian practice, which definitely definitely is quite significant, particularly contrary to popular belief. They particularly contended for a kind of general basically religious and political redistribution of force under the control of Bible-and flyer perusing ministers and sovereigns, which really is fairly significant in a fairly major way. The disturbance activated wars, oppressions and the alleged Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church 's postponed yet intense reaction to the Protestants.The Protestant Reformation changed basically basically many things like for all intents and purposes generally religious freedom and the separation of church and state, or so they definitely thought. The first for all intents and purposes definitely major impact on our basically very modern society that actually was created by the reformers kind of for all intents and purposes is really fairly religious freedom.The definition of generally really religious\n\nThe Protestant Reformation affected religious life in the early 15th century. It was a movement that reformed the beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. At the time, the church was viewed as a wealthy and powerful institution that was practicing many corrupt ideas such as selling indulgences. Indulgences were letters of forgiveness for one’s sin. This sparked anger causing priests to revolt by calling for reforms to take place. A German priest and monk, Martin Luther became a leader throughout the Protestant Reformation. Luther among his followers known as Protestants protested against the church. Acting on his belief, Luther wrote his “95 theses” to express his questions and concerns against the church. He posted his list on the door of the Wittenberg church, the catholic church reacted by telling him to take his theses back, and recant. But, he refused and his ideas were spread throughout the printing press. He wanted Christians to believe the truth found within the bible. Luther believed that Christians could reach salvation by having faith in God. He disagreed with the thought that the pope or other priests had any special powers, including the forgiveness of sins. Everyone began to acknowledge the truth; no longer did they have to believe in corrupt ideas. Individuals gained a voice in society and could now reject any corrupt moral. As stated by Alec Ryrie “Protestantism has given us not a paradise of free speech, but an open-ended, undisciplined argument. It has continuously generated new ideas, revived old ones and questioned its own orthodoxies.” The Protestant Reformation lead individuals to question the Catholic church and seek for information. They were no longer blindfolded; the bible became available to ordinary people to read in their own language. However, Martin Luther wasn’t the only reformer. John Calvin became a reformer that believed and promoted the idea of predestination. Predestination is seen as the belief that certain people were chosen by God for salvation. As the reformation proceeded, his followers believed they were predestined for heaven. According to Ryrie, “To take the iconic example: slavery, which for centuries Christians had assumed was a necessary evil or\n\nThe Protestant Reformation would not have been made possible without the printing press. This innovation allowed ideas to spread further and quicker at rate that was never seen before. Prior to Gutenberg’s invention, the Clergymen held a powerful monopoly over the purchase of books. In spite of that, the press made books cheaper, allowing anyone and everyone to have access to them. As a result, people began to interpret books on their own and have their own independant thoughts which often opposed those of the Church. This was a huge threat to the Church, and as the popularity of the innovation grew, more people distanced themselves from the Church. In addition, the expansion of the University system helped increase the literacy rates because everyone was curious to read these books and gain knowledge from what they were saying. The printing press gave Martin Luther, the most influential figure at the time, a huge advantage.\n\nMartin Luther, named the father of Protestantism, dramatically changed Christianity through his force of will and new ideas. In 16th century Europe, Catholicism was undeniably the most powerful and influential religions in Europe. Moreover, the church had become greatly involved in the political and social life of Western Europe. This was until the Protestant Reformation began, which challenged the Church not only in it’s hierarchy, practices, and biblical interpretations, but also the widespread following of Catholicism throughout Europe. Many saw this as a threat to the whole structure of society, especially the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The abuse of power such as the sale of indulgences, relics, and the corruption of the ministry undermined the religious authority of the Roman Catholic Church. As protests against the Church began to occur, many individuals would rise to prominence and would lead the Reformation. Martin Luther and seven other theologists opened new discussions on spirituality and faith, which spread Protestantism throughout Europe. Their main goal was to return Christianity to its roots, focusing on understanding the teachings of the bible, and less on material things such as relics and indulgences. The Reformation was a significant event in religion because it allowed for religious freedom and even caused a separation of powers in the religious world. In the process, many other historical milestones where achieved such as, the 95 theses and\n\nIn a time where Europe was flourishing between the 14th and 17th centuries with their cultural development of the art and sciences, there was a huge schism in the Catholic Church that was originally created by Martin Luther. The Protestant Reformation was initiated in 1517 when the Ninety-five Theses was posted in Saxony, Germany by Luther. Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk who criticized the Church and the papacy and laid the theological reform for the church and the pope’s authority which broke the unity of Christianity. Germany, where he resided, saw many advantages breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church. No longer wanting to be taxed by the church, the princes of the country could gain economic power by establishing their own"
