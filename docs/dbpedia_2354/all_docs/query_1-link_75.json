        "text": "One of the finest examples of Hoysala Craftsmanship\n\nChennakeshava Temple, Belur, Hassan district of Karnataka. It was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE.\n\nThis pillar inside the Temple was once capable of rotating on its own axis. Narasimha Pillar is a magnificent stone pillar with a height of about 30 feet. All sculptures of the temple are carved on this pillar in miniature form.\n\nThe Narasimha Pillar is also known to have its own set of parts and ball bearings.This was initially designed so that the massive pillar can be rotated freely within a fixed circle.\n\nThe main aim was to demonstrate all of the features present in the temple complex in one single sculpture. However,at present,the rotating feature of the Pillar is not available anymore.\n\n\"NARASIMHA PILLAR\" has 6 floors. Every inch of the pillar is carved with miniature idols. There are carvings of Keshava, Sankarshana, and other eleven images, Ekadashi mudras, Dwadashi adityas, shakti devis, Bhairavi, Parvati, and Kali. And many carvings like Brahma, Narasimha, the war between gods and demons. In this pillar, there are many miniature sculptures are carved in every socket. 1 socket is deliberately left empty by our ancestors to be carved if anyone can finish it same exquisiteness.\n\nThe Temple was built over 3 generations and took 103 years to finish !!"
