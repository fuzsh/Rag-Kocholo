        "text": "Aralaguppe Chennakesava Temple, located at Aralaguppe in Tumkur District of Karnataka, is a splendid example of 13th century Hoysala architecture. The reigning deity of the temple is Lord Vishnu, also called as Chennakesava. Separate places are earmarked for the deities of Ganesh and Mahishasuramardini. Distance from Bengaluru to Chennakeshava Temple, Aralaguppe, Karnataka is 141.7 km and travelling time by road is around 2 h 26 min via NH75.\n\nAralaguppe Chennakesava Temple is exceptionally large and many of the decorations were added later in the centuries. The garbhagriha is star shaped. The pierced stone windows allow only subdued light into the temple. Almost all the major Hindu deities are represented upon the pillars and lintels of the temple. The temple walls are decorated with carved depictions of scenes from the great epics of the Ramayana and Bhagavata.\n\nTumkur Railway Station is the nearby access. Bangalore International Airport is the nearest airport."
