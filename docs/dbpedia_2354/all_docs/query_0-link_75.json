I do remember reading a while ago that Before the Belur Halebidu was thought of Hoysala's built so many temples in the region and the Icing on the cake was Belur, Halebidu .\n\nMust visit places all.\n\nThank you!\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jan 2016\n\nLocation: Mumbai\n\nPosts: 459\n\nThanked: 649 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nThanks for that wonderful informolog (informative + travelogue, ) Smartcat.\n\nHoysalas, as I understand, were meticulous in the skills of temple building. They had built several beautiful temples during their reign, a very few of which remain today. These structures were spared from the plundering blows of the invaders as their concentration focused on buildings that yielded wealth in much higher proportions. These structures that have stood the test of time, provides only a flavor of the splendid cityscapes, financial might and immaculate skills that flourished during the medieval ages.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by arunu\n\nIncase if you happen tin o travel on this route, dont miss this temple since it is maintained immaculately and fully functional with regular pujas happening on daily basis. There is another ancient Lakshmi Mata temple and Shri.Shankara Mutt inside the temple complex as well.\n\nThe entire temple complex is situated inside a \"Kote\" meaning a boundary wall OR fort and easily accessible from the NH.\n\nI have had the opportunity to visit this majestic Harihareshwara temple during May 2015, and must admit what a wonderful structure it has been. This temple portrays the thatch shaped stone roof with intricate carvings on the ceiling supported on beautifully polished (mirror finish) circular stone columns, which has been a trademark of Hoysala architecture. I am eagerly looking for more opportunities to visit such temples in Karnataka, that symbolize the bygone era.\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 6,643\n\nThanked: 45,440 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by dghosh80\n\nI was fortunate to visit many of these temples and amazed by the architecture.\n\nCan you dig out names of places (with pics) I haven't visited yet?\n\nThis month-end, I'm off again on a trip. My tentative trip plan is ready:\n\nDay 1: Drive from Bangalore to Hassan (180 km), Check In, Drive to Marle, Keshava & Siddeshwara Temple (53 km), Drive to Chikmagalur for snacks (12 kms) and back to Hassan (65 km)\n\nDay 2: Drive from Hassan to Pancha Lingeshwara Temple, Govindanahalli (55 Km), Drive To Channrayapatna for lunch (20 km), Drive to Ancient Shri Brahmeswara Temple, Kikkeri (18 km), Drive to Sri Lakshminarayana Swamy Temple, Hosaholalu (16 km). Drive to Channarayapatna for snacks (35 km). Drive back to Hassan (38 km)\n\nDay 3: , Hassan to Chennakeshava Temple, Anekere (40 km), Lunch at Channarayapatna (8 km), Drive to Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Nuggehalli (20 km) and back to Bangalore (140 km)\n\nMy trips involve lot of back-and-forth travel because of kids. Last time, my trip was not very \"efficient\", and involved covering 250+ km every day. This time, driving will be kept to a minimum since most of the temples I have picked are close to Channarayapatna (which has good restaurants on the highway). Also, this time, I'm visiting only largish temple complexes or those with unique architecture.\n\nFor some places, I think Shimoga or Davanagere might be a better 'base camp'.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2016\n\nLocation: Bengaluru\n\nPosts: 28\n\nThanked: 29 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by smartcat\n\nCan you dig out names of places (with pics) I haven't visited yet?\n\nMy trips involve lot of back-and-forth travel because of kids.

If you prefer, you can also see Pallavas architecture in places like Mahabalipuram, I find that place also a paradise for people like us. I am sure you have already visited but still thought of telling you.\n\nAnd yes, I agree with you that Shimoga can be a better base camp.\n\nRegards,\n\nGhosh\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 6,643\n\nThanked: 45,440 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nNANDI\n\nName: Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple\n\nWikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoga_Nandeeshwara_Temple\n\nDistance from Bangalore: 54 Kms\n\nLocation: Just off Nelamangala - Chickballapur highway, in Nandi village\n\nHow to Get There: Type 'Bhoga Nandishwara' in Google Maps and select 'Bhoga Nandishwara Main Temple, Nandi' from the drop-down list.\n\nNote:\n\n1) This temple was built some 300 or 400 years before Hoysalas came into power. But I have added Bhoga Nandeeshwara temple to this guide because the Hoysalas patronized this temple and have made a few 'mods' to the temple complex.\n\n2) This is NOT the temple on top of Nandi Hills. This temple is located at 'Nandi' village.\n\nBhoga Nandeeshwara Temple makes for a great first impression, with its fort-like compound:\n\nBut some mild disappointments include lots of 21st century additions like overhead wires, steel barricades, XL sized Hundis and a sizeable crowd! A quick walk-around the temple complex:\n\nInside the main shiva temple:\n\nThere are two Devi shrines outside the main shrine:\n\nA Kalyana Mantapa and a Tulabhara Mantapa\n\nCome quickly! I found a HUGE swimming pool!\n\nThe massive Sringeri Teertha Kalyani, which is supposed to be the source of minor river.\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2007\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 6,643\n\nThanked: 45,440 Times\n\nGuide To The Lesser Known Hoysala Era Temples (Vol 2)\n\nGOVINDANAHALLI\n\nName: Panchalingeshwara Temple\n\nWiki Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancha...Govindanahalli\n\nHow To Get There: Type 'Pancha Lingeshwara Temple' in Google Maps and select 'Pancha Lingeshwara Temple Govindanahalli' from the drop down list.\n\nGoogle Maps Link: https://goo.gl/maps/qQEL9YfQbLT2\n\nDistance from Hassan: 58 kms\n\nThe road to Govindanahalli:\n\nHuge temple complex makes for a great first impression:\n\nView from the gate;\n\nA walk around the temple. You can see scaffolding on the left, minor repair work going on :\n\nAmazing 5 towers architecture, each containing a Shiva Linga (hence the name)\n\nAll five towers are inter-connected by hallways:\n\nAnd we are back at the entrance:\n\nEntering the temple:\n\nView when you look left:\n\nAnd then right:\n\nView from corner of the temple. Can get a bit eerie/spooky if you are exploring alone, as if you are in the mines of Morea (Lord of The Rings)\n\nStatue of Nandi opposite Shiva Linga:"
