        "text": "As ISRO's Chandrayaan-3's Vikram moonwalking telescoped us into the future, I was reminded of my recent trip to Hassan, Karnataka, where one of its master control facilities is based. I took a detour to the small tourist town of Belur, which has an outsized reputation of its own. One is a monumental feat, while the other is a monument that is a treasure of our land and deserves to shine.\n\nThe 900-year-old Chennakeshava Swamy temple complex in Belur, Karnataka, is one such experience. It is a beauty carved in stone, a delight for the senses, and a living proof of the awe-inspiring times of our ancestors. They lived a blissful life, surcharged with a confluence between knowledge of science and spirituality before the plunderers brought in their chapter of the dark history of destruction and barbarism.\n\nTo understand ancient India, you must understand its temples and the engineering prowess that went into them. Temples were the most revered symbols of a king's power and might and their divine pursuits. The Chennakeshava Swamy temple complex in Belur was built in the 12th century by three successive generations of the Hoysala kings, and it took 103 years to complete. The monument symbolizes victory over the Chola kingdom. The temple is a masterpiece of engineering, science and artistry and a testament to the heights that the Hoysalas achieved. The precision of the details and the high standards that were set back then would now seem insurmountable to the modern generations, an architectural enigma that continues to challenge time itself.\n\nImagine a temple sculpted from soapstone, a delicate material that allows for intricate carvings and hardens over time. The sculptures exhibit a range of hues, from pale yellow and faded black to soft blues. The craftsmanship is nothing short of electrifying. Whether you are a painter, fashion designer, fine artist, scientist, or architect, the Chennakeshava temple complex is a mandatory destination for you. It seamlessly combines multidisciplinary talents, science, and heightened aesthetics.\n\nThe temple is star-shaped and reportedly has a staggering 10,000 large and small statues carved and assembled using an interlocking method I had never heard of before. Each figure is distinct from the other. The level of intricacy and complexity of its design, carved on a single piece of rock, displays the boundless talents of the ancient artisans, much like the limitless expanse of the universe itself.\n\nStep right up to the temple's grand entrance, the Gopura arch. It flaunts two majestic cow horns on both sides. Once you reach the main monument, you will see enchanting sculptures of madanikas, a total of 42 of them, each one intricately carved with great finesse. One of them is Darpana Sundari, a showstopper. Picture this: a lady holding a mirror in her left hand, adorned from head to toe in dazzling jewellery, carved with such lifelike expressions that it's as if she's just caught her breath. She is the emblem and crown jewel of Karnataka tourism, drawing millions of visitors every year. And speaking of emblems, flanking the steps are the Hoysala kings' royal insignias: a lion, powerful, fierce, and dripping with regal vibes.\n\nYou will see a cascade of creativity as you sidestep and glance up at the monument. The monument's base is a tiered masterpiece, with a running strip or band form of 644 elephants. No two elephants are alike; each carving is unique. Shift your gaze to the next band, where you will see a cavalry of horsemen in various gallant poses. Slide up a notch, and you will suddenly be in a miniature world of madanikas, boasting 620 different hairstyles. Dancers, musicians, and all sorts of characters join the party. We're not done yet. Tilt your head up, and let your eyes feast on scenes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana, chiselled into the stone like an epic tale frozen in time. With nothing more than a chisel, a hammer, stones, and heaps of boundless imagination, this monument has stories hewn from rock, and imagination dances through every carved corner.\n\nI walked past a filigree work. The delicate lace-like artistry looked so effortless that it felt like I was in a staring contest. All the fellow tourists' retinas had a hard time keeping their eyeballs steady. Apparently, Kafur Malik and Tughlak squinted at these creations and, unable to bear the affront to their senses, moved to flattening, raising, and disfiguring the monument. They were like medieval school bullies vandalizing your textbooks or slapping gum on your uniform.\n\nEven after 900 years, the stone pillars gleam and glow. No ancient secrets are spilled here about how they achieved this engineering feat. Again, no pillars are alike. Each has a unique shape: bells, flowers, umbrellas, stars, diamonds. The dark interiors of the temple transform into a living canvas of light as beams dance and rays run wild, painting the interiors with their brand of magic. There is a centre stage and a domed ceiling about 10 feet in diameter and 6 feet deep on the top. The four iconic madanikas on each side strike a pose at four corners. If you look up, there are 48 stone carvings and pieces defying gravity and doing the balancing act to hold everything in place for the last 900 years.\n\nWhile exiting the monument, you will see a pillar approximately 36 feet high and weighing 16,000 kg. It is a showstopper that defies the laws of physics. The pillar is not firmly rooted to the base nor supported from above or sideways. It stands on three sides, touching the ground, while the fourth side remains untouched. There is a gap through which you can pass a piece of paper or cloth."
