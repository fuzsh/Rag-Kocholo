        "text": "Distinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2013\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,817\n\nThanked: 5,575 Times\n\nRe: Guide to the lesser known Hoysala Era Temples\n\nA big shoutout to smartcat for putting this Tlog together and sharing all the required information. Smartcat - apologizing in advance for hijacking your thread but I think its better if all info can be consolidated in one thread.\n\nDid a daytrip yesterday and covered one set of temples. Route taken. Will try not to repeat information that smartcat has shared and keep it to additional info and pics that provide a different perspective/detail.\n\nThe weather was perfect yesterday with a mix of rain and lots of cloud cover. Hardly any sunshine, which means that the pics look a little dull and do not do justice to the beauty and effort that has gone into making these songs in stone.\n\nDecided to go to the Mavinkere temple first as it had been a while since I drove on SH121 . More details about the temple and route here (not a Hoysala temple). Started from home at 6.15 am and was at Mavinkere temple at 9 am after a quick breakfast stop at Swati delicacy. Next stop - Twin temples at Mosale.\n\nA little bit of green on the way to mosale\n\nA regular at the haunt\n\nSymmetry\n\nIts all in the details\n\nTrick shot - Need to get onto the road towards the lake for this perspective\n\nKoravangala was the next stop and what a beauty it turned out to be. Was a little perplexed by the layout of the temple as most hindu temples have the main entrance facing the deity. You typically enter the temple complex and run into a 'dwaja sthamba' which aligns you to the direction of the sanctum sanctorum. In this case the entrance does not align to the sanctum sanctorum but in no way does it deter from the beauty of this petite temple.\n\nDifferent alignment\n\nThe banana flower design. In a lot of temples you will see this design in the ceiling, with the center piece designed to look like a banana flower. My imagination fails when I try to estimate the time & effort required to carve something like this in stone.\n\nBanana flower ceiling\n\nRequest/Dedication stone - My assumption as I did see this in a lot of temples\n\nDoddagaddavali was the next stop and its quiet easy to locate as Belur road has a big hoarding on your left (when coming for Hassan) indicating the turnoff.\n\nTemple complex\n\nTemple contains 4 deities - Lakshmi devi, Narayana, Shiva & Kali. Kalidevi is not a commonly worshiped goddess in this part of the country.\n\n'Betala' standing guard!\n\nLord Shiva holding a rudra veena after tandava\n\nMakara A mythical beast with trunk of an elephant, eye of a cat, body of a boar, legs of a bull and tail of a peacock.\n\n8 Directions Every section in the ceiling which represents one of the 8 corners is carved with special detail. This if I remember right is Lord Varuna with his consort & Ishvara Parvati on the Nandi\n\nA different layout Here again the temple layout is a little hard to comprehend as the temple entrance does not align with the placement of the deities. The Narayana idol was stolen a decade ago and now is in the UK(Not surprised!). Apparently PM Modi has got assurances from the brits that the idol will be shipped back to India and will be reinstalled here.\n\nPlan was to stop at Halebeedu if there was not much crowd but the volume of buses parked on the road completed the story. We quietly zipped by towards Belavadi.\n\nBelavadi Veeranarayana temple has to be my pick of this trip as the beauty of the place lies in the exquisite idols in the sanctum sanctorum. The priest informed us that the idols were made from Saligrama shila (fossilized black stone. The Balaji idol in Tirupati is also said to be made of the same stone) and when you view the idols, you cannot ignore the radiance. Veeranarayana, Gopala & Yoga Narasimha - all 3 are beautifully carved and a treat to the eye.\n\nTemple entrance gate & dwaja sthamba\n\nMassive bell shaped Pillars\n\nThe orientation of the temple is so arrow straight that during the spring (vernal) equinox, first rays during sunrise fall directly on the Veeranarayana idol and light it up - as claimed by the priest. Planning to verify this by travelling there in March 2017 and witnessing the same.\n\nTemple complex\n\nDetailing\n\nHoy - Sala\n\nQuote:\n\nKannada folklore tells a tale of a young man Sala, who saved his Jain guru Sudatta by striking dead a Tiger he encountered near the temple of the Goddess Vasantika at Angadi, now called Sosevuru. The word \"strike\" literally translates to \"hoy\" in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada), hence the name \"Hoy-sala\". This legend first appeared in the Belur inscription of Vishnuvardhana, but owing to several inconsistencies in the Sala story it remains in the realm of folklore.The legend may have come into existence or gained popularity after King Vishnuvardhana's victory over the Cholas at Talakad as the Hoysala emblem depicts the fight between the mythical warrior Sala and a tiger, the tiger being the emblem of the Cholas\n\nSource - Wikipedia\n\nJavagal & Arkere are relatively smaller temples. Javagal temple wasn't open and we just spent a few minutes walking around snapping a few pics. Arkere is again a small temple but the highlight of this temple was the Lakshmi Narasimha idol - you dont often see idols depicting Lakshmi sitting on Narasimha's lap.\n\nJavagal temple\n\nVishnu on Adishesha\n\nTank next to the Arkere temple\n\nArsikere was the last stop and we managed to get there amidst a steady drizzle. There was some crowd as the temple is well known. The exquisite dance hall outside the temple is a work of art and sitting there watching the rain was an experience\n\nThe dome like top structure on the dance hall seems out of place as most Hyosala roof structures are either step like pyramids or flat structures. Same is the case with the Nandi on the main temple gopuram - never seen anything like that before. Both seem like an afterthought or recent additions in my opinion.\n\nTemple & Dance hall\n\nTemple complex\n\nDwarf & the temple\n\nChronologiacal Summary\n\n06.15 am - Ignition\n\n07.10 am - Breakfast stop @ Swati Delicacy\n\n09.00 am - Mavinkene temple\n\n09.45 am - Mosale - Twin temples\n\n11.15 am - Koravangala\n\n12.15 pm - Lunch break at Mallige residency - Hassan\n\n01.15 pm - Doddagaddavali\n\n02.30 pm - Belavadi via Halebeedu\n\n03.40 pm - Javagal\n\n04.00 pm - Arkere\n\n04.30 pm - Pit stop at Coffee Day outside Arsikere\n\n05.00 pm - Arsikere Ishvara temple\n\n06.40 pm - Pit stop at Swati Delicacy for dinner\n\n09.25 pm - Home sweet home\n\nI had planned the route in such a way that I can get to the next temple in 20-30 min from the previous one. Even though it was a long day and I ended up driving 520+ kms, it was not very tiring thanks to the decent roads, breaks and the sight seeing in between.\n\nRoad condition - Roads are all good and you just need to follow google maps till the village turnoffs and then ask around to get to the temple entrance. Parag had mentioned that Halebeedu - Javagal had quiet a few broken patches but the road seems to have a relatively new surface and its a bliss to drive on. Apart from the Banavara - Arsikere stretch where there is traffic, all the other roads have minimal traffic and it was just perfect given the weather. Even the Arsikere - CR Patna stretch is a good drive but you do need to keep a watch out for the usual suspects - cattle, 2 wheelers and the occasional idiot in the car.\n\nAll in all a great way to spend a Saturday! Now I need to plan the second leg."
