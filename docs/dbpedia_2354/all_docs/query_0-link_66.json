        "text": "ㅤ A few days back, I received a text from my good old friend from Shivamogga who used to follow my travel blog and Instagram posts, which said “bro, it’s good that you’re visiting all these offbeat gems at our place, but please don’t post anything about these places in any social media. People visit more often here now and just litter around everywhere”. While I sincerely admire his concern towards preserving the sanctity of these beautiful hidden places, I believe that real awareness should be in how to preserve the naturality of these places and keep them clean from visitors with strict measures rather than hiding them in secret from whole world.\n\nㅤ Though many people travel out only for the sake of vacation to relax themselves or visiting famous places, there are few real nature, adventure and wildlife enthusiastics who are very passionate about what they do and know the value of it. With that in mind, I’m presenting this short and only informative blog about one such real hidden beauty in the Mudigere taluk of the Coffee Land of Karnataka, Chikkamagaluru.\n\nKodige Falls: Is a very less known, yet really beautiful waterfalls formed by a stream of Netravathi river in the thick evergreen forest lands of westerghats region. Surrounded by coffee and Areca Nut estates, waterfalls falls from the height of nearly 120ft in two cascades marking an ideal place to spend time with friends and family. With clean and no so deep waters, waterfalls is also children friendly. With changing rooms available, it’s a perfect destination to have one good natural shower and a jacuzzi bath.\n\nLocation: Kodige Private estates, Durgadahalli Village, Sunkasale Post, Mudigere Taluq, Chikkamagaluru district, Karnataka.\n\nPlace is 65 kms from Chikkamagaluru, 35kms from Mudigere and 27kms from Kalasa, another famous pilgrimage centre in Karnataka.\n\nHow to reach?\n\nBy Road: Travelling from Bangalore to Mangalore via Charmadi ghat, take a right deviation at Kottigehara junction and travel for 17 kms more to reach Sunkasale. Take left deviation and traverse for another 3kms to reach Durgadahalli. Good option is to hire a jeep from here, for next 2kms of offbeat ride through estates. Driving regular cars is not advisable on these roads, but you can do a short walk for 30mins to reach the place.\n\nBy train: Chikkamagaluru railway station is the nearest one at a distance of 70kms. Local taxis, cars or bikes can be hired from here.\n\nBest Time to Visit: Monsoon and post monsoon months of July to December.\n\nTimings: 8AM to 5PM. Open on all days of the week.\n\nFacilities available: Vehicle Parking, Toilets, Men & Women Changing rooms and a small shop which sells coffee, tea and light snacks.\n\nPlaces to Stay: Sunkasale and Durgadahalli have many homestays with wide range of budget. Mudigere or Kalasa can also be preferred if you are looking for more comfortable stays.\n\nPersonal recommendation is Durgadahalli Homestay, which is run by a friendly localite Sanjay (Contact: 9449701866) for a comfy and price worthy stay. Jeep facility will also be arranged upon request.\n\nPlaces nearby to Visit:\n\nBandaje Arbi & Ballarayanadurga: One of the most scenic treks in Sahyadri mountains. Trekking start point and famous Rani Jhari view point is 5kms away from Kodige Falls.\n\nKelagur Tea Estate: Tea estates famous for scenic views and local tea shopping. 7kms away.\n\nHemavathi Ugama Stana: Sacred birth place of Hemavathi river, 13kms away.\n\nKalasa & Horanadu: Two of the famous pilgrimage centres of Karnataka, dedicated to Lord Kalaseshwara and Goddess Annapoorneshwari. 27kms & 32kms away respectively.\n\nDevaramane: Famous valley view point of western ghats. 32kms away.\n\nTake Away & A Humble Request: Its one of the most secluded and beautiful waterfalls you can come across. Though it is in a private land, it will treat you with a homely feeling. The roaring waters astonishingly drop down with spreading peace all around. If you are in here with your family or friends, you will most surely enjoy the place to its best."
