It was built by Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, the King of Mysuru under the guidance of his Diwan Bharat Ratna Sir M. Visvesvaraya. This project is very unique because of the technology that is used. This was arguably the first dam to get built using the Siphon system. Here, siphons are installed designed in such a way that when the dam reaches its maximum capacity, these siphons naturally allow water to pass through the gates. Unlike other dams where the gates are always closed to stop the flow of water, here at Markonahalli the gates are always open and the water doesn’t flow unless the dam is full. This dam uses the principle of air flow and is truly an example of quality engineering of that time and the genius of Bharat Ratna Sir M. Visvesvaraya who is regarded as the architect of modern Karnataka.\n\nPavagada: Pavagada is a taluk headquarter known for popular Pavagada Fort.

It is believed that Jakanachari was the master sculptor who built the world famous Belur Chennakeshava Temple. However, this temple at Kaidala lacks the magnificence of the Belur Chennakeshava Temple but the idol of the deity is almost the same as the one in Belur. The 5 feet 6 inches tall deity of Lord Chennakeshava, in black stone is flanked by Sridevi and Bhoodevi. The pillars are beautifully carved with sculptures adorning them.An interesting legend is associated with this temple. Once, Jakanachari leaves behind his wife and unborn child to pursue his art and attain fame by building temples. Time passes and he builds numerous statues and temples. He reaches Belur wherein he agrees to sculpt the Chennakeshava Temple, which across time has now become one of the best specimens of Hoysala architecture. Meanwhile his son Dankanachari, now all grown up, leaves home in search of his father. Dankanachari reaches Belur and goes to inspect the sculptures. He points out a flaw in an idol in the temple. Angered, Jakanachari refuses to accept that there could be a blemish and vows that he will cut off his own hand if a flaw is found.Then the statue was covered with sandal paste which dried on every part except the navel area. Dankanachari picked a stick and poked it wherein they saw a frog sitting in the damp cavity. As vowed, Jakanachari cut his right hand. The statue became famous as ‘Kappe Channigaraya’ (Kappe means Frog in Kannada). Curious about this young man who had mastered such perfection in sculpting, Jakanachari enquired about him and to his great surprise, Jakanachari found that Dankanachari was his own son.Later, Jakanachari gets a vision to construct a Chennakeshava Temple at his home town, Kaidala. The father-son duo then move to Kaidala where it is said that Jakanachari got back his hand after he completed the temple construction (hence the name Kaidala (Kai means hand in Kannda). So, Jakanachari was reunited with his wife and son.\n\nTuruvekere: Turuvekere was once an ‘Agrahara’ (an area of land which was provided to scholarly brahmins priests) in the 13th century AD by the Hoysala kings.
