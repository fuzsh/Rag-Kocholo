Chenna Keshava Temple, Aralaguppe, Karnataka, is located 64 km west of Tumakuru.

Built in 1250 by Hoysala king Vira Someshwara, this Ekakuta temple is a splendid example of Hoysala architecture and artistry.

The ornamentation here is extra ordinary. The lathe turned pillars and heavily ornamented navaranga ceiling panels adorn the Mahamantapa – we were asked not to take pictures inside.

The two-eave external wall structure is filled with sculptures, decorated deities and reliefs along side well-chiselled miniature towers.

On the southern side there’s a Narasimha temple.

What a marvel!
