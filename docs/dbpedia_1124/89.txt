Sweden - Ranking among the coolest venues in the world, Dalhalla is located in a 60m deep former limestone quarry, seven kilometres north of beautiful Lake Siljan and the town of Rättvik in central Sweden.

The 4000 capacity open air theatre was opened in 1995 and presents a summer season of around 30 performances - from operatic and choral works to full on rock 'n' roll.

This year's festival production lighting design by Anders 'Hebbe' Herbertzon from High Voltage Designs includes Robe MMXs and LEDWash 600s which were recently purchased by locally based lighting rental company Park Brothers, and delivered by Robe's Swedish distributor, Bellalite.

Hebbe has lit the Dalhalla Summer Season for Park Brothers for the last three years - also using Robes - including ColorWash 1200E ATs and ColorSpot 2500 and 700E ATs.

The Dalhalla design is based on two 17.6m long trusses hung under the industrial roof structure. Other lights are rigged from four catwalks which are part of the roof structure designed by Jesper Källquist for Park Brothers.

On the front catwalk are eight LEDWash 600s. The back and mid trusses have six MMX Spots and six ColorWash 1200E ATs each, and there are another eight Robe ColorWash 1200E ATs on the floor.

This is the basic 'house' rig, together with some conventionals - to which bands can add floor specials packages if they wish.

The LEDWash 600s are used for washing the full stage and general front lighting focused down onto the forestage. They have been used on numerous shows since arriving at Park Brothers' busy warehouse.
