It’s the first time a company has successfully invoked the NSW Mines Resource Act to gain access to a significant modern Australian site. The Act, which is often invoked in rural Australia, states that the Crown owns all minerals beneath the subsurface and can grant a company the right to mine beneath a property if it is found that the claimant can establish that the value of the minerals to the community outweighs the value of the structure itself. ‘They’re not breaking the law,’ said John Furphy, the barrister representing the Fèihuà Chinese Corporation. ‘The Crown is legally entitled to grant exploratory or mining licences to mining companies, so they can explore or extract sub-surface minerals. They do it all the time. And it’s not like we’re gonna lose the Opera House altogether. Plans are underway already to relocate it to a lovely site in Penrith.’ The Sydney Arts community is reeling from the news. ‘I can’t believe it’s happening, but what can we do? The government is backing it. Profits are just more important than culture,’ said Ima Lyah, a spokesperson for the NSW Arts Council. The open cut coalmine is expected to be approximately 1-5 kms in diameter and may see more of Sydney’s CBD be impacted in the deal between the Australian government and The Fèihuà Chinese Corporation. https://lnkd.in/gzkh-BPK\n\nThis is a Brazilian Pau tree, a tree that grows in the American Atlantic forests in the South. The characteristic reddish color of the Pau of Brazil comes from the iron oxide particles that it extracts and that turns it into an incorruptible wood. It is one of the hardest and densest woods in the world (there are two that surpass it) and it has a color when cut that is close to fuchsia but with oxidation, it turns dark brown over time. It has a dense, orange-red wood (which takes a high shine), and it is the most frequently used wood for making bows for string instruments from the VIOLIN family. The wood also gives a red dye called BRAZILIN (https://lnkd.in/eFCaAe-S . https://lnkd.in/ex4XyjPF\n\nMany people believe that an alien presence has existed on Mount Shasta. Might these legends be connected back in time to even older legends about extraterrestrials originating on distant continents? Is it possible that the Anunnaki could have reached the gold-rich shores of the Pacific Northwest over 10,000 years ago, before the modern gold rush? Gold mining is one of the oldest known trades practiced by mankind, dating back tens of thousands of years into the past. The exact origin of where mining first appeared is lost to history. One of the most popular alternative theories suggests that mining was first undertaken on this planet by a giant race of extraterrestrials in ancient Sumeria known as the Anunnaki. The gods who descended from the heavens to the earth and who genetically engineered humankind in their own likeness as a slave species of primitive workers. Mount Shasta is not just a towering peak in Northern California; it's a storied monument to Earth's ancient past, shrouded in mystery and legend. \"Mount Shasta's Hidden Epochs: Unveiling the Legacy of the Ancients\" is a captivating documentary inspired by Dustin Naef's seminal work, revealing a world where myth, history, and cosmic intrigue converge. This film delves into the shadowy recesses of Mount Shasta's lore, from its association with the Devil's Abode in the Castle Crags to the profound secrets buried beneath its surface. The narrative unfolds with the intriguing tale of J.C. Brown, a miner who stumbled upon a hidden underground city filled with artifacts and the remnants of a giant race, possibly the descendants of the Nephilim or the Anunnaki, ancient beings rumored to have engineered humanity as a workforce for their gold-mining operations. As we explore the connection between these celestial visitors and the mountain, the documentary weaves together the lore of lost civilizations such as Lemuria and Atlantis, suggesting that Mount Shasta may hold the keys to understanding our planet's most profound mysteries. Through expert interviews, archaeological findings, and a journey into the heart of the mountain's most secluded spots, \"Mount Shasta's Hidden Epochs\" investigates the legends of ancient gold mining attributed to extraterrestrial activity and the sophisticated technologies they might have left behind. This film is an invitation to gaze beyond the visible, to question the narratives of human history, and to ponder the possibility of otherworldly influences on our ancient past. \"Mount Shasta's Hidden Epochs\" is more than a documentary; it's a passage through time, revealing a saga of ancient wonders and celestial secrets that have whispered through the ages, beckoning the bold to uncover the truth hidden within the mystic silhouette of Mount Shasta."
