        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe boreal forest belt runs circumpolar in the Northern Hemisphere and comprises more than 30% of all global forest area, with Russia and Canada having by far the largest area covered in forest (FAO 2006). Although northern Europe has a comparatively small forested area, forests are the dominant ecosystem type, and the forest industry is a major export industry in several northern European countries. For example, intensive forestry has been conducted since the mid 20th century in Sweden on a large proportion of the productive forest land, and this has led to even‐aged and fragmented forest landscapes with small amounts of important features for biodiversity such as dead wood and old trees (Östlund, Zackrisson & Axelsson 1997; Löfman & Kouki 2001). In the past boreal forests were mainly shaped by fire (Zackrisson 1977), leading to a dynamic forest structure consisting of stands with different ages (Angelstam 1998). As a consequence of fire exclusion and suppression, today few natural forests remain and hundreds of species are threatened (Esseen et al. 1997; Gärdenfors 2005). To mitigate this situation, reserves have been established with the aim of maintaining natural functions and processes, and preserving indigenous species in viable populations (Swedish Government 2005). Today, 1% of the productive boreal forests in Sweden below the mountain region are protected in reserves or in national parks (Anonymous 2007a).\n\nTo rationalize the process of finding and designing reserves, a systematic approach to conservation planning has been developed in which complementarity and representativeness are key aspects (Margules & Pressey 2000). One way for forests in a reserve network to represent a natural range of structures and composition is to include different successional stages (Junninen et al. 2006). This composition approach has been largely overlooked in forest conservation strategies. For instance, in boreal Sweden, 76% of the protected forests are over 100 years and only 1·5% are under 15 years (NFI data). Since humans have affected the forests in boreal Fennoscandia for centuries, knowledge of the natural age composition in the forest landscape is lacking. Most probably, the amount of open areas and remnant structures varied substantially in space and time depending on disturbance pattern, indicating a complex forest composition (Kuuluvainen 2009).\n\nA post‐disturbance deciduous forest with large amounts of dead wood is one of the most species‐rich forest types in the boreal zone because of the possibility of existence for species adapted to both early and late successional stages (Esseen et al. 1997). Young natural forests have a unique species composition not found in any other successional stage (Spies & Franklin 1991; Swanson et al. 2010) and early successional stages are considered important for the protection of some red‐listed species (Tikkanen et al. 2006). Many of the species associated with old‐growth forests might not be dependent on old forests per se, but more on structures occurring there, e.g. dead wood (Kouki et al. 2001).\n\nTo our knowledge, research has not been conducted on the value of including forests of different ages in boreal forest reserve networks. The annual National Forest Inventory (NFI) in Sweden offers an opportunity for such studies because of the large number of plots surveyed and the data collected on a number of structural variables such as dead wood, tree species, tree sizes and ages (Ranneby et al. 1987). Since the economic value of forests varies greatly with forest age, economic aspects are also important to consider, and can be calculated with high precision for the NFI plots.\n\nThe main aim of our study was to analyse the cost‐effectiveness and biodiversity potential of protecting forests in different age classes. To investigate this, optimal combinations of forest age classes with different constraints regarding area and budget were identified. A reserve selection framework building on optimization models was applied with the potential for biodiversity assessed from structural forest characteristics. In addition, geographical differences in the distribution of reserves were studied using models constrained by area and budget.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nStudy area and NFI\n\nThe study area covered the counties of Värmland, Örebro, Dalarna, Gävleborg, Jämtland, Västernorrland, Västerbotten and Norrbotten (about 14 million ha of productive forest land), an area roughly coinciding with the boreal zone in Sweden (Ahti, Hämet‐Ahti & Jalas 1968). The boreal forest is characterized by a relatively homogeneous structure dominated by Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. and Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst. The main broad‐leaved trees are birches Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh. and aspen Populus tremula L. (Gustafsson & Ahlén 1996).\n\nNFI is an annual survey of all land in Sweden that started in 1923 (Anonymous 1932), with a present systematic cluster design that was established in 1983 (Ranneby et al. 1987). Circular sample plots with a diameter of 7 or 10 m are clustered along the borders of square tracts, with a total of approximately 11 000 plots surveyed each year (Anonymous 2007b). Two‐thirds of the tracts are permanent and are surveyed every fifth year, whereas the remaining one‐third of the tracts are surveyed only once. Plot numbers and tract sizes differ between regions and between permanent and temporary tracts (Anonymous 2005).\n\nIn this study, temporary and permanent NFI‐plots within the study area were used from productive forest land outside of reserves and surveyed between the years 2003 and 2007 (17 599 plots in total). For the analysis, the plots were aggregated into 112 larger 50 × 50 km plots; 292 NFI‐plots were excluded since a 50 × 50 km plot had to contain a minimum of 30 NFI‐plots. The excluded plots were located along the outer border of the study area. The 50 × 50 km plots were in turn grouped into 6 geographical regions ( ) matching administrative county borders. Four smaller counties were grouped together (two and two) in order to make the regions more equally sized. The forest within each aggregated 50 × 50 km plot was divided into five age classes: 0–14, 15–39, 40–69, 70–99 and ≥ 100 years, with the total area in each age class comprising 2·3, 3·4, 2·9, 2·0 and 3·6 million ha respectively. Age class division was based on the introduction of tree retention practices (Lindenmayer & Franklin 2003) about 15 years ago, and on a normal rotation time of about 100 years.\n\nBiodiversity indicators\n\nStructure‐based indicators registered in the NFI were used as proxies for biodiversity potential. We chose indicators based on what are commonly thought to be the important substrates and environmental conditions for a majority of forest species (Ferris & Humphrey 1999; Lindenmayer, Margules & Botkin 2000; Spanos & Feest 2007): structural heterogeneity in the form of gaps and water dynamics (Kuuluvainen 2002); uneven age and multi‐layered tree canopy (Esseen et al. 1997); deciduous trees (both old trees in conifer forests and younger ones in early successional deciduous forests) (Hagar 2007); and large‐diameter trees and dead wood (Nilsson, Hedin & Niklasson 2001; Siitonen 2001). The underlying assumption was that the potential for high richness of indigenous species, including rare species, would increase if the presence of structural indicators was maximized. Forests with large trees, plentiful dead wood and dying trees, and a high proportion of broad‐leaved trees should currently be prioritized in forest conservation according to political guidelines (Swedish Government. 2005).\n\nThe registration of each indicator on the NFI plots was translated into a point between 0 and 100 ( ), and each aggregated 50 × 50 km plot was given a biodiversity indicator point ha−1 for each indicator and age class. The biodiversity indicator point ha−1 was calculated as the sum of points (for each indicator) from all NFI plots in the 50 × 50 km plot (in each age class) divided by the total area that all NFI plots in the 50 × 50 km plot (in each age class) represent. The indicator ‘volume of dead wood’ was calculated as the total volume of dead wood (for each age class) in the 50 × 50 km plot divided by the total area (for each age class). This point was normalized from 0 to 100 for all volumes less than or equal to 20 m3 ha−1. Volumes greater than 20 m3 ha−1 were given 100 points to avoid disproportional influence of outliers. The presence of the exotic Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm and the stand character ‘plantation character’ (no structures from previous stands, > 90% of the trees of the same species, even‐aged and consisting of one layer) were considered negative for biodiversity, and plots with these registrations were excluded from the selection (1005 plots) since it would not be realistic to establish a reserve in an area containing a plantation.\n\nTable 1\n\nIndicator100 points50 points0 pointsUneven age1 Not even‐agedFairly even‐agedCompletely even‐agedGaps2 Several gapsSome gapsNo gapsStand character3 PristineNormalTree layer4 Fully layered/several layersTwo layersOne layer/no layerGround structure5 Very uneven/fairly uneven Fairly evenVery evenLarge pine>40 cm dbh>30 cm dbhNot presentLarge spruce>40 cm dbh>30 cm dbhNot presentLarge birch>40 cm dbh>30 cm dbhNot presentLarge aspen>40 cm dbh>30 cm dbhNot presentLarge deciduous tree (other than aspen or birch)>40 cm dbh>30 cm dbhNot presentDead conifer tree lyingTree > 20 cm dbhNot presentDead deciduous tree lyingTree > 20 cm dbhNot presentDead conifer tree standingTree > 20 cm dbhNot presentDead deciduous tree standingTree > 20 cm dbhNot presentPresence of rowanPresentNot presentAffected by water (moving water/spring/temporarily flooded)YesNoVolume of dead wood>20 m3 ha−1 ≤ 20 m3 ha−1*\n\nOpportunity cost\n\nThe opportunity cost, i.e. the economic value of the plots, was estimated by using the net present value (NPV) from future forestry activities. The NPV was based on the sum of income and cost of future activities from timber harvest from period one to infinity discounted back to today with a 3% interest rate. This is consistent with the value of an investment of moderate risk in northern Europe (Ibbotson & Sinquefield 1986). For each plot, up to 100 different treatment schedules were first simulated using the Heureka system and then the most profitable schedule was selected to calculate the economic value. The Heureka system is a newly developed planning system for multiple‐use forestry (Lämås et al. 2006). Each treatment schedule consisted of variable timing for the associated silvicultural activities from period one to infinity (i.e. thinning and clear cutting with appropriate regeneration following a harvest). Economic data (timber, regeneration and harvesting costs) used for calculating the NPV for each schedule were based on a timber price list for 2008 retrieved from the forest owners’ association in northern Sweden, and was representative for the region.\n\nDecision models\n\nThere were large differences in points between indicators; therefore a method that could accommodate these variations was essential. When using ordinary linear programming (LP) it is necessary to find weights for each indicator to include into one single objective function. We used a goal programming approach to allow impartial treatment of all indicators and avoid manual weight determination. In a two‐phase approach, we first found the best possible outcome for each indicator, which became a goal. In the second phase, we searched for a solution that was as close as possible to each individual indicator goal but that considered all indicators at the same time. Each of the models used are described below (see for parameters and decision variables).\n\nTable 2\n\nNotationDescriptionParameters I Set of 50 × 50 km plots (i = 1,...,n) T Set of age classes (t = 1,...,m) E Set of biodiversity indicators (e = 1,...,o) p ite Point of biodiversity indicator e in plot i and age class t a it Area (ha) of plot i in age class t c it Cost ha−1 of plot i and age class t w e Weight of biodiversity indicator e q Maximum proportion that can be selected b Available budget (SEK)Decision variables x it Area (ha) selected in plot i and age class t\n\nThe first LP problem can be formulated as follows:\n\n(eqn 1)\n\nsubject to\n\n(eqn 2)\n\n(eqn 3)\n\n(eqn 4)\n\n(eqn 5)\n\nThe objective function, (eqn 5), (eqn 1b), maximizes the sum of the points from the biodiversity indicators in the selected areas (hereafter referred to as the biodiversity indicator score). Constraint set in eqn 2 is the budget constraint preventing the total cost of the selected areas to exceed the available budget (b). Constraint set in eqn 3 is the area constraint, preventing the total selected area from exceeding a certain proportion (q) of the total area. Constraint set in eqn 4 ensures that the area selected from each 50 × 50 km plot and age class is smaller than its existing area, and set in eqn 5 is the non‐negativity constraints on the decision variables.\n\nIt is difficult to establish weights w e that can be considered to be appropriate (Polasky, Camm & Garber‐Yonts 2001). Typically, an indicator with large value will dominate and the solution tends to select areas with high values for one (or maybe a few) indicators. Goal programming is an approach that includes several objectives (expressed as goals) in the same objective function and still allows a trade‐off that is considered impartial. In goal programming, we establish goals in phase 1. In our case, we simply solved the problem [P1] as many times as we had different indicators. When we solved [P1] for indicator e, we set w e to 1 for that indicator and 0 for all other indicator weights. This means that we independently searched for the best possible value for each indicator. We let those 17 values be denoted as z e.\n\nIn the second phase, we wanted to find a solution in which all indicators were as close as possible to their goal. Since it would not be possible to reach the goal of each indicator, a quadratic deviation from these goals was minimized. The goal programming model in phase 2 can be formulated as\n\n(eqn 1b)\n\nsubject to\n\n(eqn 2), (eqn 3), (eqn 4), (eqn 5)\n\nIn this objective function, eqn 1b, the squared difference between the goal and the actual biodiversity indicator score for each indicator is minimized. The difference is scaled with the goal value and hence we measure the deviation as a percentage deviation. Problem [P2] is a quadratic programming problem. The problem is convex (Lundgren, Rönnqvist & Värbrand 2010) so a global optimal solution is guaranteed.\n\nThe models were formulated in the modelling language AMPL and solved using the software CPLEX 11·2 (ILOG 2006). All tests were conducted on a standard PC with 2·99 GHz and 3·25 GB of internal memory. The number of variables (in both models) was 9520 (112*5*17) and the number of constraints was 562 (1 + 1 + 112*5). The solution time for each problem was within a fraction of a second.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe results clearly show that it is more cost‐effective to protect young forests and more area‐effective to protect old forests, but that a combination of age classes always gives the highest biodiversity indicator score. This indicates that all age classes have a value to biodiversity, and that a reserve network ideally should consist of forests of different ages regardless of whether the selection is limited by budget or by area. This is also challenging since it demonstrates that there is a need to reorient current boreal forest conservation strategies, which almost exclusively target the oldest forests.\n\nIt was evident that it is more cost‐effective to use a budget‐constrained model compared to an area‐constrained model when selecting reserves. Previous studies have shown that when land prices vary and area is used as a limitation, more money than necessary is spent, which is unfortunate since conservation is always restricted by scarce resources (Ando et al. 1998; Polasky, Camm & Garber‐Yonts 2001). When using an area‐constrained model the same biodiversity indicator score can be obtained in a smaller total area. Decision makers, therefore, have to integrate ecological and economic data and balance short‐ and long‐term constraints in terms of cost and area in order to design cost‐effective conservation strategies (Polasky, Camm & Garber‐Yonts 2001; Juutinen et al. 2004; Messer 2006; Naidoo et al. 2006).\n\nThe analyses show that if costs are considered, large areas of young forests in north‐western Sweden are selected. There are already numerous large nature reserves in this section of the boreal region, and more than 75% of all protected forests in the country are found here. However, the present reserves are overwhelmingly old, and by setting aside young, structurally rich forests nearby, dispersal and colonization of some species might be facilitated. One risk of concentrating reserves in the northwest region is that rare species confined to more eastern regions would not be protected\n\nWhen costs are not considered, as in the area‐constrained model, old forests are mostly selected and these are primarily located in the south‐eastern section of the study area. One reason for this southern dominance could be a higher productivity, leading to higher representation of large trees, tentatively a subject to be further scrutinized in subsequent studies along with complementarity analyses between our model selections and existing reserves.\n\nThe NFI data showed that a majority of the structure‐based variables of importance to biodiversity are most common in the oldest age classes, but that there are substantial amounts also found in younger forests. For the youngest age class, 0–14 years, this mainly reflects the practice of tree retention, (leaving trees for biodiversity at clear cutting) introduced in Sweden and other countries a few decades ago. However, at least in terms of dead wood the same pattern is also found following natural disturbances such as forest fires or storms, with plenty of dead wood present in the early successional stages, whilst amounts are lower at intermediate ages and then higher again in old‐growth stages (Siitonen 2001). Much of the high conservation values of young forests reported here are thus likely to prevail both in young forests originating from management practices and in those originating from natural disturbances, although the latter would probably host higher amounts of dead wood and large living trees (Uotila et al. 2001).\n\nThe biodiversity indicators chosen were to some extent biassed towards features most common in old‐growth forests (e.g. uneven age, multi‐layered canopy and presence of large trees). A more unbiassed list of indicators would also include those that are important for rare species that prefer young age classes, such as sun‐exposed dead trees (Kaila, Martikainen & Punttila 1997; Jonsell, Weslien & Ehnström 1998). Including a larger proportion of such indicators would further strengthen the result that young forests host important biodiversity potential.\n\nThere are some weaknesses in the structure‐based approach. The same structures can be present in young and old forests, but support different species compositions, mainly due to differences in microclimatic conditions and colonization opportunities. Further, the presence of structures is no guarantee of the presence of associated species since other aspects, such as forest history and connectivity might be decisive for species occurrences (Nilsson, Hedin & Niklasson 2001). Therefore, a further development of our study would be to repeat the analyses for species distribution data and compare the results with those based on structural data. There are detailed data on occurrences of red‐listed species from organism groups such as vascular plants, birds, bryophytes, lichens and fungi in boreal Sweden which could be used for such a comparison.\n\nThe proposed goal programming approach provides impartial and objective weighting. We used the same weighting for analysis of the deviation from the goals, but this can be easily modified if desired. If weights are decided manually, care must be taken since the results can greatly disadvantage some variables ( , ‘Min’ column). We note that the importance of different indicators are indirectly weighted when deciding criteria for points, but those decisions are based on existing knowledge of which features are important for biodiversity. A further development of the model could potentially be to add specific requirements regarding geographical distribution or a minimum amount of different indicators. This, however, needs to be substantiated by high‐quality ecological studies on the critical requirements of different species.\n\nIn northern Europe, with its long history of relatively intense forest use, there are so few old‐growth forests left that areas strongly impacted by humans need to be included when new forests are protected. Consequently, it is vital to prioritize the few high‐quality old‐growth remnants that still exist, although our analyses indicate that it is more cost‐effective to include young forests in reserve networks. The young forests that we propose for protection have a decidedly different character than those normally regenerating after clear‐cutting, even with tree retention. A careful selection will be needed for sites especially rich in dead wood, remnant live trees and other qualities of importance to biodiversity. Protection of young forest allows much more land to be set aside than protection of old‐growth forest, due to lower net present values. A shift towards more protection of young forest might therefore eventually cause a reduction in timber volumes available for forest industry. A novel conservation strategy, and a future research challenge, is to analyse if some reserves with old forests could be systematically replaced by younger forests without causing biodiversity decline at the landscape level. Possibly, such a dynamic reserve scheme could benefit both timber production and biodiversity protection. In general, early‐successional stages are overlooked in forest conservation. Thus, our approach with protection of different age classes has a general interest also for other biomes where biodiversity is adapted to frequent disturbances and where early successional stages are common in natural forest landscapes."
