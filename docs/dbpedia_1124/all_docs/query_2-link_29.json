        "text": "Career Opportunities\n\nThe Master's Programme in Energy Efficient Built Environment will prepare you to be a professional working towards the delivery of energy-efficient solutions for the built environment.\n\nPotential future employers are as follows:\n\nconsultancy firms\n\nhousing companies\n\nleading design and construction firms\n\ngovernment and non-government organisations\n\nWorldwide, there is a growing need for qualified professionals in this field who have a working knowledge of energy efficiency and the carbon footprint assessments of buildings (minimising upfront carbon embodied in building materials, lowering operational energy use, and saving carbon at the end-of-life stage through the reuse of materials). For you as a graduate, this means that you will enjoy great flexibility when it comes to putting your expertise into use within various fields of civil, environmental and construction engineering.\n\nProgramme content focuses on energy-efficiency challenges in both cold and temperate climates. The knowledge and skills you acquire from your studies will make you an attractive candidate within the construction industry in Europe, North America and China. Furthermore, the international character of the programme – in terms of both students and faculty – will not only prepare you to work in an international environment but also enable you to build a worldwide professional network.\n\nIncreasing Job Opportunities\n\nIn the global challenge presented by climate change, governments are increasingly under pressure to transition to renewable energy resources and to improve the energy efficiency of their built environment and thus, to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. While the number of professionals who are prepared to tackle this issue in its complexity is steadily growing, Sweden is leading the way in developing and adopting energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly technologies; studying here can provide you with a competitive advantage in this increasingly global job market.\n\nStudy at the PhD level\n\nYou can also pursue your studies at the doctoral level by taking Dalarna University's doctoral programme in Resource Efficient Built Environment.\n\nStay in Dalarna and look for a job after graduating\n\nYou can apply for a 12-month residence permit to stay in Sweden and look for work after you complete a degree programme of at least 60 credits. International students are encouraged to stay in Dalarna and look for a job after graduating from the Master's Programme in Energy Efficient Built Environment.\n\nUsing your degree overseas\n\nThe degree awarded by Dalarna University for this programme is internationally recognized and has been used by previous students to attain employment or pursue further studies outside of Sweden.\n\nYou can also apply to receive an Erasmus+ grant for an internship, even up to 12 months after completing your studies. This opportunity is available to all students in the programme, regardless of nationality, who pursue an approved internship within an Erasmus+ programme country other than Sweden.\n\nDalarna University is a small university, which means you will readily get to know your classmates and teachers. You will study at Campus Borlänge or online and all classes are designed so that students on campus and online interact with one another.\n\nBorlänge is located two hours north of Stockholm and 20 km from the historic town of Falun, the political centre of the County of Dalarna. Borlänge is characterised by thriving business and industry, and surrounded by the stunning Swedish countryside. Dalarna is hometo such major corporations as SSAB, Hitachi Energy and Clas Ohlsson.\n\nThroughout your studies, you will attend lectures, complete practical exercises and laboratories, work on individual and group projects, participate in seminar discussions, make fields trips, and take exams. Each week, you can expect to have 10 to 20 hours of class time and 30 to 40 hours of study time outside of class.\n\nAbout 10 - 15 students study this programme on campus and an additional 25 - 35 study online. Often our students have different disciplinary backgrounds and are from countries the world over. Such diversity in the classroom allows for a stimulating exchange of knowledge and experience, and not least enriched learning.\n\nSeveral of our courses are interdisciplinary with the Master's Programme in Solar Energy Engineering. This factor serves to increase both networking opportunities and interdisciplinary exchange. The knowledge you gain and the connections you build, both inside and outside the classroom, will help you in your professional endeavours\n\nShe was certain – studies were not for her. Now she is a doctoral student. When she chose to study at Dalarna University, Marieke Rynoson changed the course of her future and what is more, the skills and knowledge she has so far acquired through her studies are in high demand.\n\nFrom northern Germany, Marieke grew up in a family that every summer headed north to Sweden. Huddled in the back seat of the family car, between luggage and her father's parachuting gear, she could hardly have imagined that one day she would call the county of Dalarna in central Sweden her home.\n\nAfter upper-secondary school, Marieke thought her academic life was behind her: she wanted to work with something concrete, something practical. So it was that she began an apprenticeship as a church painter, a job where her interest in historical buildings came into play and where practical work featured strongly. Her curiosity grew for the renovation of old buildings, which then led her to pursue studies in construction engineering. The next thing to happen is that she meets Rikard, a mason, and moves to Säter, a small town in Dalarna.\n\nMarieke Rynoson\n\nAge: 29\n\nBackground: church painter, Bachelor's degree in Construction Engineering, Master's degree in Energy Efficient Built Environment\n\nInterests: Makes her own clothes\n\nCurrent position: Doctoral student in the field of energy efficiency\n\nAt first she wondered what she would do in Sweden and whether she would be able to put her education to good use. She soon found out that Dalarna University at its campus in nearby Borlänge offered a Master’s programme in energy-efficient construction, a perfect match with her previous knowledge as well as her interest in sustainable living.\n\n- It felt like it was meant to be – that I was supposed to end up here just so that I could take this programme, says Marieke.\n\nShe soon found out that returning to student life after several years as a working professional was an easier transition than she might have imagined.\n\n- A small university like Dalarna University really suits me: here you get to know everyone. People treat each other like equals, regardless of whether they’re a professor or a student. We get the sense that our teachers really want to see us be successful.\n\nHer university instructor Jonn Are Myhren nods in agreement.\n\n- We study issues related to a sustainable society, an issue that is always relevant. Our students' knowledge must always be up-to-date, and they need to follow developments as they happen. This is where our research contributes a great deal, says Jonn Are, who is director of the Master's Programme in Energy Efficient Built Environment.\n\nJonn Are and Marieke agree that the development and design of future energy-efficient buildings and homes are together an important social issue, one that many companies have an interest in as well, something that has not gone unnoticed.\n\n- During the programme, we got to make regular visits to companies, which meant students got to meet a number of potential employers. It also meant that all the theory we learned was put into practice. This increased our motivation because it became clear that our skills are in demand, says Marieke.\n\nWhen Marieke had completed her Master’s, she looked forward to working with the analysis of buildings to see how they could be made more energy efficient. She also wanted to combine her interest in old buildings with her new knowledge and skills in a practical way.\n\n- But then one of my teachers asked me if I’d ever considered doing research. \"What, me?\" was my spontaneous response. But that's how it all began, she laughs.\n\nHer teacher had noticed Marieke's commitment and interest during her studies and saw an opportunity for her to acquire even deeper knowledge. Over the four years to come, Marieke will study the integration of solar cells in the energy systems of buildings. What happens after that is something Marieke has yet to give any thought to. However, her interest in old buildings – the former church painter that she is – and her knowledge of how energy efficiency can be created are aspects that she hopes she can apply to her own house one day.\n\n– My studies opened up opportunities I didn't even know I had, she says. Here I am now – somebody who didn’t plan to study at all, and now it's my job – to study! Life can always take you down surprising new paths."
