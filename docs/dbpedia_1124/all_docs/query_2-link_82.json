To me Precision Forestry has not only been a program with the start and end but a bigger vision towards a transformation not only within Stora Enso and forest industry but in societies all over the world. Happy as always to continue on this journey with Jani Kaskinen , Antti Kaartinen, Erik Willén and many others. We all need to know the origin of the raw material of the products we are consuming. Precision Forestry has answer to that. And not only the answer to that but also a solution on how to produce biodiversity positive products by changing the way to treat the forests around the world. #sustainability #naturetech #biodiversity #storaenso\n\n🌲Transforming forest management with Precision Forestry 🌍🛰️ Precision Forestry is revolutionizing the way we manage forests, combining advanced tech, data, and AI to make smarter and more sustainable decisions. As one of the world’s largest private forest owners, here are our 5 ways to enhance forest management with this data-driven approach: 💡Optimized forest machine routes: Using terrain data, we can cut CO2 emissions and protect biodiversity 💡Early detection of forest damage: Satellites and drones spot forest damage like bark beetle exposure fast 💡Efficient mapping: Drones can scan 1,000 hectares per day, improving planning and species mapping 💡Enriched biodiversity data: Combining forest and biodiversity data from various sources, we can manage biodiversity and wood production side-by-side 💡High-quality, traceable data: Science-based frameworks require auditable forest data, and guide our net positive impact on biodiversity. With AI and our digital Precision Forestry platform, we can combine multiple data layers and create an accurate Digital Twin of Forest🌲🌲 This enables us and other forest owners to map, model and manage ecosystems precisely, and at the same time maximize the value of forest assets.

One promising area where AI is making a significant impact is in forest restoration, a critical component in combating climate change. I was thrilled to read that AI is transforming forestry into Smart Forestry in the Netherlands, thanks to innovative initiatives like the Forest Foresight tool. By leveraging remote sensing data from satellite and drone imagery, this cutting-edge technology is revolutionizing forest monitoring and conservation efforts. The Forest Foresight tool enables real-time detection of potential deforestation threats, allowing for timely intervention to protect our precious forests. Its predictive analytics model has proven to be incredibly effective, with an impressive 80% accuracy rate in forecasting forest loss up to six months in advance. Hoping to see such usage of AI where the we can actually impact climate change for good.

From teaching AI to detect smoke rising from timber plantations to scanning bushwalkers' photos to assess fuel loads, the technology is becoming an essential part of protecting the nation's forests. In an Australian first, AI and satellite technology is monitoring the Green Triangle, one of the nation's largest plantation forestry regions, along the South Australian-Victorian border, for bushfires. #australia #bushfires #ai #theglobalbpo Full Story: https://lnkd.in/gpq4am48\n\nClimate change makes forests more vulnerable to invasive species, with insects, pests and disease pathogens threatening tree growth and survival. Climate change is increasing the susceptibility of the world's forests to stressors such as wildfires and pests, according to a new publication by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The Committee on Forestry (COFO), the FAO’s top forestry governing body, was tasked with identifying emerging policy and technical issues, seeking solutions, and advising the FAO on appropriate action. The resulting report reveals the vulnerability of forests worldwide and emphasises the role of innovation in achieving a sustainable future for the forestry sector. https://lnkd.in/gJziQUyA\n\nFarmers think it's cool technology, but struggle to make practical use of imagery. This paper describes a study using uncrewed aerial systems (#UAS) to collect high-resolution #multispectralimagery of #coffee agro-ecosystems in #PuertoRico. The authors created land cover classification maps of the farms using a pixel-based supervised #classification approach. The average overall classification accuracy was 53.9%, which was expected given the high diversity of the landscapes. To understand the utility of the maps for #farmmanagement, the authors interviewed the farmers, showing them the imagery and classification maps. While the farmers were excited about the maps and found them to be a source of pride, they were unsure how to practically apply them to management of their farms. Many farmers had difficulty orienting themselves in the maps and noted that the maps lacked representation of the full biodiversity and crops present. The authors conclude that while the classification accuracies could be improved with refined methodologies, involving the farmers revealed important insights. Farmers appreciated the simplified maps for an introduction, but wanted to see more of their farm diversity represented. The authors argue for more iterations of the classifications that incorporate farmer feedback and local knowledge. Overall, the study highlights the potential of UAS remote sensing for highly diverse agroecosystems, but emphasizes the importance of farmer engagement and co-development of mapping products to maximize their relevance and utility for farm management. Further work is needed to bridge the technology with farmers' needs and perceptions.\n\nExciting advancements in forestry tech! 🌳 Recently, we remotely controlled a forestry machine in a forest outside Västerås, Sweden with limited coverage, using a drone equipped with 5G technology to extend mobile coverage. This test, part of a collaborative project with Mittuniversitetet, Ericsson, Skogforsk, SCA, Volvo CE, and Biometria, demonstrated the power of 5G in transforming remote operations. During the test, the drone created a coverage area extending up to 3 kilometers, allowing the forestry machine to be operated from Skogforsk’s remote control lab in Uppsala, 80 kilometers away. Our goal is to use this technology to improve operational efficiency and safety across various industries, including forestry and agriculture. The project also aims to study the latency and reliability of data communication, crucial for remotely controlling machinery.
