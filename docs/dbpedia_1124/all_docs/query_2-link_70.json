        "text": "I have finally gotten to the point where I need to think about organizing by metadata rather than with my folder structure, as many on this forum recommend. Today I was trying to find the photos of a trip to California that I made with my son. First, I couldn't remember the year, and my system organizes by year. Then, I thought the folder was named \"Trip to California\" but it turned out to be \"California Trip\", so even when I had the right year folder I was looking too far down and missed it!\n\nBut I immediately ran into a problem. Sure, I can keyword photos by where I took them, like Indiana, Nebraska, etc. But how do I structure keywords so that I can easily find ALL the photos from this trip? I thought of using the keyword \"trip\" and \"california\", but that doesn't quite do it - what about the photos in Indiana that I took on this trip? Or I could have a hierarchical structure with \"california\" a sub to \"destination\" or something like that. Seems kludgey, though.\n\nThen I thought about events, like birthdays. When my son John has a birthday I could use the keywords \"John\" and \"birthday\". But there will be photos taken on his birthday that have his sister Megan in them, so that when I try to find photos of Megan's birthday by searching on keywords \"Megan\" and \"birthday\", I'll pick up photos from John's birthday! Not at all what I want. And what about graduations, confirmations, and other events?\n\nSince lots of you seem to be organizing by keyword I am sure there is a simple solution to this. Maybe I am just overthinking it. But I am looking forward to hearing some advice.\n\nThe first point is that keywords are not a substitute for good, systematic organisation of folders. There are two reasons for this. The first you have already discovered; if the folder structure is a mess, keywords will not always get you out of it. The second is that you will very probably access images from a number of applications, and by no means all applications use keywords.\n\nSo I'd actually start by tidying up your folder system. Your organisation by year is a good start. I'd continue that at the next level also. Whatever the folder title may be, prefix it with a sortable date or date range (in the form 20110714 or 110714 for today's date). Most people either know dates (such as family birthdays), or can use them to narrow down the possibilities (\"that must have been in September 2003 or 2004\").\n\nDates are usually best for identifying pictures related to known events. In Lightroom, you could easily create a smart collection covering the dates of your trip, for example. I actually start all file as well as folder names with the date, and I very rarely rename files so that they retain their identity (and therefore traceability) within the data structure.\n\nKeywords are good for finding images of, say, a particular person or place when you don't know (or don't care) the date on which you took them. If you are trying to find \"that picture of Mary by the window\", using the 'Mary' keyword as a filter is an obvious start. Whether you then want to do further filtering, or, say, add particular pictures to a collection, will depend on what you are trying to do.\n\nTo summarise:\n\ngetting the folder organisation right gives you the best start, whatever else you do to organise your images;\n\nthe most effective system will often use several techniques (including keywords) in combination; no one technique will do everything you need.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nDavid\n\nWell, I'm sticking to my guns, but in the friendly spirit of the forum, I hope .\n\nKeywords and other metadata are a complete and superior method of organization, in my opinion, and your folders can be anything at that point, and you will always be able to find your photos.\n\nOf course it depends on what you mean by 'complete' and 'superior'. But I can think of no meaning of those words in the present connection that I could agree with. I think that keywords can only become more than an ancillary tool when, as in a full time professional context, the resources and skills are available to operate a controlled vocabulary in a systematic and disciplined fashion.\n\nThe difficulty for most amateurs (and I hold up my hand too) is that the time and effort required to do keywording properly can seem like an impossible mountain to climb when you come to the task with thousands of existing images to be dealt with. And, as the OP rightly observes, it is really hard to know, beyond rather obvious cases, it is rather difficult to know how to create a keywording system that suits one's particular needs. In short, I believe that, for many if not most users, keywording, though extremely useful in conjunction with other techniques, is too high risk to be regarded as a complete solution. The beautiful example of a controlled vocabulary that erro gave us bespeaks a level of skill that can only be acquired with effort and experience, and the typically rather steep learning curve involved is a risk issue for new users. It is possible to 'buy in' controlled vocabularies, of course, but, having looked several times at that option, I have never found that it met my particular need.\n\nIf you are going to put the energy into keywords and other metadata, then don't waste your time tidying up your folder system, it doesn't buy you anything, because you can use keywords and other metadata. Let Lightroom do the hard work of remembering where you photos are stored, so you don't have to.\n\nActually, I'd turn this argument pretty much on its head. Somewhat obviously, keywords are pointers to data, not containers for it. The storage of the data is handled by the file system, and any sensible data handling (including, of course, archiving and backup as well as retrieval) will require an organised file system. The writers of Lightroom have recognised this, and have provided for it. So getting the file/folder organisation right is needed in any case. If, when you do that, the system you adopt helps you to find images (as my date-based system certainly does for me), that added benefit comes at no extra cost. So I still believe that getting the file system right should, for many people (including the OP as he describes his situation), come logically before an all out assault on the keywording task. I would however advise those same people to add at least basic keywords to any images they import from now on, as that will make full-scale keywording that much easier later. And that is also what I do, though, as it happens, I don't use Lightroom for the job.\n\nThe original poster apparently had done this with his folders, and it didn't help.\n\nWell, he can speak for himself, but that's not at all how I read his posts. As he describes it, he started with year-based folders at the high level, but then had no consistent system for storing sub-folders within those year folders. My point was that consistency throughout the file/folder system (which, if done on download, can be achieved at little or no cost) makes it easier to find and manage files. As I experience this benefit on a daily basis, it would be rather hard to convince me that it is not real.\n\nThe main point is that different people will need to use different techniques (in different combinations) to meet their different needs. And, the more one can reduce the perceived cost and complexity of the various techniques, the more useful they are likely to be. What worried me about your post was the use of the words 'superior' and 'complete' in combination: it came across, if I may say so, as rather more dogmatic than I would ever like to be in advising another user. Perhaps that was also a fault of my own post; if so, I beg your and the OP's pardon. The one point we can surely agree on is that we are here to help each other.\n\nDavid\n\nThe beautiful example of a controlled vocabulary that erro gave us bespeaks a level of skill that can only be acquired with effort and experience, and the typically rather steep learning curve involved is a risk issue for new users. It is possible to 'buy in' controlled vocabularies, of course, but, having looked several times at that option, I have never found that it met my particular need.\n\nWell, thanks, I guess....\n\nI am just an amateur hobby photographer myself. My keyword list and hierarchy is something I have come up with myself over the years.\n\nWARNING: Long text ahead!!!\n\nI started organizing my photos just using folders and filenames in Windows explorer, but as time went I realized I needed something better. I started googling and reading about image organization, DAM and lots of things. In the end I decided for Lightroom, and I haven't regretted that choice.\n\nSo, to start with I had maybe 20.000 images without keywords, stored in folders by year and month. I soon decided that I would use LR's built-in import storing facility to instead use YYYY\\MM\\DD. I probably could just as well have sticked to my YYYY\\MM structure, but I decided to add the \\DD also. Doesn't really matter.\n\nThen I set out on the keywording journey. A journey that is not finished yet. And maybe it will never be 100% finished. But I make small stops along the way all the time, finishing small parts. That's where hierarchies and smart collections help me.\n\nTo start with I used a flat keywords structure. I soon realized this was not very efficient. If nothing else, the keyword listy becomes hard to manage when there are hundreds or thousands of keywords in a long list. So, time to start some hierarchies. At the same time I came across \"the 5 W's\":\n\n- who?\n\n- what?\n\n- where?\n\n- when?\n\n- why?\n\nThe 5 W's are used by some journalists to summarize what is important in a story or a photo. They want to describe the who, what, where, when and why of something. This idea appealed to me so I started my hierarchy based on that. When is already taken care of by EXIF placing date and time in the metadata automatically. Now I just needed four top-level \"categories\":\n\n- people (the who: who is in the photo?)\n\n- subject (the what: what is the photo of? What is the motif/subject?)\n\n- location (the where: where is the photo taken?)\n\n- reason (the why: why is the photo taken?)\n\nSo far I have started populating the people and location categories. I'm not fully done yet, but almost there. I haven't even started on the subject and reason categories (mainly because thay are harder to describe).\n\nThe people hierarchy started of as a flat hierarchy under the main \"people\" keyword. I soon realized this would be far too many people in one huge list, so I quickly started using sub-categories:\n\n- people\n\n- my family\n\n- - person A\n\n- - person B\n\n- my wifes family\n\n- - person A\n\n- - person B\n\n- collegues\n\n- - person A\n\n- - person B\n\n- friends\n\n- - person A\n\n- - person B\n\netc......\n\nAs a side-effect this allows me to quickly view all photos with anyone from my wifes family for example.\n\nThe location hierarchy actually started out not as a hierarchy. To begin with I used the IPTC location fields: Country, State, City, Sublocation. But I soon realized that it was a lot of double work having to type text in four fields for every location. Quadruple work actually. So I switched over to a keyword hierarchy instead using this structure:\n\n- location\n\n- - continent\n\n- - - country\n\n- - - - county\n\n- - - - - municipality\n\n- - - - - - city\n\n- - - - - - - part of city\n\n- - - - - - - - even more detailed location if necessary\n\nThe degree of detail levels depend on how many photos from each location I have. The more photos, the more detailed.\n\nThe switchover from IPTC location to keyword location was fairly simple as I could filter for different places in IPTC and batch assign them the proper keywords. Now I have a hierarchy like this:\n\n- location\n\n- - Asia\n\n- - - Malaysia\n\n- - - - Kuala Lumpur\n\n- - - - - city center\n\n- - - - - airport\n\n- - - - Langkawi\n\n- - - - - Kuah\n\n- - - - - - city center\n\n- - - - - - harbour\n\n- - - - - Tanjung Rhu\n\n- - - - - - beach\n\n- - - - - - mangrove swamp\n\n- - - Thailand\n\n- - - - Bangkok\n\n- - - - - Bang rak\n\n- - - - - - Sathon pier\n\n- - - - - Chatuchak\n\n- - - - - - weekend market\n\n- - - - - Silom\n\n- - - - - - hotel Tawana\n\n- - - - Krabi province\n\n- - - - - Koh Lanta\n\n- - - - - Krabi\n\n- - - - - - Ao nang\n\n- - - - - - - beach\n\n- - - - - - - village\n\n- - - - - - Koh poda\n\n- - - - - - Krabi town\n\n- - Europe\n\n- - - France\n\n- - - - Paris\n\n- - - - - 1er arrondissement\n\n- - - - - - Ile de la cité\n\n- - - - - - Louvre\n\n- - - - - 5eme arrondissement\n\n- - - - - - Quartier latin\n\n- - - - - 6eme arrondissement\n\n- - - - - - Jardin de Luxembourg\n\n- - - Iceland\n\n- - - - Blue lagoon\n\n- - - - Geysir\n\n- - - - Hraunfossar\n\n- - - - Reykjavik\n\n- - - - - city center\n\n- - - - - airport\n\n- - - - Skogafoss\n\n- - - - Thingvellir\n\n- - - Sweden\n\n- - - - Dalarna county\n\n- - - - - Avesta municipality\n\n- - - - - - Avesta town\n\n- - - - - Ludvika municipality\n\n- - - - - - Fredriksberg town\n\n- - - - - - Ludvika town\n\n- - - - - - - city center\n\n- - - - - - - Gatefall\n\n- - - - - - - Highmountain\n\n- - - - Kalmar county\n\n- - - - - Emmaboda municipality\n\n- - - - - - Boda town\n\n- - - - - - Johansfors\n\n- - - - - Nybro municipality\n\n- - - - - - Nybro\n\n- - - - - - - city center\n\n- - - - - - Orrefors\n\n- - - - - - - glassworks\n\n... and so on ...\n\nThe initial setup of the hierarchy took some time of course. But I did it bit by bit, as needed.\n\nThe \"beauty\" of all this comes when I mix it with smart collections. The main categories are actually named:\n\n- ¤location\n\n- ¤people\n\nI have two smart collections searching for photos that are missing those keywords. If I haven't assigned any location, that photo will not have the ¤location keyword. I use the ¤-symbol to indicate a \"category\" as opposed to a \"proper\" keyword. This makes it possible for me to assign location and people at will, to any photo, at any time, while still keeping track of things.\n\nLocation is fairly simple since any photo can have only one location. People on the other hand.... A photo can include many people, only one person, no persons at all, and perhaps unknown persons. I have cared for those as well:\n\n- ¤people\n\n- - _no-one\n\n- - _unknown\n\n- - - my family\n\n- - - my wifes family\n\n... and so on ....\n\nThe two special cases no-one and unknown also get tags, in order to allow me to keep track of things. I can't just NOT tag a photo where there are no people. Then it would appear as if I haven't evaluated that photo with regards to people. By tagging it with no-one I will know that there is in fact no people in the photo, and it won't show up in my smart collection looking for photos untagged for people (keywords doesn't contain ¤people).\n\nAs I said, I haven't even started looking into tagging the \"what\" and \"why\" of the photos. But when I do that, I will surely use hierarchies in the same way, with smart collections allowing me to keep track of what I've done and not done.\n\nPhew.... that was a bunch of text. Hopefully someone will get something out of it?"
