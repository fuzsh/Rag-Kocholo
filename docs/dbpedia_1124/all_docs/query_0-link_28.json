As Scandinavia’s largest country, it covers a vast range of landscapes, from rolling fields backed by glorious sandy beaches in the south, to dense pine forest and rocky mountains in the north. All over the country\n\nStortorget’s bustling café life in medieval Gamla Stan\n\nSTOCKHOLM • • • •\n\nMedieval Gamla Stan Vasamuseet Old-time Skansen Stunning archipelago\n\nThe Swedish capital, Stockholm, is one of the most delightful cities in Europe. Draped leisurely across 14 islands, it is an instantly likeable blend of medieval beauty set on water. The heart of the city is the old town, Gamla Stan (see pp49–61), a glorious jumble of narrow cobbled lanes and alleyways with some splendid Baroque architecture. The city’s top attraction, the Vasamuseet (see pp90–91), is a perfectly preserved 17thcentury warship which sank on her maiden voyage in Stockholm harbour. Downtown Stockholm is predominantly modern in appearance, but there is a taste of old Sweden at Skansen (see p92), an\n\nBoathouse, Bohuslän, Western Gotaland\n\nare charming towns and cities bursting with fascinating museums and great restaurants. To get the most out of a visit to Sweden, it is important to decide where to focus your visit. These pages offer a taste of what each region has to offer.\n\noutdoor museum with timber farmhouses and barns from across the country that provide a glimpse from generations back. In the summer actors dress in costume and give demonstrations of how country folk used to live. While in Stockholm, try to get out onto the water. Just beyond the outer reaches of the harbour, there are 24,000 islands waiting to be discovered in the archipelago (see p110–11). Regular boat departures head into a world of islands and skerries topped by pine forest, where visitors can relax in the sunshine, enjoy a picnic in the forest or take a stroll down quiet country lanes edged by wild roses. EASTERN SVEALAND • • • •\n\nBustling Uppsala Medieval Sigtuna Viking-age Birka Majestic Gripsholms Slott\n\nOne of the great things about the attractions of Eastern Svealand is that they are all\n\nwithin easy distance of Stockholm. The scenery here is dominated by Lake Mälaren which makes a pleasant backdrop to many journeys. Uppsala (see pp128–9) has a magnificent cathedral, and its many students give the place the feel of a Swedish Oxford. Much smaller and more picturesque is Sigtuna (see p130), with its rows of neat wooden houses. In summer this quaint little town can be swamped by tourists, all drawn to the impressive medieval ruins of three churches. There’s a wonderful boat trip to Birka (see pp130–31), which sits imposingly upon an island in Lake Mälaren, and takes the prize for Sweden’s oldest town. This is the place to learn about Sweden’s stirring Viking heritage, as it is rich with archaelogical remains. If the imposing façade of Gripsholms Slott (see p134) looks familiar, it’s because it features on the cover of ABBA’s Waterloo album. Inside is one of Sweden’s most engaging castles, full of Gustavian flourishes.\n\nCanoeists paddling in Lake Mälaran by Gripsholms Slott\n\nWall-hanging depicting The Wedding in Cana and Jesus’s Entry into Jerusalem, 1781\n\nD I S C O V E R I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nEASTERN GOTALAND • • • •\n\nVadstena Abbey Kolmårdens Djurpark Lake-side Gränna Kingdom of Crystal\n\nThis region is off-the-beatentrack Sweden. Eastern Götaland sees far fewer tourists than other areas, despite being home to one of the country’s most historic towns. Vadstena (see p145), with its double attractions of castle and medieval abbey, makes a good stop if heading south from Stockholm. It is a particularly pleasant spot in summer when the narrow, cobbled streets are bedecked with flowers.\n\nCoffin which transported the holy Saint Bridget, Vadstena Abbey\n\nSweden is not associated with wild animals such as lions and crocodiles, but that’s exactly what’s waiting at Kolmårdens Djurpark (see p144); this safari park comes complete with dolphinarium, tropicarium and ape house. Gränna (see p150) is a low-key lake-side resort on the banks of the country’s second largest lake, Vättern. It is a favourite with Swedes, who come here to enjoy the fantastic vistas and to sample the town’s famous sweet peppermint flavoured rock. Admirers of glassware will want to visit the Kingdom of Crystal (see pp152–3) in Sweden’s deep south, where names like Kosta Boda and Orrefors have both sales outlets and production sites.\n\nThe unusual raukar (limestone stacks) off Gotland’s northwest coast\n\nGOTLAND • • • •\n\nBeautiful beaches Unspoilt Visby Fantastic cycling Medieval churches\n\nThe island of Gotland’s main draw is golden, sandy beaches, which compare favourably with those of the Mediterranean. At the heart of Gotland is Visby (see pp163–7), Sweden’s best preserved medieval city, ringed by walls and dominated at its cobbled heart by the impressive ruins of Sankta Karin’s church. Leave Visby and the island’s charms unfold: rolling green countryside, quiet country lands edged by pine forest and charming fishing villages. One of the best ways to get around is to cycle since the island is predominantly flat. Along the way is another attraction – perfectly intact medieval churches standing proud against the backdrop of the Baltic Sea.\n\nthe scenery here is altogether more pastoral: undulating fields of bright yellow rapeseed backed by the deep blue of the Baltic Sea give Southern Götaland its distinctive character. There’s a sophistication in the people, too, who enjoy sipping a cappuccino in an outdoor café and watching the world go by. If there is one place that embodies this southern joie de vivre, it is handsome Lund (see p177), a lively student city, whose impressive cathedral is the envy of the nation. Both Lund and Sweden’s third city, Malmö (see pp178–81), are great places to sample top-notch Swedish cuisine. This part of the country is renowned for its picture postcard coastlines. Alternatively, some of the country’s best Baroque architecture is to be found at the heart of the city of Karlskrona (see pp188–9) with its rich maritime tradition.\n\nSOUTHERN GOTALAND • Lund cathedral • Gourmet eating in Lund and Malmö • Karlskrona’s Baroque architecture\n\nThe southern provinces are Sweden at its most continental. Forget the pine forests and reindeer of the north,\n\nThe Baroque Fredrikskyrkan (see p188) on Stortorget, Karlskrona\n\n9\n\n10\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nGOTHENBURG • Great views from GötheborgsUtkiken • World-class amusement park, Liseberg • Quaint Haga district • Feskekörka fish market\n\nWith canals criss-crossing the city, Gothenburg bears more than a passing resemblance to its Dutch cousin, Amsterdam, and could not be more different from Stockholm. Whereas the capital is grand and imposing, Gothenburg, Sweden’s second city, feels altogether warmer and more welcoming. There is nowhere better to get a bird’s eye view of Scandinavia’s largest port than from the top of the bold red-and-white skyscraper\n\nWooden cottage by the tranquil waters of Strömstad, Western Götaland\n\nvisitors are spoilt for choice at the Feskekôrka fish market (see p201) where there are two excellent restaurants at which to sample the wares.\n\nGötheborgsUtkiken\n\nWESTERN GOTALAND • • • •\n\nIsland retreats Picturesque coastal villages Varberg fortress Laholm’s sandy beaches\n\nrepelling the Danish enemy, marks the beginning of the coast’s sandy beaches, which are best enjoyed at Laholm (see p227). Sea temperatures here in summer are really quite respectable, making swimming off this part of the Swedish coast a real pleasure. The beaches not only stretch for miles, but they are also clothing-optional. WESTERN SVEALAND\n\nThe tram from Central Station to Liseberg amusement park\n\n(see p196). Gothenburgers are justifiably proud of their city and delighted, too, that the Liseberg amusement park (see p200) is acclaimed as Sweden’s most popular tourist attraction, boasting the very latest stomach-churning rides and entertainment. The Haga district (see p201), with its narrow pedestrianized streets and craft stores is a quiet contrast to the bustle of the city centre. There is no greater pleasure here than browsing in the various stores and stopping to enjoy a coffee and a piece of apple and cinnamon pie. For something different,\n\nIt is the dramatic coastline of this part of Sweden that makes a visit to Western Götaland appealing. If planning a visit to nearby Gothenburg, it’s an easy journey north. From smooth granite rocks ideal for sunbathing to sweeping bays of golden sands, there is sure to be a part of this popular coast to please. The Koster islands (see p211) are found off the shores of Strömstad to the north and are perfect for long carefree days, either lazing in the sun or exploring by bicycle. The coastline south of this area is renowned for its picturesque villages. Perhaps the most charming is modest Fjällbacka (see p212–3), whose narrow streets and wooden houses huddle around the harbour, which was once home to a vast herring fleet. Today, the town is popular for swimming and boating. The pleasant seaside town of Varberg (see p226) with its fortress, once used for\n\n• • • •\n\nRolling lakeland countryside Örebro Slott Folklore villages Fascinating bear park\n\nFor Swedes, Western Svealand is the most quintessentially Swedish part of the country: rolling hills, pastoral farmland and charming villages of typical wooden homes with red\n\nThe 13th-century Örebro Slott on the River Svartån\n\nD I S C O V E R I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\n11\n\nside: endless pine forests, remote mountain villages and highland pastures used for reindeer herding by the country’s indigenous people, the Sámi.

Sweden to have a go and the Kungsleden Trail (see p274–5) is Sweden’s longest hiking path at over 400 km (248 miles) long. Arvidsjaur (see p273) is an excellent spot to get to grips with the history of the indigenous Sámi people, who have tended their reindeer in these parts of Swedish Lapland for centuries.

This region is also dominated by water – there are lakes seemingly everywhere, including Sweden’s largest lake, Vänern. Take a tour of the Fryken lakes (see p232), north of Karlstad, to pass through some stunning lakeland countryside once home to Sweden’s Nobel laureate and favourite children’s author, Selma Lagerlöf (see p233). Water is also a key feature in Örebro, an engaging city between Karlstad and Stockholm. The 13th-century Örebro Slott (see p238) sits proudly on an island in the River Svartån which flows right through the heart of the city. The north of the region around Lake Siljan is characterized by quaint villages and undulating farmland where Sweden’s rich folklore (see pp240–41) is still alive today. At Midsummer people don traditional dress and dance around the Maypole. Nearby, the interesting Orsa Grönklitt bear park (see p244) offers visitors a chance to come face to face with the king of the forest, as well as wolves, lynx and wolverine.\n\n12\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nc Ar\n\nPutting Sweden on the Map\n\nC tic irc\n\nle\n\nThe kingdom of Sweden is one of the largest countries in Europe, covering 449,964 sq km (173,730 sq miles). The most southerly point, Smygehuk, lies at about the same latitude as Edinburgh in Scotland, and the northernmost tip, Treriksröset, is nearly 300 km (186 miles) north of the Arctic Circle. As the crow flies, Sweden is 1,572 km (977 miles) from south to north – the same distance as from Smygehuk to Rome. Sweden shares land borders with Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and water borders with Germany, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and Denmark, which lies across the Kattegat.

As a nation, Sweden has built its wealth on its natural resources and the ingenuity of its engineers. It has a heritage rich in music, literature and folk traditions and its people have a deep-rooted sense of peace and democracy. Few nations in Europe offer such an exceptionally diverse landscape, rich in flora and fauna, as Elk Sweden. From north of the Arctic Circle the country stretches a lengthy 1,572 km (977 miles) south, a distance equal to almost half the length of Europe. The extreme north is the land of the midnight sun, where daylight lasts for 24 hours in high summer, but is almost non-existent in midwinter. Moving southwards, the forests and wetlands of Norrland provide habitats for large numbers of elk and a thriving birdlife. In the far south, the rolling plains of Skåne and the area around the great lakes make good arable land.\n\nTo the east, the green islands of the Stockholm archipelago contrast with the bare rocky outline of the west coast. A COUNTRY SHAPED BY ICE\n\nThe mountain chain which runs along part of Sweden’s border with northern Norway has several peaks more than 2,000 m (6,500 ft) high. It was formed when the ice which covered the country until 10,000 years ago retreated northwards. Several glaciers from this time still linger in the north. THE CLIMATE\n\nSweden has a relatively mild climate for its northerly location. However, because of the length of the\n\nStart of the annual Vasaloppet race, which attracts more than 16,000 skiers\n\nCrown Princess Victoria and Princess Madeleine in national costume on Swedish Flag Day\n\n16\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nlives in the cities and less than 2 per cent is employed in agriculture. In the post-war period the need for labour led to immigration. Flows of immigrants became even greater at the end of the 20th century with the arrival of refugees from the world’s trouble spots.

The environment is a key issue. Swedes have a deep-rooted love of nature, enshrined in the Right to Roam, which guarantees free access to the forests and countryside and the right to pick berries and mushrooms. There is widespread support for combating pollution. LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS\n\nWhile Swedish is the dominant language, Finnish, Tornedalsfinska (the dialect of Finnish spoken in the Torne Valley) and Sami are all official minority languages. The largest of these is Finnish with around 20,000 speakers, while Sami is spoken by about 10,000 people. Despite the general use of standard Swedish, dialects also flourish. The majority is multilingual and Swedes in general are often fluent in English.\n\nBerry- and mushroom-picking in rural areas, with permission under Sweden’s Right to Roam\n\nA SPORTING NATION\n\nSweden’s abundance of clean, unpolluted waters makes fishing a popular hobby, and the long coastline, glorious archipelagos and numerous waterways have made it a nation of sailors.

Its own Dag Hammarskjöld was a celebrated Secretary-General (1953–61), and Swedish troops have been involved Ideal conditions for Sweden’s sailing enthusiasts in peace initiatives worldwide. in sheltered archipelagos\n\n18\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nLandscape and Wildlife Sweden has a remarkably varied landscape. The flat arable land of Skåne in the south gives way to lakes and forests, rugged mountains, fast-flowing rivers and wild open moorland further north, leading to the Arctic tundra. Plant and animal species from both continental Europe and the Arctic thrive. Large areas of wilderness have become enclaves where endangered species such as bears and wolves, snakes and owls have been able to survive the pressure from civilization. The coastline, too, is immensely varied. Marine life is unique, as North Sea fish make their way into the brackish water of the Baltic and mix with species normally only found in fresh water.\n\nCOASTS AND ISLANDS Smooth rocks and sandy beaches dominate the west coast, where marine life includes saltwater fish such as cod and haddock. Freshwater pike and whitefish can be found off the northerly stretches of the east coast. On the limestone islands of Öland and Gotland orchid meadows flourish. Seals declined in\n\nnumber as a result of hunting, pollution and disease. But now populations of grey seals, ringed seals and harbour seals (pictured) are increasing, thanks to their protected status. Sea eagles, with a wing span of up to 250 cm (8 ft), are Sweden’s largest birds of prey. They nest along the east coast and also on lakes in Lappland.\n\nWolves are a threatened species\n\nand, despite migration from neighbouring countries, there are only around 200 in Sweden.\n\nTHE ARABLE SOUTH The flat lands of Skåne with their fields of crops, willow windbreaks and half-timbered houses topped by storks’ nests are a familiar image of Sweden. But just as typical are the stony pastures and juniper slopes of Småland surrounding red cottages, and the meadows and pasture lands of Mälardalen. Roe deer were almost extinct in the early 19th century. Now they are so common in southern and central Sweden that they are known to raid local gardens in search of food.

There are more than 2,000 species of flowers alone. After a long cold winter, nature explodes into life with a profusion of blooms, as in the orchid meadows of Öland. Swedes’ love of wild flowers is illustrated by the maypoles and garlands used to celebrate Midsummer. Wood anemones\n\nThe red waterlily can only\n\ncarpeting the forests signal the arrival of spring.\n\nbe found in some lakes in Tiveden National Park.\n\nFORESTS More than half of Sweden’s land area is covered by forests, with deciduous trees in the south, coniferous forests with pines and spruce further north. Here lingonberries, blueberries and chanterelles grow. This is the home of elk and beaver, and forest birds such as capercaillies and black grouse. The elk is the big game\n\nKing Karl’s Spire can grow 1 m (3 ft) tall – an impressive height for an orchid. It is most common in swampy mountain areas.\n\nTHE FAR NORTH The mountains and moorlands are characterized by their proximity to the Arctic. With late spring come the migratory birds such as hooper swans and the lesser whitefronted goose, and the mountain flora bursts into flower. Wolves, bears, wolverine and lynx inhabit the national parks. Reindeer live as domesticated animals in northern Sweden, farmed by Sami in the mountains and forests. In winter the herds move further south to graze.\n\nof the forest. Around 100,000 elk are killed in the annual hunting season and, despite the road warning signs, others die in accidents involving cars.\n\nThe brown bear is the largest of Sweden’s predators and can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb). It may look slow, but it moves quickly and is dangerous if disturbed.\n\nThe ptarmigan lives above the tree line and is often encountered, as it is unafraid of mountain hikers. It follows the changing seasons with up to four changes of plumage.\n\n20\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nSweden’s Wooden Houses The quintessential image of Sweden is the red-and-white painted wooden cottage. Originally, wooden houses were not considered attractive so they were painted red to make them look as though they were built of brick, or yellow to represent stone, and this tradition has continued. Every building from the humblest hut to the most majestic mansion was made of timber from the large tracts of forest. Wood triumphs in the grandiose manor houses of Hälsingland and the decoratively carved merchants’ homes Bell Tower of the Stockholm Archipelago.

In the 1790s, it was given a yellow plaster façade and large windows in line with Gustavian style. More recently it was moved to the museum at Skansen. The façade is clad in pine and painted with a copper-vitriol paint, known as Falu red, to prevent rotting.\n\nSwedenborg’s Pavilion The miniature manor house of philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). It is now at Skansen (see p92).\n\nSocietetshuset Decorative wooden buildings, such as this club house for wealthy visitors to the seaside town of Marstrand (see p216), were a feature of the fashionable west coast bathing resorts in the late 19th century.\n\nHALSINGLAND’S MANOR HOUSES Reaping the benefits from the lucrative 19th-century timber industry, the forestowning farmers of Hälsingland built themselves extravagant manor houses. The size of house and magnificence of the painted portico reflected the owner’s wealth and status. The interiors were often decorated with wall paintings.\n\nA\n\nP O R T R A I T\n\nO F\n\nS W E D E N\n\nWooden Lighthouse Dating from 1840, the wooden lighthouse at Bönan also served as a pilot station. It marked the shipping route into Gävle. The building is now a museum. Modern Wooden Architecture The Nordic Watercolour Museum in Skärhamn on the west coast opened in 2000. The Danish architects Bruun/Corfitsen have clad the building’s steel and concrete shell with vertical wooden panels in red, using this traditional material in a public setting. Two-storey houses are common in Hälsingland. The finest have an attic floor with half-windows.\n\nMerchant’s House in the Archipelago In the late 19th century Stockholm’s upper middle classes spent their summers in the archipelago, where they built magnificent wooden villas with verandas, summer houses, bathing huts and boat houses. Foundations\n\nare a course of cobblestones. Porticoes and outer doors are particularly richly ornamented and painted. Other details include turned pillars, intricate woodcarving and elegant roofs.

Much of the formerly rigid etiquette has been relaxed and today Swedes are more informal when it comes to dress and manners. However, despite this culture shift, Swedes still hold onto their roots, local customs, history and traditions. They are passionate about their little red cottages, the Folk countryside, eating herring at Midsummer musician and enjoying the first fresh strawberries.\n\nFEASTS AND FESTIVITIES Celebrating the high points of the year within the family has again become increasingly important, after a dismissive attitude towards tradition in the 1960s and 70s. Many traditions have pagan origins, most of them related to the coming and going of seasons, and are an excuse to eat special treats and play games. The most important is Midsummer, the summer solstice feast. Along with dancing and games around the maypole, the light, short night (when all sorts of magic is in the air) can be marked by watching the sun set and rise a few hours apart (or hardly at all in the north). For those who go to bed it is the custom to pick seven different flowers in silence and place them under their pillow; their future partner will appear in their dreams. Walpurgis night, 30 April, is when the last day of winter is chased away with\n\nhuge bonfires, and songs and speeches welcome spring. Lucia Day, in December, is an intricate mix of pagan and Christian, a festival of light at the onslaught of darkness, which has adopted a Christian martyr as its symbol of hope and bringer of light. Every school, office and church has a Lucia, a girl dressed in white with a red ribbon around her waist symbolizing the martyr’s blood, and a crown of candles on her head (see p29). Easter also has elements of old folk beliefs. Maundy Thursday is the day witches fly to Blåkulla (see p154) to dance with the devil. Today, children dress up, broomsticks and all, and give handmade Easter greetings cards in exchange for sweets. Christmas is preceded by the hectic run-up of Advent, when Swedes go partying and consume vast quantities of glögg (mulled wine usually mixed with cognac or vodka), lussebullar (saffron buns) and pepparkakor (ginger snaps).\n\nSami in traditional costume for a celebratory occasion\n\nDRESS AND ETIQUETTE Those who own a folk costume take it out for midsummer, folk dances, weddings and other formal occasions. Each region has its own historic style and there is also a national dress (see p14). The Sami have their own elaborate costumes. At weddings people are expected to dress up, as specified on the invitation (white tie, black tie or suit). In everyday life, style is more casual, especially in summer. Although Swedes are more easy-going these days, they are still fond of etiquette. It is important to know how to “skål”. Swedes first raise their glass to their female partner at the table, and then to the hostess. People look each other in the eye while raising their glass and saying “skål”, looking down as they drink and then re-establishing eye contact before putting down their glass. If the skål is communal, everyone has to look each person around the table in the eye before drinking. Despite this interest in etiquette, Swedes tend not to observe minor courtesies such as holding open doors or apologizing when they bump into someone. They are very informal when addressing one another; everyone is on first name terms from the start, even when doing business. SINGERS AND MUSICIANS\n\nMidsummer celebrations with games and dancing round the maypole\n\nMore than half a million Swedes sing in a choir, and their passion for song is reflected not just in singing\n\nA\n\nat parties and the everincreasing repertoire of drinking songs, but also in the popularity of singing together. There are few 50th birthday parties where each plate doesn’t come with a songbook or where friends don’t perform songs they have written themselves. Everyone is expected to know works by troubadour Carl Bellman and ballads by Evert Taube (see p60). Folk music is played at clubs and there are festivals dedicated to folk instruments such as the accordion and hurdy-gurdy. Pageants and history plays have also seen a huge upturn in popularity in recent years. CLOSE TO NATURE The Swedes’ love of nature is deeply rooted. Many feel, subconsciously, an almost spiritual affinity with the forest, mountains or the sea. Legends and folklore are often linked to nature and many mythical beings are part of country lore. Trolls dwell in the forest, as does the Skogsrå or Huldra (siren), a beautiful young woman who lures men deeper and deeper into the woods and then, once they are lost, she turns around and all there is to be seen is a hollow tree. Women who stroll too far might hear a lovely tune drifting among the trees – that is Näcken, a handsome naked man, playing his fiddle in the middle of gushing streams\n\nPainting depicting mythical beings in the forest\n\nP O R T R A I T\n\nO F\n\nS W E D E N\n\n23\n\nA tournament during Medieval Week, a popular pageant in Visby\n\nbrief summer which makes and, needless to say, it is having a holiday house in the best to stay away from him. countryside or out on an Giants and dwarfs roam the mountains while elves dance island such a major ambition.

The nation’s design tradition is characterized by simplicity and functionality, with a major emphasis on natural materials. Swedish designers and architects are renowned for creating simple, attractive, “human” objects for everyday use. The 20th century marked the beginning of a new golden age, in which Swedish Stoneware, Hans Hedberg design has won worldwide acclaim.

By the 17th century, Sweden, in its Age of Greatness, ruled supreme over the Baltic region. Vanquished by Russia in 1809, the country adopted a more peaceful role and today is heavily engaged in world affairs.\n\nIn the last 100,000 years, Sweden and midnight sun.

In 1289 it was described as the largest town in Sweden, but it was not yet a capital city. Its importance lay in its role as a trading centre, particularly for the German Hanseatic League, during the 14th century. The Hanseatic League had previously established a base in Visby on Gotland, which was one of its most important centres. In some places, the Hansa influence was so great that the king had to prevent Germans from holding more than half of the leading positions in the town.

Valdemar was replaced after a revolt by his brother Magnus Ladulås who was elected king in 1275. During Magnus’s reign, Swedish legislation was reformed and the Ordinance of Alsnö of 1280 granted the nobility and church far-reaching privileges and freedom from taxation. The king’s nickname, Ladulås (literally “lock barn”), is said to derive from his ban on nobles from helping themselves to sustenance from peasants’ barns when travelling. On Magnus’ death in 1290, his son Birger was still a minor and Sweden was ruled by a regency. Once the king reached his majority in 1303, a power struggle broke out between Birger and his brothers, Dukes Erik and Valdemar. Sweden was divided between the brothers until in 1317 Birger invited Erik and Valdemar to a banquet at Nyköping Castle and had them both imprisoned and left to die. Soon, Birger himself was forced to flee the country after a revolt and Magnus Eriksson, the three year-old son of Duke Erik, was elected king of Sweden in 1319. Magnus’s rule was characterized by severe domestic opposition and financial problems. Sweden also suffered the Black Death in 1350 in which onethird of the population died. The crisis led to the Swedish nobles in 1363 appealing to the Duke of Mecklenburg, whose son Albrecht was hailed king of Sweden the following year.

At a meeting in Kalmar in 1397, Margareta’s nephew, Erik of Pomerania, was crowned king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, thus establishing the Kalmar Union, which lasted until 1523. The unification period was characterized by conflict in Sweden. Under Erik of Pomerania there was great dissatisfaction with newly-introduced taxes. A peasant revolt, known as the Engelbrekt revolt after its legendary leader, led to Erik being deposed in 1439. The Kalmar Union was unable to control the Council of State or the castles, and Sweden lacked a recognized supreme authority. Subsequent Danish kings were recognized as rulers in Sweden only for a few years and in between the country was controlled by representatives of the nobility. At the Battle of Brunkeberg in Stockholm in 1471, the Danish King Christian I sought to enforce his power in Sweden, but was defeated by the viceroy, Sten Sture the Elder. A new Danish crusade under Christian II in 1520 culminated in the notorious Stockholm Bloodbath in which 100 Swedish nobles were executed.\n\n1364 Albrecht of Mecklenburg elected king of Queen Sweden Margareta\n\n1280 Ordinance\n\nof Alsnö grants freedom from taxation to the nobility\n\nO F\n\n1400 1397 The Kalmar\n\nUnion unites the Nordic countries under Queen Margareta\n\n1434 Engelbrekt leads revolt over the taxes and burdens imposed by the Kalmar Union\n\n1450 1471 Sten\n\n1520 Swedish\n\nSture the Elder defeats Danish King Christian I at Brunkeberg\n\nnobles executed in the Stockholm Bloodbath\n\n34\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nGustav Vasa making his ceremonial entry into Stockholm, Midsummer Day, 1523\n\nTHE VASA ERA order to concentrate central power in Among the nobles fortunate to avoid Stockholm.

In 1630 Gustav II Adolf, with his influential chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, decided to intervene in the Thirty Years War (see p36), first on the side of the Protestants, then in an alliance with France. Sweden had some military successes during the war, but paid a heavy price for winning the bloody battle at Lützen in 1632, as the king was killed in action. Gustav II Adolf’s only child, Kristina, came to the throne at the age of six. During her reign (1633–54), life at court was influenced by the world of science and philosophy.

Karl XI (1660–97) secured the border and divided the land more evenly between crown, nobility and peasants. While the body of Karl XI lay in state at Tre Kronor in 1697, a fire broke out which destroyed most of the building. The new monarch was the teenage Karl XII (1697–1718). He faced awesome problems when Denmark, Poland and Russia formed an alliance in 1700 with the aim of crushing the power of Sweden. Karl XII set off to battle. Denmark and Poland were soon forced to plead for peace, but Russia was a harder nut to crack. A bold push towards Moscow was unsuccessful and the Swedish army suffered a devastating defeat at Poltava in Ukraine in 1709. This marked the beginning of the end of Sweden’s Age of Greatness. Karl XII, possibly the most written about and controversial Swedish monarch, returned to Sweden in 1715 after an absence of 15 years. His plans to regain Sweden’s position of dominance never came to fruition and he was killed in Norway in 1718. Sweden was in crisis.

The country was at its most powerful after the Peace of Roskilde in 1658, when Sweden acquired seven new provinces. Outside today’s frontiers, the Swedish Empire covered Finland, large parts of the Baltic states, and important areas of northern Germany. Over 111 years as a great power Sweden spent 72 of them at war, but the period also marked great cultural development and more efficient state administration.

Sweden entered the fray in 1630 and joined forces with France in 1631 against the Austrian Habsburgs. The Swedish army had been reorganized and rearmed by Gustav II Adolf and immediately had successes at the battles of Breitenfeld (1630) and Lützen (1632), where the king was killed in action. Later the Swedes pressed into southern Germany and also captured Prague (1648). Rich cultural treasures were brought home from the war.

The guards and other military units in Stockholm swore allegiance to the king, who tied a white handkerchief round his arm as a badge and rode out into the city to be acclaimed by his people. Absolute power had been restored. Gustav III was influenced by the Age of Enlightenment and by French culture, which had a great effect on Swedish life (see pp40–41). Over the years opposition grew to the king’s powers, largely because of his costly war against Russia. In 1792 he was murdered by a nobleman during a masked ball at the Opera House. Gustav III was succeeded by his son, Gustav IV Adolf. During his reign Sweden was dragged into the Napoleonic wars. After a war against Russia in 1808–9, Sweden lost Finland, which at the time accounted for onethird of Swedish territory. The king was deposed and went into exile.\n\nA new constitution came into force in 1719 which transferred power from the monarch to parliament. As a result, Sweden developed a system of parliamentary democracy similar to that THE ERA OF KARL JOHAN AND of Britain at the time.

The king’s great interest in art, literature and the theatre made the late 18th century a golden age for Swedish culture, and several academies were founded at this time. After a bloodless revolution in 1772, Gustav III ruled with absolute power and initiated a wide-ranging programme of reform. But his attacks on the privileges of the nobility and his adventurous and costly foreign policy made him powerful enemies.

Gustav III studies architectural designs.\n\nCOURT LIFE AT DROTTNINGHOLM Hilleström’s painting (1779) gives an insight into court life at Drottningholm, where the king resided between June and November. In what is now the Blue Salon, Gustav III and Queen Sofia Magdalena socialized with their inner circle. Behaviour was modelled on the French court and etiquette was even stricter at Drottningholm than at Versailles.\n\nThe Battle of Svensksund Gustav III was not known as a successful warrior king, but in 1790 he led the Swedish fleet to its greatest victory ever, when it defeated Russia in a major maritime battle in the Gulf of Finland.\n\nLife in the Inns Stockholm abounded with inns, frequently visited by the city’s 70,000 inhabitants.

Gustav III embraced this trend with great enthusiasm and supported the country’s talented artists and authors. He established his own Museum of Antiquities (see p57) with marble sculptures which he brought home from Italy. In handicrafts, the sweeping lines of Rococo elegance were replaced by the stricter forms of what has become known as Gustavian Style. Rooms at the Royal Palace were Chair designed in renovated with decoration and Gustavian style furnishings adapted to suit this style.\n\nSwedish Court Costume In 1778, Gustav III introduced a court costume, based on French lines, for daily wear at court, in order to restrain fashion excesses.\n\n42\n\nI N T R O D U C I N G\n\nS W E D E N\n\nUNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE lican-friendly Social Democrats, includSweden’s population reached 5 million ing the future prime minister, Hjalmar around 1900, despite mass emigration Branting.

Prime Minister Olof Palme (1927–86), probably the best-known Swedish politician abroad, was deeply involved in questions of democracy and disarmament, as well as the problems of the Third World. He was renowned for condemning undemocratic acts by right-wing and left-wing dictators. Palme’s assassination on the streets of Stockholm in 1986 sent shock waves across the world. The murder has still not been solved. Important changes took place during the closing decades of the 20th century. These included a new constitution in 1974 which removed the monarch’s political powers. In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union after a referendum approved entry by a narrow majority. The start of the new millennium marked a change in the role of the church in Sweden, Sveavägen, the site of which severed its Palme’s murder, 1986 connections with the state after more than 400 years. Today, Sweden, like other developed countries shows signs of economic downturn, even though most people still lead a good, socially secure life. Rapid technical developments and globalization have given Sweden new job opportunities and new inhabitants, as well as a leading international role in technology and innovation.\n\nTHE WAR YEARS Sweden declared its neutrality during both World Wars I and II. Its policy of continuing to trade with nations involved in the conflict during World War I provoked a number of countries into imposing a trade blockade on Sweden. The situation became so serious that hunger riots broke out in some towns. World War II proved an even more difficult balancing exercise for Swedish neutrality, largely because its Nordic neighbours were at war. Through a combination of luck and skill, Sweden remained outside the conflict, but the concessions it had to make were strongly criticized both Neutrality stamp nationally and internationally. issued in 1942 THE POST-WAR ERA\n\nAlthough the Social Democrats dominated government from the 1930s to the 1970s, the socialist and non-socialist power blocs in Swedish politics have remained fairly evenly matched since World War II.
