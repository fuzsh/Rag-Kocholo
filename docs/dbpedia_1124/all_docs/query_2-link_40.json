        "text": "Carl Eldh and August Strindberg\n\nAround the grand temple-like gate, there are sculptures and reliefs created by the artist Carl Eldh. In the gable-shaped top of the gate, a female figure sits on a throne. She’s a symbol of the museum, but perhaps also of Mother Svea. To her, the Swedish people come bearing gifts.\n\nAbove the gable, the ancient god Odin has taken the throne, surrounded by squirrels symbolizing the diligent gatherers, namely the museum’s employees and “procurement officers.”\n\nThe reliefs on the base of the columns surrounding the gate illustrate the basic industries of agriculture, mining, forestry, and fishing. An elderly woman spinning on a spindle and a younger woman with a child in her arms are meant to represent female labor.\n\nUnderneath the reliefs, you can read carved sayings written by August Strindberg. One of them reads: “Sagas I carve that the young may remember their heritage.”\n\nThe floor of the hall rests on brick-arched vaults, and the floor surface is covered with red and gray limestone. The symbols embedded in the hall’s floor represent various metals, soils, and rocks. Originally, the Great Hall was primarily intended as a banquet hall. The museum’s founder, Artur Hazelius (1833–1901), envisioned the hall as a venue for significant national celebrations and festivities. On the drawings, the hall was referred to as the “Allmogehallen.”\n\nThe hall is 126.5 meters long and 24 meters high, making it one of the largest non-religious spaces in Sweden. It is an experience to stroll through the vestibule’s star vaults, galleries, stairs and staircases, on the Coronation Tribune, and in the Great Hall. The building has grand dimensions, yet there are many small and interesting details, such as the sculpted, dormant bear in the balustrade of one of the staircases or the folk figures carved into the capitals on one of the stairwell pillars."
