You will study at Campus Borlänge, which is located in a town characterised by thriving business and industry, surrounded by nature and the charming Swedish countryside. The town is two hours north of Stockholm and only 20 km away from the historic town of Falun, the political centre of Dalarna County. The town of Borlänge is home to some major Swedish corporations, such as SSAB and Borlänge Energi, and within a short commute to another large corporation, namely ABB.\n\nDuring the course of your studies, you will attend lectures, complete practical exercises and laboratories, prepare individual and group projects, participate in seminar discussions, enjoy study visits, and, of course, take exams. You can expect between 15 and 30 hours of class time each week, as well as a weekly study time of between 30 and 50 hours.\n\nTypically, about 30-35 students enroll in the Solar Energy Engineering Programme each year. They come from all over the world. Since the programme admits only a limited number of students, you will soon get to know your classmates and be involved in activities in and around Dalarna and Sweden with your new-found friends. The knowledge you gain and the experiences you share with your classmates will prepare you to join our alumni who go on to find their ideal jobs within the field.\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nMany of our over 250 ESES alumni are active as engineers and managers in the global solar energy industry. After graduating, many go on to start their own solar businesses, while others go on to pursue a Ph.D. and become researchers and teachers at universities. The majority of our graduates go on to work in companies and organisations throughout the world.\n\nPotential future employers are:\n\nSolar equipment manufacturers,\n\nEngineering and consulting companies with a renewable energy focus,\n\nEnergy utilities, and\n\nGovernment and non-government organisations\n\nDalarna University, together four other Swedish Universities and RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden AB) , has been granted a five-year grant from the Swedish Energy Agency to form a competence center for solar energy, called Solelforskningscentrum Sverige (SOLVE). This creates a strategic partnership between Sweden's research base in solar technologies and a broad and committed group of actors in the public and private sector.\n\nIncreasing Job Opportunities\n\nUntil a few years ago, jobs in the solar energy sector were found mostly in countries where political efforts had led to an early adoption of renewable energy, often through subsidies for businesses and private individuals to invest in renewable energy sources such as solar energy.\n\nToday the cost of solar energy is lower than ever before: it has become competitive, even without subsidies, in many developed and still developing economies. While the cost of installing solar energy has decreased, the possibility to harness and store solar energy is constantly improving, ensuring excellent long-term job prospects for programme graduates."
