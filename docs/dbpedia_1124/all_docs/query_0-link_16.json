        "text": "The article considers the voluntary based village activism in contemporary Finland. The author sees the roots of nowadays village activism in the traditional voluntary work: cultivation of common fields called for cooperation, and decision making on common issues required organisation of village meetings to make a collective decision. As a large social movement the village activism started in 1970s in the course of protest actions driven by the diminishing rural population and abandonment of arable lands. A large-scale establishment of village committees was also determined by the reduction of importance of traditional rural productive cooperation and by the changing role of countryside in the era of industrialisation. Nowadays Finland has a well-developed system of village associations, and its structure consists of three levels: village level, regional level and national level. At the local level, there are more than 4200 villages. In 2013, about 3100 villages had a registered village association and about 930 villages had a non-registered village association. Approximately 200 villages in Finland still do not perform any village activities of the considered type. As a rule, village activism generates in response to the specific needs of the village and aims to guarantee its residents' well-being. At the regional level, there are 19 regional village associations. The most important tasks for the regional rural organisations are to ensure the villages' interests and to work as a cooperative body for the rural development at the regional level. The top of the system under consideration is the Village Association of Finland. It is an umbrella organisation for the state, regional and local rural actors. The current development of rural movement in Finland could be evaluated in the framework of several theoretical conceptions: social capital and networking, entrepreneurial culture, and institutionalisation. Finland has a large proportion of rural areas that compose approximately 95% of the total area of the country; one third of population (1,6 million) live in rural areas. The Finnish countryside has experienced dramatic changes as many other countries in the last decades: ageing of population and outflow of younger generations have reduced the scope of the business activities of many rural municipalities, quite often work commuting is the only possibility for getting an income. The loss of population led to the radical reduction of services in rural areas: municipal transport connections between regional centre and villages reduced strongly; to get many municipal social services rural dwellers have to visit urban centres. The state and regional services are under changes too, and the most tragic change for the village is closing of rural schools, which are often centres of rural live and all activities. The main reason for such tendency is difficult economic situation and attempts of municipal authorities to reduce the expenses. Many small departments of different services were merged into bigger entities; railway stations, police stations, tax offices, post offices were closed in villages and small towns. The same tendency can be found in the private sector too: the number of rural shops, repair shops, etc. has reduced strongly in rural areas. Thus, village communities have to adapt to the new situation even if in some villages there is a growth of population.\n\nWood-energy network research - theoretical working paper Abstract Many of the rural, peripheral regions have been caught in the vicious circle where the diminishing prospects for financially feasible agri- or silvicultural activities and the lack of alternative jobs cause the emigration of the higher qualified and young population (regional brain-drain), which lead to declining tax revenues and diminishing infrastructural investments, which in turn, further deplete the region’s attractiveness for industry and the service sector. Eastern Finland has encountered these problems, too. Here, forests have been not only the main source of income and context of economic activity but also an important and lasting part of regional and cultural identity, social relations and traditions. Global changes (technological innovations; rising energy prices, and the climate change) however, are having a profound effect on this agro-forest economy and society; they are stimulating innovation. The social, cultural, economic and environmental consequences of the recent transformations are interrelated, and represent many challenges to face by but also opportunities offered to, regional and local development. The paper gives a summary of these interrelated processes with some reference to the recent development of the wood energy sector in the eastern part of Finland, serving as a mainly theoretical introduction to the more empirical/analytical case study of “Rural socio-technological networks for wood-energy”, a project carried out during 2008-2010."
