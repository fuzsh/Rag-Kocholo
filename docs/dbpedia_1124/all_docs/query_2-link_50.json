        "text": "Expected results\n\nThe program proposes the following measures (non-exhaustive list):\n\nP1: A smarter border region\n\nSO 1.1: Developing and improving research and innovation capacities and the use of advanced technologies\n\nProjects that contribute to the development of innovation systems and strengthen cooperation between innovation actors across borders, such as academia, public sector, industry, research institutes and organizations, based on the strengths of the programme area, as well as methods (IT, entrepreneurial discovery process) and strategies for smart specialization.\n\nProjects that contribute to increasing the pace of the green and blue transition through innovative solutions in areas such as sustainable transport, bioeconomy and circular economy.\n\nProjects that contribute to increased collaboration and knowledge transfer between research environments, businesses, the public sector and the social economy.\n\nProjects that develop practical models to bring new ideas to market\n\nProjects that support the development and growth of businesses and industries with growth challenges, including those associated with advanced technologies.\n\nProjects that improve the ability of companies to obtain, develop and commercialize new technologies and knowledge.\n\nProjects that enable applied research for the benefit of businesses.\n\nProjects that have a particular focus on improving the research and innovation capacity of companies that have established themselves as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nProjects that focus on innovative solutions that can limit the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nProjects that contribute to the development of innovative solutions to prevent and reduce damage caused by environmental disasters\n\nProjects that contribute to the development of innovative solutions for health, healthcare and education\n\nProjects that bring together stakeholders from research and innovation with stakeholders from industry to promote collaboration in new value chains in the cultural and creative industries.\n\nProjects that contribute to innovative solutions for renewable energies.\n\nProjects that develop technologies and methods for new fossil-free energy systems and energy efficiency.\n\nProjects that use digitalization as a tool for the green and blue transition in the study geography.\n\nProjects that develop/utilize innovative solutions that contribute to strong and attractive living environments and urban areas in the border area.\n\nSO 1.2: Improving the sustainable growth and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to create jobs and productive investments in these enterprises\n\nProjects aiming at cross-border structured cooperation, e.g. through clusters, networks or innovative pilot initiatives, where the cross-border added value lies in the use of each other's competences and networks.\n\nProjects that can help intensify cross-border knowledge exchange in common priority areas related to smart specialization and areas of strength, e.g. in the fields of digitalization, bioeconomy, tourism, circular economy and entrepreneurship.\n\nProjects that work across borders with gender equality, inclusion and diversity to reach more existing and potential idea holders, entrepreneurs, innovators and business owners of different ages, genders, backgrounds, skills and geographies. Among other things, this promotes more entrepreneurship, growth, good public health and gender equality, which creates cross-border added value in the form of more employment and more opportunities for skills provision.\n\nProjects that give more companies the opportunity to transfer knowledge for a sustainable green and blue transition in the border region, which contributes to value creation in the form of joint and cross-border working methods with a focus on the objectives of the Green Deal and the 2030 Agenda.\n\nProjects that give more companies the opportunity to develop digital and circular production processes. The cross-border added value here is, among other things, that it can lead to the development of general knowledge that leads to more environmentally and climate-friendly production processes.\n\nProjects to set up digital meeting points for cross-border cooperation between SMEs. The cross-regional added value are collaboration areas that contribute to climate and environmental objectives and new arenas for collaborative processes.\n\nProjects that help improve opportunities for entrepreneurs and start-ups by equipping them for an international market.\n\nProjects that help strengthen the knowledge and skills of entrepreneurs, creating the conditions for the creation of more businesses on both sides of the border.\n\nProjects that provide tools and skills to create cross-border systems of companies that together contribute to sustainable innovation in the market, e.g. in the cultural and hospitality sectors.\n\nProjects that contribute to the growth of businesses (especially internationally) through cross-border cooperation, skills development and method development.\n\nProjects that promote the cross-border development of destinations and sustainable tourism.\n\nProjects that help to increase the integration of companies in local and global value chains, for example for agriculture and food production.\n\nProjects that aim to improve access to venture capital and investment capital for entrepreneurs and SMEs within the program geography.\n\nP2: A greener border region\n\nSO 2.1: Promoting climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction and resilience, taking into account ecosystem-based approaches\n\nNetworking, exchange of working methods, creation of documentation and how to work on climate adaptation across sectors and authorities.\n\nTo create competitiveness for businesses in a changing climate, it will be necessary to examine how climate change affects businesses and their supply chains and to incorporate this into business risk assessments.\n\nForestry and agriculture is an important part of the program area's economy. The border region needs to promote forest and land management that reduces the risk of forest fires, landslides and landslides. There is recent experience to build on.\n\nForestry insurance options may change in a changing climate. More and more climate risks are no longer defined as unforeseeable events. To reduce economic losses from fires and floods, for example, it will be crucial to analyze what types of measures are needed to create resilience.\n\nContinuity and a long-term perspective are important to create resilience in the face of a changing climate. Networks between Swedish and Norwegian organizations with the aim of addressing the issues at a high level and sharing experiences would contribute to better resilience and not least competitiveness.\n\nThe border region can learn from how climate information from our meteorological institutes is used in our respective countries, how it is made available and how it is then used at a local level.\n\nDevelop shared data on landslides, erosion, snow loads, snowmelt, impacts on watercourses and other factors associated with land use in the border regions.\n\nIt is necessary to think in terms of green infrastructure to protect nature and biodiversity, as these do not respect national and municipal borders and cooperation is crucial to be successful.\n\nProjects related to a climate-adapted strategic rescue service to deal with landslides and other types of accidents. There is potential here to incorporate skills and research environments. By including the long-term perspective and the effects of climate change, stakeholders in the border region can learn from each other. In particular, the use of new technologies such as VR/AI/AR/simulation technology is important.\n\nSO 2.2: Promote the transition to a circular economy with high resource efficiency\n\nCreate opportunities for common rules between Norway and Sweden that contribute to companies switching to circular business models.\n\nCommon rules can be introduced by getting national authorities to develop cross-border training programs in the circular economy.\n\nWork on cross-border mapping, skills development and promotion of public procurement that contributes to a circular economy.\n\nWork with e.g. hospitality businesses to develop solutions that help strengthen cross-border circular models and enable new behaviors for residents and tourists.\n\nProjects that work to improve the lifespan of products, improve the reusability of products and ensure that the proportion of recycled materials in products is increased and that it is possible to recycle the material.\n\nThe use of disposable products must be restricted and planned wear and tear prevented.\n\nProjects that provide consumers with information on the availability of spare parts and repair services.\n\nP3: A more social border region\n\nSO 3.1: Strengthen the efficiency and inclusiveness of the labor market and improve access to quality jobs by developing social infrastructure and promoting the social economy\n\nProjects that create cross-border arenas that bring employers and jobseekers together.\n\nProjects that illustrate the employment potential on both sides of the border\n\nProjects that highlight the lack of professions and training opportunities on both sides of the border.\n\nProjects that harmonize certification systems that might otherwise hinder free movement.\n\nProjects that mobilize job seekers for the hospitality industry and other cross-border sectors.\n\nProjects that strengthen the efficiency of the labor market and the availability of quality jobs through the development of social innovation and social infrastructure.\n\nProjects that expand cross-border cooperation to better attract skilled labor.\n\nProjects that promote a more equal and fairer labor market.\n\nProjects that include employment policy measures to improve employability. For example, measures for jobseekers, but also measures for young people, minorities, foreign-born, people with disabilities and other groups with special needs.\n\nSO 3.2: Improve inclusive access to education, training and lifelong learning by developing an accessible infrastructure, including managing change and further developing distance learning\n\nIn upper secondary education, students should specialize. A shortage of students can lead to the elimination of certain subjects, reducing opportunities for specialization and choice. Cross-border partnerships can lead to schools offering more subjects, giving students more choice and fewer people moving away from the regions. There are also opportunities to increase the range of internships across the border.\n\nAlthough foreign-born people are described as a homogenous group in many contexts, they have very different educational needs. This is particularly true for mother tongue education. Even in large schools, it is a challenge to find teachers who cover all languages. There is a great need to find common solutions in this area.\n\nFurther training often has to be completed during a permanent position. If further training involves a long journey for pupils, this can lead to complications. At the same time, the training must be relevant to the local environment. Projects in the border region that are working on solutions for this are within the scope of the specific objective.\n\nIt is important that the Master's courses are adapted to the relevant development areas in the regions. In some cases, the base on one side of the border may be too small to offer such Master's programs.\n\nCross-border Master's programmes enable networking with local companies and organizations.\n\nJoint \"study satellites\" linked to the university can allow a greater proportion of studies to be carried out from home. However, such study satellites require relevant input from students, which can be achieved through cross-border collaboration.\n\nRelevant projects may be located on public transport to enable students to travel to the study site.\n\nProjects may also include mapping and testing a common digital infrastructure between higher education institutions.\n\nCoordinated qualification and skills development in the hospitality and cultural heritage sector.\n\nIdentification of education levels, skills needs in the labor market and opportunities to increase employment rates in the border region.\n\nImproving access to inclusive and quality-assured education and lifelong learning structures. This means robust and flexible solutions through e.g. digital distance learning and internships.\n\nProjects that contribute to greater mobility and exchange, e.g. through more trainees, study projects and doctoral students with a cross-border perspective.\n\nSO 3.3: Promote the role of culture and sustainable tourism for economic development, social inclusion and participation, and social innovation\n\nIdea design, development and anchoring of strategy work, new business models for product development and implementation of measures.\n\nThrough joint plans and strategies, tourist destinations can offer a broader range of products and services. They can also help to build place brands where small attractions have a place even without accommodation or \"all-day experiences\". Collaboration can contribute to product concepts, marketing and internationalization. Through a comprehensive plan for complementary destination attractions, the program will be able to support the development of destinations.\n\nThe program will be able to support the launch and further development of strategic events. That is, events that are linked to the development of the region and attract tourism and business development beyond the event itself. These should be multi-year events in which business, the cultural industry and associations can be involved.\n\nFunding can be provided for the development of skills that help to involve more people in the cultural, creative and tourism industries. This could be education to start a business, but also the development of skills in areas where there is a clear need and which fit into a common cross-border strategy. Examples could be training in guide services and craft methods.\n\nInnovation in the fields of culture, creative industries and tourism can be promoted under this specific objective. Innovation can also be a further development of ideas. The program can support initiatives that focus on local food and food production.\n\nGiven the vulnerability of the hospitality and creative industries that has become apparent during the pandemic, the program will support innovative measures to improve accessibility. The focus is primarily on digital accessibility, but also on other forms of accessibility that can be classified as sustainable.\n\nP4: A stronger border region\n\nSO 4.1: Strengthening institutional capacities and stakeholders' ability to cooperate\n\nEstablish methods for local place development in dialog between municipalities, business and civil society.\n\nCollect cross-border data for statistical processing.\n\nConfidence-building agreements through people-to-people cooperation.\n\nIdentify missing services in the area of application.\n\nCross-border cooperation in areas such as infrastructure, transportation and energy system solutions.\n\nread more"
