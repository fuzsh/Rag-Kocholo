        "text": "1) Vasa Museum (must see)\n\nThe Vasa Museum is a unique maritime museum experience; in fact, it is said to be the most popular museum in all of Scandinavia. It houses a 17th-century 64-gun warship that has been meticulously restored and preserved. It is a grand lady of the sea, measuring 69 meters and was built under the rule of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Intended to be the flagship of the Swedish Navy, the ship sunk on its maiden voyage, barely making it out of the harbor, when high seas and wind overtook its deck.\n\nVasa is filled with some of the most ornate and exquisite carvings ever seen on a ship of its kind. It is located in a climate and humidity controlled environment and is constantly monitored and maintained to keep it in the most ideal condition for a relic of its age. The ship is a terrific photographic subject but expect its interior to be dark, making it difficult to get that perfect photo. Besides the ship itself, the museum is filled with tools of the maritime trade and traces the history of Scandinavian maritime society.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nIt's not much of a stretch to say that there are not many ships available to examine that were built in 1628. Inside, there are several levels so you can see it from all angles.\n\nAs a bonus, at the back of the building, you can visit three interesting boats belonging to the Maritime Museum – and for free!\n\nTip:\n\nAllow a couple of hours for the visit and therefore arrive 2/3 hours before it closes – it will be much quieter then.\n\n2) Junibacken (Children's Museum) (must see)\n\nChildren's Museum (Junibacken) is located on the picturesque island of Djurgården in central Stockholm. Opened in 1996 by the Swedish Royal Family, it has become one of Stockholm’s most popular tourist destinations, ranking as the city's fifth most-visited attraction. The museum is dedicated to celebrating Swedish children's literature, with a special focus on the works of beloved author Astrid Lindgren, whose legacy is honored with a bronze statue at the museum's entrance.\n\nThe interior of the Children's Museum is a visual delight, thanks to the artistic direction of Marit Törnqvist, a Swedish artist known for her illustrations in more recent editions of Lindgren's books. The museum's design is immersive and whimsical, perfectly capturing the magical world of children's stories. Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a unique display of lockers shaped like giant book spines, each featuring titles of classic works such as Treasure Island and The Jungle Book.\n\nOne of the key attractions of the Children's Museum is the Storybook Square, a charming mock public square where each house pays tribute to a different Swedish children's author, from early pioneers like Elsa Beskow to contemporary writers such as Sven Nordqvist. The square leads to a replica of the Vimmerby railway station, which not only serves as a nostalgic nod to Lindgren's hometown but also showcases treasured memorabilia, including a letter of admiration for Lindgren from former Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nFrom the station, visitors embark on a magical train ride through the enchanting worlds created by Astrid Lindgren. Each stage of the ride is dedicated to one of her famous works, such as Madicken, Karlsson-on-the-Roof, Ronia the Robber's Daughter, Emil i Lönneberga, and The Brothers Lionheart. The journey concludes with a delightful half-size reconstruction of Villa Villekulla, the iconic home of Lindgren's most famous character, Pippi Longstocking.\n\nThe Children's Museum also features the largest children's bookstore in Sweden, a theatre for live performances, a restaurant, and a space for temporary exhibitions. These exhibitions typically focus on a specific author or character and remain in place for about 11 months.\n\nTip:\n\nChoose lunchtime wisely or make sure you take sufficient water/juice for your tot as the queues for dining can get quite long.\n\nMake sure that you get tickets for the fairy tale ride, as that is the main attraction of the place.\n\n3) Nordic Museum (must see)\n\nGuests to the Nordiska Museet located in Stockholm will be delighted to find over one and a half million items on display, which trace the rich cultural past of the country. The displays extend across centuries and eras, starting with the 16th century. Founded in 1873 by folklorist, Artur Hazelius, the museum was once known as the Scandinavian Ethnographic Collection. The building itself is a skillful example of Renaissance architecture. Made to resemble a palace, the museum opened its doors in 1907 after 19 years of construction.\n\nAfter taking in the beauty of the structure, guests are greeted in the main hall by a large sculpture of the founder of Sweden, King Gustav Vasa. The uniqueness of the collections will captivate visitors for many hours, with displays filled with items which have been common to the Scandinavian culture, including clothing and the necessities of everyday life in a Swedish domicile. Broken into collections which reflect the class system of the past, the ground floor is known as the Royal Armory, a place devoted to the natural life and riggings of the affluent class. In other parts of the museum, guests will find cultural implements which were commonly used by the provincial class and regional society of the country.\n\nTip:\n\nGet the free audio guide (available in 10 languages) at the main lobby and enjoy!\n\nAudio guides are very easy to use; you only have to key in the exhibit's number.\n\nThey also have a great restaurant with good lunch as well as coffee & tea selection.\n\nYou might consider combining the Swedish History Museum & the Nordic Museum since the latter picks up where the former leaves off (Renaissance) in historical coverage.\n\n4) Nordic Museum Gift Shop\n\nWhat to buy here: Dalecarlian horse - perhaps the most well known red horse in the world.\n\nPerhaps the most well known of all swedish artifacts, the Dalecarlian horse with its brick red color and hand painted pattern has become somewhat of a swedish trademark. The original shape is a horse carved in wood, but nowadays the famous horse come in other shapes, in crystal, ceramics or glass. The traditional and original 'Dala Horse' will always be the hand made wooden one, carved and hand painted locally in the swedish county of 'Dalarna'.\n\nThe Dalecarlian, or 'Dala Horse' is cut out of wood and hand painted in the traditional folklore or kurbits pattern that is typical for the swedish county of Dalarna, located in the middle of the country. The original and genuine horses are only made in one specific village, Nusnäs, and the original color is brick red. Other colors such as white or blue are approved, but less traditional, even as the oldest horses were not colored at all, as they were pre-dating the production of the brick-red color of the paint.\n\nImage Courtesy of Miranda Holmqvist.\n\n5) ABBA: The Museum (must see)\n\nABBA: The Museum in Stockholm is an immersive and interactive exhibition dedicated to the iconic pop band ABBA. Opened in May 2013, the museum is located on the picturesque island of Djurgården, a short walk or ride from Stockholm's city center.\n\nThe idea for a museum dedicated to ABBA was inspired by the success of The Beatles museum in Liverpool, England, and was first proposed in 2006. Although the initial plan faced several delays and financial challenges, resulting in the project being temporarily abandoned in 2009, new plans were unveiled in 2012. These plans culminated in the opening of ABBA: The Museum, which now serves as the permanent home for the ABBAWORLD exhibit that toured Europe and Australia from 2009 to 2011.\n\nThe museum offers a comprehensive look at ABBA's legacy, showcasing the band's iconic stage costumes, artifacts, concert footage, and interviews in a contemporary and interactive setting. Visitors can engage with several interactive audio and video stations, where they can perform ABBA's music, sing along with holograms of the band, and even try on digital versions of famous costumes, like Anni-Frid's 'tiger' tunic or Agnetha's 'cat' tunic.\n\nABBA: The Museum provides a unique experience for fans and newcomers alike, offering a deep dive into the history and impact of ABBA's music and cultural influence. The museum has the full support of the band members, with much of the material on display coming from their private collections. Whether you’re reliving the glamour of the 1970s or discovering the phenomenon for the first time, the museum offers a fascinating insight into ABBA's enduring legacy as a global superstars.\n\nTip:\n\nBuy your tickets in advance for a discount and get there early or later in the day (2-3 hrs before closing).\n\nOn all the interactive exhibits that require singing, you should sing loudly and directly into the microphone.\n\nPlease keep your tickets as you'll need to scan your barcode so you can download your performances/quiz results later from their website.\n\n6) Grona Lund\n\nGröna Lund is a historic amusement park located on the seaward side of Djurgården Island in Stockholm. Established in 1883 by James Schultheiss, the park is the oldest in Sweden and has a rich history that dates back to the early 18th century. Originally a small park, Gröna Lund evolved into an amusement venue when Schultheiss, a German entrepreneur, rented the area to set up carousels and other attractions. Remarkably, the park remained under the management of Schultheiss's descendants until 2001.\n\nCovering 3.8 hectares (9.4 acres), Gröna Lund is relatively small compared to other amusement parks, primarily due to its central location, which restricts expansion. Despite its size, the park offers over 30 attractions, including classic amusements such as a tunnel of love, a funhouse, and eight roller coasters. Its unique charm lies in the fact that many of its buildings are repurposed residential and commercial structures from the 19th century, around which the park was constructed.\n\nIn addition to its rides, Gröna Lund is a renowned venue for summer concerts, having hosted legendary performances by artists such as Bob Marley, whose 1980 concert drew a record-breaking crowd of 32,000 people. Due to newer regulations, this record remains unbeaten. The park continues to be a popular destination for both amusement and live music, blending historical ambiance with contemporary entertainment.\n\nTip:\n\nMany famous bands/artists play here through the summer. The best value is if you buy the season access Green Card ('Grona kortet') that gives admission for the whole season (rides are extra). The card pays off!\n\n7) Skansen (must see)\n\nThis incredibly impressive museum was the first of its kind in 1891. The open-air museum was created to celebrate Swedish culture and its traditions. The brainchild of Artur Hazelius, the founder of the Nordic Museum, Hazelius acquired land and a collection of buildings over time, which has now come to be known as Skansen. Today, this living museum paints over 300,000 square meters of the Scandinavian landscape.\n\nThe museum consists of gardens, fantastic architectural pieces, walking paths and a zoo which houses a variety of animals. Hazelius sought architectural structures which told the story of Scandinavian society. He purchased over 150 buildings throughout the country and moved them to Skansen for display. The buildings represent everything from affluent society to provincial living.\n\nGuests to Skansen can expect to spend many hours exploring the features of the museum or visiting during one of its many celebrations and festivals. Discover the crafts, which were common to Swedish society, by observing traditionally clad craftsmen or explore the zoo, which is filled with animals native to Sweden's ecosystem.\n\nWhy You Should Visit:\n\nIf you're looking to get a 'sense' of Sweden outside the confines of great halls, Skansen is the place!\n\nFriendly docents will explain really interesting things about the time period or the structure you're visiting.\n\nPlenty of food/drink outlets to keep you refreshed as you explore the 300,000 square meters site, or you can bring a picnic.\n\nTip:\n\nA must is the Skansen Aquarium and the \"monkey house\" with everything from funny baboons to scary crocs.\n\nOn different Holidays, there are some very exciting traditional celebrations that take place there."
