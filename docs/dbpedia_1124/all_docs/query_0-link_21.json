        "text": "In the abandoned Aluvere quarry near Rakvere, south of the Tallinn–Narva road, the limestone succession of the Kahula Formation, Haljala Stage (Caradoc) is exposed. In the southern wall of the quarry 6 m of limestone can be studied, characterising the Aluvere and Pagari members of the Kahula Formation (Jõhvi Substage of the Haljala Stage; Fig. 1). The limestone can be classified as wackestone to packstone with a varying content (10–25%) of siliciclastic mud. This siliciclastics content varies rhythmically, as 10–20 cm thick cycles, ...\n\nInstitute of Geology at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia< olle@ gi. ee>,< nolvak@ gi. ee>,< viira@ gi. ee> data). Most of the samples from the Kadriorg section are barren of chitinozoans. The only productive sample comes from an irregular lens of soft clay within the glauconitic sandstone of the Leetse Fm.(maximum thickness ca 1 cm) and contains an exceptional chitinozoan assemblage. The samples previously studied from other northern Estonian sites contain as a rule few specimens of up to three species.\n\n29 WOGOGOB-2004 CONFERENCE MATERIALS Scolecodonts, the jaws of polychaete annelid worms, are common microfossils in Ordovician sedimentary rocks and are currently known from many different regions of the world, eg, Australia, Kazakhstan, China, South America, North America, and Europe (Hints et al. 2004). However, except for the two latter regions, the available data are too meager to allow analyses of diversity trends and biogeographic distribution patterns at the genus and species level."
