Cold-rolled and galvanized plate production began in 1972 and tube production the following year. The manufacture of color-coated products began in the late 1970s.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna site covers 54.6 hectares and has 7.8 km of railroad track.\n\nAround 100 truckloads of products leave the site each day.\n\nLuleå, Sweden\n\nEstablished: 1941\n\nBlast furnace-based steel production\n\nCrude steel production capacity 2.3 million tonnes\n\nSSAB Europe\n\nEmployees: 1,200\n\nWhat we do\n\nProducts made: Slabs\n\nOther services: Coke production, crude iron production, steel processing, continuous casting, production, continuous casting\n\nProduct end uses: Other steel mills\n\nInteresting info\n\nIn 1938, the so-called pig iron inquiry proposed that an ironworks should be located in Luleå and in 1940 Norrbottens Järnverk AB, NJA, was founded, with the Swedish government as owner. The proximity to iron ore was one of the basic reasons for the facility in Luleå. NJA was built during the 1950s. In the early 1960s, production and sales improved significantly and NJA was Sweden’s second largest steel producer, with an annual production of 400,000 tonnes, and accounted for 30% of Swedish exports of rolled-steel products. During the 1970s, the prevailing international steel crisis triggered the start of events that led to the founding of SSAB.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, Blast Furnace 3 in Luleå produced 31.5 million tonnes of pig iron (crude iron). That's the weight of a railroad that goes 8 times around the world!\n\nNear the western guarded entrance you can find SSAB's own sports facility \"The Wellness Center.\" All SSAB employees, including spouses and children up to 21 years of age, can work out there for free. The Wellness Center offers a modern gym with classes in areas such as spinning and muscle pump. In addition, a gymnasium, a bowling alley, and a tennis court are available.\n\nMobile, Alabama, US\n\nEstablished: 2001\n\nScrap-based steel production in electric arc furnace, heavy plate\n\nCrude steel production capacity 1.2 million tonnes\n\nSSAB Special Steels\n\nEmployees: 700\n\nWhat we do\n\nProducts made: High quality steel coil and plate in a wide range of sizes with exceptional flatness and superior surface quality\n\nOther services: Coil slitting, blasting and painting, and heat treatments (normalized or quenched & tempered)\n\nProduct end uses: Heavy machinery, ships, wind towers, rail cars and more\n\nInteresting info\n\nThe Mobile steel mill was built in 2001 and SSAB began operating there in 2008\n\nThe Mobile facility is one of Alabama's largest steel scrap recyclers, consuming approximately 1.6 million tons of scrap metal per year.\n\nThrough a unique recycling program at the Mobile facility, more than five million scrap tires have been saved from landfills and used in our steelmaking process.\n\nMontpelier, US\n\nEstablished: 1997\n\nScrap-based steel production in electric arc furnace, heavy plate\n\nCrude steel production capacity 1.2 million tonnes\n\nSSAB Americas\n\nEmployees: 500\n\nWhat we do\n\nProducts made: High quality steel coil and plate in a wide range of sizes with exceptional flatness and superior surface quality\n\nOther services: Coil slitting, blasting and painting, and heat treatments (normalized or quenched & tempered)\n\nProduct end uses: Heavy machinery, ships, wind towers, rail cars and more\n\nInteresting info\n\nSSAB began operating in Iowa in 1997\n\nThe Montpelier facility is one of Iowa’s largest steel scrap recyclers, consuming approximately 1.4 million tons of scrap metal per year.\n\nIn 2010, SSAB Iowa opened a new 25,000-square-foot building for research and development adjacent to the steel mill. The R&D facility has some of the most cutting edge testing, simulation and metallographic equipment in the world.\n\nOxelösund, Sweden\n\nEstablished: 1913\n\nBlast furnace-based steel production, heavy plate\n\nCrude steel production capacity 1.5 million tonnes\n\nSSAB Special Steels\n\nEmployees: 2,400\n\nWhat We Do\n\nProducts produced: Hardox wear plate, Strenx- high strength structural steel, Armox – protection plate and Toolox – engineering and tool steel\n\nOther services: Coke production, pig iron production, post-treatment of the steel, continuous casting, formatting, quenching and tempering and painting and marking, deliveries from our own deep harbor\n\nProduct end uses: Recycling components, quarries, mining equipment, lifting equipment\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nOxelösund claims a long tradition of iron and steel production. The first ironworks for the manufacture of pig iron was built in 1914-1917.\n\nTwo of Sweden’s three blast furnaces are in Oxelösund and can together produce more than 5,000 tons of pig iron per day.\n\nOxelösund is Sweden’s only integrated steelworks – from iron ore to finished steel products. Size of the production site is twice as big as Monaco.\n\nRaahe, Finland\n\nEstablished: 1960\n\nBlast furnace-based steel production, heavy plate and strip products\n\nCrude steel production capacity 2.6 million tonnes\n\nSSAB Europe\n\nEmployees: 2,600\n\nWhat we do\n\nProducts made: Hot-rolled plate and strip\n\nOther services: Coil slitting, cut-to-length, pickling, plate components\n\nProduct end uses: Industrial applications and engineering, construction machinery, heavy transport, material handling, energy industry\n\nInteresting info\n\nRautaruukki Steelworks was established in the early 1960s.
