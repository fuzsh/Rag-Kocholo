        "text": "The Naval Port of Karlskrona is one of several UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in the southern half of Sweden. This naval port, dating back to 1680, is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a European naval town. It contains one of the few dockyards in the world where it is still possible to see buildings and docks specifically designed for the construction of sailing warships. The site includes fortifications, the naval dockyard and harbour, the historic town itself and installations in the surrounding district.\n\nThere are plenty of places to stay in Karlskrona, and many accommodations come with a sea view. Thereâ€™s no shortage of restaurants, cafes and bars to choose from either. For tips in and around the city, see our Blekinge destination page.\n\nÃ–land is a popular summer destination just off Swedenâ€™s south east coast. During summer you might spot a member of the Swedish Royal family, who have their summer residence Solliden on the island. A vast limestone plateau dominates the southern part of Ã–land, where the climate is rather dry. Despite such physical constraints, people have been living here for 5,000 years, adapting their way of life to the island. This has resulted in a unique landscape and cultural tradition which still exists today. The island can be reached from Kalmar by a six-kilometre bridge.
