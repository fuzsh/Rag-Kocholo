        "text": "Dalhalla is an open air theatre located in a former limestone quarry, and is used as a summer music venue.[1] It is located 7 km (4.3 mi) north of Lake Siljan and the municipality of Rättvik in Dalarna, central Sweden.\n\nThe quarry, previously known as Draggängarna, is 60 m (200 ft) deep, 400 m (1,300 ft) long and 175 m (574 ft) wide. It was in operation until 1990.[1] The open air theater was opened in 1995 and currently has 4,000 seats.[2] The acoustical qualities are comparable to the best outdoor stages in Europe.[citation needed]\n\nDalhalla presents 20-30 events each summer, from June to the beginning of September with a combination of opera, choral works, jazz and popular concerts making up the bulk of the program."
