        "text": "Wooden buildings housed the majority of Swedish urban populations during the early modern era. However, the crucial data around which discussions on urban housing pivot is missing and largely forgotten. The buildings have disappeared due to fire, demolition, and modernity. They were built during turbulent periods of urban transformation; disdained for their sometimes-rural look and for the fire hazard they represented, simultaneously appreciated for being warm, affordable and movable. The contextualisations of this study reveal how the wooden house played a fundamental part in forming what it is to be urban in Sweden, and in forming Swedish history. The wooden building stock was particularly apt for mass-production and moving, which helped realise the idea of the ideal town plan in the comprehensive transformation of Swedish urban space. The early modern wooden house is becoming more widespread as archaeological remains and less prominent as preserved buildings every year, thus examination and comparison of the two distinct datasets combined with historical records is important in this study. The author establishes how log timber, timber-framing and post and plank buildings were used for a wide range of functions in both central and peripheral locations and within all strata of society. New strategies for creating warm housing were developed, clearly affordable to the populace. Changes in, and continuity of layouts, featured simultaneously within the building stock, while the storeyed house attributed to evolution of the multi-unit structure. Surprisingly, this study discloses that timber-framing was more prevalent geographically and functionally than previous research indicated."
