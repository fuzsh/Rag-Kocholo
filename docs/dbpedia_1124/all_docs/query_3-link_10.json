Everything was on time. I had asked NOT to be assigned a bulkhead seat and of course, I was. But I was too tired to even care!\n\nArrived at the Stockholm airport and got checked into the Radisson Hotel which is located inside Terminal 5 – pretty strange. Grabbed a quick lunch and then got to work on answering emails. Unless I look out my “window”, I can’t tell that I am actually inside an airport."
