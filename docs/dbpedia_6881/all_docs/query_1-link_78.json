He continued by joining CORE, NAACP, and SNCC. He was one of 950 civil rights activists arrested in Jackson and held at Mississippi State Fairgrounds in 1965. After meeting Anne and Carl Braden, Grupper moved to Louisville, KY in 1969. There, Grupper became immersed in the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers Union (BCTGM), for which he served as shop steward for eight years. In 1980, the mayor appointed Grupper to the Louisville and Jefferson County Human Relations Commission.\n\nFEATURING KEYNOTE SPEAKER...\n\nHamilton Nolan\n\nLabor Journalist, Gawker alum, and Author of The Hammer: Power, Inequality, and the Struggle for the Soul of Labor\n\nWe’re THRILLED (and we think you should be, too!) to have Hamilton Nolan as our Keynote Speaker. Hamilton is a labor journalist who writes regularly for In These Times magazine and The Guardian and has written about labor, politics, and class war for The New York Times, The Washington Post, Gawker, Splinter, and other publications. He was the longest-serving writer in Gawker’s history, and was a leader in unionizing Gawker Media in 2015. He is a proud member of the Writers Guild of America, East. His recently released book—a national bestseller—The Hammer: Power, Inequality, and the Struggle for the Soul of Labor, is a “timely, in-depth, and vital exploration of the American labor movement and its critical place in our society and politics today.” The topics that Hamilton explores are incredibly relevant, now more than ever, during a time of exciting and unprecedented labor victories, especially in the south. We hope you can join us and hear from a prominent labor journalist and author who has done an “urgent on-the-ground excavation of the past, present, and future of the American labor movement.”\n\nLearn about Hamilton Nolan at www.hamiltonnolan.com/about\n\nNAMED IN HONOR OF...\n\nLyman T. Johnson\n\nKentucky Educator, School Administrator, and Desegregation Pioneer\n\nJohnson is best known as the plaintiff whose successful legal challenge opened the University of Kentucky to African American students in 1949. But by the time of that lawsuit, he had already been teaching at Louisville's Central High School for 16 years, having earned a master's degree in history from the University of Michigan in 1931. He was a local leader in the fight to equalize the pay of black and white teachers and an outspoken civil rights leader in denouncing discrimination. He led struggles to integrate neighborhoods, swimming pools, schools, and restaurants and headed the Louisville chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for six years. Lyman T. Johnson Middle School was named in his honor in 1980. Born in 1906 in Columbia, Tennessee, Johnson was the grandson of former slaves. He died in Louisville in 1997.\n\nLearn more about Lyman T. Johnson's legacy"
