        "text": "Shively – General history\n\nFollowing the settlement of Louisville at the Falls of the Ohio in 1778, farms spread out into the nearby countryside. Early landowners included Col. William Pope, Maj. Abner Field, and the Shivelys, Christian William and Jacob. Christian opened a mill and tavern on the section of his 1,000-acre (400 ha) tract near Mill Creek and the road—later incorporated as the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike—connecting Louisville to the Salt River.[5] This became the focus of a settlement known as the “Shively precinct”. He donated the land for a church in 1816 that is now known as Parkview Methodist.\n\nA stagecoach stop was opened in 1831. The Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad arrived in the 1870s.[5]\n\nShortly before the Civil War, the area became popular among German immigrants, mostly from Bavaria, and they erected St. Helen’s Catholic Church in 1897. The community was commonly known as “St. Helen’s” for the next few years, but the post office (est. 1902) could not adopt it owing to another community with that name in Lee County.[5]\n\nA streetcar line was extended to the area in 1904.\n\nEight whiskey distilleries opened nearby after the end of Prohibition. When Louisville began an attempt to annex and tax them during the Great Depression, they talked the residents of Shively into incorporating separately (finalized May 23, 1938) and annexing their district instead. Their $20-million revenue stream left the small city well funded, despite its becoming the state’s fastest-growing city during the 1950s.\n\nIncreased taxes and changing tastes closed most of Shively’s distilleries in the late 1960s. Shively’s population has gradually declined since reaching 19,223 in 1970. Budget surpluses became shortfalls, and Shively tried but failed to annex more suburban territory in Pleasure Ridge Park in 1984.\n\nThe area’s fortunes have since improved somewhat, with various public works projects occurring and some businesses moving to the area. However, the area along Seventh Street north of Dixie is still known for its seedy adult entertainment businesses.[14] Into the 2000s, the area lagged behind eastern and southern Jefferson County, with one of its few remaining large retail centers, the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) Dillard’s on Dixie Highway (est. 1956), closing in 2007 due to slow sales at the location despite the chain’s general profitability in the Louisville area.[15]"
