        "text": "Good Monday morning,\n\nHey all! I know it is a Monday, but the first day of the work week before a holiday weekend is always a little easier to stomach. Add the announcement of our first in-person Bourbon event since before the pandemic and today may have you saying “T.G.I.M.!”\n\nFirst up, we’re excited to present a Masters Series, barrel selection, and leather making event all wrapped into one. On Thursday, July 22, we’ll welcome Masters from Wilderness Trail, Kentucky Peerless, 3rd Turn Brewing, and Clayton & Crume to the Frazier. I can’t wait to host, and I hope to see you in the audience for our event’s opening toast. Secure your tickets and barrel selection bottles here.\n\nIn this week’s Virtual Frazier Magazine, our Megan Schanie shares how our education team got creative to serve 20,144 families, students, and educators in fun and creative ways during the pandemic. You’ll learn why engaged couples are burying Bourbon bottles at the Frazier and get two sweet Bourbon cocktail recipes from Heaven Hill’s Jeff Crowe in Sippin’ With Stephen.\n\nIn our Bridging the Divide conversation, Rachel Platt talks to State Representative Nima Kulkarni about the recent spike in attacks on Asian Americans and her message to find light in darkness.\n\nWe’ve got Louisville’s history with baseball and new features to Slugger Field, we’re shuffling some playing cards, we’ve got puppeteers and historical miniatures on deck, and before long you’ll be saying “Hello Monday, bring it on!”\n\nI hope you enjoy,\n\nA few weeks ago, I came across Squallis Puppeteers’ newest project and was surprised to find that it starred a puppet version of Anne Braden! A civil rights icon from Louisville was not exactly who I was expecting to see in puppet form, but I was delighted to learn Squallis is using such an interesting medium to tell Braden’s important story. I have learned a lot about Anne Braden over the past few years, and even had the opportunity to look through her papers at the University of Louisville Archives and Special Collections. Braden and the important work that she did to advance social justice in Louisville are featured in both What is a Vote Worth? Suffrage Then and Now and Cool Kentucky.\n\nSquallis’ production, The Other America: An Anne Braden Story, is inspired by Braden’s 1958 memoir The Wall Between Us. It uses tabletop puppetry, shadow puppetry, and a “crankie” scroll to tell the story of the time Anne and her husband purchased a home for a Black family, Andrew and Charlotte Wade, in an all-white neighborhood. In their new residence, the Wades were subjected to white supremacist violence and the eventual bombing of their home. Instead of punishing the perpetrators, a Jefferson County grand jury charged the Bradens with sedition for inciting a race riot.\n\nTo see this incredible story unfold in puppet form, you can watch through Vimeo for a $10 donation to Squallis Puppeteers. The donation will help support their mission to use the art of puppetry to free imaginations, create fantastic characters, and tell the stories that are important to our community.\n\nOn Miniatures Mondays, we take a figure or set of figures in The Stewart Collection, the Frazier’s vast collection of toy soldiers and historic miniatures, and use it to illustrate a battle or event from history.\n\nAbout the Set\n\n(Maker) Vertunni, (origin) France, (set) Charles VI, (date) 20th c.\n\nAbout the Event\n\nOn May 23, 1384, physician and surgeon Thomas of Bologna received a royal grant to send medicine to King Charles VI of France — also known as “Charles the Beloved” and “Charles the Mad.” Thomas also served as an astrologer and alchemist for Charles, who would rule France from 1380 until his death 1422. For Charles’ afflictions, Thomas prescribed a “philosopher’s stone” — an elixir of gold with some mercury. In a letter to Bernard of Treves, Thomas expressed concern that the king’s brothers suspected Thomas of deliberately poisoning the king; in response, Bernard wrote mercury in its crude form could indeed be poisonous, but in its liquid form [quicksilver] constituted a gift from God, Christ, and the Virgin, owing to its properties as medicine. Later, beginning in 1392, Charles’ mental health would deteriorate rapidly — marked by periodic delusions he was made of glass — possibly due in part to mercury poisoning.

A community partner of the Frazier’s, KTW has just released its first deck of illustrated playing cards — and you can purchase it in the Frazier’s Museum Store.\n\nThis deck is the first in a series that features illustrated portraits of extraordinary people whose Kentucky roots have fostered their success.\n\n“We are excited to take the artistic renderings of these exceptional individuals and create a deck of playing cards,” KTW President and CEO Shelly Zegart said. “Not only can they be used to play games, but also to educate students and enthusiasts about the artists, writers, thinkers, and game changers that are elevating the narrative of Kentucky throughout the world.”\n\nCard features include:\n\nLimited edition of 1,000 decks; first deck in an ongoing series\n\n52 illustrated cards highlighting individual portraits of people you know and people you should know\n\n16 royal cards showcasing past KTW Speaker Series program presenters\n\nCreated by artist and Kentucky to the World team member August Northcut\n\nConceived, designed, and manufactured in Kentucky\n\nPrinted in the USA by USPCC/Bicycle Cards\n\nEducators and enthusiasts interested in learning more can visit Kentucky to the World’s website and learn about the 52 influential contemporary figures highlighted on the cards.\n\n“KTW inspires Kentuckians to realize their own potential through sharing stories that boost the value of our state’s positive impact across the country and around the world,” Zegart added. “Those featured on the cards are doing just that and making these stories happen one feat at a time.”\n\nAll proceeds from the sales of the playing cards support the ongoing work of Kentucky to the World. To order cards, go to kentuckytotheworld.org/shop or visit the Frazier’s Museum Store during its hours of operation.\n\nMelissa Zoeller\n\nPR and Marketing, Kentucky to the World\n\nGuest Contributor\n\nThe day after the Frazier Museum closed its doors due to the pandemic, the Frazier’s President Andy Treinen called a Zoom meeting to begin planning how we would continue serving our community virtually. That call to action has come to fruition in many formats, including this publication, our virtual webinar series, Let’s Talk: Bridging the Divide, and the Coronavirus Capsule, a place for members of the community to process, share, and archive their thoughts and feelings related to COVID-19.\n\nSimultaneously, our Education Team was searching for creative solutions to continue engaging with families, students, and educators in safe ways. It took time, energy, and some mishaps along the way — but ultimately, we developed a menu of Virtual Field Trips for teachers to book live or as prerecorded experience with students; offered camps in person with limited capacity and virtually, depending on restrictions at the time; designed the Great Louisville Hunt and hands-on family kits, ran an NTI hub for students to complete their online school work, and presented to educators during virtual conferences.\n\nAs the school year draws to a close, and things slowly shift towards normalcy, we’d like to pause and take a moment to celebrate that, from the start of the pandemic through today, we have worked with 20,144 families, students, and educators in fun and creative ways!\n\nBest of all, our virtual programming is here to stay! We’ve found that going virtual allows us to reach further into the state and engage in ways that weren’t possible for us before. Please feel free to reach out with any questions about our virtual educational programming by emailing education@fraziermuseum.org.\n\nTales of a lost silver mine, a zoo that never was, and a frozen river. What do these stories have in common? They all took place in Kentucky!\n\nOur Cool Kentucky exhibition has endless possibilities for fascination and investigation. Local history is always a captivating topic, and we’ll get to hear some staff favorites as well as tales from guests who are experts in storytelling (more on that as we get closer to go time!)\n\nFrazier camps are taught by educators who believe kids can learn by looking, asking, and getting up and moving! Our active, story-based learning approach has kids engaging deeply, exploring the galleries, and letting some energy loose — often in the same lesson.\n\nCool Story, Y’all starts June 28!

Since its introduction to the game in 1882, the city has welcomed baseball with open arms, in one form or another. From 1882 to 1900, it was home to major baseball teams. From 1922 to the present, however, the city has hosted minor league teams — teams that hail from the farm systems of numerous major league franchises, including the Pittsburgh Pirates, the St. Louis Cardinals, and more recently the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nFans have been able to follow the action in a variety of venues over the years. From 1882 to 1922, there were the three wooden baseball parks that were used as home fields, all of which went under the name of Eclipse Park, named after one of the earliest major league ball clubs to play in Louisville.\n\nAfterwards, the steel and concrete baseball park Parkway Field, located off of Eastern Parkway, became the park of choice for minor league games hosted in the city. That was until 1956, when Cardinal Stadium opened at the Kentucky fairgrounds, hosting the home games of various minor league affiliates, including the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe Louisville Bats are thrilled to welcome fans back to Louisville Slugger Field for the return of baseball and the 2021 season. The Bats’ Home Opener on May 4 marks the first official home game in more than 600 calendar days and the team is truly looking forward to unveiling the upgraded Bats experience to fans.\n\nBaseball will look different at Slugger Field in 2021, both in the sites around the ballpark and the actual on-field product of the games. The Bats will kick off the season with a variety of additions already completed around the stadium. The full scale of renovations will likely be a season-long process, and we plan to continue to unveil completed projects throughout the 2021 season.\n\nI. BALLPARK UPGRADES:\n\nFull Color, High-Performance LED Videoboards around the Ballpark\n\nBigger, brighter and now with interactive features! The new videoboards truly upgrade the game-day experience for Bats fans this season.\n\nThe existing ribbon scoreboards on the outfield wall, as well as the upper-level overhang on the first and third-base sides have been upgraded from the traditional single-color scoreboards to full-color LED boards. The upgraded boards are capable of showing in-depth statistical information during games, can pull updates from around both Major and Minor League Baseball and have the ability to display fans’ social media posts from Twitter and Instagram.\n\nTwo New Premium Bar Areas\n\nThe Bats are helping fans make the most of their nights out at the ballpark this season with the addition of two premium bars in the outfield plazas.\n\nIn right-center field, the area formerly known as the Overlook Grill now boasts an array of new amenities and will now be the “destination spot” to enjoy a drink or two with friends. This new “Triple Play Bar” will serve a variety of new beverages, including frozen margaritas and other summer-friendly treats with bar-top tables and chairs, cornhole-style games and a shady pergola with overhead fans.\n\nDown the third-base line, fans can treat themselves to an additional upgraded outdoor drinking and dining area at the “Double Play Bar.” This premium bar will be equipped with a full-service drink menu and multiple shaded bartop areas, so fans can enjoy a unique view for Bats games by overlooking the field of play from the bar-top area.\n\nExpanded Kids Area\n\nBring the kids to the park this season and let them cut loose in the newly expanded Kids Area. The playground will feature slides, swings, a carousel, bounce pad and jungle gym.\n\nIn addition to the new equipment, the concourse area itself by the Kids Area has also undergone a facelift to include wider, more accessible walking areas and newly installed astroturf on the playgrounds.\n\nOn-Deck Club\n\nGrab some pine, or in this case, some padded luxury seats, to watch Bats baseball from directly behind home plate. The team’s new “On-Deck Club” is two rows of luxurious leather seating that extends between the home and away dugouts.\n\nThe seating section spans into what was formerly foul ground behind the catcher and umpire on the field, thus putting fans right on top of the action and actually closer to home plate than the pitcher!\n\nLuxury Suites\n\nHost a group of up to 50 people at the ballpark in the Bats’ redesigned luxury suites. Each suite is completely renovated from the 2019 season and comes complete with new furniture, top-of-the-line TVs and a variety of other upgraded amenities.\n\nWhether you’re planning a simple get together with friends or an official company outing for work, the Bats’ luxury suites can perfectly accommodate your group. Visit batsbaseball.com to make a reservation.\n\nExpanded Netting\n\nFan safety is always top of mind at the ballpark, and with the installation of our expanded netting, fans are now protected from foul pole to foul pole at Slugger Field. The new netting significantly improves the viewing experience with its revolutionary design that is 95 percent see-through.\n\nChris Robinson\n\nDirector of Communications, Louisville Bats\n\nGuest Contributor\n\nHere at the Frazier, we are willing to do just about anything to keep our clients happy, especially if it will keep the rain away on their wedding day. Well, that’s the myth anyway, and we hope it works for Grant and Maddie. Had you heard of this tradition? Of course it involves Bourbon!\n\nWe’re getting married at the Frazier History Museum’s rooftop garden on Saturday, June 5! We heard about a Southern tradition wherein the soon-to-be bride and groom, in order to ward off rain on their wedding day, bury a bottle of Bourbon (upside down) at the site of the ceremony exactly one month before the ceremony takes place. The Frazier was kind enough to let us bring our own bottle of Maker’s 46, a shovel, and a potted plant to disguise the Bourbon bottle. After the (hopefully sunny!) ceremony, our Bourbon bottle will be removed and saved for a special anniversary. After our wedding, we hope to put down roots somewhere (pun intended!) and give our little tree peony a “forever” place to grow as we grow old together!\n\nStay tuned to Virtual Frazier Magazine — we’ll have pictures from our rooftop wedding and let you know if the Southern tradition worked in keeping the rain at bay.\n\nFrom the Capsule\n\nNAMI’s Stigma-Free Workplace Initiative\n\nOur world continues to open up as we come out of our COVID cocoons. Restaurants are bustling, we’re heading back into the office, and masks are coming off. As we head back into the office, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has launched a new initiative we wanted to share with you as part of Mental Health Awareness Month. We can all be part of the change to end the stigma.\n\nNAMI’s vision is to make recovery possible for everyone affected by mental illness while ending the stigma associated with this disease. That is why they started their Stigma-Free Workplace Initiative. It's a partnership where they provide expertise and education, empowering both employers and employees to shed more light on the topic in order to build empathy while equipping teams to take the next actionable steps.\n\nWe know mental health knows no boundaries — it is an issue that unites us in our shared humanity. In a Forbes article from July 2020, the tie between diversity, equity, and inclusion is made clear: “We must recognize the essential role of mental health in this conversation and commitment. As employers move from words to actions, they can focus on mental health as an essential need at the heart of this challenge.” Another article published in HR Daily Advisor in November 2020 states: “DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] can’t succeed without mental health. They’re part of the same DNA...”\n\nAs companies and organizations move towards working in person again, there’s room for discussion around how to do this well, and how to support the workforce as we readjust. We realize transitions can be challenging, but NAMI Louisville is here to address all the factors at play in the process.\n\nNAMI Louisville's Stigma-Free Workplace Initiative is here to serve you and your employees to cultivate real change in a holistic way. Changing the conversation around stigma and mental health starts by addressing the challenges first, and we can help you reach that goal.\n\nNAMI offers multiple paths to engage in our Stigma-Free Initiative. Interested companies can reach out to me at kelsey.deyoung@namilouisville.org to schedule or learn more."
