        "text": "After an investigation headed by Commonwealth's Attorney A. Scott Hamilton, Carl and Anne Braden and five other white allies of the Wades in their quest for a home were charged with sedition in the fall of 1954. Despite Andrew Wade's testimony to the contrary, Hamilton's theory was that the entire purchase had been staged as a communist conspiracy. Only Carl Braden, perceived ringleader, was ever tried. A major piece of the prosecution's evidence was the Bradens' associations with known members of the Communist Party and their collection of more than 800 books, some of which bear a stamp from the trial and are included in this exhibit. Even racist hate mail the Bradens received was used as evidence against them in the highly fearful anticommunist climate of the time. Carl was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 15 years in prison--a conviction that was later overturned after he had served eight months and was out on the highest bail ever set in Kentucky at that time.\n\nIt’s You They’re After and Stop SA Crimes – These books became the basis of the Bradens’ being charged with sedition, a never-before-used law that had been passed during an earlier red scare after WWI. Reporters covering the case had to turn to the dictionary to understand “sedition” because so few knew what it was."
