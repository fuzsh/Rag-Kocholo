        "text": "Ira Grupper (1944-2024) was a Kentucky activist.\n\nBackground\n\nGrupper first got involved in the \"Movement\" in the New York City housing project in which he lived, around 1959. Active in rent strikes, anti-racist activities, NYC school boycott (first arrest), and in support of the work in the South.\n\nHired by Ruby Doris Smith (Robinson) to work with SNCC in Atlanta. Then moved to Hattiesburg MS and, later, Columbia MS. Returned to NY, and became a union organizer, among other things.\n\nMoved to Louisville to work with Carl Braden and Anne Braden on the staff of Southern Conference Educational Fund. Has been in Louisville ever since.[1]\n\nDSA comrade\n\nIra Grupper was a member of Louisville Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nKARA leaders\n\nKentucky Alliance for Retired Americans leaders.\n\nKirk Gillenwaters, Kay Tillow, Dale Warren, Steve Barger, Jeffrey Wiggins, Bill Londrigan, Ira Grupper.\n\nCuba\n\nThis chant meaning \"Yes to Cuba!\" \"No to the blockade!\" continuously broke out from the audience in support of the Cuban and guest speakers at the Anti-Imperialist Solidarity Conference for Democracy and Against Neo-Liberalism held in Havana between November 1st and 3rd 2019 that was attended by CCDS members Ira Grupper of Louisville, KY and Arn Kawano of the San Francisco Bay Area, CA. 1,332 representatives of 789 organizations, political parties, religious groups and intellectuals from 86 countries gathered to discuss ways to build international solidarity to oppose the illegal and immoral blockade by the US against Cuba, the longest against any country, and other acts of US imperialism and US support of neoliberal regimes in developing nations.\n\nThe closing session was attended by Army General Raul Castro, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the two presidents addressed the gathering. First President Maduro described the revival of the pink tide resistance to neoliberal governments throughout Latin America and decried the US-backed coup developing in Bolivia against its indigenous leader, President Evo Morales. President Díaz-Canel expressed gratitude to those in attendance for their solidarity with Cuba. In his speech, President Díaz-Canel said that \"Cuba is the best demonstration of how much solidarity of people's can do.\" He then went on to give examples of Cuba's solidarity with progressive and developing countries. But that simple sentence describes the reason the US government is using the overt blockade and covert subversive measures to overthrow the Cuban socialist government.\n\nThe conference ended in the spirit of another chant often heard during the conference: \"El pueblo unido, jamás será vencido!\" \"The people united will never be defeated!\"[2]\n\nDisability activism\n\nIn the 1970's Grupper was among the first group of disabled complainants in the United States to win a handicap employment discrimination complaint under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the predecessor to the ADA, the Americans With Disabilities Act.[3]\n\nActivism\n\nFormer Vice-Chair of the Louisville & Jefferson County Human Relations Commission.\n\nGrupper has been to the Middle East four times, once for 6 months, based in Jerusalem, spending time in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Amman, Jordan.

There has been much confusion and unclarity among the left and progressives in the U.S. about these events. It was for this reason that several of us in CCDS felt compelled to do what we could to counter a well-organized social media disinformation campaign.\n\nWe issued a statement last month titled, \"Challenging US Imperialism in Latin America.\" It is in part a response to John Bolton's \"Troika of Tyranny\" speech in which he has called for regime change in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Congress passed the NICA act which imposes economic sanctions on the Nica government, similar to the sanctions imposed on Venezuela - in the name of \"humanitarianism and democracy.\"\n\nOur task force meets every six weeks. We invite all to join. Some CCDS members are active in local committees organizing in defense of Venezuelan sovereignty. Duncan McFarland forwarded to us a statement by the Boston Venezuela Solidarity Committee. A committee is soon to be organized by our comrades in Corvallis, Oregon. In NY, a group of activists including myself met this past week and will continue to meet with the aim of getting accurate information out about the situation in Nicaragua. CCDS has been invited to participate in the 40th anniversary of the Sandinista revolution on July 19th.\n\nMembers who have attended meetings are Courtney Childs, Arn Kawano, Karl Kramer, Ira Grupper, Harry Targ, Jay D. Jurie, and Pat Fry.[20]"
