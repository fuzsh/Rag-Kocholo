Brenner attended public school from age 6 to 14, where his artistic talent was recognized by his teacher, who requested permission from King Ludwig I for Brenner to be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Brenner's father refused consent and trained his son as a glazier.\n\nIn 1853, Brenner emigrated with his family to the United States where they first lived in New Orleans. The family moved to Louisville, Kentucky in the winter of 1853-54. There, Brenner found work as a glazier, house painter, and sign painter.\n\nArt career and style[edit]In 1863, Brenner was commissioned by Louisville Masons to paint panoramic Civil War battle scenes inside their lodge. By 1867, Brenner had a studio located at 103 West Jefferson Street in Louisville. He became a professional painter by 1871, by selling his landscapes of Cherokee Park. In his lifetime, Brenner was considered Kentucky's greatest living artist. He was one of a group of Louisville artists known as \"Tonalists\", whose muted colors evoked mood.\n\nBrenner's works were exhibited at the Louisville Industrial Exposition in 1873 and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1876. One of his most notable paintings is Falls of the Cumberland River, Whitley County, Kentucky, executed 1881-82. Brenner became a member of the National Academy of Design in 1877 and remained active until 1886.\n\nHis works are collected throughout the United States, including the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and the Speed Art Museum in Louisville.\n\nPersonal life and death[edit]Brenner married Anna Glass in 1864; together they had six children, of whom Carl, Jr. (1865-1929) also became an artist. Brenner died in Louisville on July 22, 1888 and is buried there in St. Louis Cemetery.\n\nReferences[edit]Louisville artist Carl Christian Brenner (1838-1888) is profiled in “Brrr, It’s Cold Outside …” which was posted on February 5, 2013, and can be directly linked at: https://kentuckyonlinearts.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/brrr-its-cold-outside/\n\nCarl’s most iconic paintings are detailed landscapes of his favorite haunts: scenes from what is now Cherokee Park and along River Road in Louisville, Pewee Valley in Oldham County, and the hills just across the river in New Albany, Indiana. His favorite subject was beech trees. Brenner married Anna Glass (1843-1936), daughter of an eminent Louisville violinist, in 1864 and they had six children. Three sons inherited his artistic talent; Edward became an architect and Proctor Knott (named after Carl’s close friend, Kentucky governor James Proctor Knott) studied art before taking holy orders at St. Meinrad Abbey in Indiana. Carolus (1865-1924), who painted this portrait of his father, studied art in Germany and France before settling in Chicago. Several works by Carolus are also in KOAR and the Filson Historical Society has photographs taken by both Carolus and his brother Edward in its special collections. A catalogue of the J.B. Speed Memorial Museum’s 1947 exhibition “Kentucky Paintings by Carl Christian Brenner” can be found at:https://speedweb.speedmuseum.org/pdfs/brenner.pdf\n\nBrrr, It’s Cold Outside …Can you imagine painting outdoors during the bitter cold snaps we have endured this year in north-central Kentucky?\n\nThat is exactly what Louisville artist Carl Christian Brenner did! “The weather never stopped Brenner,” wrote Jean Howerton Cody in a 1979Louisville Courier-Journal column. “He would set up his easel and a folding chair in a portable hut with large glass exposures and paint away in rain or snow.” Brenner loved nature and being outdoors, especially rambling around the forests and fields of his adopted hometown and its vicinity. As Diane Heilenman described in a 1985 Louisville Courier-Journal article, “Wearing his artist’s hat and carrying a staff and a paint box, Brenner was a familiar figure in Louisville parks and Pewee Valley woods.”\n\nBrenner’s most iconic paintings are detailed landscapes of his favorite haunts: scenes from what is now Cherokee Park and along River Road in Louisville, Pewee Valley in Oldham County, and the hills just across the river in New Albany, Indiana. His favorite subject was beech trees, as illustrated above. He painted other Kentucky views as well, including the Cumberland Mountains and the Falls of the Cumberland River in Whitley County. At various times Brenner also visited the Southern wetlands and highlands to paint, and traveled West to the Plains states, Colorado, California, Washington, Oregon, and the Rocky Mountains. (Brenner is also known to have occasionally painted portraits and experimented with printmaking and graphic art.)\n\n“Brenner’s view of the city’s parks and woods were THE thing in Victorian Louisville,” declared Heilenman. “Louisville author Meliville O. Briney once wrote, ‘If you grew up in Louisville, a Brenner painting on the wall is as much a part of your pleasant childhood as a rose-back sofa in the parlor or the fire of cannel coal that burned in grandma’s grate.’” While his works demonstrate a wide range of styles, including Realism and Romanticism, after 1878 Brenner was considered part of a group of Louisville artists known as Tonalists, who used muted color to evoke mood. Brenner paid special attention to seasonal effects and time of day through his sensitive rendering of natural light and shadows.\n\nCarl Christian Brenner was born August 1, 1838 in Lauterecken, Bavaria (Germany), and attended public schools there from age six to fourteen. According to “A Biographical Sketch of Carl Brenner” in The Biographical Encyclopaedia of Kentucky of the Dead and Living Men of the Nineteenth Century (1878), a teacher who recognized his artistic talent made application to King Ludwig I for Carl’s admission to the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. The king readily granted permission but Carl’s father, a glazier by trade, refused consent for Carl to pursue further art studies. His father objected to art as a career, believing that nobody could make a living as an artist, and wanted Carl to train (and join two other sons) in the family business.\n\nThe Brenner family emigrated to the United States in 1853, when Carl was fifteen. They landed in New Orleans, where there was a strong German presence in the arts community, and stayed there briefly before journeying upriver that winter to Louisville, Kentucky, which also had a substantial German population. Carl remained in Louisville for the rest of his life. He originally worked with his father as a glazier (which turned out to have been a handy skill for constructing that portable hut!), then later as a house, sign, and ornamental painter. Carl’s artistic workmanship drew much admiration, however, even when used just for painting signs.\n\nNot long after arriving in Louisville, Brenner’s talent was noticed by an influential patron of the arts, George P. Doern, publisher of the Louisville Anzeiger, a German-language city newspaper. After seeing Brenner’s pencil sketches of scenes along the Mississippi River, Doern advised him to become a landscape painter. In 1863, Brenner received his first professional artist’s commission, a vast panorama (35,000 square feet) of Civil War scenes, from its beginning through the battles at Chancellorsville, for the Masonic Hall of Louisville. By 1867, Brenner had rented a studio at 103 West Jefferson Street, where he pursued his true passion of painting canvases when he was not painting signs and houses to afford his avocation.\n\nIn 1871, Brenner began devoting more of his energies to landscape painting. His friend, U.S. Representative (and future Kentucky governor) J. Proctor Knott is said to have boosted Brenner’s career around 1874 by arranging for the sale of his painting Beeches to William Wilson Corcoran, founder of the Washington, D.C., gallery that bears his name. (Brenner named one of his sons after Knott.) Encouraged by the Corcoran sale and the Civil War panorama commission, Brenner gave up his business to become a full-time landscape painter at the age of forty, using his earnings as a glazier, house, and sign painter to establish his own studio at 407 South Fourth Street (Fourth and Jefferson) in 1878.\n\nBrenner had become a very popular and well-esteemed figure about town. “Night-time sales of his work in his gas-lit studio were social events of the time,” stated Heilenman. (Sounds a bit like the current First Friday Trolley Hop tour of art galleries in downtown Louisville, doesn’t it?) Cody shared a contemporary account of one such event: “Every year, just before Christmas, Brenner conducted his annual auction at his studio. A newspaper account in 1885 noted, ‘The studio was well filled last evening. The bidding was lively, although the pictures went for very modest sums.’ The top price was $113.” Heilenman also noted, “Prices rose from $35 a painting in the 1870s to more than $1000 just before his death.”\n\nDuring his lifetime, Brenner was the most well-known of Kentucky artists. His paintings were exhibited in Vienna, Philadelphia, New York, and California, as well as regionally in the first Louisville Industrial Exposition in 1874 (and every subsequent annual exposition) and the 1883 Southern Exhibition on the site of what is now St. James Court in Old Louisville.\n\nBrenner’s 1864 marriage to Anna Glass, daughter of an eminent Louisville violinist, produced six children. Three sons inherited his artistic talent; Edward became an architect and Proctor Knott studied art before taking holy orders at St. Meinrad Abbey in Indiana. Carolus showed such promise that he was sent to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, since his father knew for certain that one could indeed make a living as an artist! Several works by Carolus are also in KOAR, one of which is included as the last image here. (Perhaps more on Carolus in a future blog…)\n\nCarl Christian Brenner died of a kidney ailment on July 22, 1888, in Louisville and is buried in St. Louis Cemetery. “Henry Watterson, editor ofThe Courier-Journal, wrote in 1888, shortly before Brenner’s death at the age of 50, ‘It was a grand triumph of Carl Brenner, an untutored sign painter of limited education and little or no instruction in art, to have painted the beech better than any American dead or alive,’” Cody quoted, then later continued, “Brenner, at the time of his death, was written up in the London Magazine of Art. Not bad for a self-taught artist from Louisville.”\n\n.\n\nAn image of Carl Brenner sketching on the Kentucky River is available at:http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mmhesse/Brenner.html#sketching\n\n“Brenner on the wall used to be central to being a kid” by Jean Howerton Cody in the Louisville Courier-Journal, November 8, 1979, is available at:http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mmhesse/Brenneronthewall.jpg\n\n“A Legacy – Carl Brenner 1838-1888” by Diane Heilenman in the Louisville Courier-Journal, February 3, 1985, is available at:http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mmhesse/BrennerLegacy.jpg\n\nAvailable through the KOAR Publications webpage(http://www.koar.org/publications.htm) are:\n\nCatalogue of the J.B.

Cincinnati, OH. - 1878\n\n\"Carl C. Brenner, Landscape Painter, was born August 1, 1838, at Lauterecken, on the Rhine, in Bavaria, where his father Frederick Brenner, lived, a glazier by trade. He attended the public schools of his native village, from his sixth to his fourteenth year; was considered one of the brightest of his class, and showed such decided talent in drawing that his teacher made application to King Ludwig I for his admission to the Academy of Fine Arts, at Munich. The king was ever ready to assist artistic talent, and readily granted the permission; but here he met with opposition from his father, who, as himself and two other sons were glaziers, desired that Carl also should follow the trade, and refused to allow him to prosecute his art studies. He therefore worked with his father until 1853, when the family emigrated to America, arriving at New Orleans in the Winter of that year, and went to Louisville, Kentucky. Here his talent was discovered by Mr. George P. Doorn, proprietor of the \"Anzeiger,\" who noticed some of his excellent pencil sketches of Mississippi scenery, and at once advised him to become a landscape painter. He therefore made use of his earnings as glazier, and also house and sign painter, to pursue studies for that purpose, and his work since attests the genius that enables him so faithfully to portray nature. Even when employed on sign painting, his artistic workmanship drew much admiration, and many beautiful samples were on exhibition at the Louisville Exposition, and the International, at Vienna. His landscapes have always met with ready sale, and are found in many of the prominent art-galleries of the United States. In social life he is very popular and occupies a high place in the esteem of his countrymen. He was married, in his twenty-sixth year, to Miss Anna Glass, the accomplished daughter of an eminent musician of Louisville.\"\n\nTOP\n\nMid-continent ...
