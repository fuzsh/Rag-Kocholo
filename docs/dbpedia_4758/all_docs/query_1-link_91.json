        "text": "Passed away at home peacefully, in the loving company of his family, on November 28th, 2014 at the age of 90. “Sweet William” was born on Michigan St. in Victoria, BC on December 29th, 1923 to Charles Leo and Helen Ferguson. Predeceased by his 2 younger sisters Edith and Yvonne, Bill is survived by his eldest sister, Helen; Mary, his loving wife of 68 years; his 4 children, Brian, Mark (Lori), Lloyd (Roberta) and Marianna Fiocco (Nick); his 9 grandchildren, Lani, Joseph, Kristen, Graeme, Carly, Tara, Dana, Marc and Dante and his great-grandchildren, Lola, Gracie and Nino. He will be dearly missed by many other relatives, friends, past employees and colleagues. After graduating from Victoria High School, Bill joined the Royal Canadian Navy as a wireless operator and served for his Country in WWII. Upon returning, he joined Canadian Pacific Steamships, plying the waters of the West Coast from Seattle to Alaska for 10 years. He worked as a Purser and later in the Victoria ticket office. In 1945, Bill met Mary while she was a nursing student at St. Joseph’s Hospital and they wed in 1946. He worked for Blaney’s Travel for several years and in 1963, founded Totem Travel Service. Bill was a prominent member of the business community in Victoria and a proud member of Rotary, Gyro, Capital City Executives Assoc., Sales & Marketing Executives and SKAL club. He was President of the Victoria Cougars Junior “A” Hockey Club in the late 60’s. In his leisure time, his love of the water would find him spending many years on the “Strega” and “San Pio” fishing and boating with friends and family. He also enjoyed golfing as a long time member of the Uplands Golf Club, curling at Playland and Victoria Curling Clubs and loved playing cards with family members (which partially funded his retirement!) but hated losing. He was a gentleman, had a brilliant mind for business and was sharp to his last breath. Special thanks to the Royal Oak Palliative Care Team.\n\nA celebration of Bill’s life will be held in McCall’s Floral Chapel, Johnson & Vancouver Streets, on Saturday, December 6, 2014 at 1:00 pm. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory would be appreciated to the Salvation Army. Condolences may be offered to the family below.\n\nMcCall Bros. Funeral Home"
