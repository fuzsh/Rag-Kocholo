        "text": "American Army pile field jacket as issued to Australian forces during the Korean War. The jacket is made of olive green cotton poplin with machine knitted woollen cuffs and collar. The body is lined with olive green synthetic fleece, while the sleeves are lined with woollen fabric. There is a front closure fastened by large plastic buttons and loops of cord instead of buttonholes. Six buttons would have originally been fitted, but the topmost one has been replaced by a pale brown button of similar size to the originals, and the bottom pair of buttons are missing. At the waist, there are a pair of slash pockets, lined with woollen fabric, and having no fastenings or flaps. Inside the collar is a small white fabric tag printed in black with the size marking '40L'. A larger white fabric label sewn below this has heavily faded printing upon it, which is believed to read: 'JACKET, FIELD, PILE Wear Jacket, Field, M-1943 or Parka, Field, Cotton, OD or Parka, Over, White over this Jacket. This item not intended to be worn as an outer garment except when under shelter. This jacket should not be laundered. Dry clean only.' There is a further label giving manufacturer's and contract details inside the right hand pocket. There are a number of tears and holes in the outer fabric of the jacket.\n\nUS Army issue 'Jacket, Field, Pile, OD' (Olive Drab) designed for wear in cold climates. The jacket was intended as a liner for the 'Jacket, Field, Combat, M-1943', the 'Parka, Field, Cotton, OD' or the 'Parka, Field, Over, White', and was lined with wool and synthetic fur. As it was neither wind- nor waterproof, the pile jacket was not intended for outer wear, although it was frequently worn as such. This garment proved very successful and popular with troops, and remained in service long after the Second World War. It was widely issued to Australian forces during the Korean War, to combat the extreme shortage of efficient Australian cold weather clothing. This example was worn by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bruce Ferguson DSO, MC, commanding officer of 3 Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, between November 1950 and June 1951. During this period, 3 RAR fought the battle of Kapyong, and Ferguson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership in this crucial defensive action. The Official Historian of the Korean War said of him that 'He was an outstanding fighting soldier and battalion commander in the finest traditions of the First AIF and the Second AIF.'\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
