This pretty much sums up most people’s experience of Questacon. But after my visit this week I can assure you that Questacon has much more to offer (plus the earthquake house was closed for maintenance….devastating).For my visit, I took along my buddies Sarah and Jeremy and together we had a fun filled afternoon learning about the wonders of science. Now, I admit that all of us being scientists we are genetically predisposed to enjoy anything remotely science-related, but I can assure you that Questacon really is a great attraction for anyone who is open to discovering and learning new things or who just likes to have a bit of fun.\n\nI was impressed with how comprehensive the centre really is, housing a number of exhibitions each based around a different theme such as invention and technology, music, the earth, water and more. My favourite exhibition by far was Perception Deception, which is all about brain tricks and visual illusions.Questacon has recently opened a new exhibition called Excite @ Q! It’s all very futuristic and interactive with a four player air hockey table, a reflex tester and of course Free Fall. Free Fall is exactly what it sounds like: a 6-metre drop disguised as a giant slide. Now, I had promised myself that I would have a go on Free Fall however in the light of day it was a lot bigger than I had remembered. Nevertheless, I donned my trendy orange jumpsuit (very prison chic) and climbed the stairs in preparation for my fall. While I had to let a number of children overtake me as I gathered my composure I am happy to say that I gave it a go and yes, it was terrifying. Rumour has it they are soon installing a 360 degree swing, I may or may not be attempting it!\n\nAll in all, a great day of fun science fun was had at Questacon.We didn’t get to catch any of the live shows but Questacon’s Excited Particles perform exciting and interactive science shows every half hour in the Japan Theatre and from what I’ve heard they are worth a look! For more information about Questacon: The National Science and Technology Centre you can visit their website: http://canberra.questacon.edu.au/\n\nDetails:\n\nAddress: King Edward Terrace, Canberra, ACT (Next to the National Library)\n\nOpening Times: 9am – 5pm everyday\n\nCost: $20 for Adult, $15 for Concession and $15 for Children"
