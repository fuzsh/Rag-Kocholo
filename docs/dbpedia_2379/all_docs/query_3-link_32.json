        "text": "It’s not always easy to get away for school excursions. At remote rural schools, the financial burden of travelling long distances can add substantially to the cost of even simple activities. Equally, the task of organising excursions for students who may be coping with mobility issues can add an extra layer of complexity and cost for special schools.\n\nSo, in a clever twist on the old adage of bringing the mountain to Mohammed, why not consider bringing the excursion to the classroom instead.\n\nIt’s over 25 years since the circus first began presenting interactive science shows in local schools. For the local community, an added bonus when the circus rolls into town are 50 science exhibits unloaded from the truck and set up as a public, hands-on exhibition in a community space for everyone to learn and discover science and technology together.\n\nQuestacon’s outreach programs visit thousands of schools in every state and territory every year, with an estimated 300,000 people in local communities taking part in the programs and exhibitions they bring.\n\nBut, if you can’t wait for Questacon’s visit, many state museums offer outreach programs in their own states, with some activities even available by post.\n\nWild Action Zoo, “where the zoo comes to you”, has been bringing into the classroom all sorts of scaled, furry and swimming creatures since 1994.\n\nAll Wild Action Zoo’s incursions are tailored to suit the age range and curriculums of Victorian classrooms. And all include the opportunity for students to touch and interact safely with animals.\n\nWild Action Zoo also works with special schools, early intervention groups, and adults with disabilities.\n\nAs one of WA’s biggest professional learning providers, Scitech delivers educational programs to around 2500 teachers every year. That includes an extensive range of outreach programs.\n\nEven daily working rural experiences can be brought into city classrooms. Animals on the Move, in Gembrook Victoria, will bring Brandy the milking cow to school so that children from kindergarten to year 2 can see that milk, butter and cream doesn’t just come from the supermarket.\n\nIn the hour and a half-long activity, children can take turns to milk Brandy, discover how to separate the cream from the milk and finish with making butter using different methods."
