        "text": "Joint media release with the Minister for Finance, Senator the Hon Katy Gallagher\n\nQuestacon, Australia’s national home of science and technology, will receive $60 million in new funding so it can continue inspiring the next generation of Australian children.\n\nThe Albanese Government believes strongly in securing the future of Australia’s most cherished institutions, including Questacon.\n\nRestoring them is a source of national pride after a decade of neglect under the Liberals and Nationals.\n\nThe new funding will support critical property upgrades to maintain visitor safety, inspiring and interactive experiences for visitors, and national STEM programs to bring science and technology to Australians across the country.\n\nThe boost to Questacon’s funding is ongoing with Government providing an additional $15 million per year beyond the forward estimates.\n\nThe funding will enable Questacon to remain a state-of-the-art facility which can accommodate growing numbers of visitors in the years to come.\n\nQuestacon brings Australian science to life. Its world-class programs, displays and interactive digital activities inspire children to develop a life-long interest in science and technology.\n\nOpened in 1988, half a million people pass through the doors of Questacon each year – many of which are school children on excursions.\n\nIts national programs reach more than 70,000 people in regional and remote areas each year.\n\nQuotes attributable to Senator Katy Gallagher, Minister for Finance:\n\n“The Albanese Labor Government is cleaning up the mess left behind by the previous government and providing ongoing funding to Canberra’s national institutions after a decade of neglect.”\n\n“Questacon is a much-loved attraction in the National Capital and it’s important that it receives long-term sustainable funding, so it can continue educating and entertaining visitors into the future.”\n\nQuotes attributable to Ed Husic, Minister for Industry and Science:\n\n“The fact that the Liberals and Nationals failed to properly fund Questacon shows their contempt for science, technology and this national institution.\n\n“Many of the Australian Government’s decisions are informed by science, and that starts with ensuring our nationally beloved home of science and technology is well taken care of.\n\n“It is no secret we need more kids pursuing STEM careers. Inspiring the next generation of scientists is critical to Australia’s future.\n\n“A school visit to Questacon is a rite of passage for so many Aussie kids. And seeing science brought to life can be the spark that ignites a lifelong passion for science.\n\n“Questacon plays an important role in the Australian Government’s mission to widen the pipeline of talent available to the science and technology sectors, and to reach 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\n“By securing Questacon’s future, Australians will be able to visit this iconic national institution for generations to come.”"
