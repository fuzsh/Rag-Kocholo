        "text": "For more than two decades the national science and technology centre in Canberra has been exciting and inspiring children across the country.\n\nThe idea for Australia's first interactive science centre began in 1980 as an Australian National University project operating out of Ainslie Public School.\n\nOn November 23, 1988, the iconic Questacon building was opened on the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, thanks to funding from both the Australian and Japanese governments.\n\nQuestacon director Professor Graham Durant says the facility has grown from a modest volunteer-run project to one of the world's leading science centres.\n\n\"Part of the original idea was to encourage children to take an interest in science through hands-on learning,\" he said.\n\n\"Creating a facility for that to happen on a larger scale and also be a base for outreach across Australia was really the aim of this larger facility.\n\n\"And to place science and technology on an equal footing in the parliamentary zone with other cultural institutions - the art galleries, museum and National Library.\"\n\nFrom close encounters with sharks and spiders to learning the concepts of measurement, Questacon's seven major exhibitions offer children and students excitement and inspiration.\n\n\"We hope that children then go away from Questacon with changed attitudes or questions,\" Professor Durant said.\n\n\"We know from various bits of research there is that impact - changing behaviours and attitudes to science and technology.\n\n\"We create a very good venue for families to learn together - and that's very important these days. Sadly there's not so many opportunities for parents and children to really enjoy themselves together and learn together, so that's an important element of what we do.\"\n\nProfessor Durant says Questacon aims to motivate students.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Australia, as it moves forward into this century, is going to need a lot of bright people working collectively on a lot of really quite difficult problems, many of which have a scientific dimension - whether its climate change, food or water,\" he said.\n\n\"It's really trying to encourage people to think differently, to experience things but not be afraid to try things out.\n\n\"Giving people the confidence to get hands-on, get stuck in I think is very important and the creativity and innovation that flows from that is also very important.\"\n\nOutreach programs\n\nOver the last 20 years, Questacon has developed exhibitions, websites and outreach programs for children across Australia.\n\n\"The impact of Questacon really does extends way beyond Canberra, across Australia and into the international community,\" Professor Durant said.\n\nMore than 405,000 people visit the centre in Canberra each year while the outreach programs are taken to more than 300,000 students in remote and regional parts of Australia.\n\n\"We go to very small communities, outer metropolitan areas. If you look at a map of Australia, over the 20 years that we have been operating from this building we have visited just about every community and many communities more than once,\" Professor Durant said.\n\n\"[We] develop a series of programs so that over a four year cycle we manage to get to around most locations.\"\n\nBirthday celebrations\n\nSince the opening of the new building Questacon has maintained a close working relationship with Japan.\n\n\"We've had ongoing relations with them, a large number of distinguished visitors and exchange programs,\" Professor Durant said.\n\n\"This year in particular ... we've had a full year of programs involving various Japanese groups either coming here or Australian groups going to Japan.\"\n\nTo celebrate the link Questacon has hosted a series of exhibitions on Japanese research as part of its 20th birthday celebrations.\n\nThe latest in the series is on deep ocean research and opens tomorrow.\n\n\"They're telling some of the stories of the evolution of the earth and the evolution of the oceans over hundreds of millions of years,\" Professor Durant said.\n\n\"By drilling into the crust and through the crust they can get insight into the chemical processes that created the ocean basins.\"\n\nProfessor Durant says Mechanics Alive - a temporary exhibition from the United Kingdom - is also now open ahead of Sunday's birthday celebrations.\n\n\"I'd love to think that some of the visitors seeing that will says 'I can do that',\" he said.\n\n\"Because using very simple bits of wood you create these fascinating little machines and I think it would be a great hobby if in the sheds of Australia if people start tinkering.\n\n\"You learn all sorts of interesting practical skills by doing it but also the fundamental basics of mechanics which of course is where the industrial revolution started ... and I think we are in danger of losing some of those fundamental skills about how machines work.\""
