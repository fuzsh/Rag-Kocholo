        "text": "PRIME MINISTER\n\nCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY\n\nSPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER\n\nill OPENING OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CENTRE\n\n11 CANBERRA 23 NOVEMBER 1988\n\nYour Excellency, Mr'Yanagi,\n\noman Sir Neil Currie,\n\nMs Wendy McCarthy,\n\nMr Eishiro Saito,\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nest Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\nwill 1988 has been a memorable and exciting year for Australians.\n\nOur Bicentenary has provided a magnificent opportunity not\n\nonly for celebration but also for more enduring achievements\n\nwhich, long after 1988 has entered the history books, will\n\nng be appreciated by future generations of Australians.\n\nThe National Science and Technology Centre is just such a\n\nproject: innovative, important and enduring.\n\ne ens There is of course only a very small number of national\n\ninstitutions deemed worthy of location here in the\n\ne a Parliamentary triangle the focal point both of Canberra's\n\nhe formal life and of its tourist activity.\n\nand The decision to place the National Science and Technology\n\nCentre among these premier institutions in this area\n\nreflects the high priority the Government attaches to it.\n\nAnother proof of the importance we attach to this Centre is\n\nthe decision taken by Cabinet this week, which I am pleased\n\nto announce tonight, to establish the Centre as a statutory\n\ncorporation. in this form, the Centre will receive the\n\nrecognition it deserves as a significant national\n\ninstitution, and will also have the maximum autonomy to\n\npursue corporate sponsorship and other commercial\n\nactivities. So the Government does see this Centre as very important\n\nand before I express my thanks to the many people who\n\ndeserve recognition for their contribution, I want briefly\n\nto explain why this Centre is an important addition to\n\nCanberra an3 to Australia. 372Lt\n\nn i.\n\nIt is no overstatement to say that as welcome as this\n\nbuilding is in 1988, it is perhaps a pity that it was not\n\nopened, say, twenty years ago.\n\nif it had been, there would already have been two decades\n\nduring which Australian children were brought up with the\n\ninsights into science, and the enjoyment of science, that\n\nthis Centre now provides.\n\nThat could only have been to the benefit of the Australian\n\neconomy and to the Australian community.\n\nBecause if we are to have an economy restructured so as to\n\nallow us sustainable prosperity in the future, we need to\n\nget the fundamentals right first.\n\nAnd one of these fundamentals is scientific research.\n\nIt has been argued by the Australian scientific community\n\nthat the hands and minds that should shape Australian\n\nscience into the next century are not being attracted to\n\ncareers in science.\n\nIf that is so, it would be a tragedy for all of us.\n\nWhat is needed is a concerted national effort to encourage\n\nthe further development of science and technology in\n\nAustralia. The taxpayer is already contributing, through Government\n\nprograms, a fair share to this effort through tax\n\ndeduction schemes, through direct funding of basic and\n\napplied research through the CSIRO and elsewhere, and\n\nthrough the education system.\n\nAccord-ing to the OECD, th e Australian public sector's\n\ncontribution to research compares favourably, as a\n\nproportion of GDP, with similar countries.\n\nThe reforms to our education system now being put in place,\n\nincluding the massive expansion in university places, will\n\ncontinue this trend.\n\nThe work of the Australian Sci'lnce and Technology Council\n\nwill continue to provide an important and valued source of\n\nindependent advice to the Government.\n\nThe Government has also shown it is prepared to coordinate\n\nresearch in new and emerging areas of inquiry, such as our\n\nrecently announced studies into the Greenhouse effect.\n\nJust two weeks ago Australia was elected to vice\n\nChairmanship of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n\nset up by the United Nations and the World Meteorological\n\nOrganisation. This gives Australia a leading position in\n\nthe panel activities which'are seen as a prime focus for\n\nworld activity on the Greenhouse effect.\n\n3* 722\n\nBut because of the fundamental importance of scientific\n\nresearch, the Government recently decided to investigate\n\nwhat further support should be given. I established a\n\nsenior officials group to suggest short and long term\n\nmeasures that can be taken to strengthen our research and\n\ndevelopment effort. This group will present a preliminary\n\nreport to Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee next\n\nweek. I can * assure you this process is not a cosmetic exercise to\n\nstifle voices of concern. I and my colleagues will be\n\ntreating the report seriously and reacting positively.\n\nUltimately, however, Government can't do the job on its own.\n\nindustry has to play a greater part than it is now if we are\n\nto expand those key sectors essential to our long term\n\ncompetitiveness. It is to build an active partnership with industry that we\n\nare reforming CSIRO and university laboratories to make\n\nbetter use of their enormous reserves of talent.\n\nWe want to see Australian industry take a greater role in\n\ndirect research spending and in supporting Australian\n\nresearchers so that those who have made a world-class\n\ne breakthrough with world-wide commercial application are not\n\nforced, as they have been too often in the past, to look\n\noverseas to develop their findings.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nFor all these reasons, the sponsors of this new Centre are\n\nto be especially congratulated.\n\nThe Centre has a number of major sponsors from Australian\n\nindustry but I am sure I speak for the Centre when I say\n\nit would be keen to hear from other companies as potential\n\nsponsors.\n\ne, I pay tribute to my ministerial colleague, Barry Jones, who\n\nI has been committed to this project from the start, and I\n\ncongratulate Dr Michael Gore and his colleagues who brought\n\nto the Centre the skills and enthusiasm of Questacon.\n\nf But perhaps more than anyone else, the Government and\n\nbusiness community of Japan deserve our most sincere thanks.\n\ne Their generous financial contribution provided about half\n\nthe total construction costs of this Centre, which makes it\n\na very substantial Bicentennial gift indeed.\n\nSo it is appropriate too that the grounds of the Ceintre will\n\nnge be adorned by some of the 1200 1cherry trees which were also\n\ngiven to Australia by Japan to mark our Bicentenary. 3723"
