        "text": "Stefan Bradley\n\nTHERE was spectacular science and free play, at an event for families at the Gippsland Regional Sports Complex (GRSC) in Sale last Saturday.\n\nQuestacon’s Science Circus has been touring Gippsland to visit local primary schools in recent weeks, as well as holding ‘Questacon Pop-Up Science Centre’ events.\n\nOn Saturday, it was Sale’s turn.\n\nAll 2500 free tickets for the Sale Pop-Up Science Centre were booked out, filling the GRSC with children and families excited to try more than 30 hands-on science exhibits and watch unforgettable shows. The fun began at 10am and finished at 4pm, with the largest crowds showing up around 11am.\n\nBrent Brosnan, one of the Science Circus crew members, told the Gippsland Times the crew paid a visit to Sale Primary School (545) and made other recent stops in the region, including Stratford, Longford, Cann River and Mallacoota. Plans for other stops were in Morwell, Traralgon and Leongatha.\n\n“Everywhere that we can we try to go as regional as possible,” he said.\n\n“I’m loving (Wellington) so much, it’s a beautiful area.”\n\nAt the pop-up centres, the crew runs about 10 shows throughout the day to wow kids with science. They’ve experimented with fire, explosions and ‘magic vs science’. Mr Brosnan’s own show is about liquid nitrogen, and the crew runs about 10 of these shows a day that last about 15 minutes each.\n\n“I’m freezing things as much as I can, showing the reaction between liquid nitrogen and water,” Mr Brosnan said.\n\n“I make bubbles out of liquid nitrogen. I put it into a kettle and make things explode.\n\n“It’s very fun and I finish with a big explosion at the end … I won’t give away the ending. It’s very fun seeing the reactions.”\n\nMr Brosnan said the crew and the kids are just as enthusiastic as each other about the shows.\n\n“I love getting to do it. Seeing the look on a kid’s face when they realise something, when they have a ‘eureka’ moment and get excited about this,” he said.\n\n“All we’re trying to do is just get people excited about science and STEM in general and push people towards those sorts of careers if that’s something they want to do.\n\n“We just like to show them how accessible and how fun science can be.”\n\nWith the on-hand exhibits, participants could freeze their shadow, test reflexes, see how fast they can really throw, and even explore angular momentum by spinning themselves silly. The Questacon crew was there to help, but also encourage people to experiment on their own.\n\nScience Circus Coordinator, Finn Gordon said he was excited that Questacon was in Gippsland to provide opportunities for the community to engage with STEM.\n\n“Science and technology play a huge part in our daily lives and the pop-up science centre offers the whole community an opportunity to get hands-on and explore science for themselves,” he said.\n\nThe Pop-Up Science Centre will be in Morwell tomorrow (February 24) and Leongatha on Saturday, March 2. Head to questacon.edu.au for more information.\n\nSince 1985, the Questacon Science Circus has inspired more than three million people through interactive science shows, with over 700 visits to towns and communities, including 110 remote Indigenous communities."
