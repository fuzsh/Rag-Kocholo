        "text": "Featuring groundbreaking new science and technology, Questacon’s famous Earthquake House reopens to the public on Friday 19 July.\n\nSimulated earthquakes have been synonymous with Questacon since 1988, while many Canberrans will remember the original Earthquake House from 2001 to 2014.\n\nNow, Questacon is shaking things up with a new educational experience for the next generation of future seismologists.\n\n“The return of Earthquake House marks a pivotal moment for Questacon as it not only reconnects us with our rich history but also introduces a thrilling new encounter featuring seismic science for today’s audiences” said Questacon Director Jo White.\n\nEarthquake House invites visitors into a typical suburban home to experience a simulated earthquake in which the room shakes twice. The first is just a small tremor that shakes the room just a little. The second wave is a simulated earthquake that registers a 5.8 magnitude. Again, there are no concerns for those in the simulation, but you can imagine that a tremor like that would rattle you if it wasn’t expected.\n\nThere is also a playlist featuring some very appropriate titles, including Boom! Shake the Room by DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince, Shake it Off by Taylor Swift, You Shook Me All Night Long by AC/DC and more.\n\nHead of Geoscience Australia’s Community Safety Branch Dr John Dawson said the Earthquake House illustrates the impact of earthquakes that can and do occur in Australia.\n\n“On average we experience 4 to 5 potentially damaging earthquakes every year in Australia, such as the magnitude 5.9 earthquake near the town of Rawson Victoria in 2021,” Dr Dawson said.\n\n“It is important for Australians to understand earthquakes and what to do in the event they experience one."
