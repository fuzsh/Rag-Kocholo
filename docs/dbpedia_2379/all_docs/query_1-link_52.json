        "text": "Science is not static. It’s an exciting, ever-evolving field that impacts every aspect of our everyday lives and that will drive incredible social change over the upcoming decades. The general public’s understanding of science should be likewise alive. New concepts, as we discover them, should find their way into classrooms and general media so that people can make informed personal, political, and business decisions. That’s why outreach is an important part of what we do at TMOS.\n\nOut outreach program is an opportunity to share our expertise in physics, engineering and meta-optics with the wider community. Our committee members come from all nodes, allowing us to interact with our community across the country, forming relationships with schools and educational systems. By bringing our knowledge and resources to the classroom, not only are we working to increase interest in STEM, and physics in particular, we are helping our committee members grow as science communicators and educators while getting word of our research out there.\n\nOur program has been designed to entertain and engage young Australians, encouraging them to be future leaders and innovators in STEM careers. Through our workshops, we introduce audiences to the science behind the optics and help them understand the new industrial revolution, their future, Industry 4.0\n\nWe have designed three new workshops that address key content descriptors from the Australian National Curriculum and include hands-on demonstrations and real-life examples to build connections between the learning material and everyday life to solidify the concepts being taught. Each workshop is aimed at Year 5 primary school students, offering an alternate learning opportunity for students to better engage with the content."
