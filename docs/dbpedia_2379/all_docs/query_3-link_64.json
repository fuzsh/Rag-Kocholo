        "text": "1. Watch Government In Action\n\nCanberra is the capital city of Australia and the seat of the nation's government, making it a popular destination for diplomats and tourists alike. The stunning Parliament House, which acts as a focal point for the city as well as being the political center of Australia, was completed in 1988 by decree of Queen Elizabeth II. Within this governmental area you can also find the National Portrait Gallery, High Court of Australia, and the National Library. Tours of the Parliament House are available upon request, though visitors are free to stroll the grounds or take in one of the many adjacent museums.\n\n2. Venture Into The Unknown\n\nSituated at the base of Black Mountain, the Australian National Botanic Gardens feature many walking trails, sprawling lawns, waterfalls, and a cafe for visitors to enjoy the natural scenery of Canberra. These gardens also have the largest collection of native flora and fauna in all of Australia. Since around 80% of Australia's wildlife is unique to the Australian continent, thousands of visitors flock to this oasis for a true inside look at some of the world's most unusual plants and animals. In the summer season the Botanic Gardens also put on several community concerts and other performances, which are free to the public.\n\n3. Put On Your Thinking Cap\n\nQuestacon, or the National Science and Technology Center, is one of the largest interactive exploration places in all of Australia. The center is home to 200 different exhibits focusing on subjects such as chemistry, robotics, biology, and engineering. Questacon is very proactive when it comes to educating future generations in applicable STEM fields. As such, they have partnered with many different schools in the surrounding Canberra neighborhoods to create fun field trips, extracurricular classes, and exploration areas for young learners.\n\n4. Facing The Future\n\nThe first Europeans to visit the Australian continent came at the end of the 19th century, though the indigenous aboriginal people had already lived there for thousands of years. Recent conflicts between the two groups have led towards recent efforts at reconciliation to create a more diverse and inclusive view of what it means to be Australian. You can see the fruit of these efforts at Reconciliation Place, where outdoor sculptures have been placed around Canberra city center dedicated towards bridging the gaps between these two cultural identities.\n\n5. Taking In The View\n\nFor some truly incredible views of Canberra, take a hike up to the summit of Black Mountain and visit Telstra Tower. The tower is named after Australia's largest telecommunications company and is 195 meters high. At the observation deck you can get some incredible 360-degree views of the Parliament House below, and the Cork Tree plantation. The Telstra Tower platform also features a rotating restaurant and souvenir shop for those looking to prolong their visit and remember their trip to Canberra for years to come."
