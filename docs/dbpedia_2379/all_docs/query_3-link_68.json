With a number of distinguished guests including Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery, Paul Scully MP, Fiona Phillips MP and Sharon Bird MP in attendance the event celebrated Science Space’s history with flair.\n\nFeaturing special guest Graham Durant, Director of Australia’s National Science Museum Questacon, a spectacular science performance by talented Science Space ambassadors surprised and delighted the audience.\n\nGuests were also treated to an array of innovative and high-calibre culinary treats by the newly appointed chef for UOW’s catering provider Aspire Events.\n\nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a Wollongong native who hasn’t been through the Science Space in its 30-year history. Just this year, the Science Space is on target to host 18,000 school students, out of a total of 60,000 visitors, a record number.\n\nBe sure to check out the fantastic media coverage we received as well as our event photo album to see the full night.\n\nMEDIA\n\nClick the images below to view the full articles.\n\nEVENT ALBUM\n\nClick the image below to view the full album."
