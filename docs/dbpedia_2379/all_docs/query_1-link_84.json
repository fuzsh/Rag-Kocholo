        "text": "UNSW SMaRT Centre Director, Professor Veena Sahajwalla features in a new exhibit at Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre located in Canberra.\n\nVeena is one of a number of subjects for the Women in STEM exhibit which showcases portraits and inspirations from leading female leaders in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths).\n\nQuestacon reached out to Veena and SMaRT because \"it is great to be able to have role models like yourself on display in our centre'\" and because \"increasing representation is an important part of our ongoing initiatives to improve outcomes for women and girls in STEM fields\".\n\n\"Weâ€™re confident that our visitors will find that your image and quote inspiring.\"\n\nVeena's quote says: \"If someone says 'you can't do that', I wonder why do they think that? Then I think 'of course we can, we just need to figure out a way'.\"\n\nThe exhibit is physical only at this stage with no current online reference by Questacon."
