        "text": "Questacon was the boys’ favourite place in Canberra. In fact we visited twice during our time in Canberra.\n\nNearly everything there is interactive and hands on and the boys tried everything!\n\nWe have a Science Centre in Queensland too but it’s nowhere near as big as Questacon and it’s lacks the wonderful presentations and shows that Questacon has. There are different shows on all day. The entrance price is worth it just for the fantastic shows you can enjoy. We saw two shows. One about physics and different ways of moving…\n\n…and one about rockets presented by a scientist from the space research institute in Kazakhstan.\n\nWe also went to a mini hands on class about balancing. The presenter talked about balance and demonstrated different balance concepts.\n\nHe then showed the children all the different activities they could try and allowed the children the freedom to move about the room trying different balancing tasks.\n\nThere’s also a play centre at Questacon. It’s meant for six year olds and younger (okay Ethan is close to that age…at least he looks it). It includes a fantastic water play section. Despite the freezing temperatures in Canberra my boys would have happily played there all day.\n\nThe boys’ other favourite exhibit at Questacon was the roller coaster ride. It’s a simulated ride where you sit in a capsule that moves in various directions as you watch a screen that makes you think you are on a roller coaster. I wasn’t sure the boys would enjoy this…I certainly didn’t…but they loved it and had us on it more than once. My problem with the ride was that you can slide right off the seat (especially in a slippery skirt when you’re so short your feet don’t properly reach the ground!!) so I had to work hard to keep both boys on the seat and not embarass myself by ending up on the floor. A challenge, let me tell you!!\n\nSo Questacon was yet another place that I would definitely enjoy on a regular basis if we lived and homeschooled in Canberra…and if the temperatures would kindly move a little higher up on the thermometer. Under 10 degrees Celcius is not my idea of pleasant."
