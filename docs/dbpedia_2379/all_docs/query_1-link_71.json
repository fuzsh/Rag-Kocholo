        "text": "The Shell Questacon Science Circus rolled into town during the same week as Far Out Science as part of their regional tour of northern NSW.\n\nThe 20-strong team spent time in local schools as well as facilitating teacher professional development workshops throughout the region. After helping us with Far Out Science too, they unpacked their huge semi trailer of SCIENCE into SportUNE for their fabulous pop-up science event over two days on Saturday 8th and Sunday 9th November.\n\n[photo of Questacon science circus truck]\n\nThis talented troupe of students are studying a Masters of Science Communication at the Australian National University (ANU). It is a one year course, of which a compulsory part is travelling Australia providing exciting science shows, school incursions and teacher professional development workshops in regional areas.\n\nA day at the Shell Questacon Science Pop Up might include balancing six giant nails on the head of another nail, escaping from rope handcuffs, tricking your brain into thinking youâ€™re staring down a hundred metre deep hole, playing with gravity, magnetism, balance, speed, flight and rotation! Visitors are also treated to part of the Questacon shop, and participating in shows that mix science with magic, fire, illusion and a lot of fun. The UNE Discovery team were proud to host a table alongside Questacon at the Lab Bench, offering our palaeontology activity Weighing Giants, which was very popular with visitors. Over 200 families visited the circus during the 2-day event."
