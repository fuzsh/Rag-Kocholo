        "text": "Marion Williams started volunteering at Questacon by accident, but 35 years later, the role is still teaching her new things and helping her stay active.\n\nThe 85-year-old former geologist started volunteering at Questacon shortly after moving to Canberra, back when the centre was still spread out across a few classrooms at Ainslie School.\n\n\"My cousin who was a teacher said 'take the kids to Questacon'. I had not heard of it before, but I loved it,\" she said.\n\n\"One of the volunteers heard me talking to my kids and said 'why don't you do it (volunteer)?'\"\n\nShe said she has always been interested in science and was happy to share that passion with her children, who also loved the regular visits.\n\n\"I am a logical person - it's much easier to work things out than learn them by heart. There's a bit of learning by heart (in science) but there's also a heck of a lot of experimental stuff.\"\n\nIn 1988, Questacon moved from the school into its new, purpose built building in the parliamentary triangle thanks to funding from the Australian and Japanese governments.\n\n\"It was wonderful, it really was - very different being in a few classrooms to being in a well designed, interesting building.\"\n\n\"It had its quirks, it originally had a bit of a heat management problem due to its unique design, but everything is great now.\"\n\nThe centre features a range of interactive displays and installations which are designed to be fun for kids of all ages, while also getting them to think about the mechanics of how things work.\n\nAfter newcomers are shown the basic layout of the centre, they on to the exhibits, with established volunteers talking about simple ways to explain \"complex science\".\n\nOne of Marion's favourite exhibits is the River Crossing exercise - which challenges kids to move a chicken, fox and a bag or corn to the other side of river - one at a time, The chicken can't be left alone with the corn, or it will eat it, and the fox can't be left alone with the chicken.\n\n\"It's just learning that in maths, you don't always go in a straight line, sometimes you have to go back to go forward.\"\n\nBut Marion admits she isn't exactly an authority on all aspects of science. While she is an expert on geology and has a pretty good grasp of Newtonian physics, when it comes to questions about areas outside her expertise, she is happy to refer people to other volunteers.\n\nWhen she and a friend were both looking at downsizing many years ago, they decided to donate some of their old science books to the centre.\n\nSince then, the library has continued to grow. Questacon's management has added to the collection of books, while a number of well known scientists have also donated. Some scientists, such as well knows astronomer Fred Watson have also visited for book signings.\n\nToday Marion estimates the library has about 500 books which volunteers can access to improve their knowledge. Sometimes the books even serve as inspiration for new exbibits.\n\n\"It really is a caring community - I can talk to the director, the general manager, I know people in all areas.\"\n\n\"When people have problems they are there for you, that is one of the reasons I think a lot of the people are still there.\""
