        "text": "Robyn Williams: And so back to Quantum, 1988, and an anniversary for Questacon. And I'll talk to the present director, Graham Durant.\n\nKarina Kelly: Tonight, a Quantum special as we go to the national capital for the official opening of the National Science and Technology Centre. Hello, and welcome to Quantum. As you can see tonight, we are doing something different, as are the scientists that are standing out in the rain here tonight demonstrating against cuts in science. And we'll also be telling you what this centre is all about.\n\nRobyn Williams: The opening of Questacon 30 years ago of course with the Prime Minister, as we've just heard, he got waylaid in Canberra from all these stroppy scientists. You weren't hear but did you know about what happened?\n\nGraham Durant: Not at the time, no, I was in Scotland working at the University of Glasgow. I only came over in 2003. So I've read a bit about it, but it was only recently I saw the Quantum program on the opening making a noise.\n\nRobyn Williams: Isn't it interesting that then the scientists were protesting. Now when things are much more dire in many ways, not least in America, they are fairly quiet, despite last year in 2017 the March for Science.\n\nGraham Durant: The March for Science was the only real demonstration I can think of. It's interesting enough that they wanted to start that by Questacon, and I thought there's a bit of symmetry there, but they moved away up near Parliament, which is probably the right thing to do. And yes, we do need to stand up for science, but if you want something to be effective, perhaps these days there are different ways than standing and waving placards and making a noise.\n\nRobyn Williams: Indeed. Now let's go back to the history of Questacon. Of course it started in a school hall with Mike Gore. But before that, the inspiration was in many ways Frank Oppenheimer in San Francisco in the Golden Gate Park in some very enterprising stuff which incorporated something we hadn't heard of before, the explainers, young people, you've got many explainers, who came in sometimes off the street, were transfixed by science and came to help.\n\nGraham Durant: Yes, the Exploratorium and Frank Oppenheimer's work has been so important to the growth of the science centre sector worldwide, and that growth is still going on and it's still rooted very much in the principles of hands-on science and explanations by young enthusiastic presenters. And I suppose when you've got a collection of phenomena you do need somebody who can be an intermediary and help visitors get the most out of their exploration of those particular hands-on exhibits.\n\nRobyn Williams: How have you developed the explainer on the road as well? Have you got plenty of them still?\n\nGraham Durant: Yes, it's a very important part of what we offer at Questacon, with programs like the Shell Questacon Science Circus, which has been operating now for 33 years. And what started off with volunteers from the university became a diploma and now it's a masters in science communication. And those postgraduate students run the Science Circus. So each year we've got this cohort of 16 bright shiny young science communicators who take their enthusiasm out on the road. In the centre we have a mix of gallery assistants and volunteers, and we have still volunteers who were around at the time Questacon first opened in Ainslie Primary School, and we've got some young school student volunteers, and each year we train a cohort of school students. But the important aspect is for them to understand a little bit about the public, understand a little bit about the science and remember how to smile and communicate. And it's that smiling and personal interaction which is really so important.\n\nRobyn Williams: In these days, in 2018 when everyone is online, how do you justify a building with stuff in it that you go and visit?\n\nGraham Durant: Firstly, the building is just a hub. It's like a bicycle wheel, without the hub, the rest of the wheel doesn't work. And so a lot of what we do is away from the building, and we do use digital media. When Questacon was founded 30 years ago, the National Science and Technology Centre, internet wasn't here and phones were underdeveloped and technologies were very different. So we've had to embrace the web, I think one of the very first science centre websites, early 1990, so we used the technology. But I think there's something fundamental about the hands-on exhibits, about the social interaction, about the visit itself, and you can't do that simply through digital media. So digital media is a great way of extending the influence, the reach of the centre, and we can do that globally so we are not constrained to Australia anymore, we can reach school students in different countries through digital connections. The trick is to find ways of using it that allow you to be true to your principles of hands-on interaction, experiential learning. So the danger is you suddenly try and become a news program for science, which we are not set up to be and there are other organisations better at doing that than we are. So if we just focus on creating good interactive stuff online and using it to extend our existing programs, I think that's a reasonable way of embracing the technologies. But of course they are rapidly changing and you have to adapt and keep moving with the times.\n\nRobyn Williams: Indeed. So what do your young visitors say, the kids who come in and look around, when you talk to them, how do they respond?\n\nGraham Durant: Well, the great thing is they keep coming, and they are coming in significant numbers. And some of the experiences are novel. The first time you see, let's say, a demonstration of superconductivity, it's magical. There are things that you remember your entire life. It could be as simple as a hydrogen balloon exploding. I can still remember the very first one I saw. So those memories do stick with people through their lifetimes, and they keep coming back at different times with a different context and a different level of understanding.\n\nBut it's interesting, we see a huge amount of family interaction and that's great to see, because you're bonding families, learning together, having fun together, and that's really important, and the children obviously do that. Interestingly enough they tend to steer away from the screen-based exhibits. I think it's probably because there's so many screens in their lives at school and at home, to actually get out and manipulate things with their hands and use their hands and their brains, their ears, their eyes, sometimes their noses, coordinated experiential learning I think is really important. Of course you still go around the centre and you see one or two youngsters clicking away on their mobile phones, but generally they are charging around, engaged with what's going on and what we are offering them, and I think from that I take great comfort in the fact that we are creating something that is relevant, that's useful, it's authentic in so far as we are offering real phenomena that they can interact with, and I think that's important.\n\nBob Hawke: Our bicentenary has provided a magnificent opportunity, not only for celebration but for more enduring achievements which long after 1988 has entered the history books will be appreciated by future generations of Australians. The National Science and Technology Centre is just such a project; innovative, important and enduring.\n\nRobyn Williams: What about the fact that while all this is going on, both what you do, the science centres do around the country, and also the internet which we've mentioned, the standards seem to be slipping, those famous league tables we see in the papers every now and then, how young people's, comparatively speaking, performance is going down.\n\nGraham Durant: Yes, it is a cause for concern, I'll use the word deliberately, it is a cause for concern because we want youngsters to have the best opportunities they can to be the best they can be. But there are many factors that influence how people learn. If you think about a person's lifetime, they probably spend about 18% of that in school learning, which means there's 82% of their life where they are not in school learning. So learning to learn I think is the critical key, and what schools really should be focusing on is training people to think and giving them that love of learning, because a lot of the other stuff, the knowledge stuff, although it's important as a foundation for future learning, nevertheless it fills the curriculum up and we end up training people to pass exams and we are not really giving the youngsters the skills that they need alongside the knowledge that they need, the foundation knowledge.\n\nSo I think there are other issues about the problem of uptake of STEM. You also need job pull, and the job pull is a bit of a problem. And although we get report after report saying we need more STEM graduates in certain disciplines, actually the jobs are hard to find for recent graduates. And once you get into a career you can build it, but it's not easy. So it's not very attractive for youngsters to put in all the effort. And to actually learn science, technology, engineering, maths, medicine, it's hard work. Work requires motivation, so in some cases it could be a 'tiger mother' encouraging a youngster to keep going for different reasons, or it could be a teacher really inspiring the youngsters to get going or a family member, or it could be job pull. But generally the job pull I think is the weaker part of the equation at the moment.\n\nRobyn Williams: 2018, you celebrate…I suppose the actual date is in November, how are you going to celebrate, what are you going to do, how are you going to change?\n\nGraham Durant: Well, at 30 years it's a great time to reflect on everything that has been achieved to date and to reset the organisation for the next 30 years. So what we are going to do is firstly acknowledge the work to date, the contributions of the various founders, the Japanese government and business communities who invested significantly in the building. The fact that Questacon in that 30 years has attracted nearly 12 million visitors, it's generated an enormous amount of money for the ACT tourism economy. I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation the other day and I got it very close to $1 billion. So that's a pretty substantial contribution for tourism alone.\n\nThen on top of that you've got the value-ad of developing young minds and brains, the human capital development which is very, very hard to quantify, almost impossible to put a figure on because it's not a single visit to Questacon that makes a difference, it's the whole of the life experience that does make the difference there. But importantly the contribution Questacon has made internationally, and we do that through the work of the Science Circus. I've started using 'Science Circus diplomacy' as a term recently because the graduates who run the Science Circus after graduation have now worked in 58 different countries. The model we've developed touring around Australia of ultraportable exhibits, simple demonstrations using humble materials and enthusiastic presenters works in many, many different settings, whether it's in Africa, whether it's in Asia.\n\nThe legacy of the founding of Questacon is literally global, so it has created an organisation that not only is important within Canberra alongside the other national cultural institutions, it reaches out across Australia into regional and remote communities, taking experiences into those communities, it also reaches out around the world into many countries. And it's turned out that Questacon now is one of the…it's not one of the biggest science centres by any means but it's one of the most influential. And if I can go back to the impact of the Science Circus, I was over in China recently and the chair of the conference I was speaking at credited the ANU Questacon Science Circus as being the basis for their outreach program from the China Science and Technology Museum. We have one big truck, they have 1,447 trucks. Last year they interacted in China with 0.206 billion people, they travelled 32 million km. So they've taken a model from Australia and operated it in China the way that only the Chinese can, but it shows the importance of the development over a number of years creating models that others can take up, and I think Questacon has always done that.\n\nBob Hawke: There is of course, as you know, only a small number of national institutions deemed worthy of location here in the Parliamentary Triangle. The decision to place the National Science and Technology Centre amongst these premier institutions in this area reflects the very high priority the government attaches to it. I pay tribute to my ministerial colleague Barry Jones who has been committed to this project from the start, and I congratulate Dr Michael Gore and his colleagues who brought to the centre the skills and the enthusiasm of Questacon.\n\nRobyn Williams: What the Prime Minister said just now, about this being a turning point for Australian science, were you impressed by that?\n\nMike Gore: I think that's tremendous, I think we were all impressed by that, I think there's going to be a resurgence of science in this country, it's going to be absolutely magnificent, and we are going to help to lead it too.\n\nRobyn Williams: Yes, because lots of scientists have felt that there's been some neglect and maybe they are wondering perhaps why we should spend $20 million on a building like this at a time when perhaps CSIRO are crying out for more funds.\n\nMike Gore: I think they are all in favour, in fact I know the scientific community is all in favour of this. We must bear in mind that Australia paid only half the cost of this building, our good friends the Japanese paid the other half.\n\nRobyn Williams: I must make the point of course that the rally did say that they were there in the support of science and not demonstrating against the centre.\n\nMike Gore: The rally came to see me about a week ago before they came and they said we are very much in favour of this science centre and we don't want to do anything to upset your opening.\n\nRobyn Williams: One point, it's very glamorous, it's high-tech, do you think it takes you too far away from your roots?\n\nMike Gore: Oh no, no, we'll keep our roots, we'll keep the simplicity that Questacon started. We know what the public have said to us, we know what they like, we'll keep to that.\n\nRobyn Williams: And you'll keep not in the director's office but hands-on yourself?\n\nMike Gore: Oh you better believe it!\n\nRobyn Williams: Well, Mike Gore, my congratulations.\n\nMike Gore: Thanks Robyn.\n\nRobyn Williams: All the very best.\n\nMike Gore: Thanks for joining us this evening."
