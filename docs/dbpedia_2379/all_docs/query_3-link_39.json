        "text": "To Infinity and Beyond - Questacon blasts off to Moreton Bay\n\nPublished 02 July 2024\n\nGet ready to take one giant leap for mankind as City of Moreton Bay welcomes the interactive exhibition Australia in Space, set to land at Redcliffe Museum this August.\n\nThis interstellar exhibition from the National Science and Technology Centre, Questacon, explores Australia’s unique contributions to space travel, technology, and its practical uses in everyday life.\n\nMayor Peter Flannery said the sky’s no longer the limit for City of Moreton Bay with the arrival of this free hands-on exhibition that’s fun for the whole family from 10 August to 3 November.\n\n“Some of us are old enough to have lived through the moon landing and were inspired by the vital role Australia played through our observatory in Parkes, NSW,” he said.\n\n“Our wonders have now become a reality as we can explore Australia’s history and contemporary excellence in space right here in Moreton Bay thanks to Questacon.\n\n“This August, we have the opportunity to experience first-hand how space exploration pushes the limits of ingenuity and technology, how Australia plays a vital role in the global space community, and how space technology is changing how we live, learn and work.\n\n“So, plan to visit this hands-on exhibition and discover Australia’s inspiring contributions to the space sector. I guarantee you will be amazed.”\n\nHead to Redcliffe Museum to take part in just some of the exhibition’s hands-on highlights:\n\nLearn from Astrophysicist Professor Dr Tamara Davis who will talk on The Dark Side of the Moon, and the University of Queensland’s Science Troupe conducting science experiments and demos on 10 August.\n\nTackle space junk cooperatively in a computer game based on real Australian technology.\n\nPilot a simulated Mars rover.\n\nUse a virtual telescope to ‘link up’ with iconic deep space missions that Australia supports.\n\nTake part in a laser-based puzzle game that teaches players how satellites allow over-the-horizon communication.\n\nBuild a “Roo-ver”, Australia-themed Lunar Rover souvenir, activated from 10 August.\n\nCreate and colour your “Orbit satellite” and unique “space invaders” in the Museum’s Imaginarium.\n\nBe inspired by the story of our Aussie astronaut, Katherine Bennell-Pegg, and watch informational videos from the Australian Space Agency on various career paths in space exploration.\n\nLearn how Australia’s location and expertise give us a unique advantage in space operations, benefiting deep space exploration and our lives here on Earth.\n\nVisit the night sky cave and immerse yourself in watching the galaxies."
