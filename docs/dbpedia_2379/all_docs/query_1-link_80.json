        "text": "Community venues and local schools will be overflowing with exciting, hands-on science when the Shell Science Circus and their colourful semi-trailer roll into towns through Queensland in November to stage public exhibitions of their ‘pop-up’ science centre.\n\nVisitors of all ages can enjoy over 40 interactive science exhibits and watch spectacular science shows as Science Circus presenters hold fire in their hands, lie on a bed of nails and levitate beach balls.\n\nThe Science Circus comprises 15 postgraduate students studying a Master of Science Communication Outreach at The Australian National University. The students spend three months visiting communities all over Australia to engage people with science and technology.\n\nThis year, the Science Circus is celebrating 30 years on the road.\n\nThe Shell Questacon Science Circus is a proud initiative of Shell, The Australian National University and Questacon – The National Science and Technology Centre."
