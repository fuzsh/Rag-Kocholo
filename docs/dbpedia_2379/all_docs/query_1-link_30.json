        "text": "Thank you Troels Jacobsen and Anders Riel M√ºller ÏÜ°Ïó∞Ï§Ä Universitetet i Stavanger (UiS) for connecting two of the region‚Äôs ü¶Ñ, Lene R√∏kke Mathisen Haugesund kommune and Helene Eiliott Stavanger kommune as well as Rogaland fylkeskommune with the ECIU network and the challenge-based approach to research and innovation. It was really inspiring to hear how what Lene and Helene already do locally reasonates across the EU (and California!), and how we can join forces to scale this more life-creating way of developing societies! What I bring with me: üßòüèΩ‚ôÄÔ∏èPublic engagement covers a huge range of actions, from participating in elections to providing input to planning processes, to choosing to keep a distance. Absencing is also public engagement, but we have no way of accounting for it. Good public engagement fosters presencing. It takes time, purpose and commitment. üåºü§óGood public engagement is about softening structures, making the public space open and accessible to everyone, connecting from the heart. It is about creating life, belonging and attachment. ü•êüåªMeaningful connection and relationships are built over croissants and jazz music, not post-it notes. Having experienced the way ECIU researchers engage us, stakeholders, with their science, meeting us where we are and having a conversation with us, there is no going back to post-it notes. üßêüí≠ We need more philosophers to think the big questions in city and society development. Being operational and in fire fighting mode certainly appeals to politicians who want to be seen as people who get stuff done but is not allowing time for the municipalities to listen in and observe to what citizens actually need as their lives evolve.\n\nPosting this a bit later, but truly grateful for the opportunity to present my pre-doctoral research at #RIDOC 2023. Special thanks to the respected session moderators and commentators for their invaluable insights. Commendations to the conference organizers for maintaining a high standard of quality. My presentation, \"Predictive Policing and Law Enforcement Authorities: A New EU Perspective,\" addressed the classification of predictive policing systems as high-risk systems within the #AIact. It's crucial to note that this classification was part of the original proposal; subsequent amendments altered this classification and prohibited the practice within the #AIact. I underscored the importance of strict criteria, emphasizing data quality, transparency, and accuracy as critical points of regulation for predictive policing systems within the proposed framework. Advocating for the classification of predictive policing systems as high-risk, the assertion is that, with rigorous oversight, they can effectively address critical points of regulation. Notably, the conclusion of the trialogue procedure coincided with my presentation. I eagerly anticipate how my proposals align with the finalized draft, expected by the end of January. I hope that the forthcoming publication of the paper in Croatian will serve to shed light on the nuances of AI and criminal law regulation, fostering academic and public discourse in the Republic of Croatia. Navigating the complexities of researching the intersection of criminal procedure law and AI is a formidable challenge, particularly in the face of constant changes in the legal landscape. #RIDOC2023 #AIRegulation #PredictivePolicing #Criminalprocedure\n\nThe VARCITIES - Green Cities are Healthier Cities pilot site Gzira, celebrated green spaces in urban environments with the launch of the Go Nature Game, developed by our partners Darttek Ltd. I was privileged to support the team on behalf of Inlecom Commercial Pathways in defining a path to commercialisation, and preparing patents for filing. INLECOM is leading out on the exploitation of innovative Nature Based solutions to climate change. How do you develop a new product or service that can support NbS? Then find a route to market, and a business model to support it long term. Is an interesting space and requires out of the box thinking as nature based solutions are an emerging and fast evolving market. These solutions are often smart emerging technologies, and digital twin solutions that can inform decision making and support new options and citizen centric solutions to nature based issues such as biodiversity, clean air and temperature in urban environments. Well done to the team in Eurac Research for guiding this project and our partners ISOCARP - International Society of City and Regional Planners Crowdhelix Sensedge Technologies IES Ltd. Prospect Institute, as well as all the other city partners involved.\n\nHow do we, as researchers, impact the research? What are the biases in your approach that you can work on neutralising? In which stages of the research process can we integrate reflexivity? Which aspects of subjectivity can be viewed as beneficial/valuable? How do we deal with what we do not know? If you are interested in this topic, join us in Workshop 2: Self-Reflexivity as a Skill to Support Young Researchers in Bridging Theory and Practice: Innovations in Urban Planning Communication\" at the AESOP Young Academic Conference. üè¢ Where: Room 2.2.1, Building 2, Leonardo Campus ‚è≤ When: 09:30‚Äì13:00, March 22 üõÑ Objective: to help participants reflect on areas of their personal and collaborative work, where reflexivity can help them be more socially and epistemologically responsible. I would like to say thanks to my colleague Aamina Hashmat, our collaborators and discussants: Farah Makki, Beatrice Maria Bell√®, Giada Casarin, PhD, Dimitra Xidous, Carolina Pacchi and AESOP YA 2024 Local Organizing Committee, which is led by Abdallah Jreij, Dafni Riga, Danila Saulino."
