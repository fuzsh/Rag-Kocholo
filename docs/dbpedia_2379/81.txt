Questacon, the national science and technology centre in Canberra, has reported record visitor numbers for the first four months of this year.

Almost 115,000 people have visited since January, up 22 per cent on the same period last year.

Questacon's Kate Thomas says part of the success can be attributed to a new exhibition that will be a permanent feature.

"Anecdotally, a lot of this has to do with 'Mini Q', a new exhibition that opened in December last year, that's a whole new target audience for us, for kids zero to six-years-old," she said.

"It's just been so popular that our visitor numbers, our membership numbers, have gone through the roof."
