The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a series of science fiction/comedy franchise created by English author Douglas Adams. The series started out as a radio broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, but was then adapted into a series of novels as well as a TV series, stage plays, comic books, a computer game and a 2005 movie. The novels sold 15 million copies during Adams’ lifetime.

The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy book series began with the title novel in 1979. The “trilogy” would go on to last five books, plus one more written by Eoin Colfer in 2009.
