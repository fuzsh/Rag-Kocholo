Part 1: The Mundane Beginning The novel begins on Earth, where an ordinary human named Arthur Dent faces the demolition of his house to make way for a bypass. Just as his home is about to be destroyed, his friend Ford Prefect arrives. Ford, it turns out, is an alien researcher for the titular “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” a galactic encyclopedia for travelers.

Ford convinces Arthur to join him in hitchhiking onto a passing spaceship, the Vogon constructor ship that is demolishing Earth. The Vogons are bureaucratic and indifferent, and they destroy Earth to make space for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur and Ford are saved from the vacuum of space when they’re picked up by the stolen ship “Heart of Gold,” piloted by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the eccentric two-headed ex-president of the Galaxy.

Part 2: A Cosmic Adventure Zaphod, Arthur, Ford, and Trillian (the only other human survivor from Earth) embark on a series of bizarre and nonsensical adventures across the universe. They encounter the improbability-driven ship, visit the planet Magrathea (known for building custom planets for the ultra-rich), and uncover the true purpose of the Earth: a supercomputer designed to calculate the meaning of life.

Marvin, a chronically depressed robot, joins the group as well. Along the way, they encounter various eccentric characters, including the paranoid android, a planet full of shoe-obsessed creatures, and the enigmatic “Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.”

Part 3: The Quest for the Ultimate Question The characters’ journey culminates on the planet Magrathea, where they discover that the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is the number 42. However, the question itself is unknown. The group learns that a race of hyper-intelligent beings had built Earth to calculate this question, but it was destroyed before it could finish.

Zaphod, driven by his curiosity and desire to understand his own past, activates a mysterious device that transports him into a different dimension. He leaves the others to continue their quest for the ultimate question.

Part 4: A Philosophical Conclusion The novel concludes with Arthur and Ford hitchhiking onto another spaceship, leaving the story’s resolution open-ended. The book’s tone is whimsically philosophical, often poking fun at human foibles, bureaucracy, and the absurdities of life.
