Douglas Adams is best-known as the author of the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy, a quirky comedy charting the intergalactic travels of Arthur Dent following the unexpected demolition of Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Beginning life as a drama for BBC Radio 4, it has since been transformed into internationally bestselling novels -- nonsensically called 'a trilogy in five parts'.

The inscription on his memorial is sometimes difficult to rad, but the grave is easily recognisable by the pot of pens in front.
