        "text": "Off the Map\n\nby Trish Doller\n\nSeries: Beck Sisters #3\n\nSetting: Ireland\n\nGenres: Fiction / Romance / Contemporary\n\nPublished on March 7, 2023\n\nPages: 272\n\nFormat: eBook Source: Library\n\nTrish Doller's idyllic romance Off the Map proves sometimes a wrong turn can lead to the exact right destination.\n\nOn the road to love, you don't need a GPS...\n\nCarla Black’s life motto is “here for a good time, not for a long time.” She’s been traveling the world on her own in her vintage Jeep Wrangler for nearly a decade, stopping only long enough to replenish her adventure fund. She doesn’t do love and she doesn’t ever go home.\n\nEamon Sullivan is a modern-day cartographer who creates digital maps. His work helps people find their way, but he’s the one who’s lost his sense of direction. He’s unhappy at work, recently dumped, and his one big dream is stalled out—literally.\n\nFate throws them together when Carla arrives in Dublin for her best friend’s wedding and Eamon is tasked with picking her up from the airport. But what should be a simple drive across Ireland quickly becomes complicated with chemistry-filled detours, unexpected feelings, and a chance at love - if only they choose it.\n\nThis has become one of my favorite contemporary series. Each book can stand alone but this one especially refers back to events from the previous books so you will get the references more if you have read the whole series.\n\nThis author is just such a good writer. Her storytelling draws you in and makes you feel like you are a part of the story.\n\nIn this book Carla has been pushing aside issues with her family in order to travel around the world. Eamon has been taking on all the problems of his family and never mentioning his dream to travel. When they meet they each see the part of themselves that they were hiding. Holding up this mirror to their lives forces them to confront how they have been living. What changes do they need to make in order to build the best life for themselves and their families?\n\nBesides, how could I not love it when there is this quote?\n\n“Well, then I hope Gaiman, Adams, and Pratchett meet with your approval, because the first book I would shelve is Good Omens, followed immediately by The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and the remainder of the bookcase would be needed for the Discworld series, because I own the entire collection.”\n\nThat whole quote is exactly what I think.\n\nAnd as always there are bonus points for opinionated old ladies.\n\n“You don’t mind living here with an old lady who’s not your kin? What if you want to get married and have kids in this house? I do Zumba. I might be around awhile yet.”"
