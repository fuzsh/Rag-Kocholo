        "text": "In the fantastical world of medicine, doctors are galavanting around saving lives in the nick of time… or not. Maybe being a doctor is less glamorous than glorified Medical Dramas may suggest. Perhaps, for the newly initiated, the countless sleepless nights on call or mean residents demanding tasks at a dizzying pace, being a doctor is harder than one could imagine. The Devil Wears Scrubs provides a humorous satirical glimpse into the misadventures of a green intern, Jane McGill, as she attempts to navigate the dizzying pace of hospitals and the profession of saving lives. Jane is metaphorically slapped across the face with reality on her first day at County Hospital; she knows nothing and will do everything wrong. It does not help that Jane was assigned under Dr. Alyssa Morgan, who seems to leave out important instructions and make Jane’s life all the harder. As Jane navigates her new hectic environment, McFadden’s humor and satire make this novel about the grueling nature of the medical field largely entertaining.\n\nTo be honest, I was skeptical, somewhat expecting a medical supernatural romance, and based on the summary and title, one could infer worse. I judged the book by the cover. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The book flows seamlessly, fast-paced, witty, and entertaining. It made me laugh a great deal with the subtlety of the humor and satire and the quick remarks of the characters. Jane is a compelling protagonist who makes a lot of mistakes and faces dire consequences.\n\nWhile I enjoyed this book greatly, don’t expect anything too deep. The characters are shallow, the plot not much to fawn about, and the endless loose ends at the end. All of these reasons may seem to discount the potential of this book, but The Devil Wears Scrubs was never intended to be deep; it is supposed to be lighthearted, witty, and entertaining. So if you go into the book expecting depth, save yourself the time, and set it down, but if you want a good-natured laugh at the misfortune of another, written in a satirical tone, then by all means pick up this book right now.\n\nIf you consider yourself an experienced reader, you can probably state that there are barely a few books in this world that can touch your heart. You went through hundreds of human fates written on thousands of pages; you can easily predict the plots of love stories or detective novels; you can easily identify what figurative devices the author used here and there to make you feel sad, hopeful or amused. You feel so confident and think that nothing in the literature world can surprise you anymore, but then… you open this book, A Man Called Ove by the Swedish author Fredrik Backman. The main character has nothing to do with standardized cliche characters that we’re used to. It’s an old grumpy man called Ove, who believes that nobody in this world knows how to do their job anymore, but instead everybody tries to get more money for less effort. Not only is he deeply convinced in this, he also never skips a chance to remind this to everybody he meets and to inform them as well which rules they have broken and which lessons they have never learnt. He lives all alone, even his wife has left him, and from knowing Ove for about 50 pages we think we know why. But then the curtain opens for the readers, and we learn a beautiful and tragic story of Ove and his wife Sonja. Two absolutely different personalities, who tied themselves together for life with bonds of love, patience, understanding and selflessness. But now Sonja is gone, she’s gone forever and Ove doesn’t see any sense in life anymore. He tries to commit a suicide several times to reunite with Sonja, but all of his attempts fail once the new neighbors move into the house next to Ove’s. An absolutely clumsy IT-specialist Patrick, his pregnant Iranian wife Parvaneh and two of their daughters change his life and become a barrier for all his pessimistic plans. Unexpectedly and against Ove’s will, he rescues a cat and becomes his owner; takes Patrick to the hospital by his precious car Saab; helps a teenager Adrian to fix a bike for the girl that he likes; lets a homosexual barista, who was kicked out of the house by his very conservative father, stay over; fights for Rune, the man who’s been his main opponent the entire life, against Men In White Shirts; teaches Parvaneh driving a car and buys an iPad for her older daughter. Even though he denies it, Ove becomes friends with the entire neighborhood, remaining just as grumpy, rude and straightforward as he’s always been. One day he almost dies and that puts an end for his attempts to get to Heaven prematurely. He finally realizes that there is life after death (after Sonja’s death) and there is always something to fight for.\n\nAn amazing book that will make you laugh and cry. Ove’s sassiness and barbed character will pull up a smile on the readers faces and his endless loyalty to Soja will move even the biggest skeptics.The characters are bright and strong individuals that follow their principles and show us the world of their beliefs, so different, but never false. This novel teaches us the importance of friendship and helping each other. It shows us that even in the darkest times of life we can find light in people around us.\n\nReviewer Grade: 12\n\nDirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency is a story about love, loss, stuck couches, time travel, bad magic tricks, and the beginning of everything. It's an examination of death, life, conscious, and missing cats. But mostly, it's about a detective agency that does no detective work, and the people that get roped into it.\n\nIt would be very hard for me to describe the plot of Dirk Gently's Detective Agency. It's a book that's highly based on time travel, and this is fully taken advantage of in the novel. Things happen out of order, and it doesn't follow the protagonists journey through time. Rather, the reader and the characters are forced to piece everything together one strange moment at a time. I had to read this book, reread the ending again, then cave and read Wikipedia before every piece fell into place. This is a book that needs to be read more than once. The question is if it's worth it. I feel that it is!\n\nThis book exhibits some of the best of Douglas Adams: nonsensical stories, quirky characters, silly syntax, and an emphasis on the absurd. I especially love how are the characters are connected, by circumstance or otherwise. I like the protagonist is confused all the time, because that made him very relatable over the course of the story. The story managed to be both extremely funny and heart wrenching and heartwarming in a relatively short amount of time, without too much whiplash. Every character makes you laugh while they pull at your heartstrings. Basically, everything weaves together like a quilt, whether the writing or plot or characters, to make something fun and fascinating and endlessly comfy!\n\nAll in all, this is an extremely interesting and funny book. I docked it some points because the confusing plot can detract from the story, but that's the only flaw I could find! I would recommend this to anyone who likes time travel, hilarious writing, and a real rollercoaster of a story!\n\nReviewer Grade: 12\n\nThis Body's Not Big Enough for Both of Us is a wonderfully witty Jekyll-and-Hyde-esque tale of crime, passion, and sibling squabbles. Adrian and Zooey Kimrean are twins forced to share the same body: the same brain, the same limbs, the same life. After establishing a Private Eye business to utilize Adrian's deductive analysis and Zooey's creative skills, the two are thrown into the path of a mob war. Can they learn to work together, or will their self-destructive self-sabotage spell the end for the both of them?\n\nThis book is insane. It's absolutely insane. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, plot points, and story trajectory, and I loved every minute of it. The mastery of the book comes in large part from Cantero himself, and his mastery of humor and pacing and personality. Every character, especially the two main leads, seem to explode from the page. The book acknowledges the tropes of the detective story, and a lot of it plays into it, but there are also some wonderful subversions in the simple act of giving two-dimensional characters a lot more depth than they usually warrant. Very few characters are taken for granted. Beyond that, there's a beautiful vibrancy to the dialogue, and it highlights the unique character dynamics that emerge from the story. The story takes full advantage of its goofy premise, using it for all the drama and humor and plot fodder that it can. Both the hilarity and the absolute tragedy that is the main character's situation is wonderfully balanced. The jokes about it have some of the best slapstick and back-and-forth I've seen in a book. The sorrow of it was genuinely moving, and wasn't undercut or dragged out. Finally, even the writing was wonderful. The imagery was gorgeous, the prose was moving, and the general comic air of the book make the serious parts hit that much harder.\n\nThere are some problems with the book. Yes, the wildness of the plot can detract from the mystery. Sure, the humor can be crude and the ending was pretty conflicting. But I don't care. I read this book in a straight 48-hours and I wish it could've lasted for hundreds of hours more. It's a masterclass in characterization, dialogue, humor, and out-of-the-box writing. All in all, I'd recommend this for anyone who wants detective stories, mob wars, unlikely friendships, fantastic action, and one of the most interesting sibling dynamics you'll ever see!\n\nReviewer Grade: 12\n\nJohn Dies at the End is a story on two levels. On hand hand, it's a poignant exploration of the darkness of humanity, the fear of the unknown, the tragedies of life, and the devastating realities we exist besides everyday. But also, it's about two idiots on a space drug and their strangely resilient dog.\n\nThis book should be the blueprint for every dark comedy. It isn't a needlessly tragic story with a few laughs thrown in or a joke fest that undercuts every poignant moment. It blends comedy and tragedy seamlessly, balances it perfectly, and hits it for a home run with meticulous writing and characters. This is mostly done by finding the hilarity in tragedy, specifically the tragedy of life. This book is strangely and wonderfully existential for being mostly about shadows and movie monsters, a very classic demons of a character mirrored by demons of the world. The characters in general are stellar, with so many flaws and so much cynicism but with some shining nuggets of morality and love that makes them very easy to root for.\n\nThe entire thing is a joke that takes itself seriously in the best way possible. There are horrible moments of death and gore and dehumanization, and I would definitely look up some content warnings, but it's still such a fun ride. One minute there's gruesome character deaths and existential dread and body horror and such, the next minute one of the characters need to just kill the alien larvae quickly to get to work on time. Or their dog explodes and shows up like two days later and they don't care enough to investigate that. It's a rollercoaster of mood swings, but in a good way.\n\nAll in all, I don't know how to describe this book without using far too many words. Basically, despite some anticlimactic moments and weaker plot structure, this is a perfect dark comedy. I'd recommend this to any fans of horror, humor, existential dread, nihilistic humor, and well-written alien drugs!\n\nReviewer Grade: 12\n\nWhere many spy novels explore the skill and expertise on display with fully trained spies, Spy School takes it back to basics. Ben Ripley, a normal middle school student, is chosen by the CIA to attend an academy for spies. Ben may not be the best spy there - or even in the top 90% - but he might be the only person who can stop a plot against the whole school.\n\nA great novel for young readers looking for action and comedy, Spy School is a great introduction to the spy genre. Complete with interesting characters (although not without some flat characters as well), the plot moves at a quick pace while still keeping its reader engaged and excited. Although it is the first novel in a series, it works well as a standalone. However, the series has tended to improve as it has continued, maturing with its readers, so I would say continuing to read the series is worth your while.\n\nIf you're looking for a thriller for young readers, Spy School is the book for you!\n\nThe book, \"Wrecking Ball,\" the main plot doesn't start immediately. First there are a couple of stories including a garage sale and a segment talking about how rich he would be when he grows up. When you finally get pass this entrance into the book, we can get to the beginning of the main plot. Greg Heffley and his family are initially devastated to find out that their Great Aunt Reba had died, but then they found out that she had left them a decent amount of money. This of course started to make them argue over what to do with it. Each suggested their own idea, but the mom's idea of expanding the kitchen won out despite unpopular response because she, quote on quote, was the only one who ever wrote Great Aunt Reba any Thank You cards. Nothing seemed like it could go wrong, the expansion began, and the family began to actually get excited about a bigger kitchen. But as you probably already know in these books, something goes wrong, but this time, everything goes wrong. Trash and concrete moving into the neighbors yard, toxins in the walls, and wasps getting into the house. The neighbors by this point were obviously not the agreeable type so when they found out that part of the extension was on one of the neighbors property, they had to take the extension down. The family hit down by this failure, decides that instead of improving the house, they're going to move to a new one in a new school district. Will this work out? Will Greg and Rowley stay friends? I guess you will just have to read.\n\nI liked this book because it was a new story that didn't have any similarities to the previous books like some of the other stories have. I didn't dislike this book, but it was a fairly mediocre read for me and it didn't amaze me. I chose this book because I have been reading the series since I was young, and I enjoy getting the new book in the series when a new one comes out. I would recommend this book to anyone really who likes a good easy story to read before you fall asleep at night.\n\nNate Wright is back at it again when the unexpected strikes. Mrs. Godfrey gives a difficult assignment to research a great American. Not only this, but Nate is forcefully paired up with his archenemy and helpless teacher suck-up, Gina. She isn't exactly thrilled about it either as she is afraid that being partnered up with Nate will ruin her perfect GPA. They get assigned the topic of Ben Franklin, but Nate is more concerned with who became the captains for the Fleeceball teams. Fleeceball is a version of indoor baseball that their school plays for a season every year. Luck and disaster strike when Nate finds out he was made one of the captains, but unfortunately, so has Randy Betancourt the school bully. Nate gets in trouble, as usual, and inadvertently misses the captains meeting. Nate panics and rushes to tell the coach, but all seems good when Nate looks at his team. The coach picked all good players for him, except one, the absolute worst when it comes to athleticism, Gina. Will Nate be able to meet Gina's high expectations on their project, win the Fleeceball tournament, and deal with Randy all at the same time? I guess we will just have to see if Big Nate can, \"Strike Again.\"\n\nThe reason I enjoyed this book so much was because Nate finally found an interest in something academic even if it is just one person from history. I guess this shows that he is not completely hopeless. I honestly didn't dislike any part of this book which I immensely enjoyed while reading it. The story stayed fresh and relevant, and it moved in a way that kept me reading. I picked this book just because I was at my cousin's house and needed something to read to fall asleep at night when I was younger, so I chose to read this, and I was hooked to the series ever since. This isn't one of the best books that I have read this year, but it does come fairly close.\n\nBig Nate, or Nate Wright, is a boy who has to deal with an arrogant teacher suck-up Gina, his perfect sister Ellen, who, Nate says, adults are too short-sighted to see how annoying she is, and a number of teachers including the worst one of all, Mrs. Godfrey. She apparently fails to recognize that despite his lack of knowing anything about history, or really anything else academic, that he is destined for greatness in the future. Nate feels though that at the current stage in his life, 6th grade, he can't do much about people not realizing his greatness, especially when surrounded by misguided teachers, his clueless father, or his joking best friends Francis and Teddy. Luck strikes when Nate didn't eat breakfast and one of his best friends Teddy offers him a fortune cookie. Most of the time Nate wouldn't get anything worth thinking about, but this time is different because, \"Today you will surpass all others.\" As soon as he gets this, He realizes that the only place that he will surpass all the others is at school because at home the only people he could surpass is his clueless dad and his annoying sister. Because of this, he tries every class out of the day to make it happen, causing him to land seven detentions throughout the day. Will Nate Wright be able to surpass all of the others, or will he be in detention, \"In a class by himself.\"\n\nI liked this book because Nate seems to not understand very much about what he should do in the world, so this means that he will inevitably make his own funny decisions. The only reason that I didn't like this book as much was because it was the first in the series and I just didn't feel like it was the best one out of them. I picked this book because I had already read some of the other books in the series, (I read them out of order,) and I decided that I probably should read the first one to see how the story began. This book surprised me because I had no idea what the \"origin story\" could possibly be for this kind of a character, but if I would have guessed, the story would have exceeded my expectations. I have read many books like this, this year so sadly I can't say that it is one of the best ones that I have read this year.\n\nIf you have read the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, than you know that Greg has never been much of a sports kid. From sitting inside all day playing video games to not using the bench press that he got for Christmas. He thinks that people get certain athlete genes that make them better at sports and he guesses that he didn't get many of those. Despite his hereditary roadblocks, he wants to prove himself to his dad who is continually encouraging to give sports a shot. His opportunity comes faster than he realizes when his school announces field day which would have evens like tug of war contests and sack races. This was all looking like a good chance for Greg until field day takes an unexpected turn. From being used as light weight, to being traded away by his own teacher with two other kids for one beefy kid. Greg was ready to give up, but his mom wouldn't let him. She thought he had potential to do any sport he wanted to, and with basketball tryouts coming up, she made him go. Greg was sure that he wouldn't get on any of the teams, but he got on a separate team that was started by the basketball star's father. The basketball star, Preet Patel, couldn't make it to tryouts because of a family event, so he wasn't allowed to try out for the team. He really wanted to play basketball so his father, angry about the situation, decided to start a team with himself and all of the kids who didn't make the basketball team. Greg thinks that there might be a chance that they could actually do good with Preet on their team, but disaster strikes when Preet hurts his ankle and can't play for the rest of the season. Will Greg Heffley crash and burn, or will he get his \"Big Shot.\"\n\nI neither disliked nor liked this book. I felt like it was an okay story, but not the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid book that I have ever read. I picked this book simply because I have read these books since 3rd grade, and I want to continue to read them and see which ones are the best. The part that I enjoyed most about this book was the part in the gym when Greg actually considers working out. I'm wondering if he may actually do it in the future. The part I enjoyed least about this book was the field day event. I just felt like it was a real uninteresting time filler. This book didn't surprise me at all. It was a fairly easy to predict and not one of the best books I have read this year. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this series or funny sports books."
