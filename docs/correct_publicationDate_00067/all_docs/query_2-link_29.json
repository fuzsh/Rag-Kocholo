        "text": "Author: Douglas Adams\n\nSynopsis: In this now classic saga of humorous science fiction, Douglas Adams tells us the misadventures of Arthur Dent, the only human survivor after the Earth was demolished to make way for a hyperspace highway. Dent is rescued at the last minute by his strange friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien, editor for the very peculiar electronic traveler's guide called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Together they experience the most unexpected and delirious situations as they travel through space and time, always counting on the information of dubious usefulness provided by the Guide.\n\nFrom the author's fantastic imagination emerge hilarious characters such as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the eccentric - and fugitive - President of the Galaxy; Marvin, a paranoid, depressive and sarcastic android; or Eddie, perhaps the most infuriating computer in the history of science fiction.\n\nWhile the title is usually related to the written version of it, Adams originally wrote the story as a radio comedy for the BBC and later made multiple adaptations including this written saga, a television series, a video game and a film.\n\nAfter the death of the author, a sixth volume was added to the \"trilogy of five\" written by him, written by Eoin Colfer, but as expected it did not have a great reception from the followers of the inimitable Douglas Adams.\n\nThis is one of the best-selling science fiction series in history.\n\nBook total: 6\n\nOriginal title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nOriginal language: Ingl√©s"
