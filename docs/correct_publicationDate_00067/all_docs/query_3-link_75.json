        "text": "I tend to read a lot. In previous years, one of the things I have found frustrating is forgetting which books I have already read when when hunting for my next read (especially with long series or authors with a huge number of titles). Therefore, this year I decided to keep track of the books I read. Looking back over the list, and considering how much I like to get book recommendations, I thought others might be interested in my biased and totally unprofessional opinions. It also seems like a nice non-medical year in review type exercise. So I am posting it here. Feel free to ignore. I am am sure to be back sometime soon with some resuscitation or evidence based nerdiness. Wishing you all a great New Year…\n\nI have included links to all of these books. These are Amazon affiliate links. That means that if you click the link and buy the book, I get a small amount of money. The cost to you is unchanged. You can think of it as a way to support the many costs of running First10EM, if you feel like the site deserves your support. If you are uncomfortable with that, just go to amazon yourself and search for the book. I am not trying to sell you anything (which should become obvious by the opinions I express about a lot of these books).\n\nThe Books (In the order I read them)\n\nRoyal Flash (Flashman book 2)\n\nBy George MacDonald Fraser\n\nI really like the concept of this book series: take an accurate account of history, and then re-explain the events around a single fictional character (who happens to be a lech and a buffoon). It was a good book, but I wasn’t compelled to immediately read the next book in the series (as I usually am), so it probably wasn’t great.\n\nArbitrary number score: 62\n\nBinti\n\nBy Nnedi Okorafor\n\nA reasonably interesting science fiction concept, but not good enough that I will read book 2 in the series. (Which is pretty rare for me).\n\nArbitrary number score: 11\n\nArtemis\n\nBy Andy Weir\n\nI really liked this book. It is by the author of The Martian, and not nearly as good as that book, but it is a fun science fiction novel about life and crime on a moon base.\n\nArbitrary number score: 86\n\nSix of Crows\n\nBy Leigh Bardugo\n\nI am not usually a huge reader of fantasy, but that seems to be what I bought to start this year. This was an excellent novel following a ragtag group of criminals and misfits on an impossible heist. I definitely recommend it for a fun read.\n\nArbitrary number score: 83\n\nCrooked Kingdom (Six of Crows book 2)\n\nBy Leigh Bardugo\n\nThey were double crossed in book 1. The sequel is all about revenge. Like most sequels, it isn’t quite as good as the original, but was still worth the quick read.\n\nArbitrary number score: 73\n\nThe Uncertain Art: Thoughts on a life in medicine\n\nBy Sherwin Nuland\n\nA nice collection of essays about medicine.\n\nArbitrary number score: 63\n\nThe Colour of Magic\n\nBy Terry Pratchett\n\nThis is sort of a parody of the fantasy genre. It was quite funny, but the story was also good. I will probably keep reading this series, but the fact that there are 41 books to get through is a little daunting.\n\nArbitrary number score: 77\n\nMrs. Fletcher\n\nBy Tom Perotta\n\nPart comedy, part social commentary, this was an entertaining novel about sex and relationships, based around a divorcee searching for meaning in the year after her son left home for college.\n\nArbitrary number score: 75\n\nWe Need to Talk: How to have conversations that matter\n\nBy Celeste Headlee\n\nAn excellent non-fiction exploring how we can have better conversations. I have been meaning to write a blog post about some of these ideas for a while, but for now people will just have to read the book.\n\nArbitrary number score: 78\n\nFools and Mortals\n\nBy Bernard Cornwell\n\nHistorical fiction based around Richard Shakespeare (William’s brother). Well written, but overall just an average story.\n\nArbitrary number score: 19\n\nCarve the Mark\n\nBy Veronica Roth\n\nReasonable for a day by the pool, but overall not a great book. I didn’t realise this was the same author who wrote Divergent when I picked up the book, and this is basically the same story in a different setting.\n\nArbitrary number score: 14\n\nMan’s Search of Meaning\n\nBy Viktor E Frankl\n\nAn absolutely incredible read. There is nothing light at all about this Holocaust survivor’s account of life in the concentration camps, but the insight into human nature is unparalleled.\n\nArbitrary number score: 100\n\nSevlin Ascends\n\nBy Josiah Bancroft\n\nThis was a great book for an easy read. A nice fantasy fiction about a school teacher visiting the Tower of Babylon, where everything that can go wrong does go wrong. I can’t wait for the sequel.\n\nArbitrary number score: 86\n\nWhen You are Engulfed in Flame\n\nBy David Sedaris\n\nThis collection of short essays is the first book I have read by Sedaris. They were interesting and funny. I will definitely read more Sedaris in the future.\n\nArbitrary number score: 80\n\nDo Not Say We Have Nothing\n\nBy Madeleine Thien\n\nIt took me a while to get into this book, but I ultimately loved it. It is a complex novel following an extended family through pivotal times in China’s 20th century (the cultural revolution through to the demonstrations at Tiananmen Square).\n\nArbitrary number score: 81\n\nRemote Control (Nick Stone book 1)\n\nBy Andy McNab\n\nA fairly standard action page-turner, but made more interesting by the fact that McNab really was part of the SAS, and therefore provides interesting insight into operations details. However, the not infrequent nonsensical sentence or jarring grammar made the reading less enjoyable.\n\nArbitrary number score: 41\n\nThe Design of Everyday Things\n\nBy Don Norman\n\nI love design. I love the concepts in this books, especially ideas about how design contributes to and can be used to avoid error. Overall, reads a little too much like a textbook to be super enjoyable though.\n\nArbitrary number score: 39\n\nThe Boat People\n\nBy Sharon Bala\n\nThis is a beautifully written story, told from 3 different perspectives, about refugees from Sri Lanka and their saga trying to find refuge in Canada. Highly recommended.\n\nArbitrary number score: 91\n\nEye of the Needle\n\nBy Ken Follett\n\nI have liked everything by Ken Follett. This is not the best of his novels, but he knows how to write a good page turner.\n\nArbitrary number score: 78\n\nSomething Fresh\n\nBy P.G. Wodehouse\n\nI know of no author who has mastered comedic language quite like Wodehouse. His books are always a pleasure to read. (Wodehouse is one of the reasons I need this list. He wrote so much, and I have read almost everything. I am sure I missed a few, but I am not sure which ones, and I really don’t want to miss anything he wrote.)\n\nArbitrary number score: 80\n\nWarriors and Worriers\n\nBy Joyce F. Benenson\n\nAn exploration of sex and gender, and a discussion of whether there is a biologic foundation. The topic is very interesting, but it requires a degree of concentration that I don’t think I had when I was trying to read this.\n\nArbitrary number score: I don’t know\n\nThe Danger Within Us\n\nBy Jeanne Lenzer\n\nAn absolute must read, whether you are in medicine or not. Medical science has been broken in so many ways by the involvement of industry money. Using interesting stories about medical devices, this book chronicles many of those deficiencies.\n\nArbitrary number score: 88\n\nArm of the sphinx\n\nBy Josiah Bancroft\n\nNot nearly as good as the first book (Senlin Ascends) but OK for a light, fun read.\n\nArbitrary number score: 71\n\nOf Human Bondage\n\nBy Somerset Maugham\n\nI have considered this one of my favorite novels since reading it in my early teens. It is still a good novel, but I doesn’t quite stand up to my memory on re-reading.\n\nArbitrary number score: 79\n\nOn Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You’re Not\n\nBy: Robert A Burton\n\nI love learning and thinking about the fallibilities of the human brain. Others who like that topic will probably enjoy this book, but the writing isn’t great which made reading feel more like a chore than a pleasure at times.\n\nArbitrary number score: 69\n\nSpace Opera\n\nBy: Catherynne Valente\n\nI should have really liked this booked. It is Eurovision in space. Zany science fiction in the Hitchhiker’s guide genre, combined with fun playful language. I should of liked it, but honestly most of the time I found myself bored or lost in overly confusing sentences.\n\nArbitrary number score: 41\n\nEverything happens for a reason – And other lies I’ve loved\n\nBy: Kate Bowler\n\nI didn’t write a note after reading this, and now I really don’t remember it at all. Probably not a good sign.\n\nDaring Greatly: How the courage to be vulnerable transforms the way we live, love, parent, and lead\n\nBy: Brene Brown\n\nA discussion about how shame shapes our lives. The subject matter is interesting, but I didn’t find myself engaging with the book, nor did it leave me thinking when I put it down. Not great.\n\nArbitrary number score: 38\n\nReal artist don’t starve: Timeless strategies for thriving in the new creative age\n\nBy: Jeff Goins\n\nNot super applicable to a career in medicine, but perhaps incredibly applicable to FOAMed. I think this author would think it is incredibly silly to spend all one’s free time creating a medical education blog while at the same time dumping a lot of one’s own money into the project to keep a money losing project alive. Maybe I should have paid more attention when reading?\n\nArbitrary number score: 63\n\nThe book of M\n\nBy: Peng Sheperd\n\nThe premise of this book is interesting: people lose their shadows, which leads to them losing their memories. Forgetting how things are supposed to be results in some unexpected powers. Overall an OK but not great book.\n\nArbitrary number score: 74\n\nA darker shade of magic (Shade of Magic book 1)\n\nA gathering of shadows (Shades of Magic book 2)\n\nA conjuring of light (Shades of Magic book 3)\n\nBy: VE Schwab\n\nA fun series of books based around 4 versions of London with varying degrees of magic. Good enough for me to read all 3 books.\n\nArbitrary number score: 77 average\n\nThe Devil’s Alternative\n\nBy Fredrick Forsyth\n\nA cold war spy novel. It’s supposed to be a page turner, but I did not find myself really needing to turn the pages, so that probably says something.\n\nArbitrary number score: 45\n\nThe Girl With All the Gifts\n\nBy M.R. Carey\n\nI didn’t know this was a zombie book when I bought it, which is a good thing, because I probably wouldn’t have bought it if I knew. (I don’t really get the zombie obsession). I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nArbitrary number score: 82\n\nHappier at Home\n\nBy Gretchen Rubin\n\nNot sure what I was looking for with this book, but I didn’t find it.\n\nArbitrary number score: 25\n\nMr. Eternity\n\nBy Aaron Thier\n\nI liked the concept of this book. I like the issues it tackles. I really should love it, but in the end came away thinking it was just OK.\n\nArbitrary number score: 60\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe\n\nLife, the Universe, and Everything\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\n\nMostly Harmless\n\nBy Douglas Adams\n\nMust reads. This is probably my 5th or 6th time through, but it had been at least a decade since I last picked these novels up. That was probably too long, because once I started reading, I couldn’t stop.\n\nArbitrary number score: 100\n\nThe Ministry of Utmost Happiness\n\nBy Arundhati Roy\n\nWorth reading. A somewhat complex plot that weaves together the complex lives of a fairly large number of characters, but it offers some fascinating insights into the history, politics, religion, and culture of India, with a focus on those marginalized with that culture.\n\nArbitrary number score: 83\n\nLast Chance to See\n\nBy Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine\n\nFantastic book. This is nonfiction about endangered animals, but because of Douglas Adam’s way with language, I was laughing out loud throughout. I got some weird looks at the airport in Nairobi at one point. I can’t believe I didn’t know this book existed until this year. It is rare for me to reread a book, but I am sure I will read this again. It would get a perfect score, but because it is more than 25 years old, some of the details could probably use updating. I really wish that Douglas Adams was still alive to give us an updated version.\n\nArbitrary number score: 97\n\nThe Keeper of Lost Things\n\nBy Ruth Hogan\n\nThe novel was unique and interesting. The writing is great. The story is great. For some reason, it just felt like it was missing a little something for me, although I can’t put my finger on what.\n\nArbitrary number score: 79\n\nThe Alice Network\n\nBy Kate Quinn\n\nAn interesting historical fiction story told in 2 timelines. I have nothing bad to say, but I also can’t say anything particularly glowing.\n\nArbitrary number score: 73\n\nAjax Penumbra 1969\n\nBy Robin Sloan\n\nThis is really just a short story. It is the prequel to Mr. Penumbra’s 24 hour Bookstore, that I read a few years back and enjoyed. This probably doesn’t stand alone. I would read the 24 hour bookstore first.\n\nArbitrary number score: 76\n\nThe Punch Escrow\n\nBy Tal M Klein\n\nI liked this book. It was good, realistic sci-fi, with an attention to scientific detail that I appreciate, but it was also a decent page turner. It fell short of great, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun read.\n\nArbitrary number score: 79\n\nSnow Crash\n\nBy Neal Stephenson\n\nNot a fan. I should have been. Dystopian cyberpunk, with a good mix of action in and out of virtual reality should have been my kind of beach read, but I was mostly bored and couldn’t wait until it was time for the next book.\n\nArbitrary number score: 33\n\nPlatform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World\n\nBy Michael Hyatt\n\nI only really read this book because I was asked to give a talk on using social media in medicine and I didn’t feel like I had any expertise to offer. There isn’t much groundbreaking material in here, but there were enough decent insights that it would probably be worthwhile for a lot of people who use social media to connect with their audience.\n\nArbitrary number score: 25\n\nThe Social Media Bible\n\nBy Lon Safko\n\nAlso research for a talk. Not many people would enjoy this one.\n\nArbitrary number score: 10\n\nWriting on the Wall\n\nBy Tom Standage\n\nYet another social media book, but this is one that I think most people would enjoy reading. It gives a great historical perspective on social media. We like to think that social media is something unique to our times, but human beings are social creatures and have been creating communication networks for millenia. The technology has changed, but our drive for knowledge and interaction remains the same.\n\nArbitrary number score: 73\n\nThe Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror\n\nBy Christopher Moore\n\nVery funny. I am not sure why, but I was very biased against Christopher Moore. I think I thought he fit into the romance vampire genre, but it seems I was wrong. I am glad I gave this a shot, because I laughed out loud a number of times. I am sure more novels by Moore will show up here in time.\n\nArbitrary number score: 78\n\nLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ’s Childhood Pal\n\nBy Christopher Moore\n\nThis book was great. (It actually precedes The Stupidest Angel, but I read it after). It probably isn’t for everyone, but I think it is an intelligent and funny look at religion, in the format of a very readable novel, despite the fact you already know how it’s going to end.\n\nArbitrary number score: 86\n\nFinding Our Way Home: A family’s story of life, love, and loss\n\nBy Damon Dagnone\n\nThis is an incredibly powerful book. Anything I say will be biased, as I have always considered Damon to be among the very best teachers, emergency doctors, and people that I know. However, that bias was not what made me cry endlessly throughout this book. It is incredibly emotional, and will definitely force you to question some of your key thoughts about life.\n\nWilliam Osler: A life in medicine\n\nBy Michael Bliss\n\nI am not a huge fan of biographies, so it is not surprising that this book seemed a bit more like a chore than a pleasure at times. However, the insights into the history of medicine, and the perspective on how much things have changed in just over a hundred years made this a very worthwhile read.\n\nArbitrary number score: 61\n\nThe Skeptics Guide to the Universe: How to know what’s really real in a world increasingly full of fake.\n\nBy Steven Novella\n\nI think this book should be required reading early in school. It is a great primer on science and the many ways that we can be fooled by falsehood. This will definitely be added to the list of books I recommend to medical students and residents.\n\nArbitrary number score: 82\n\nKavalier and Clay\n\nBy Michael Chabon\n\nI picked this book up randomly, but have since discovered that it is a bit of a cult classic. I enjoyed it, but not with the fervor I have seen displayed elsewhere.\n\nArbitrary number score: 73\n\nPractical Demonkeeping\n\nBy Christopher Moore\n\nPart of a series with “The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove” and “The Stupidest Angel”, this was entertaining, but not as funny as Moore’s other books. For a quick light read, it was worth the time.\n\nArbitrary number score: 71\n\nThe Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove\n\nBy Christopher Moore\n\nA relatively funny light read, worthy of a few hours distraction after work.\n\nArbitrary number score: 79\n\nTheory and Reality: An introduction to the philosophy of science\n\nBy Peter Godfrey-Smith\n\nThis is really a textbook, so it isn’t surprising that it isn’t always an enjoyable read. I disagree with a number of the conclusions made, but if you are looking to get past some of the practical problems we see in science and want to understand the underpinnings of the enterprise, this book is worth the mental effort.\n\nArbitrary number score: 50\n\nDouglas Adam’s Starship Titanic: A Novel\n\nBy Terry Jones\n\nThis is a novel based on a computer game that Douglas Adams wrote. The genre, unsurprisingly, is science fiction comedy. It isn’t as good as anything written by Douglas Adams, but that is a difficult standard to measure by. It was funny and enjoyable, so I guess that is all that counts.\n\nArbitrary number score: 73\n\nThe Godwulf Manuscript (Spenser book 1)\n\nBy Robert Parker\n\nI was chatting with someone about the Jack Reacher series, and this series was suggested as a decent similar option. I like Jack Reacher more, but as a guilty pleasure page turner type of book, it definitely kept me turning pages, so that is good.\n\nArbitrary number score: 76\n\nStorm Front\n\nBy John Sandford\n\nAnother fairly standard page turner type novel. Nothing to rave about, but I will definitely pick up something by John Sandford again when faced with a long plane trip.\n\nArbitrary number score: 76\n\nThe Big Questions: How philosophy can change your life\n\nBy Lou Marinoff\n\nI love the idea of a philosophical counselor. I love the idea of using philosophical teaching to guide real life decisions. I would love to have someone to have these kind of discussions with me. But in the end, the book just seemed to drone on, often name dropping philosophers more than engaging with ideas, and devolving into just another self help book.\n\nArbitrary number score: 19\n\nThe Graveyard Book\n\nBy Neil Gaiman\n\nI think this is the first Neil Gaimon book I have read since American Gods back in highschool. American Gods was a great book (if I remember correctly). This was a good book, following a boy caught between the worlds of the living and the dead after his family is murdered.\n\nArbitrary number score: 77\n\nPachinko\n\nBy Min Jin Lee\n\nA lengthy book, but well worth it. A well crafted novel following multiple generations of a family from Korea to Japan through the bulk of the 20th century, giving an interesting perspective on the history between these countries, and the difficulties faced as outsiders in Japan.\n\nArbitrary number score: 83\n\nThe Strange Case of the Alchemist’s Daughter\n\nBy Theodora Goss\n\nMy wife loved this novel and can’t wait to read the sequel. I don’t think I like it at all. The story was an interesting combination of famous literary figures, such as Dr. Jekyll, Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein, and Dr. Moreau, but I found the writing dreadfully boring. The same story could have probably been told in half the number of pages and been much better.\n\nArbitrary number score: 55\n\nGod Save the Child (The Spenser Series Book 2)\n\nBy Robert Parker\n\nThe second book in the Spencer series, and it is much the same as the first. A good novel to unwind with after a shift, but nothing great.\n\nArbitrary number score: 76"
