        "text": "Writing that Douglas Adams cut from his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy novels is to be published for the first time after being found in his archive.\n\nHe wrote 16 chapters for an early version of Life, The Universe and Everything - but abandoned it, filed the typescript away and started again.\n\nIt has now been found, along with other unseen passages, in an archive of his work at the University of Cambridge.\n\nExtracts will be included in The Frood, a new biography by Jem Roberts.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in which Arthur Dent travels the universe after Earth is destroyed, first gained popularity as a BBC radio series in 1978.\n\nAn initial novel was published in 1979 and was followed by four more. Adams died in 2001 at the age of 49.\n\nAdams' family gave Jem Roberts permission to look at his papers after they were loaned to St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nThey included the abandoned draft for Life, The Universe and Everything, the third book in the series.\n\n\"The original version was going brilliantly - he had loads of really funny chapters and scenes - and then he just decided to abandon the whole lot and start from scratch,\" Roberts told BBC News.\n\n\"The book that we know has exactly the same plot. He'd written a version that was about two thirds of the way through before he abandoned it.\n\n\"A lot of people thought it had gone in the bin. But no. The manuscript with about 16 chapters is right there in St John's College.\""
