        "text": "A new edition of The Hitchhiker’s Guide, with out-of-this-world illustrations by children’s artist and author Chris Riddell, has just been published. It is the perfect edition for anyone who hasn’t read the book, or those who want to revisit its genius.\n\nThe sci-fi and fantasy YA books we’re looking forward to in 2021 so far\n\nNew readers could well find their lives transformed and their brains sent into a spin by the adventures of ordinary human Arthur Dent as he is whisked off into outer space to hitchhike around our galaxy.\n\nIt is a boring Thursday lunchtime, until workmen turn up at Arthur’s home to demolish it to make way for a new highway.\n\nAnd that’s just the start of the bad news: Planet Earth is next in line to be demolished to make way for an intergalactic freeway. But just before Earth is blasted into tiny cosmic fragments, Arthur’s best friend, Ford Prefect, announces that he is secretly an alien, grabs Arthur and hitches a ride on a passing spaceship.\n\nNext stop, somewhere deep in outer space.\n\nFranklin Rock: where time travel meets philosophy\n\nEquipped with their trusty towels (you’ll see why soon enough), a guide book and a multilingual fish, the two adventurers are off on a journey like no other. They meet a gang of bizarre space residents, including the gloriously named Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the wonderful Marvin the Paranoid Android, all brought visually to life by Riddell’s divine artwork.\n\nAs the plot, such as there is, spins into illogical mayhem, Adams plays around with physics, time and common sense. Even the most serious readers can’t help but laugh out loud.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide is inventive, packed with crazy energy, and dares to be silly just for the sake of it.\n\nNo publisher bothers to stamp an age range on Adams’ comedy classic. It is a phenomenon that has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, and counting, to tween, teens and adults.\n\nThe books every teen boy should read before he graduates\n\nBefore his sudden death in 2001, Adams expanded The Hitchhiker’s Guide into a TV series, a stage adaptation, many comic books, and a must-have bath towel, but it’s the novel that threatens to outlive every other manifestation of Dent’s manic adventure in space.\n\nThis latest edition of one of the world’s most entertaining travel guides acknowledges the importance of the number 42 (hence the 42nd anniversary edition), and the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\n\nDon’t try to work that one out before reading The Hitchhiker’s Guide. After travelling with Dent to the outer reaches of the galaxy, everything will become obvious. Maybe ...\n\nEnjoy the trip! And don’t forget your towel."
