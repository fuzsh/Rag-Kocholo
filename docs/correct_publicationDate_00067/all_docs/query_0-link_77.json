        "text": "The first novel in this hilarious sci-fi series originally aired as a BBC radio show in 1978, before being published as a book series a year later.\n\nThe trilogy sold 15 million copies, and was later adapted into several films, a television series, a stage play, and even a video game.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy saga follows the adventures of a space-traveling hitchhiker named Arthur Dent. Arthur must navigate the galaxy after Earth has been destroyed by the Vogon: a race of aliens from the planet of Vogsphere. A clueless and clumsy hero, Arthur survives a series of space adventures with the help of his friend Ford Prefect.\n\nRead this series to enjoy the protagonist’s hilarious ineptitude, thrilling adventures, and amusing galactic dilemmas.\n\nRELATED: 10 Hilarious and Insightful Douglas Adams Quotes\n\nPublished in 1987, Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency is the first book of another highly-successful Douglas Adams series.\n\nIt follows the journey of private investigator Dirk Gently. With the help of an old college friend, Richard MacDuff, the detective takes on the challenge of preventing a million-year-old ghost from fulfilling its dream to erase the existence of humanity.\n\nSimilar to Arthur's escapades in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Detective Dirk Gently must embark on a sci-fi adventure full of treacherous aliens, ghosts, and time travel in order to reverse a horrible mistake and save the world.\n\nDevastating family, friends, and fans, Douglas Adams passed away from a heart attack at the age of 49 in 2001. The Salmon of Doubt, intended to be the third novel in the Dirk Gently series, was unfinished at the time of his death.\n\nIn 2002, Adams' completed chapters of The Salmon of Doubt were published in this volume along with a collection of other previously-unpublished and published materials by Adams.\n\nFans who had waited more than a decade for the next book in the Dirk Gently series were grateful to read the author's final work. The plot of The Salmon of Doubt takes place several weeks after the events in The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul, the second book in the series.\n\nPartnering with zoologist Mark Carwardine, Adams wrote the nonfiction book Last Chance to See, detailing their mission to travel the world in search of the most gravely-endangered animals.\n\nAdams expanded beyond his usual work in fiction and comedy to bring awareness to environmental crises. His wit is still evident in the stories of his adventures with Carwardine, but Adams also offers more serious commentary about the role humanity plays in animal extinction.\n\nThe novel was adapted into a BBC docuseries by the same name in 2009, after Adams' untimely death. English actor Stephen Fry replaced his friend Adams on the journeys with Carwardine.\n\nRELATED: Neil Gaiman Talks the Timeless Appeal of Douglas Adams\n\nHave you ever had a familiar feeling, but can’t find the words to describe it?\n\nCo-authored by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd, The Deeper Meaning of Liff is a dictionary of whimsical words that can be used to describe these common situations, feelings, or objects that have no name.\n\nOriginally published in 1983 as The Meaning of Liff, the book perfectly addressed this odd but common phenomena, and was very popular with readers at the time. Its special edition, The Deeper Meaning of Liff, is a more modern, but equally-comical dictionary."
