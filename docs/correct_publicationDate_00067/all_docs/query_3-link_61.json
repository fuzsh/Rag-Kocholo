        "text": "The Fantasy Review’s list of 7 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books Similar to Good Omens.\n\nMort (Death, #1) by Terry Pratchett\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nDeath comes to everyone eventually on Discworld. And now he’s come to Mort with an offer the young man can’t refuse. (No, literally, can’t refuse since being dead isn’t exactly compulsory.) Actually, it’s a pretty good deal. As Death’s apprentice, Mort will have free board and lodging. He’ll get use of the company horse. And he won’t have to take any time off for family funerals. But despite the obvious perks, young Mort is about to discover that there is a serious downside to working for the Reaper Man . . . because this perfect job can be a killer on one’s love life.…\n\nAmerican Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nReleased from prison, Shadow finds his world turned upside down. His wife has been killed; a stranger offers him a job and Shadow, with nothing to lose, accepts. But a storm is coming. Beneath the placid surface of everyday life, a war is being fought – and the prize is the very soul of America.,,,\n\nLegends & Lattes (Legends & Lattes, #1) by Travis Baldree\n\nCheck out our review of Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree, plus the prequel novel, Bookshops & Bonedust.\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nAfter a lifetime of bounties and bloodshed, Viv is hanging up her sword for the last time.\n\nThe battle-weary orc aims to start fresh, opening the first ever coffee shop in the city of Thune. But old and new rivals stand in the way of success ― not to mention the fact that no one has the faintest idea what coffee actually is.\n\nIf Viv wants to put the blade behind her and make her plans a reality, she won’t be able to go it alone…..\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, #1) by Douglas Adams\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nIt’s an ordinary Thursday morning for Arthur Dent . . . until his house gets demolished. The Earth follows shortly after to make way for a new hyperspace express route, and Arthur’s best friend has just announced that he’s an alien.\n\nAfter that, things get much, much worse.\n\nWith just a towel, a small yellow fish, and a book, Arthur has to navigate through a very hostile universe in the company of a gang of unreliable aliens. Luckily the fish is quite good at languages. And the book is The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . . . which helpfully has the words DON’T PANIC inscribed in large, friendly letters on its cover.…\n\nThe Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England by Brandon Sanderson\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nA man awakes in a clearing in what appears to be medieval England with no memory of who he is, where he came from, or why he is there. Chased by a group from his own time, his sole hope for survival lies in regaining his missing memories, making allies among the locals, and perhaps even trusting in their superstitious boasts. His only help from the “real world” should have been a guidebook entitled The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England, except his copy exploded during transit. The few fragments he managed to save provide clues to his situation, but can he figure them out in time to survive?\n\nAll Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries, #1) by Martha Wells\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\n“As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure.”\n\nIn a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety.\n\nBut in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn’t a primary concern….\n\nThe Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1) by Rick Riordan\n\nFrom the blurb:\n\nHalf boy. Half God. ALL Hero.\n\nLook, I didn’t want to be a half-blood. I never asked to be the son of a Greek God.\n\nI was just a normal kid, going to school, playing basketball, skateboarding. The usual. Until I accidentally vaporized my maths teacher. Now I spend my time battling monsters and generally trying to stay alive.\n\nThis is the one where Zeus, God of the Sky, thinks I’ve stolen his lightning bolt – and making Zeus angry is a very bad idea…\n\nRelated to: 7 Science Fiction and Fantasy Books Similar to Good Omens"
