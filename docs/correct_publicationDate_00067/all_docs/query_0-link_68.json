        "text": "This Omnibus Edition Includes the First 4 books in the \"Hitchhikers guide Trilogy\" 5 book set.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is also the title of the first of five books in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy comedy science fiction series by Douglas Adams. The novel is an adaptation of the first four parts of Adams's radio series of the same name. The novel was first published in London in October 1979.\n\nThe novel takes its name the fictional The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a guide book for hitchhikers (inspired by the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe) written in the form of an encyclopedia.\n\nThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe is the second book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It was originally published by Pan Books as a paperback. It takes its name from Milliway's, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, one of the settings of the book.\n\nLife, the Universe and Everything is the third book in the five-volume Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The title refers to the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.\n\nSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish is the fourth book of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Its title is the message left by the >dolphins when they departed Planet Earth just before it was demolished to make way for a hyperspatial express route, as described in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The phrase has since been adopted by some science fiction fans as a humorous way to say \"goodbye\" and a song of the same name was featured in the 2005 film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nReview by Teccie"
