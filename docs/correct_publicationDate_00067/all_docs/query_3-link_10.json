        "text": "Post by Shadow Phoenix on\n\nJust curious on this. I'm an avid reader off-line and am currently working my way through a post-apocalyptic private investigator type trilogy set in the near future. I'm also a fan of the Dragonriders Of Pern books (read several mutliple times). I've read, if I remember right, the first four of the Harry Potter books. Read and re-read more times than I can count all of the Narnia series. Read and enjoyed the Hobbit (tried the Lord Of The Rings books, but didn't really get into the first one, let alone through it, lol). I read Ender's Game and a few other books by Card (forgive me if I didn't spell that right), yet it takes some efforts as, to me at least, its kind of a dry read (don't get me wrong, I still think he's a great writer).\n\nLol, if I was to go through all the books I've read in my life, we would be hear forever.\n\nPost by pax on\n\nMercedes Lackey has multiple trilogies, standalone novels, and even short story collections set in her world, Velgarth - IMO you should start with Arrows of the Queen, the first book she ever published.\n\nIf you think you might like some hard, Military SF, I can gladly recommend anything by David Weber. You can start the \"Honorverse\" setting with the first book, On Basilisk Station.\n\nWeber also collaborated with Steve White to write In Death Ground, a good opener for a different sort of setting (FTL tech is very, very different there than in the Honorverse books).\n\nJohn Ringo's Posleen War novels also make an interesting read ...\n\nPost by Admin on\n\nSince I do alot of driving in my work I mainly listen to audiobooks. I'm currently working my way through the original Conan stories and they are truly fantastic; ahead of their time. If anyone is interested in reading them I recommend the 3 Del Ray collections:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(books)#Wandering_Star.2FDel_Rey_editions.2C_2003-2005\n\nHowever, as there are a ton of stories in the Conan saga, I have also been listening to some other things in between. Most recently I listened to \"Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep\", which was a great short story and inspiration for the movie Blade Runner.\n\nI'm also a huge HP Lovecraft fan, and would highly recommend the stories \"The Call of Cthulhu\", \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" and \"At the Mountains of Madness\".\n\nPost by Shadow Phoenix on\n\n*Perks up.*\n\nDid someone mention the Eragon books? I'm waiting for the 4th book to come out.\n\nRight now, I'm re-reading 'Mindstar Rising' by Greg Mendel. Its the first book in the 'private eye' trilogy I mentioned earlier.\n\nLol, so many books I've read. Not all I liked, but, it will take me some time to remember them all.\n\nHere's a list of what I currently recall:\n\nMindstar Rising\n\nThe Nano Flower\n\nEragon\n\nEldest\n\nBrisingr\n\nDragongirl\n\nFreedom's Challenge\n\nFreedom's Ransom\n\nDragon's Kin\n\nThe Dig\n\nChronicles Of The Lensmen\n\nThat's just looking at random books and remembering which ones I've read from those on the bookshelf next to me, lol.\n\nPost by Zydrate on\n\nYes, I'm a fan of dragon-themed books. Preferably the ones where they have minds and are mentors or protagonists.\n\nGranted, I know some of them are just above \"beasts\" and can be accurately betrayed as enemy monsters but... I kind of like my dragons to have brains.\n\nPost by Shadow Phoenix on\n\nYes, I'm a fan of dragon-themed books. Preferably the ones where they have minds and are mentors or protagonists.\n\nGranted, I know some of them are just above \"beasts\" and can be accurately betrayed as enemy monsters but... I kind of like my dragons to have brains.\n\nLol, same here. Always more enjoyable to have a character with his/her own flaws and other personality traits...though I do recall, off hand, reading about some decent examples of 'background non-sentient' dragons.\n\nOf course, that also involves the issues when its a 'thinking dragon' that doesn't speak a human language...though, in those cases, usually at least one character can understand what the dragon is saying.\n\nPost by stratosphere on\n\nI love the Pern books also. If you haven't checked out Anne McCaffrey's Talent series, and Talent and Hive series, you really should, you won't be able to put them down. The Rowan is easily one of my all time favorite books. \"Talents\" are people with mental powers like Telepathy, Telekinesis, Precognition etc...\n\nAnother fantastic series is the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, absolutely not light reading but fantastic stories and concepts.\n\nPost by melkathi on\n\nBooks huh?\n\nHmm let's see if the linky works:\n\nwww.goodreads.com/review/list/1641872-stavros-tsiakalos?shelf=read\n\nMy Goodreads list. Feel free to say hello over there\n\nReading Metro 2033 at the moment as I was told the book is great (haven't tried the game that was then based on the book and apparently is great too). I am enjoying the post apocalyptic, claustrophobic, thriller, horror setting so far, though the english translation seems to be wanting at times and the editing is a bit lacking as well :/\n\nBut the greek translation was twice the price... should have waited till my next visit to germany and get a german translation. We learn from our mistakes.\n\nPost by not1stepbackwards on\n\nThe Discworld series by Terry Pratchett - a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy series, it's like the Lonely Island playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nBut for something different yet also extremely enjoyable...\n\nFreakonomics and its sequel, Super Freakonomics - it's real life situations analysed by a hardcore economist but written in layman's terms...and reads like science fiction. Freaking mind-blowing stuff.\n\nPost by melkathi on\n\nThe Discworld series by Terry Pratchett - a thoroughly enjoyable fantasy series, it's like the Lonely Island playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nStood in line when The Truth came out to get a signed copy\n\nGot my copy of Mort signed while I was at it.\n\nPost by ashken on\n\nJust finished Ex-Heroes which was a really nice read: www.amazon.com/Ex-Heroes-Peter-Clines/dp/1934861286\n\nAlso Invasion: Book One of the Secret World is a rather nice book: www.amazon.com/Invasion-Book-Secret-World-Chronicle/dp/1439134197/ref=sr_1_16?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1315305600&sr=1-16\n\nBoth books are superhero themed, so they should fit right in with this crowd"
