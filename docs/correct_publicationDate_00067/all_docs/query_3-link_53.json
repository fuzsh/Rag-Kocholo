He was once an angel – a winged warrior sworn to protect Paya, a realm where people live on discs that float in space.\n\nHe failed.\n\nNow, Leon’s a broken man, trying to forget the past. He thinks he’s the last angel. But then a young fugitive stumbles onto Leon’s doorstep. She’s an angel, too. And she has a riddle leading to a place where angels still live. Or so the stories claim…\n\nDesperate for redemption, Leon begins a perilous quest through myth and folklore. But will Leon and the fugitive find their legendary destination? Or will Leon lose his last chance for salvation?\n\nBrutal and gripping, this is a story about a flawed man’s search for forgiveness.\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness is a visionary sci-fi story about a lone human ambassador to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants’ biology allows them to choose—and change—their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely different culture that he encounters. Exploring psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness is as a landmark achievement - especially considering that it came out in 1969!\n\nIn this episode, I examined how despite being very slow-paced (or, perhaps, because of this), Le Guin's novel is incredibly engaging.

It's a win-win!)\n\nScience fiction space operas are stories told at an epic scale. How can you make such a vast world accessible to readers? How can you ground these fantastical and strange new worlds in a sense of realism?\n\nBalancing the epic with the human is perhaps the greatest strength of Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey (first book in The Expanse). Today's show dives deep into analysing how characters are they key to guiding readers through epic stories.\n\nShow Notes:\n\njedherne.com/fires – get a free short story and join my email newsletter to hear about future book giveaways!\n\njedherne.com/question – submit your questions for the show!\n\nanchor.fm – what I use to make my podcast for free (note: I am not sponsored by them and I make no money for this – just recommending a useful tool that I use)\n\nWords of Radiance is the second book in The Stormlight Archive, an epic fantasy series of incredible ambition - and superb execution. What's remarkable about WOR isn't just the world building, the twisting plot, or the amazing characters (although they're all great). No, what made this book remarkable was the emotional response it created within me. In this episode, I explain how you can do the same for your stories.

It's one that Rowling mastered in the Harry Potter series, where all the information is available to readers well before it's needed, but only coalesces at the required moment. In today's episode, I describe the 4 M's of subtle foreshadowing, in relation to the Potter saga. Enjoy!\n\nRead my debut fantasy novella, Fires of the Dead.\n\n\"The perfect read for someone looking to be quickly immersed in a magic system unlike anything else.\" - Nicole Wallace, editor of Synopses by Sarge.\n\nAvailable in ebook, paperback, hardback, and audio book.\n\nEmail me - I love hearing from listeners and I respond to every message: jed.herne1(at)gmail.com\n\nStoked to interview Gareth Hanrahan, author of The Gutter Prayer - which I analysed on the show just a few days ago.

Here's my key world-building lessons learnt from this book:\n\n1. Consider the first scene as a microcosm\n\n2. The first scene sets the tone\n\n3. Explore your interests\n\n4. Consider how different characters react to the same world.\n\n5. More ideas is better than not enough\n\n6. Layer it up!\n\n7. Treat the city as a character\n\n8.

Miller Jr. It's often described as one of the first post-apocalyptic stories. Without it, there would be no Book of Eli, The Stand, or most other post-apocalyptic tales. Don't just take my word for it. It won the 1961 Hugo Award - one of science fiction's highest honours. Legendary scientist Carl Sagan described it as: \"so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that [it] sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\".\n\nIt's a remarkable novel. I don't have the space in one episode to fully analyse it, so today I'm focusing on just one thing: how it uses an unconventional structure to explore the theme and emotionally gut-punch readers.

It's got a racing plot, an interesting setting, and amazing characters. In this episode, I analyse the relationship between Kaz and Inej, using Mary Robinette Kowal's 6 relationship axes:\n\nMind - Both people have similar levels of intelligence.\n\nMoney - Both people have similar attitudes about money. They don't both have to have the same amount. This is about what money is for and how it's handled.\n\nMorals - Similar moral compasses of right and wrong.\n\nManners - Similar senses of what is polite. So it's possible to have the same manners and wildly different morals.\n\nMonogamy - Similar attitudes about the relationship. You know that guy that thinks you are BFFs and you think you're just colleagues?\n\nMarx Brothers - You both find the same things funny.\n\nSource: https://www.patreon.com/posts/writing-stable-8172456\n\nShow Notes:\n\nGo here to see the table I mentioned: https://novelanalyst.com/?p=536\n\nEpisode 25 - all about Crooked Kingdom, the sequel to this novel: https://novelanalyst.com/2019/04/30/25-crooked-kingdom-by-leigh-bardugo-the-art-of-setting-descriptions/\n\nCheck out my youtube channel for writing advice every weekday: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVjB-qFoNxNbQq0S3boWxIA?view_as=subscriber\n\nJoin my exclusive free Reader Club email newsletter to stay up to date with my writing projects: https://jedherne.com/club/\n\nTwitter: @jedherne\n\nEmail: jed.herne1@gmail.com\n\nAfter Dale from The Reading Gorilla podcast sent in a listener request, who was I to ignore it?
