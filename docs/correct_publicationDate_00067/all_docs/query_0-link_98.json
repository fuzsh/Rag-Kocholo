        "text": "Douglas NoÃ«l Adams (March 11, 1952 â€“ May 11, 2001) was a cult British comic radio dramatist, amateur musician and author, most notably of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a \"trilogy\" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a television series, a towel, a comic book series, a computer game and a feature film that was completed after Adams's death. In addition to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who, and served the series as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the Dirk Gently novels, and co-author credits on two Liff books and Last Chance to See, itself based on a radio series. His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist, a self-described \"radical atheist\" and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other \"techno gizmos.\" He was a keen technologist, using such inventions as e-mail and Usenet before they became widely popular, or even widely known. Since his death at the age of 49, he is still widely revered in science fiction and fantasy fandom circles."
