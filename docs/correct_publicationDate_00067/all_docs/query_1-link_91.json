On 12 October 1979 the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor (and Earth) was made available to humanity - The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. It&#39;s an ordinary Thursday lunchtime for Arthur Dent until his house gets demolished. The Earth follows shortly afterwards to make way for a new hyperspace bypass and his best friend has just announced that he&#39;s an alien. At this moment, they&#39;re hurtling through space with nothing but their towels and an innocuous-looking book inscribed with the big, friendly words: DON&#39;T PANIC. The weekend has only just begun... Volume one in the trilogy of five",
