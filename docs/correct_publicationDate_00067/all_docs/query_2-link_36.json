        "text": "For a soft-spoken man of gentle manners and slight build, writer Eoin Colfer has no shortage of creative courage. While others might have shied away from following in the legendary footsteps of the late Douglas Adams, the Irish author accepted the challenge of penning a new installment of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nStill, despite the generally positive response to his And Another Thing ..., which was released last month, Colfer says he's not interested in doing another Hitchhiker's Guide book.\n\n\"I don't want to continue the series,\" Colfer told Wired.com in a telephone interview. \"I enjoyed writing this book, but I don't want to write another one. I treated it as a one-time opportunity.\"\n\nColfer's And Another Thing ... proves a worthy successor to Adams' original five-book \"trilogy,\" which started as a BBC Radio comedy and spawned a worldwide sci-fi/comedy phenomenon. Aside from books, the enduring story of an Englishman and an alien travelogue writer traversing the universe has spawned a television series, a feature film, a videogame, comic books, several stage shows and even towels.\n\nIn And Another Thing ..., Colfer recaptures the surreal spirit of Adams' work without trying too hard to inject a pale impression of the late writer's comic voice.\n\nThere's no need for Colfer to overreach. His internationally popular Artemis Fowl books put him on a tier similar to J.K. Rowling's and made him a natural choice to pick up where Adams left off when he died unexpectedly in 2001 at age 49.\n\nBut Colfer didn't jump immediately at the opportunity when it came up after Adams' widow, Jane Belson, wanted to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the original Hitchhiker's Guide with a new book in the series. \"I was reluctant when my agent first contacted me,\" Colfer said. \"What writer wouldn't be — considering Douglas' genius?\"\n\nColfer insists that the most important factor in completing And Another Thing ... was steering clear of the pressures involved in inheriting Arthur Dent, extraterrestrial guidebook author Ford Prefect, Marvin the Paranoid Android, Zaphod and the rest of Adams' extended universe of characters.\n\n\"I realized early on that I had to focus on the story and not worry about anything else,\" Colfer said. \"The danger was finding myself unable to get out of my own head because I was too aware of the legacy I was taking on writing the book.\"\n\nThough Colfer doesn't want to tackle a seventh entry in the series, he said he hopes somebody does.\n\n\"I do think someone should write another,\" he said. \"I think it'd be interesting to see other Hitchhiker's books from different authors — to see how different imaginations and different voices present that universe.\"\n\nWhile Colfer was making the rounds promoting his Hitchhiker's adventure set in space, he was dealing with an ongoing rumor that he'll be working on another fan-favorite sci-fi story: Colfer's name is routinely connected with Steven Moffat's upcoming production of BBC's classic Doctor Who television series.\n\nWhile other sci-fi heavy hitters like Paul Cornell and Neil Gaiman are also rumored to be on Moffat's writers list, Colfer reports that he's not writing an episode for the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith.\n\nNot yet, anyway.\n\n\"I'd love to write a Doctor Who,\" he said. \"But there are no plans in place for me to do so. It's a rumor I started hearing, and I don't know where it began. But, should the opportunity arise, I think any writer would be a fool not to give it a try.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nAnd Another Thing ...
