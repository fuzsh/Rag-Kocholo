        "text": "Beware of the Leopard!\n\nThis version is similar-but-different to previous releases - which of course means it's worth purchasing!! Guessing this was originally released Long Long Ago and has been re-issued in 2020 as a Limited Physical Media (Album) release along with a Digital Version. Getting the Digital Version (via Audible) is a matter of a Click and a Credit, so of course went with Digital.\n\nThis release is closer to an audio version of the 1980 TV series rather than the original radio scripts, and comes in six chapters like the TV series consisted of six episodes. Starts at (Part 1 Side 1 #1) with Arthur trying unsuccessfully to save his home from a Big Yellow Bulldozer and ends at (Part 2 Side 2 #5) pulling letters out a scrabble Bag on Pre-Historic Earth to discover what 6x9 really is...\n\nTotal time is about 2hr 38 mins. The PDF (listing below is from the PDF) is eight pages and contains what I assume to be artwork from the LP release.\n\nPart One\n\n----------\n\nSide 1 (Digital Chapter 1)\n\n===========================\n\nIn which the Earth is unexpectedly destroyed and the great hitch-hike begins. . .\n\n1.

After 40 years, it's here!\n\nAt last, after 40 years, you can now hear the original LP version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and it sounds great!\n\nBack in 1979, the first album, released as a double LP featured material from the first 4 episodes of the Radio series, with a few cast changes, such as Cindy Oswen as Trillian, and Valentine Dyall as Deep Thought. Douglas Adams, himself, can be heard. See if you can figure out where he shows up. This material very closely matches material from episodes 1-4 of the original radio series.\n\nIn 1980, another LP was released, featuring material similar to episodes 5 and 6 of the radio series, but, being a little more like the tv series. For example, the ship Zaphod steals turns out to belong to the rock band Disaster Area, and it's not going to be a fun ride. That's all I'll say, not wanting to give away too many spoilers.\n\nThis is a must for Hitchhiker fans who want a more complete audio collection.\n\nBack then, you would have had to buy the first album in 1979, then wait until some time in 1980 to buy the second LP to complete the set. but now, you get it all in one convenient package. It's all here and you don't have to wait! Add this to your cart right now! You'll be listening in seconds.\n\nA Must-Listen for Douglas Adams Fans\n\nI had initially given this a very poor review due to some audio issues. I leave that review below for context. I have since discovered that my problem was with the device I was using to listen, not with the audible file. I want to apologize to anyone I misled, or anyone who may have been working so hard on this project and had to put up with my unfounded criticism. The original review follows:\n\nAs the self-proclaimed biggest Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fan in the world, I was really looking forward to the release of these albums, which I owned on vinyl back in the eighties. I had my preorder before it was even announced to be in my library, and I eagerly listened to it.\n\nFirst, the albums themselves. This is essential listening for any true fan of the series. There are aspects of it that are both better and worse than the radio series. Some of the technical gaffes due to editing, particularly in the first two episodes, are accounted for in this reimagining. Peter Jones sounds more himself, and less subdued, at the beginning. Some good use is made of improved technology. Unfortunately, particularly in the first two records, the dialog is rushed somewhat for time. Some scenes are cut, others are abridged. But over all, the albums served a purpose in a time which, for reasons that were very entertainingly written out on the album cover, the actual radio series could not be sold.\n\nThe area that is especially disappointing, however, involves the audio quality of the remastering. Obviously, a form of noise-reduction is being applied here by Audible. As with Earthsearch, another BBC offering, this noise reduction has the undesirable effect of removing some of the background sound, such as the Heart of Gold on sides 2, assuming those sounds to be noise, and not intentional sound. The result is a very choppy-sounding set of background sounds. I really hope these albums are eventually released on CD without this excessive noise-reduction being applied.\n\nRecording transfer quality is below sub-par\n\nI've been a HHGG fan since the radio show first aired on the BBC in 1979. I was so pleased to find that the re-recorded vinyl records (with some notable changes from the radio show) were being made available here on Audible.\n\nProblem is, it's an absolutely terrible transfer. Some of the tones have very obvious distortion in the higher frequencies and it's just tinny all-around. The vinyl, which I own from the original release, is so rich in tone and accomplishes Douglas Adams' hope of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sounding \"like a rock album,\" as he said in a few different interviews.\n\nAs always, the production itself is absolutely, deliriously fun to listen to, but the abysmal quality of the transfer makes it far less of a treat. This album deserves better."
