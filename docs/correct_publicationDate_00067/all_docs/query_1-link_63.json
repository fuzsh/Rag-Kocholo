The novels are described as \"a trilogy in five parts\", having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book, and then a \"trilogy in four parts\" on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend \"The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy\" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore the legend \"The [first, second, third, fourth] book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy\". In addition, the blurb on the fifth book describes it as \"the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word 'trilogy'\". The first book was adapted from the first four radio episodes (the Primary Phase), with Arthur being rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford, meeting Zaphod and Trillian, coming to the planet of Magrathea to discover the true purpose of Earth, and ending with the group preparing to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelization, an action they would later regret.
