        "text": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nBy Douglas Adams,\n\nFrom my list on when you really need to get away, without actually getting away.\n\nBy Ben Forta Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI read and write lots and love doing so. So when I need a break, the last thing I want is another book, right? Wrong! I take a break with books, and I love fun books that are an escape from the normal day-to-day, ones that won’t lull you to sleep, ones that end too quickly. It’s a sickness, I know, and I’ll deal with it as soon as I have worked through this pile of books on my desk.\n\nBen's book list on when you really need to get away, without actually getting away\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nOh, what’s not to love? Space travel, poetry writing aliens, a criminal galactic president, the end of the world, a depressed robot … this book has it all, and I reread it (and the other 4 volumes in the trilogy, yes, trilogy) every year or so.\n\nThis is a fun escape, I discovered this volume as a kid, fell in love with it, and it’s my favorite book still to this day all these centuries later.\n\nBy Douglas Adams,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n34 authors picked The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis box set contains all five parts of the' trilogy of five' so you can listen to the complete tales of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Bebblebrox and Marvin the Paranoid Android! Travel through space, time and parallel universes with the only guide you'll ever need, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nRead by Stephen Fry, actor, director, author and popular audiobook reader, and Martin Freeman, who played Arthur Dent in film version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. He is well known as Tim in The Office.\n\nThe set also includes a bonus DVD Life, the Universe and…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Time of the Dark\n\nBy Barbara Hambly,\n\nFrom my list on transport select people from Earth to other realms.\n\nBy Steven J. Morris Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFantasy takes me to a place where I can get out of my own skin, explore new worlds, and live adventures. The stories that pulled folks from our world (for those of you as loosely tethered as I am, I refer to Earth) provided more connection to the idea that I could be in those fantasy worlds and involved in those stories. That’s the bonus level of escapism! I didn’t realize just how many of my favorite stories fell into that category until I wrote this. Those books were definitely instrumental in my writing, though I didn’t follow any of those specific formulas. I’ll have to write another grouping for the other major category of books that influenced my writing.\n\nSteven's book list on transport select people from Earth to other realms\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nThis is the first book of the three-book Darwath Series. A powerful wizard, in an attempt to save his world, winds up pulling a couple of people over from Earth. The relationships and the struggles, along with the wry humor, make this book great. All of Hambly’s fantasy books that I’ve read have worlds where magic does not come easy, and I always appreciate the price that magic users have to pay. This series of hers has a frighteningly good tale—that ending!\n\nBy Barbara Hambly,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Time of the Dark as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nGil, a graduate student, discovers that her nightmares of people fleeing in panic from a hideous evil are not dreams and that she is standing in the doorway to another world\n\nPreview\n\nThe Mirror of Her Dreams\n\nBy Stephen R. Donaldson,\n\nFrom my list on hopeful unlikely heroes who change their fate.\n\nBy Brandi Schonberg Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nEscapism is my drug of choice. As a child, I was angry that my existence was confined to this reality, and I did everything I could to find a way out. Stories made it bearable. Whether it was Thor’s Bifrost, the wardrobe of Narnia, or the mirror in Stephen R. Donaldson’s Mordant’s Need duology, I was hooked. Now, I tell my own stories of escape. I create and invite others to find solace, adventure, love, and passion in fantasy realms, outer space, and reinvented parallel realities. This door is always open.\n\nBrandi's book list on hopeful unlikely heroes who change their fate\n\nWhy did Brandi love this book?\n\nRemember A-ha’s video for Take on Me? In it, a man in a comic book pulls a woman into that two-dimensional world, and in a moment of desperation, he sends her back to save her. But true love prevails, and she pulls him into a three-dimensional life. I loved this video far more than the song, and I think I know why.\n\nI have long been fascinated by interdimensional travel, and Donaldson’s book might be the root of the reason. A young woman, dissatisfied and disillusioned with everyday life, is offered an opportunity to escape and she takes it by following a man who crashed through her mirror. She becomes the unlikeliest of heroes as she navigates enemies and intrigue in a world she knows nothing about. The escapist in me relished the thought of finding another world and slipping away. Not knowing if the return was possibly teased out…\n\nBy Stephen R. Donaldson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Mirror of Her Dreams as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWith The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Stephen R. Donaldson changed the face of fantasy fiction forever. In The Mirror of Her Dreams, the astonishing first novel in the two-volume Mordant’s Need series, Donaldson shows us a world of wondrous beauty and seductive illusion, where mirrors hold the deadliest of magics and nothing is what it seems. . . .\n\nThe daughter of rich but neglectful parents, Terisa Morgan lives alone in a New York City apartment, a young woman who has grown to doubt her own existence. Surrounded by the flat reassurance of mirrors, she leads an unfulfilled life—until the…\n\nPreview\n\nThe War of the Flowers\n\nBy Tad Williams,\n\nFrom my list on transport select people from Earth to other realms.\n\nBy Steven J. Morris Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFantasy takes me to a place where I can get out of my own skin, explore new worlds, and live adventures. The stories that pulled folks from our world (for those of you as loosely tethered as I am, I refer to Earth) provided more connection to the idea that I could be in those fantasy worlds and involved in those stories. That’s the bonus level of escapism! I didn’t realize just how many of my favorite stories fell into that category until I wrote this. Those books were definitely instrumental in my writing, though I didn’t follow any of those specific formulas. I’ll have to write another grouping for the other major category of books that influenced my writing.\n\nSteven's book list on transport select people from Earth to other realms\n\nWhy did Steven love this book?\n\nTad Williams has many acclaimed series, but this stand-alone novel is my favorite. The protagonist is pulled into another realm where magic reigns supreme. The protagonist must uncover his past while learning about his place in the magical realm before both worlds are destroyed. The way Williams has connected up the two worlds is unique, and the world-building alone gets this story on my must-read list.\n\nBy Tad Williams,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The War of the Flowers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTheo Vilmos' life is about to take a real turn for the worse.\n\nHe is drawn from his home in Northern California into the parallel world of Faerie, for, unknown to him, he is a pivotal figure in a war between certain of Faerie's powerful lords and the rest of the strange creatures who live in this exotic realm.\n\nPreview\n\nCyteen\n\nBy C. J. Cherryh,\n\nFrom my list on exploring what it means to be human.\n\nBy Acflory Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m one of those odd people who always needs to know why. Why do computers work, why do societies break down? Why do humans kill? Why are cat videos so irresistible? All of those questions explore what it means to be human, but science fiction takes those questions to the extreme, pitting people against the most extreme environments and situations in order to see how they’ll react. To me, that never grows old, and the books I love the most are the ones that do it the best. In my humble opinion, of course.\n\nAcflory's book list on exploring what it means to be human\n\nWhy did Acflory love this book?\n\nCyteen won a Hugo Award in 1989 and pushed the envelope on both world building and character development. For me though, it was the author’s exploration of what it means to be human that made this book one of my all-time favourites.\n\nIn Cyteen, there are born humans and made people. Some of the made people are clones of a particularly powerful individual, but most are created to perform a function. These lower-ranked people are taught everything they need to know by ‘tape’, while they sleep.\n\nThe book asks some deep philosophical questions about what makes a person human, and whether any of us have the right to create ‘sub-humans’ for our own benefit. These are powerful questions that still beg for answers.\n\nBy C. J. Cherryh,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Cyteen as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe saga of two young friends trapped in an endless nightmare of suspicion and surveillance, of cyber-programmed servants and a ruling class with century-long lives - and the enigmatic woman who dominates them all. Narrators Jonathan Davis and Gabra Zackman skillfully split up this sweeping sci-fi epic that is \"at once a psychological novel, a murder mystery, and an examination of power on a grand scale.\" (Locus)\n\nPreview\n\nIdyll\n\nBy James Derry,\n\nWhy did Sunshine love this book?\n\nThis is one of the very few books that made me yelp out loud in surprise when the twist happened, and I will forever recommend it because of how unique it was. The feel is reflective of The Road with the main part of the story showing a pained journey through a dangerous landscape. It also feels post-apocalyptic as these survivors struggle to cross the abandoned world that’s been overtaken by nature. The author wrote in a unique language that makes Idyll feel otherworldly but familiar too. All this blends together for really great world-building. I don’t want to give anything away, but there is a definite twist where the whole story flips into something different. You go from feeling like this is a Western to suddenly — Oh, yep, there’s the sci-fi!\n\nBy James Derry,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Idyll as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHold on tight for a New-Adult Sci-Fi Adventure that’s caught in the crossfire between Westworld and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road!\n\nIdyll is a rugged planet—a new, simpler start for some 10,000 settlers who have fled Mother Earth. But a strange ‘plague’ of contagious sleep has devastated their Settlement, sparked by a mysterious mantra called the Lullaby.\n\nAfter a three-year quarantine, Walt and Samuel Starboard set out from their ranch on a mission to cure their comatose mother and find their missing father. For days they ride through a blighted landscape: deserted cabins and gravestones and the ruins of towns destroyed…\n\nPreview\n\nBurning\n\nBy Heidi Catherine, Tamar Sloan,\n\nWhy did Sue-Ellen love this book?\n\nThe cover drew me in but I loved the worldbuilding in this book, both in the premise of what happened to our world (toxic oceans, anyone?) but also how characters now need to live and survive. And with great rising tension and twists, this was a book that left me reading much later in the night than I should have!\n\nI was drawn in by the 4 main characters – even when I wanted to slap them, I still wanted to know what was going to happen to them. And the way the society was set up really tore at my sense of ethics – a great thing to have in a dystopian book, I think…how does the new society sit with you?\n\nBy Heidi Catherine, Tamar Sloan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Burning as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOnly the chosen shall breed.\n\nIn a new world isolated by a rising, toxic sea, a single bridge connects Askala to the Outlands. Those who remain will need to pass a Proving to determine if they have the intelligence and heart to champion the future of their broken Earth.\n\nThose who succeed will become Bound, the ones chosen to breed.\n\nThose who fail, are Unbound. Free of responsibility, but robbed of their ability to bear children.\n\nFour young lives are born into this world. Magnus and Callix, two brothers determined to uphold this new order. Two brothers in love with…\n\nPreview\n\nAlias Space and Other Stories\n\nBy Kelly Robson,\n\nWhy did Ben love this book?\n\nThere’s a story in here about a former hockey player from the moon that had to move to Earth to try to avoid retribution after killing another player, and he gets stashed at an artist’s retreat. A big part of this list has been beautiful, but often very sad stories. Think, then, of Alias Space as a kind of antidote. If you have any familiarity with Robson from her published short fiction, this is a great collection to help you fill in the gaps in your collection. If you’ve never heard of Robson?
