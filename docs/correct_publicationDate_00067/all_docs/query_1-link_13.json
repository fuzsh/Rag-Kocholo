        "text": "London: Arthur Barker Ltd., 1979. First edition. Inscribed by the author on the title page: \"To Mike & Wendy Best wishes Douglas Adams.\" A Fine copy of the book in like dust jacket. Surprisingly scarce in the first edition and often found read to death. This copy with \"Capricorn One\" advertisement on the rear panel of the jacket, as required for the first issue. An exceptional copy.\n\nThe author's first book, and first in the series. “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" is an off-beat, sci-fi adventure book generally regarded as one of the most hilarious books written in the last fifty years. It has been wildly successful through its various radio, TV, stage, and film adaptations with millions of fans worldwide. A superb copy of this classic work of science fiction.\n\n“Humorous science fiction novels have notoriously limited audiences... The ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' is a delightful exception, being written for anyone who can understand the thrill that might come to a crew of interstellar explorers who discover a mysterious planet, dead for five million years, and then hear on their ''sub etha'' radio a ghostly voice, hollow, reedy, insubstantial: ''Greetings to you. ... This is a recorded announcement, as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment. ...'' (Contemporary New York Times Review) Fine in Fine dust jacket. (Item #1370)"
