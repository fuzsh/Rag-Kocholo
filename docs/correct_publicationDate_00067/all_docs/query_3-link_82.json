        "text": "Hiiiii\n\nSo I am doing some research into the science fiction genre in literature and I am looking for a book, published in the 21 cent., whose setting is in the outer space but the story should begin on Earth and only after should it move to the space (note: it is not the case that I knew of a book but forgot the name, I don't know if such a book exists but I guess it does, it's science fiction after all, the most prolific of all the genres...)\n\nDo you guys know a book like that?\n\nIf you want to know, I will analyze the following books:\n\nH.G.Wells - The First Men in the Moon (1901)\n\nC.S. Lewis - Out of the Silent Planet (1938)\n\nDouglas Adams - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979)\n\nSince my choises are not set in stone (though I would very much like to stick with The Guide), I am open to suggestions! As you can see, I am looking at different periods of science fiction writings (more specifically I am investigating the use of tenses and deixis, just an fyi), and looking at outer space settings with Earth as a starting point.\n\nAaaaanyways, ANY kind of suggestion would be great, because Scio me nihil scire\n\nThanks\n\nAlso being clear here, you want a single book (not part of a series) that was published between 1900 and 1999 and starts on Earth before moving into space for most of the book?\n\nMaybe you want that to be the focus - Space Travel rather than Space War or Alien Interaction?\n\nSomeone should look for a recent thread about \"The First Realistic Effort to Colonize Other Planets\" which might overlap with this."
