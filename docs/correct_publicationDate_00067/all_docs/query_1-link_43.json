        "text": "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a series of science fiction/comedy franchise created by English author Douglas Adams. The series started out as a radio broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978, but was then adapted into a series of novels as well as a TV series, stage plays, comic books, a computer game and a 2005 movie. The novels sold 15 million copies during Adams’ lifetime.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy book series began with the title novel in 1979. The “trilogy” would go on to last five books, plus one more written by Eoin Colfer in 2009. Below is a list of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy books in order of when they were originally published (and in chronological order):\n\nPublication Order of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Books\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy(1979)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Restaurant at the End of the Universe(1980)Amazon.com | Amazon.deLife, the Universe and Everything(1982)Amazon.com | Amazon.deSo Long, and Thanks for All the Fish(1984)Amazon.com | Amazon.deYoung Zaphod Plays It Safe(1986)Amazon.com | Amazon.deMostly Harmless(1992)Amazon.com | Amazon.deLive in Concert(1994)Amazon.com | Amazon.deAnd Another Thing...(2009)Amazon.com | Amazon.deThe Frood(2014)Amazon.com | Amazon.deSecondary Phase(2018)Amazon.com | Amazon.de\n\nNotes: And Another Thing… was written by Eoin Colfer based on the work of Douglas Adams.\n\nIf You Like Douglas Adams Books, You’ll Love…\n\nDiscworld\n\nDune\n\nEnder’s Game Saga\n\nWe do our best to get everything listed but the occasional book gets by us.
