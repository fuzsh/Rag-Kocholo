They both stand with a lot of similarities, but they also have a few differences. They had many similarities. Some similarities include where they were going.\n\nWhat was it about this one book that was life-changing for so many people? In order for a book to be life-changing, it must be relevant. The themes in To Kill a Mockingbird ring true of today’s issues, which perhaps says something about our progress or lack thereof concerning issues of racism, sexism, and class. However, I’d like to think that anyone who reads this book walks away more educated, and with fewer biases. But why should you, the reader, care?\n\nComparing The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\n\n1025 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the midst of the 20th century and the burgeoning space race, a new subgenre of science fiction began to blossom out of the seeds of pulp fiction, a genre insultingly deemed space opera (after the ever popular soap opera, which shares its taste for melodrama). Corny, ham-fisted, and oftentimes cliche, the beginnings of the genre were anything but pretty, yet there’s something undeniably entertaining about it. I recently rewatched Flash Gordon (the one with Queen in it) and it was an experience. In almost every respect, it's terrible -- poor acting, cheesy special effects, and laughable fight scenes --, but I was having an absolute blast. However clumsily, Flash Gordon managed to feed into the awe-inspiring appeal of a space opera.\n\nHowever, this seems to be remiss, as its lasting impact on both science fiction and people makes it worthy of study regardless (O’Dair).

By writing it in this way, the style of novel actually contributes towards the themes. Another way that Adams breaks the rules of science fiction novels while also building toward his themes is by removing all suspense. For example, in one of the climaxes in the book, Arthur Dent and the other characters accumulated are situated on the outside of a planet believed to be the legendary Magrathea with missiles flying at them, and Adams reveals the outcome of the events in\n\n“The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy,” by Douglas Adams, is about a man named arthur and his adventure throughout the galaxy.

He meets with his friend, Ford Prefect who is not from planet Earth but from a far away planet called Betelgeuse. Ford tells Arthur that the Earth is going to be totally destructed. Arthur does not believe him but listens anyway.\n\nComparing The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy '\n\n103 Words | 1 Pages\n\nIf I had to memorize a book or risk its extinction I would choose The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy because it is a humorous book that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

Douglas Adams the author was clearly a visionary incorporating elements such as “the book inside the book” and touch sensitive screens to entice audiences. The presentation today on this novel, was invaluable as it encouraged for a deeper understanding and awareness of cultural and contextual differences due to the time lapse. The process of working in a group, helped to facilitate a wide variety of perspectives due to the gender and cultural differences.
