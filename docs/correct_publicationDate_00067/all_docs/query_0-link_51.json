[and] over much too soon.ââThe Washington Post Book World\n\nSOON TO BE A HULU SERIES â¢Â Now celebrating the pivotal 42ndÂ anniversary of the original radio show on which the book was based.\n\nNominated as one of Americaâs best-loved novels by PBSâsÂ The Great American Read\n\nSeconds before Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition ofÂ The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the GalaxyÂ who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.\n\nTogether, this dynamic pair began a journey through space aided by a galaxyful of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebroxâthe two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian (formerly Tricia McMillan), Zaphodâs girlfriend, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; and Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens heâs bought over the years.\n\nWhere are these pens? Why are we born? Why do we die? For all the answers, stick your thumb to the stars!\n\nPraise for The Hitchhikerâs Guide to the Galaxy\n\nâA whimsical oddyssey . . . Characters frolic through the galaxy with infectious joy.ââPublishers Weekly\n\nâIrresistable!ââThe Boston Globe"
