I would like to say that RegRun has helped me on more than 1 occasion when it comes to spyware/adware by letting me know automatically that a piece of it got added to Windows startup. There is so much spyware/addware out there today it's hard to imagine being without RegRun. I like many other features too including the daily registry backups and file protection.
