There are no banners and no advertisement whatsoever on my site, where you will meet others that are interested in learning - and teaching - searching methodologies. You'll gain knowledge and power here that will enable you to search the web MUCH more effectively in the future.\n\nThe WORDS you have used for your search are contained somewhere in the huge 'catching list' below. But the PAGES you are searching for are hidden somewhere on the huge web. You'll learn here how to find them. Let's hope you will, one beautiful day, be a fisher instead of a fish and contribute yourself to our vast wealth of knowledge.\n\nPress your stop button now!"
