        "text": "Over the past 70 years, Borland Groover has grown into one of Florida’s largest gastroenterology clinics. We have more specialists, more locations and more hospital partnerships than most other gastrointestinal providers — all so we can deliver the most advanced treatments and the best patient care possible. That’s why so many primary care physicians refer their patients to us for digestive health care. Our physicians provide care for more than 100,000 patients each year with digestive disorders and conditions that include inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease including hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux disease, esophageal disorders and more. When it comes to colonoscopies, we’ve seen it all. Borland Groover physicians perform more than 50,000 colonoscopies a year, the only procedure used effectively for colon cancer prevention, and for diagnosing colonic disease. All of our gastroenterologists are board certified in both internal medicine and gastroenterology, and many have completed additional fellowships in hepatology and advanced endoscopy. Borland Groover physicians are well trained in all digestive disorders and diseases and utilize the most advanced treatments and therapies available. In addition, our research center performs various clinical studies each year, with more than 2,000 patients volunteering to participate in clinical trials that are responsible in bringing new drugs and therapies to market.
