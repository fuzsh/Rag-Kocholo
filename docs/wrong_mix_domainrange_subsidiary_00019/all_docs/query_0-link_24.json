        "text": "Hacking is the most genius field of computing science which is getting bigger with the passage of time. This research paper has the methods and techniques of hacking, types of hacking, types of hackers, types of hacking attacks, common tools of hacking, the geography of hackers, phases of hacking, protection processes, past reports, instruments of hacking and at last the future discussion on this field. This paper is enough to get to know some beginning information of hacking.\n\nExplosive growth of the Internet has brought many good things: electronic commerce, easy access to vast stores of reference material, collaborative computing, e-mail, and new avenues for advertising and information distribution, to name a few. As with most technological advances, there is also a dark side: criminal hackers. An ethical hacker is a computer and network expert who attacks a security system on behalf of its owners, seeking vulnerabilities that a malicious hacker could exploit. Governments, companies, and private citizens around the world are anxious to be a part of this revolution, but they are afraid that some hacker will break into their Web server and replace their logo with pornography, read their e-mail, steal their credit card number from an on-line shopping site, or implant software that will secretly transmit their organization's secrets to the open Internet. There are many techniques used to hack the information. This paper explores the ethics behind techniques of ethical hacking and whether there are problems that lie with this new field of work. In this paper we have discussed in detail history and types of hackers , different techniques used to hack the users, Operating System used in hacking , its pros and cons and a detail case study of J.P.Morgan.\n\nIn the cyber world more and more cyber-attacks are being perpetrated. Hackers have now become the warriors of the internet. They attack and do harmful things to compromised system. This paper will show the methodology use by hackers to gained access to system and the different tools used by them and how they are group based on their skills. It will identify exploits that can be used to attack a system and find mitigation to those exploits. In addition, the paper discusses the actual implementation of the hacking phases with the virtual machines use in the process. The virtual machines specification is also listed. it will also provide means and insights on how to protect one system from being compromised."
