        "text": "OMNY Health has announced it is partnering with several US gastroenterology (GI) practices to launch new real-world data (RWD) solutions, aiming to accelerate research and enhance care for millions of people with gastrointestinal diseases across the US.\n\nOMNY Health operates as a healthcare ecosystem, facilitating connections between providers and life sciences companies through the OMNY platform. This platform serves as a centralized resource for healthcare stakeholders to engage in data sharing and research services at scale. Building on this foundation, OMNY Health has launched a series of new GI RWD solutions in collaboration with leading US GI practices. The focus of this initiative is on accelerating research and improving outcomes for millions of individuals affected by GI diseases in the US.\n\nTo support these research partnerships on a large scale, OMNY’s GI data solutions aim to extract data from de-identified inpatient and ambulatory care electronic health records (EHRs). These solutions provide insights into factors such as disease severity, treatment decisions, efficacy, and the influence of social determinants on disease progression. By integrating diverse EHR data into unified, de-identified research data products, OMNY offers researchers and providers comprehensive information to address biomedical and population health research questions.\n\nMitesh Rao (CEO, OMNY Health) expressed enthusiasm about the expansion into gastroenterology, stating, “Over the past two years, we have made great strides connecting researchers and providers participating in our dermatology and ophthalmology research networks. We look forward to building on that impact in the field of gastroenterology.”\n\nThe partnership includes some of the most prominent community-based independent GI practices and integrated delivery networks (IDNs) in the US, encompassing over 5000 GI providers serving more than 10 million patients. This collaboration expands OMNY’s research network to over 380,000 providers and 75 million patients nationwide.\n\nUnited Digestive, Borland Groover, and OneGI are among the key partners expressing their commitment to leveraging data-driven approaches to enhance patient care. United Digestive’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr John Suh, hoped the partnership would, “allow us to drive further insights from our data to advance patient care.” Borland Groover’s CEO, Dr Kyle Etzkorn, echoed this sentiment, saying, “Our collaboration with OMNY not only aligns with our mission, but it also presents avenues to identify and pursue future opportunities for elevating GI patient care.” Through OMNY’s partnership, these practices aim to gain deeper insights into patient populations, care delivery patterns, and treatment outcomes, driving improvements in GI patient care. Christa Newton, MBA, CEO, OneGI, also highlighted the importance of RWD for enhancing patient care, stating,\n\n“Each piece of patient data is not just a statistic; it is a pathway to better outcomes, a testament to our commitment, and a source of inspiration for ongoing progress.”\n\nKey populations covered in OMNY’s GI offerings include ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, reflux disorders, and more. The data encompasses pharmacy orders, lab and diagnostic test results, comorbidities, symptom checklists, and provider clinical assessment scores."
