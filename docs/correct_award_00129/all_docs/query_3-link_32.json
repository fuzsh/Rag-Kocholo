        "text": "WHEN you open Google this morning you will see a doodle of a typewriter to celebrate the 127th anniversary of Nelly Sachs' birth.\n\nBut who is the playwright and Nobel Prize winner who fled Nazi Germany in the Second World War? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWho was Nelly Sachs?\n\nNelly Sachs was a Jewish poet and playwright from Germany, who fled to Sweden during the Second World War.\n\nKnown in her youth as Leonie, she was born 127 years ago - on December 10 1891 in Berlin, Germany.\n\nShe studied dance and literature as a child and went on to publish many works in German and Swedish.\n\nThe writer became a spokeswoman for the plight of her fellow Jews in Nazi Germany.\n\nShe and her mother fled to Sweden in 1940, a week before she was due to report to a concentration camp.\n\nSachs wrote many poems and plays about Jewish suffering under the Nazis and also worked as a translator to make money while she lived in Stockholm caring for her mother.\n\nShe suffered many nervous breakdowns after her mother's death and spent a number of years in a mental institution, where she continued to write.\n\nSachs won both the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Droste-Preis award.\n\nWhat did Nelly Sachs write?\n\nNelly Sachs published the following works of literature:\n\nLegenden und Erzählungen [Legends and Tales], 1921\n\nFahrt ins Staublose: Die Gedichte der Nelly Sachs 1 [Journey into the Dustless Realm: The Poetry of Nelly Sachs, 1], 1961\n\nSuche nach Lebenden: Die Gedichte der Nelly Sachs 2 [Search for the Living: The Poetry of Nelly Sachs, 2], 1971\n\nBriefe der Nelly Sachs [Letters of Nelly Sachs] ed. Ruth Dinesen and Helmut Müssener, 1984\n\nO the Chimneys: Selected Poems, Including the Verse Play, Eli, tr. Michael Hamburger et al., 1967\n\nThe Seeker and Other Poems. tr. Ruth Mead, Matthew Mead, and Michael Hamburger, 1970\n\nContemporary German Poetry, selections, ed. and tr. Gertrude C. Schwebell, 1964\n\nWhen did she win the Nobel Prize?\n\nIn 1966 Nelly Sachs was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nShe shared the prize with Shmuel Yosef Agnon, one of the central figures of modern Hebrew fiction.\n\nIt was divided between them equally \"for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people\" and \"for her outstanding lyrical and dramatic writing, which interprets Israel's destiny with touching strength.\"\n\nWhen Nelly Sachs was told about her winning the award on Oct. 21, 1966, she said: “Agnon represents the State of Israel. I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.”\n\nHow did Nelly Sachs die?\n\nShe died at the age of 78 on May 12 1970 of intestinal cancer.\n\nSachs had spent much time in hospital for her mental health after her mother died due to trauma from being persecuted by Nazis.\n\nWhy is she being celebrated with a Google Doodle?\n\nThe Google Doodle was created to celebrate the 127th anniversary of Nelly Sachs' death.\n\nThe doodle was illustrated by German/Finnish artist Daniel Stolle."
