Nelly Sachsâ suitcase reminds us of Europe during World War II and the escape of a mother and daughter from Nazi terror in Berlin to Sweden. The contents of the suitcase were the only things they carried with them. The suitcase has now been gifted to the museum by Swedish writer Aris Fioretos, who has owned it for the past fifteen years.",

        "text": "Aris FioretosÂ receivedÂ theÂ suitcase 15Â years ago from translator Margaretha Holmqvist, who was a close friend of Nelly Sachs. In 2010â2011, FioretosÂ served as the editor of the four-volume collected works of Nelly Sachs (Werke),Â publishedÂ by SuhrkampÂ in an annotated edition in Germany. In connection with the publication,Â there wasÂ aÂ largeÂ exhibition about SachsâÂ life and works,Â in which theÂ suitcaseÂ wasÂ displayed.\n\nâOne afternoon Margaretha invited me down to her basement,âÂ says Fioretos.Â âInÂ herÂ storageÂ spaceÂ was theÂ suitcase, slightly dusty and with a broken strap. It wasÂ cleaned upÂ and, of course,Â was ofÂ exemplaryÂ importance inÂ the exhibition. Now theÂ suitcase will find a home atÂ the Nobel Prize Museum, which can retell SachsâÂ story.Â This is a fineÂ way to take responsibility and preserve memories.â\n\nFrom a young age,Â Nelly Sachs was fascinated byÂ Swedish novelist and 1909Â literature laureate Selma LagerlÃ¶f, and the twoÂ were inÂ contactÂ byÂ letter. Selma LagerlÃ¶f helped Nelly SachsÂ toÂ escape from Berlin. SeveralÂ membersÂ of Nelly SachsâÂ immediate familyÂ becameÂ victims of the Holocaust. Nazi persecution left deep marks on SachsâÂ psyche and also influenced her writing.\n\nNelly SachsÂ was awardedÂ the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966Â âforÂ her outstanding lyrical and dramatic writing, which interprets Israelâs destiny with touching strengthâ. She was born on 10 December 1891 in Berlin and died on 12 May 1970 in Stockholm.\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\npress@nobelprize.org\n\nPress images can be found here.Â\n\nNobel Prize Museum\n\nThe Nobel Prize shows that ideas can change the world. The courage, creativity and perseverance of the Nobel Laureates inspire us and give us hope for the future. Films, in-depth tours, and artefacts tell the stories of the Laureates and their contributions âfor the greatest benefit to humankindâ. Based on the Nobel Prizeâs unique combination of fields â natural sciences, literature and peace â we examine the greatest challenges of our time and show how we can respond to them through science, humanism and collaboration. With our exhibitions, school programmes, lectures and conversations, we at the Nobel Prize Museum strive to engage the public in making a better world. Today we are located at Stortorget in Gamla Stan, Stockholmâs Old Town district. We are planning to create a new home for our public outreach activities at Slussen in downtown Stockholm.\n\nDisclaimer: Nobel Prize Museum is not directly or indirectly involved in the process of nominating or selecting Nobel Prize laureates.
