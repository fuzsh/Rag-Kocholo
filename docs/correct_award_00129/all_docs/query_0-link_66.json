After being terrorised by SA stormtroopers and subjected to looting and restrictions on her life, she managed to escape with her mother on one of the last civilian flights from Berlin in May 1940. All they managed to bring with them to Sweden was the clothes they were wearing and the contents of the suitcase that you can see in the picture.\n\nFrom a young age, Sachs was fascinated by Swedish novelist and 1909 literature laureate Selma Lagerlöf, and the two were in contact by letter. Lagerlöf helped Sachs to escape from Berlin. Several members of Sachs’ immediate family became victims of the Holocaust. Nazi persecution left deep marks on Sachs’ psyche and also influenced her writing. \n\nNelly Sachs was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966. \n\nSachs' suitcase has been donated to the Nobel Prize Museum (@nobelprizemuseum) in Stockholm, Sweden by Swedish writer Aris Fioretos who received the suitcase 16 years ago from translator Margaretha Holmqvist, a close friend of Sachs.\n\nPhoto: Sachs' suitcase.
