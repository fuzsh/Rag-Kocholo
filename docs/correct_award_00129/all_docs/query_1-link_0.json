        "text": "German literary prize\n\nThe Nelly Sachs Prize (German: Nelly Sachs Preis) is a literary prize given every two years by the German city of Dortmund. Named after the Jewish poet and Nobel laureate Nelly Sachs, the prize includes a cash award of €15,000. It honours authors for outstanding literary contributions to the promotion of understanding between peoples.[1][2]\n\nBecause there were not enough funds to honour an awardee in 2009, the prize was awarded in 2010. This was the first time that a year was skipped in the biennial schedule.[3]\n\nIn 2019, the judges for the 2019 award reversed their decision to give the prize to Kamila Shamsie, after the German website Ruhrbarone pointed out her long-standing public support for the BDS movement.[4][5][6] The Dortmund City Council, the hosts of the award stated: \"Shamsie's political positioning to actively participate in the cultural boycott as part of the BDS (Boycott Disinvestment Sanctions) campaign against the Israeli government is clearly in contradiction to the statutory objectives of the award and the spirit of the Nelly Sachs Prize.\"[7]\n\nIn response to the withdrawal, Shamsie said: \"In the just-concluded Israeli elections, Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to annex up to one third of the West Bank, in contravention of international law and his political opponent Benny Gantz's objection to this was that Netanyahu had stolen his idea; this closely followed the killing of two Palestinian teenagers by Israeli forces – which was condemned as 'appalling' by the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. In this political context, the jury has chosen to withdraw the award from me on the basis of my support for a non-violent campaign to bring pressure on the Israeli government.\"[4]\n\nAwardees[edit]\n\nYear Awardee Country 1961 Nelly Sachs Sweden 1963 Johanna Moosdorf [de] Germany 1965 Max Tau Norway 1967 Alfred Andersch Switzerland 1969 Giorgio Bassani Italy 1971 Ilse Aichinger Austria 1973 Paul Schallück [de] Germany 1975 Elias Canetti England 1977 Hermann Kesten United States 1979 Erich Fromm Germany 1981 Horst Bienek Germany 1983 Hilde Domin Germany 1985 Nadine Gordimer South Africa 1987 Milan Kundera France 1989 Andrzej Szczypiorski Poland 1991 David Grossman Israel 1993 Juan Goytisolo Spain 1995 Michael Ondaatje Canada 1997 Javier Marías Spain 1999 Christa Wolf Germany 2001 Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt France 2003 Per Olov Enquist Sweden 2005 Aharon Appelfeld Israel 2007 Rafik Schami Syria/Germany 2010 Margaret Atwood Canada 2011 Norman Manea[8] Romania 2013 Abbas Khider Iraq/Germany 2015 Marie NDiaye[9] France 2017 Bachtyar Ali Iraq 2019 Not awarded 2021 Katerina Poladjan [de] Germany 2023 Saša Stanišić[10] Bosnia/Germany\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
