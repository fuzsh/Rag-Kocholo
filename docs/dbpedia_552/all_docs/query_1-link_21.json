        "text": "Species from the Zantedeschia genus, described almost 200 years ago, belong to the numerous picture family Araceae, in which the inflorescence is a spadix with numerous small flowers set on a succulent stem surrounded by a colourful inflorescence spathe. Initially, the cultivation was dominated by Zantedeschia aethiopica /L./ Spreng. Its importance is currently low and cultivars with colourful inflorescence spathes derived from Z. rehmanii Engl., Z. elliottiana (W. Wats.) Engl. and Z. albomaculata (Hook.) Baill, among others, are becoming increasingly important. Their obtainment was possible thanks to intensive breeding work carried out initially in the United States of America and New Zealand, and later in South Africa and the Netherlands. The cultivar range is large. The yield of cut flowers that can be obtained from them is often not very satisfactory and is not compensated by the price that can be obtained from the sale of flowers."
