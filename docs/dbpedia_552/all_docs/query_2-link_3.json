There is not much information available with regards to postharvest treatments, and this is the sort of info i am looking for. Zantedeschia \"Flame\", is Z.elliottiana, it is a group 2 Zant., the colour is Flame-yellow, it doesn't have a dark throat,the leaves have maculations, and the average height is 50-60cm. Perhaps you should consider, getting , breeding or obtaining the orange cultivars, these were big sellers in Japan this year. The New Zealand Calla council is telling the growers to plant,c.v.\"Treasure\", \"Mango\",\"Hazel Marie\". However, you did not hear that from me.\n\nFrom: STEPHEN FORD,(FOOTBRIDGE FLOWERS)\n\nEmail: lford@clear.net.nz.\n\nHI, WERE SPECIALISTS IN WINTER AND SUMMER TYPES AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR ERWINIA FREE GROWING PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN NZ FOR KIWI GROWERS.\n\nFrom: Vladimir Puntel\n\nEmail: vladf@tba.com.br\n\nHi, my name is Vladimir and I'm from Brazil.

I kept it in the little pot it came in until June, at which point I transferred it to a larger pot. It survived the transfer and continued blooming until mid-July. I keep it on a windowsill where it gets morning sun and I water it faithfully, but the leaves are starting to get limp and dry. Do I need to let it die back and lie dormant for a while in order for the bulb to rejuvinate? Is there anything I can do? If this plant dies, I will be devastated. I don't have many plants, so any basic advice will be heeded and appreciated.
