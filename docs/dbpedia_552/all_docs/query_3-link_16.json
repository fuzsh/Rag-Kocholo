        "text": "Several biological control agents for the control of fungal diseases have recently been commercialized. Do the claims of pest control meet the expectations of the growers? Do the biocontrol agents perform consistently? How do they compare to chemicals? These questions have yet to be answered but recent trials indicate mixed results. In Massachusetts, Mycostop worked well against fusarium stem rot but not against fusarium wilt. Deny (Burkholderia cepacia) did not perform well against Rhizoctonia or Pythium root rot of poinsettia. The following information was taken from the 1997 and 1998 Biological and Cultural Tests for Control of Plant Diseases. In Maryland, zinnia damping-off was controlled by both SoilGard (Gliocladium virens) and Bio-Trek (Trichoderma harzianum). The biocontrols performed as well as the conventional fungicide. In North Carolina, GlioGard (Gliocladium virens) and SoilGard gave only partial control against Pythium and Rhizoctonia damping-off of bedding plants. In ...\n\nDevelopment of bio-intensive module was carried out at Agricultural Research Station (ARS), Virinjipuram for a period of two years during 2017-19 in kharif and rabi against viral and phytoplasma diseases of brinjal. The module thus developed was tested in two locations viz., ARS farm, Virinjipuram and at farmers' field to assess the performance of Bio-intensive Integrated Disease Management (BIDM) module against the mosaic, little leaf disease and whitefly during Kharif 2020. The results revealed that the BIDM was found superior in minimising the mosaic incidence in both locations tested and recorded 5.16 and 6.12 per cent also with lowest little leaf incidence. The lowest whitefly population was also recorded in bio-intensive module adopted plots when compared to farmers' practice at all stages of crop growth. At 30 days after transplanting (DAT), the whitefly population of 4.45 and 3.77 number per plant was recorded at ARS, Virinjipuram and at farmers' field. With respect to fruit yield, an adoption of bio-intensive module registered a significantly higher yield both at ARS farm (34.02 t/ha) and at farmers' field (30.36 t/ha) coupled with higher benefit cost ratio of 5.84 and 5.18 where as in farmers' practice the lowest fruit yield of 31.71 t/ha with BC ratio of 5.57 at ARS farm and 25.68 t/ha of fruit yield with CB ratio of 1:4.43 in farmers' field were recorded.\n\nA field experiment was conducted to evaluate the agronomic performance and resistance of Gladiolus germplasm against corm rot disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. f. sp. gladioli (L. Masey) W.C. Snyder & H.N. Hans. Among the 23 Gladiolus varieties tested, Glad Red exhibited the highest spike length of 55 cm followed by Advanced Red (50.2 cm) and White Prosperity (49.5 cm). Highest number of flowers (13 per spike) was recorded in Rose Supreme, Jester Ruffled Yellow, Princess Margaret Rose and Chinon. Glad Red depicted highest field life of flowers (42.5 days), followed by Friendship (42.5 days), Peter Pears (38.7 days) and Chinon (37.3 days). Different varieties showed 6.6 – 56.6% disease incidence and 0 – 33.3% mortality. Advanced Red, White Prosperity, Violetta, San Remo and Yellow Glad were found comparatively more resistant to corm rot disease with disease incidence of 0 – 10%. Indian variety Aarti was found to be the most susceptible to corm rot disease with disease in...\n\nPlants are continuously exposed to certain biotic and a biotic stresses, causing serious crop losses every year. Prevailing situation is representing today a serious threat to global food security and safety. Any professional plant pathologist needs to have theoretical as well as practical knowledge and a clear understanding of plant diseases and of the factors involved, knowing how to discover effective control means. This chapter has been designed to provide the reader a brief overview regarding the concept of plant diseases, their diagnosis and the threats they pose to crop production and protection. Here we discuss and focus on basic principles including: plant disease management, conventional and advanced methods of controlling diseases and integration of various control measures, historical perspectives, disease management in the current era, future directions and challenges.\n\nFor the first time 59 rinds, 11 forms and 1 variation of fungi-pathogens in 15 types of flowers grown in the conditions of Namangan regions were defined. Infection of selected flowers by 81 kinds of fungi-pathogens was determined. For the first time in the conditions of our republic on 15 types of flowers was used Trichoderma viride as a biological method and such kind of fungicides as Maksim, Baileton, Fundazol in controlling of defined diseases as chemical method and economic efficiency of these measures were estimated."
