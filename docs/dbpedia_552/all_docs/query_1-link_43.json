        "text": "Zantedeschia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. They are indigenous to Southern Africa. Common names include Arum Lily, Calla and Calla Lily although it is neither a true lily (Liliaceae), nor an Arum nor a Calla (related genera in Araceae). In Afrikaans some common names include Aronskelk and Varkoor. It has often been used in paintings, and is visible in many of Diego Rivera’s works of art. Zantedeschia species are rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plants with a showy, inflorescence consisting of a showy white, yellow or pink spathe shaped like a funnel with a yellow, central, finger-like spadix. Currently 8 true species are recognized, these being Zantedeschia aethiopica (Giant White Arum Lily or Common Arum Lily), Zantedeschia albomaculata (Spotted Leaved White Arum Lily), Zantedeschia elliottiana (Yellow or Golden Arum Lily), Zantedeschia jucunda, Zantedeschia odorata, Zantedeschia pentlandii, Zantedeschia rehmannii (Pink Arum Lily) and Zantedeschia valida. All Zantedeschias produce large, showy flowers that are often grown both as ornamental plants and for cut flowers. Zantedeschia are cold hardy plants, but some are more winter-hardy than others. The white Zantedeschia aethiopica and some of its relatives can survive at minimum winter temperatures below -23°C.\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica Marshmallow, is an arum lily is well known for its striking appearance when in flower, with a brilliant pink floral bract wrapping around a yellow spadex or floral spike in the centre bearing tiny flowers. The flowering parts arise from a ring of glossy green leaves. Due to its striking inflorescences, Zantedeschia aethiopica Marshmallow is very popular as cut flowers and as an ornamental in a pot or the garden."
