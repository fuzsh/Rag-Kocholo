        "text": "The Marmarica Plateau, which is situated on both sides of the Libyan-Egyptian border, has significant historical and ecological importance. Nevertheless, its botanical components have not been updated or reviewed recently. This paper aims to study the floristic composition of the plateau on the Libyan side by a comprehensive review of the five most detailed studies conducted in the area during the period 1930−2008. The study area covers only 3.4% of the Libyan territory, while the plant inventory at the species level comprises 31% (642/2082) of the National flora. Plant life-form is dominated by therophytes (60.7%) and chamaephytes (23.7%). Seven taxa are new records for the Libyan flora, 14 are alien, 28 were cultivated, and 37 taxa are endemic or near-endemic to the Libyan flora and nearby countries. A total of 225 taxa have not been recorded since 1930, which revealed that they are scarce and may have gone locally extinct due to climatic and unsustainable anthropogenic stresses. Another possibility is that these taxa may be incorrectly identified in the original publications, and this data have never been updated. The present study highlighted the richness and importance of the flora in the Libyan part of the Marmarica Plateau, necessitating conservation intervention, particularly for protecting endemic and rare plants and the biodiversity hotspots.\n\nBiscutella L. ser. Biscutella (= Biscutella ser. Lyratae Malin.) comprises mostly annual or short-lived perennial plants occurring in the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East, which exhibit some diagnostic floral features. Taxa in the series have considerable morphological plasticity, which is not well correlated with clear geographic or ecologic patterns. Traditional taxonomic accounts have focused on a number of vegetative and floral characters that have proved to be highly variable, a fact that contributed to taxonomic inflation mostly in northern Africa. A detailed study and re-evaluation of morphological characters, together with recent phylogenetic data based on concatenation of two plastid and one nuclear region sequence data, yielded the basis for a taxonomic reappraisal of the series. In this respect, a new comprehensive integrative taxonomic arrangement for Biscutella ser. Biscutella is presented in which 10 taxa are accepted, namely seven species and three additional v...\n\nThe census of the loci classici of 1,400 Italian endemic vascular plants (i.e. not thriving elsewhere with the exception of Corsica and Malta) is here presented and described. The effective place of publication of accepted names, basionyms and homotypic synonyms were identified and critically verified. This often resulted in some change in authorship attribution and, in seven cases, in validation problems (Asperula cynanchica var. lactea var. nov., A. lactea comb. nov., Biscutella laevigata subsp. raffaelliana subsp. nov., Ferulago nodosa subsp. geniculata comb. & stat. nov., Limonium tineoi comb. nov., L. usticanum sp. nov., Noccaea torreana comb. nov.). The geographic information on the loci classici was excerpted from the protologues, as well as information on typification for the taxa described before 1 January 1958. The names without holotype are 796. For 347 names a lecto- or neo-typification is available in literature, while 449 currently accepted taxa still need of type designation."
