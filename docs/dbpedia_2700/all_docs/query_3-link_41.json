        "text": "Art. 3. Ranks are discussed in Arts. 3, 4 and 5. The principal suprageneric ranks are kingdom, division or phylum, class, order and family (Art. 3).\n\nArt. 4. The rank of tribe may be inserted between family and genus (Art. 4.1). The sanctioned additional ranks are formed typically by adding the prefix \"-sub\" to form subkingom, subdivision or subphylum, subclass, suborder, subfamily and subtribe (Art. 4.2). Additional suprageneric ranks may be established as long as they do not cause confusion (Art. 4.3). Many modern authors have adopted the use of the rank superorder, and there is a growing movement for the use of supertribe (especially in Poaceae). A small number of workers have adopted superkingdom. My own view is that the prefix \"super-\" should be restricted to suprageneric names.\n\nArt. 5. The relative order of the ranks may not be altered (Art. 5). Thus, in their full extent at the moment, the ranks in use are: superkingdom, kingdom, subkingdom, superdivision, division, subdivision, superclass, class, subclass, superorder, order, suborder, superfamily, family, subfamily, supertribe, tribe and subtribe.\n\nArt. 16. Art. 16 was redrafted in the St. Louis Code making the provisions and nature of names above the rank of family much clearer. Art. 16.1 defines \"automatically typified names\" and \"descriptive names.\" Examples are provided. New Art. 16.2 indicates that for automatically typified names, the typical subdivision of a higher rank is to be based on the type of the higher taxon. Using Magnoliophyta as an example, the names would be as follows:\n\nDivision Magnoliophyta Cronquist, Takht. & Zimmerm. ex Reveal\n\nSubdivision Magnoliophytina Frohne & U. Jensen ex Reveal\n\nClass Magnoliopsida Brongn.\n\nSubclass Magnoliidae Novák ex Takht.\n\nSuperorder Magnolianae Takht.\n\nOrder Magnoliales Bromhead\n\nSuborder Magnoliineae Engl.\n\nAnother, more complex example is the suprafamilial ranks associated with Solanaceae in some systems of classification:\n\nDivision Magnoliophyta Cronquist, Takht. & Zimmerm. ex Reveal\n\nSubdivision Magnoliophytina Frohne & U. Jensen ex Reveal\n\nClass Rosopsida Batsch\n\nSubclass Lamiidae Takht. ex Reveal\n\nSuperorder Lamianae Takht.\n\nOrder Lamiales Bromhead\n\nSuborder Solanineae Engl.\n\nNote the terminations. All but the one for superorder (\"-anae\") are recommended by the Code when a name is based on a generic type (Rec. 161.2 & 3). However, at present their use is not mandatory. The proposal submitted in St. Louis to require these terminations (including that for superorder) was referred to a Special Committee. Some terminations differ when the plant is an algal or a fungus (Rec. 16A). It is important to remember that while names above the rank of family are not subject to the principle of priority (Note 2.), in choosing among typified names for such ranks, it is recommended authors generally follow the principle of priority (Rec. 16B.1).\n\nNew Art. 16.3 makes it clear that names published with an incorrect Latin termination are to be corrected. For example, \"Cactarieae\" (Dumortier, 1829, based on Cactaceae) is to be corrected to Cactales Dumort.). A new example states that suprageneric names published with a non-Latin ending are not to be accepted: \"Acoroidées\" (Kirschl., Fl. Alsace 2: 103. 1853-Jul 1857) is not to be accepted as \"Acorales Kirschl.\", because it has a French rather than a Latin termination. The name Acorales was later validated by Reveal (in Phytologia 79: 72. 1996). This corresponds to the last statement in Art. 16.3 that name \"published with a non-Latin termination...are not validly published.\" Left vague in the Code is the situation when an author who uses French terminations for all other ranks uses both the Latin and French termination \"-ales\" for orders. The proposal submitted to St. Louis to make clear that ordinal names published with the French \"-ales\" were to be considered as not validly published was left in limbo.\n\nNOTE: I submitted a proposed clarification of the Code regarding the use of illegitimate generic names as a type for suprafamilials name for consideration at the St. Louis nomenclatural session. At the session, the proposed rewording of the Rapporteurs properly was accepted with the understanding that the final wording would to be established by the Editorial Committee. For some reason, the provision, which was to mirror Art. 18.3, and the following example were not entered into the St. Louis Code:\n\nThe names Caryophyllidae Takht. (Sist. Filog. Cvetk. Rast.: 144. 1967), Caryophyllanae Takht. (Sist. Filog. Cvetk. Rast.: 144. 1967) and Caryophyllales Perleb (Naturgesch. Pflanzenr.: 312. 1826) are legitimate because the family Caryophyllaceae Juss. (Gen. Pl.: 299. 1789) is conserved, even though its type, Caryophyllus Mill. (1754) non L. (1753), is illegitimate.\"\n\nArt 17. This article is now reduced to two provisions. The first establishes the endings for names at the ranks of order (\"-ales\") and suborder {\"-ineae\"). The second permits to use of certain classical terms such as \"cohors,\" \"nixus,\" \"alliance,\" and \"Reihe\" when proposed in a position equivalent to order to be considered as having been published at the rank of order.\n\nArt. 18. This article deals with the establishment of family names. With the exception of a few alternative names (see Art. 18.5), all family names end in \"-aceae\" (Art. 18.1). Names of families proposed with their rank denoted by the term \"order\" or \"natural order\" (or an equivalent expression in another language) are to be considered as having been proposed at the rank of family (Art. 18.2). Family names based on an illegitimate generic name are themselves illegitimate but may be validly published (Art. 18.3). The example, however, makes clear that while Caryophyllus Mill. and Wintera Murray are illegitimate, the family names Caryophyllaceae and Winteraceae are legitimate because they have been conserved (see App. IIB). Any name published with a non-Latin ending is invalid (Art. 18.4). Thus, many of the names originally published in French and German, but often accepted today, are invalid.\n\nThe Code allows certain alternative names. These are classical names long in use, in some cases, even before 1753. Each alternative name is typified by the type of the name it is alternative to. For example, Brassicaceae Lindl. is the correct name for the mustard family; it is typified on the genus Brassica. The alternative name for Brassicaceae is Cruciferae Adans. Note that Cruciferae is the alternative name, not Brassicaceae. As presently given in App. IIB of the Code, this is confusing. The alternative family names are: Palmae (Arecaceae), Compositae (Asteraceae), Cruciferae (Brassicaceae), Gramineae (Poaceae), Guttiferae (Clusiaceae), Labiatae (Lamiaceae), Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and Umbelliferae (Apiaceae). When the Fabaceae are circumscribed in a sense so as to exclude the Caesalpiniaceae and the Mimosaceae, the alternative name Papilionaceae may be used.\n\nArt. 19. This article deals with names at the ranks of subfamily, tribe and subtribe. With one exception (see Art. 19.7), all names at the rank of subfamily are formed like those of family names (Art. 18.1) but end in \"-oideae\" instead of \"-aceae\" (Art. 19.1). In parallel to Art. 18.2, names intended as subfamilies but proposed as \"suborder\" are to be treated as if they were published as subfamilies.\n\nThe terminations for names at the ranks of tribe and subtribe are \"-eae\" and \"-inae\" respectively (Art. 19.3).\n\nArt. 19.4 is a confusing statement at the moment, and one that will require clarification in the future. The intent is to instruct authors that when they adopt a family names, they are to use names at the lower ranks (subfamily, tribe and subtribe) based on the same generic stem. Thus, the following example (with the correct authorships):\n\nThe type of the family name Rosaceae Adans. is Rosa L. and hence the subfamily and tribe which include Rosa are to be called Rosoideae Arn. and Roseae Lam. & DC.\n\nOne could also add here Rosinae J. Presl to complete the sequence of available names and ranks.\n\nOther authorship corrections to examples 2-4 are: Pooideae Benth. (Ex. 2); Ericoideae Link, Ericeae DC. ex Duby, Rhododendroideae (Juss.) Sweet, Rhodoreae DC. ex Duby and Rhododendreae Colla (Ex. 3); and Asteroideae (Cass.) Lindl., Asterinae (Cass.) Dumort. Cichorioideae Chevall., Cichorieae Lam. & DC. and Cichoriinae Cass. ex Dumort. (Ex. 4).\n\nSome authors have suggested recently that Art. 19.4 refers to the validity of names. I disagree. An example of this is as follows:\n\nWhen Bentham (J. Proc. Linn. Soc., Bot. 5(Suppl. 2): 87. 1861) proposed Casearieae in the family Samydaceae Vent., he should have used Samydeae (Vent.) Dumort. (1829) as his Casearieae included both Casearia Jacq. and Samyda Jacq. Bentham's use of Casearieae is contrary to Art. 19.4, but this in and of itself does not render Casearieae invalid. Casearieae is not nomenclaturally superfluous and thus illegitimate because of Art. 52.3. Bentham's name was associated with a brief description in Latin and was properly published so that it is otherwise validly published. Finally, suprageneric names are mononomials, not combinations (a term restricted to names below the rank of genus - see Art. 6.7), and thus for purposes of validly, Bentham's name is validly published, but in this particularly classification scheme, it is not available.\n\nArt. 19.5 is parallel to Art. 18.3 and to the missing provision that was to have been included in Art. 16. In short, as long as Caryophyllaceae, based on the illegitimate generic name Caryophyllus Mill. is conserved, one may adopt Caryophylloideae Arn. and Caryophylleae Lam. & DC.\n\nThe new wording in Art. 19.6 makes clear that improper Latin terminations may be corrected without alteration of the authorship or date of publication. However, names proposed with non-Latin terminations are not validly published. Finally, Art. 19.7 permits the use of an alternative name, Paplionoideae L. ex DC. when one adopts the alternative family name Papilionaceae Giseke. Both names are typified on Faba Mill., the type of Fabaceae Lindl.\n\nAuthorship corrections to Rec. 19A, Ex. 2 are: Pyroloideae Kostel. and Pyroleae Dumort., Monotropoideae Arn. and Monotropeae Dumort., and Vaccinioideae Arn. and Vaccinieae Rchb.\n\nArt. 32. Contrary to often accepted practice, all names regardless of rank must be accompanied by a validating description or diagnosis. Numerous modern authors simply use suprageneric names without concern for their validity (Art. 32.1).\n\nAfter 1 Jan 1953 there must be a full and direct reference to the basionym or to any validating Latin description or diagnosis (Art. 32.4). Mere mention of an author's name, or citation of a reference in the work does not constitute and full and direct reference.\n\nAn aspect of the Code that nearly everyone finds difficult is how indirect can an indirect reference be and still be a reference. While Art. 32.4 provides a concise definition, the examples associated with Arts. 32.4 provide considerable guidance. Art. 32 Ex. 5 clearly states that an indirect reference can be as simply as an author's name, while Ex. 7 reminds us that an indirect reference may be nothing more than a statement in the text alluding to another work with effectively published descriptions or diagnoses. These are relatively straight forward but often require reviewing an entire work for evidence of validity and not just the place where the name appears.\n\nIn the case of many suprageneric names one finds the reference in the form of a name, typically a descriptive name associated with one based on a generic stem. An example is Altingiaceae Horan. (Tetractys: 25. 1843) who gave only the expression \"(Altingiaceae (s. Balsamifluae)).\" To the uninformed this may appear to be a nom. nud., but in fact \"Balsamifluae\" refers to an invalidly published (Art. 18.1) Blume & J. Fischer (Fl. Javae 17-18: 3. 1829) name associated with an effectively published description (see Art. 32.1(c)). As such there is an indirect reference to a description or diagnosis.\n\nEarly authors who were particularly prolific, like Cassini, often evolved in both their use of ranks and in the use of Latinized names. Thus, when a subsequent author refers to '\"Cass.'\" for a name in a new rank, one can rarely be certain which of Cassini's many works they used. Cassini initially used sections within three families that he later considered to be tribes in one family. He also published his names in both Latin and French. Thus, it can make a difference as to whether the name, say, at the rank of subfamily is a new name or one in which rank is finally assigned to a Cassini name.\n\nFor example, Alismatoideae Lam. & DC. ex Arn. (Encycl. Brit., ed. 7, 5: 136. 1832) is accompanied by a description in English, so it is validate by this action alone. Nonetheless, he attributes the name to Lamarck and Candolle who proposed the unranked name Alismoideae Lam. & DC. (Syn. Pl. Fl. Gall.: 155. 1806) which is associated with a brief description in Latin. Accordingly, I have given the above authorship. A somewhat more complex example is the following: Pfeiffer validated the subtribe Athanasinae (Less.) Lindl. ex Pfeiff., (Nomencl. Bot. 1(1): 323. 1872) by providing a reference to an invalidly (Art. 33.5) published A.P. de Candolle (in J. Lindley, Intr. Nat. Syst. Bot., ed. 2: 260. 1836, as Division \"Athanasieae\") name that might seem to be a nom. nud., but in fact is associated by an indirect reference to the unranked name Athanasieae Less. ( Syn. Gen. Compos.: 262. 1832) with a brief description in Latin.\n\nIn dealing with suprageneric names, one must have a full understanding of the literature to evaluate the validity of these names.\n\nSuprageneric names published with an incorrect Latin termination are to be corrected (Art. 32.5). Priority resides with who proposed the name, not with whom first supplied the correct ending.\n\nArt. 33. Art. 33.3 applies only to \"new combinations or avowed substitutes.\" It allows errors in bibliographic citation to be corrected. No such provision exists specifically for suprageneric names except that most \"transfers\" of rank (e.g., from tribe to subfamily) are to be treated as \"avowed substitutes\" and therefore Art. 33.3 can be applicable. Nonetheless, its principle has been applied to all ranks traditionally, and in the present review of suprageneric names.\n\nArt. 33.7 appears to be largely unknown to most users of suprageneric names. A taxon proposed at a misplaced rank is not validly published. Numerous present-day authors attribute the rank of tribe to names actually proposed as sections. Likewise, it is not uncommon to find the rank family recognized within a natural order (=family, see Arts. 18.2 and 19.2); such secondary names are invalid.\n\nArt. 35. This article deals with indication of rank. This is particularly troublesome in the early literature. After 1 Jan 1953, a rank must be stated, but before that date, it is open to interpretation.\n\nNames published without a rank, or merely a term (e.g., Gruppe) are rankless, but often still validly published. For purposes of priority, this is fixed when a rank (Arts. 3-5) is attributed to a name. Art. 35.4 is often ignored. If a name is not given a rank on one page, but names are given ranks elsewhere in the same publication (or different parts of the work), then rank might be established. More often, all names are rankless except in the discussion the author refers to a specific rank (e.g., all of Bartling's (1830) names below the rank of family are seemingly rankless; only in two places, and then in discussion, does he use a rank--tribe).\n\nOften ranks are given but not in a consistent fashion. Lindley (1836) frequently referred to one of his families as a \"tribe\" but not in the sense of a rank. Below the rank of family he used tribe and section, yet in other instances no rank at all. In such cases, the names may be (a) valid, (b) invalid, and (c) rankless but valid providing all other appropriate provisions of the Code were fulfilled.\n\nThe newly established Art. 35.2 will resolve some of the difficulties. Seemingly rankless names proposed after 1 Jan 1908, when ranks were formally established in the Code are to be considered as having a rank if the termination corresponds with those listed in Rec. 16A1-3, Art. 17.1, 18.1, 19.1 and 19.3 and is position is not in conflict with the order of ranks established in Arts. 3-5. The two examples help explain Art. 35.2:\n\nJussieu (Mém. Mus. Hist. Nat. 12: 497. 1827) proposed Zanthoxyleae without specifying the rank. Although he employed the present termination for tribe (-eae), that name, being published prior to 1908, is unranked. Zanthoxyleae Dumort. (Anal. Fam. Pl.: 45. 1829), however, is a tribal name, as Dumortier specified its rank.\n\nNakai (Chosakuronbun Mokuroku [Ord. Fam. Trib. Nov.], 1943) validly published the names Parnassiales, Lophiolaceae, Ranzanioideae, and Urospatheae. He indicated the respective ranks of order, family, subfamily, and tribe, by virtue of their terminations, even though he did not mention these ranks explicitly.\n\nArt. 36. Contrary to often accepted practice, all names regardless of rank proposed after 1 Jan 1935 must be accompanied by a validating description or diagnosis in Latin. Numerous modern authors have proposed suprageneric names without concern for this requirement. For example, when Cronquist, Takhtanjan and Zimmermann proposed \"Magnoliophyta\" in their 1966 Taxon article, they cited as the basis of their name a validly published 1862 name, but one that was associated with a description in German rather than Latin. As a result their name was not validly published. It was formally validated several years later, but long after it had become widely accepted."
