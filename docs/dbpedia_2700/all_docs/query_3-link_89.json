        "text": "In two previous posts I have talked about:\n\nThe Characteristics of Eudicots and The Characteristics of Monocots\n\nThey are a major split in the division of flowering plants, and the majority of succulents discussed on partial-sun​ are one or the other. Today I am going to compare and contrast these differences to highlight how these two types of plants develop differently and maybe even arm you with the knowledge to be able to tell the difference between eudicots and monocots that you encounter in the real world.\n\nA germinating mango seed with its cotyledon emerging\n\n1st Major Difference: Number of Cotyledons\n\nAs discussed previously in both The Characteristics of Eudicots and The Characteristics of Monocots, the base of this distinction between the two groups is based on the number of cotyledons it produces when germinating.\n\nA Cotyledon is: an embryonic leaf that develops to absorb all the stored nutrients that are packed into the seed, before the plant is able to grow true leaves.\n\nThe number of cotyledons a plant produces varies from 1-24 depending on the species but ALL MONOCOTS ONLY PRODUCE ONE, AND ALL EUDICOTS ONLY PRODUCE TWO. This isn’t a very practical example but it’s what the typological distinction is based on. And using this information we are able to think about plant sprouts that we interact with in our daily lives, like alfalfa sprouts and realize that they are eudicots. This is because the sprout itself is actually the plant’s two leaved cotyledon and two leaved cotyledons are a trademark of eudicots.\n\n2nd Major Difference: Growth Habits\n\nThe most practical difference between monocots and eudicots are their growth habits, which are in most cases easily observed and able to be classified as a trait of one of the two groups. Sometimes although you need to inspect more closely than what a trait might come off as. But here are some things to keep in mind.\n\nTrue woody trunks and stems are a eudicot trait.\n\nA plant developing a woody trunk is a display of secondary growth, which is the ability for a plant to thicken it’s stems and branches. MONOCOTS DONT EXHIBIT THIS CHARACTERISTIC. Although monocots still sometimes have thick stems that may appear woody (think palm trees, which are monocots), these are not truely woody stems and are often just the remaining bases of former leaves who have been shed or have a fibrous covering that is distinctly different from tree bark. Or they may even have a epidermal layer that mimics the texture of bark, but it cannot be pulled off because its not dead tissue, like real bark. It should also be noted that you shouldn’t poke holes or damage the stems or trunks of monocots because they are unable to repair that kind of damage and harms the plant.\n\nSimple Unbranching Rosettes with strap-shaped leaves are a monocot trait.\n\nA plant that grows either low to the ground with no or a reduced stem, OR tall on an unbranching stem with no lower growth is typical of monocots, because they grow only one leaf at a time, just like their cotyledon. Each new leaf grows up from the center of the stem and then out to be succeeded by other new leaves. This growth pattern is also often why monocots also grow in rosette shapes, like Agaves and Aloes, so that their leaves don’t overlap each other. BRANCHING IS *mostly* A EUDICOT CHARACTERISTIC. Eudicots often and seemingly randomly send off new branches from their main stem which is why most deciduous trees have a number of branches that are able to grow in different directions, while the original main stem is able to continue on growing independently. Eudicots also often have more complicated leave shapes and are not usually as strap shaped as many monocots. *NOTE* Monocots actually ARE able to branch, but they do do differently than eudicots do. Monocots branch dichotomously, which means that the stem is literally CLEAVED symmetrically into two new twin stems. They are both the continuations of the main stem. Most monocots don’t branch , but when they do it is always in this way.\n\nI like to think about the difference as being: when a eudicot branches it is a “+1″, but when a monocot branches it’s a “÷2″\n\n3rd Major Difference: Leaf Connections\n\nAnother major difference between eudicots and monocots is how their leaves connect to the stems. Eudicots have leaves that are connected to the stems in a similar way to how they branch, with the leaves literally branching directly off of the stems. This means that when leaves fall off of eudicot stems they leave a mark or a scar of where that leaf was, making eudicot stems have a pattern from former leaves. On the other hand, the leaves of monocots are attached with a sheath that wraps either partly or completely around the stem, making it a different type of connection that leaves no trace of the leaf on the stem.\n\n4th Major Difference: Parallel vs. Netted\n\nThe last visible leaf characteristic that differentiates monocots from eudicots is the differences between their leaf patterns. Leaf patterns could be either the actual coloration of the leaves or the patterns that the veins make in the leaves. Once again these patterns refer back to the reoccuring patterns that both groups exhibit. Eudicots have leaf patterns that are netted, which means branched essentially, so the veins fork readily, like a maple leaf for example. Monocots however, have parallel leaf patterns meaning that the veins in their leaves are all long and unbranching, and do not cross. These types of markings and patterns can be obvious in some species and confusing or seemingly wrong in others, so don’t use this as your sole method of identification.\n\n5th Major Difference: Number of Flower Parts\n\nAnother trait of eudicots is that all species have flowers with parts in multiples of either four or five. And monocots have flowers with parts in multiples of three. This is most easily observed in regards to flower petals, especially when you think about a flower like a daisy, which is a eudicot. Daisys always have lots of petals, but if you were to count them, chances are that they would either have 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, or 25+ petals, because thats just how these plants work. Or a flower like a lily, which is a monocot. Lilies always have few of petals, but if you were to count them, chances are that they would either have 3 or 6 petals. But there are also plenty of monocots and eudicots out there that have more simple flowers, and may not even appear to be “traditional flowers” at all."
