<strong>Angiosperm</strong> <strong>Phylogeny</strong> <strong>Group</strong> (<strong>APG</strong>) <strong>system</strong> The <strong>Angiosperm</strong> <strong>Phylogeny</strong> <strong>Group</strong>, or <strong>APG</strong>, refers to an informal international group of <strong>system</strong>atic botanists who came together to try to establish a consensus view of the taxonomy of flowering plants (angiosperms) that would reflect new knowledge about their relationships based upon phylogenetic studies. As of 2010, three incremental versions of a classification <strong>system</strong> have resulted from this collaboration (published in 1998, 2003 and 2009). An important motivation for the group was what they viewed as deficiencies in prior angiosperm classifications, which were not based on monophyletic groups (i.e. groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor). <strong>APG</strong> publications are increasingly influential, with a number of major herbaria changing the arrangement of their collections to match the latest <strong>APG</strong> <strong>system</strong>. <strong>Angiosperm</strong> classification and the <strong>APG</strong> Until detailed genetic evidence became available, the classification of flowering plants (also known as angiosperms, <strong>Angiosperm</strong>ae, Anthophyta or Magnoliophyta) was based on their morphology (particularly that of the flower) and their biochemistry (what kinds of chemical compound they contained or produced). Classification <strong>system</strong>s were typically produced by an individual botanist or by a small group. The result was a large number of such <strong>system</strong>s (see List of <strong>system</strong>s of plant taxonomy). Different <strong>system</strong>s and their updates tended to be favoured in different countries; e.g. the Engler <strong>system</strong> in continental Europe; the Bentham & Hooker <strong>system</strong> in Britain (particularly influential because it was used by Kew); the Takhtajan <strong>system</strong> in the former Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence; and the Cronquist <strong>system</strong> in the United States. History of classification The botanical term "<strong>Angiosperm</strong>", from the Ancient Greek αγγείον, angeíon (receptacle, vessel) and σπέρµα, (seed), was coined in the form <strong>Angiosperm</strong>ae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as the name of that one of his primary divisions of the plant kingdom. This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his Gymnospermae, or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Carolus Linnaeus with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its modern scope only became possible after 1827, when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae, and applied to them the name Gymnosperms. From that time onwards, so long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual, reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term <strong>Angiosperm</strong> was used antithetically by botanical writers, with varying scope, as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants. In 1851, Hofmeister discovered the changes occurring in the embryo-sac of flowering plants, and determined the correct relationships of these to the Cryptogamia. This fixed the position of Gymnosperms as a class distinct from Dicotyledons, and the term <strong>Angiosperm</strong> then gradually came to be accepted as the suitable designation for the whole of the flowering plants other than Gymnosperms, including the classes of Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons. This is the sense in which the term is used today. In most taxonomies, the flowering plants are treated as a coherent group. The most popular descriptive name has been <strong>Angiosperm</strong>ae (<strong>Angiosperm</strong>s), with Anthophyta ("flowering plants") a second choice. These names are not linked to any rank.
