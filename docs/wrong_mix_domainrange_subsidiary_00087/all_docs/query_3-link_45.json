Potential Sources of Existing Regionwide Indicator Data in the PPR\n\nThis report focuses on the basin-type wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), specifically, those wetlands which lack surface-water outlets during most years, are smaller than about 20 acres, and intermittently become dry. This report contains both information collected from an extensive literature review, and inferences made from that information. Information in the report was compiled to establish a common information source for all members of a panel charged with qualitatively assessing risks of loss of prairie pothole (PPH) wetlands. The process used in that risk assessment is described in the Summary report, and its application is documented in another report (Adamus 1992a). As explained in the Summary report, the risk assessment of which this literature review was a part has treated the entire PPR as a single entity. Yet clearly, considerable variability exists within the region. Thus, attempts to describe \"overall\" regional conditions have resulted in considerable simplification of actual relationships.\n\n2.0 Inventory and Status of PPH Wetlands\n\nThe U.S. portion of the PPR, which is the focus of this report, comprises 36% of the total PPR. Although the PPR contains only about 5% of the wetlands in the conterminous U.S., the density of wetlands in the PPR is greater than in most regions of the United States. Accurate, current figures on wetland acreage for the entire region or individual states are not available. The best potential source—the National Wetlands Inventory of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)—is not yet complete (see sections 4.3 and 6.0). A secondary source—the county soil surveys of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)—also does not contain complete regional coverage that would allow quantification of acreage of hydric soils. Estimates of statewide wetland acreage, and percent of land as wetland, have been made by the USFWS (1990a) as follows:\n\nTotal Land Acreage in PPR Statewide Total Wetland Acreage Wetland Acreage in PPR IA: 7,680,000 421,900 ( 1.2%) 35,000* MN: 13,440,000 8,700,000 (16.2%) 1,635,000* MT: 5,760,000 1,882,176 ( 2.0%)* no data ND: 24,960,000 2,490,000 ( 5.5%) 1,500,000* SD: 17,280,000 1,780,000 ( 3.6%) 1,546,000 * Data on wetland acreage located specifically in the PPR is from Iowa Dept. Natural Resources (1990), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (1990), and North Dakota Dept. Health and Consolidated Laboratories (1990b). PPR boundaries used by the states may differ from those used by this report, shown in Figure 1 of the summary report, thus affecting acreage estimates. The figure for total wetland acreage in Montana is from Montana Dept. Health and Environmental Sciences (1990).\n\nMost of these figures do not include cropped wetlands (those that were tilled at the time of the survey). In the PPR, the proportion of wetlands has seldom been compiled on a watershed basis. Data compiled by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers St. Paul District (1989) for watersheds of the Red River of the North (Minnesota and North Dakota) show that \"storage\" exceeded 10% of watershed area in 9 of 44 watersheds, the largest figures being 51% and 35% of watershed area. Other portions of the PPR would be expected to have a generally higher incidence of storage and wetlands. \"Storage\" in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1989) study was defined as the area of lakes, ponds, and swamps colored blue on standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps; the author reports much inconsistency in this among adjoining maps, and wetland acreage is surely underestimated. A sample of 17 North Dakota PPH basins had watershed:basin ratios ranging from 2.5 to 15.3 (Borthwick 1988).\n\nWetland depressions (hereinafter called \"basins,\" see Cowardin 1982) of the PPR have most often been classified according to the system of Stewart and Kantrud (1971). This classification will be used in this report, and includes the following classes:\n\nPermanent: The center of the wetland basin contains surface water during all years.\n\nSemipermanent: The center of the wetland basin contains surface water during most years.\n\nSeasonal: The center of the wetland basin contains surface water through mid-summer during most years of normal precipitation.\n\nTemporary: The center of the wetland basin contains surface water for less than about two weeks during most years of normal precipitation, although in some years, heavy summer precipitation can reflood these wetlands briefly.\n\n\"Saturated\" wetlands (e.g., bogs, fens) also occur to a very limited extent in the region, but along with streams and rivers. Although they may be of considerable importance in the PPR for support of biodiversity, they are mostly non-depressional and are not emphasized in this report.\n\nWetland basins vary greatly in their salinity and in their annual change. During an average year, perhaps 26% of the temporary, 51% of the seasonal, and 72% of the semipermanent basins contain surface water (Cowardin et al. 1988). Over an idealized wet-dry cycle, the vegetation in semipermanent wetlands goes through four stages: dry marsh, regenerating marsh, degenerating marsh, and lake marsh, with associated consequences for functions and values (Weller 1981).\n\nAlthough comprehensive data on the percentages of the basic basin types are lacking, some reasonable estimates have been made from statistical samples (e.g., Cowardin et al. 1988). For the PPR overall, temporary and seasonal basins are believed to be most numerous, whereas seasonal and semipermanent basins probably comprise the largest acreage (Stewart and Kantrud 1973). The generalized distribution of various types can be inferred from state-level geologic maps and topographic relief maps. Semipermanent basins tend to occur in areas of dead-ice and terminal (stagnation) moraines, and in areas of moderately to steeply rolling relief with few streams (Krapu and Duebbert 1989). Geographically, such areas occur largely in eastern South Dakota (in the Missouri-Prairie Coteau subregion) and along the western edge of the region in the Dakotas (Kantrud et al. 1989)(see Figure 1 in the summary report). Semipermanent basins also prevail in Iowa, because the greater intensity of agricultural activity there has resulted in tile-drainage of nearly all temporary and seasonal wetlands (pers. comm., A. van der Valk, Iowa St. Univ., Ames). Temporary and seasonal basins tend to occur in areas with ground moraines and lake plains, or are areas of gentle relief with scattered, poorly-developed channels (Krapu and Duebbert 1989). Geographically, such areas increase as a proportion of all basins in a westward direction. The annual variability in extent of surface water tends to increase in a southerly direction within the central and western parts of the PPR.\n\nSample-based estimates of wetland size distribution, by type, are available, but comprehensive data are lacking. In North Dakota, 92% of the basins in the PPR are reported to be <10 acres (Stewart and Kantrud 1973), and in South Dakota portions of the PPR, \"most\" of 2342 sampled wetlands were <1 acre in size (Cowardin et al. 1981). Semipermanent basins are typically the larger wetland basins. Large basins also occur in situations of collapsed glacial outwash (Bluemle 1977). Some of the widest, shallowest wetland basins occur in the lake plains subregions of north-central North Dakota and northeastern South Dakota. PPH basins within the PPR commonly occur at densities exceeding 20 per square mile and may exceed 100 per square mile in some undrained areas (Smith et al. 1964). Similar types of data are summarized by Hubbard and Linder (1986) and Hubbard (1988).\n\n3.0 Functions and Values\n\nThe following pages of the report discuss each potential* wetland function, along with its potentially* associated values, and potential* indicators of both the function and its values. This reflects the major components of wetland risk assessment, as discussed in section 1.3 of the Summary Report. Each function's discussion of indicators begins with a discussion of indicators appropriate at landscape and regional scales, and then addresses indicators that are best assessed and interpreted site-specifically.\n\n3.1 Maintenance of Runoff Volume\n\nDESCRIPTION: The volume of surface water runoff (i.e., landscape input) is diminished when water evaporates or is transferred to long-term or permanent storage in aquifers. Some PPH wetlands reduce runoff partly by efficiently evaporating (and transpiring) water, or in some cases transferring it to underground storage. The detention function of wetlands is discussed separately, in section 3.2.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: The role of PPH wetlands in regulating the volume of runoff, as opposed to its timing, is uncertain.\n\nOn one hand, some evidence suggests PPH wetlands dissipate water and thus reduce the volume of runoff. Relatively high rates of water loss from evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge have been documented during the mid-growing season, especially in basins smaller than about 5 acres (e.g., Allred et al. 1971, Millar 1971, Shjeflo 1968). Although evapotranspiration and deep recharge are slow processes, measurable in days, weeks, or even years (vs. runoff from storm events, which is measurable in hours), these processes can prime a landscape's soil absorptive capacity before storm events, so that runoff volume is reduced or prolonged following a storm. The long hydraulic detention times in PPH basins can result in large total losses of runoff to infiltration, recharge, and evapotranspiration, even though the rates of these processes are usually small relative to rates occurring in uplands.\n\nOn the other hand, other evidence suggests PPH wetlands conserve water and thus maintain the volume of runoff. Vegetation of PPH wetlands appears to reduce evaporation of open water at either end of the growing season, probably through reduction in wind velocity and shading (Eisenlohr 1966, Shjeflo 1968). If wetlands do, indeed, conserve a measurable amount of runoff in this manner, they might help maintain local water table levels. This might benefit crop production and wildlife production, because during the nongrowing season period, subsurface storage of water becomes a crucial determinant of crop yields the following growing season (Schroeder and Bauer 1984). \"Conserved soil moisture\" also is reported to be a better annual index of waterfowl numbers than are indices based on the extent of ponded water (Boyd 1981). Artificial drainage of wetlands can eliminate the ability of subsurface soil moisture to move upward in winter to replenish moisture in frozen soil above it (e.g., Malo 1975). In certain types of flat landscapes not characterized by recharge basins, this moisture might contribute measurably to sustaining crops and wildlife habitat the following growing season (Hubbard and Linder 1986). However, this increase in antecedent springtime soil moisture also could theoretically aggravate regional flooding. Regardless of whether PPH wetlands are dissipators or conservers of runoff volume, it still remains uncertain whether they dissipate or conserve enough volume of runoff (at least during the growing season) to cumulatively exert a detectable and socially important effect some distance downslope.\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: Changing the volume of runoff can potentially have implications for several values. If wetlands predominantly dissipate runoff, via evapotranspiration or deep recharge (i.e., recharge that is not readily released to surface waters downslope), then landowners with property in low areas surrounding each basin, as well as in downstream areas, could theoretically benefit from lower water levels during severe runoff events. On the other hand, this reduction in runoff could potentially be detrimental to a goal of maintaining adequate water supplies for livestock and crops during summer months. If, as discussed above, PPH wetlands have the opposite effect (i.e., they conserve water on the landscape), then the resultant increase in runoff volume could aggravate flood losses but could also help sustain crops, livestock, and wildlife.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: Losses of property as a result of flooding are of great concern in the PPR. There are over 200,000 households located within the 6209 square miles of 100-year floodplains in the PPR (FEMA data files). The largest concentration of floodable residences is in North Dakota, and flooding there damages up to $100 million per year worth of crops, roads, and property (ND Dept. Health and Consolidated Laboratories 1990b). In the Devils Lake area, Leitch and Scott (1984) assumed that for each acre of wetland restored, annual flood damages to transportation facilities would be reduced by $3.17, and flooding of crops would be reduced on 1.11 acres. Also, they estimated the benefits of making an acre of agricultural land flood-free would be $14.83. Including recreation values, total income generated by an undrained wetland for its flood control functions was estimated to be about $29/acre.\n\nIt is apparent that many PPR citizens (e.g., 79% in a survey by Grosz and Leitch 1990) value wetlands for their ability to reduce downstream flood losses. No studies have established a causal link between loss of runoff volume as a result of wetland evapotranspiration or recharge, and actual decreases in economic losses due to flooding.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Hydrologic inputs to PPR wetlands vary greatly among years. Throughout most of the PPR, landscape inputs (i.e., runoff volume) are greatest during early spring. Comparing two years (or locations) with equal amounts of total annual precipitation, the volume of spring runoff is likely to be much greater for the year (or location) in which, during the preceding autumn, a major rainstorm was followed by freezing, which then was followed by a snow cover that persisted through the winter. Conversely, less spring moisture is available during years (or locations) where winters are mild and lack continuous insulating snow cover. Springtime weather conditions also affect runoff. At years or locations where frozen soils persist late into the spring, wetland capacity for detaining runoff inputs and permitting their infiltration may be reduced (a point which, at least for clay hydric soils, is debatable; pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Any of the temporal effects just described can overwhelm the effects of spatial characteristics described in the following sections.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nRegional and landscape inputs to wetlands can be represented by indicators of runoff (such as watershed size, springtime rainfall, snow depth, and total annual precipitation) and indicators of groundwater discharge (such as subregion within the PPR and geology). Runoff inputs may be represented more accurately if the actual water yield to wetlands is used to represent landscape input. Water yield is precipitation, minus the evapotranspirative and other losses that occur in uplands before runoff from precipitation can reach wetlands. Evapotranspirative losses in uplands are measurably influenced in some situations (e.g., Deibert et al. 1986, Sophocleous and McAllister 1987) but not all (e.g., Khakural 1988) by crop type and tillage practices, as well as by grazing regimes (e.g., Hofmann et al. 1983).\n\nRunoff inputs to wetlands are also affected by geomorphic characteristics of the watershed area upslope of the wetlands. Runoff entering wetlands is likely to be greater, and storm hydrographs sharper, where upslope watersheds are elongate in shape, relatively steep, comprised of clayey or similar less-permeable soils, and are channelized or artificially drained. Conversely, as a watershed becomes more rounded in shape and dominated by generally flat permeable soils that are not artificially drained, runoff inputs to downslope wetlands diminish, having the same effect as a decrease in watershed area. However, if wetlands are mainly of a type whose water budget is dominated by groundwater (e.g., semipermanent basins), then conversion of upland grasslands to tillage can cause water tables to drop and wetlands to dry up (pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo).\n\nIn the PPR, available data suggest that the potential hydrologic input to wetlands (i.e., precipitation surplus plus groundwater) is greatest in the southern and eastern part of the region. The actual input, as noted above, depends on factors such as crop type, soil type, slope, soil permeability, watershed shape, and extent of upstream channelization/drainage. Within the PPR, soil permeability (as predicted by soil type) probably shows few geographic patterns, as the ratio of till to outwash is about the same in Iowa as in North Dakota (pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Also, the form of precipitation (snow vs. rain) measurably affects the degree to which it is stored or evaporated by the landscape. Citing evidence from a study in northern Ontario, Winter and Woo (1990) state that wetlands delay streamflow response to rainfall but not to snowmelt; it is not apparent that this is the case in the PPR (pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). In the northwestern part of the PPR, over 25% of the annual precipitation occurs as snow, whereas less than 12% occurs as snow in southeastern South Dakota (Winter and Woo 1990).\n\nCapacity for losing water via evaporation in wetlands depends partly on landscape factors. As is apparent in the conceptual model presented in a related report (Adamus 1992b), the effects of wind velocity and air temperature—which measurably influence evapotranspiration—can be indicated by landscape/regional characteristics such as latitude, longitude, elevation, and general topographic relief. Regional geologic patterns can also determine characteristics that operate within wetlands and are conducive to evaporative loss of runoff, as described in (B) below. The relative extent of runoff lost to recharge can also be estimated from geologic and topographic patterns; in watersheds having a large proportion of wetland basins located near regional drainage divides, these basins are often groundwater recharge areas (Sloan 1972). Similarly, the contagion characteristics of the wetland spatial distribution (e.g., distribution of acreage in wetlands is dispersed vs. clumped) are likely to affect potential for evaporative loss. As expressed by Hubbard (1988):\n\nComplexes should provide for better groundwater recharge and better water retention than similar acreages of wetlands in a large, single basin...small [temporary, seasonal] wetlands will regenerate their storage capacity and be ready to store the next runoff event much more quickly than large wetlands.\n\nIn addition, climatic patterns influence and indicate relative losses from evapotranspiration. Subregions within the PPR having a larger portion of their hydrologic inputs occurring during summertime (vs. spring) may lose considerable water via transpiration, assuming water tables do not drop below the root zone for extended periods. Wetlands located in subregions with a relatively greater portion of runoff occurring in summertime probably are more capable of reducing runoff volume. However, the differences among PPH wetlands in their capacity to reduce runoff volume may be attributable more to differences in recharge capacity than to differences in evapotranspiration (Sloan 1972). Indicators of recharge are discussed in section 3.3 (page B-15).\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nWetlands of all types may reduce runoff volume, but the magnitude of this function is partly indicated by wetland water regime (i.e., as used in this report, meaning the basin hydroperiod or permanence type—temporary, seasonal, semipermanent, or permanent). Water regime in turn can be indicated generally by plant species, soil profile, landscape geology, relief, and geographic position. Drier basins, such as temporary and seasonal types, are often densely vegetated. Until the water table drops below the root zone in early summer, the vegetation in these wetlands can efficiently reduce runoff volume by evapotranspirating water and directing some runoff into underlying groundwater storage (i.e., recharge). However, wetland basins that are relatively deep (e.g., semipermanent) tend to lose a smaller portion of their water to evaporation, because a smaller portion of the water volume is directly exposed to wind and sunlight. Moreover, the peripheral vegetation of semipermanent basins, although it transpires water throughout the growing season, shields much of the water surface from wind and sun and thus reduces losses due to evaporation (Eisenlohr 1966, Shjeflo 1968).\n\nAnother site-specific indicator of wetland capacity for reducing runoff volume is basin size and shape. Wetland basins that are small, with convoluted and/or gently sloping shorelines, are likely to have a larger proportion of their area as shallows, i.e., smaller depth-to-volume ratio (Millar 1971). Such conditions lead to warmer water temperatures and a larger percent cover of vegetation, which in turn can lead to greater rates of water loss via summertime evapotranspiration (Crow and Ree 1964), at least in temporary and seasonal basins. Small, convoluted basins may be optimal for loss of surface water via recharge.\n\nA third site-specific indicator is the ratio of emergent or woody vegetation to open water. Because during the growing season an equal or greater volume of runoff can be lost via vegetative transpiration than by unvegetated open water, densely vegetated wetlands, if temporary or seasonal, may have a greater capacity for reducing runoff volume. However, during months when vegetation is dormant, evaporative water losses may be less where conditions allow a continuous ground cover or dense litter layer to protect wet sediments from exposure to wind and sun (e.g., Rickerl and Smolik 1990).\n\nFourth, the vegetation type probably influences evapotranspirative losses. Wetland basins dominated by submersed, shallow-rooted, or fine-leaved plants (as indicated partly by the successional status of the basin) generally experience less evapotranspirative loss of water than those dominated by broad-leaved, deep-rooted species.\n\nFinally, water chemistry both influences and indicates potential for reduction in runoff volume. Loss of water can be less in permanently saline basins than in freshwater basins, due to reduced evaporation (e.g., Whiting 1984), and reduced transpiration due to impedance of osmotic tension in plants. Moreover, saline wetlands typically represent groundwater discharge situations, whereas loss of runoff volume is enhanced in situations of groundwater recharge. In the PPR, saline basins mostly occur in topographically low positions on glacial outwash in western and northern areas.\n\nEach of the above five site-specific indicators can be manifested on a regional level as well. That is, because these indicators correlate roughly with regional geologic and climate patterns, in a general sense they may show spatial trends within a region.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES:\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Value\n\nEconomic value of the runoff volume reduction function can be indicated partly by number of floodplain properties, the market value of these properties, and their position and proximity relative to those wetland complexes that cumulatively have the greatest capacity for reducing runoff volume. Also, the season of flooding may partly determine the value of runoff control. Spring floods can delay planting, summer floods tending to damage maturing crops as well as dwellings, and autumn floods can delay harvest. Ecological values of maintaining runoff volume also depend on the season of flooding and the position and proximity of wetlands to areas of greatest intrinsic ecological importance.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Value\n\nLocal economic values of this function for water supply are indicated partly by the density of livestock, the extent of cropped wetlands, and the drought vulnerability of the most widely grown crops. The value of wet areas to livestock and crops increases in proportion to the severity of drought occurring during a particular year.\n\n3.2 Maintenance of Runoff Timing\n\nDESCRIPTION: Surface water runoff (i.e., landscape input) is delayed in its down gradient journey when water is detained (i.e., increased functional capacity) in wetland basins. PPH wetlands facilitate detention of runoff because they mostly lack well-defined surface water outlets, and interbasin subsurface flows are very slow (e.g., 0.05 meters/day, Tipton et al. 1972). When runoff is detained in a regionally dispersed manner by PPH basins, pulses of water that eventually enter downstream areas in most cases are staggered (desynchronized). This broadens the storm hydrograph and reduces streamflow peaks.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: Prairie pothole wetlands can reduce peak flows occurring in channels downslope, because they have considerable capacity for detaining runoff (e.g., Hubbard and Linder 1986, Ludden et al. 1983). Detention of precipitation occurs largely because most PPH basins lack surface water outlets, and also because robust vegetation that occurs in some wetlands is capable of effectively intercepting and storing drifting snow (Sloan 1972), allowing water to infiltrate in depressions rather than moving downslope during melt periods.\n\nSeveral empirical landscape studies and landscape simulation studies in the PPR have attempted to demonstrate diminuation of downstream peak flows as a result of the presence of many wetlands, or aggravation of peak flows due to artificial drainage of wetlands (Brun et al. 1981, Moore and Larson 1979, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers St. Paul District 1989). These studies have not differentiated whether any peak flow diminuation is due to volume reductions, as just discussed in section 3.1, or to runoff timing alterations (i.e., desynchronization) associated with wetlands, as discussed below. Artificial drainage of wetlands was implicated by Sidle (1983) in the increase of economically damaging floods of the James River in North Dakota. In flat landscapes of Florida, watersheds where most of the wetlands have been drained or channelized have detention times of only 2.2 days, vs. 4.5 days for undrained, unchannelized watersheds (Bedient et al. 1976). However, as discussed in section 4.2, wetland drainage does not inevitably cause increased flood stages downstream. In some cases, alteration of main-channel wetlands may do more than artificial drainage of isolated wetlands to aggravate flooding (Moore and Larson 1979, Ogawa and Male 1983), and in some instances artificial drainage could theoretically ameliorate peak flows by decreasing antecedent moisture conditions prior to storm events (Hill 1976).\n\nNonetheless, PPH basins have considerable potential for storing runoff. In the large wetland complexes of Salyer National Wildlife Refuge of North Dakota, undrained, mostly unconnected wetlands were reported to be storing 58% of the inflow, plus all local runoff (Malcolm 1979). In the Devils Lake Basin of North Dakota, wetland basins store between 41% of the runoff from severe (100-year) storm events, and up to 72% of the runoff from smaller events (Ludden et al. 1983). In the Pembina River Basin of North Dakota, each undrained wetland can store up to one acre-foot of runoff (Kloet 1971), a figure also supported by the data of Hubbard and Linder (1986) from 213 wetlands in northeastern South Dakota. Moreover, that study noted that most wetlands were not filled to capacity at the time of measurement.\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: At a landscape level, detaining runoff in wetland basins has implications for several values. By flattening the storm hydrograph, some wetlands help reduce flooding in downslope areas. This can potentially reduce economic damage to property, as quantified in section 3.1. The effects on ecological resources of releasing runoff more gradually can be either adverse (e.g., reduced frequency of scouring flows needed to maintain habitat of some species) or positive (e.g., increased annual minimum flows, improved purification of runoff due to lengthened processing time).\n\nOn a site-specific level, by detaining water later into the growing season, wetlands can provide water for livestock, soil moisture for surrounding croplands, and habitat for aquatic wildlife, particularly in areas of glacial till (Hubbard 1988). However, this renders some temporary wetlands unsuitable for cultivation.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: On a landscape level, damages to property as a result of flooding are of great concern in the PPR. On a local level, water supplies for livestock and crops are also a great concern, particularly in the western part of the region. Maintaining soil moisture in that area is a major public concern. It is apparent that many PPR citizens (e.g., 79% in survey by Grosz and Leitch 1990) think that wetlands are important for their ability to reduce downstream flood losses. Although some regional studies have supported a link between wetlands and peak flow reduction, no studies have established causal links between shortened detention times, increased flow synchronization, increased peak flows, and actual economic losses due to flooding.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Hydrologic inputs to PPR wetlands vary greatly among years. Throughout most of the PPR, landscape inputs (i.e., runoff volume) are greatest during early spring. Comparing two years (or locations) with equal amounts of total annual precipitation, the volume of spring runoff is likely to be much greater for the year (or location) in which, during the preceding autumn, a major rainstorm was followed by freezing, which then was followed by a snow cover that persisted through the winter. Conversely, less spring moisture is available during years (or locations) where winters are mild and lack continuous insulating snow cover. Springtime weather conditions also affect runoff. At years or locations where frozen soils persist late into the spring, wetland capacity for detaining runoff inputs and permitting their infiltration may be reduced (a point which, at least for clay hydric soils, is debatable; pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Any of the temporal effects just described can overwhelm the effects of spatial characteristics described in the following sections.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nLandscape inputs to wetlands can be represented by indicators of precipitation and water yield or their surrogates (e.g., watershed shape, soil type, slope, and channelization extent) as described on page B-7. Also, differences in rainfall or snowmelt intensity exist within the PPR; subregions with shorter, more intense rainfall or snowmelt may yield proportionally more runoff to wetlands.\n\nCapacity for detaining runoff in wetlands can be indicated by within-wetland factors, but the important consequences of detention—i.e., whether detention will result in synchronization or desynchronization of downstream flows—depend on between-wetland landscape factors, specifically, the spatial arrangement of wetlands relative to receiving channels, and the diversity of their sizes (storage volumes). Science has not advanced to the point where it is possible to specify all combinations of wetland spatial position, size, and type that are optimal for desynchronizing flows.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nReview of the conceptual model suggests several site-specific indicators that determine or correlate with hydrologic detention. Perhaps the most important indicator of the ability of a wetland to detain flow is the frequency and magnitude of connection to other basins. This is indicated partly by the height of the rim separating basins in a complex, as well as the subsurface flow patterns and the extent of artificial drainage connections. Basins that remain hydrologically isolated, regardless of the size of the runoff event, are essentially \"noncontributing areas.\" These basins can have the largest influence on runoff timing because all runoff that reaches them is retained. The ratio of basin size to watershed (catchment) size is also important. Provided their water budgets are not dominated by groundwater discharge, basins that are large relative to the watershed (catchment) area are likely to be effective in detaining runoff. A third indicator of the magnitude of runoff detention in wetland basins is wetland water regime. Water regime can be indicated generally by plant species, soil profile, landscape geology, relief, and geographic position. Drier wetland basins, such as temporary and seasonal types, probably have a larger proportion of their basin available for storage and infiltration of spring runoff. Infiltration occurs because (a) the topographic position of most temporary and seasonal basins enhances their ability to recharge groundwater, (b) thawing of sediments occurs earlier in the season than in semipermanent and permanent basins, thus making interpore space available in wetland soils for water storage, and (c) when frozen, the clayey soils that typify many of these basins contain macropores which facilitate loss of runoff to ground water recharge. In contrast, semipermanent and permanent basins are often dominated by the more sustained inflows from groundwater discharge, leaving little space available for subsurface storage of runoff. Wetland soil type may also partially indicate wetland capacity to desynchronize inputs. Hydric soils which during years of snow cover do not freeze deeply, or which thaw earlier in the spring (e.g., blackish mineral soils), allow runoff to infiltrate during the weeks when most runoff occurs. Finally, wetland capacity for detaining runoff is suggested by wetland size and shape. As noted earlier, smaller wetlands and wetland basins with convoluted shorelines are likely to have more gently sloping shorelines and a larger proportion of their area as shallows. Such zones are more likely than deepwater to support recharge and infiltration, which in turn makes space available for storing runoff.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES:\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Value:\n\nEconomic value of the hydrologic detention function can be indicated partly by the season of flooding (summer floods tending to damage crops as well as dwellings), number of floodplain properties, the market value of these properties, and their position and proximity relative to wetlands that cumulatively have the greatest capacity for reducing runoff volume. Ecological values of maintaining runoff timing also depend on the season of flooding and the position and proximity of wetlands to areas of greatest intrinsic ecological importance.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Value:\n\nThe values of this function are expressed primarily at the landscape scale. See the discussion above.\n\n3.3 Groundwater Recharge\n\nDESCRIPTION: Surface water runoff (i.e., landscape input), when delayed in storage areas during its downgradient journey, can move downward into underlying aquifers, recharging the groundwater.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: Recharge has been documented in several PPH basins, particularly those with temporary or seasonal water regimes in the western portion of the PPR (Sloan 1972, Eisenlohr et al. 1972). Infiltration rates of up to 0.5 foot per day have been reported (Sloan 1972). In a Minnesota part of the PPR, wetlands recharge aquifers probably by applying a relatively constant hydraulic head that forces water into underlying unweathered till, Wall et al. (1989). It is not apparent that the presence of wetland vegetation or soils enhances recharge; rather, such wetland basins just happen to occur in topographic situations that are intrinsically supportive of recharge.\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: Primarily at a landscape level, recharge from wetlands can play a role in sustaining groundwater used domestically and for pastured livestock. Because loss of recharge functions can result in greater well-drilling and pumping costs, and possibly greater agricultural expenses, loss of wetlands might aggravate such expenses, if indeed the role of wetlands is large relative to that of other landscape components that contribute to groundwater (e.g., Hubbard and Linder 1986). Recharge from wetlands also sustains groundwater that discharges to other wetlands (e.g., semipermanent and permanent basins), thus potentially supporting their ecological, water purification, and economic values (Lissey 1971; Richardson and Arndt 1989). Seasonally fluctuating water levels in wetlands, as controlled largely by natural rates of recharge, are important to maintaining wetland productivity. On the other hand, loss of recharge wetlands can cause remaining wetlands and ditches to become groundwater discharge areas which increase the salinity of soils, rendering them unsuitable for cultivation (Arndt and Richardson 1986, Hendry and Buckland 1990).\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: Groundwater is a major source of consumed water in the PPR, contributing from 39% (in North Dakota) to 83% (in Iowa) of the water used in 1980. Use specifically for domestic human consumption varies from 34% (in Iowa and Montana) to 52% statewide in Minnesota. Use for livestock and irrigation varies from 30% in Iowa and Minnesota to 86% in Montana (Moody et al. 1986). The U.S. Geological Survey considers future groundwater development in North Dakota to be limited partly by \"insufficient aquifer recharge\" (Paulson 1983). Where PPH basins recharge groundwater, it helps ensure adequate water supplies for livestock and crops. This is a particularly great concern in the western part of the region.\n\nHowever, the role of wetlands specifically, as opposed to other landscape elements, in supporting these values is debated. The geographic extent to which recharge via PPH wetlands enters groundwater tapped by wells, as opposed to recharging zones higher or lower than those used domestically, is unknown. Although some PPH basins are known to recharge groundwater, there appear to be no data that link recharge rates specifically from wetlands to actual use rates and economic values of the users. However, if indeed recharge in the western and flatter parts of the PPR occurs only rarely in uplands (Freeze and Banner 1970, Lissey 1971, Malo 1975), the value of wetlands in that subregion can be assumed directly.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Hydrologic inputs to PPR wetlands vary greatly among years. Throughout most of the PPR, landscape inputs (i.e., runoff volume) are greatest during early spring. Comparing two years (or locations) with equal amounts of total annual precipitation, the volume of runoff available for springtime recharge of groundwater is likely to be much greater for the year (or location) in which, during the preceding autumn, a major rainstorm was followed by freezing, which then was followed by a snow cover that persisted through the winter. Conversely, less spring moisture is available during years (or locations) where winters are mild and lack continuous insulating snow cover. Springtime weather conditions also affect water available for recharge. At years or locations where frozen soils persist late into the spring, wetland capacity for detaining runoff and permitting its infiltration as recharge may be reduced (a point which, at least for clay hydric soils, is debatable; pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Any of the temporal effects just described can overwhelm the effects of spatial characteristics described in the following sections.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nRegional and landscape inputs to wetlands that support groundwater recharge can be represented by indicators of precipitation and water yield, including watershed shape, slope, crop type, soil type, and artificial drainage, as described on page B-7.\n\nCapacity for recharging groundwater is indicated primarily by regional and landscape factors. In particular, climate, as represented by regional position within the PPR, is a primary indicator of recharge. Undrained basins in the western and northern parts of the PPR (including the Lake Agassiz plain) contain predominantly recharge wetlands, whereas basins in Iowa, southern Minnesota, and parts of eastern South Dakota mostly contain discharge or flow-through wetlands (pers. comm., J.L. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo).\n\nTopographic position is another landscape indicator of recharge. At least in the eastern portion of the PPR, wetland complexes located near major regional divides often recharge groundwater (Swanson et al. 1988). Thus, when local terrain is homogeneously flat or slopes sharply away from a wetland (i.e., great local relief and large regional slope, cf. Winter 1977), the water table often slopes away as well, resulting in a hydraulic gradient favorable for movement of water into the groundwater system. In contrast, wetlands located at the bottom of a relatively steep slope are often areas of groundwater discharge, because the water table crops out at the surface near the deflection point of the slope.\n\nAlso, the contagion characteristics of the wetland spatial distribution (e.g., distribution of acreage in wetlands is dispersed vs. clumped) are likely to affect potential for recharge. Wetland acreage occurring as complexes rather than as single large wetlands should provide for better groundwater recharge (Hubbard 1988) because such landscape are more likely to indicate diversified potentiometric gradients, which are more conducive to recharge.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nWetland water regime is a prominent indicator of groundwater recharge. Water regime can be indicated generally by plant species, soil profile, landscape geology, relief, and geographic position. Drier wetland basins, such as temporary and some seasonal basins, have been documented as being recharge areas in much of the northwestern PPR (Lissey 1971, Loken 1991), particularly where they occur as part of a wetland complex. In contrast, the larger semipermanent and permanent basins are often dominated by groundwater discharge or are flow-through systems. However, in the western PPR (Richardson et al. 1991) or in landscapes with water tables recently lowered by extensive artificial drainage, semipermanent basins probably assume increased importance for recharging groundwater. Another site-specific indicator (but not determinant) of the ability of a wetland to recharge groundwater is the ratio of wetland size to watershed size. Large basins that have very small watersheds, or whose watersheds contain many other basins, are likely to be groundwater discharge areas. Conversely, small basins (at least in the western PPR) tend to be groundwater recharge areas (Loken 1991).\n\nWater and soil chemistry can indicate, but not determine, the direction of groundwater exchange where the magnitude of exchange is great. Basins that have higher specific conductivity, pH, alkalinity, hardness, magnesium, sulfates, and total dissolved solids; and lower concentrations of calcium and total bicarbonates, are likely to be dominated by groundwater discharge, not recharge (Sloan 1972, Arndt and Richardson 1986). In the PPR, such basins occur mostly in western and northern areas. In soil profiles, recharge is suggested by presence of only small quantities of gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H2O) and absence of calcite (CaCO3). Recharge basin soils are generally nonsaline, noncalcareous, with deep sola (depth of soil development). Also, they usually have well-developed eluvial (highly leached) and argillic (clay enriched) horizons (Miller et al. 1985, Hubbard 1988). They would generally be classified as Argiaquols.\n\nThe texture of soil and subsurface materials is often a major determinant of groundwater exchange, although not of recharge or discharge specifically. In theory, groundwater should move most rapidly through coarse sands or gravels and successively slower through fibric peats, deep sapric peats, and clays. In some cases, this ranking is easily overridden by topographic factors and the presence of rooted wetland plants. Macropores created by plants enhance infiltration into underlying aquifers through shallow clay layers or compacted bottom sediments (Eisenlohr 1966). On the other hand, the surface layer of organic matter formed by these plants progressively accumulates (unless removed by waves, currents, wind, animals, fire, sulfate reduction, or decomposition). In doing so, it might progressively isolate or seal a wetland from groundwater systems.\n\nThe above site-specific indicators can be manifested on a regional level as well, because they are partly a reflection of regional geologic patterns.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES: Economic values of this function are partly indicated by the density of livestock or humans dependent on wells, the depth of wells relative to wetland inputs to the groundwater, and the drought vulnerability of the subregion. Ecological values of recharging groundwater also depend on the local drought vulnerability and the proximity of recharging wetlands to areas of greatest intrinsic ecological importance.\n\n3.4 Sediment Retention\n\nDESCRIPTION: Sediment retention is the process by which sediment borne by overland runoff (e.g., sheet flow) and incoming surface waters is deposited (sedimentation) and retained (stabilization). PPH wetlands retain sediments by (a) trapping them in basins closed to surface outflow, (b) anchoring sediments with plant roots, and (c) intercepting and reducing erosional energies (e.g., wind, waves). To be stabilized over long periods of time, sediment entering wetlands must either be deposited in deep permanent waters, or be stabilized by encrusting precipitates or roots of wetland vegetation. High winds typical of the region can remove a small portion of the sediment from large (especially saline) basins during drought periods.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: PPH wetlands retain virtually all sediment which enters them because they lack surface water outlets. Sediment retention, perhaps because it seems so obviously present in PPH basins, has seldom been documented in the PPR. One study of a series of South Dakota potholes reported accretion rates of between 430 and 800 g/m2/year (Martin and Hartman 1987a). An open lake system in South Dakota removed 43, 33, and 100% of the suspended solids from tributary input during three successive years (SDRCWP 1990), and two open wetland complexes in North Dakota removed 13 and 28% of the tributary suspended sediment, vs. a 2000% increase in sediment exported from a ditch-drained wetland complex (Malcolm 1979). Sedimentation rates might also be inferred from data collected by Callender 1969, Frickel 1972, Churchill et al. 1975, and Okland 1978.\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: Excess sediment deposition impairs fish production, biodiversity, and flood storage and conveyance. For example, little of the sediment entering the James River in South Dakota is transported downriver (Benson 1988). At a landscape level, wetlands are among the most effective landscape features for mitigating sedimentation problems. They do so by intercepting and retaining eroded sediment before it reaches larger, more permanent waterbodies. Thus, protection and enhancement of this function in wetlands could help maintain and restore public uses of downslope lakes and rivers, such as fish production, biodiversity, and flood conveyance. However, on a site-specific level, retaining sediments in PPH wetlands can adversely impact the ecological and hydrologic values of the wetlands themselves. Thus, the potential landscape-level values of some wetlands to effectively treat nonpoint nutrient runoff must be balanced against the likelihood that site-specific (and eventually, landscape) ecological values may compromised.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: All of the states of the PPR, in their annual 305b water quality report, declare sedimentation the most important threat to public uses of surface waters. In South Dakota, 26% of the assessed river miles statewide have water quality that is so degraded it does not support any of their designated uses, and 44% show partial support; about 12% are not fishable due to water quality problems. Some 20% of the lakes do not meet their designated uses (SD Dept. Water and Natural Resources 1990). In North Dakota, 25% of the assessed river miles, and 36% of the lake acres, have water quality that is so degraded it does not fully support all of their designated uses (ND Dept. Health and Consolidated Laboratories 1990b).\n\nAlso, public opinion surveys indicate that many PPR citizens (e.g., 90% in survey by Grosz and Leitch 1990) think that wetlands are important for their ability to purify water. Despite reductions of erosion in some counties as a result of implementing the federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), sedimentation problems may be increasing, as a trend of converting grasslands (range, hay, pasture) to row crops continues (Kantrud et al. 1989). Although PPH basins are known to retain sediment, no attempts have been made to link quantitative estimates of sedimentation rates specifically from wetlands to actual use rates and economic values of the users of downslope water that is benefitted.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Throughout most of the PPR, runoff inputs to wetland basins are greatest during early spring. Often, this early spring runoff bears the largest portion of sediment entering wetlands. Much of the sediment originates from lands tilled the previous autumn. Comparing two years (or locations) with equal amounts of total annual precipitation, the transport of sediment is likely to be much greater for the year (or location) in which, during the preceding autumn, a major rainstorm was followed by freezing, which then was followed by a snow cover that persisted through the winter and was followed by a warm early spring. Under such conditions, the large spring thaw is likely to mobilize considerable sediment. Conversely, springtime sediment runoff may be less during years (or locations) where winters are mild and lack continuous insulating snow cover. In other instances, springtime conditions affect sediment inputs to a greater degree than conditions during the preceding autumn or winter. Although PPH basins retain nearly all sediment that reaches them, their cumulative removal efficiency may be greatest during years when the runoff occurs later in the season, or during years when summer (vs. early spring) storms contribute a larger portion of the annual sediment input to wetlands. That is because as the season progresses, wetland soils thaw and vegetation develops more fully, thus increasing trapping efficiency. Any of the temporal effects just described can overwhelm the effects of spatial characteristics described in the following sections.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nRegional and landscape inputs of sediment to wetlands can be represented by indicators of the amount, intensity (Young and Wiersma 1973), and timing of precipitation and water yield, as described on page B-7. Other factors indicate potential sediment inputs to wetlands resulting both from erosion of upland areas, and from the lack of interception of runoff-borne sediment before it reaches wetlands. These include proximity to wetlands of land covers, soil types, and slope conditions that are considered highly erodible or poorly interceptive (i.e., weak buffers). In watersheds with erosion-resistant soils, wetlands surrounded by wide buffer strips of dense vegetation usually receive the least inputs of sediment, unless tile(vs. ditch) drainage is prevalent. Also, the type of grazing regime (Hofmann et al. 1983) and crop management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, contour plowing) determine both the magnitude of sediment runoff (Young and Wiersma 1973) and lack of interception before reaching wetlands. The Soil Conservation Service office in each county of the PPR has integrated erosion factors to identify and list soil mapping units considered to be Highly Erodible Land (HEL). Where these HEL units are based on vulnerability to non-wind related erosion (as predicted mainly by slope), these data can be used to assess relative sedimentation risks of various wetland complexes and other water bodies. Artificial drainage of individual wetlands normally causes initially large exports of sediment to downslope areas. In localized situations, drainage might occasionally reduce long-term sediment export to downslope areas, in two ways. First, at least in watersheds where drainage is accomplished by use of tile rather than ditches, artificial drainage can cause a large portion of the precipitation to infiltrate rather than move downslope as overland runoff and carry soil with it. Second, wetland drainage could theoretically reduce landscape-level sediment inputs if drainage results in farm operators planting crops in drained lands rather than in highly erodible uplands, which under the CRP are frequently returned to a permanent cover such as hay (Danielson and Leitch 1986).\n\nCapacity for retaining sediment is related, on a landscape scale, to the spatial arrangement of wetland complexes relative to inputting land uses. Science has not advanced to the point where it is possible to specify all combinations of wetland spatial position, size, and type that are optimal for retaining sediment at a landscape scale. Nonetheless, the contagion characteristics of the wetland spatial distribution (e.g., proportion of subregional wetland acreage that is dispersed vs. clumped) are likely to affect both the potential extent of sediment input to wetlands and wetland capacity to retain it. Wetland acreage occurring as scattered complexes rather than as single large wetlands should be more likely to be located near and downslope from sediment sources, partly because complexes tend to occur in hummocky terrain. Although in hummocky terrain the predominant land cover (rangeland) is usually less supportive of erosion than is cropland, where soil tillage does occur, erosion may be great. Moreover, the larger shoreline-to-area (or smaller depth-to-volume) ratio associated with a more dispersed wetland acreage implies that a larger portion of sediment-bearing runoff will enter wetlands via shoreline zones of dense vegetation. Although such vegetation has minimal effect on long-term sedimentation of a basin, it may reduce the amount of sediment in suspension and thus benefit some other wetland functions (e.g.) Dieter 1990).\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nMost of the site-specific indicators described for the function, Maintenance of Runoff Timing (section 3.2), are suitable as indicators of sediment retention, because retention is closely linked to hydraulic retention or settling time. Again, the frequency and magnitude of connection to other basins and the ratio of wetland size to watershed size are important indicators of sediment retention capacity. Also, wetland water regime influences sediment retention. Water regime can be indicated generally by plant species, soil profile, landscape geology, relief, and geographic position. The drier wetland basins, such as temporary and seasonal types, probably have a larger proportion of their basin available for storage and infiltration of spring runoff, with concommitant deposition of suspended sediment. However, large temporary and seasonal basins that are saline, burned, or otherwise sparsely vegetated may become minor sources rather than sinks for sediments during windy or overflow conditions, whereas sediments deposited in semipermanent and permanent basins are usually protected from wind erosion by overlying waters.\n\nWhere concern focuses on turbidity within the open water portions of an individual wetland or lake basin, other indicators are appropriate. Turbidity may be caused by either inorganic (e.g., clay) or organic (e.g., plankton) in the open water area. Turbidity problems are likely to be aggravated if the basin is tilled or re-ditched during seasonal dryout periods or drought years; has steep banks of erodible soil; is excessively enriched; contains animals that disturb shallow bottom sediments (e.g., carp, livestock, humans in boats); has recently lost protective shoreline vegetation as a result of overgrazing, burning, or salination; or is shallow and exposed to strong winds (Carper and Bachmann 1984). On the other hand, indicators of diminished problems with open water turbidity include dense vegetative cover (both submerged aquatics and emergents) close to the path of incoming sediment during the season of greatest sediment runoff (e.g., Dieter 1990); high densities of filter-feeding zooplankton; and high salinity or specific conductance (approximately greater than 500 mS/cm, Akhurst and Breen 1988). Specific conductance is generally greater in basins in glacial outwash areas than in glacial till (Swanson et al. 1988). Conductance fluctuates greatly from year to year within PPH wetland basins; in-basin sediment deposition rates might be expected to fluctuate accordingly.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES: The values of retaining sediment in wetlands can be indicated by the ecological, commercial, and recreational importance of the receiving waters relative to those of the retaining wetlands (Ribaudo 1986), and the vulnerability as of receiving waters as judged by factors described above under the discussion of indicators of inputs. All of the PPR states, in their 305b water quality reports, have listed water bodies impacted by nonpoint sediment runoff.\n\n3.5 Phosphorus Retention\n\nDESCRIPTION: Phosphorus retention is the process by which phosphorus borne by overland runoff (e.g., sheet flow), incoming surface waters, and perhaps groundwater and precipitation, is held for long periods within the sediments, water column, or biota of a wetland basin. While phosphorus is being retained within a basin, it can be converted from one form to another, e.g., from organic to inorganic form, or from oxidized to reduced form.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: On a landscape level, PPH wetlands would seem to retain virtually all phosphorus which enters them. This is because most phosphorus is retained by adsorption to surface sediments within wetland basins, or by seasonal incorporation into plant material. In the PPR generally, phosphorus is unlikely to migrate downward into groundwater systems, partly because of adsorptive calcareous soils and alkaline pH values (Hubbard 1988). However, in the eastern PPR, groundwater originating from recharge sites mainly in upland cultivated areas with non-sulfatic soils may contain elevated concentrations of phosphorus (e.g., SDRCWP 1990, Wall et al. 1989). Isolated PPH wetlands become sources rather than sinks for phosphorus only when (a) biological materials from within a basin are dispersed outside the basin by mobile vertebrates, emerging insects, or severe runoff events that connect basins, or (b) phosphorus-bearing sediments and plants are blown from large saline basins during seasonal dryout or drought years.\n\nOn a site-specific level (i.e., within wetland basins) phosphorus may be repeatedly reduced and oxidized as influenced by seasonal and annual wetland water levels. The highly productive and diverse biological communities may also cycle the phosphorus rapidly between particulate and dissolved form; between sediments, biota, and water column; and between open water and marsh zones. During severe winters when basins freeze completely to their bottoms, phosphorus in the water column may be forced into the sediments (pers. comm., J. Kadlec, Utah State Univ., Logan). Phosphorus retention has been studied in few PPH basins. An open lake system in South Dakota removed 70, 80, and 100% of the tributary phosphorus input during three successive years (SDRCWP 1990). Two open wetland complexes in North Dakota removed 52 and 85% of the tributary phosphorus, vs. a 200-to-600% increase from two drained wetland complexes (Malcolm 1979).\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: Excess phosphorus causes blooms of algae which potentially impair drinking water quality, biodiversity, and opportunities for swimming and fishing. Fishing is popular throughout the region, yet fish populations in many rivers and lakes are subject to die-offs as a result of oxygen depletions caused by excessive algal growth, which in turn had been stimulated by abnormal enrichment by phosphorus-laden runoff. If wetlands play a measurable role in retaining phosphorus, and if phosphorus is a primary factor limiting the algae which diminish ecological and recreational values of waters used or valued by the public, then wetland loss could further diminish these values and increase the cost to taxpayers of waste treatment plant construction.\n\nOn a landscape level, much of the phosphorus in runoff is associated with suspended sediment. Because wetlands (as discussed above) are among the most effective landscape features for mitigating sedimentation problems, they may also intercept much of the associated phosphorus before it reaches larger, more permanent waterbodies. Thus, protection and enhancement of this function in wetlands could help maintain and restore important public uses of downslope lakes and rivers. However, on a site-specific level, retaining phosphorus in wetlands will have both positive and adverse effects on the ecological values of the wetlands themselves. In particular, the competition between algae and vascular wetland plants for phosphorus has complex implications for all trophic levels, and ultimately, overall wetland production and biodiversity. Also, some experienced observers have speculated that apparent declines in emergent plant species richness (and simultaneous increases in dominant stands of cattail) in some PPH wetlands might be the result of increased inputs of nutrients, including phosphorus (see section 4.9). Thus, the potential landscape-level values of some wetlands to effectively treat nonpoint nutrient runoff must be balanced against the likelihood that site-specific (and eventually, landscape) ecological values may compromised. For protecting most surface waters from these problems, the state of North Dakota specifies a criterion of 0.100 mg/l phosphate (Minnesota's is a similar 0.090 mg/l), but recommends a more stringent target value of <0.025 mg/l for lake improvement projects. Minnesota considers waters having <0.040 mg/l phosphorus to be fully supporting of all designated uses.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: Virtually all of the lakes in the PPR are considered hypereutrophic or eutrophic, according to annual 305b water quality reports. While this condition to some degree preceded human settlement, sediment cores indicate it has been aggravated by increasing agricultural and urban runoff (e.g., Allan et al. 1980). In South Dakota, 26% of the assessed river miles statewide have water quality that is so degraded it does not support any of their designated uses, and 44% show partial support; about 12% are not fishable due to water quality problems. Some 20% of the lakes do not meet their designated uses (SD Dept. Water and Natural Resources 1990). In North Dakota, 25% of the assessed river miles, and 36% of the lake acres, have water quality that is so degraded it does not fully support all of their designated uses (ND Dept. Health and Consolidated Laboratories 1990b).\n\nPublic opinion surveys indicate that many PPR citizens (e.g., 90% in survey by Grosz and Leitch 1990) think that wetlands are important for their ability to purify water. Although PPH basins are known to retain phosphorus, no attempts have been made to link quantitative estimates of phosphorus retention rates specifically from wetlands to ecological resources or to actual economic values associated with downslope use.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Throughout most of the PPR, runoff inputs to wetland basins are greatest during early spring. Often, this early spring runoff bears the largest portion of phosphorus-bearing sediment that enters wetlands. Much of the sediment phosphorus originates from lands tilled the previous autumn. Comparing two years (or locations) with equal amounts of total annual precipitation, the transport of phosphorus in sediment is likely to be much greater for the year (or location) in which, during the preceding autumn, a major rainstorm was followed by freezing, which then was followed by a snow cover that persisted through the winter and was followed by a warm early spring. Under such conditions, the large spring thaw is likely to mobilize considerable sediment-borne phosphorus. Conversely, springtime sediment runoff may be less during years (or locations) where winters are mild and lack continuous insulating snow cover. In other instances, springtime conditions affect phosphorus inputs to a greater degree than conditions during the preceding autumn or winter. Wetlands may retain a larger portion of the phosphorus borne by spring runoff during years when the runoff occurs later in the season, or during years when summer (vs. early spring) storms contribute a larger portion of the annual phosphorus input to wetlands. That is because as the season progresses, wetland soils thaw and vegetation develops more fully, thus increasing trapping efficiency. Any of the temporal effects just described can overwhelm the effects of spatial characteristics described in the following sections.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nRegional and landscape inputs of phosphorus depend partly on characteristic methods, rates, frequencies, and seasonal timings of fertilizer application. As shown in the detailed map by Omernik (1976), instream concentrations of phosphorus are greatest in Iowa, and decline in a generally westerly direction within the PPR. At least in Montana, phosphorus is the predominant plant nutrient applied as fertilizer (Bauder et al. 1991). Phosphorus inputs to wetlands from fertilizer can be inferred directly from fertilizer type and indirectly by soil and crop type (i.e., assuming particular fertilizers are associated with particular soils and crops). Fertilizer input to wetlands also depends on (a) type of cultivation and associated specific practices (e.g., conservation tillage, contour plowing, irrigation), (b) soil erodibility, as indicated by soil type and slope; (c) proximity of treated soils to wetlands, (d) transport mechanisms, as indicated by precipitation and water yield volume (White 1983) or their surrogates (e.g., rainfall/snowmelt intensity, watershed shape, soil type, and slope), and (e) width and type of buffer strips (vegetated, unfertilized sediment-filtering zones) surrounding wetlands. Use of upstream artificial drainage as an indicator of increased phosphorus input may depend on whether drainage is accomplished by ditches or subsurface tiles. Ditches draining PPR wetlands have been reported to have elevated levels of phosphorus (e.g., Malcolm 1979). In contrast, reports of water quality from watersheds drained by subsurface tile suggest lower phosphorus concentrations, at least after several years have passed following installation. This is probably because tile drains increase infiltration and thus reduce transport in overland flow. Landscape inputs of phosphorus may be indicated as well as by indicators of soil erosion, as described on page. Additional phosphorus enters wetlands from dry deposition (e.g., windborne sediments); groundwater (e.g., SDRCWP 1990); pesticide and road salt runoff; upslope wetlands (especially those with organic substrates) whose water levels have recently been drawn down following a period of stagnated, anoxic conditions in the sediment; and animals (e.g., livestock, waterfowl, sewage).\n\nCapacity for retaining phosphorus is related, on a landscape scale, to the spatial arrangement of wetland complexes relative to contributing land uses. Science has not advanced to the point where it is possible to specify all combinations of wetland spatial position, size, and type that are optimal for retaining phosphorus at a landscape scale, but it may be reasonable to assume that this would be roughly comparable to the pattern that would be optimal for retaining sediments. Again, the contagion characteristics of the wetland spatial distribution (e.g., proportion of subregional wetland acreage that is dispersed vs. clumped) are likely to affect both the potential extent of phosphorus input to wetlands and wetland capacity to retain it. Wetland acreage occurring as scattered complexes rather than as single large wetlands should, by chance alone, be more likely to be located near and downslope from phosphorus sources, providing more opportunities for input. At the same time, the larger shoreline-to-area (or smaller depth-to-volume) ratio associated with a more dispersed wetland acreage implies that a larger portion of phosphorus-bearing runoff will enter wetlands via aerobic shoreline zones of dense vegetation and weathered sediments, which have a high capacity for taking up and transforming phosphorus.\n\nThe basin water regime probably influences phosphorus retention. Water regime can be indicated generally by plant species, soil profile, landscape geology, relief, and geographic position. The drier wetland basins, such as temporary and seasonal types, probably have a larger proportion of their basin available for storage and infiltration of spring runoff, with concomitant deposition of suspended sediment and retention of phosphorus. These wetland types are also likely to have more weathered surface horizons, with consequently greater potential for phosphorus adsorption. However, the seasonally fluctuating water levels in temporary and seasonal wetlands may cause a large portion of the phosphorus pool to be biologically available. However, the phosphorus retention capacity in semipermanent and permanent basins is not negligible, because the higher salinity and alkalinity that typify these basins is conducive to precipitating phosphorus from the water column.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nMost of the site-specific indicators described for the functions, Maintenance of Runoff Timing (section 3.2), and Sediment Retention (3.4) are suitable as indicators of phosphorus retention. Again, the ratio of wetland size to watershed size, and the frequency and magnitude of connection to other basins are important indicators. Where concern focuses on phosphorus transformations within the open water portions of an individual wetland or lake basin, other indicators are appropriate. Phosphorus availability may increase if the basin is tilled or re-ditched during seasonal dryout periods or drought years, is shallow and exposed to strong winds (e.g., Kenney 1985), has steep banks of erodible soil, or contains animals that disturb shallow bottom sediments (e.g., carp, humans in boats). On the other hand, indicators of diminished capacity for dispersing phosphorus into open water (i.e., longer phosphorus turnover times) include alkaline soils with large calcium content; dense vegetative cover (both submerged aquatics and emergents) close to the path of incoming sediment; and high salinity. In the PPR, saline basins occur mostly in topographically low positions on glacial outwash in western and northern areas, whereas basins with calcitic water quality occur on glacial till in other areas.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES: The values of retaining phosphorus in wetlands can be indicated by the ecological, commercial, and recreational importance of the receiving waters relative to those of the retaining wetland, and their vulnerability as judged by factors described above under the discussion of indicators of inputs. All of the PPR states, in their 305b water quality reports, have listed water bodies impacted by nonpoint fertilizer runoff.\n\n3.6 Nitrogen Removal\n\nDESCRIPTION: Nitrogen removal is the process by which dissolved nitrogen (a) disappears from the immediate landscape as a result of being converted to gaseous forms, or (b) is retained for long periods within the sediments, water column, or biota of a wetland basin. While nitrogen is being retained within a basin, it can be converted from one form to another, e.g., from organic to inorganic.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: On landscape and regional levels, PPH wetlands would seem to retain or remove much of the nitrogen which enters them. As with phosphorus, this is due mainly to the physically closed nature of individual pothole basins with regard to surface water flow. Unlike phosphorus, which to some degree accumulates over time in such basins, nitrogen can be removed permanently from a basin. This happens mainly as a result of denitrification, a biologically-mediated process which converts nitrate to nitrogen gases. To a perhaps lesser extent, nitrogen may be lost from PPH wetlands by a process known as ammonia volatilization (e.g., Murphy and Brownlee 1981).\n\nIn one study in South Dakota, between one-third and one-half of the total nitrogen applied as fertilizer was removed from the landscape by denitrification (SDRCWP 1990). In semipermanent basin wetlands specifically, Davis and van der Valk (1978) in Iowa reported 86% removal of the inputted nitrate and 78% of the ammonia. An open lake system in South Dakota removed 44, 46, and 100% of the tributary nitrogen input during three successive years; this was less than the proportion of phosphorus removed (SDRCWP 1990). Two open wetland complexes in North Dakota removed 13 and 58% of the tributary nitrate, vs. a >10-fold increase from a drained wetland complex (Malcolm 1979). An unvegetated wet basin in South Dakota that was loaded with municipal wastewater removed 1765 kg N/ha (White and Dornbush 1988). On a regional basis, Jones et al. (1976) in northwestern Iowa found that of 34 watersheds, those with a larger percentage of land as wetlands had less nitrate in streamflow. Nitrogen can be removed temporarily from surface waters by being buried below the root zone in rapidly accreting sediments or by adsorption of ammonium nitrogen to clays (e.g., Martin and Hartman 1987a).\n\nIsolated PPH wetlands become sources rather than sinks for nitrate only when (a) biological materials from within a basin are dispersed outside the basin by mobile vertebrates, emerging insects, or severe runoff events that connect basins, (b) nitrogen-bearing sediments and plants are blown out of a wetland basin during seasonal dryout or drought years, or (c) denitrification rates are so low that nitrate accumulates and leaches into groundwater systems or laterally into subsurface flow, which may carry it into nearby wetlands.\n\nOn a site-specific level (within wetland basins), nitrogen may be repeatedly reduced and oxidized from ammonium to nitrate forms, with consequences for aquatic community structure. The potential for this to happen can be indicated by fluctuations in seasonal and annual wetland water levels, which in turn may be evidenced by soils with strong argillic horizons (Hubbard 1988).\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: On landscape and regional levels, because wetlands are among the most effective landscape features for denitrification (Groffman and Tiedje 1989) and are often located so as to intercept most runoff and groundwater, they also intercept much of the associated nitrate before it reaches larger, more permanent waterbodies. Thus, protection and enhancement of nitrogen removal functions of wetlands could help maintain and restore important public uses of downslope lakes, rivers, and aquifers. Fishing is very popular throughout the region, yet fish populations in many rivers and lakes are subject to die-offs as a result of oxygen depletions caused by excessive algal growth, which in turn had been stimulated by abnormal enrichment by nutrient-laden runoff. In surface waters of less than 3000 mmhos conductance (Barica 1978), algal blooms occur where there is excess nitrate (e.g., Moore and Haertel 1975). Perhaps of even greater public concern, nitrate in glacial outwash areas can readily infiltrate into groundwater and impair the quality of groundwater withdrawn for drinking. If wetlands play a measurable role in removing nitrate from ground or surface waters used or valued by the public, then wetland loss could increase the cost to taxpayers of measures to remediate contaminated groundwater or treat contaminated surface waters.\n\nOn a site-specific level, retaining nitrogen could have both adverse and positive effects on the ecological values of the wetlands themselves. In particular, the competition between algae and vascular wetland plants for nitrogen, while perhaps less important than competition for phosphorus, nonetheless has complex implications for all trophic levels, and ultimately, overall wetland production and biodiversity. Selective removal of nitrate by wetlands might trigger increased growths of blue-green algae that may be less useful to typical PPH food webs (cf. Barica et al. 1980). Also, some experienced observers have speculated that apparent declines in emergent plant species richness (and simultaneous increases in dominant stands of cattail) in some PPH wetlands might be the result of increased inputs of nutrients, including nitrogen (see section 4.9). Thus, the potential landscape-level values of some wetlands to effectively treat nonpoint nutrient runoff must be balanced against the likelihood that site-specific (and eventually, landscape) ecological values may compromised.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: Public opinion surveys indicate that many PPR citizens (e.g., 90% in survey by Grosz and Leitch 1990) think that wetlands are important for their ability to purify water. If wetlands are indeed effective for removing nitrate, then the currently degraded water quality in parts of the PPR where wetland losses have been greatest (e.g., Iowa) can be blamed at least partly on these past losses. In South Dakota, 26% of the assessed river miles statewide have water quality that is so degraded it does not support any of their designated uses, and 44% show partial support; about 12% are not fishable due to water quality problems. Some 20% of the lakes do not meet their designated uses (SD Dept. Water and Natural Resources 1990). In North Dakota, 25% of the assessed river miles, and 36% of the lake acres, have water quality that is so degraded it does not fully support all of their designated uses.\n\nGroundwater contamination by nitrate has also been widely documented. Wells having severe (>10 mg/l) levels of nitrate contamination comprise 17% of those in Montana PPR counties, 6% of those in Iowa PPR counties, and 2% of those in South Dakota counties. In one area of South Dakota (Oakwood-Poinsett watershed), 37% of the domestic wells exceeded 10 mg/l (SDRCWP 1990), a level hazardous to humans. In one area of the Minnesota PPR, 10 of 15 sampled wells exceeded the level (Wall et al. 1989). Groundwater with nitrate levels great enough to potentially produce adverse ecological effects in wetlands occurred in 38% of the South Dakota PPR counties (compiled from DeMartino and Jarrett 1991).\n\nWetlands remaining in the most contaminated areas, as well as in areas where groundwater is particularly vulnerable to contamination due to hydrogeologic conditions, are especially valuable to society because whatever nitrate they can remove reduces the severity of the local problem and its potential threat. Similarly, wetland restoration efforts whose primary objectives are nonpoint source management and drinking water protection might target such areas. All of the PPR states have mapped areas of groundwater vulnerability and/or groundwater contamination from nitrate over at least a portion of the state.\n\nAlthough PPH basins are known to remove nitrogen, no attempts have been made to link quantitative estimates of denitrification rates specifically in wetlands to economic values of maintaining fishing opportunities and groundwater quality in surrounding areas.\n\nTEMPORAL EFFECTS: Throughout most of the PPR, landscape inputs to wetland basins of nitrate (e.g., from fertilizer and livestock) are often greatest during early spring. Although wetland plants take up and store considerable nitrate at this time, they store most of it only temporarily. In contrast, denitrification results in permanent losses of nitrogen, and denitrification rates may be equal or greater at the beginning and end of the growing season than during mid-summer (Christensen 1985, Myrold 1988, SDRCWP 1990, Zak and Grigal 1991). Thus, denitrification functions in wetlands may be of greatest value in removing nitrate during years when runoff inputs occur early or late in the growing season. However, if runoff resulting from the spring melting of snow surrounding wetlands occurs prior to ice-out in wetlands, it flows under the ice, purging basins of anoxic, ammonia-rich water which can subsequently be released into receiving waters (if seasonal connections exist) without being substantially denitrified, thus causing water quality problems (ND Dept. Health and Consolidated Laboratories 990b). This adverse impact may be more likely to occur in landscapes dominated by semipermanent and permanent basins, because they tend to remain frozen longer into the spring.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF FUNCTION\n\nA. Regional and Landscape-level Indicators of Function\n\nPPH wetlands are focal points for nitrate accumulation. Regional and landscape inputs of nitrogen depend partly on characteristic amounts, methods, rates, frequencies, and seasonal timings of fertilizer application. This can be inferred directly from fertilizer type and indirectly by soil and crop type (i.e., assuming particular fertilizers are associated with particular soils and crops). Fertilizer input to wetlands also depends on (a) soil leaching potential, as indicated by soil type, crop type, and crop management practices (e.g., summer fallowing, irrigation, conservation tillage, contour plowing); (b) transport mechanisms, as indicated by precipitation and water yield or their surrogates (e.g., rainfall/snowmelt intensity, watershed shape, soil type, and slope), (c) proximity of treated soils to wetlands and connecting subsurface flow zones, and (d) width and type of buffer strips (vegetated, unfertilized, filtering zones) surrounding wetlands. As shown in the detailed map by Omernik (1977), instream concentrations of nitrate are greatest in Iowa, and decline in a generally westerly direction within the PPR. Most streams east of the Missouri Coteau exceed 1 mg/l nitrate on a mean annual basis. With regard to groundwater, the incidence of both actual and potential nitrate contamination is greatest in eastern South Dakota, Iowa, and southwestern Minnesota (Nielsen and Lee 1987).\n\nThe extent of artificial drainage upstream may also be a useful indicator of increased transport and nitrogen input. In other regions with flat terrain drained by agricultural ditches, watersheds which had less than 7% remaining wetland cover (Chescheir et al. 1987), were appreciably less effective for removing nitrate than were watersheds with more extensive wetlands (Bedient et al. 1976). Nitrate also enters wetlands via groundwater discharging from contaminated aquifers (e.g., many semipermanent and permanent basins in the eastern and southern PPR); from atmospheric deposition (e.g., White 1983); from nitrogen fixation processes of the cyanobacteria that dominate many PPH basins (e.g., Barica et al. 1980, Brownlee and Murphy 1983); and from animals (e.g., livestock, waterfowl, sewage). In fact, livestock feedlots (and perhaps also spills from fertilizer storage tanks) may be a more frequent cause of severe (>10 mg/l nitrate) groundwater contamination than is routine fertilizer application (Kross et al. 1990, SDRCWP 1990, Meyer 1985).\n\nCapacity for removing nitrate is partly related to regional-scale factors. Denitrification is probably hindered somewhat in the eastern PPR because soils of most wetlands there are relatively sulfur-poor; this deficit exacerbates competition among microbes for available carbon, thus reducing denitrification rates (pers. comm., J. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Except where irrigated and underlain by sandy soils, wetlands in the western part of the PPR would be expected to play a larger role in preventing groundwater contamination because they are both good sites for denitrification and tend to be areas of groundwater recharge.\n\nCapacity for removing nitrate is also related to landscape-scale factors, particularly the spatial arrangement of wetland complexes relative to contributing land uses and associated contaminated aquifers. Science has not advanced to the point where it is possible to specify all combinations of wetland spatial position, size, and type that are optimal for removing nitrate at a landscape scale. Nonetheless, the contagion characteristics of the wetland spatial distribution (e.g., proportion of subregional wetland acreage that is dispersed vs. clumped) are likely to affect both the potential extent of nitrate input to wetlands and wetland capacity to remove it. Wetland acreage occurring as scattered complexes rather than as single large wetlands should, by chance alone, be more likely to be located near and downslope from nitrate sources. Finally, the larger shoreline-to-area (or smaller depth-to-volume) ratio associated with a more dispersed wetland acreage implies that a larger portion of nitrate-bearing runoff will enter wetlands via shoreline zones which support high rates of denitrification due to their characteristic soils, fluctuating water levels, and high density of plants.\n\nB. Site-level (Within-wetland) Indicators of Function\n\nMost of the site-specific indicators described for the functions, Maintenance of Runoff Timing (section 3.2), and Sediment Retention (section 3.4) are suitable as indicators of nitrate removal. Thus, the frequency and magnitude of connection to other basins and the ratio of wetland size to watershed (or groundwater source) size, are important indicators.\n\nVolumetric soil moisture, as inferred from wetland water regime also is perhaps the most important indicator of denitrification capacity (Groffman and Tiedje 1989). Measurements of denitrification in a South Dakota wetland soil indicated that conditions of less than 22% volumetric soil moisture completely inhibit denitrification (Lemme 1988). A wetland does not have to be exposed to runoff for very long to reach these moisture levels and remove nitrate. In fact, studies of an emergent wetland by Lindau et al. (in press) showed that under loading rates typical of the PPR, denitrification begins within a day of when nitrogen enters a wetland, and reaches a peak at 7 days. Yet some citizens may not consider areas saturated for so brief a time to really be wetlands.\n\nOther factors associated with wetland water regime can be used to infer relative capacity for denitrification. First, water table levels fluctuate the most in temporary and seasonal wetland basins, partly as a result of both diurnal and seasonal evapotranspiration. Such fluctuations, from saturated to drained condition, are associated with switches in sediments between anoxic (anaerobic, or reduced) and oxic (aerobic, or oxidized) conditions. Fluctuating water levels might be expected to enhance denitrification so long as (a) anaerobic conditions still occur, (b) moisture levels in the upper soil layers are not too severely depleted (i.e., pore space is 30-60% water-filled; Linn and Doran 1984, Lemme 1988), (c) carbon supplies also are not limiting, and (d) salinity conditions are not extreme. Second, soil temperature might be expected to be warmer in temporary and seasonal wetlands during much of the year, due to their shallow depths. Third, denitrification can be hindered in wetlands lacking sulfatic soils (e.g., western parts of the PPR), as sulfate reduction processes compete for available carbon. This happens to a much lesser degree in temporary and seasonal wetlands than in semipermanent wetlands (pers. comm., J. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo).\n\nThus, on the basis of seasonal hydrologic fluctuations, warmer temperature, and diminished sulfate reduction processes, temporary and seasonal wetlands might be more capable of removing nitrate from surface runoff than are semipermanent and permanent basins. As noted by Kantrud et al. (1989), \"It would seem that temporary and seasonally flooded wetlands would be especially efficient in removal of excess nitrogen.\"\n\nHowever, other logic suggests that semipermanent and permanent wetlands might be more effective than temporary and seasonal wetlands for removing nitrate. Because semipermanent and permanent wetlands are usually groundwater discharge or flow-through systems, they are less susceptible to drought, and by definition, remain saturated and thus favorable to denitrification for longer periods. Prolonged drought in temporary wetlands not only results in moisture deficits inhospitible to denitrifying microbes, but also can result in diminuation (via mineralization) of organic matter essential for sustaining denitrifiers. Organic matter content of soils in semipermanent and permanent wetlands generally seems to be greater than in temporary and seasonal wetlands (however, Loken (1991) reported less organic matter in soils of semipermanent groundwater discharge wetlands; he attributed this to the inhibiting of production by the high salinity of these basins). Also, once nitrate has contaminated groundwaters, the permanent and semipermanent wetlands—which, often being groundwater discharge or flow-through systems, are in direct contact with the contamination for a longer portion of the year—may be expected to play a relatively larger role in removing nitrate.\n\nIn summary, it is probable (but generally undocumented) that in areas of sulfatic soils of the eastern PPR, semipermanent wetlands have a greater capacity to remove nitrogen than do temporary/seasonal wetlands, whereas in the western PPR or in areas with sandy soils or rapid infiltration, all wetland water regimes are about equally capable of removing nitrogen (pers. comm., J. Richardson, North Dakota St. Univ., Fargo). Overall, wetlands in the western part of the PPR would be expected to play a larger role than eastern PPR wetlands in preventing groundwater contamination, because they tend to be areas of groundwater recharge.\n\nSoil fertility is also an indicator of denitrification potential. Nitrogen removal by wetlands is typically greatest where soils are especially fertile (moderately alkaline clays with adequate organic matter) and have large water-holding capacity (i.e., saturated for long duration). Microbial biomass in North Dakota soils can be greater in areas underlain by siltstone than in areas underlain by sandstone or shale parent material (Schimel et al. 1985). Tillage and fertilization of soils over time also might increase the suitability of remaining soil carbon as an energy source for denitrifying microbes (Groffman et al. 1991). As a result, denitrification rates may be greater in wetlands that have been exposed to nutrient runoff than in relatively pristine wetlands (pers. comm., J. Kadlec, Utah State Univ., Logan).\n\nThe percent cover or root biomass of rooted plants (as possibly inferred from plant species or community type) is another possible indicator of denitrification capacity. Although some rooted plants are capable of \"pumping\" nitrates from the sediment into aboveground tissues and eventually into the water column, wetland plants also enhance denitrification by (a) enhancing the availability of carbon (e.g., from litterfall), (b) speeding the diffusion of oxygen (via roots) into otherwise anaerobic subsurface zones, especially during mid-growing season, and (c) increasing diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in the water table, and consequently the oxidation status, as a result of evapotranspiration. Denitrification may be greatest where soil organic matter reaches a maximum just below the soil surface, but above the depth limit of the root zone (Parkin and Meisinger 1989). In this zone, impeded lateral flow increases the time available for nitrate loads to interact with prolific microbial populations present in the surrounding root masses. A minor amount of denitrification can occur within shallow aquifers, depending on the amount of oxidizable organic matter that has infiltrated (Hiscock et al. 1991); this could in turn be greatly enhanced by recharge from carbon-producing temporary wetlands (e.g., Trudell et al. 1986). Although the effects of different native wetland communities on denitrification have not been determined in the PPR, limited studies elsewhere have found greater denitrification in grassy buffer strips than in forested wetlands (Groffman et al. 1991) and more denitrification in soils cropped with oat/clover cover than in those with corn (Fraser et al. 1988).\n\nIndicators such as basin hydrologic type and soil organic matter can be manifested on a regional level as well. That is, because these indicators correlate roughly with geologic and climate patterns within the region, in a general sense within-region spatial trends in denitrification might exist. For example, the occurrence of anaerobic conditions and fluctuating water levels might be greater in subregions where the wetland resource, due partly to geologic conditions, is comprised of proportionately more small, temporary, densely-vegetated wetlands with anoxic, under-ice conditions in winter.\n\nPOSSIBLE INDICATORS OF VALUES: The values of removing nitrate from the landscape can be indicated by the ecological, domestic, and recreational importance of the aquifers and receiving waters relative to those of the wetland, and their vulnerability as judged by factors described above under the discussion of indicators of inputs.\n\n3.7 Detoxification\n\nDESCRIPTION: For purposes of this report, detoxification is the process by which xenobiotic contaminants, including synthetic hydrocarbons and atypical concentrations of heavy metals, are converted from forms toxic to plants or animals to forms that are relatively harmless.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTION OCCURRENCE: On a landscape level, PPH wetlands would seem to retain much of the contaminant load that enters them, due largely to the physically closed nature of individual pothole basins with regard to surface water flow. However, studies of detoxification functions of PPH wetlands are lacking. Circumstantially, occurrence of natural detoxification processes might be inferred from the data of Martin and Hartman (1985). Their analyses of sediment and/or fish in five PPH basins found no evidence of toxic concentrations of PCBs or organochlorine pesticides, despite expected exposure. Isolated PPH wetlands become sources rather than sinks for contaminants only when (a) contaminants are highly soluble and infiltrate into underlying groundwater systems before they can be naturally detoxified, (b) contaminants from within a basin are dispersed outside the basin by mobile vertebrates or emerging insects, or (c) sediment-adsorbed contaminants are blown out of a wetland basin during seasonal dryout or drought years.\n\nOn a site-specific level (i.e., within wetland basins) contaminants may be transformed to less harmful substances by physicochemical processes or microbial communities. The former generally results only in deactivation of pesticides, while the latter results in actual degradation (Rao et al. 1983). Among various ecosystems, wetlands frequently have the largest year-round microbial densities (e.g., Henebry et al. 1981). In being detoxified, contaminants may be repeatedly reduced and oxidized (depending on seasonal and annual wetland water levels). Contaminants also may be cycled rapidly between sediments, biota, and water column (as well as between open water and marsh zones) by the highly productive and diverse biological communities. Detoxification mechanisms have generally not been studied in PPH basins. Although the theoretical occurrence of this function in PPH wetlands is inarguable, its mechanisms and extent are generally unknown in the PPR.\n\nASSOCIATED POTENTIAL VALUES: Contaminants impair potability of both groundwater and surface water, as well as having adverse ecological effects. Thus, contamination increases the cost to taxpayers of waste treatment plant construction and other remedial measures. On a landscape level, because wetlands are possibly among the most effective landscape features for retention and detoxification, and are generally located so as to intercept most runoff and contaminated groundwater, they may also intercept much of the contaminant load before it reaches larger, more permanent waterbodies. Thus, protection and enhancement of contaminant removal functions of wetlands could help maintain and restore important public uses of downslope lakes and rivers. However, on a site-specific level, retaining contaminants could impair the ecological functions and values of the wetlands themselves. Long hydraulic detention times, complex food webs, presence of many mobile species, and intrinsically high production rates in PPH wetlands could lead to severe problems with direct toxicity (e.g., Grue et al. 1986) or bioaccumulation as has been documented in wetlands elsewhere. Thus, the potential landscape-level values of some wetlands to effectively treat contaminated runoff must be balanced against the likelihood that site-specific (and eventually, landscape) ecological values may compromised.\n\nDOCUMENTATION OF VALUE: Pesticides, rather t"
