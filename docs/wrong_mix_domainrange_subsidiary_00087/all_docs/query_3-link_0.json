        "text": "** This can be downloaded as a PDF document by clicking here.**\n\nInterPore Journal is an open access, peer-reviewed international journal owned and published by the Society for Porous Media (InterPore). The breadth of topics covered by this journal will be as diverse as the membership of the actual society, however one does not need to be a member of the society to submit one’s work. We look forward to receiving your contributions linked to a porous media application. Submitted research may include, but is not limited to, physical and numerical modelling, imaging techniques and analysis, theory development, big data analysis, characterization, and/or material design.\n\nWe will only consider articles for publishing if they are original work and have not been previously published elsewhere and are not being considered for publication elsewhere. Electric preprints (a pre-publication version of an author’s work that has been deposited on a preprint server or institutional website prior to undergoing peer review at a journal) are acceptable as they are not considered a previous publication. However, the author must inform the editor in the cover letter at the time of first submission should their article be available as a preprint and provide a link to this preprint along with any relevant licensing information. Should the article later be accepted for publication in InterPore Journal, then the preprint publication should also be updated to include the reference to the published article along with its URL link and DOI.\n\nShould your article have been previously published as an abstract elsewhere, this should be mentioned in the cover letter including where and when it was published as an abstract, and if possible, a link to the published abstract.\n\nFor more information on the types of papers which we will be publishing, please see here.\n\nFor more information on the fees for publishing, please see here.\n\nPlease review the following author guidelines when preparing your work for submitting to InterPore Journal. Should any questions arise, please do not hesitate to contact the Managing Editor Laura Lenz at Laura.Lenz@InterPore.org.\n\nQuick Check Table\n\nFor easy reference, we have prepared a Quick Check Table that provides all relevant information in a table format. This can be downloaded as a pdf document here.\n\nSubmission\n\nAll articles should be submitted via the link provided on the journal website. Once submitted, all manuscripts will first undergo an initial review by the Managing Editor for completeness and then by the Editor-in-Chief to decide of suitable for the journal. Should no issues be found, the article will then be assigned to an Editor who will then manage the entire review process.\n\nAs part of the submission process, the submitting author must agree on behalf of all authors to the following statements:\n\nYou agree to have your data collected and stored in accordance with our privacy policy/statement.\n\nThis submission is an original submission which has not been previously published, nor is it currently being considered for publication elsewhere.\n\nAll authors are listed, all authors approve of the author order, all authors agree to the submission for publication consideration, and all authors have read and approved of the final text and are willing to be held accountable for the work.\n\nAll relevant information pertaining to this submission, including conflicts of interest, have been stated in the cover letter and relevant statements and declarations to your paper.\n\nAll relevant references which pertain to your work have been included in the reference list.\n\nWhen relevant, the necessary permissions have already been obtained for any items included in your paper, such as figures or tables, which originate from another source.\n\nDuring the submission process you will also have the chance to suggest potential reviewers as well as the names of any reviewers that should be avoided.\n\nShould any issues arise during the submission process, please contact the Managing Editor at Laura.Lenz@InterPore.Org.\n\nCover Letter / Comments for the Editor\n\nDuring the submission process, either a separate cover letter should be included with your manuscript files, OR the section labelled “Comments for the Editor” should be filled out during the first step of the submission process.\n\nWithin this letter or field, any actual or perceived conflicts of interest which the authors may have, including any conflicts of interest regarding possible reviewers, should be mentioned here. If there are no conflicts of interest, then this should be stated. If there is uncertainty regarding whether or not a conflict of interest exists, then please seek the advice of the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nFor further information on what may constitute a conflict of interest please see the following resources:\n\nICMJE Guidelines: https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/author-responsibilities--conflicts-of-interest.html\n\nAdditionally, authors should indicate which review process should be used. The following options are possible:\n\nDouble anonymized: The identities of both the reviewers and the authors are not given.\n\nSingle anonymized: The identities of the authors are known; the reviewers’ identities however are not known.\n\nOpen: The identities of both the authors and reviewers are known.\n\nShould your article be the result of cOAlition S funded research or related and/or the funder requires that your article be published under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) please state so in your cover letter. Unless otherwise specified, all articles will be published under the following Creative Commons license: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.\n\nIf your article has been deposited on a preprint server or institutional website as a preprint, this should be stated here and a link to the article should be provided.\n\nAny other relevant information which you would like to make the Editorial Office and Editors aware of should also be mentioned here. If any artificial intelligence technologies were used in the preparation of your paper or at any stage during the research process, this should be mentioned in the cover letter.\n\nRequirements for Double Anonymized Peer Review Process\n\nShould you prefer a double anonymized peer review process, please make sure to indicate this in your cover letter and to prepare your manuscript in such a way that the identities of all authors are concealed. No names or affiliations should be included anywhere in the manuscript or supplementary information (use in all caps the word “BLINDED” if necessary, so that this information can later be re-added). When referring to your own work, use neutral terminology. Include the Acknowledgements, Author Contributions, Conflicts of Interest, and all Author Names and Institutions in the Cover Letter. Remove any Author information from the metadata of the files to be submitted (go to Properties under the File menu in word processors and PDF readers). This is especially important with Revised work for which the setting “Track Changes”, when possible, should be activated.\n\nFile Type & Formatting and Style Considerations\n\nAll submissions should be done as a pdf file. Should your article be accepted, we will then need the original source files. We accept the following file types for the original source files: OpenOffice, Microsoft Word, LaTex, PDF or RTF document file format.\n\nWhen possible, please upload one PDF or word document which contains the title page, your main text and all figures, tables, diagrams, legends, footnotes and references. Any supplementary information should be uploaded as separate documents for review purposes. Should the figure, chart, or table be too large to be viewed properly when placed in the text, then submit as a separate file. ** Please however save all original files as the original files will be required for the publication stage should your paper be accepted.\n\nWhen formatting your paper, please use the following formatting guidelines:\n\nAll pages are numbered, and all lines are also numbered.\n\nText is 1.5 or double-spaced, uses an easy to read 12-point font.\n\nIllustrations, figures, and tables are placed within the text at the appropriate location.\n\nUse American English spelling, grammar, and style.\n\nTechnical terms, abbreviations and symbols are defined upon first use, jargon is avoided.\n\nUse standard SI units and leave a space between the quantity and the unit.\n\nWhen using mathematical symbols, leave a space on each side of the mathematical symbol.\n\nPolicy Regarding the Sharing of Data, Code & Protocols\n\nTo improve the transparency and reproducibility of the work published in this journal, we encourage all authors to make the data, code, and related protocols available for all at the time of publication. During the submission and review process, this material should be disclosed to the Editors at the time of submission and upon request made available.\n\nFor more information on this policy please see here.\n\nArticle Components\n\nAll articles, unless otherwise specified in the overview of article types, should include the following components:\n\nTitle page\n\nThis should include the full names, ORCID IDs if available, and institutional addresses of all authors. The institution(s) listed for each author should represent the institution where the work was done. If the author has since moved to a new institution, the current institution should also be indicated. If a collaboration group should be listed as an author, please list the group name. All individual members of a collaboration group can then be listed in the “Acknowledgements” section.\n\nPlease note that large Language Models (i.e. ChatGPT) or other artificial intelligence tools (AI) cannot be listed as an author. However, if a LLM or other AI tool was used, this should be documented in the Methods section. The corresponding author should also be indicated along with his/her contact details, including a permanent email address. Should first authorship be shared amongst two authors, please indicate this.\n\nIn order to be listed as an author, it is required that one has made substantial contributions to the work and has agreed to be held accountable for their work and its published form. If there is uncertainty as to who can be considered an author, please see the guidelines on Authorship from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, which are applicable for all fields. More information on this can be found here.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract should contain a brief and concise summary what was done, how it was done, what the main outcomes were and what it adds to the field. Please also feel free to submit a graphical abstract should this help in conveying the message of your work.\n\nAbstracts are not required for Commentaries on Previously Published Articles, Letters to the Editor, and Opinion Pieces.\n\nKeywords\n\nProvide at least 3 and up to 5 keywords or groups of words that represent the main content of your article.\n\nMain Text\n\nThe main text should contain the body of the article and can be broken down into (sub)sections with short and informative headings.\n\nThe following typical sessions, when relevant depending on article type, should be included: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion and/or Summary & Conclusions. The last section should include, when relevant, questions which could be addressed in future research and investigation.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWhen writing up your Materials and Methods section, please make sure to include enough information and details so that others can easily and successfully reproduce or build upon your experiment. One can choose to include a short version of the Materials and Methods with the main text of the paper, and a more detailed version of this with the Supplementary Materials. Information which can be included in the full version includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nComplex procedural details\n\nStep by step protocols that detail everything one needs to reproduce the method\n\nA listing of all materials and equipment used. This includes microscopes, objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter models, etc.\n\nA listing of all software packages used, including any image acquisition and processing software along with information on any key settings or processing manipulations used.\n\nWhich artificial intelligence (AI) assisted technologies were used and how.\n\nLegends\n\nA brief but descriptive Legend should be provided for all Figures, Tables, and Diagrams and be numbered (i.e., Figure 1, 2, 3; Table 1, 2, 3, etc.). References within the text to figures and tables should be written in full instead of abbreviated. The actual Legend should not be included in the actual text but set apart – either right next to or following the Figure, Table, or Diagram in your document, or included all together at the end.\n\nFigures, Tables, Diagrams, Charts\n\nPlease use color whenever possible, but keep in mind the following guidelines available on these websites when using color so that visually impaired readers will not run into issues:\n\nhttps://www.datylon.com/blog/data-visualization-for-colorblind-readers\n\nhttps://www.datylon.com/blog/data-visualization-for-visually-impaired-users\n\nAll figures should be provided in their original file format and with a minimum resolution of 150 DPI. Please use the following file formats: jpg, tiff, gif, png, or eps. When embedding picture files into the main text of the paper for the submission process, please also include the original file with your submission. Please also include information on all image-acquisition tools and image software packages (including version number) which were used.\n\nWhen submitting digital images, please try to keep the processing of these to a minimum. Some processing is acceptable, and in many cases is unavoidable. Final images however must be an accurate representation of the original data. All unprocessed data files should be saved in case it is necessary to provide them to the reviewers during the review process or following publication should an issue arise.\n\nThe Materials and Methods section should include information on all image acquisition tools and processing software that were used, including information on any key settings and processing manipulations. Please also include information on the type of equipment and acquisition software which has been used (microscopes, objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter models, etc.). If any manipulation has been done to an image, please also indicate what type of manipulation in the figure legend. Measured resolutions should also be indicated.\n\nFor all figures, tables, diagrams, or charts which have been borrowed or adopted from another publication, it is the authors responsibility to obtain permission from the original copyright holder(s) for re-use in an online publication, to provide us with a copy of this permission when submitting your paper, and to provide a credit line as supplied by the copyright holder.\n\nFor example: (Reprinted with permission from Lunstrum, A., Van Den Berghe, M., Bian, X., John, S., Nealson, K., West, A.J. (2023) Bacterial use of siderophores increases olivine dissolution rates by nearly an order of magnitude. Geochem. Persp. Let. 25, 51–55.).\n\nIf the borrowed work is from an Open Access article, it is still required to cite the original work.\n\nAbbreviations and symbols\n\nIf your paper contains a large number of abbreviations or symbols, a list of all should be provided at the end of your paper for easy reference.\n\nEquations\n\nAll equations should be numbered and referenced in the text with Eq. 1, 2, 3, etc. When used at the beginning of a sentence, then it should be spelled out. When letters are used in the equation or formula, they should be used in a manner that the capital letters can be clearly distinguished from the lowercase letters. Use an equation editor to create professional quality equations, either directly within the text or included as an image. All variables within the equation should be defined within the text directly prior to or following use unless the understanding and flow of the text is negatively impacted.\n\nFootnotes\n\nIf your paper also includes footnotes within the text, please have these labelled with raised lower-case letters.
