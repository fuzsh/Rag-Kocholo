Dramatic injectivity decline may occur due to salt precipitation pore clogging in high-salinity reservoirs, even over a short time frame. This study aims to elucidate the adverse impact of CO2-induced salt crystallization in porous media on the geomechanical properties of near-wellbore reservoir sandstones. As the impact of salt precipitation cannot be isolated from the precursor effects of interaction with CO2 and carbonic acid, we initiated our study by a comprehensive review of CO2 chemo-mechanical interactions with sandstones. We conducted laboratory geochemical CO2-brine-rock interactions at elevated pressures and temperatures on two sets of porous sandstone with contrasting petrophysical qualities. Two paths were followed: treatment with (a) CO2-acidified brine at 10 MPa fluid pressure and 60C for 7 days, and a second subset continuation with (b) supercritical injection until complete dry-out and salt precipitation. Afterward, the core samples were tested in a triaxial apparatus at varying stresses and temperatures. The elastic moduli of intact, CO2-reacted, and salt-damaged sandstones were juxtaposed to elucidate the extent of crystallization damages. The salt-affected specimens showed a maximum of 50 percent reduction in Young's and shear moduli and twice an increase in Poisson's ratio compared to intact condition. The deterioration was notably higher for the tighter rocks with higher initial stiffness.\n\nShow summary\n\nPorous materials in natural and engineered environments are subject to morphological changes resulting from interacting chemical and physical processes. The complexity of coupled flow, transport, and chemical processes that occur on different temporal and spatial scales makes it difficult to predict the resulting porosity and permeability alterations. Delineating the controls of mineral precipitation reactions is particularly challenging because it requires the implementation of nucleation criteria and precipitation attributes. By conducting pore-scale simulations, we studied how the amount and stochastic distribution of crystallites, controlled by nucleation, affect the pore geometry and permeability in two-dimensional porous structures. The observed relationships between porosity and permeability show characteristics that differ from ones that are typically applicable in dissolving porous media because of the clogging effect. Additionally, we propose a stochastic framework that upscales the co-evolution of permeability and porosity across length scales. This framework enables precise communication of clogging behavior to continuum-scale simulations based on statistical probability distributions of permeability-porosity variations.\n\nShow summary\n\nDuring CO2 storage, the near-wellbore environment experiences significant chemical, physical, thermal, and mechanical perturbations. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in this region through representative experimental tests and numerical simulations to maximize the safety and cost-efficiency of CO2 storage. One common shortcoming of current experimental methods is failing to facilitate access and replicate the in-situ brine sources within geological repositories, particularly saline aquifers. This failure can significantly alter the dynamics and dimensionality of mineral/crystal growth in porous reservoir rocks due to the availability and continuity of solute. To address this issue, we designed surface mineral precipitation tests and large-scale sandbox experiments to investigate salt precipitation and growth under two different scales and regimes in porous geometries. The laboratory results indicated massive salt accumulation close to the injection port and underlined the effect of solute availability and continuity on intensifying severity of salt accumulation. The observed continued growth highlights the importance of designing representative laboratory experiments in exploring fluid-rock interactions during carbon sequestration in the subsurface geological media.\n\nShow summary\n\nMineral precipitation reactions are critical in reactive transport studies of porous media due to their significant impacts on flow and transport properties. Understanding the nucleation process, a probabilistic phenomenon that determines the location and distribution of solid formation in space and time domains, is essential for accurately comprehending the effect of mineral precipitation on porous media surfaces. To this end, this paper presents microfluidic laboratory experiments and reactive transport modeling of mineral precipitation dynamics under different physicochemical conditions and substrate surface properties. Our results demonstrate the importance of the spatial and temporal location and distribution of nucleation and growth events when the interplay among several determining parameters is inevitable. We show mineral precipitation on primary and secondary substrate surfaces under different supersaturations and temperatures. Our high-resolution EDS-SEM surface maps identify the favorable sites and competing locations for attracting solute concentration and continued growth, providing valuable insights into the mineral precipitation mechanism.\n\nShow summary\n\nThe recent discovery of eight giant gas escape craters (GECs) in the Russian Yamal and Gydan peninsulas has challenged researchers for the past decade. Despite numerous proposed models, ranging from meteor impacts to gas explosions, none provide a comprehensive explanation for why the GECs are found only in this specific region. This study proposes a new general model for the formation of GECs in which local permafrost thinning is linked to the local geology, i.e., discrete conductive faults bring natural gas and heat to the base permafrost, deforming and melting the base leading to the development of domal gas and heat traps. Atmospheric warming results in further local thinning and eventually mechanical collapse. The morphology of the GECs initially reflects the concentric deformation above domal base-permafrost structures but are after a short time disguised by water and sediment infill, and over time peatification, and cannot be distinguished from e.g., thermokarst lakes. Thus, the true number of GECs may largely exceed those already discovered.\n\nShow summary\n\nEarly simulation works on carbonization during CO2 storage overpredicted the amount and rate of mineral formation because of unrealistic growth models based on transition state theory (TST), where surface areas for growth were assumed to be present from day one. Inspired by [1], we made our first nucleation-growth model a decade ago [2], providing a zero-dimensional averaged kinetic nucleation-growth model for the continuum scale. This model provided some information on lag time for the onset of mineral growth, which is essential to understand why the lack of mineralization in short-term laboratory experiments cannot be extrapolated in time. The continuum-scale models, however, lack the potential to predict how the pore space geometries change and, thereby, how the permeability-porosity relationship changes in complex ways. Recent efforts have been to implement mineral nucleation and crystal growth in pore-scale models, using classical nucleation theory (CNT) and statistically derived expressions for the induction time of the formation of stable growing crystallites. In the new expressions, the probability of creating a crystallite at each surface site (solid surface area in the pore space) is estimated based on a normal distribution centered around the mean induction time value [τ] (symmetric between t= 0 and 2τ). This has been implemented and tested in 2D pore-scale models, showing strong mutual relations and impacts of transport and crystallization in porous media [3-4]. Another emerging field for nucleation-growth research is how the number of crystallites (or aggregates) and their spatial distribution control the evolution of porosity-permeability relations. 2D nucleation-growth Monte Carlo-type pore-scale RTMs show that the permeability-porosity relationship and the associated uncertainty depend on the number of crystallites (Figs. 1, 2). The relationship evolves predictably if the number of crystallites is small or large. If, on the other hand, the number of crystals is in an intermediate range, the permeability-porosity dynamics vary stochastically and are highly uncertain.\n\nShow summary\n\nDeep-saline aquifers could be instrumental in the geological storage of carbon dioxide due to their relatively good reservoir properties, high volume, and prevalence. However, there are a few difficulties which should be overcome to obtain effective stores in such reservoirs. Most problems are related to formation damage caused by salt precipitation. Due to the complexity of such systems, it is necessary to identify crucial processes, phenomena, factors, and products. In our work, we present a novel platform to trace precipitation ‘in situ’ using microfluidics and Raman spectroscopy. We have built a set in which we can investigate not only the salt deposition phenomenon in pores or microchannels by visual observation but also, because of Raman spectroscopy, determine the kinetics of reactions, carbon dioxide solubility, phase composition, and crystal composition. On the basis of our research, we have identified intensive clogging of pores and fast growth of crystals on the rock-like grain boundaries and bottlenecks. Furthermore, in a 20% weight NaCl solution we have found precipitated carbonates, for example, nitrate. Our results can broaden our understanding of CCS in high-saline aquifers and contribute to the development and common use of this process.\n\nShow summary\n\nAmong the candidates for CO2 sequestration, deep saline aquifers are considered the best option because of their storage capacity and proximity to emission sources. Injection of large volumes (million tons scale) of supercritical CO2 into the geological formations causes evaporation of formation water near wellbores and precipitation of salt crystals inside the porous medium. CO2-induced salt precipitation can substantially threaten sequestration in saline aquifers. Most available experimental, numerical and theoretical works have focused on predicting the salt's location and amount. However, less attention is given to the precipitation physics, growth dynamics, and behavior of the fluid-solid interface near the evaporation/precipitation front. We report a series of experiments to provide new insights, beyond the current understanding, into the dynamics of brine evaporation and salt growth and to challenge the current understanding that might not be entirely representative of the field conditions. The research outcome highlights the interplay of complex processes (some of which are not yet fully characterized) crucial in investigating salt precipitation induced by million-tons-scale CO2 injection. The observed characteristics call for further in-depth investigation because, in the context of subsurface CO2 storage, we need to redefine how we see injectivity impairment due to salt precipitation.\n\nShow summary\n\nPrecipitation and growth of solid phases during a reactive fluid flow and solute transport are critical in many natural and industrial systems. Mineral nucleation and growth is a prime example where (geo)chemical reactions give rise to geometry evolution in porous media. The precipitation reactions can reduce the amount of void space, alter pore space connectivity and morphology, modify tortuosity, deteriorate permeability, and change the fluid flow and solute transport. Additionally, precipitation events reshape the available surface area for growth, leading to changes in reactivity, reaction progress, and reaction rates. The target is to ideally limit the mineral growth in many applications, such as avoiding damage to reservoir permeability due to solid precipitation near CO2 injection wells. In other cases, maximizing mineral growth in porous media can be highly favorable, such as sealing fractured caprocks or increasing mineral trapping in the sequestration sites. Understanding, controlling, and predicting this reactive transport phenomenon is challenging because it requires coupling flow, transport, and chemical processes often characterized by different temporal and spatial resolutions. Nucleation is the pre-growth process that controls the primary position of any mineral precipitation and subsequent growth dynamics. Mineral nucleation is a probabilistic process where crystals might nucleate anywhere given similar conditions, such as surface properties, supersaturation, and temperature. It is imperative to use a probabilistic approach or an upscaled physically sound representation to understand the effect of mineral precipitation on porous medium hydrodynamics. Motivated by the importance of incorporating stochastic dynamics of nucleation and growth kinetics in studying various multiphase and multiscale processes occurring in geo-environmental and geo-energy systems, this paper provides numerical and experimental insights into the recently proposed probabilistic nucleation model. We present laboratory experiments (microfluidic and flow-through column reactor) and pore-scale reactive Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) numerical simulations. As variations in the properties of the porous medium are intimately linked to the spatial distribution of the precipitation events, we quantify the evolution of experimental and numerical modeled systems at different physiochemical conditions by mapping the disorder of the system (Shannon's entropy) induced by the spatial mineral distributions across time. We use experimental and numerical results to show the importance of the spatial and temporal location and distribution of nucleation and growth events, particularly when the interplay among several determining parameters is inevitable. The results show that probabilistic nucleation contributes to broad stochastic distributions in both amounts and locations of crystals in temporal and spatial domains.\n\nShow summary\n\nIn the process of mineral nucleation and growth, substrate surface properties and substrate types introduce favorable areas where nucleation events are more likely to occur. The preferential sites for mineral nucleation exist because of the lower interfacial free energy between the precipitating phase and the substrate. In this work, we used a pore-scale Lattice Boltzmann (LB)-based reactive transport model incorporated with the developed probabilistic nucleation model in our previous works to investigate the role of the interfacial free energy between the nucleating phase and the substrate on the nucleation and growth of secondary minerals. We also used Shannon entropy to assess the spatial randomness and the evolution path of the systems as solid phases form. The results showed that the developed model can accurately capture the selective behavior of nucleation processes in the presence of preferential sites. The simulation results demonstrate the importance of using a probabilistic nucleation model to capture the correct physics of this phenomenon. It is also concluded that the probabilistic nucleation models are more relevant in environments with longer induction times.\n\nShow summary\n\nCrystal nucleation, precipitation, and growth during a reactive fluid flow and solute transport are critical in many natural and industrial systems. Mineral growth is a prime example where (geo)chemical reactions give rise to geometry evolution in porous media. Motivated by the importance of incorporating stochastic dynamics of nucleation, crystallization, and growth kinetics in studying a variety of multiphase and multiscale processes occurring in geo-environmental and geo-energy systems, this work presents experimental and numerical results delineating geometry evolution induced by mineral precipitation. A total of 27 microfluidic experiments (3×3×3 sets of supersaturation-temperature-time) extend the understanding of factors controlling crystal nucleation and growth rates, the impact of ambient and aqueous phase properties, and the substrate characteristics. For numerical simulations, we used the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to solve the advection-diffusion-reaction equation for tracking the concentration of different species. We developed a reactive transport model based on our recently proposed probabilistic nucleation and crystal growth theory. The results indicated the probabilistic nature of the process, which is affected by the physiochemistry of the aqueous phase and governed by fluid-solid surface interactions. We underscore the importance of theoretical reactive transport models considering the probabilistic nature of nucleation events before crystal formation.\n\nShow summary\n\nChemical interactions between CO2, brine and caprock-forming minerals might lead to the dissolution of the fractures present in the caprock of CO2 storage sites. One factor that can affect the chemically induced fracture alterations is mineral heterogeneity in the caprock. In this study, we investigate the effect of mineral heterogeneity on fracture dissolution of four carbonate-rich caprock samples, having different levels of heterogeneity, where CO¬2-rich brine flows through the fractured caprocks. A HPHT geomaterial microfluidic experimental setup is used to monitor the evolution of the fractures. Results indicate that the homogeneous caprock samples, i.e. the samples that are mainly composed of calcite, show a uniform fracture wall dissolution while fracture wall roughness increases for heterogeneous samples. The effluent chemistry analyses show that the sample-scale calcite dissolution rate decreases over time, which can be due to the mass transfer limitations in the boundary layer near the fracture wall (for the homogeneous sample) or in the altered layer formed around the fracture (for the heterogeneous samples). Microfluidic experiments were also done for one carbonate-rich fine-grained shale sample, which showed no detectable fracture alteration. However, the effluent analysis for the shale sample confirmed the calcite dissolution.\n\nShow summary\n\nA statistical methodology was presented for interpreting dynamic-to-static relationships. Respecting the importance of the Young’s modulus in seismic geomechanics, as case study was performed on the dynamic-to-static Young’s modulus conversion. To this end, six core samples from the studied oilfield were selected and in-situ stress curves were obtained. Next, in order to obtain static properties of the selected rocks, rock mechanics test were carried out under reservoir condition. In the same way, dynamic test was further performed using ultrasonic in the laboratory. Once finished with obtaining the static and dynamics values, simple linear regression and forward and backward stepwise multiple linear regressions were developed. Then empirical equations were developed for obtaining static Young’s modulus based on dynamic Young’s modulus, density, and porosity. Next, the developed formulations were interpreted by the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that, due to the small sample size, the regression analysis alone could not provide significant relationships, highlighting the important roles of other statistical methods (e.g., F-test and t-test) in the reliability evaluation of the relationships. The findings of the present article provide a methodology for obtaining regression-based relationships for seismic geomechanics and reservoir modelling applications, especially where limited core samples are available.\n\nShow summary\n\nChemical interactions between CO2, brine, and caprock-forming minerals might lead to dissolution of the fractures present in the caprock of CO2 storage sites.

It is paramount to predict the location of mineral precipitation besides their amount for understanding the fate of transport properties. However, current models and simulation approaches fail to predict precisely where crystals will nucleate and grow in the spatiotemporal domain. We present a new mathematical model for probabilistic mineral nucleation and precipitation. A Lattice Boltzmann implementation of the two-dimensional mineral surface was developed to evaluate geometry evolution when probabilistic nucleation criterion is incorporated. To provide high-resolution surface information on mineral precipitation, growth, and distribution, we conducted a total of 27 calcium carbonate synthesis experiments in the laboratory. The results indicate that nucleation events as precursors determine the location and timing of crystal precipitation. It is shown that reaction rate has primary control over covering the substrate with nuclei and, subsequently, solid-phase accumulation. The work provides insight into the spatiotemporal evolution of porous media by suggesting probabilistic and deterministic domains for studying reactive transport processes. We indicate in which length- and time-scales it is essential to incorporate probabilistic nucleation for valid predictions.\n\nShow summary\n\nInvestigating fracture evolutions triggered by chemical interactions in caprocks of CO2 storage sites is of great importance when caprock integrity is concerned. Mineral heterogeneity is one of the factors affecting fracture evolution. We present results from flow-through experiments deploying a unique high pressure geo-material microfluidic cell to monitor the fracture evolution of four carbonate-rich caprocks: (1) a homogeneous carbonate-rich sample, (2) a heterogeneous carbonate-rich sample, (3) a heterogeneous carbonate-rich shale sample, and (4) a heterogeneous carbonate-rich organic shale sample, representing different levels of mineral heterogeneity. The results show rather smooth fracture wall dissolution for the homogeneous rock sample. For the heterogeneous sample without shale, however, an altered layer is formed around the fracture that leads to an increase in the fracture roughness. Chemical analyses of effluent solutions demonstrate a decrease in the bulk dissolution rate of calcite over time at a constant flow rate. For the two carbonate-rich shale samples, visual observations using optical microscopy showed little changes in fracture dissolution, although analysis of effluent chemistry confirmed calcite dissolution.\n\nShow summary\n\nLarge-scale CO2 storage requires advanced understanding of the geomechanical response of the caprock subject to pressure build- up in the reservoir. CO2 injection into basin systems will need to approach rates of 100 Mt/y in order to achieve significant reduction in worldwide emissions and realize the large capacity of saline aquifers. High pressure build-up is expected, which may activate existing fractures and faults in the seal and create leakage pathways for the CO2 plume. New fractures may also evolve at higher pressures. To avoid creating leakage pathways for the CO2 plume, the pressure must be kept under an upper bound that is determined by the caprock weakest point or initial stress. To date, there has been great uncertainty in critical knowledge needed for planning and execution of safe large-scale CO2 storage projects. Within the PROTECT project, we advance methods and reduce uncertainty regarding the mechanical response. The research study focuses on three subareas: data collection, experimental studies and computational tasks. The studies are performed at small scale (scale of individual cracks, cm to m) and at large scale (reservoir or basin scale, 10 m to km). Data are synthesized, and a benchmark study of large-scale geomechanical simulation is performed. The Utsira Formation on the Norwegian continental shelf has been used as a common case study for integration and benchmarking activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future research based on knowledge gained in this study.\n\nShow summary\n\nNucleation and growth of secondary mineral phases is of great importance in a variety of processes in different fields. Mineral precipitation alters the morphology and hydrodynamics of the porous media by blocking the pore and throats and changing the tortuosity and permeability of flow paths. Even reaction rates are affected by the reshaping of available reactive surfaces. Any mineral precipitation process begins with the nucleation, which is a probabilistic phenomenon. It is often overlooked in studying the reactive transport phenomena. Nucleation controls the location and timing of crystal formation in a porous structure. The spatial distribution of stable secondary nuclei is crucial to precisely predict the hydrodynamics of the porous medium after mineral precipitation. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mineral nucleation and growth process is essential and it is necessary to develop a new probabilistic nucleation approach that could produce more reliable results. Accordingly, we have developed a new probabilistic nucleation model and incorporated it into a pore-scale Lattice Boltzmann reactive transport model to investigate the effect of various factors such as saturation ratio, flow rate, temperature, interfacial free energy, nucleation rate, and growth rates on the distribution of precipitated secondary minerals. In our model, the probabilistic induction time statistically spreads around the measured or reported induction time, either obtained from experiments or approximated by the exponential nucleation rate equation suggested by the classical nucleation theory (CNT). We provide a detailed explanation on how to implement the developed probabilistic nucleation approach into pore-scale reactive transport models. We also gave a thorough description of each parameter of the probabilistic nucleation model and how to measure or calculate them for different fluid and rock systems. Additionally, we used a new approach to measure the disorder of the spatial mineral distributions. The developed models provide new insights into the spatiotemporal evolution of porous media during mineral precipitation. Furthermore, the outcomes provide the basis for implementing mineral nucleation and growth for reactive transport modeling across timescales and length-scales.\n\nShow summary\n\nMineral nucleation and growth are prime examples of (geo)chemical reactions giving rise to geometry evolution during reactive flow and transport in porous media. The precipitation reactions can reduce porosity, alter pore space connectivity and morphology, modify tortuosity, and deteriorate permeability. Therefore, change the fluid flow and solute transport. Additionally, precipitation reshapes the available surface area for growth, leading to changes in the system's reactivity, reaction progress, and reaction rates. As the probabilistic nucle-ation model highlights, it is necessary to delineate both amount and location of nucleation and precipitation events in the spatiotemporal domain for precise prediction of changes in transport properties. This work aims to improve the understanding of factors controlling crystal nucleation and growth rates, the impact of ambient and aqueous phase properties, and the substrate characteristics. To explore the effect of solute concentration, temperature, and experimental elapsed time on the surface coverage area and the number of precipitated crystals , we carried out a total of 27 mineral synthesis experiments on the surface of heterogeneous quartz-rich sandstone with a solution stoichiometry of close to 1 (Ca/CO3 ≈ 1). The tests were performed at three temperatures (T = 20, 40, and 60℃) and three supersaturations (Ω = 15, 50, and 130x). The principal objective was to evaluate solid formation at different controlling conditions when the solid-liquid interface plays a key role. Effects of primary and secondary substrates and control imposed by preferential precipitation locations are identified and discussed. The results indicate that supersaturation and temperature imposed control on the amount, distribution pattern, and growth rate of crystals while the phenomenon still being probabilistic. Substrate characteristics governed the nucleation and crystal growth location and stochastic dynamics across time and space evolution. Moreover, substrate surface properties introduced preferential sites that were occupied and covered with solids first. For reactive transport modeling, in addition to porous medium's geometry and aqueous phase properties, a stochastic nucleation and growth model is necessary to implement substrate surface properties and compute solute transport and fluid flow for different spatial and temporal locations distinctively.\n\nShow summary\n\nA new probabilistic nucleation model to predict crystal growth in porous medium Tuesday, 1 June 2021 15:10 (15 minutes) Nucleation is the first step of any mineral precipitation and crystal growth process. It is often overlooked in studying the reactive transport phenomena. Nucleation controls the location and timing of crystal formation in a porous structure. The spatial distribution of stable secondary nuclei is crucial to predict hydrodynam-ics of the porous medium after mineral precipitation precisely. To better understand the nucleation process, we developed a new probabilistic nucleation approach in which the induction time is considered a random variable. The random induction time statistically spreads around the measured or reported induction time, either obtained from experiments or approximated by the exponential nucleation rate equation suggested by the classical nucleation theory. In this work, we utilized inputs from the classical nucleation theory. In our model, both location and time of nucleation are probabilistic, affecting transport properties in different time-and length-scales. We developed a pore-scale Lattice Boltzmann reactive transport model and implemented the new probabilistic nucleation model to investigate the effect of nucleation rate and reaction rate on the extent, distribution, and precipitation pattern of the solid phases. The simulation domain is a 2D substrate with an infinite source of the supersaturated solution. We use Shannon entropy to measure the disorder of the spatial mineral distributions. The results of the simulations show that all the reactions follow similar random behavior with different Gauss-Laplace distributions. The simulation scenarios start from a fully ordered system with no solid precipitation on the substrate (entropy of 0). Entropy starts to increase as the secondary phase precipitates and grows on the surface until it reaches its maximum value (entropy of 1). Afterward, the overall disorder declines as more surface areas are getting covered, and eventually, entropy approaches a constant value. The research results indicate that the slower reactions have longer windows of the probabilistic regime before entering the deterministic regime. The outcomes provide the basis for implementing mineral nucleation and growth for reactive transport modeling across timescales and length-scales.\n\nShow summary\n\nGeological CO2 storage and CCS have a crucial role in reducing CO2 emission and therefore mitigating climate change. One of the prerequisites for selecting CO2 storage sites is a low permeability caprock preventing potential CO2 leakage and migration from the storage reservoir. The presence of fractures in the caprock can adversely affect the sealing capacity of caprocks. Chemical interactions between CO2, brine, and caprock-forming minerals can cause fracture evolution, which results in changes in the transmissivity of fractures within the sealing layers. One factor that can affect the chemically induced fracture alterations is mineral het-erogeneity in the caprock. In the present work, we investigate the effect of mineral heterogeneity on fracture geometry evolution when CO2-rich brine flows through a single fracture scribed on different carbonate-rich caprock samples. The rock samples have different carbonate contents and different levels of mineral hetero-geneities. They can represent carbonate-rich caprocks such as some intervals of the Upper Jurassic (Kimmerid-gian) Draupne shales, the caprock for Smeaheia CO2 storage in Norway. An HPHT geomaterial microfluidic experimental setup is used to monitor the evolution of the fractures. Results indicate that the homogeneous caprock samples, i.e., the samples mainly composed of calcite, show a uniform fracture wall dissolution while fracture wall roughness increases for heterogeneous samples. The effluent chemistry analyses show that the sample-scale calcite dissolution rate decreases over time, which can be due to the mass transfer limitations in the boundary layer near the fracture wall (for the homogeneous sample) or the altered layer formed around the fracture (for the heterogeneous samples). Microfluidic experiments were also done for one carbonate-rich fine-grained shale sample, which showed dissolution of calcite with no macroscopic fracture alteration during the ten-day experiment. This indicates that in shale samples where the carbonate minerals, mainly calcite, are armored with other slow reacting minerals such as clays, the rate of fracture geometry evolution will be prolonged, which might be a positive point for the caprock integrity. However, the confirmed fluid-rock geochemical interactions within the shaly sample in a short time frame call for further investigations on the consequent impacts on caprock samples' geomechanical-hydrological properties for more extended periods relevant for subsurface CO2 storage. The microfluidic experiments are also used to validate a reactive transport model. The model will then be utilized to study changes in transport properties of different samples during experiments. The LBM-based model outputs, such as porosity-permeability relationships, can inform reactive models at larger scales to develop a better predictive numerical simulator for processes involved in CO2 storage projects."
