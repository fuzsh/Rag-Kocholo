The European Union emissions trading system (EU ETS) is a cornerstone of the EU’s efforts towards a cost-effective fight against climate change. This study examines the effectiveness of the EU ETS by analyzing monthly data from December 2008 to December 2021, with the focus on CO2 emission allowance futures prices, renewable energy indices, coal prices, oil prices, and fossil energy indices. The key findings are as follows: The CO2 emission allowance futures prices have averaged EUR 14.83 per ton, ranging from EUR 2.87 to EUR 76.81, which shows a significant upward trend. The renewable energy index also demonstrated strong growth, with a mean 1562.07 and maximum 4571.96. Coal prices have averaged EUR 65.32 per ton, while Brent oil prices averaged EUR 59.85 per barrel. A cointegration analysis revealed a long-run equilibrium relationship between these variables. The Vector Error Correction model (VECM) revealed significant negative responses to long-run equilibrium deviations of the renewable energy index (−0.0155) and oil prices (−0.0236), a significant negative short-run response of CO2 prices to their own lagged values (−0.223), and a significant positive short-run effect of oil prices on the fossil energy index (0.254). These results suggest the EU ETS has created significant linkages between carbon, energy, and financial markets. The study concludes that while the EU ETS has made progress in motivating emissions reductions and promoting renewable energy, the system’s efficacy still needs improvement.

Hence, this paper aims to deepen the understanding of biomass conversion processes and provides valuable insights for advancing biomass-based energy systems. Firstly, the weight loss characteristics of the larger particles of eucalyptus, pine, acacia, and olive samples were investigated at different isothermal temperatures in a purpose-built reactor that simulates the devolatilization process in a controllable manner. As opposed to the thermogravimetric analysis using thermally thin particles, it was concluded that all fuels show that the combustion of large particles does not exhibit separate consecutive conversion stages, due to internal diffusion resistance. Furthermore, it was verified that the devolatilization rate depends mainly on the reactor temperature, and, consequently, the mass-loss profile is independent of the biomass type. In addition to these experiments, the composition of the gases over the devolatilization period was analyzed for the main fuel used in power plants, eucalyptus. Once again, a strong correlation to the reactor temperature was observed, with CO2 and CO always being the main devolatilization products. The temperature dependence of both compounds presented an increase from 8 to 13% between 600 and 800 °C for CO, while the CO2 yield only slightly increased from 11 to 12%. These observations were essential to identify the transport phenomena effect and the gaseous products released during the biomass combustion.

In particular, multi-phase induction machines are an important field due to their inherent robustness. Tuning of the inner loop (speed) and outer loop (current) is typically tackled separately. The problem of trade-off analysis for the tuning of both loops has never been tackled before, which motivates the present study. This paper examines the complex and non-linear relationships between commonly used performance indicators in variable speed applications. The paper shows that there are links between performance indicators for both loops. This prompts a more detailed study of concurrent tuning. Also, it is shown that said links are, in a variable speed drive, dependent on the operating point. This requires studying more than just one operating point. Experimental results for a five-phase induction motor are used to validate the analysis.

In recent years, the use and emission of SF6 have been rising, and with the proposal of the dual carbon strategic goal, its harmless degradation has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, SF6 was degraded by pulsed DBD plasma technology and O2. Studies have shown that the addition of O2 can effectively promote the degradation of SF6. With the increase in the added O2 content, the DRE and EY of SF6 first increased and then decreased. Under the conditions of the input power of 50 W, SF6 concentration of 2%, and gas flow rate of 50 mL/min, the reaction system obtained the highest DRE and EY of 58.40% and 5.24 g/kWh when the O2 content was 1%, respectively. In the SF6/Ar/O2/H2O system, the addition of H2O could improve the product selectivity of SO2F2, and when the O2 concentration was 1%, the highest selectivity of SO2F2 was 48.96%, and the concentration was 8006.76 ppm. The addition of O2 inhibited the production of SO2, and with the addition of the O2 system, SO2F2 and SOF4 were the main components of degradation products; however, there were also SOF2, SO2, SiF4, SF4, etc. In this paper, the decomposition path of O2 under SF6 was analyzed in detail according to infrared spectroscopy and decomposition products.

This study introduces the overall design of a 4 kW air compressor aimed at achieving a green vision for agricultural machinery. The design focuses on providing continuous and stable power and air output using a lithium-ion battery. Durability and cost-effectiveness are prioritized, with a particular emphasis on the Arduino system for integrating battery and motor systems to withstand harsh conditions and ensure ease of maintenance. A permanent magnet brushless motor was selected as the power source, paired with an optimized pulley to supply the proper torque to the air compressor. The system employs an Arduino-based feedback control sensor for air pressure regulation, ensuring energy efficiency. The primary energy source is a 48 V lithium iron phosphate battery, known for its high energy density and safety. The battery design focuses on system integration, addressing specific environmental discharge requirements. The embedded battery management system provides thermal and lifecycle parameter estimation, guaranteeing long-duration power supply and safe operation under various conditions. Unlike traditional fuel-driven systems, lithium iron phosphate batteries do not emit harmful gases, aligning with environmental standards. System integration testing demonstrated that the air pressure feedback control effectively meets the energy-saving requirements by digitally reducing power output as air accumulates in the chamber. Bench testing confirmed that the system performs as designed, achieving the desired results and advancing the goal of sustainable agricultural machinery.

Unlike natural gas, which is mainly composed of methane, syngas contains a mixture of combustible CO, H2, and CnHm. Therefore, optimizing its production requires a thorough examination of various operational parameters such as the gasifying agent, the equivalence ratio, the biofuel type, and the state, particularly in densified forms like pellets or briquettes. As new biomass sources are continually discovered and tested, operational parameters are also constantly evaluated, and new techniques are continuously developed. Indeed, these techniques include different gasifier types and the use or non-use of catalysts during biofuel conversion. The present study focuses on these critical aspects to examine their effect on the efficiency of syngas production. It is worth mentioning that syngas is the primary gaseous product from gasification. Moreover, it is essential to note that the pyrolysis process (prior to gasification) can produce, in addition to tar and char, a mixture of gases. The common feature among these gases is their versatility in energy generation, heat production, and chemical synthesis. The analysis encompasses the resulting gas features, including the yield and composition, mainly through the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio and the carbon monoxide-to-carbon dioxide ratio, as well as the lower heating value and considerations of the tar yield.

To improve the response speed and anti-interference capability of the FSBB converter, this paper proposes an adaptive global fast integral terminal sliding mode control method. Through an in-depth analysis of the fundamental characteristics of the FSBB converter, this study employed a global fast integral terminal sliding mode controller combined with an adaptive algorithm to significantly improve the dynamic performance and robustness of the FSBB converter. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method could track the reference voltage quickly and accurately in different modes, exhibiting excellent system robustness compared to conventional sliding mode control, terminal sliding mode control, and PID control methods.

Using gas reservoir numerical simulation to assist development has greatly improved the work efficiency of workers. However, traditional gas reservoir numerical simulation is widely criticized for its inability to effectively integrate with geological and engineering factors. In this study, we proposed a geological engineering integration method that considers pre-fracturing parameters. We further applied it to a typical well (N03) in a certain block of the Sichuan Basin. The reliability of the method was determined through historical fitting. Based on the N03 geological model, the optimization range of fracturing construction parameters in adjacent areas was determined with the goal of maximizing EUR. Recommended values for widely distributed construction parameter combinations of Class II reservoirs were provided through orthogonal analysis. The influence order of fracturing construction parameters is (1) sand addition strength, (2) cluster spacing, (3) construction displacement, (4) fracture fluid strength, and (5) horizontal segment length. Finally, we compared the simulated data with the actual case. The results showed that an integrated numerical simulation method including geological and engineering factors can comprehensively and accurately assist in reservoir development.

However, degradation is still an issue for this type of component, affecting their durability and performance. In this scenario, a detailed analysis of the anodic and cathodic distributors’ flow-field geometry may help to identify some local stressors that trigger the degradation mechanism, such as local hot spots and reactants not having a uniform distribution. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methodology is able to provide a volumetric description of a PEM fuel cell so it can be a useful tool to better understand the physical phenomena that govern the component operations. In this work, the open-source simulation library openFuelCell2 is adopted for a detailed analysis of two different PEM fuel cells characterized by standard distributor geometries, namely a parallel channel geometry and a serpentine configuration. The library, based on the OpenFOAM code, has been extended with a novel implementation accounting for the catalytic activity reduction due to the platinum oxide (PtOx) formation occurring under certain particular conditions. The adopted methodology is firstly validated resorting to experimental data acquired for the two different fuel cell configurations. The analysis highlights that the PtOx formation leads to a reduction in the fuel cell performance reaching up to 60–80% when operating at high voltages. Then, the effect of the distributor geometries on the component performance is investigated by resorting to in-plane and through-plane physical quantity distribution, such as reactant concentration, pressure or velocity fields. While the parallel flow channel configuration shows some diffusion losses under the rib, the serpentine channel geometry configuration can achieve some local performance peaks thanks to the convective flow in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) driven by local pressure gradients. Furthermore, the local enhancement in terms of higher current density under the rib is associated with an effective heat removal due to the high thermal capacity of the bipolar plate, avoiding the generation of local hot spots.

This paper proposes a grid-forming control for such a system. The inverter control consists of the inner dq-axis current control, the dq-axis voltage control, the phase-locked loop (PLL) based frequency control, and the DC voltage control. The proposed control embeds the PLL into the grid-forming inverter control, offering the advantages of better synchronization and fault current-limiting capability. With the proposed control, the battery energy storage is able to provide inertial and primary frequency support during the grid frequency disturbance. Simulation models are established in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the results during the active power variation and AC voltage variation, the grid frequency disturbance, grid fault, and mode switch validate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

The novelty of this work derives from our use of a new heat exchanger design for a domestic shower, and from the presented experimental–numerical evidence that proves its efficiency. We found that use of our newly designed appliance improved thermal efficiency from 14% to 27%. Moreover, we estimated that the cost of manufacturing and installing such a device did not exceed that of a widely available drain grid. Using our newly designed exchanger, a family of four living in Poland could save EUR 38 (at 2022 values) and reduce CO2 emissions by 192 kg. An average European family could save EUR 68 and reduce CO2 emissions by 76 kg.

However, the DC-side inductor current is not a real current source and is generated by a DC voltage supply and an inductor. Under different switching states, the DC-side inductor will be charged or discharged, which leads to the DC-side inductor current being discontinuous or increasing. To solve the control problem of the DC-side inductor current of the CSI, a novel single-phase CSI topology with five switching tubes for grid-connected applications is proposed. Firstly, the reference calculation method and the hysteresis loop control scheme for the DC-side inductor current are proposed, and the adjustable and constant DC-side inductor current are obtained. Since the PWM signals cannot be directly implemented to the switching tubes, the modulation strategy for the single-phase CSI is proposed in this paper. Then, an active damping method based on the feedback capacitor voltage is presented to suppress the resonance peak caused by the LC filter on the grid side. Finally, the math model of the AC-side structure is established, and the optimal proportional-resonant controller parameters’ design method is explored by the amplitude–frequency characteristic curves. The simulation and experiment are implemented for the proposed CSI topology. The results show that a high-quality power with a good control performance can be obtained with the proposed CSI topology.

Thus, DR has a certain substitution role for ESS, but unlike DR, ESS planning has a coupling relationship between years, which makes it difficult to guarantee the reasonableness of the ESS planning results by considering only a single year. To achieve the optimal construction timing of ESS, this paper develops a consecutive year-by-year framework integrating DR and ESS to analyse and quantify the substitution effect of DR on energy storage while realizing year-by-year ESS planning. Our methods are as follows: (1) A consecutive year-by-year DR model and an ESS model are proposed; (2) These two models are combined together to achieve the purpose of considering DR in the ESS planning stage. Here, system reserve, renewable energy consumption, and preservation of power supply are given consideration to optimise the reliability and economy of the system; (3) The method is validated using a provincial real-world power grid in the eastern part of China. The optimal results of five consecutive years of planning show that DR substitutes 19.7% of the ESS capacity.

The bidirectional airflow inside the OWC drives the Wells turbine connected to a generator to harness energy. This study evaluated the aerodynamic performance of two hybrid airfoil (NACA0015 and NACA0025) blade designs with variable chord distribution along the span of a Wells turbine. The present work examines the aerodynamic impact of the variable chord turbine and compares it with one with a constant chord. Ideally, Wells rotor blades with variable chords perform better since they have an even axial velocity distribution on their leading edge. The variable chord rotor blade configurations differ from hub to tip with taper ratios (Chord at Tip/Chord at Hub) of 1.58 and 0.63. The computation is performed in ANSYS™ CFX 2023 R2 by solving three-dimensional, steady-state, incompressible Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with a k-ω Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model in a non-inertial reference frame rotating with the turbine. The accuracy of the numerical results was achieved by performing a grid independence study. A refined mesh showed good agreement with the available experimental and numerical data in terms of efficiency, torque, and pressure drop at different flow coefficients. A variable chord Wells turbine with a taper ratio of 1.58 had a peak efficiency of 59.6%, as opposed to the one with a taper ratio of 0.63, which had a peak efficiency of 58.2%; the constant chord Wells turbine only had a peak efficiency of 58.5%. Furthermore, the variable chord rotor with the higher taper ratio had a larger operating range than others. There are significant improvements in the aerodynamic performance of the modified Wells turbine, compared to the conventional Wells turbine, which makes it suitable for wave energy harvesting. The flow field investigation around the turbine blades was conducted and analyzed.

Implementing market-oriented, grid-, and system-serving use cases must be tailored to the different national framework conditions, both in technical and regulatory terms. This paper sets out an evaluation methodology for assessing the implementation of smart and bidirectional charging use cases in different countries. Nine use cases are considered, and influencing factors are identified. The evaluation methodology and detailed analysis are applied to Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden. In every country, the implementation of vehicle-to-home use cases is possible. Realising market-oriented use cases is feasible in countries with a completed smart meter rollout and availability of tariffs with real-time pricing. Grid-serving and ancillary service use cases depend most on country-specific regulation, which is why no clear trend can be identified. Use cases that require direct remote controllability are the most distant from implementation. The overarching analysis provides orientation for the design of transnational products and research and can serve as a basis for a harmonisation process in regulation.

The North Denmark Region has favourable conditions for the production of carbon-based fuels. The region has high availability of CO2 sources and a strategic position for establishing CO2 hubs in the local harbours that could support biogenic CO2 availability in the future. This paper investigates the potential of the region for exporting e-methanol through 22 energy system scenarios and the impacts on the energy system if this is to be realised by 2030 and 2045, when Denmark is expected to achieve its national climate goals. The analysis highlights the significant potential of this region to contribute to e-methanol production not only to meet the regional demand for methanol for marine transport and aviation but also for export to the rest of Denmark or beyond Danish borders.

While direct methods exist for some quantities like length, most physico-chemical properties require indirect assessment based on observable effects. Historically, pressure was measured by the water column height, and temperature by mercury expansion. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a transformative approach by combining vast datasets with traditional measurements. This holds immense potential for applications facing extreme conditions and involving complex fluids where measurement is extremely challenging (over 1500 K and 5 MPa). In this study, an AI model is evaluated to replace online rheometers (293–1173 K, 0.15–3.5 MPa). A machine learning model utilizes a neural network with up to 8000 neurons, eight hidden layers, and over 448 million parameters. Trained, tested, and validated on three experimental databases with over 600 test conditions, the New Generation Predicted Viscosity Sensor (NGPV sensor) achieves exceptional accuracy (less than 4.8 × 10−7 Pa·s). This virtualized sensor proves highly relevant for hypersonic airbreathing applications involving fuel degradation and energy conversion. It maintains excellent predictability (accuracy below 6 × 10−6 Pa·s) even at flow rates 10 times higher than calibration, surpassing traditional rheometers limited by calibration needs and a lower viscosity measurement threshold (10−4 Pa·s).

Traditional time-domain models are employed to evaluate the dynamic response of power system elements during transmission system faults. However, only the positive sequence components are considered for unbalanced faults, so the small-signal stability analysis is no longer accurate when assuming balanced conditions for asymmetrical faults. The dynamic phasor approach extends traditional models by representing synchronous machines with harmonic sequence components, making it suitable for an unbalanced condition analysis and revealing dynamic couplings not evident in conventional methods. By modeling electrical and mechanical equations with harmonic sequence components, the study implements an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis and participation factor analysis to identify the variable with significant participation in the critical modes and consequently in the dynamic response of synchronous machines during asymmetric faults, thereby control strategies can be proposed to improve system stability. The article validates the dynamic phasor model through simulations of a single-phase short circuit, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness in representing the transient and dynamic behavior of synchronous machines, and correctly identifies the harmonic sequence component with significant participation in the critical modes identified by the eigenvalue sensitivity to the rotor angular velocity and rotor angle.
