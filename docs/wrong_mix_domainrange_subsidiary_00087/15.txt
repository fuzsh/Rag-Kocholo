EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

TODAYâ€™S TECHNOLOGY GIVES financial managers the opportunity to create interactive, multidimensional reports. With the click of a few buttons, you can prepare up-to-date financial reports automatically.

IN ADDITION, THE REPORTS can provide drill-down functionality. Click on a number in the report, and the underlying support data appear.

THE MECHANISM APPLIES the PivotTable function of Microsoft Excel.

DATA ARE COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY from your accounting software database and imported into an Access database, where they are then brought into Excel.

THE BENEFITS OF SUCH A PROCESS ARE THAT

You can provide reports that are truly interactive.

Managers can open one report and see both the summary view and the detail behind any number in the report.

The report expands and collapses as the user desires.
