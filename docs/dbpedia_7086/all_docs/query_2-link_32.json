        "text": "Joan I (also known as Jeanne I and Juana I) (14 January 1273[1] – 31 March/2 April 1305),[2] the daughter of king Henry I of Navarre and Blanche of Artois, reigned as queen regnant of Navarre and also served as queen consort of France.\n\nLife[]\n\nJoan was born in Bar-sur-Seine on 14 January 1273. The following year 1274, upon the death of her father, she became Countess of Champagne and Queen regnant of Navarre. Her mother was her guardian and regent in Navarre. Various powers, both foreign and Navarrese, sought to take advantage of the minority of the heiress and the \"weakness\" of the female regent, which caused Joan and her mother to seek protection at the court of Philip III of France.\n\nAt the age of 10 (based on the date of birth above), Joan married the future Philip IV of France on 16 August 1284, becoming queen of France a year later. Their three surviving sons would all rule as kings of France, in turn, and their only surviving daughter, Isabella became queen consort of England. Queen Joan founded the famous College of Navarre in Paris.\n\nJoan was described as having been a plump, plain woman, whereas her beautiful daughter Isabella resembled her father more in physical appearance.[3] As regards her character, Joan was bold, courageous, and enterprising. She even led an army against the Count of Bar when he rebelled against her.\n\nJoan died in 1305, allegedly in childbirth, though one chronicler accused her husband of having killed her. Her personal physician was the inventor Guido da Vigevano.\n\nIssue[]\n\nWith Philip IV of France:\n\nMargaret (1288 – c. 1294)\n\nLouis X of France, King Louis I of Navarre from 1305, France from 1314 (October 1289 – 5 June 1316)\n\nBlanche (1290 – c. 1294)\n\nPhilip V of France and Navarre (as Philip II) (1292/93 – 3 January 1322)\n\nCharles IV of France and Navarre (as Charles I) (c. 1294 – 1 February 1328)\n\nIsabella (c. 1295 – 23 August 1358), married Edward II of England\n\nRobert (1297 – July 1308)\n\nAncestry[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nDoherty, P.C.
