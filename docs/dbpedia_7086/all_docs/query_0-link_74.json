        "meta_description": "This chapter discusses the Tour de Nesle affair of 1314, in which Philip IV accused his sons’ three wives of adultery and treason and had them imprisoned. The perceived ‘dangerous’ sexuality of these three women had a direct effect on the Capetian dynasty and, most notably, its end. This chapter pairs an examination of the alleged adultery with a close study of gendered inheritance in fourteenth-century France. Through these avenues of analysis, this chapter underscores the dangers of errant sexuality to queens in medieval France and how its consequences affected not only them but their children and the royal line.",
