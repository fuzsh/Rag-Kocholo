        "text": "Now back to the future Queen Isabella I of Castile.\n\nAt the time of Infanta Isabella’s birth, she was second in line to the throne after her older half-brother the future King Enrique IV of Castile. Enrique was 26 at that time and married, but childless at that time.\n\nHer father, King Juan II of Castile was King of Castile and León from 1406 to 1454, was therefore the reigning monarch when future Queen Isabella I of Castile was born. King Juan II died on July 20, 1454 in Valladolid at the age of 49 and his eldest son succeeded him as King Enrique IV of Castile and Léon. Young Infanta Isabella was three years old.\n\nInfanta Isabella’s younger brother, Infante Alfonso of Castile was born two years after her on November 17, 1453, demoting her position to third in line. When her father died Infanta Isabella and her brother Infante Alfonso were left in King Enrique IV’s care. Isabella, her mother, and Infante Alfonso then moved to Arévalo.\n\nKing Enrique IV had been married prior to becoming King and when he was Prince of Asturias.\n\nHis chosen bride was Blanche of Navarre and Aragon the daughter of King Juan II of Aragon and Queen Blanche I of Navarre. Blanche of Navarre was an elder sister of the future King Fernando II of Aragon, husband of Queen Isabella I of Castile.\n\nIn 1427, she, her brother Charles, and her sister Eleanor were proclaimed the rightful heirs of the kingdom of Navarre. Blanche was promised to the heir of Castile in the peace treaty between Navarre and Castile in 1436. She married Enrique, Prince of Asturias (later King Enrique IV of Castile) in 1440. The marriage was reputedly never consummated.\n\nIn 1453, after thirteen years, the year before Infante Enrique became King, he sought the annulment of the marriage. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche. A divorce was granted by Pope Nicholas V on the grounds that some “witchcraft” had prevented Enrique from consummating the marriage.\n\nAfter this, Blanche was sent home to Navarre, where she was imprisoned by her family: from 1462, she was under the custody of her sister. She remained childless throughout her life.\n\nAfter the death of her brother Charles in 1461, some dissatisfied Navarrese elements and some of the anti-Aragonese party regarded Blanche as the rightful monarch, as they had regarded her brother Charles. They proclaimed her queen. She would have thus become Queen Blanche II of Navarre, had not her father (who wanted to keep the government of Navarre) already had her incarcerated and thus not capable to act.\n\nShe died by poison in Orthez less than a month later.\n\nOne of Enrique’s detractors, the historian Alfonso de Palencia, wrote that the marriage had been a sham and accused Enrique of despising his wife and planning to commit adultery to bear children. According to Palencia, Enrique demonstrated “most extreme abhorrence” to his wife, and indifference to the confines of marriage."
