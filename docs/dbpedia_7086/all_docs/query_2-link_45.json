        "text": "The Treaty of Le Goulet you could just replace Blanche of Castile with Eleanor. The peace from the Treaty of Le Goulet only lasted two years in OTL, so I think whether there's the Treaty or not the fighting is going to keep going because in OTL basically the only lasting impact of the Treaty was the marriage, so you could still have that, just with Eleanor instead, while there is still hostility between France and England because the Treaty only lasted two years anyway\n\nBut they need to wait until Eleanor of Aquitaine is dead and the support of Innocent III and Berengaria before Philip II gains the custody of the daughter of Richard the Lionheart...\n\nShe can marry the Count of Provence or the Count of Toulouse, the second is impossible due to Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nProvence and Aragon have issues with the Count of Toulouse, so they have common interests.\n\nDid Eleanor really hate Toulouse?\n\nBecause was an idiocy who he should have not done OTL and ATL he will have no way to do it meaning who Isabella will marry directly Hugh X of Lusignan as originally planned, keeping the situation in Aquitaine under control.\n\nEleanor II will NOT inherit the majority of her grandfather‘s continental lands (who are Normandy, Anjou and Maine) but she will get only her grandmother’s inheritance and possibly Maine from the Angevin lands.\n\nFerdinand and Isabella lived CENTURIES after the POD and Aragon then was still a powerful state, with all his decline and wars of successions.\n\nIn any case Eleanor of Aquitaine will NOT accept a French prince or the heir of Toulouse for her granddaughter, she can not marry in Navarre, Brittany or Champagne as they are all too close relatives and she need to marry someone with lands around the sourthern part of France so Aragorn is a good option, maybe an heir of Provence could be an alternative but I can not think to nobody else\n\nWhat would be the wider political consequences of the partition of the Angevin Empire between Arthur in England, Normandy and Brittany and Eleanor in Aquitaine, Maine and Anjou? Like Charles V in 1556, the critical mass of the Angevin Empire had just dissipated here.\n\nWould Philip take this a step further and try to get Eleanor married to Louis? That would be really interesting because even if Eleanor doesn't come to the throne at the death of Richard, there's a claim. In OTL, Louis came very close to winning the First Baron's War until John died and the people helping Louis win defected to the side of Henry, John's son. If Louis has a claim to the Kingdom of England (even a tenuous one) as Richard's son-in-law, does he still lose support upon the death of John, as in OTL?\n\nInterestingly, had Louis won, England would merely be an extension of France today.\n\nThat is if Berengaria and Innocent III supports Philip II and if there is no Treaty of Goulet or equivalent where Eleanor of Brittany or Blanche of Castile marries Louis VIII.\n\nI think Berengaria would support her son-in-law in this case.\n\nThe Treaty of Le Goulet you could just replace Blanche of Castile with Eleanor. The peace from the Treaty of Le Goulet only lasted two years in OTL, so I think whether there's the Treaty or not the fighting is going to keep going because in OTL basically the only lasting impact of the Treaty was the marriage, so you could still have that, just with Eleanor instead, while there is still hostility between France and England because the Treaty only lasted two years anyway\n\nEleanor, the largest landowner in France at this point, would be a far greater bride than Eleanor, who has no chance of becoming Queen of Castile like Urraca or Isabella.\n\nThe partition would be\n\nJohn - England and Normandy\n\nArthur - Anjou, Maine, and Tourraine\n\nEleanor II - Aquitaine\n\nIf Eleanor is born around Richard's death or after, the heir to the Count of Provence would be the perfect candidate for her to marry to secure an alliance with Aragon and it will also secure her potential inheritance of Navarre while John can marry Alice, Count of Eu, but he had already overlooked that opportunity, Alice of Eu is a descendant of William of Sully, another bride would be Maria of Brabant, the fiancé of his nephew Otto, it secures the bloodline of Stephen of England and possibly they can inherit Boulogne if Matilda of Boulogne dies without heirs.\n\nEleanor of Brittany is less of a threat to John so he can marry her to Louis VIII but if Arthur still dies as OTL, Anjou, Maine, and Tourraine go to the Royal domain.\n\nHer claims would be invalidated by the Treaty of Le Goulet to prevent a marriage between Eleanor and Louis VIII.\n\nI don’t see Richard signing any treaties that would disavow the claims of his daughter. I see him doing everything possible to buff up the claims of his daughter. Actually make barons swear allegiance to his daughter in his lifetime, get folks like Will Marshal and Eleanor of Aquitaine to be the regent etc. What would be the point of doing all this? To benefit fucken JOHN?!\n\nNot Richard, but John and Eleanor.\n\nWhy would Eleanor sign any treaties like that? She’s not even of age, and barons would fight for her over John because it’s fucken John. His position instantly collapsed as soon as his bro returned. Even when he was away, John had trouble causing trouble without the barons putting him down. If Eleanor of Aquitaine was the one signing it, WTF would she sign something like this? Richard was her favourite son. I’d imagine her favour would carry on to Eleanor Junior.\n\nWhy would Eleanor sign any treaties like that?
