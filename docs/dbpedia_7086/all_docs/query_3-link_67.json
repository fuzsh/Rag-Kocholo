        "text": "All my genealogy info is buried under a pile of paperwork - so will have to dig out and dust off. Though recently purchased a book on Capetian France - so will dig that one out also.\n\nHouse of Blois - still around in the mid-17th Century though merged with the ducal House of Orleans before being taken over by the French Crown.\n\nHouse of Champagne - merged with the crowns of France and Navarre under Charles (IV of France and I of Navarre).\n\nSo a merging with the French Crown under the male line definitely but with regards to the English Crown - this would need further investigation\n\nThere is a very well known descent from Marie of France. Countess of Champagne.\n\nEnglish king Edward III claimed the French throne through his mother Isabella the daughter of French King Philip IV and Queen Joan I of Navarre the daughter of King Henry I the son of King Theobald I of Navarre & Count of Champagne son of Count Theobald III of Champagne son of Count Henry I and Marie of France, daughter of Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nTheobald V, Count of Blois, and his wife Alix of France had, among other children, 2 daughters, Margaret and Isabelle, who married and had descendants.\n\nDiana Spencer, Princess of Wales, was daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, son of .... Cynthia Hamilton, daughter of .... Rosalind Bingham, daughter of .... Cecilia Gordon-Lennox, daughter of Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond, son of the 4th duke of Richmond, son of Lord George Lennox, son of the 2nd Duke of Richmond, son of Charles Lennox the first Duke of Richmond and illegitimate son of King Charles II of England, France, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nKing Charles II was the son of Henrietta Maria, daughter of Marie de' Medici, daughter of Joanna of Austria, daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I, son of King Philip the Handsome, son of Emperor Maximilian I and Duchess Mary of Burgundy, daughter of Duke Charles the Rash, son of Duke Philip the Good, son of Duke John the fearless, son of Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, Artois, and Burgundy (1350-1405).\n\nMargaret III, Countess of Flanders, Artois, and Burgundy (1350-1405) was the daughter of Count Louis II of Flanders, son of Margaret I, Countess of Burgundy, daughter of King Philip V of France (himself a descendant of Marie of France) and his wife Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, daughter of Otto IV, Count of Burgundy, son of Adelaide, Countess of Burgundy, daughter of Beatrice II of Hohenstauffen, Countess of Burgundy, daughter of Margaret of Blois (died 1230) daughter of Theobald V of Blois and Alix of France, daughter of Louis VIII and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nHere is a shorter line to Alix of France:\n\nElizabeth of York (1466-1503) wife of Henry VII, daughter of King Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, daughter of Jacquetta of Luxemburg, daughter of Peter of Luxemburg, Count of Saint-Pol, son of John of Luxemburg, Lord of Beauvior, Son of Guy I of Luxemburg and Mahaut of Chatillon, Countess of Saint-Pol, daughter of John, Count of Saint-Pol, son of Guy IV, Count of Saint-Pol, son of Guy III of Chatillon, Count of Saint-Pol, son of Mary of Avesnes, Countess of Blois, daughter of Margaret of Blois (died 1230) daughter of Theobald V of Blois and Alix of France, daughter of Louis VIII and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nThank you - that is most interesting.\n\nit is, isn't it - i rather thought that the line of decent from the two Daughters had either just petered out or had sunk further and further into the obscurity of the minor French aristocracy...\n\ni wonder if, when the individuals who were decended of the two duaghters came to the throne - or the marriages were proposed - anything was made of their decent from Eleanor and her role in the founding of the Plantagent empire and dynasty?\n\nlike a more extended version of the Tudor-York marriage being the coming together of sundered claims?\n\nthanks to MAGolding for the work thats been done on this, its most illuminating...\n\nI previously wrote that:\n\nKing Henry VII, son of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, Son of Owen Tudor and Catharine of France, daughter of king Charles VI of France, son of Jeanne of Bourbon, daughter of Isabelle of Valois, daughter of Mahaut of Chatillon, daughter of Guy IV of Chatillion, Count of Saint-Pol, son of Guy III, son of Marie, Countess of Blois, daughter of Margaret of Blois(died 1230) daughter of Theobald V, Count of Blois, and Alix daughter of Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nIt turns out King Henry VII of England was also descended from Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, the other daughter of Eleanor & Louis VII.\n\nKing Henry VII, son of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, Son of Owen Tudor and Catherine of France, daughter of King Charles VI of France, son of Jeanne of Bourbon, Daughter of Duke Peter I of Bourbon, son of Mary of Avesnes, daughter of Count John II of Holland, son of John of Avesnes, Count of Holland, son of Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, daughter of Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople and Marie of Champagne, daughter of Marie of France, daughter of king Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine."
