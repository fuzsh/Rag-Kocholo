        "text": "On 19 Oct 1216 [her former brother-in-law] King John \"Lackland\" of England (age 49) died at Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire [Map]. His son King Henry III of England (age 9) succeeded III King England.\n\nJohn Monmouth (age 34) was present.\n\nOn his deathbed, John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal 1st Earl Pembroke (age 70).\n\nKing John's will is the earliest English royal will to survive in its original form. The document is quite small, roughly the size of a postcard and the seals of those who were present at the time would have been attached to it. Translation of the will taken from an article by Professor S.D. Church in the English Historical Review, June 2010:\n\nI, John, by the grace of God king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, count of Anjou, hindered by grave infirmity and not being able at this time of my infirmity to itemize all my things so that I may make a testament, commit the arbitration and administration of my testament to the trust and to the legitimate administration of my faithful men whose names are written below, without whose counsel, even in good health, I would have by no means arranged my testament in their presence, so that what they will faithfully arrange and determine concerning my things as much as in making satisfaction to God and to holy Church for damages and injuries done to them as in sending succour to the land of Jerusalem and in providing support to my sons towards obtaining and defending their inheritance and in making reward to those who have served us faithfully and in making distribution to the poor and to religious houses for the salvation of my soul, be right and sure. I ask, furthermore, that whoever shall give them counsel and assistance in the arranging of my testament shall receive the grace and favour of God. Whoever shall infringe their arrangement and disposition, may he incur the curse and indignation of almighty God and the blessed Mary and all the saints.\n\nIn the first place, therefore, I desire that my body be buried in the church of St Mary and St Wulfstan at Worcester. I appoint, moreover, the following arbiters and administrators: the lord Guala, by the grace of God, cardinal-priest of the title of St Martin and legate of the apostolic see; the lord Peter bishop of Winchester; the lord Richard bishop of Chichester; the lord Silvester bishop of Worcester; Brother Aimery de St-Maur; William Marshal earl of Pembroke; Ranulf earl of Chester; William earl Ferrers; William Brewer; Walter de Lacy and John of Monmouth; Savaric de Mauléon; Falkes de Bréauté.\n\nThe signatories were:\n\nGuala Bicchieri (ca 1150 - 1227) Papal Legate.\n\nBishop Peter de Roches, Bishop of Winchester.\n\nRichard le Poer (? - 1237), Bishop of Chichester.\n\nSylvester of Worcester, Bishop of Worcester.\n\nAimery de St-Maur (? -?1219), Master of the English Templars.\n\nWilliam Marshal 1st Earl Pembroke (age 70).\n\nRanulf de Blondeville Gernon 6th Earl Chester 1st Earl Lincoln (age 46).\n\nWilliam Ferrers 4th Earl of Derby (age 48).\n\nWilliam Brewer (? - 1226), 1st Baron Brewer.\n\nWalter de Lacy (ca 1172-1241) Lord of Meath.\n\nJohn: (1182 - 1248) Lord of Monmouth.\n\nSavaric de Mauléon (? - 1236) Seneschal of Poitou from 1205.\n\nFalkes de Bréauté (? - 1226) Seneschal of Cardiff Castle.\n\nGeorgian Memoirs. The first number of Mr. Stothard's work was received with the applause it merited, and obtained for him distinguished reputation, both as an artist and an antiquary. His time was now occupied in making various excursions in search of monumental antiquities; and, during the summer of 1815, he proceeded as far northward as the Picts' Wall, in order to make drawings for Lyson's Magna Britannia. In the same year, he was appointed historical draughtsman to the Society of Antiquaries; and, in 1816, he was deputed by that body to commence his elaborate and faithful drawings from the celebrated tapestry preserved at Bayeux, in France. He left England, for that purpose, in September; and, after having visited Paris, proceeded, upon a tour of investigation, to Chinon, and discovered, in the adjacent abbey of Fontevraud [Map], those interesting effigies of the Plantagenet race, the existence of which, after the Revolution, had become matter of doubt. He found the abbey converted into a prison; and, in a cellar belonging to it, were deposited the effigies of Henry the Second, his queen, [her former mother-in-law] Eleanor of Guienne, [her former husband] Richard the First, and Isabella of Angouleme, the queen of [her former brother-in-law] John. The chapel, in which these figures were placed, previously to the Revolution, had been destroyed; and, since their removal to the cellar, they were exposed to continual injury from the prisoners, who came there, twice a day, to draw water at the well. From these effigies Mr. Stothard made several accurate and beautiful drawings; and succeeded, after much labour and difficulty, in discovering the painting upon their surface. Whilst upon a visit to the abbey of L'Espan, near Mons, which he found converted into a barn, he discovered, under a quantity of wheat, the effigy of Berengaria, queen of Richard the First. At Mons, he also discovered the beautiful enamelled tablet of Geoffrey Plantagenet, which he considered the earliest specimen of what is termed a sepulchral brass, and of armorial bearings, depicted decidedly as such.\n\nEffigy of Queen Berengaria. This Princess was the queen of Richard I., and daughter of Sancho, king of Navarre. It does not appear that she was ever in England, a circumstance not surprising, when those events of her life known are considered, and that Richard himself did not, altogether, pass more than eight months in his English possessions. Berengaria is first spoken of as being brought to king Richard by his mother Eleanor de Guienne, at Messina, when on his way to the Holy Land. She was afterwards married to him, and crowned by the bishop of Evreux in the island of Cyprus. From thence in company with Joan, the sister of Richard, she proceeded to share with her husband the fatigues and perils of the Crusade: on her return to Europe, sailing a few days before the king, she avoided the captivity into which he subsequently fell, and retired to Poitiers. No more of her is known till after the death of Richard Coeur de Lion, when on claiming her dower of King John at Chinon in 1201, it appears she was so little recognized as the queen of Richard, that it was not till after the testimony of the validity of her marriage, by those that were present at its celebration, that John would satisfy her demand. Henry III., in the 4th of his reign, 1219, compounded with her in lieu of her dower. The time of her death is uncertain; she was buried in the abbey of L'Espan, which she had founded. Berengaria was celebrated as well for her eloquence as her beauty; but Richard has been charged by some historians with having neglected her.\n\nConsidering that amidst the havoc of monumental sculpture in France, the Royal Effigies at Fontevraud have escaped destruction, it becomes still more remarkable, that the same good fortune should have also attended this effigy, the last erection in France commemorative of Royalty which belonged to the English monarchy. Although the tomb was overlooked in the heat of Revolutionary Vandalism, yet has it ultimately suffered from the suppression of religious houses. On visiting the abbey of L'Espan in 1816, near Mans, which contains this tomb, the church was found in a ruinous state, and had been applied to the purposes of a barn. The architectural parts of Queen Berengaria's tomb were discovered lying about the place, but the effigy was concealed beneath a considerable quantity of wheat. After many difficulties, and the delay of a twelvemonth, it was uncovered, and found placed upright in a niche, in excellent preservation, with the exception that the whole of the left arm was wanting. By the effigy were lying the bones of the Queen, the silent witnesses of the sacrilegious, as well as recent demolition of the tomb. After some search, a great portion of the arm belonging to the statue was recovered, but the remainder could no where be found. As the destruction of this tomb had been the work of no very distant period, it was deemed interesting to seek the testimony of those engaged in it, relative to what besides the bones had been discovered within the tomb. Three men, who had assisted in this work of destruction, stated, that the monument with the figure upon it, stood in the centre of the aisle at the east end of the church; that there was no cothn found within it, but a small square box, containing bones, pieces of linen, some stuff embroidered with gold, and a slate, on which was an inscription. The slate alluded to in this statement, was found in the possession of a canon of the church of St. Julien, at Mans; upon it was engraven the inscription following, which accounts for the interior state of the tomb.\n\nMausoleum Istud Serenissime Berengariae Anglorum Reginae liujus Coenobii Fundatricis Inclitae restauratuni et in augustiorem locum hunc translatum fuit in eoq: recondita sunt Ossa haee quae reperta fuerunt in Antiquo tumulo die 27 Maii Anno Domini 1672.\n\n[This Tomb of the most serene Berengaria,, Queen of the Angies, the noble Founder of this Monastery, was restored and removed to this more sacred place. In it were again deposited the bones which yere found in the ancient sepulchre, on the 27th day of May, in the year of our Lord 1672]\n\nOf the original situation of the tomb we must remain ignorant, but there can be no doubt whatever, from the style of the architecture and sculpture, that it is of the same date as the effigy, which may be placed towards the commencement of the thirteenth century. As St. Julien, the principal church at Mans, is about to be restored as nearly as possible to the same state it was in before the Revolution, it has been suggested to those superintending so praiseworthy a work, to remove and place the monument of Berengaria in that church; and it appears probable that this will be done.\n\nThe sides of the tomb are ornamented with deep quatrefoils. The effigy which was upon it is in high relief It represents the Queen with her hair unconfined, but partly concealed by the coverchief over which is placed an elegant crown. Her mantle is fastened by a narrow band crossing her breast; a large fermail or broach, richly set with stones, confines her tunic at the neck. To an ornamented girdle which encircles her waist, is attached a small aulmoniere, or purse, to contain alms. The Queen holds in her hands a book, singular from the circumstance of having embossed on the cover a second representation of herself as lying on a bier, with waxen torches burning in candlesticks by her side. This effigy, among many others, is an instance of the incorrectness of the prints in Montfaucon's work on the Monuments of the French Monarchy. There is a representation, professed to have been from this effigy, in which the book is entirely left out, and the position of the arms altered; that such unwarrantable liberties were taken, is now the more to be lamented, as the greater part of the originals in Montfaucon's collection no longer exist.\n\nDetails—Fig. 1.
