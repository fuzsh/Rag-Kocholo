        "text": "A Royal Massacre/Capture at Poitiers, AKA the Three Dauphins Remain\n\nSince starting my account a few weeks I have, in between school and course work, thinking of what to write first. My main idea has been a timeline involving a POD with an altered Battle of Poitiers in which the Dauphins Charles (OTL Charles V) and Louis, and John (of Berry), as well as the...\n\nViability of a Spanish march/province on southern France\n\nGreetings, albeit being a longtime lurker on this forum, this is my first post.

Charles, however, dies soon after as OTL. So here are a...\n\nWI: Joan II of Navarre became Queen of France?\n\nIn 1314 a scandal known as the Tour de Nestle affair happened and the daughters-in-law of Philip IV were accused of adultery which would lead to women not being trusted on the French Throne.

But what if these two do NOT marry in the first place? Let's say Charles IX and Catherine de Medici renounce to the controversial idea of this marriage. What...\n\nWhat if Otto IV of HRE inherits Aquitaine and marries Blanche of Navarre\n\nI am actually doing a timeline where Otto IV has both HRE and Aquitaine as the successor of Richard I in Aquitaine, how would it affect the Angevin Empire as a whole if he becomes the ruler of Aquitaine and marries Blanche of Navarre, how would this affect John II's reign as the King of England...\n\nA different Angevin division\n\nThreadmarks: Different division\n\nOtto of Brunswick would be chosen to inherit Aquitaine on Richard I’s death without issue on 1199 and he would marry Blanche of Navarre to continue the alliance of Navarre and Aquitaine on July 1199 which would confirm him as the heir to Aquitaine despite being the anti-king of Germany, the...\n\nHenry IV of Castile is capable monarch\n\nLets say, that ATL Henry IV happens to be opposite of his OTL version: he is strong and capable monarch (caplable also to provide his kingdom with legitimate heir), how is situation in Iberian Peninsula affected? Would Carlos of Viana survive as result? If John of Aragon tries to remove him...\n\nHenry IV has children with Joan of Navarre\n\nSo what are the repercussions if Henry IV of England had sons and/or daughters with his second wife Joan of Navarre, dowager Duchess of Brittany?\n\nTheobald III of Navarre\n\nTheobald, son of Henry of Navarre, died in unfortunate accident as small kid. What if he survived to adulthood? French-Navarrese union is certainly avoided, but what other changes should we expdect? Is Philip IV still marries Joan of Navarre if she is not heiress of the kingdom? And Navarre...\n\nEarlier Bourbon Navarre\n\nThrough marriage of Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne d'Albret House of Bourbon inherited throne of Navarre, but Bourbon succession in Navarre could happen much earlier and on better conditions (IOTL by the time Bourbons took over Navarre was reducedvto areas north of Pyrenees). POD is: Blanche I of...\n\nAHC: Charles the Bad murders his way to the throne of France\n\nThe challenge is to set Charles II, King of the small realm of Navarre on the throne of France. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre Charles was a member of the House of Capet-Èvreux on his fathers side, the seniormost line of Capet after the Valois and was through his mother...\n\nWI: Aragon and Navarre stay together?\n\nIOTL, the kingdoms of Aragon, Navarre, and the County of Barcelona were for a time united under a single monarch between the late 1050's and the death of the heirless Alfonso I (\"the Battler\") in 1134, after which Alfonso's own absurd will (which would have left the country to three Knightly...\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon has legitimate issue\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragon had no children with his wife, Maria of Castile. Upon his death he was succeeded by younger brother in Aragon and by illegitimate son in Naples.
