I recognize their contributions here, knowing that this book stands as the final product of their innumerable acts of generosity and kindness. The project would not have been possible without the support of my friends and colleagues in the Art History Department at Drew University, Margaret Kuntz and Kimberly Rhodes. Sonja Sekely-Rowland and Şan Solu provided valuable assistance with image editing. Drew University contributed a semester-long sabbatical, a one-semester course release, several research grants for trips to France, and funds for copyediting. A generous publication grant from the Kress Foundation in conjunction with the International Center of Medieval Art substantially offset the publication costs of the book. My colleagues in the Interlibrary Loan office at Drew, Kathleen Juliano and Madeline Nitti-Bontempo, obtained innumerable obscure volumes and images from libraries all over the country during the six years I worked on this project. I am most grateful to all these individuals and institutions.

I owe a special debt of gratitude to Joan Holladay, who has been a kind mentor and friend from the beginning of the project. Peggy Brown’s generosity with her unparalleled knowledge of 14th-century French archival sources has made her an invaluable help to me and to this project. S.C. Kaplan vetted my English translation of the testament of Blanche of Navarre, and Maura Heyn assisted with Latin translations. The anonymous external reviewer engaged by Brill furnished me with a detailed critique, thereby contributing to the strength of the analysis in the book. Series editors Sarah Blick and Laura Gelfand offered useful suggestions and feedback throughout the process. I also thank my Brill editor, Marcella Mulder, for her guidance, and my copy editor, Sharon Herson, for her thoughtful and careful work on the text.

I have included only the bequests relevant to objects in this book, about half the total number. In the case of other wills or inventories used for comparison (those of Jeanne of Evreux or Blanche of Orléans, for example), the English translation appears in the text and the original French in a footnote. In scholarship written in English on 14th-century France, the use of names for individuals varies, for example, Jean, duc de Berry, or John, duke of Berry. Whenever possible I have used the English version of names, except when it would deviate too much from accepted usage (so John II, king of France, but Jeanne of Evreux, not Joan of Evreux). * The translation of Blanche’s will into English is my own; I am grateful to S.C. Kaplan for reviewing it and discussing it with me. All errors are my own.\n\nxii\n\nNotes On Translation, Citation, And Names\n\nIntroduction Introduction\n\n1\n\nIntroduction In her testament of 1396, Blanche of Navarre (1331–98) wrote about a diamond that her late husband, the French king Philip VI (r. 1328–50), had greatly loved; noted that she wanted to give a set of bedclothes that she used for women in labor in her household to her niece (a future queen of England); said that her book, now more than 150 years old, which had once been owned by Saint Louis and returned to him by an angel, should be given to her nephew, Charles III, king of Navarre; and made known that the reliquary belt for protection in battle of her late husband (a belt that presumably had been put away in the 46 years since Philip’s death, unless it was efficacious for more than just battle) was intended for the present king of France, Charles VI.1 The object collection of Blanche of Navarre, in other words, is an irresistible topic for further research. Blanche herself made her objects irresistible through these testamentary descriptions; she wanted her heirs to cherish her gifts, and by extension, her memory. Blanche, like so many of her contemporaries, used cultural patronage for spiritual benefit, to exercise power, maintain and display status, and bolster family relationships. This book, however, is atypical as a patronage study because the extant evidence of her possessions includes her remarkable testament and codicils. In what follows, I consider Blanche’s commissions of funerary monuments for herself and her daughter at Saint-Denis, and for her parents at the church of the Jacobins, as well as scattered other commissions, along with the usual kinds of information employed to elucidate patronage, such as surviving works of art, household accounts, and other payment records. Blanche’s testament does not provide the kind of evidence that typically illuminates patronage, like the cost of items or the names of the artists who were hired to create works of art; nevertheless, it conveys a great deal of information. Blanche draws connections between people and between persons and things that she intended to be meaningful, so that we see what she thought was 1 Following the example of other scholars, I use the terms ‘testament’ and ‘will’ interchangeably in this book. For discussion of these terms, see Clive Burgess, “Late Medieval Wills and Pious Convention: Testamentary Evidence Reconsidered,” in Profit, Piety, and the Professions in Later Medieval England, ed. Michael Hicks (Gloucester, 1990), pp. 14–33, esp. p. 30; and Anne M. Dutton, “Passing the Book: Testamentary Transmission of Religious Literature to and by Women in England, 1350–1500,” in Women, the Book and the Godly: Selected Proceedings of the St. Hilda’s Conference, 1993, ed. Lesley Smith and Jane Taylor (Woodbridge, UK, 1995), vol. 1, pp. 41–54, esp. p. 41, n. 2.\n\n© Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016 | doi 10.1163/9789004318830_002\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nimportant, as well as what she valued about her possessions. The testament also tells us about her aesthetic choices and what she appreciated about her objects, revealing the accoutrements of a dowager queen’s household in the 14th century, from her bedding to her kitchen to her chapel. In this study about objects and relationships between people, it seems appropriate to begin with a story about a wedding, a ceremony marking status and transition that also calls for gifts of objects and the celebration of old and new family ties. The wedding was that of Jeanne, the only child of Blanche and Philip VI; her intended spouse was John, son of the king of Aragon. The archival material on which we depend to reconstruct the wedding events is from the payment records kept by King Charles V (1332–80), grandson of Philip VI; out of obligation or affection, he paid for at least some of the expenses of the wedding of this French princess. From these payment records we learn that the 20-year-old Jeanne set out on her journey to Perpignan, the wedding site in July or August 1371, accompanied by an entourage that included the countess of Porcien, Jacqueline de Dammartin, the bishop of Auxerre, Pierre Aymé, and a knight, Philippe de Villiers.2 Just prior to her departure, in June 1371, Charles V gave Jeanne 200 francs to distribute on visits (pélerinages) to churches in Paris and to Saint-Denis.3 At Saint-Denis she would have visited her father’s grave as well as the tombs of her Capetian ancestors; the visits to other churches in Paris enabled her to marshal the spiritual aid of the clergy, the patron saints, and the relics of the churches of her native city before she embarked upon her life in Aragon. By mid-August, Jeanne and her companions were in southern France; a chronicler recorded her entry into Montpellier on 23 August and her departure six days later.4 Subsequently, her entourage was delayed at Béziers, 95 kilometers north of Perpignan, because Jeanne had fallen ill. She would die in Béziers on 16 September 1371, and her body was taken to the cathedral of Saint-Nazaire\n\n2 The exact date of her departure is not known. Pierre Aymé was paid 300 francs for each month of the trip by order of 25 June 1371; see Mandements et actes divers de Charles V, ed. Léopold Delisle (Paris, 1874), p. 404. On 2 July 1371, Charles V paid the knight Philippe de Villiers 400 francs for the expenses of accompanying her; Mandements de Charles V, p. 407. On the details of this trip and the participation of Jacqueline de Dammartin, see Roland Delachenal, Histoire de Charles V, 5 vols. (Paris, 1909–31), 4:389–90. 3 Mandements de Charles V, p. 403. 4 Thalamus parvus. Le petit thalamus de Montpellier, ed. La Société Archéologique de Montpellier (Montpellier, 1841), p. 386.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthere.5 Sometime in the fall of 1371, Jeanne’s body was transported to Paris for burial at the abbey church of Saint-Denis, where her mother furnished a chapel for Jeanne and herself among her Capetian ancestors (see chap. 1 below). Despite having moved her daughter’s body to Paris, Blanche of Navarre commissioned a tomb or a memorial for her at Saint-Nazaire in Béziers.6 This memorial monument was destroyed in 1562; its presence in the church nearly 200 years later despite the transfer of Jeanne’s remains to Saint-Denis suggests that a part of her body may have been left at Saint-Nazaire for burial, perhaps her entrails.7 The commission of a tomb or a memorial in Béziers might seem odd, considering this distant town had no other evident familial or devotional significance for Blanche. But once her daughter had died there, it seems that the church of Saint-Nazaire became part of the biography of Blanche and her daughter; she commemorated its significance in her life and the memory of her daughter through a visual marker of her daughter’s passing there. This practice is reminiscent of Jeanne’s pilgrimages to the churches of Paris to distribute money; by her patronage, funded by Charles V, Jeanne had demonstrated her change in status and identity, from a French princess to a new bride and a future queen of Aragon. At some point in their journey, the entourage of Jeanne of France ran into financial difficulties, likely a result of the funds expended on the unexpected stay at Béziers, and some of the bride’s wedding gifts had to be pawned. The unlucky travelers have left a serendipitous record, however, because some of the pawned gifts are described in an April 1372 act by King Charles V, who wanted to retrieve them.8 They included a large silver-gilt nef (an elaborate metal table vessel in the form of a ship) from Jeanne’s half-brother, Philip, duke of Orléans, as well as a set of silver tableware that included four cups, four ewers, two large basins for spices, and a silver-gilt vessel for alms. This set is 5 Thalamus parvus. Le petit thalamus de Montpellier, p. 386. Blanche left money to Saint-Nazaire in her will, indicating it was the church in which her daughter had initially been buried; Léopold Delisle, “Testament de Blanche de Navarre, reine de France,” Mémoires de la Société de l’histoire de Paris et de l’Ile de France 12 (1885), 1–64, no. 527. 6 The tomb memorial was destroyed on 6 May 1562; Claude de Vic and Joseph Vaissete, Histoire générale de Languedoc, avec des notes et les pièces justificatives, 5 vols. (Toulouse, 1872), 4:271. 7 Étienne Sabatier called it an entrails tomb and said it was supported by columns with fleurde-lis; Histoire de la ville et des évêques de Béziers (Paris, 1854), p. 336. For the practice of dividing the body at burial, see Elizabeth A.R. Brown, “Death and the Human Body in the Later Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the Division of the Corpse,” Viator 12 (1981), 221–70. 8 Mandements de Charles V, pp. 453–54.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ndescribed as a gift from the pope, Gregory XI, at this time resident himself in Avignon. These goods were pledged for 1,000 francs, which Charles V had already repaid at the writing of the June 1372 document, and he wanted the objects returned to Blanche of Navarre. The documentary traces of this ill-fated wedding voyage reveal the kind of gift, silver tableware, that might be expected for a royal wedding in the 14th century. The records also demonstrate that the pope was generous in his gifts to the French princess because his silver items were among those valuable enough to be pawned. We discover that Charles V worked to ensure that Jeanne’s wedding gifts were returned to her mother, probably at Blanche’s request. That the objects themselves were to be returned, not just financial remuneration for them, is an indication that the objects had value beyond the monetary, whether emotional, because they were a deceased daughter’s possessions, or symbolic, because of the elevated status of those who gave, such as the pope. Another important point should be highlighted in this narrative. None of these works survives, neither the Béziers tomb nor any of the tableware; we know about them only through written descriptions. If pieces of the silver survive in a museum or private collection, they are not still associated with the name of Jeanne of France or Blanche of Navarre. A reconstruction of Blanche’s collection from documentary evidence like the records of Charles V, or from the evidence of her testament, adds these objects to the history of art even if they do not exist in physical form. Blanche of Navarre was an important figure of her era at the French court, a dowager queen, an advisor to the kings of France, and to her brother, Charles II (1332–87), king of Navarre, and a mediator in times of crisis during the Hundred Years War, though histories of the 14th century in France have mostly neglected her life. She was born in 1331, married to Philip VI at 18 in 1350, and a widow seven months later. She was pregnant at her husband’s death and her daughter Jeanne was born in May 1351. She lived in and near Paris with her daughter and a community of women that variously included her sister Jeanne of Rohan, her aunt Jeanne of Evreux, as well as the wife of her brother Charles, another Jeanne. Her oldest brother is known to history as Charles the Bad because of his attempts in the 1350s and 1360s to unseat the French kings. These crises and Blanche’s role in resolving them are described more fully in the first chapter. Since there is so much surviving documentary evidence about Blanche of Navarre, it would be possible to write a fairly complete biography; for this project, however, I am interested in her biography as it intersects with her patronage and her possessions.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nAs a widow with substantial land holdings, Blanche had the resources to commission works of art that are associated only with her, not with a husband whose motivations and interests might obscure those of his wife. Of the hundreds of works of art that must have passed through Blanche’s hands or been commissioned by her, only a small number survive, and a handful more are known through later copies. These works are illustrated in the chapters that follow. The Saint-Denis tomb sculptures are kept today in the chapel she founded at Saint-Denis (Fig. 1.2), and the documents founding this chapel with their historiated initials showing Blanche and her family are in the Archives nationales in Paris (Figs. 1.1, 1.3). Two funerary monuments surviving only in fragmentary form are the heart tombs of Blanche’s parents that were sculpted for the church of the Jacobins in Paris; only the heads are extant (Figs. 1.13, 1.14). Of Blanche’s many textiles, a single vestment in the collection of the treasury of the cathedral of Sens is still associated with her (Figs. 6.1–6.3). The stainedglass windows that she may have commissioned for the cathedral of Evreux are also still in situ.9 One manuscript that passed through her collection survives: the psalter of Saint Louis today in the library of Leiden University in the Netherlands (Fig. 3.3). The Somme le roi manuscript of Philip the Fair in the British Library may also have been in Blanche’s collection (Fig. 3.5). Some of Blanche’s commissions survive in reproductions made for French antiquarians in the 17th and 18th centuries: François Roger de Gaignières commissioned copies of the tomb and paintings in her chapel at Saint-Denis and the heart tomb for her husband Philip VI from the church of the Jacobins (Figs. 1.4, 1.9–1.10, 1.12); Aubin-Louis Millin reproduced a reliquary that Blanche commissioned for the church of Vernon showing herself with the Virgin Mary (Fig. 4.5);10 Gaignières also had a copy made of a no-longer-extant painting in the chapel of Saint Michel in the Palais de la Cité in which Blanche is shown kneeling across from her husband (Fig. 1.11); I argue below that it seems unlikely that she commissioned this work. Another image that represents Blanche, not commissioned by her, is in the Grandes chroniques of Charles V; Blanche is shown with Jeanne of Evreux facilitating a reconciliation between her brother Charles of Navarre and King Charles V. In this book, I consider this corpus of works as well as\n\n9 10\n\nFor the windows, see below, chap. 1, n. 114.

The most important evidence about Blanche’s life and object ownership comes from her testament and codicils of 1396 and 1398 in which she described her possessions in detail.11 In chapter 2, I emphasize the importance of the testaments not just for their contents, but also as a genre of discourse. In other words, Blanche’s testament, though primarily a legal document, might also serve as a historical source, as an inventory of a queen’s collection, and ultimately, as a kind of autobiography.12 To give a picture of patronage, a scholar typically must assemble all the archival records related to works of art owned by the patron and then interpret them for intention, but in her testament Blanche herself gave this summary of what she thought of her collection at a particular time in her life. Katherine Lewis has written about testaments as autobiographical compositions, noting their importance particularly considering the relatively sparse documentation left by women.13 One of the goals of autobiography was to establish posthumous reputation; and, indeed, throughout Blanche’s testament she indicated her interest in being remembered fondly by the recipients of her possessions.14 Like an autobiographical narrative, the details of Blanche’s testament corroborate those of her life known through other evidence, such as her close relationship with Pierre Basin, her confessor. The archival record shows that he was acting on her behalf (with regard to the testament of her brother, Philip) as early as March 1364. That he was still in her service at the end of her life is one indicator of their close relationship; another is the intimacy of the gifts she left him, such as a reliquary statuette of Saint Catherine that she kept by her bed (analyzed further in chap. 4).15 11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14 15\n\nThe surviving wills from 1396 and 1398 are in Pau, Archives départementales des Pyrénées-Atlantiques, E 525. They were published by Léopold Delisle, “Testament de Blanche de Navarre,” pp. 1–64. Blanche probably made other wills that do not survive; I consider this question in chapter 2. A model for the use of wills and other legal documents to understand social history and gender roles is Martha Howell’s The Marriage Exchange: Property, Social Place, and Gender in Cities of the Low Countries, 1300–1550 (Chicago, 1998). Katherine Lewis, “Female Life-writing and the Testamentary Discourse: Women and Their Wills in Later Medieval England,” in Medieval Women and the Law, ed. Noël James Menuge (Woodbridge, UK, 2003), pp. 57–75. Lewis, “Female Life-writing and the Testamentary Discourse,” p. 63. I use the definition of ‘service’ offered by Anne Curry and Elizabeth Matthew: “the word commonly used for the work, whether paid or unpaid, performed by a servant, attendant or official for his or her lord or lady, master or mistress”; “Introduction,” in Concepts and\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nAfter establishing in chapter 2 the genre and context of the testament as a discourse about ownership and memory, I consider in the last four chapters those objects described in Blanche’s testament, with some additional objects that can be added to Blanche’s collection based on evidence from other inventories or testaments. There are a number of ways to separate Blanche’s possessions into productive categories for analysis; I have chosen to divide the material by medium and use. Books, the largest single type of item described in Blanche’s testament, are discussed in chapter 3. The analysis of her metalwork objects and paintings follows in the next two chapters, first reliquaries and paintings, and then jewelry and precious stones. The term I will use to describe metalwork objects is joyaux, the word used to describe them in medieval inventories.16 Finally, the last chapter is devoted to Blanche’s textiles, such as vestments, room hangings that decorated her household, and her clothing. Blanche’s motivations for patronage aligned her with those of many other medieval women who sought benefit­­­– political, social, and spiritual – through participation in the creation and dissemination of the visual arts.17 Particularly important for this study is the historiography of the patronage of royal women, who had the resources to commission works of art much more ambitiously than did most medieval women.18 These queenship studies have developed\n\n16\n\n17 18\n\nPatterns of Service in the Later Middle Ages, ed. Anne Curry and Elizabeth Matthew (Woodbridge, UK, 2000), p. xiv. Timothy Husband, in his discussion of John, duke of Berry’s collecting practices, defined joyaux as: “any object of goldsmiths’ works generally studded with gemstones and often decorated with enamels … Joyaux also included vessels of cut and polished rock crystal or a variety of semiprecious hardstones mounted in gold and likewise enameled and studded with gems”; The Art of Illumination: The Limbourg Brothers and the Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry (New York, 2008), p. 19. For case studies of female patronage, see the essays in The Cultural Patronage of Medieval Women, ed. June Hall McCash (Athens, Ga., 1996). A model for my study of the material culture of Blanche of Navarre is the analysis of the patronage of Mahaut of Artois by Jules-Marie Richard, who linked Mahaut’s patronage to her biography using the plentiful documentary evidence in the Archives of the Pas-deCalais; Une petite-nièce de Saint Louis, Mahaut, comtesse d’Artois et de Bourgogne (1302– 1329). Étude sur la vie privée, les arts et l’industrie, en Artois et à Paris au commencement du XIVe siècle (Paris, 1887). An early study of a queen’s image in the visual arts with an explicitly feminist motivation is Claire Richter Sherman’s “Taking a Second Look: Observations on the Iconography of a French Queen, Jeanne de Bourbon (1338–1378),” in Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany, ed. Norma Broude and Mary Garrard (New York, 1982), pp. 100–117. The collected essays in Capetian Women, ed. Kathleen Nolan (New York, 2003), offer varied models and case studies for understanding the patronage of medieval women associated with this dynasty. Kathleen Nolan studied the ways in which 12th- and\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\ntheoretical models for understanding how queens accessed and exercised power. If we consider, according to Theresa Earenfight’s model, that queenship was a “discursive practice” and “a daily act of reconstruction and interpretation,” Blanche’s identity – and her status and privileges that came with it – was in part dependent on her choices and the way she presented her identity as a dowager queen.19 Scholars have suggested that two roles in particular were important for medieval dowager queens, that of mediator and that of mother, both of which offered access to power.20 An analysis of Blanche’s testament and patronage of the visual arts demonstrates that she sought to emphasize her identification with each of these roles.\n\n19 20\n\n13th-century Capetian queens asserted their identities visually through seals and tombs in Queens in Stone and Silver: The Creation of a Visual Imagery of Queenship in Capetian France (New York, 2009). Recently, Therese Martin has edited a two-volume set of essays with many significant contributions to the study of the patronage of medieval queens: Reassessing the Roles of Women as ‘Makers’ of Medieval Art and Architecture, 2 vols. (Leiden, 2012). The essays in this publication address queens from different areas in Europe, including France, Iberia, and England, a valuable cross-cultural comparison.

Without question, the most important patron to consider for framing the analysis of Blanche of Navarre’s patronage is Jeanne of Evreux, her aunt. Blanche was married at the queen’s château in 1350, they worked in unison as mediators between Charles of Navarre and the French kings, they both furnished objects for chapels at Saint-Denis, and Blanche left instructions for her funeral to follow the model of Jeanne’s. The surviving testamentary acts of Jeanne of Evreux help to contextualize Blanche’s testament, as well as assist in the tracing of objects that passed through the collections of each queen.21 The patronage and object ownership of Jeanne has been extensively published, a result of the fame of her book of hours today at The Cloisters (Fig. 3.1) and her Virgin and Child reliquary statuette (Fig. 4.4), given to Saint-Denis in 1339 and today part of the collection of the Louvre; both items will be discussed below.22 The larger context for Blanche’s object ownership is the ambitious and wide-ranging patronage of works of art by members of the French royal family in the second half of the 14th century.23 Blanche knew personally nearly all the 21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nJeanne of Evreux’s final testament and two codicils are lost but were copied in the 17th century by Jacques Menant: Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 3403, Leber 5870.

(Paris, 1838), 19:120–69. For the queen’s astute control over her testaments and memory, see Elizabeth A.R.

This period and the gifting practices of the Valois princes has been studied by Brigitte Buettner, “Past Presents: New Year’s Gifts at the Valois Courts c. 1400,” Art Bulletin 83, no. 4 (Dec. 2001), 598–625. The competition among Valois princes for lavish works of art is also\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\ngreat art patrons in France in the decades between 1350 and 1400, among them the French king Charles V, and his brothers Louis of Anjou, John of Berry, and Philip of Burgundy.24 The collections of these individuals were vast, they were well inventoried, and many of their works survive; they serve therefore as valuable comparative evidence for Blanche’s collection. The scholarly patronage studies of men like John of Berry and women like Jeanne of Evreux have linked the patrons’ personalities to their object collecting, seeking to elucidate taste and aesthetic preferences; this model is important to my interpretation of Blanche’s testament.25 The smaller collections and patronage practices of royal women like Jeanne of Burgundy, Blanche of Orléans, and Jeanne of Rohan will also serve as important comparative material, especially with regard to their testamentary practices and the evidence of their motivations in commissioning and disseminating works of art. Recent patronage studies, particularly those that consider medieval women, have complicated the traditional definition of a patron: the person who paid for the work.26 Though payment records for Blanche of Navarre do survive in\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\nconsidered by Timothy Husband as one of the defining markers of their patronage; “Jean de France, duc de Berry,” in The Art of Illumination, pp. 10–31. The increase in the number of books collected by the Valois beginning with Charles V is noted by Joan Holladay, who suggests that “a library of a certain size was considered a necessary accoutrement for a prince of a certain status”; “Fourteenth-century French Queens,” p. 96. Among the many publications on these figures, those associated with exhibitions have offered substantive overviews of their patronage, such as Paris 1400: les arts sous Charles VI (Paris, 2004); Art from the Court of Burgundy: Patronage of Philip the Bold and John the Fearless, 1364–1419 (Cleveland, 2004); Husband, The Art of Illumination, as well as the older Les fastes du gothique: le siècle de Charles V (Paris, 1981). In his recent study of the duke’s patronage, Timothy Husband noted that it is possible to describe the duke’s taste in objects, a taste he describes as “conspicuous extravagance”; “Jean de France, duc de Berry,” in The Art of Illumination, pp. 10–31. Michael Camille also studied the connections between the duke’s personality and his patronage of works of art: “‘For Our Devotion and Pleasure’: The Sexual Objects of Jean, Duc de Berry,” in Other Objects of Desire: Collectors and Collecting Queerly, ed. Michael Camille and Adrian Rifkin (Oxford, 2001), 7–32. For the patronage of Jeanne of Evreux, see Boehm, “Le mécénat de Jeanne d’Évreux,” pp. 15–31.

Patronage, the Canon, and the Problematics of Agency in Romanesque and Gothic Art,” in A\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nfragmentary form, none is thorough enough to create a full picture of how and when she spent her funds on works of art. Indeed, for one of the most important monuments of her life, the funerary chapel of herself and her daughter Jeanne, discussed above, she collaborated at least in part with the French king Charles V.27 At the same time, the charter initial shows Blanche of Navarre presenting the chapel; she holds the model of the chapel firmly in her own hands (Fig. 1.1). Other objects, like the room hangings decorated with the letter B that Blanche acquired between 1396 and 1398 (discussed in chap. 6), might have been gifts rather than purchases. In her study of Blanche’s testament, Brigitte Buettner suggested that it should serve as an impetus for reconsideration of paradigms of medieval patronage, arguing that a notion of patronage that involves a contract between two persons does not sufficiently characterize the patterns of object movement memorialized in Blanche’s will.28 Therese Martin has proposed that a model for understanding medieval patronage might focus on the ‘maker’: “a person without [whom] the work would not exist.”29 Martin’s example to illustrate the role of the maker is the Eleanor Vase, which has an inscription noting its ownership by Eleanor of Aquitaine before it came into the possession of Abbot Suger and Saint-Denis. Martin writes that “Eleanor ‘made’ neither the original vase nor its metalwork additions, but her prestige was such that the object was considered to have proceeded more from her than from any of the men through whose hands it also passed.”30 In this book,\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29 30\n\nCompanion to Medieval Art: Romanesque and Gothic in Northern Europe, ed.

A document dated 4 November 1371, arranging the transport of the body of Jeanne of France back to Paris, stated in part the king’s obligation, which seems to have included having Jeanne’s tomb created: “Item, le Roy fera apporter le corps de ledite madame Jehanne à Saint-Denys en France où elle a esleve sa sepultre et fera faire tous les services, obsèques et solennitez à cause de ce dedenz la Toussains prouchain venant ou plus tost s’il puer estre fait bonnement.

Professor Buettner and I discussed our mutual interest in Blanche of Navarre in 2002 when I shared my dissertation chapter with her. Her theoretical model for patronage proposed in this article has been an important influence on my own study of Blanche’s collection.

Martin, “Exceptions and Assumptions,” p. 8.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlanche is the patron and the ‘maker,’ because the objects she owned are associated with her and her ancestors; she was the conduit for their dissemination. To be a conduit for a work of art, or a gift-giver, was also an avenue for the exercise of power.31 It was particularly important for medieval queens, whose access to political power might otherwise be relatively limited. In the next chapter, I analyze the implications for Blanche of inheriting the joyaux of her husband, Philip VI. Though the joyaux are not named individually in the will of Philip VI (with the exception of a crown, analyzed further below), among them must have been the reliquary belt and the beloved diamond discussed in the first paragraph of this introduction. At the end of her life she still had five of his metalwork items, an indication also that she had utilized this agency by giving away most of the metalwork. By giving Blanche his joyaux, Philip VI bestowed on her a lifelong gifting agency, raising her status and making her a particularly potent force in the heated competition for works of art of the Valois court. The five objects remaining – a reliquary belt and brooch, a sealing ring, a diamond ring, and a diamond that he loved (all discussed in chap. 5) – went to the French king, Charles VI, and to the dukes of Bourbon, Burgundy, and Berry. Blanche could garner influence with the French king and his uncles by giving them these objects owned by her late husband and their ancestor.32 An analysis of Blanche as a patron raises the related issue of visual display and the role of works of art in creating and reifying status, especially for someone whose power and influence depended on the continued assertion of her position as dowager queen. In addition, Blanche may have been insecure as a result of not having been crowned, a factor that will be analyzed in the next chapter. Blanche owned and commissioned a number of works that were meant to display her status to others, such as the reliquary belt and sealing ring from her husband. These two objects are quite clearly about power associated with visual display since a belt is part of the regalia of a king and a ring is used 31\n\n32\n\nBrigitte Buettner has studied the annual ritual of gift-giving known as the étrennes during the reign of Charles VI in “Past Presents: New Year’s Gifts at the Valois Courts c. 1400,” pp. 598–625. Another queen who used gifts to leverage power was Blanche of Castile; Miriam Shadis has described this queen’s collecting and gifting practices as part of her duties as mediator and a kind of ‘undocumented’ source of power; see Miriam Shadis, “Blanche of Castile and Facinger’s ‘Medieval Queenship’; Reassessing the Argument,” in Capetian Women, pp. 137–61; for this argument specifically, see p. 145. Mariah Proctor-Tiffany has analyzed the gift strategies of Clémence of Hungary in “Transported as a Rare Object of Distinction: The Gift-giving of Clémence of Hungary, Queen of France,” Journal of Medieval History 41, no. 2 (2015), 208–28.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nto seal documents and to confer official approval. Beyond these objects, the tomb project at Saint-Denis is also part of a visual display of status: the figures on the tomb were arrayed to emphasize Blanche’s descent from Saint Louis. The importance of regalia and royal identity recurs as a theme, both in its celebration and in the piety or humility that was occasionally signaled when such regalia was sold or given away. I also consider gender analysis with regard to the acquisition and dissemination of works of art.33 Blanche constructed gender for her recipients (in other words, she thought particular objects were suited to men or women, something that will be particularly evident in the chapter on books), and she made reference to gender roles. For example, a book from which her daughter learned to read was given to a woman; in this way Blanche commemorated the role of women as educators of young family members. A series of crowns given to her goddaughters described Blanche’s obligation to provide financially for these girls on the occasion of their marriages (the gifts of the crowns are analyzed in chap. 5). A gendered provenance (if a man or a woman had owned an object previously) might have been another way for Blanche to direct her possessions, but she did not seem to privilege the dissemination of objects in this way.34 It seems more likely that the gendered identity created by the gift of an object depended on the intention of the giver and the content (the subject matter of a book, for instance) rather than on any gendered quality associated with an object by its provenance; an example would be Blanche’s gift of the psalter of Saint Louis, which had been owned by Agnes and Jeanne of Burgundy, to Philip of Burgundy (Fig. 3.3). As a result of having so much textual information in the testament about what objects looked like, this project also has a distinctive focus on the materiality of the objects in Blanche’s collection. Analysis of materials and the symbolic importance assigned to them help to elucidate patterns of meaning. For example, Blanche gave away twenty-eight reliquaries in her will: eighteen were given to churches, ten to individuals. The reliquaries given to churches were nearly all silver or silver-gilt, whereas those given to individuals are described as gold. None given to churches have precious stones on them, but 33\n\n34\n\nThe ways in which gender might be used as a category for analyzing medieval art have been described by Sherry C.M. Lindquist, “Gender,” in Medieval Art History Today: Critical Terms, pp. 113–30. See also Rachel Dressler, “Continuing the Discourse: Feminist Scholarship and the Study of Medieval Visual Culture,” Medieval Feminist Forum 43, no. 1 (2007), 15–34. For a different perspective on gendered objects in Blanche’s will, see Brigitte Buettner’s discussion of “le sexe des objets” in “Le système des objets,” pp. 37–62.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nnearly all of the objects given to individuals do. What can we learn about the value and meaning of materials like gold, silver, and precious stones in the Middle Ages by studying Blanche’s collecting and gifting practices? Beyond meaning and appearance, I also consider use and storage. Why might one work rather than another be kept near Blanche’s bed, for example? Blanche’s testaments offer a trove of evidence for such analysis. The discussion of materials reflects another important methodological interest, namely, in material culture. The interdisciplinary method is complex and encompasses a number of different areas of study, but here I am interested in the dissolution of traditional differentiations in art-historical study between high art and ‘minor arts,’ such as metalwork or domestic textiles.35 My approach foregrounds the analysis of the life of the object as it was acquired, used and enjoyed, and redeployed by its owner.36 I also consider how Blanche described her objects and what that may indicate about how she valued them. A related methodological approach to material culture is the study of collecting. What might a manuscript owned by Saint Louis have signified for him and how would this meaning have been altered for a later owner? In other words, how does a change in the context in which the same work of art is perceived over generations create new meaning? Should Blanche of Navarre be considered a ‘collector’ or is such a designation anachronistic? Did Blanche perceive the things she commissioned or owned to be part of a collection, or is that term 35\n\n36\n\nSee Michael Yonan, “Toward a Fusion of Art History and Material Culture Studies,” West 86th: A Journal of Decorative Arts, Design History, and Material Culture 18, no. 2 (Fall 2011), 232–48, and Christopher Tilley, “Introduction,” in Handbook of Material Culture (London, 2006), pp. 1–6. An important study of the material culture of medieval courts is Malcolm Vale, The Princely Court: Medieval Courts and Culture in North-West Europe, 1270–1380 (Oxford, 2001). For recent discussions of material culture particularly relevant to art history, see Beth Williamson, “Material Culture and Medieval Christianity,” in The Oxford Handbook of Medieval Christianity (Oxford, 2014), pp. 60–75, and the essays in Everyday Objects: Medieval and Early Modern Material Culture and Its Meanings, ed.

Allyson Poska, Jane Couchman, and Katherine McIver (Farnham, Surrey, UK, 2013), pp. 469–88. For this I depend on the theoretical model proposed by Arjun Appadurai, “Introduction: Commodities and the Politics of Value,” in The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective, ed. Arjun Appadurai (Cambridge, 1986), pp. 3–63. For a perceptive application of Appadurai’s ideas to the history of ownership of works of art, see Anne Higonnet, “Afterword: The Social Life of Provenance,” in Provenance: An Alternate History of Art (Los Angeles, 2012), pp. 195–209.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nmore appropriate for post-Renaissance history? For this project, I use Pierre Alain Mariaux’s definition of collecting: “the collection is an assembly of chosen objects (for their beauty, rarity, curious character, documentary value, or expense), and it presupposes the presence of an individual, a collector. It is he or she who makes a deliberate choice.”37 By this definition, the implications of which are evident throughout the book, Blanche was a collector. In this study I consider all of this evidence, combining several approaches: art historical and material (interpreting the objects); historical (reconstructing Blanche’s milieu and analyzing archival evidence); and literary (analyzing the text of the testament as an autobiographical document). From this extensive evidence emerges a portrait of a female patron in the Middle Ages; on view are her aesthetic choices, exercises of power and authority, visual display of identity, and relationships with relatives and members of her household. The strength of this cross-media approach to objects permits the analysis of commissions like the tomb project at Saint-Denis with the descriptions of the testament, considering the elements that tie these different projects together and how they speak to each other. I want to look at the constellation of objects – a personal visual culture – that radiates out from one person. The division of the book by material is unfortunately artificial and downplays Blanche’s relationships with people and her desire to link gifts; only occasionally in each chapter do I discuss the gifts to a single person as a group. But in a book about material culture it seems crucial to focus on the objects themselves, and the analysis of the diamond that Philip VI “loved a lot” is more compelling when it is paired with the study of Blanche’s other diamonds and precious stones, rather than with the book of hours that was the other gift Blanche gave to the duke of Berry. Separating the items by material is also beneficial to modern scholars because it abides by the boundaries of disciplinary research, so that a discussion of textiles, for example, is easier to find in chapter 6 than if it were scattered throughout the book. One of my primary goals is to make Blanche’s testament, an extraordinary document that is still too little-known, more accessible, and it seems to me that this organization of the material is one of the best ways to do this. To assist the reader in understanding the stakes and the larger implications of the family ties that were marked with objects, a brief overview of family relationships at the French court follows. Blanche’s life spanned the rule of four French kings, all members of the Valois dynasty: Philip VI (r. 1328–50), John II (r. 1350–64), Charles V (r. 1364–80), and Charles VI (r. 1380–1422). These 37\n\nPierre Mariaux, “Collecting (and Display),” in A Companion to Medieval Art, pp. 213–32.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nTable 0.1 Genealogical table of the family of Blanche of Navarre, part 1.

Also of high status at court were those individuals descended from Philip IV (r. 1285–1314), such as Jeanne of Evreux, as well as Blanche herself and her brothers and sisters. I argue that Blanche saw herself as the repository of this family history and that the testament bestowed this authority and identity, through objects, on the family members still alive in 1396. Included in this group were King Charles VI, his wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, and the king’s uncles, John, duke of Berry, Philip, duke of Burgundy, and Louis, duke of Bourbon, as well as the brother of Charles VI, Louis, duke of Orléans, and the wives of all of these dukes. The fraying of these family ties was an impetus for the crises of the Hundred Years war, which dragged on with various levels of intensity throughout Blanche’s life; I discuss her involvement in it in the next chapter.\n\n17\n\nIntroduction\n\nTable 0.2 Genealogical table of the family of Blanche of Navarre, part 2.

In her testament, Blanche left her a hat that was still unfinished (the only object so described in the testament) and a book of hours that she said she had bought in Paris (again, it was rare that she would indicate that an item was purchased). These gifts, along with bedsheets and another book, full of advice, were intended surely for the bride on the occasion of her wedding; they are all considered in the analysis that follows. In addition to revealing the gifts that Blanche thought appropriate for a wedding gift for a niece, this bequest also tells us about the use of clothing, bedding, and books, as well as the distinction between things that had to be purchased and things that she owned that she would give the bride. This evidence is available not through payment records, as in the wedding of Jeanne of France discussed at the beginning of this introduction, but through the bequests of the testament.

It shows us Blanche’s obligations, how she constructed gender for her recipients, and what objects might mark an important transition in status for a medieval woman.\n\nThe Life and Patronage of Blanche of Navarre\n\n19\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe Life and Patronage of Blanche of Navarre In 1372, Blanche furnished the two-bay chapel of Saint Hippolyte, the first chapel west of the south transept at the abbey church of Saint-Denis, to serve as a burial site for her recently deceased daughter, Jeanne (Fig. 1.2).1 This chapel is the best-known of her commissions because Saint-Denis, wealthy abbey and privileged royal burial site, has been abundantly documented relative to other medieval monuments, even if very few objects survive from Blanche’s chapel today.2 The chapel exhibits many of the same interests and strategies that recur in Blanche’s will and in the other evidence of the material culture of her household – her devotional interests, her desire to be remembered after death, and her association of herself with illustrious family members. In this first chapter, I consider the biography of Blanche of Navarre as it can be reconstructed from medieval documentary sources and as it intersected with her commission of works of art.3 The analysis of the 1396 and 1398 testaments, the most substantive evidence we have for Blanche’s patronage, is reserved for the second chapter; the testaments, because they were written from Blanche’s viewpoint, offer a perspective different from those of the other documentary sources for 1 Though the documents related to the planning of the chapel foundation date to the early 1370s, Damien Berné has suggested that it is likely that Blanche had conceived of the chapel as an appropriate funerary site in the early 1350s, after the death of her husband, who had died on the feast day of Saint Hippolyte; “L’action mémorielle des princesses capétiennes à SaintDenis au XIVe siècle,” Histoire de l’art 63 (Oct. 2008), 35–44; for this material, pp. 39–40. 2 This material was published in part in my essay “Memory and Identity in the Chapel of Blanche of Navarre at Saint-Denis,” in Citation, Intertextuality and Memory in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, vol. 2: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Medieval Culture, ed. Yolanda Plumley and Giuliano di Bacco (Liverpool, 2013), pp. 123–36. 3 Two publications by André Lesort provide the most detailed sources for Blanche’s biography: “La Reine Blanche dans le Vexin et le Pays de Bray,” Mémoires de la Société historique et archéologique de l’arrondissement de Pontoise et du Vexin 54 (1948), 35–67 and 55 (1954), 9–88.

Una dama al servicio de su linaje,” in La dama en la corte bajomedieval, ed. Martí Aurell et al. (Pamplona, 2001), pp. 75–116. Two books that include the life of Blanche as part of a broader study of the biographies of other queens are Catherine Bearne, Lives and Times of the Early Valois Queens: Jeanne de Bourgogne, Blanche de Navarre, Jeanne d’Auvergne et de Boulogne (London, 1899) and Jean-Marie Cazilhac, Jeanne d’Evreux, Blanche de France, deux reines de France, deux douairières, durant la Guerre de Cent Ans (Paris, 2010).\n\n© Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016 | doi 10.1163/9789004318830_003\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nFigure 1.1 Blanche of Navarre presenting the chapel of Saint Hippolyte, with family and saints, 1372.

The two initials differ only slightly. The design of the crown atop the letter B has fleur-de-lis in the first and leaf fleurons in the second; the two documents differ as well in the marginal characters inhabiting the shapes of the initial B.9 Both initials have a large heraldic device in the left margin showing Blanche’s coat of arms: France, Evreux, and Navarre. This heraldic device provides the ‘portrait’ of the image; it is not a physiognomic likeness of Blanche, Philip, or Jeanne, but, as is typical of the 14th century, names, heraldry, and family relationships are used to establish identity.10 The paintings, sculpture, and metalwork of Blanche’s chapel followed some of the same themes of the charter initials, such as an emphasis on identity linked to family, but none of the works survive beyond the marble tomb gisants (Fig. 1.5). The appearance of the chapel can be reconstructed in part, however, from 17th- and 18th-century descriptions.11 Opposite the altar of Saint Hippolyte in the two-bay chapel was a black marble tomb with white marble tomb ­figures; these were recorded for the antiquarian François Roger de Gaignières in the late 17th century (Fig. 1.4).12 Only these tomb figures survive today; they are now grouped in the chapel of Saint Hippolyte with a number of other tomb figures that were not originally intended for this chapel. There were also twenty-four standing statues made of white stone arrayed around the tomb, Blanche’s relatives both living and dead.13 These figures were organized 9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 13\n\nIn the ‘original,’ a soul is carried by angels in a cloth above a figure in a miter with soldiers in the curves of the letter B. In the copy, a seated solder is at the bottom left in the letter B, while a one-legged beast and disembodied faces inhabit the rest of the spaces of the letter. For a consideration of likeness or portaiture in such illustrated charters in the second half of the 14th century, see Stephen Perkinson, The Likeness of the King: A Prehistory of Portraiture in Late Medieval France (Chicago, 2009), pp. 231–38. For the later descriptions of the chapel, Jacques Doublet, Histoire de l’abbaye de S. Denys en France (Paris, 1625), pp. 329 and 1333–34, and Michel Félibien, Histoire de l’abbaye royale de saint Denys en France (Paris, 1706), p. 560. There was also a 1634 inventory that recorded objects at Saint-Denis with Blanche’s coat of arms; these are described in Blaise de Montesquiou-Fezensac and Daneille Gaborit-Chopin, Le trésor de Saint-Denis, 3 vols. (Paris, 1973), 1:276–77. The Gaignières images are Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Département des Estampes, Pe 11 C, fol. 95r.

Though Doublet could not identify all the statues because some were damaged, the figures included the saint’s daughter Agnes of Burgundy, Philip III, Philip IV, Louis X, Blanche’s parents Jeanne and Philip of Navarre, her sisters Marie and Agnes, and her brother Louis.14 The brothers of Charles V were also represented on the tomb: John, duke of Berry; Philip, duke of Burgundy; and Louis, duke of Anjou. Of the identified statues, only Blanche’s sister Agnes, her brother Louis, and the brothers of Charles V were still living in 1372. The white marble gisants of Blanche and her daughter are among the very few 14th-century images of the two women that survive (Fig. 1.5). The sculptor of these gisants has been identified as a follower of Jean de Liège.15 In the recumbent figure, Blanche is shown wearing a wimple, a long-sleeved cote or kirtle, and over this garment the sleeveless, open-sided surcote, called the surcote-ouverte, associated with women of high status in the second half of the 14th century.16 Her daughter also wears a surcote, with panels in the front, perhaps intended to indicate the decoration of the garment in a different fabric. Jeanne’s hair is visible; it is parted in the middle and partially braided, with the braids crossing over the top of of her head and looping on either side of her face, a fashionable mid-14th-century hairstyle.17 The ridge and indentations where a metal crown was once attached are visible on the head of Blanche 14\n\n15 16\n\n17\n\nDoublet lists the figures: “Premierement, la Duchesse de Bourgogne Agnes, fille de Saint Louys, beseole de la Reyne; Le Roy Charles de Sicile; le Roy saint Louys; le Roy Philippe son fils; Messire Louys de Navarre Duc de Duras Comte de Beaumont le Roy; S.

The last queen of Navarre in Doublet’s list may refer to Jeanne of Evreux, who was queen of Navarre by virtue of her marriage to Charles IV, or alternately to Jeanne of France, the wife of Charles II. There are errors in Doublet’s transcription: Blanche’s sister Agnes was not the countess of Brie but the countess of Foix and her brother Louis was the count of Beaumont-le-Roger.

In her clothing and pose, and in the inclusion of a pair of dogs facing away from each other, Blanche’s gisant is similar to that of her mother, Jeanne, queen of Navarre, buried in Saint-Denis after her death in October 1349 (Fig. 1.8). Whether Blanche herself commissioned this tomb is a question considered below. Jeanne also wears a surcote, long-sleeved cote, a wimple, and a crown.

Philip VI again wears a houce, in this case red, while Blanche and Jeanne wear the surcotes-ouvertes.25 Blanche wears a white wimple, as expected for a widow. Jeanne’s surcote is decorated with fleur-de-lis and the heraldic devices of Evreux and Navarre. These devices function primarily to convey identity; whether a surcote might indeed be decorated in this way is difficult to determine from this evidence alone.26 Blanche’s chapel included another element that might have drawn SaintDenis visitors to her chapel and better perpetuated her memory: a copy of the well-known medieval Italian pilgrimage image, the Volto Santo of Lucca.27 Copies of the Volto Santo, an image of the risen Christ on the cross, were popular at the French court in the late 14th century.28 For the uninitiated, a painted inscription on a pillar in the chapel described the miracles that were associated with the Volto Santo, reinforcing the importance of this copy at the abbey.29 Blanche’s copy, probably emblazoned with her coat of arms, as in the early 18th century Félibien described it as a “present of this queen,” would have attracted the fashionable and the curious, all of whom, ideally, would then have remem-\n\n24\n\n25 26 27 28\n\n29\n\nThere is some debate over who is depicted in these paintings. Since the paintings were in the chapel of Saint Hippolyte, almost certainly depicted here are Philip VI, Blanche of Navarre, and their daughter Jeanne.

The images of Blanche, her daughter, and her husband (who was not himself buried in the chapel but in the crossing at Saint-Denis) were repeated in the painted column-statues, as well as in the paintings and on the tomb. Images of Saint Louis appeared both in the painting and on the tomb, and the tomb of Saint Louis himself was not far from the chapel, in the crossing at Saint-Denis. The images of Blanche and her family members and her coat of arms labeled on object after object would have emphasized the purpose of the chapel: the care of the souls of Blanche, her husband, and her daughter, through the prompting of prayers by visitors to the chapel. These strategies of repetition in the chapel were not just to make permanent the immateriality of memorial; they were also a sign of anxiety that the queen and her family would not be properly remembered in the prayers of those visiting the chapel, or that they might be remembered inaccurately. It was a particularly acute issue for Blanche of Navarre, who was furnishing her chapel in 1372 after two decades in which her brother Charles was nearly constantly at war with the French kings. The chapel served as a way for Blanche to dictate the presentation of her memory. Visitors to the chapel would not remember her rebellious brother Charles of Navarre (the question of whether he was represented on the tomb cannot be answered, as the identities of several damaged figures are not known and he may have been among them); rather, they would have seen images of a virtuous and devout queen surrounded by the French kings and other esteemed family members. Blanche’s chapel was one of many that were thus endowed and furnished in the 14th century at Saint-Denis; there was a fashion for endowing tomb chapels 30\n\n31\n\nThough, as Mailon Doquang notes, we cannot be certain that the chapels’ contents were visible; she argues that it was likely they were secured by visually permeable gates or were left open occasionally; the many representations of identity in the chapel would have been much less worthwhile for memorialization if the chapel were not accessible; Doquang, “Status and the Soul: Commemoration and Intercession in the Rayonnant Chapels of Northern France in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries,” in Memory and Commemoration in Medieval Culture, ed.

Margaret of Artois, the daughter of Philip V and Jeanne of Burgundy, and the widow of Louis II, count of Flanders, endowed the chapel of Saint Michel on the south side of the nave in 1363.33 Blanche’s chapel was most similar to the one furnished by the dowager queen Jeanne of Evreux in the 1340s – not surprising, considering that this queen had consistently served as a model for Blanche. It was just across the transept from Blanche’s chapel, and was also meant to serve as a memorial to her family.34 Fourteenth-century viewers would clearly have seen the visual parallels between the two chapels: Jeanne of Evreux’s chapel also had column-statues of herself, her husband Charles IV, and their two daughters.35 And although she herself was buried next to her husband in the crossing at Saint-Denis, the tombs of her daughters, Blanche and Marie, were in the chapel.36 The artist of the tomb figures of Blanche and Marie was Jean de Liège, a sculptor active in Paris in the 1360s and 1370s who had also worked for other royal patrons.37\n\nConflict with the Monks of Saint-Denis\n\nThe furnishing of Blanche’s chapel was likely completed by the mid-1370s and therefore served as a site for prayer and memorial for her daughter alone for more than twenty years, until Blanche’s own death, in 1398. She left detailed instructions in her will for the care of her body after death. If she died at her château at Neaufles (her residence for the last few decades of her life, near Gisors in Normandy), her body was to be taken to Saint-Denis, stopping only along the way at churches if the entourage needed to rest.38 If she died in Paris, her body was to be taken first to Saint-Jean-en-Grève, a parish church near her\n\n32\n\n33 34\n\n35 36 37 38\n\nFor this phase of chapel decoration, see Berné, “L’action mémorielle,” pp. 1–10, and Eva Leisterschneider, Die franzöische Königsgrablege Saint-Denis.

According to her instructions, she was to be clothed in purple velvet on a bier hung with cloth-of-gold, with the service at every church to have twelve candles weighing four livres each. For the services said at the mendicant orders of Paris (the Cordeliers, Jacobins, Augustines, and Carmelites), and at Bourg­ fontaine, each Mass was to have twelve wax candles, each weighing six livres, “around the representation of my body that will be there.”40 For the burial, she wrote: Item pour ce que après nostre trespassement nostre corps ne puet bonne­ ment miz ne enterré de lez nostre très chier seigneur et espoux le roy Phelippe, que Diex absoille, où il n’a pas place pour ce faire, nous ordonnons et voulons que, tantost après nostre trespassement, nostre corps soit mis et enterré tout entier en l’eglise de l’abbaye de monseigneur saint Denis en France, en la chapelle de monseigneur Saint Ypolite, que nous avons fondée, où nous [avons] fait mettre le corps de Jehanne de France, nostre fille, dont Diex ait l’ame, sanz faire nostre corps aucunement diviser, ne en icellui faire aucune incision, pour y estre enterrée en ensuivant, pour celle maniere, humblement et devotement, le commun usaige d’ensevelir et enterrer corps humains.41 [Because after my death my body cannot be buried near my very dear lord and spouse the king Philip, may God pardon him, because there is not space there, my body should be buried whole in the abbey of SaintDenis, in the chapel of Saint Hippolyte that I have founded, where I have buried my daughter, Jeanne, may God pardon her, without dividing my body, without making any incision, following the common usage of shrouding and burying corpses.] It would have presumably been obvious to the monks that Blanche intended to be buried in the chapel of Saint Hippolyte, as she had already donated the funds and furnished the chapel two decades before. These funeral arrangements – reminding all that she knew she could not be buried next to Philip VI but wished to be buried next to her daughter – demonstrate a desire to control 39 40 41\n\nDelisle 7.

The funeral ceremony was described, probably retrospectively, by the chronicler called the Religieux of Saint-Denis, who has been identified as Michel Pintoin (c. 1350-c. 1421), the chanter of the abbey; he wrote a history of the reign of Charles VI in which Blanche’s activities were occasionally of note.43 His characterization of Blanche is typical for a medieval queen, in that he described her as pious, generous, and a good mother. For him, Blanche was a repository of tradition at the court – he noted that Blanche, of great age and reputation, was consulted for the planning of the 1389 coronation of Isabeau of Bavaria; according to Pintoin, Blanche depended both on her memory of past coronations and on the historical records kept at Saint-Denis.44 In his description of her death in 1398, he wrote that she was a model of chastity and virtue, exemplary qualities of mothers.45 But in the next sentence Pintoin deviated suddenly from his anodyne stereotype of the medieval queen, writing: Because she was never crowned, the officers of the court asked the dukes of Burgundy, Orléans and Bourbon and others, if they should bring her to the church of Saint-Denis and bury her with the pomp and ornaments used for royal funerals.46 The dukes of the royal court did not seem to share this concern for Blanche’s status as an uncrowned queen, as they assented to her royal funeral at Saint-Denis. 42\n\n43 44 45 46\n\nElizabeth A.R. Brown has argued that the testamentary strategies of Jeanne of Evreux demonstrate her shrewd recognition that her testament was best executed in her lifetime; it would be her only guarantee that her wishes were carried out; “The Testamentary Strategies of Jeanne d’Évreux: The Endowment of Saint-Denis in 1343,” in Magistra Doctissima: Essays in Honor of Bonnie Wheeler, ed.

It seems likely that Pintoin, writing after the funeral ceremony had taken place, was not recording any serious contemporary concern about the burial of Blanche at Saint-Denis, but rather seized an opportunity to denigrate her status, the motivation for which I suggest below. It is clear from the detailed instructions left in the will that Blanche knew she might have to convince the monks that she was entitled to be buried at Saint-Denis. Pintoin’s pettiness about Blanche of Navarre’s status persisted in his description of the funeral, on 11 October 1398. He noted: The lighting furnished for the funeral ceremony was very paltry, and was only sufficient for a person of obscure condition. It was the testamentary executors of the queen who determined this expense. One can blame them generally for their greed, because one knew that Blanche had left great treasures.48 Blanche’s executors were the primary objects of Pintoin’s disdain here, but the dim lighting and inglorious conditions also afforded Pintoin an opportunity to disparage Blanche’s prestige: she might as well have been someone of obscure condition. It was presumably precisely to avoid such a condition that Blanche had so extensively decorated her chapel with images of herself and her family. At least one motivation for Pintoin’s derision about Blanche’s status as queen and her funeral is evident in his discussion of the disposition of Blanche’s possessions. He wrote that Blanche had given to the convent of the Carmelites in Paris a relic of a nail from the Crucifixion.49 The monks of Saint-Denis were outraged at this bequest because they owned the only nail relic in the French kingdom. Pintoin wrote: 47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n“Ces princes, par respect pour la mémoire de son magnanime époux, qui était la tige de leur race, jugèrent convenable de lui accorder tous ces honneurs”; Chronique du Religieux de Saint-Denys, 2:657. “Le luminaire fourni pour la cérémonie funèbre fut très mesquin, et eut à peine suffi pour une personne de condition obscure. C’étaient les exécuteurs testamentaires de la reine qui avaient réglé cette dépense. On les blama généralement de leur avarice; car on savait que madame Blanche avait laissé d’immenses trésors”; Chronique du Religieux de SaintDenys, 2:659. Chronique du Religieux de Saint-Denys, 2:661.\n\nThe Life and Patronage of Blanche of Navarre\n\n37\n\nMadame Blanche … honored with particular affection the house of the Carme­lites, and offered to it a very precious jewel, containing an iron nail that she claimed to be one of the nails of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and that she had bought, she said, from Venetian merchants who assured [they had] brought it from Constantinople. She was persuaded by the vain and false words of these merchants, despite the falseness of their claim, and had helped to spread this error and scandal in the kingdom. Because, following the witness of our old annals, it is the church of Saint-Denis in France which possesses this sacred jewel, and the equal does not exist elsewhere; this fact is proven by the history of Charlemagne and by the continuous miracles that have occurred for five hundred years with contact with this relic.50 The monks had recently celebrated their own nail relic; in 1397, Charles VI had donated a lavish reliquary for it, embellished with figures in gold of himself, Queen Isabeau of Bavaria, and the French dynastic saints Charlemagne and Saint Louis.51 The surfacing of another nail relic at another monastic house in Paris given by a royal donor was an intolerable slight to the prestige of the abbey. Pintoin’s strategy in his narrative was to paint Blanche as both too trusting (she was persuaded by the false words of the merchant) and unreliable (she had bought it, ‘she said,’ from Venetian merchants). Blanche anticipated the objections of the monks of Saint-Denis to her relic, as in her will she gave a detailed provenance for it: Item nous laissons au couvent des frères du Carme de Paris un reliquiaire d’or qui pent en nostre clotet, où il y a un clouet qui fu fait d’un des cloux Nostre Seigneur, lequel nostre dicte fille la duchesse d’Orleans nous lessa en son testament; et fu a madame la royne Jehanne. Et voulons et 50\n\n51\n\n“Madame Blanche aimait en effet beaucoup ces églises; mais elle honorait d’une affection toute particulière la maison des Carmélites, et lui avait solonellement offert un joyau très précieux, contenant un clou de fer, qu’elle prétendait être un des clous de Notre-Seigneur Jésus Christ, et qu’elle avait acheté, disait-elle, à des marchands vénitiens qui assuraient l’avoir apporté de Constantinople. Elle s’était laissé persuader par les vaines et mensongères paroles de ces marchands, malgré la fausseté de leur allégation, et avait contribué à repandre l’erreur et le scandale dans le royaume. Car, suivant le témoignage de nos antiques annales, c’est l’église de Saint-Denys en France qui possède ce joyau sacré, et le pareil n’existe nulle autre part; ce fait est prouvé par l’histoire de Charlemagne et par les miracles continuels que depuis cinq cents ans opère le contact de cette relique”; Chronique du Religieux de Saint-Denys, 2:661. Jenny Stratford, Richard II and the English Royal Treasure (Woodbridge, UK, 2012), p. 87.\n\n38\n\nChapter 1\n\nordonnons que ilz le gardent en leur dicte eglise perpetuelment comme digne saintuaire et pour l’amour d’elles et de nous.52 [I leave the brothers of the Carmelites in Paris a gold reliquary that hangs in my clotet, where there is a nail which was made of one of the nails of Our Lord, which my daughter the duchess of Orléans left me in her testament; and it belonged to the queen Jeanne. And I wish and order that they keep it in their church perpetually for love of them (Blanche of Orléans and Jeanne of Evreux) and of us.] The nail was indeed mentioned in the 1392 testament of Blanche of Orléans: Item, elle laissa à sa très chière Dame Madame la Royne Blanche, son bréviaire où elle disoit ses heures, un petit livret d’oroisons qui fu à la Royne Jehanne sa mère, avecques son petit reliquiaire ou il a du clou Notre-Seigneur, et se elle aloit de vie à trespassement avant que la ditte Madame la Duchesse, ycelle Madame la Duchesse volt que le dit reliquiaire soit et demoure à l’église Nostre-Dame du Carme à Paris, et ou cas que la ditte Madame la Royne Blanche survivra ycelle Madame la Duchesse, elle lui supplie quel dit reliquiaire après son décès, elle vueille laisser à la ditte église.53 [She leaves to her very dear lady Madame the queen Blanche, her breviary with which she says her hours, a little prayerbook that belonged to the queen Jeanne her mother, with her small reliquary which has the nail of Our Lord, and if she dies "
