        "text": "Queen of Navarre in 1479\n\nEleanor of Navarre,[a] (2 February 1426 – 12 February 1479), was a Navarrese princess and monarch. She served as the regent of Navarre from 1455 to 1479, during the absence of her father, and then briefly as the queen regnant of Navarre in 1479. She was crowned on 28 January 1479 in Tudela.\n\nShe was born in Olite, Navarre (now Spain), the third and youngest child of King John II of Aragon and Queen Blanche I of Navarre. She was the younger sister of Blanche II of Navarre. She was born 2 February 1426, and was acclaimed by the Cortes in Pamplona, 9 August 1427, as the legitimate heir of Charles of Viana (Charles \"IV\") and Blanche II of Navarre in succession to their mother. After their mother's death, however, their father occupied Navarre.\n\nShe married Gaston IV, Count of Foix, in 1441. In 1442, Eleanor moved with her spouse to Bearn. In 1455, her father deposed her brother and her sister as heirs of Navarre and proclaimed Eleanor as the heir and the regent and general governor of Navarre. In her new capacities, she moved to Sangüesa. She continued as regent after the death of her brother in 1461. In 1462, she signed the Treaty of Olite, in which she recognized her father as the monarch of Navarre and accepted to have her sister Blanche imprisoned under her care.\n\nIn 1464, Blanche died in her care, suspected to have been poisoned. By the treaty, she was recognized by her father as the heir of Navarre and his regent (governor) in Navarre. In 1468, her father killed her advisor Nicolas de Etchabarri, and deposed her as governor. In 1471, however, her father recognized her as the governor of Navarre until his death. At her father's death in 1479, she gave her oath as the monarch of Navarre and died two weeks later at Tudela, Navarre, aged 53.\n\nIn 1441, she married Gaston IV, Count of Foix, and had the following children with him:\n\nMarie of Foix (1443–1467); married William VIII of Montferrat.\n\nGaston, Prince of Viana (1445–1470); married Magdalena of France in 1462. Their children Francis and Catherine both succeeded to Navarre in turn upon the death of their grandmother Eleanor.\n\nPierre de Foix, le jeune (1449–1490); cardinal and Bishop of Arles.\n\nJohn of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne (1450–1500); his daughter Germaine of Foix was the second wife of Ferdinand II of Aragon.\n\nJeanne of Foix (1454–1476); married Jean V of Armagnac.\n\nEleanor of Foix (1457–1480); engaged firstly to Charles, duke de Guyenne (who died in 1472), and secondly to the Duke of Medinacelli, but died before the wedding.\n\nMargaret of Foix (1458–1487); married Francis II, Duke of Brittany; their daughter Anne of Brittany was the wife of Charles VIII of France and later the second wife of Louis XII of France.\n\nCatherine of Foix (1460–1494); married Gaston II de Foix, Count of Candale and Benauges; their daughter Anne of Foix-Candale was the third wife of Vladislaus II of Hungary.\n\nIsabella of Foix (1462–?); married Guy de Pons, Viscount of Turenne.\n\nAnne of Foix (born and died 1464).\n\nJacques de Foix, Count of Montfort (1463–1508), Count of Cortes; married Catherine of Beaumont.\n\nAnthony, R.
