        "text": "The Crusades were conflicts predominantly focused on the stories of knights, kings, popes, Christians, and Muslims. We have some stories of women like Eleanor of Aquitaine who joined their husbands in battle. However, some women’s stories tend to get lost in the sands of the past. Take, for example, Eleanor of Aquitaine’s daughter-in-law, Berengaria of Navarre, the wife of Richard the Lionheart. Amid the Third Crusades, she must join Eleanor of Aquitaine on a treacherous journey to meet her husband while he battles for Jerusalem. Can Richard and Berengaria survive the journey to and from the Holy Land and produce the desired heir for the English throne before their enemies can claim victory? Carol McGrath has chosen to tell the tale of the forgotten queen Berengaria of Navarre in her latest novel, “The Lost Queen.”\n\nI would like to thank Carol McGrath and Headline Books for sending me a copy of this novel. I am always looking for new heroes and heroines from the past to read about, whether it is historical fiction or nonfiction. I have heard the name Berengaria of Navarre mentioned in previous books about Plantagenet queens, but she is more of a footnote, so when I heard there was going to be a novel about her life, I knew I wanted to read it.\n\nThe year is 1191 and Berengaria of Navarre is meeting her future mother-in-law Eleanor of Aquitaine to embark on a journey to meet her future husband Richard the Lionheart in the Outremer. At the same time, Avelina FitzWilliam is planning her trip to the Outremer to find her husband William FitzWilliam who never returned from the Crusades. Avelina’s journey would not be as glamorous as Berengaria’s as she would go in disguise as a nun. Berengaria must also be wary of her surroundings as Philip of France is against the union altogether as Richard decided to pass on a union with Philip’s sister Alice of France to marry Berengaria.\n\nBerengaria and Avelina were united by chance and became the closest of friends through numerous trials. Not only did they have to deal with the dangerous Alps crossing, but they also had to deal with pirates, Saladin’s army, Crusader factions loyal to Philip of France, Walter of Winchester and Prince John in England, and women like Princess Irene of Cyprus who only had eyes for King Richard. Through all the chaos around them, at the heart of this novel, are two love stories, Berengaria and Richard and Avelina and William.\n\nAs someone who knew very little about the life of Berengaria of Navarre, I found this novel positively enthralling. It was filled with twists, turns, high drama, and romance. I loved reading this novel and I was genuinely sad when it ended. McGrath was able to craft a luscious novel that was meticulously researched that any fan of medieval historical fiction novels will adore. If this sounds like you, I highly suggest you read, “The Lost Queen” by Carol McGrath.\n\nThe Lost Queen\n\n1191 and the Third Crusade is underway . . .\n\nIt is 1191 and King Richard the Lionheart is on crusade to pitch battle against Saladin and liberate the city of Jerusalem and her lands. His mother, the formidable Eleanor of Aquitaine and his promised bride, Princess Berengaria of Navarre, make a perilous journey over the Alps in midwinter. They are to rendezvous with Richard in the Sicilian port of Messina.\n\nThere are hazards along the way – vicious assassins, marauding pirates, violent storms and a shipwreck. Berengaria is as feisty as her foes and, surviving it all, she and Richard marry in Cyprus. England needs an heir. But first, Richard and his Queen must return home . . .\n\nThe Lost Queen is a thrilling medieval story of high adventure, survival, friendship and the enduring love of a Queen for her King.\n\nAcclaim for Carol McGrath’s ROSE trilogy:\n\n‘Powerful, gripping, and beautifully told’ KATE FURNIVALL on The Silken Rose\n\n‘A tour de force of gripping writing, rich historical detail and complex, fascinating characters’ NICOLA CORNICK on The Stone Rose\n\n‘A beautifully narrated novel’ K J MAITLAND on The Damask Rose\n\nPurchase Link – https://tinyurl.com/5n8ab2xv\n\nAuthor Bio – Following a first degree in English and History, Carol McGrath completed an MA in Creative Writing from The Seamus Heaney Centre, Queens University Belfast, followed by an MPhil in English from the University of London.

Wife of Richard the Lionheart, daughter-in-law of Eleanor of Aquitaine, and a participant of the Third Crusade, Berengaria sat at the crossroads of several major political figures and events of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Yet her story has received scant attention by historians and the public until now.\n\nThis biography, including material not previously discussed in English scholarship, brings a new light to Berengaria’s life, covering her journeys from Navarre, across Europe to Sicily, Cyprus, the Holy Land, and then to the Angevin domains in France. It shows how women exercised power in medieval Europe, and brings to the fore a greater understanding of the life of one of England’s most forgotten queens. Grounded in academic research and written for the interested reader, this biography gives a welcome insight into Berengaria as a woman, queen, widow, and lord.\n\nBuy Link: https://www.routledge.com/Berengaria-of-Navarre-Queen-of-England-Lord-of-Le-Mans/Storey/p/book/9781032121475\n\nLaunch 20% discount code for purchases made through the Routledge website: EFLY01\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nDr Gabrielle Storey is a historian of monarchy, gender, and sexuality.

A wife who went on the Crusades with her first husband and chose her second husband. A fierce mother who defended her Plantagenet children no matter the cost. Eleanor of Aquitaine has been revered and reviled for centuries, some saying she was a powerful woman ahead of her time while others considered her someone who could manipulate those around her by having affairs, including supposedly with her uncle in Antioch. Her story has been told in numerous ways through different mediums throughout the centuries, but now Elizabeth Chadwick has decided to write her interpretation of Eleanor of Aquitaine’s life in a trilogy of historical fiction novels. The first in the series, “The Summer Queen,” explores Eleanor’s early years, her marriage to a young French king, and the man destined to become King of England.\n\nI have always been drawn to Eleanor of Aquitaine’s story since I first learned about her and the origins of the Plantagenet dynasty. I remember watching “The Lion in Winter” in college and I enjoyed the film, so I decided to study more about Eleanor and Henry II. When I heard that Elizabeth Chadwick had written a trilogy about the legendary queen, I knew I wanted to read it to see how she felt about Eleanor.\n\nWe begin our journey into the past when Eleanor (in this novel, Alienor) and her sister Petronella are getting ready to bid their father, William X Duke of Aquitaine, is about to set off on a pilgrimage, leaving the control of the duchy to Eleanor as his heiress. Her father’s final wish for his heiress was that she would marry the heir to the French throne, the soon-to-be King Louis VII. Eleanor reluctantly agrees and at first, the marriage seems to be successful, but after a miscarriage of a boy, Louis’ extreme piety, and his meddling mother Adelaide of Maurienne, Eleanor is at her wits end.\n\nAfter giving birth to a daughter named Marie, Louis has decided to join the Crusades and Eleanor must tag along, although she would rather have an annulment. The journey that the two embark on drives even more of a wedge between the couple as it is rumored that she was close to her uncle Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch and one Geoffrey de Rancon. In 1152, Louis and Eleanor receive their divorce; Eleanor may return to Aquitaine and remarry, but she must leave her two daughters, Marie and Alix, with their father in France. Eleanor does not stay single for long as Geoffrey of Anjou convinces the former queen to marry his young, hotheaded, handsome son who would become King Henry II of England by birthright thanks to his mother Empress Matilda.\n\nI have read both historical fiction and nonfiction accounts of Eleanor of Aquitaine’s life, but this novel truly made her feel alive, as well as the men and women that surrounded her at court. Even though I knew what was going to happen, it was still thrilling to read the story from multiple perspectives. I cannot wait to read the rest of this trilogy to see the birth of the Plantagenet dynasty. If you are a fan of the life and times of Eleanor of Aquitaine, you must check out, “The Summer Queen” by Elizabeth Chadwick.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCivil wars, clashes between cousins, are known to be full of battles between men on foot and horseback, with their eyes set on the throne of their desired country. Many stories of civil wars tend to leave out the women who often were left on the sidelines, ready to pick up the pieces. The story of the Anarchy is a bit different than other civil wars as one of the main figures was not a man, but Empress Matilda, the daughter of King Henry I and the rightful heiress of England facing off against the man who stole the throne from her, her cousin, King Stephen. However, it was not just Empress Matilda who defined what it meant to be a woman during the Anarchy. In her latest book, “Women of the Anarchy,” Sharon Bennett Connolly tells the stories of the mothers, sisters, and wives who defined this turbulent period that saw the end of one dynasty and the beginning of another.\n\nI want to thank Amberley Publishing for sending me a copy of this book. I have enjoyed Sharon Bennett Connolly’s previous books that I have read, “Ladies of the Magna Carta,” “Silk and Sword,” “Defenders of the Norman Crown,” and “King John’s Right Hand Lady.” When I heard that Connolly was writing about the women who were involved in the Anarchy, I was excited because it is one of my favorite conflicts in history to study. I wanted to see what new information Connolly would present in her book.\n\nConnolly begins by explaining how the conflict around the Anarchy arose and how Empress Matilda and Queen Matilda became the female faces of opposing sides of this civil war. Empress Matilda, the daughter of King Henry I, was the wife of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. However, her life took a dramatic turn when her only legitimate brother William Aetheling died on November 25, 1120, when the ship he was on, the White Ship, sank after a night of drunk sailing. As King Henry I’s last living legitimate child, Empress Matilda was the rightful heir to the English throne, even though she was a woman and she was willing to fight with everything in her power to sit on the throne. On the other side of the conflict was Queen Matilda of Boulogne, the wife of King Stephen. Although Queen Matilda or Empress Matilda could not wield a sword in battle, they showed that they were capable of fighting in their own unique ways.\n\nEmpress Matilda and Queen Matilda had grandmothers and mothers who showed them what it meant to be a queen and a mother who was willing to fight for their family. Women like Matilda of Flanders, Saint Margaret of Scotland, Matilda of Scotland, and Adeliza of Louvain showed the two Matildas how to help their husbands run a country while maintaining their strong identities as women rulers. However, Connolly does not stop just at the two Matildas when discussing royal women who had to navigate the Anarchy. We are introduced to interesting characters like Isabel de Vermandois, Ada de Warenne, Lucy Countess of Chester, Ela de Talvas, Mary of Boulogne, Isabel Countess of Warenne and Surrey, culminating with the story of Eleanor of Aquitaine.\n\nWhile other books focus on the Anarchy, by focusing on the two Matildas and other women affected by this conflict, Connolly brings something fresh to this story that is centuries old. It shows how their actions to protect their families brought forth change in England through the birth of the Plantagenet dynasty. This book is rich in details and is so well written as Connolly takes the time to distinguish between the Matildas, which there are quite a few in this book, and explain how the conflict started and finally how it was concluded. I think if you want a fabulous book about the Anarchy and the women who defined this period, I highly recommend you check out, “Women of the Anarchy” by Sharon Bennett Connolly.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we think about medieval women, we often think about very pious figures who relied on men, had numerous children, and would often fade into obscurity when they died. While this would be the ultimate fate for many women, it was not so for those close to thrones worldwide. In times of war and political upheaval, the daughters, the wives, and the queens picked up the pieces and patched their respective kingdoms back together. In her latest book, “Women of Power: Formidable Queens of the Medieval World,” Teresa Cole has chosen a select group of women to highlight her point about the strength of women who held power in the Middle Ages.\n\nI would like to thank Amberley Publishing for sending me a copy of this book. When I heard about this book, I had an inkling about which women would be included in this conversation, but I wanted to see who else Cole included in her book and if she decided to stay in England or venture off to other countries.\n\nThe group of powerful women that Cole has chosen to highlight in this book are Emma of Normandy, Matilda of Tuscany, Empress of Matilda, Matilda of Boulogne, Melisende of Jerusalem and her sisters of the Outremer, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. In terms of history, it is a span of close to three hundred years, covering everything from the Viking invasions of England, the Anarchy, the Holy Roman Empire vs the Papacy, the Crusades, and the reign of Henry II. It is a lot to cover in one book, but what Cole does well is that she has chosen women whose stories are interconnected to create a glimpse of the political environment in Europe and the Middle East during this time.\n\nBefore reading this book, I knew quite a bit about Emma of Normandy, Empress Matilda, Matilda of Boulogne, and Eleanor of Aquitaine, so those sections felt like a review for me. The stories of Matilda of Tuscany and Melisende of Jerusalem with her sisters of the Outremer were filled with new information for me and while I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Melisende of Jerusalem and the Outremer, I had such a struggle reading about Matilda of Tuscany.\n\nThere were so many popes, anti-popes, and Holy Roman Emperors during that period in which Matilda ruled Tuscany, I wish Cole had included some sort of chart to make it easier to follow. I also wish that Cole spent a little bit more time focusing on the women instead of their male counterparts in the chapters to truly highlight their strengths because there were points where I felt like the women were being lost in their chapters.\n\nOverall, I think Cole does a decent job highlighting the women and the periods in this book. It does show a glimpse into the hardships women had to endure to hold onto power in the medieval world. If you want to explore the Middle Ages with some new historical figures who left their marks on the past, I recommend you read, “Women of Power: Formidable Queens of the Medieval World” by Teresa Cole.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we think of the infamous queens of England, some names come to mind, but one rises to the top for the number of black myths and influence surrounding her name: Eleanor of Aquitaine. The orphaned Duchess of Aquitaine, who married the future King Louis VII of France, went on the Second Crusades with her husband, survived battles and kidnappings, and ended up divorcing her first husband because she couldn’t give a male son. So, she married the young Count of Anjou, who would become the first king of the Plantagenet dynasty, King Henry II, who had a large family and split her time between England and France. Eleanor would eventually side with her sons, rebel against Henry, and spend 15 years in prison. A fire-cracker of a queen, but how many of the stories surrounding the titular queen are true? In her latest biography, “Eleanor of Aquitaine: Queen of France and England, Mother of Empires,” Sara Cockerill dives deep into the archives to tell the true story of this much-maligned queen of England and France.\n\nI want to thank Amberley Publishing for sending me a copy of this book. I have enjoyed reading books about Eleanor of Aquitaine, and when I heard about this biography, I was fascinated. A few of my history friends have read this book and enjoyed it, so I wanted to see what the hype was about regarding this particular title.\n\nCockerill begins by showing what myths are typically associated with Eleanor of Aquitaine and how these myths have developed over time. She explains that Eleanor was a much more subdued queen than we imagined her to be and that her dive into the primary sources will show her readers the true Eleanor of Aquitaine. Cockerill then moves into the history of the Duchy of Aquitaine and Eleanor’s family, shaping her into the ruler and mother she would become.\n\nThe bulk of this book explores Eleanor of Aquitaine’s married life, first to King Louis VII of France and then to King Henry II of England. As Queen of France, Eleanor had two daughters, went on the Second Crusades, was kidnapped by pirates, and saw numerous battles. Eleanor’s reputation was blackened during the Crusades with the alleged Affair at Antioch. Still, Cockerill takes the time to go through the origins of each myth and show what might have happened according to the primary sources available. With the demise of the marriage of Eleanor and Louis VII, we see how Eleanor met Henry II and how her time as Queen of England was different than her time as Queen of France. We see her relationships with her sons and daughters and how her marriage with Henry went sour.\n\nMost of the primary sources Sara Cockerill explores are charters that Eleanor of Aquitaine worked on as Duchess of Aquitaine and as Queen of France and England. This means it is more academic, and for casual history lovers, it can come across as a bit dry in some places. Overall, I found this a compelling retelling of Eleanor of Aquitaine’s story that gave me a lot to think about her and her time. Suppose you want a new biography that will present a fresh approach to the life and times of Eleanor of Aquitaine. In that case, I highly recommend you read “Eleanor of Aquitaine: Queen of France and England, Mother of Empires” by Sara Cockerill.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we think about royal relationships from the past, we do not associate them with love; it is more about cementing power. Princes and kings knew how much was at stake, so they tended to have wives for politics and produce legitimate heirs that would inherit their kingdoms. For matters of love and lust, kings and princes would have mistresses, either of noble birth or lower, on the side. These women have been deemed whores and homewreckers but is that a fair assessment of their legacies? Julia A. Hickey takes a closer look at these misunderstood mistresses in her latest book, “Medieval Royal Mistresses: Mischievous Women who Slept with Kings and Princes.”\n\nThank you, Pen and Sword Books and Net Galley, for sending me a copy of this book. When I saw this title, it intrigued me, and I was hoping to learn something new.\n\nHickey covers several hundred years in this book, starting around the year 1000 and ending in 1485. We begin with Queen Emma, Aelfgifu, and the confusion of whether Aelfgifu should be considered a mistress. With these Anglo-Saxon and Norman kings of England, we see many relatively hidden mistresses of William I and Henry I (who had quite a few). We then move to the Plantagenets with Henry II, King John, Edward II, Edward III, and Edward IV. Hickey also pays attention to other affairs in different countries, such as King David of Scotland and the Tour de Neste Affair.\n\nSome of these mistresses would be familiar to readers, such as Isabella of Angouleme, Fair Rosamund, Piers Gaveston, Alice Perrers, Katherine Swynford, Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer, Jane Shore, Eleanor Talbot, and Elizabeth Woodville. Many were new to me, including Princess Nest of Wales, whose abduction started a war, Edith Forne Sigulfson, and Elizabeth Wayte. She even included Eleanor of Aquitaine as one of the mistresses mentioned in this book, which I’m afraid I have to disagree with, as most of this stems from the black legend that has tainted her legacy.\n\nI found the information provided in this book rather intriguing, but my one concern about this book was how it was structured. I wish Hickey had sections marked for each king she mentioned in this book so we could distinguish which mistress was associated with which king or prince.\n\nOverall, I found this book enjoyable and informative. It was a bit repetitive, and there were some arguments that I disagreed with. Still, the fact that Hickey could combine nearly 500 years’ worth of history about relatively hidden royal mistresses is quite admirable. Suppose you want a solid introduction to medieval England’s world of royal mistresses. In that case, I recommend you read “Medieval Royal Mistresses: Mischievous Women who Slept with Kings and Princes” by Julia A. Hickey.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nEnglish kings are some of the most recognizable monarchs in all of European history, and when we think of Kings of England, a few names pop into our minds. Edward, George, and William tend to be popular, but you cannot study English history without Henry. Eight kings of England were Henry, and they would change the history of England forever. These eight kings give us an entire range of what kingship was like in medieval Europe. From men born to be king to opportunists who decided to take the throne as their own, from saints to warrior kings, the Henrys of English history were a colorful group of characters. Each king has had numerous biographies written about him, but there has never been a collection of biographies about the kings named Henry until now. This is “Harry of England: The History of Eight Kings, From Henry I to Henry VIII” by Teresa Cole.\n\nI want to thank Amberley Publishing for sending me a copy of this book. When I saw this title, I was fascinated by the concept. I have read several books about certain Henrys, but I have never read one that talks about them all in one book.\n\nCole begins her book with the first Henry, the 4th son of William the Conqueror. The prospects of him ever becoming king was very slim, especially when William the Conqueror passed away and the crown went to William Rufus, the eldest son. Yet destiny took an unexpected turn when William Rufus was killed in a hunting accident, and Henry was there to take the throne before his other brothers had a chance. Henry had to deal with numerous rebellions and the tragedy of the White Ship, which killed his only legitimate son and heir. This led to the period of fighting between Henry’s daughter Matilda and Stephen of Blois, known as the Anarchy, which led to the reign of King Henry II and the beginning of the Plantagenet Dynasty.\n\nKing Henry II had his fair share of family drama with his sons and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, plus a deadly confrontation with his former best friend, Thomas Becket. The following Henry, Henry III did not have the best of starts to his reign as he followed King John and had to deal with barons’ war and external threats to the throne while balancing the Magna Carta. Luckily for Henry III, he had the longest reign of any medieval English king, fifty-six years.\n\nWe enter the Hundred Years’ War with France during the reign of Henry IV, the son of John of Gaunt, who took the throne from Richard II. Henry IV’s son Henry V was the great warrior king who won a decisive victory against the French at Agincourt. Henry V’s son Henry VI became king when he was just a baby, and it was during his reign, that we saw the emergence of what we call today the Wars of the Roses. Finally, Cole tackles the Tudor kings, Henry VII and his second son Henry VIII.\n\nCole has done her research and given her readers a collection of biographies that are easy to read. Each king has his moment to shine, and Cole does not show favoritism as she explains important battles, events, policies, and changes to the law and religion that each king brought forth. If you want an excellent book that gives you an introductory course into the English kings named Henry, I would recommend “Harry of England: The History of Eight Kings, From Henry I to Henry VIII” by Teresa Cole.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we study human history, in general, we tend to pick a country and a period to focus on and research. Books on the subject material tend to focus on one land with interactions between other nations. It is infrequent for authors to take on multiple countries unless concentrated on one event that affected numerous locations. Those books often read like textbooks and can be a bit dry. Finding the perfect balance between these elements and engaging with the reader is a monumental task for any author, but Dan Jones has taken on the challenge. His latest behemoth tome, “Powers and Thrones: A New History of the Middle Ages,” takes on the gigantic task of telling the story of the Middle Ages from diverse perspectives.\n\nTo take on such a massive undertaking is no easy feat, but Jones seems to do it seamlessly. He breaks this book into four segments to not overwhelm his readers, each dealing with a different element that made the Middle Ages unique. Every story has a foundation, and the story of the Middle Ages begins with the fall of the Roman Empire. With the empire’s fall, we see the rise of Barbarian groups, the Byzantines, and the Arab states that would define this era with the Crusades. Jones takes his readers on a journey through climate change and pandemics that forced humanity to move from place to place to survive.\n\nWe encounter revolutions of all kinds; religious, political, artistic, architectural, and technological. Humankind was not as stagnant as many people believed during the Middle Ages. This was an age full of life and colorful figures that shaped the world around them, from philosophers and artists to kings and conquerors. Men and women like St. Aquitaine, Attila the Hun, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, and Christopher Columbus defined this era. Although Jones does focus on more European figures, he takes the time to show people groups like the Mongols, the Franks, the Arabs, and the Byzantines to show how diversity ruled this period in history. Those who study the Middle Ages know the stories of the Black Death, the Crusades, and the Sack of Rome, but there are so many more stories that give life to this period in human history.\n\nI felt nostalgic for my high school and college classes when I read this book. These were the classes that made me fall in love with studying history. Other stories in this book were brand new to me, which thrilled me to read. If there were an element that I wished he would have included, I think I would have liked to have seen more stories of medieval Asia and Africa. I think it would have added a new element to the story of the Middle Ages.\n\nOut of all of the books that I have read by Dan Jones, I think this one is my favorite. I could tell how much passion and the amount of research Jones poured into this book, and it shows. Combining over a thousand years of history into one book is an impressive feat that Jones has mastered. “Powers and Thrones: A New History of the Middle Ages” by Dan Jones is a triumphant tome that any fan of medieval history will appreciate.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWhen we think about love, we have ideas about how people fall in love through dating and wooing one another. Sweet words and gestures. Flowers and chocolate. Dates at fun venues and romantic dinners. This is a more modern interpretation of romance and love, which was vastly different than the concept of courtly love that was common in royal circles in medieval Europe. What exactly was courtly love, and how did it play a role in the Tudor dynasty? Sarah Gristwood explores this topic in her latest nonfiction book, “The Tudors in Love: The Courtly Code Behind the Last Medieval Dynasty.”\n\nBefore we dive head deep into Tudor history, Gristwood gives us a history lesson into the origins of courtly love and how it evolved. We begin with the 12th century and the stories of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and Lancelot that Chretien de Troyes wrote. Troyes’ romantic tales were known to Eleanor of Aquitaine and the troubadours that would spread them to every royal court in Europe. This game of romance between royals and the ideas of knights protecting their fair maidens from danger would change over time. Still, the basic idea that emotions and feelings were central to courtly love would remain prevalent. We see different authors, like Chaucer and Dante, approach the concept of courtly love from different directions and specific rules of this love game set in stone for future generations.\n\nGristwood traverses the complex family drama known as the Wars of the Roses to show how both Lancaster and York played the courtly game of love. The ways that the sides played the game were different with the various couples involved, but the ideas culminated with the marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. The imagery of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table were passed down to their sons, Prince Arthur and King Henry VIII. Henry VIII would play the game of courtly love with each of his six wives, with varying degrees of success. He would find out that courtly love and politics would be a complex combination to maintain, and this lesson would pass onto his children as they tried to play the game.\n\nEdward VI and Mary I tried to play the game, but they soon realized they were destined to be more involved with politics than love. It was their half-sister Elizabeth who brought back courtly love to its former glory with her numerous favorites. Although the actions of the Tudors can tell us a lot about their intentions, their letters and poetry gave a better understanding of how this courtly love game was played.\n\nI found the new information that Gristwood provided in this book was fascinating. It gave a new dimension to the Tudor dynasty and the relationships between the monarchy and their courtiers or mistresses. An innovative nonfiction book about love, chivalric stories, and the desire for power that any Tudor fan will adore. If you love books by Sarah Gristwood and learning new aspects about Tudor court life, you must have “The Tudors in Love: The Courtly Code Behind the Last Medieval Dynasty” in your collection.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
