        "text": "Jeanne (Joan, Johanna) became the countess of Champagne and the reigning queen of Navarre upon her fatherâ€™s death in 1274, with her mother as regent. In 1284, Jeanne married Philip IV and, a year later, became queen of France when he took the throne. A powerful political leader, she headed an army against the count de Bar when he attacked her lands. She was also a patron of arts and letters. Her most important contribution in this domain was the founding of the College of Navarre in Paris, stipulating in her will that fellowships be distributed based on need. She died in childbirth in 1305."
