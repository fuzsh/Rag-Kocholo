        "text": "Eleanor of Aquitaine (C. 1114 - November 14, 1154/5) was Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right making her the most powerful woman in Mideval Europe. She was first the daughter of Matilda of Saxony, and her father William X, Duke of Aquitaine, Eleanor's older brother William of Aquitaine was suppose to inherit Aquitaine, but when he and Eleanor's mother died of plauge in 1120, the unprepared 9 year old Eleanor became the heiress of Aquitaine. Aquitaine being the richest land in France, Eleanor was a popular bride. Her father married her to the future King of France when Eleanor was only 9, Eleanor's Louis of France, who was heir apparent to the Kingdom of the Franks. Eleanor's father feared upon his death, while Eleanor was visiting Aquitaine, nobles would kidnap Eleanor and marry her to take her lands. William took Eleanor to Paris and made sure Eleanor's regent was Louis the Fighter was made regent. Eleanor's father was later murdered on his way back to Aquitaine, by rebels who wanted Eleanor as Duchess. Eleanor at age 14 gave birth to Alix of France, Alix was a disapointment to Eleanor's husband Louis, and her father-in-law. Eleanor's marriage was almost annulled, but the pope refused to annul the marriage, Eleanor's father-in-law Louis the Fighter died, leaving the Crown of the Franks to Eleanor's husband. Louis who was now Louis VII was an abusive and demanding husband, Louis forced his wife to give him control of Aquitaine, but Eleanor soon refused and her husband never asked again. Eleanor gave birth to a son, and the birth was celebrated all over europe. Louis named there son Louis who became Co-King 7 days after his birth. Louis VII died in a crusade while on a boat to Jerusalem, the 17 year old Eleanor was the most supported regent of France, she was very popular, and very smart. But Eleanor was young and unprepared, but she still wanted to control France so she mantained regency, but Eleanor's rival Robert II, Duke of Bourbon attempted to assassinate Eleanor for the regency. Eleanor for now on killed anyone who challenged her, she was no longer a little girl, but a wise ruler. Eleanor wanted to make an alliance with Empress Matilda, who was fighting for control of England, Eleanor supported Matilda against King Stephan, and Eleanor married her eldest son Henry, Duke of Normandy, Matilda did die in 1128, but Stephan also died leaving England to Henry, Duke of Normandy. When that marriage turned sour, she supported her sons in the worst family feud in history, Eleanor died in 1154/5.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBirth\n\nEleanor's birth date is unknown, she was born in 1114 around December 15 or 18. Eleanor's parents were Matilda of Saxony, and William X, Duke of Aquitaine, her mother was only 15, and her father was 42. Eleanor as the oldest child was heiress, until her brother William was born. Eleanor often wrote of her brother's birth as \"The biggest mistake ever.\" Because he stole her place in line in the Duchy of Aquitaine.\n\nEarly Personal life\n\nEleanor was never regarded as her parents favourate, Eleanor had violent temper, and she was cruel to her siblings. Her father wrote down \"Nothing can make this spoiled girl happy.\" Eleanor's sisters Petronilla, and Sancha of Aquitaine were much more feminen. Eleanor was the smartest out of all her siblings, she knew Latin\\Sicilian\\Dutch\\Catalan\\French\\English\\Breton\\Aquitainian\\Leonese\\Aragonese\\Greek\\and Flemish, her mother Matilda saw a child knowing more languages as her brother the heir apparent was scandalous, so she attempted to stop Eleanor from learning, but Eleanor refused. Eleanor knew her sister Petronilla was the favourate, so Eleanor locked Petronilla in a room for 4 days without food hoping she would die, but she survived, but to be fair, Petronilla did try to push Eleanor down the stairs. Petronilla was rescued by guards after 4 days without food. Her parents were furious, and forced Eleanor to move out and gave her a palace in northern Aquitaine called Le château d'Hedwige which was owned by St. Hedwig of Bavaria.\n\nExile from Aquitaine\n\nEleanor suffered from mental illnesses like Bipolar disorder and possibly schizophrenia, those illnesses may have caused Eleanor's behavior. Her parents soon fear of Eleanor returning, they exiled her to Burgundy where Phillip I, Duke of Burgundy was reigning as Duke of Burgundy. Eleanor and Phillip had a less the a good relationship, Phillip did not want to raise Eleanor, nor did his wife Adzela of Poland. Eleanor also was rude, arragont, and careless, Eleanor would break a 7000 euro vase in front of Phillip and Adzela, and walk away like it was nothing. Eleanor did however get along with there daughter Mary of Burgundy, the 2 did not last after they got in a fight, Eleanor ended up brusing Mary on accident. She was exiled from Burgundy and sent to Hungary, the King Belá II raised her for only 6 weeks, until he was deposed by Belá III of Bohemia. Eleanor hated being exiled, she wanted to go back to Aquitaine where she could call her palace home at last.\n\nHeiress of Aquitaine\n\nEleanor's mother became very sick of plague, she could not walk, or speak, she died 6 days later. Eleanor was not sad at all that her mother was dead, and while she was in York in England being raised by Constance of York, she celebrated. Her brother William who was 4 years old died of plague 4 days after. Eleanor was now heiress, she was called back to Aquitaine to be sworn in as heiress. The nobles were very happy to have Eleanor back, as her father William was getting unpopular for his waste of money, Eleanor was cruel but very smart, and worthy of being duchess.\n\nBethrothal and Marriage\n\nAt age 9 and a half, the Grand Prince of Kiev was offered to Eleanor, the Prince Ivan II was 51, and Eleanor had no desire to be his wife, Ivan was heartbroken and Eleanor's rejection caused him to go mad, but understandbly Eleanor was beautiful and very eye-catching. But one powerful king Louis VI wanted Eleanor to marry his son Louis of France, who was the heir apparent to the Kingdom of the Franks. Eleanor who was 10 refused, but her father who was power hungry accepted the marriage, Eleanor had to be dragged on a boat, in order for her to get to her husband. Eleanor was married by proxy and was locked in a tower for 8 hours before let free. She was later married and pronounced future Queen.\n\nDuchess of Aquitaine\n\nEleanor and Louis did not get along, Louis was strict and had elegant manors, Eleanor was Harsh, Cruel, Rude, Selfish, Careless, unforgiving, Arragont, and disrespectful. Louis had many mistresses who were much more kind, but Eleanor was more popular at the French court, she did most of the heir apparent duties for Louis. Although Eleanor was not the kindest person ever, she had her personal charm, she was Beautiful, and giving to people who were kind to her. She also interested the people of her court with her stories when she was exiled, her mother-in-law, Adelaide of Maurienne was very fond of Eleanor's agro for her duties, when Eleanor was 12 her father was murdered and Eleanor became Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right, her father-in-law Louis VI became her regent until she was 16. Eleanor gave birth to a daughter Alix, who was a disapointment to both Louis's, Louis's mistress Marie de Sainte-Honorine ha already given birth to 3 sons. Eleanor's fear was being useless, she had already felt that way after her exiles from different lands. So she tried again.\n\nQueen of the Franks\n\n6 months after Alix's birth Louis VI died, Louis who was now Louis VII blamed Eleanor for Louis's death. Eleanor gave birth to a son also named Louis in 1125, this was a miricle and Louis VII celebrated but did not credit Eleanor for the baby's birth. Eleanor now Eleanor, Queen of the Franks felt she had more duties then giving birth to a son, she gave birth to Blanche that following month.\n\nA favor from Stephan of Blois\n\nIn 1126, Stephan of Blois or Stephan of England asked a favor from Eleanor. Eleanor never had liked Stephan at all, he was at war with Empress Matilda who was related to Eleanor, nevertheless Stephan was let in by Eleanor's husband Louis VII. Stephan begged Eleanor to ally herself with him, and allow him to march through Aquitaine, to reach England. Eleanor as refused and dismissed him from the meeting, instead Eleanor helped Empress Matilda whom the 2 became good friends. Eleanor helped Matilda and her son invade Normandy and Brittany, 2 territories that where being held by King Stephan. Sense Eleanor was pregnant with her fourth child, her ministers lead in army to help Matilda's, Stephan's son Eustance of Blois was held prisoner in Aquitaine. Stephan begged Eleanor to let Eustance free, but Eleanor instead had him murdered. Empress Matilda was the heir apparent but she died 3 months after the death of Eustance. Matilda's son Henry who was the Duke of Normandy became the heir.\n\nQueen Dowager of the Franks\n\nAfter the birth of her final child Agnes of France, her husband seemed to be very sick, he could not talk, and he refused to eat. It is uncertain what went wrong, but he died in his sleep. Eleanor did not shed a tear, but she just calmly walked to the court an announced the death of Louis. Eleanor's 5 year old son was now the King of France, but Eleanor was his Regent. Eleanor dismissed and took away everything Louis's mistresses had ever owned. The Duke of Bourbon attempted to kill Eleanor to become regent, but Eleanor's body guard stabbed the Duke in the chest. Eleanor was still very sad after the death of Empress Matilda, she wanted to make it up to her even in death and wanted to ally her self with her son who was now King Henry II. She trusted her mother-in-law Adelaide to act as regent for her son, and Eleanor took her 4 daughters to England in 1129.\n\nMarriage to Henry II\n\nEleanor had no desire to marry Henry II, even in how rich he was. Eleanor only planned to engage one of her daughters to the 27 year old King, the 17 year old came unexpectedly, when she was invited in, Henry and Eleanor talked, they soon relised they were in love, and Henry after 9 hours proposed to her, Eleanor without a doubt said yes and the pair where married the next morning, Eleanor was crowned Queen and Henry adored his new Queen, Eleanor made her husband co-ruler of Aquitaine. Adelaide, Eleanor's former mother-in-law celebrated the marriage between Eleanor and Henry, in France. Henry raised Eleanor's daughters and never called them \"Step-Daughters.\"\n\nFirst Crusade\n\nThe Pope invited Eleanor and Henry on a crusade, at first Eleanor was scared, she had never been to war, she had only seem the damage it had done to her father, she was also a mother to 3 more children, Henry the Young King (who was heir apparent), Prince Richard, and a daughter Constance of England. The first Crusade was to save Jerusalem and Byzantine empire from muslum invaders, Eleanor's husband told Eleanor that he would protect her. Eleanor then came along with her husband, they grabbed there crosses and set for a bloody crusade against the muslum invaders. Eleanor settled in Jerusalem where she attacked 89 enemies, Eleanor and Henry then allowed Konrad of Everstein to settle in as Count of Jerusalem. Eleanor and her husband were praised as heros. Irene of Antioch wrote in an ilastrated mideval novel, that Eleanor was the fiercest woman warior in all woman wariors. The Byzantine empire was protected by the Hungarians who allied themselves wit England in the crusades, Eleanor to create a closer alliance, married her third child Blanche to the Hungarian king, Ladislaus II of Hungary.\n\nImprisonment of Petronilla of Aquitaine\n\nPetronilla fled to England when the county of Flanders was being invaded by Lorriane. Eleanor did not trust her sister, so she instead imprisoned her and her husband, she had her husband murdered, and Eleanor took away her children and raised them by herself. Petronilla never forgave Eleanor and ignored her everytime. Eleanor so sick of being ignored ran a sword through her sister which nearly hit her. Eleanor started to feel bad for her sister, but the nobles of England killed Petronilla out of dis-trust. Eleanor was furious, but she hid her fury behind a smile.\n\nAlliance with the Byzantine's\n\nEleanor wanted the Byzantine empire to continue, so she married her youngest daughter Agnes of France to Alexois III, Agnes was only 11, she had no desire to marry the Emperor, but she did to continue her duty. Agnes's dowry was 1000 francis. Agnes would become a well known crusader at age 15. When Agnes turned 13, she gave birth to her first child Constantine who was a crusader in the 15th Crusade.\n\nSecond Crusade\n\nIn 1136 the Pope had a feud with the Ottoman empire over Jerusalem and Antioch, the Ottomans started an invasion in Jerusalem, this horrified the europeans, Eleanor of Aquitaine and her husband started preparing there armies in Brittany, Anjou, Aquitaine, Angoulême, Nantes, and Poiters. Eleanor allied herself with Champagne which was a county in France, Eleanor married her 14 year old daughter Alix to the Baldwin II, Count of Champagne. Now having Champange as an ally, the county and the kingdom sent there troops in the same camps and they marched together singing \"Miri it is while summer ilast,\" even though it was winter. They marched through Italy, and then through Sicily, then at last they were in Greece, Eleanor met her daughter there and the troops were celebrated in a castle, all the troops all got free wine and cakes, and then they marched to Jerusalem where they helped Konrad reconquer Jerusalem and they chased the Ottomans out of Antioch. The troops celebrated there victory and sung \"We raige victorius\" in honor of Eleanor of Aquitaine. When Alix turned 15, it was the age a crusader would began crusading, Eleanor feared if another crusade happened, Alix would have no idea how to crusade, so Eleanor's husband taught all of Eleanor's children with Louis VII, how to crusade.\n\nSon's marriage\n\nWhen Eleanor was 37 she already had 13 grand-children, her son was 15 and a crusader king, but still unmarried, so Eleanor convinced the Queen of Navarre who was Joan I to marry her son. Joan had already taught of marrying the King of Naples, but Joan trusted Eleanor and married Louis. Joan was crowned Queen of France when she was 15. Joan was 4 months older then Louis, but Louis always taught of himself as the older one. Eleanor wanted Joan to also become a crusader against the ottomans, Joan had little to no interest in war at first, but she began thinking about becoming a crusader, Joan was taught by Henry II. Joan was now the 37th woman crusader, many more woman crusaders joined in later. that following year Joan gave birth to a son Charles who became the future King of Navarre and France.\n\nThird Crusade\n\nEleanor knew very well the next crusade was coming, she prepared her militaries and she helped her allies prepare theres. Eleanor's daughter-in-law, Joan I prepared her armies in Navarre and was the first responder to the third crusade, while Joan's army was in northern France, Alix did not know what to do, she was only 17, and Alix had her own priorities, Alix had 3 children, and she had alliances to make with her children, but Alix knew what she had to do, so Alix kept her children in the care of the Arch-Bishop and Alix and her army marched north to Venice, in Hungary Blanche was only 14, but she was close enough to being 15, Blanche was very fast to go on a crusade, she was reckless and loud when she led troops to northern Bohemia, Eleanor met Blanche in Bohemia while she was going to Serbia, the Hungarian-Bohemian-Croatian and English-French army marched together, and the Byzantine's joined the march 3 weeks later. Eleanor's son Louis took over Antioch and made himself Prince of Antioch, the Ottoman's responded by taking over Egypt which belonged to Venice, Venice which was a bread basket of Europe at the time had many powerful allies who were all angry at the ottomans, Eleanor responded back by helping Konrad kill the most powerful ottoman warior who was Abdul Ali Ramor who was a hero to the ottomans, this defeat weakened the ottomans because they did not have Abdul.\n\nNotable Crusaders on the third Crusade\n\nMain Article: Famous Crusaders on the Third Crusade\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine\n\nBlanche of France\n\nHenry II of England\n\nLouis VIII of France\n\nLadislaus II of Hungary\n\nGretudela of Lorriane\n\nHelene of Lorriane\n\nIrene of Antioch\n\nConstance of Aragon\n\nFredrick I, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nPhillipa of Guelders\n\nJoanna of Aragon\n\nAgnes of France\n\nJoan I of Navarre\n\nBerengaria of Navarre\n\nConstance of Castile\n\nHenry II, Duke of Bavaria\n\nLorgartha of Lorriane\n\nRobert, 8th Earl of Cornwall\n\nCharles I, Duke of Bourbon\n\nIrene of the Palatine\n\nMafalda of Molina\n\nJohn, 7th Earl of Wiltshire\n\nCatherine of Brunswick\n\nPreparing for the fourth crusade\n\nEleanor knew very well this was not the last crusade, her daughter Blanche was already preparing her armies for an invasion of Bosnia and Serbia, Eleanor needed more allies, she married her 12 year old son Henry the Young to Mary of Gloucester, who was heiress to the Dukedom of Gloucester, Eleanor's now 18 year old son was preparing an invasion of eastern Turkey, Louis's wife Joan was preparing to crusade in Jordan so Ottoman's would not attack her. Henry and Henry the young king fought on who should act as regent, this was the begining of the family feud, but it was not a big one yet, sense Konrad was dead, Konrad's brother Baldwin became Baldwin II, Count of Jaffa (Jaffa was a reigon in Jerusalem), and Konrad's son Fulk was trying to regain Jerusalem from the Ottomans, Alix who was now 23 started invading unclaimed lands in Jerusalem because they were undefended. The Crusade was not announced yet, but they new it was coming in less them 6 days. Eleanor travled to Paris to meet up, 17 year old Agnes of France took her children in protection of the Arch-Bishop, the pope announced the fourth crusade a day later.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade\n\nAlix of France went with Eleanor's husband Henry, and Eleanor went with Joan I of Navarre. Joan and Eleanor wen't to Lebanon and launched a live donkey as an insult to the Ottoman emperor, the Donkey hit the Emperor's 16 year old heir apparent who died after being hit with a donkey and falling over, this angered the emperor who launched \"Jahad\" or a Holy War against the united European forces. Blanche of France who was with Louis VIII killed the ottoman emperor's ambassador and stuck his head on a pike. Agnes of France led an army into Turkey and conquered western Turkey, the Ottoman's responded by burning down greek villages, Eleanor responded by having one of her assasians stab the ottoman ruler, the next in line was the brother Mehmed I. Mehmed was a just king, but not as fierce as the forces, but he did all he had, he publicly executed French and English crusaders and banned any european visitor from entering the empire. Alix of France's husband was killed in the crusades, so Alix was now regent for her 6 year old son Charles II of Blois. Alix remarried Fulk who was regaining Jerusalem, Alix was crowned Queen of Jerusalem and later Countess of Jaffa after the crusades and they had 5 children which 2 of them became kings.\n\nHusband's invasion of Ireland\n\nIreland was undefended and considered a weak country, when Ireland tried to enter the crusades, the pope refused because of how useless the country was. Henry II was looking to increase his empire and wanted to get a big but weak country to do so, the council advised Henry that what he was doing was a good thing for England because it would increase the countries size. Eleanor stayed and acted as regent of England, when she returned her husband had invaded most of what is now Ireland, the plan was that the eldest Henry the Young would take England and Brittany, the second Prince Richard would marry Berengaria of Navarre and take Aquitaine, Anjou, Normandy, Nantes, Poiters, and Angouleme, and Eleanor's youngest son John who was 8 years old would take Ireland for himself. But the 16 year old Henry and the 15 year old Prince Richard wanted more, Richard and Henry started feuding on who should take what, and Henry instead stated that his favourate John should take everything, this upset them both and Eleanor, Eleanor started fighting that her favorate Prince Richard, should take everything.\n\nStart of the family feud\n\nHenry and Eleanor's \"Happy\" marriage started breaking down, Eleanor wanted her personal favourate son Richard who was also Duke of Cornwall to take everything, Eleanor started by giving her son the title heir apparent of the Duchy of Aquitaine, Henry the young King did not like the union and sent an army in Somerset and marched to Aquitaine in an attempted to invade it before being stopped by his half-brother Louis VIII who supported his mother's claim to it. Eleanor married her 13 year old daughter Constance to the King of Sicily, Henry II wanted Constance to marry the King of Aragon and blamed Eleanor for the \"unwanted marriage\" according to him. Eleanor removed Henry II's power as \"Co-Monarch\" and allowed her son Prince Richard to act as Co-Duke of Aquitaine. Constance supported Henry the Young King's claim to everything but managed to keep it a secret from her Richard-loving mother. Constance sent a secret army in Henry the Young kings service just incase he would need it, that year the family in feud was informed the 5th Crusade was happening soon, Henry the Young king started by taking his sister Constance of England to Somerset and preparing there plans, Constance even though she was 13, the rules changed to at least 12 years old, so Constance and her younger sister Isabella of England were now official crusaders, the broken family had a plan for the crusades, Henry II's council would act as regent, Henry would take Constance to Cyprus and after they kicked all the ottomans out, they would head for Turkey, Eleanor of Aquitaine would take Prince Richard and Isabella to Jaffa and crusade there, Henry II would take his step-daughter Marie, Countess of Champange to Bulgaria and chase the ottomans out, and then head to Greece to protect the Byzantine empire, Louis and Joan I would go to Jaffa and chase any ottomans or possible usurpers out, Blanche and her husband had a plan to invade northern Bulgaria and make it a christian kingdom, Alix who was Queen of Jerusalem would acompany her husband Fulk I to chase the ottoman forces and kill them.\n\nThe Bloody 5th Crusade\n\nThe most famous crusaders of the 5th Crusade was Constance of England, and Henry the Young King, at first Constance did not want to go crusading. She was only 13 years old and was scared she would die, but Henry the Young King who was known to be a great brother to Constance ensured her she would be fine, Henry held Constance's hand as they went sailing to Cyprus. Constance and Henry had no idea how bloody this crusade would be, Henry had fought in the 4th Crusade as a meer knight in his fathers army, but he thought this crusade would just be stabbing people, but it was actually bows an arrows and fires being launched. On there ship to Cyprus, Henry and Constance practiced sword fighting with each other, they laughed and joked and tried there best to forget the crusade. When they arrived they dressed in there armor and Henry made sure Constance was by his side, Henry and Constance where almost shot with 17 arrows which were being fired on both sides, Constance and Henry launched 9 torches on an Ottoman army which set on fire, Constance then found out the savagery of the crusades, but did not give up, Constance dodged an arrow with fire which was suppose to hit both her and Henry. After the bloody lust in Cyprus, they replaced the monarch with a christian king named James III. Henry and Constance then moved to Turkey to meet the lust of the Ottoman empire. Henry launched 18 live donkeys into the ottoman bases, and 736 live donkeys at the ottoman palace which broke 80 windows. Then they slaughtered millions of ottomans, after the blood lust, Henry the Young and Constance returned to Brittany where the celebrated there victory.\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine, Prince Richard, and Isabella of England arrived in Jaffa in 1146, Isabella road her horse to a Jaffan neighborhood and set them on fire, Richard who was known to be a great military leader. The three was met by the now 19 year olds Louis and Joan who had just launched 9 live donkeys at an Ottoman palaces. Eleanor then set sail to Bosnia where her daughter Blanche's husband was ruling as Grand Duke, they then then moved back to London.\n\nHenry II and Marie sailed to Athens and met Agnes of France, Henry went with Marie as even though he was not his daughter, Marie was Henry's favourate alongside Prince John. Marie and Henry where at first shipwrecked to Sicily, the Sicilian king was very fond of Henry II, the King of Sicily and Henry II sailed with each other to Athens. Marie was ruthless, she was scary to her enemies, she kidnapped the ottoman emperor's 19 wives and imprisoned them in Brittany, the wives were all strangled or murdered by servents. After the lust they wen't to Normandy to celebrate.\n\nThe others including Alix defeated the Ottomans in the 5th Crusade, after that everyone hoped for no more crusades, but they were wrong, very wrong.\n\nRise of the Family Feud\n\nHenry II wanted his now 10 year old son to inherit England more then ever, Henry gave John the heir apparent title of the Lordship of Ireland. Constance was furious because she believed sense Henry the Young King was the eldest, he should be king. Eleanor believed the best warior should be king, the best warior was of course Prince Richard. Henry the Young king though was the most popular, he did not believe in taxing the people to much. the 15 year old Constance and Henry the Young King declared war on Henry II. Constance who was in Sicily with her son Robert II of Sicily, she left the regency to the official concil, and went to Normandy to prepare the army, Henry and Constance raided Somerset and York, but while Henry was raiding London, he fell of a bridge and stabbed in the chest by his father's knight. Constance was devastated, knowing she was next she fled back to Sicily. Now Constance sided with her older brother Prince Richard. When Isabella of England turned 14, her parents had a huge feud over who she would marry. Eleanor thought Isabella should marry the Count of Perche, but Henry married Isabella to Fredrick II, Holy Roman Emperor without Eleanor's permission. Eleanor soon married her 13 year old daughter Eleanor, to Alfonso VII of Castile, and Eleanor also married her 11 year old daughter Joan, to the King of Naples, without Henry's permission. Henry was furious, he attempted to arrest his wife, but the guards refused to arrest her. But during there violent fight, a priest knocked on the door, he came to inform Eleanor that the 6th Crusade was starting in 4 days. Eleanor looked down, and then said \"I will prepare my army, thank you my lord.\" Eleanor then locked the door of her room and burst into tears. But she knew what was right for her country, and ignored the feud with her family and prepared.\n\nThe lust of the 6th Crusade\n\nThat following day, Eleanor ignored her husband for the whole day and prepared her armies, Eleanor's daughter Isabella would be helping her alongside her husband Fredrick II. Prince Richard who was the heir apparent of the English crown took his younger sister Constance of England with him to Anjou where they rallied there army. Constance was met with her aunt and uncle Joan and Louis who were going to Jerusalem, Constance and Richard said there fairwells to Joan and Louis as they set sail to Turkey. Constance knew the savage life of a warroir and feared her death, she oversaw the death of her brother Henry the Young, but Richard promised to protect Constance. In Turkey there ship was attacked, Eleanor and Isabella quickly went to Turkey to save her children, Constance and Richard where almost killed, Eleanor swapped the plans, Richard would go with Eleanor to Jaffa, and Isabella was given to Constance as she brought her to Syria. Isabella and Constance where taken prisoner after there capture, they were let free by there aunt Joan I who brought them to Greece which was a much safer place to crusade, Eleanor in Jaffa helped Fulk IV become Count of Jaffa. Alix died that year of plague, Alix's son with Fulk II was the current king, Fulk crusaded in Syria which was the second bloodiest place to crusade after Jaffa. Constance and Isabella crusaded in Albania and killed the govenor, Albania became part of Hungary 9 days after. But the Ottoman's were regaining Syria, Eleanor of Aquitaine needed more of her children to crusade, her now 13 year old daughter Eleanor who was Queen of Castile was a good age to start crusading, Eleanor found an approtunity to invite Eleanor of England to crusade, Eleanor's husband who was a crusader was also a fan of this plan, Eleanor of England began Crusading in Jerusalem. Eleanor of Aquitaine after helping Fulk invade Jaffa, wen't to Syria with Richard to Crusade.
