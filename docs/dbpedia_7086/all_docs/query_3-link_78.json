        "text": "Eleanor, duchess of Aquitaine (1124-1204), is likely the best known medieval queen, first consort of Louis VII of France, of Henry II of England. Despite medieval churchmen's teachings of women’s innate inferiority and subordination to males, she lived as she saw fit, seeking political power. Eleanor paid heavily for her pursuit of power, subjected to scurrilous gossip beginning on the Second Crusade, and spreading to the West. Medieval teachings ascribed women’s actions to irrational, sentimental or libidinous motives, and clerical writers attributed her rifts with her two husbands to personal, not political factors. A 'Black Legend' grew up that haunted her over the centuries.\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine (1124-1204) ranks as a favourite of modern biographers, and in the twentieth-century writings on this twelfth-century personality attained the proportions of a 'romanticizing \"Eleanor industry\".' 1 In approaching Eleanor, historians today face the sharply differing standards of her medieval contemporaries, modern scholars, and popular writers in depicting a powerful woman's place in medieval society and government. Because of this, the twelfth century's most famous woman can provoke either modern biographers' 'uncritical enthusiasm, or else curiously grudging dismissal'. 2 Perhaps the primary example of the enthusiastic approach is Amy Kelly's Eleanor of Aquitaine and the Four Kings, first published over a half century ago and still in print. 3 W. L. Warren's dismissal of Eleanor in his biography of her second husband, Henry II shows the grudging attitude, 'To judge from the chroniclers, the most striking fact about Eleanor is her utter insignificance in Henry II's reign.' 4\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine has undoubtedly suffered more than most historical figures from excessive mythologising, and as a result has “inspired some of the very worst historical writing devoted to the European Middle Ages”. In the 1940s and 1950s Frank Chambers and H.G. Richardson made the first sallies in attempting to dispel the more lurid parts of the legend surrounding Eleanor, one which was (and would continue to be) widely propagated by scholars and those involved in the less factually conscionable spheres of literature, film and painting in which Eleanor has proved so perpetually fascinating. Chambers, however, argued that “these stories, false as they are, generally have some basis in fact”. This demonstrates the problem of disentangling the fact from the fiction when it comes to the study of Eleanor. However, these early attempts to “dismantle the mythic scaffolding that has encased her for centuries” did not initially attract much attention. This is testimony to the lasting power and endurance of Eleanor’s legend which has continued to influence modern historians. However, it would be fair to state that in recent decades historians have made important re-appraisals of Eleanor, rehabilitating her reputation and dismantling the mythology which surrounds her."
