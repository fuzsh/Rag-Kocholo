        "text": "Eleanor of England (C. 1133 - 1172) was Queen Consort of Castile and Toledo, by her marriage to Alfonso VIII of Castile. Eleanor was the 5th child of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England, and a famous crusader. Eleanor was her older half-sister Blanche's favouarte sister.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nEleanor of England was born the twin sister of Isabella of England in Normandy, in 1133. Eleanor was described as the \"Darling child\" of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England, for her sincerity and passion, but on the inside Eleanor was a cruel monster like the rest of her sisters. Her half-siblings names were Alix of France, Louis VIII of France, Blanche of France, Marie and St. Agnes of France. Her full-siblings were Henry the Young King, Richard the Lionheart, Constance the Cruel/Mad, Isabella, John, Joan, Matilda and last but not least Margaret of England. John was close to her half-sister Blanche who called Eleanor \"Ellie.\"\n\nEducation[]\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine valued Eleanor's education deeply, and hired her a governess who was known as \"Lady Kitty\" by Eleanor, though her real name was Lady Katherine Veldon. Eleanor and her Governess/teacher moved to Brittany to start Eleanor's education, Eleanor was educated in the arts, and music, she was taught how to nit and dance, 2 passions her grand-mother Empress Matilda was fond of. Eleanor was given the standard education of a mideval Princess, when \"Lady Kitty\" died, Eleanor was devastated, her new teacher was Lady Joan de Warenne, who was an Irish noblewoman, when Joan arrived, Eleanor was very rude to her, Eleanor purposly tripped her and when she cried, she pushed her down the stairs, which earned her the nickname \"The dangerous Princess.\" Joan had no idea how to be a strict teacher, and let Eleanor do whatever she wanted, much to the anger of Eleanor's mother. When Joan finally was pregnant she was very excited that she was finally a mother, put the cruel Princess pushed Joan, which caused a miss-carriage, this was the first time Joan got angry at Eleanor and punished her by whipping her with an Iron rod, Eleanor came wounded with cuts on her back and told her mother Joan had tortured her, Eleanor's mother believed her and murdered Joan and her husband, Eleanor again had a third teacher whom Eleanor was even crueler to, the new teachers name was Lady Phillipa Drummond, who was an Irish-Scottish Noblewoman, Phillipa brought her own daughter Elizabeth Drummond, to be educated with Eleanor. Elizabeth was very shy, and tried to act nice to Eleanor, but Eleanor made fun of her, Phillipa was a more stricter teacher and yelled at the Princess, but Eleanor had another idea, that night, the 13 year old strangled Elizabeth to death, Elizabeth could be heard screaming, when Phillipa came in, she was so devastated, she became a weak teacher, Eleanor at last murdered her teacher and moved to Dover Castle with her sister Constance who was known as \"Constance the Mad or the Cruel\" for her cruelty, Eleanor quickly became close to Constance who was the least favourate daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England.\n\nBetrothal[]\n\nEleanor was Betrothed to Sancho of Castile who was the eldest child and heir of Blanche of Navarre, and Sancho III of Castile. When Sancho was 14, he died of malaria, leaving the place in succession to his younger brother Alfonso of Castile, Alfonso's parents wanted to keep the Anglo-Castilian alliance with England, so Eleanor's younger sister Matilda, was betrothed to Alfonso, and Eleanor was betrothed to the King of Aragon, but Matilda's parents chose to marry Matilda to the Duke of Bavaria, and Eleanor's engagement to the King of Aragon broke, and Eleanor was betrothed to Alfonso of Castile, which this engagement lasted, 4 days after there betrothal, they were wed in Toledo.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nWhen Eleanor was 15, she made her way with her 16 year old husband to her new home, Eleanor was greeted by the Castilian's, Eleanor was educated in Catalan and Spanish, and impressed her new court with her knowledge. Eleanor brought 62 ladies in waiting from England, 43 from France, and 78 from Castile. Eleanor was named \"Wife of the Heir to Castile.\" Blanche of Navarre was a strict and stern woman, she hated Eleanor and even before the betrothal, attempted to wed Alfonso to Constance of Portugal. But Alfonso was fond of his bride, and he was the first and only Castilian king to not have a mistress, Eleanor's father-in-law Sancho was also fond of his new daughter-in-law, he nicknamed her \"Lionetta.\" But Eleanor was considered a threat to her sister-in-laws, one of them Blanche of Portugal who married Eleanor's brother-in-law, Infante Ferdinand of Castile, was rude to Eleanor, Eleanor in response was cold to her and made a fool out of her name, which her mother-in-law scolded her for, but Eleanor did not fear her mother-in-law at all, which made her baffled.\n\n8th Crusade[]\n\nWhen the Pope called the 8th Crusade, Eleanor wanted to please her new kingdom by going with her husband. At this time she was pregnant and was forced to stay home for 4 months to in Castile, so her baby would be okay, Eleanor gave birth to a daughter Berengaria of Castile, sense Berengaria was not a son, Eleanor's position of Queen was weak, Blanche of Navarre made fun of her which caused Eleanor to publically expell Blanche from her court, Blanche was baffled and alerted Sancho who forced Eleanor to allow Blanche to return, Berengaria was put in the care of her ladies-in-waiting, and Eleanor went on crusade to forget about her problems in Castile, Alfonso was pleased when he heard the birth of Berengaria even though she was a girl, Berengaria joined her sister Constance in the 6th Crusade, after the crusade she wen't home to go on a Reconquista in Granada.\n\nQueen of Castile[]\n\nIn 1150, Sancho wen't hunting with Alfonso, while Eleanor was pregnant. A few hours later Alfonso told Eleanor he could not find Sancho, and that he needed help, Eleanor searched for hours, but could not find him, at last Alfonso found Sancho dead with an arrow in his chest, Alfonso probably had accidently murdered his father, but Alfonso certainly was not sheding any tears and celebrated with his wife that they were now king and Queen of Castile and Toledo. That following day Eleanor was crowned and her sister's in law were horrified, her first act was to murder her mother-in-law, Eleanor imprisoned Blanche of Navarre without her husband's permission, and stabbed her in the bath-tub, Eleanor blamed an innocent knight on the murder.

When the Queen of Portugal, Elizabeth of Aragon was invited to Castile, she was offended by Eleanor's arragonce and was uncomfortable around her. Eleanor was so arragont, she tried to make the weather obey her, even her 6 year old daughter cringed at her arragonce. Eleanor's husband also cringed at Eleanor's arragonce at times and laughed uncomfortably.

Mafalda was raised by nuns who became her family. Eleanor sent herself back on crusade with her knights to Hungary. After the 9th Crusade, her husband became desprate for a son to please the people and begged Eleanor to go to bed with him, and she did so.\n\nA son[]\n\nSoon, Eleanor gave birth in Toledo to a son named \"Infante John.\" He was created Heir to Castile, and his birth was celebrated, though John was not the favourate like Urracca, but he was the second favourate, John outranked the heiress Berengraria, and Berengaria was stripped from her titles a \"Heiress\" and named \"Infanta of Castile\" which Berengaria threw a fit, because she had to give her title up. John was by no means a smart heir, he lacked interest in war, much to his father's disapointment, he found more interest in poetry and music which was considered, \"A feminen\" activity. John failed in writing and many woman found him unatractive, Eleanor attempted to mend John, but he was still very unsmart.\n\nReconquista[]\n\nEleanor was an active Queen in the Reconquista, she and her 11 year old daughter held parties on honor for knights who were fighting the the Reconquista.
